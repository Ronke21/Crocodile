<text>The Erie SeaWolves are an American professional baseball team based in Erie, Pennsylvania. They compete in Minor League Baseball (MiLB) as a member of the Eastern League&#x27;s Southwest Division, serving as the Double-A affiliate of the Detroit Tigers. The team was founded in 1989 and began playing in Erie for the 1995 season. The SeaWolves currently play their home games at UPMC Park in downtown Erie, next door to Erie Insurance Arena and the Warner Theatre.

The &quot;SeaWolves&quot; name refers to the city&#x27;s location along Lake Erie as well as their original affiliation with the Pittsburgh Pirates. &quot;Sea wolf&quot; is a historical epithet for sailors who engaged in piracy.

==History==
The team was established in 1989 in Welland, Ontario as a New York–Penn League member, known initially as the Welland Pirates, playing their home games at Welland Stadium. After six challenging seasons, the team relocated to Erie following the exit of the previous baseball team, the Erie Sailors. This move eventually led the Frontier League-affiliated club to settle in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where they became the Johnstown Steal (currently known as the Florence Y&#x27;alls in Florence, Kentucky). Before this, the Sailors had played in the New York–Penn League but relocated to Wappingers Falls, New York, becoming the Hudson Valley Renegades, due to the team&#x27;s owner, Marvin Goldklang not upgrading Ainsworth Field to meet Major League Baseball standards.

After the civic government obtained an $8 million grant from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to construct UPMC Park (previously known as Jerry Uht Park), the Welland Pirates relocated to Erie. Although Erie did not have an affiliated baseball team in 1994, the city hosted an independent franchise in the Frontier League that revived the &quot;Sailors&quot; name. The SeaWolves eventually became the successor to several Erie-based baseball teams, including all iterations of the Sailors, with the New York–Penn League franchise now known as the State College Spikes.

===Early years (1995–2001)===

On June 20, 1995, the SeaWolves triumphed over the Jamestown Jammers in their inaugural game in Erie. José Guillén, a Major League Baseball alumnus from the Dominican Republic, hit the game-winning home run for the team.

The SeaWolves were affiliated with the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1995 to 1998. In 1999, the Double-A Eastern League expanded by adding two new franchises, with Erie being granted one of them. As a result, the team transitioned from the Short-Season A level to the Double-A level, and the current SeaWolves organization is considered a continuation of the previous franchise despite this change in classification. Minor League Baseball permitted Erie to retain its New York–Penn League records and history while joining the Eastern League. Subsequently, the Mahoning Valley Scrappers entered the New York–Penn League as an expansion franchise rather than a continuation of the SeaWolves. After moving to the Double-A level, the team affiliated with the Anaheim Angels. In 2001, the SeaWolves switched their affiliation to the Detroit Tigers, with whom they still have a partnership.

===Realignment (2021)===
In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the SeaWolves were organized into the Double-A Northeast. In 2022, the Double-A Northeast became known as the Eastern League, the name historically used by the regional circuit before the 2021 reorganization.

===Championships (2023–2024)===

On September 26, 2023, the SeaWolves completed a full sweep of the playoffs, capped off by a 10–0 win over the Binghamton Rumble Ponies in Game 2 of the Eastern League Championship Series, leading to their first championship title in franchise history.

On September 24, 2024, the SeaWolves completed their playoff run by defeating the Somerset Patriots 3-2 in Bridgewater, New Jersey. They won the Eastern League championship for a second straight year. In addition, they became the 11th team in Eastern League history and the first since the Trenton Thunder in 2007 and 2008 to repeat as champions.

==Ownership==
Palisades Baseball was the original owner of the SeaWolves when the team began play in 1995. In 2003, Palisades sold the team to Mandalay Sports Entertainment, which had previously owned and operated several Minor League Baseball clubs. On March 27, 2015, Fernando Aguirre was announced as the new owner of the SeaWolves. A seasoned executive from Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) and Chiquita Brands International, Aguirre purchased the team from Mandalay for an undisclosed amount and expressed his commitment to keeping the team in Erie. Aguirre also holds a minority share in the Cincinnati Reds of Major League Baseball and possesses a one-third stake in the Myrtle Beach Pelicans, the Single-A affiliate of the Chicago Cubs in the Carolina League.

==Logos and uniforms==
The SeaWolves&#x27; primary colors are black, red, and white, complemented by minor accents of gold and gray. Their primary logo features a stylized &quot;pirate wolf&quot; positioned over two intersecting baseball bats with sword hilts. The wordmark arches in alignment with the wolf&#x27;s tricorne, using a color scheme of white, black, and gold. Additionally, the SeaWolves have a secondary logo that depicts a weathered Jolly Roger on a &quot;bat sword,&quot; highlighted by a red letter E. This emblem pays homage to Erie&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Flagship City,&quot; which references the Flagship &quot;Niagara&quot;, commanded by Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry during his 1813 victory over the British Royal Navy in the Battle of Lake Erie.

The home uniforms consist of a black cap adorned with the &quot;bandanna wolf&quot; logo and white jerseys with black piping. The &quot;SeaWolves&quot; wordmark arches across the front in black letters outlined in red, while the crossed &quot;bat swords&quot; logo appears on the left sleeve. The away uniforms feature a gray jersey with black piping, showcasing the &quot;Erie&quot; wordmark in red with a black outline and the crossed &quot;bat swords&quot; logo on the left sleeve. Additionally, the alternate jersey is red with black piping and includes the &quot;Erie&quot; wordmark in white outlined in black, with the &quot;tricorne wolf&quot; logo featured on the left sleeve. 

==Culture==
===Mascots===
The Erie SeaWolves&#x27; official mascot is an anthropomorphic, gray Canidae named C. Wolf. He wears the team&#x27;s official red alternate jersey with a pirate hat, a red and white bandana, and an eye patch. His friends include Paws (the Detroit Tigers&#x27; official mascot) as well as three anthropomorphic sausages sponsored by the Erie-based Smith&#x27;s Provision Company: Kenny Kielbasa, Herbie Hot Dog, and Santino the Italian Sausage.

===Promotions===
====Alternative Facts Night====
On March 10, 2017, the Erie SeaWolves made national headlines for their &quot;Alternative Facts Night&quot; promotion on Friday, August 25, 2017. Their opponent was the Akron RubberDucks, whose alternative name was the &quot;Akron Yellow Bath Toys&quot; for the game. The promotion was a reference to a news story in which Kellyanne Conway, counselor to U.S. president, Donald Trump, coined the phrase &quot;alternative facts&quot; to bolster a disputed claim that more people attended Trump&#x27;s presidential inauguration on January 20, 2017 than the first inauguration of Barack Obama on January 20, 2009. The SeaWolves hosted Alternative Facts Night to &quot;celebrate facts that the team knows to be true—even if some media outlets may dispute them.&quot; As part of the promotion, the first 1,000 fans received a 2016 SeaWolves Eastern League Championship ring, although the RubberDucks earned the title. The club notionally expected to have 1.2 million fans attend the game between Erie and Akron, even though UPMC Park only has a seating capacity of 6,000. The proceeds for Alternative Facts Night went to the Erie City School District.

In anticipation of &quot;Alternative Facts Night,&quot; Fernando Aguirre published a message on Twitter that read, &quot;This is huge! #AlternativeFactsNight. We will build a [right field] wall, and Akron will pay for it. I promise.&quot; This was a parody of Donald Trump&#x27;s political campaign, in which he stated, &quot;I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I&#x27;ll build them very inexpensively—I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.&quot;

===Community service===
The SeaWolves engage in many philanthropic efforts throughout Erie and its surrounding communities. Key team initiatives include UPMC Health Plan Paint the Park Pink Weekend to benefit local cancer charities, Northwest Bank Gloves for Kids equipment drive, and Sensory-Friendly Day at the Ballpark in partnership with the Autism Society of Northwest Pennsylvania. The team also sponsors youth sports and education programs through the SeaWolves Community Fund. On September 16, 2015, the SeaWolves earned the &quot;Erie Times-News&quot; Commitment to Erie Award for community service by a business with 50 or fewer employees.

==Broadcasting==
In February 2017, the SeaWolves extended their broadcasting contract with Fox Sports Radio AM 1330: The Fan, a local affiliate of Connoisseur Media, to air every game during the 2017 and 2018 seasons. Greg Gania has served as the Voice of the SeaWolves since 2006 and is the longest-tenured play-by-play broadcaster in team history.

<doc id="672356" wikidata="Q7982179" url="?curid=672356" title="Wembley Downs, Western Australia">
<text>Wembley Downs is a northwestern suburb of Perth, Western Australia. It is about 10 km from the central business district.

==History==
The name &quot;Wembley Downs&quot; is derived from the name of the local golf course and the name was used by residents before being officially approved in 1959. The golf course was named after the suburb of Wembley, located one kilometer to the east of Wembley Downs. The name &quot;Wembley&quot; originates from a town in England.

In 1927 Wembley Downs was subdivided into approximately 90 lots. Development was slow, due partly to the thick virgin bush and limestone outcrops, which made building difficult. In 1947 the Perth Road Board had to resume 600 blocks for unpaid rates, and these were sold at very low prices. However, growth accelerated in the 1950s, and by the 1970s the area was almost completely developed. The key defining demographic characteristics of the Wembley Downs area are its predominantly family household structure and higher income levels relative to most other areas of the City of Stirling and the Perth metropolitan area.

Hale School, a selective and private Anglican boys&#x27; school, is located in Wembley Downs along with a state primary school and &quot;The Downs&quot;, a small shopping centre which burnt down in October 2008.
The street plan of Wembley Downs was designed in the 1960s in the &quot;garden suburb&quot; formation, in a circular pattern around the main intersection at Hale and Weaponess Roads.

<doc id="672358" wikidata="Q2556395" url="?curid=672358" title="Type II string theory">
<text>In theoretical physics, type II string theory is a unified term that includes both type IIA strings and type IIB strings theories. Type II string theory accounts for two of the five consistent superstring theories in ten dimensions. Both theories have formula_1 extended supersymmetry which is maximal amount of supersymmetry — namely 32 supercharges — in ten dimensions. Both theories are based on oriented closed strings. On the worldsheet, they differ only in the choice of GSO projection. They were first discovered by Michael Green and John Henry Schwarz in 1982, with the terminology of type I and type II coined to classify the three string theories known at the time.

==Type IIA string theory==
At low energies, type IIA string theory is described by type IIA supergravity in ten dimensions which is a non-chiral theory (i.e. left–right symmetric) with (1,1) &quot;d&quot;=10 supersymmetry; the fact that the anomalies in this theory cancel is therefore trivial.

In the 1990s it was realized by Edward Witten (building on previous insights by Michael Duff, Paul Townsend, and others) that the limit of type IIA string theory in which the string coupling goes to infinity becomes a new 11-dimensional theory called M-theory. Consequently the low energy type IIA supergravity theory can also be derived from the unique maximal supergravity theory in 11 dimensions (low energy version of M-theory) via a dimensional reduction.

The content of the massless sector of the theory (which is relevant in the low energy limit) is given by formula_2 representation of SO(8) where formula_3 is the irreducible vector representation, formula_4 and formula_5 are the irreducible representations with odd and even eigenvalues of the fermionic parity operator often called co-spinor and spinor representations. These three representations enjoy a triality symmetry which is evident from its Dynkin diagram. The four sectors of the massless spectrum after GSO projection and decomposition into irreducible representations are

formula_6

formula_7

formula_8

formula_9

where formula_10 and formula_11 stands for Ramond and Neveu–Schwarz sectors respectively. The numbers denote the dimension of the irreducible representation and equivalently the number of components of the corresponding fields. The various massless fields obtained are the graviton formula_12 with two superpartner gravitinos formula_13 which gives rise to local spacetime supersymmetry, a scalar dilaton formula_14 with two superpartner spinors—the dilatinos formula_15, a 2-form spin-2 gauge field formula_16 often called the Kalb–Ramond field, a 1-form formula_17 and a 3-form formula_18. Since the formula_19-form gauge fields naturally couple to extended objects with formula_20 dimensional world-volume, Type IIA string theory naturally incorporates various extended objects like D0, D2, D4 and D6 branes (using Hodge duality) among the D-branes (which are formula_10formula_10 charged) and F1 string and NS5 brane among other objects.

The mathematical treatment of type IIA string theory belongs to symplectic topology and algebraic geometry, particularly Gromov–Witten invariants.

==Type IIB string theory==
At low energies, type IIB string theory is described by type IIB supergravity in ten dimensions which is a chiral theory (left–right asymmetric) with (2,0) &quot;d&quot;=10 supersymmetry; the fact that the anomalies in this theory cancel is therefore nontrivial.

In the 1990s it was realized that type IIB string theory with the string coupling constant &quot;g&quot; is equivalent to the same theory with the coupling &quot;1/g&quot;. This equivalence is known as S-duality.

Orientifold of type IIB string theory leads to type I string theory.

The mathematical treatment of type IIB string theory belongs to algebraic geometry, specifically the deformation theory of complex structures originally studied by Kunihiko Kodaira and Donald C. Spencer.

In 1997 Juan Maldacena gave some arguments indicating that type IIB string theory is equivalent to N = 4 supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory in the &#x27;t Hooft limit; it was the first suggestion concerning the AdS/CFT correspondence.

==Relationship between the type II theories==
In the late 1980s, it was realized that type IIA string theory is related to type IIB string theory by T-duality.

<text>Woodlands is a suburb of Perth, Western Australia. Its local government area is the City of Stirling and it is in the federal Division of Curtin.

Many of the streets in Woodlands are named after trees, such as oak, elm, birch, sandalwood and willow.

==History==
Woodlands is part of the original Woodlands Estate owned by John Daniel Manning. Thomas William Mews was assigned a parcel of the land in 1831. Mews could not fulfil the required duties, and the grant passed to TRC Walters in 1840. It was later part of the land owned by Manning.

In 1842 the locality was named &quot;Jackadup&quot;, the Aboriginal name for the area. This was later adapted to &quot;Jackadder Lake&quot;, which is still the name of the lake in Woodlands.

Development in Woodlands started in the 1960s. The Floreat Lakes Estate to the south east was subdivided in 1991.

Woodlands is one of Perth&#x27;s original northern suburbs.

In 1964 Lake View Rd (now Huntriss Rd), saw housing development commence in Woodlands. At this time there were no house between it and Jackadder Lake. Jim Graham was the builder who made many of the original 1960s homes in this street on approximately a fifth of an acre blocks. Many of the homes were purchased for amounts between £3000 and £4000.

The area was surrounded by many bush land areas. Pearson St housed stables, a battery and market gardens. Floreat was the nearest developed suburb and locals tended to shop at Floreat Forum which was then home to the department store Moores. Churchlands was largely undeveloped except for the high school and Herdsman Lake was house free at this time, and remained so until the 1980s.

Woodlands for many years was in the Floreat electorate (now Churchlands), and Andrew Mensaros was the member for many years.

Woodlands Village provided essentials and was home to Freecorns, a butcher, a school uniform shop, and for a time a Shell petrol station.

In the 1970s Woodlands Primary School had a student body of over 700 pupils. There were approximately three classes in each year level from Grade 1 to 7; class sizes ranged generally from 30 to 36 students. Mr Larkin was principal for much of this period. Students walked to school and there was no traffic problems in the area at this time. The kindergarten was in Tamarisk Way with a walkway between houses from Castle Rd to Tamarisk Way. This was closed due to repeated noise complaints; the walkway land was offered for sale to the adjoining residents.

Liege St has seen many changes over the years, including the development of a putt putt course to a retirement village.

Around 1980 a man made island was formed in Jackadder Lake to provide a safe have for nesting wildlife. Many of the trees at the lake were planted by Woodlands Primary School students, who were made tree wardens.
==Schools==
Woodlands contains two primary schools:
* Woodlands Primary School, established in 1964 and located at 7 Bentwood Avenue
* Holy Rosary Catholic Primary School, established in 1959 and located at 35 Williamstown Road

==Community Development==
Woodlands is well serviced by parks and reserves. The most significant open space surrounds Jackadder Lake. Jackadder Lake was first recorded as &quot;Mews Lake&quot; in 1831 and provides a local recreation area.

There are several smaller parks in the locality, including Sweeting Reserve and Woodlands Reserve.

The neighbourhood retail area is called &quot;Woodlands Village&quot; and is located in the centre of the suburb. Ribbon development along Scarborough Beach Road in the north of Woodlands forms part of the Stirling Regional Centre and supplements local shopping.

The locality also contains a retirement village, while entertainment is provided by Event Cinemas on Liege Street.

<text>The Territory of Hawaii or Hawaii Territory (Hawaiian: &quot;Panalāʻau o Hawaiʻi&quot;) was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from April 30, 1900, until August 21, 1959, when most of its territory, excluding Palmyra Island, was admitted to the United States as the 50th US state, the State of Hawaii. The Hawaii Admission Act specified that the State of Hawaii would not include Palmyra Island, the Midway Islands, Kingman Reef, and Johnston Atoll, which includes Johnston (or Kalama) Island and Sand Island.

On July 4, 1898, the United States Congress passed the Newlands Resolution authorizing the US annexation of the Republic of Hawaii, and five weeks later, on August 12, Hawaii became a US territory. In April 1900, Congress approved the Hawaiian Organic Act which organized the territory. United States Public Law 103-150 adopted in 1993, (informally known as the Apology Resolution), acknowledged that &quot;the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii occurred with the active participation of agents and citizens of the United States&quot; and also &quot;that the Native Hawaiian people never directly relinquished to the United States their claims to their inherent sovereignty as a people over their national lands, either through the Kingdom of Hawaii or through a plebiscite or referendum&quot;. 

Hawaii&#x27;s territorial history includes a period from 1941 to 1944, during World War II, when the islands were placed under martial law. Civilian government was dissolved and a military governor was appointed.

==Background==
After the Overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom in January 1893, the Provisional Government of Hawaii set out to effect Hawaii&#x27;s speedy annexation by the United States. A commission, led by Lorrin A. Thurston, was sent to Washington, D.C. to negotiate an annexation treaty with US President Benjamin Harrison. A delegation led by Princess Victoria Kaiulani also went to Washington to protest the overthrow and to lobby against annexation.

Harrison and the commission signed a treaty of annexation, which was sent to the US Senate for ratification. However, the Senate did not act before March 4, 1893, when Harrison&#x27;s term ended and Grover Cleveland took office. The new president was an anti-imperialist and strongly opposed to annexation. He withdrew the treaty from consideration, and ordered a congressional investigation into the events surrounding the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy. After receiving the committee&#x27;s first report, Cleveland recommended the restoration of Queen Liliuokalani. This did not go over well even with his own party. Eventually a bipartisan congressional vote called for a &quot;hands off&quot; policy in regards to internal events in Hawaii. Further investigation by Congress led to the Morgan Report, which established that US troops in Hawaii had been completely neutral during the overthrow, and exonerated the US military from any accusations of complicity.

The Provisional Government convened a constitutional convention to establish the Republic of Hawaii. Thurston was urged to become the nation&#x27;s first president but he was worried his brazen personality would damage the cause of annexation. The more conservative Sanford B. Dole, former Supreme Court Justice and friend of Queen Liliuokalani, was elected as the first and only president of the new government.

During the Spanish–American War, Hawaii&#x27;s strategic location relative to the Philippines made it especially important to American interests, as argued by naval strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan. This and fears that the Empire of Japan would seize control of the islands provided momentum for the proponents of annexation. On July 4, 1898, the US Congress passed a joint resolution to provide for annexing of Hawaii to the United States. The resolution, commonly known as the Newlands Resolution (named after US Representative Francis G. Newlands), was signed into law three days later by President McKinley. The Newlands Resolution states:

The resolution took effect on August 12, 1898, and a formal ceremony marking the transfer of Hawaiian state sovereignty to the United States was held that day on the steps of the ʻIolani Palace in Honolulu. The Hawaiian flag was lowered and the American flag was raised in its place.

The Resolution also provided for the establishment of a five-member commission to study what new laws were needed regarding the management and disposition of public lands in Hawaii, and to develop a frame of government for the islands. Its members were Sanford B. Dole (who, under the terms of the Resolution, retained the powers he previously exercised as President of Hawaii), Walter F. Frear (who likewise remained Judge of the Supreme Court of Hawaii), US Senators Shelby M. Cullom (R-Illinois) and John T. Morgan (D-Alabama), and US Representative Robert R. Hitt (R-Illinois). The commission&#x27;s final report was submitted to Congress for a debate which lasted over a year. Many Southern Representatives and Senators raised objections to establishing an elected territorial government in Hawaii, as doing so would open a pathway for the admission of a state with a &quot;non-white&quot; majority population at a time when strict &quot;Jim Crow laws&quot; enforced white political control throughout the American South.

==Organic Act==
In early 1900, Congress passed an Act To provide a government for the Territory of Hawaii, which was signed into law by President William McKinley on April 30, 1900. This organic act established the office of governor of Hawaii. Territorial governors were appointed by the president of the United States with the advice and consent of the US Senate. They served for four years, unless removed sooner by the president.

===Territorial governors===

* Sanford B. Dole, Republican (1900–1903)
* George R. Carter, Republican (1903–1907)
* Walter F. Frear, Republican (1907–1913)
* Lucius E. Pinkham, Democrat (1913–1918)
* Charles J. McCarthy, Democrat (1918–1921)

* Samuel Wilder King, Republican (1953–1957)
* William F. Quinn, Republican (1957–1959)
===Legislature===
The Organic Act also created a bicameral Hawaii Territorial Legislature. It consisted of a lower chamber, the House of Representatives, and an upper chamber, the Senate. Its members were elected by popular vote.

===Judiciary===
The Act created the Territorial Supreme Court and additional appellate courts. All judges of these courts were appointed by the President with advice and consent of the Senate.

===Congressional delegate===
The Act also provided that Hawaii, like other US territories, would have a non-voting delegate to the US Congress.
* Robert William Wilcox (1900–1903)
* Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaole (1903–1922)
* Henry Alexander Baldwin (1922)
* William Paul Jarrett (1923–1927)

* Joseph Rider Farrington (1943–1954)
* Mary Elizabeth Pruett Farrington (1954–1957)
* John Anthony Burns (1957–1959)
==Tourism==
Hawaii&#x27;s tourism industry began in 1882 when Matson Navigation Company, founded by William Matson, began sailing vessels between San Francisco and Hawaii carrying goods. His transports encouraged him to purchase passenger steamships that would carry tourists hoping to vacation in Hawaii from the US mainland.

Matson&#x27;s fleet included the SS &quot;Wilhelmina&quot;, rivaling the best passenger ships serving traditional Atlantic routes. With the boom in interest of Hawaiian vacations by America&#x27;s wealthiest families in the late 1920s, Matson added the SS &quot;Mariposa&quot;, SS &quot;Monterey&quot; and SS &quot;Lurline&quot; (one of many Lurlines) to the fleet.

Matson Navigation Company operated two resort hotels in Honolulu near royal grounds. The first (and for a time the only) hotel on Waikīkī was the Moana Hotel which opened in 1901. As the first hotel in Waikīkī, the Moana Hotel was nicknamed the &quot;First Lady of Waikīkī.&quot; The hotel gained international attention in 1920 when Edward, Prince of Wales and future King Edward VIII of the United Kingdom, stayed as a guest.

In 1927, the luxurious Royal Hawaiian Hotel, informally called the &quot;Pink Palace of the Pacific&quot;, opened for business. It was the preferred Hawaii residence of President Franklin D. Roosevelt when he visited Hawaii during World War II.

==Military bases==
With annexation, the United States saw Hawaii as its most strategic military asset. McKinley and his successor US President Theodore Roosevelt expanded the military presence in Hawaii and established several key bases, some still in use today. By 1906, the entire island of Oahu was being fortified at the coastlines with the construction of a &quot;Ring of Steel,&quot; a series of gun batteries mounted on steel coastal walls. One of the few surviving batteries completed in 1911, Battery Randolph, is today the site of the U.S. Army Museum of Hawaii.

List of territorial installations:

* Camp McKinley (est. 1898)
* Fort Kamehameha (est. 1907)
* Pearl Harbor Naval Station (est. 1908)
* Fort Shafter (est. 1907)
* Fort Ruger (est. 1909)
* Schofield Barracks (est. 1909)
* Battery Closson (est. 1911)
* Battery Dudley (est. 1911)
* Battery Randolph (est. 1911)
* Fort DeRussy (est. 1915)
* Wheeler Army Airfield (est. 1922)
==Industrial boom and the &quot;Big Five&quot;==
As a territory of the United States, sugarcane plantations gained a new infusion of investment. By getting rid of tariffs imposed on sugarcane sent to the continental United States, planters had more money to spend on equipment, land and labor. Increased capital resulted in increased production. Five kingdom-era corporations benefited from annexation, becoming multimillion-dollar conglomerations: Castle &amp; Cooke, Alexander &amp; Baldwin, C. Brewer &amp; Co., Theo H. Davies &amp; Co., and American Factors (later Amfac). Together, the five companies dominated the Hawaiian economy as the &quot;Big Five.&quot;

==Pineapples and Hawaii==
James Dole, also known as the Pineapple King, arrived in Hawaii in 1899. He purchased land in Wahiawa and established the first pineapple plantation in Hawaii. Confident that canned pineapples could become a popular food export, Dole built a cannery near his first plantation in 1901. Hawaiian Pineapple Company, later renamed Dole Food Company, was born. With his profits soaring, Dole expanded and built a larger cannery in Iwilei near Honolulu Harbor in 1907. The Iwilei location made his main operations more accessible to labor. The cannery at Iwilei was in operation until 1991. Dole found himself in the midst of an economic boom industry. In response to growing pineapple demand in 1922, Dole purchased the entire island of Lanai and transformed the Hawaiian tropical low shrublands into the largest pineapple plantation in the world. For a long stretch of time, Lanai would produce 75% of the world&#x27;s pineapple and become immortalized as the &quot;Pineapple Island.&quot;

By the 1930s, Hawaii became the pineapple capital of the world and pineapple production became its second largest industry. After World War II, there were a total of eight pineapple companies in Hawaii. Today pineapples are imported from Thailand and elsewhere; few are commercially grown in Hawaii.

==Race relations==
One of the most prominent challenges territorial Hawaii had to face was race relations. Intermarriage was tolerated and even sought after. Many native women married immigrant men and joined their community. By 1898, most of Hawaii&#x27;s population was made up of plantation workers from China, Japan, the Philippines, and Portugal. Their plantation experiences molded Hawaii to become a plantation culture. The Hawaiian Pidgin language was developed on the plantations so they all could understand each other. Buddhism and Shintoism grew to become large religions. Catholicism became Hawaii&#x27;s largest Christian denomination.

===Massie Trial===
Race relations in Hawaii took to the national spotlight on September 12, 1931 when Thalia Massie, a US Navy officer&#x27;s wife, got drunk and alleged that she was beaten and raped. That same night, the Honolulu Police Department stopped a car and detained five men, all plantation workers. Officers took the men to Massie&#x27;s hospital bedroom where she identified them. Although evidence could not prove that the men were directly involved, national newspapers quickly ran stories about the brute locals on the prowl for white women in Hawaii. The jury in the initial trial failed to reach a verdict. One of the accused was afterwards severely beaten, while another, Joseph Kahahawai, was murdered. Police caught the Kahahawai killers: Massie&#x27;s husband Thomas, mother Grace Fortescue, and two sailors. Famed criminal lawyer Clarence Darrow defended them. A jury of locals found them guilty and sentenced to hard labor for ten years. Outraged by the court&#x27;s punishment, the territory&#x27;s white leaders as well as 103 members of Congress signed a letter threatening to impose martial law over the territory. This pressured Governor Lawrence M. Judd to commute the sentences to an hour each in his executive chambers. Hawaii residents were shocked and all of the United States reconsidered what they thought of Hawaii&#x27;s racial diversity. The term &quot;local&quot; (Hawaii&#x27;s non-Caucasian population) was galvanized through the Massie Trial

==Martial law==
From 1941 to 1944, following the attack on Pearl Harbor and America&#x27;s entry into World War II, Territorial Governors Joseph Poindexter and Ingram Stainback stripped themselves of their administrative powers by declaring martial law. With the territorial constitution suspended, the legislature and supreme court were also dissolved indefinitely. Military law was enforced on all residents of Hawaii. The formation of the military government was mostly done by Major General US Army Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps, who became military Attorney General. General Walter Short appointed himself military governor December 7, 1941. He assumed control of Hawaii and governed from ʻIolani Palace, which was quickly barricaded and fitted with trenches. He was relieved December 17 and charged with dereliction of duty, accused of making poor preparations in case of attack before the attack on Pearl Harbor.

Under martial law, every facet of Hawaiian life was under the control of the military governor. His government fingerprinted all residents over the age of six, imposed blackouts and curfews, rationed food and gasoline, censored the news and media, censored all mail, prohibited alcohol, assigned business hours, and administered traffic and special garbage collection. The military governor&#x27;s laws were called General Orders. Violations meant punishment without appeal by military tribunals.

Anthony, the shadow Attorney General of the period, provides different information. The &quot;aged and weak&quot; Poindexter (sic), an appointed Democrat, was variously misled into surrendering his powers. Anthony does not mention fingerprinting; corroborates gasoline rationing but not food (the latter unlike the mainland); and disproves a liquor ban by showing how the military gained handsome profits by liquor permits and fees.

The military government instituted employment stasis by General Order No. 91 (no leaving an employer without a letter of good standing); and the banning of courts that required witnesses and juries. Traffic violations were said to have netted prison terms and the military courts evidenced bias against civilians. There ensued a turf battle between the federal Departments of War, Justice and Interior, in which the middle one played a mediating or flip-flopping role. Indeed, it appeared War if not the Pacific Command was operating autonomously.

The Glockner and Seifert cases, actually two detained, naturalized Germans, tested the military&#x27;s suspension of habeas corpus. In the second year of martial law, August 1943, US District Judge Metzger subpoenaed General Richardson as to why these two were held without charges. The General, according to General Order No. 31, could have had the server arrested for bringing charges against a military person, but instead had the Marshal manhandled so as to evade summons. The prisoners were released outside of Hawaii, avoiding the implicated fall of military power.

List of military governors:
* Walter C. Short (1941)
* Delos C. Emmons (1941–1943)
* Robert C. Richardson Jr. (1943–1944)

==Democratic Revolution of 1954==
The Democratic Revolution of 1954 was a nonviolent revolution consisting of general strikes, protests, and other acts of civil disobedience. The Revolution culminated in the territorial elections of 1954 where the reign of the Hawaii Republican Party in the legislature came to an abrupt end, as they were voted out of office to be replaced by members of the Democratic Party of Hawaii.

==Hawaii 7==

During the years leading up to the ousting of the Republican Party, Cold War fears brewed and the U.S. was in the middle of the Second Red Scare. The FBI employed the Smith Act toward the ILWU and Communist Party of Hawaii, arresting those who would become known as the Hawaii 7 on August 28, 1951, in synchronized raids at 6:30 that morning. They were convicted in a two-year-long trial. The Hawaii 7 were eventually released in 1958:
* Jack Hall
* John Reinecke
* Koji Ariyoshi
* Jack Kimoto
* Jim Freeman
* Charles Fujimoto
* Eileen Fujimoto

==Statehood==
The first Congressional bill for Hawaii statehood was proposed in 1919 by Kuhio Kalanianaole, and was based upon the argument that World War I had proved Hawaii&#x27;s loyalty. It was ignored, and proposals for Hawaii statehood were forgotten during the 1920s because the archipelago&#x27;s rulers believed that sugar planters&#x27; interests would be better served if Hawaii remained a territory. Following the Jones–Costigan amendment, another statehood bill was introduced to the House in May 1935 by Samuel Wilder King but it did not come to be voted on, largely because FDR himself strongly opposed Hawaii statehood, while &quot;Solid South&quot; Democrats who could not accept non-white Congressmen controlled all the committees.

Hawaii resurrected the campaign in 1940 by placing the statehood question on the ballot. Two-thirds of the electorate in the territory voted in favor of joining the Union. After World War II, the call for statehood was repeated with even larger support, even from some mainland states. The reasons for the support of statehood were clear:
* Hawaii wanted the ability to elect its own governor
* Hawaii wanted the ability to elect the president
* Hawaii wanted an end to taxation without voting representation in Congress
* Hawaii suffered the first blow of the war
* Hawaii&#x27;s non-white ethnic populations, especially the Japanese, proved their loyalty by having served on the European frontlines
* Hawaii consisted of 90% United States citizens, most born within the U.S.

A former officer of the Honolulu Police Department, John A. Burns, was elected Hawaii&#x27;s delegate to Congress in 1956. A Democrat, Burns won without the white vote but rather with the overwhelming support of Japanese and Filipinos in Hawaii. His election proved pivotal to the statehood movement. Upon arriving in Washington, D.C., Burns began making key political maneuvers by winning over allies among Congressional leaders and state governors. Burns&#x27; most important accomplishment was convincing Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson (D-Texas) that Hawaii was ready to become a state, despite the continuing opposition of such Deep Southerners as James Eastland and John Sparkman.

In March 1959, both houses of Congress passed the Hawaii Admission Act and US President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed it into law. On June 27, 1959, a plebiscite was held asking Hawaii residents to vote on accepting the statehood bill. The plebiscite passed overwhelmingly, with 94.3% voting in favor. On August 21, church bells throughout Honolulu were rung upon the proclamation that Hawaii was finally a US state.

<doc id="672362" wikidata="Q3595255" url="?curid=672362" title="Madan Lal Khurana">
<text>Madan Lal Khurana (15 October 1936 – 27 October 2018) was an Indian politician who served as the 3rd Chief Minister of Delhi from 1993 to 1996. He was also the Governor of Rajasthan in 2004. Born in British India, Khurana was known as &quot;Dilli ka Sher&quot; in his party. He was the Union Minister of Parliamentary affairs and Tourism in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government. Khurana was a member of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Bharatiya Janata Party.

==Early life==
Khurana was born on 15 October 1936 in Lyallpur, Punjab Province (British India) (now called Faisalabad in Punjab, Pakistan) to S. D. Khurana and Laxmi Devi. Khurana was barely 12 when the family was forced to migrate to Delhi by India&#x27;s partition and began to piece its life together again at a refugee colony Kirti Nagar in New Delhi. He graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Kirori Mal College under Delhi University.

==Political career==

===As a student===
Khurana had his training in politics at Allahabad University, where he was doing his post-graduation in economics. He was general secretary of the Allahabad Students Union in 1959 and became general secretary of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad in 1960.

===Jan Sangh===
As a youth, Khurana became a teacher with Vijay Kumar Malhotra, at PGDAV (evening) College before deciding to enter politics. Madan Lal Khurana, Vijay Kumar Malhotra, Kedar Nath Sahani and Kanwar Lal Gupta founded the Delhi chapter of the Jan Sangh, which in 1980 transformed into BJP. Khurana was the Jan Sangh&#x27;s general secretary from 1965 to 1967. He dominated first Municipal Corporation politics and then the Metropolitan Council where he was the Chief Whip, Executive Councillor and Leader of the Opposition by turns.

===Rise in BJP===
BJP suffered badly in 1984 general elections, held after the death of Indira Gandhi. Khurana is credited with reviving the party in India&#x27;s capital, New Delhi. He worked tirelessly, which earned him the title of &#x27;Dilli Ka Sher&#x27; (Lion of Delhi).

He was the Chief Minister of Delhi from 1993 until he resigned in 1996. The party declined to reinstate him and preferred staying with Sahib Singh Verma.

He along with Kedar Nath Sahani and Vijay Kumar Malhotra kept the party afloat in New Delhi for more than four decades spanning from 1960 to 2000.

The peak of his career saw him serve as the Union Minister of Parliamentary Affairs and Tourism in the Vajpayee government, before resigning in January 1999, owing to a fallout with the senior leadership of the party following a series of attacks on Christians that were blamed on Hindu groups. He also served as the governor of Rajasthan from 14 January 2004 to 28 October 2004, when he resigned to return to politics in Delhi after about half a dozen MLAs from Delhi went up to him in Jaipur Raj Bhawan requesting that he return to active politics.

On 20 August 2005, Khurana was removed from the BJP for indiscipline for publicly criticising BJP president Lal Krishna Advani and expressing inability and discomfort at serving with him. On 12 September 2005, he was taken back to the party and given back his responsibilities after he apologised about his remarks about the party&#x27;s leadership.

On 19 March 2006, he was again expelled from the primary membership of the BJP for his anti-party statements. Khurana spoke against the party leadership when he announced that he would attend expelled Saffron Party leader Uma Bharti&#x27;s rally in Delhi. Khurana left the BJP, accusing it of not helping solve his cause as committed to giving weight to his mission of developing Delhi.

==Criticism==

In 1991, an arrest linked to militants in Kashmir led to a raid on hawala brokers, revealing evidence of large-scale payments to national politicians. Those accused included L. K. Advani, V. C. Shukla, P. Shiv Shankar, Sharad Yadav, Balram Jakhar, and Madan Lal Khurana. The prosecution that followed was partly prompted by a public interest petition (see Vineet Narain), and yet the court cases of the Hawala scandal eventually all collapsed without convictions. Many were acquitted in 1997 and 1998, partly because the hawala records (including diaries) were judged in court to be inadequate as the main evidence. The Central Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s role was criticised. In concluding the Vineet Narain case, the Supreme Court of India directed that the Central Vigilance Commission should be given a supervisory role over the CBI.

==Personal life==
Khurana was married to Raj Khurana. Together they had four children. One of his sons, Vimal, died in August 2018. Two months later, at 11 p.m. (IST) on 27 October 2018, Khurana died at his residence in Kirti Nagar, New Delhi, aged 82. He had a brain hemorrhage five years prior to his death and had been ailing since then.

<text>A bell barrow, sometimes referred to as a Wessex type barrow, campanulate form barrow, or a bermed barrow, is a type of tumulus identified as such by both John Aubrey and William Stukeley.

In the United Kingdom, they take the form of a circular mound or mounds within a circular ditch, the mounds being separated from the ditch and each other by a berm. There is sometimes present an additional bank, external to the ditch. The ditch is typically the source of the material used to create the mound and is therefore described as a &quot;quarry-ditch&quot;. A burial pit beneath the mound usually contains human remains, sometimes cremated, sometimes simply interred. Grave goods such as daggers or pottery vessels are commonly found within the burial pit also. An example at Sutton Veny included a bronze-age wooden coffin. The bell barrow in Milton Lilbourne in Wiltshire has no burial associated with it. Most bell barrows in the United Kingdom date to the early Bronze Age.

Leslie Grinsell constructed a typology for bell barrows:
* Type Ia: A single mound with a narrow berm
* Type Ib: A single mound with a normal berm
* Type Ic: A single mound with a wide berm
* Type II: Two mounds
* Type III: Three mounds
* Type IV: Four mounds

<text>A bowl barrow is a type of burial mound or tumulus. A barrow is a mound of earth used to cover a tomb. The bowl barrow gets its name from its resemblance to an upturned bowl. Related terms include &quot;cairn circle&quot;, &quot;cairn ring&quot;, &quot;howe&quot;, &quot;kerb cairn&quot;, &quot;tump&quot; and &quot;rotunda grave&quot;.

==Description==

Bowl barrows were created from the Neolithic through to the Bronze Age in Great Britain. A bowl barrow is an approximately hemispherical mound covering one or more Inhumations or cremations. Where the mound is composed entirely of stone, rather than earth, the term cairn replaces the word barrow. The mound may be simply a mass of earth or stone, or it may be structured by concentric rings of posts, low stone walls, or upright stone slabs. In addition, the mound may have a kerb of stones or wooden posts.

Barrows were usually built in isolation in various situations on plains, valleys and hill slopes, although the most popular sites were those on hilltops. Bowl barrows were first identified in Great Britain by John Thurnam (1810–73), an English psychiatrist, archaeologist, and ethnologist.

==British bowl barrows==

English Heritage proposed the following classification of British bowl barrows:
* Type 1: Kerbless and ditchless barrows
* Type 2: Kerbless with continuous ditch
* Type 3: Kerbless with penannular ditch
* Type 4: Kerbless with segmented ditch
* Type 5: Kerbed but ditchless
* Type 6: Kerbed with continuous ditch
* Type 7: Kerbed with pennanular ditch
* Type 8: Kerbed with segmented ditch
* Type 9: Structured but ditchless
* Type 10: Structured with continuous ditch
* Type 11: Structured with penannular ditch
* Type 12: Structured with segmented ditch

==Tump==

Tump is Worcestershire dialect term for a small hill, such as a barrow, even a large barrow such as the Whittington Tump in the village of Whittington south east of Worcester, or an &quot;unty tump&quot; meaning mole hill (unty being Worcestershire dialect for a mole). It is related to the Welsh language term &quot;Twmpath&quot; which was once applied to the mound or village green. From a short list of tumps, it can be seen that the term is used extensively in the Welsh Marches and its use extends beyond that, to Somerset, Wiltshire, Oxfordshire, and Buckinghamshire.

<text>Yokine is a suburb of Perth, Western Australia. Its local government area is the City of Stirling.

The area is also home to a number of key Jewish organisations, such as Carmel School, a Jewish Day School and JHub Maccabi Community Centre, a Jewish Community Centre. It is also situated close to Perth Hebrew Congregation in neighbouring Menora.

==History==
The name Yokine was derived from a Nyungar language word meaning &quot;dingo&quot; (which early settlers referred to as the &quot;native dog&quot;). The name was chosen because the area is close to Dog Swamp. Its post code is 6060.

Yokine was part of the grant originally allocated to T. R. C. Walters in 1840. Western Australian Golf Limited owned Yokine from at least 1927 and subdivided a small portion of land near the golf course. Before World War II the only house in Yokine was at the eastern end of Royal Street. Yokine experienced a housing boom after the war and much of the area near the golf course was developed by the early 1950s. The southern area grew rapidly in the 1960s and by the late 1970s Yokine was almost completely developed.

==Facilities==
Yokine is home to the Western Australian Golf Club, Yokine Bowling Club, Coolbinia-West Perth Cricket Club, Maccabi Soccer Club, Dianella Soccer Club, Coolbinia Amateur Football Club and the Coolbinia Bombers Junior Football Club. The Dianella Soccer Club, bowling, cricket and football clubs are located at Yokine Regional Open Space, a very large open space at the suburb&#x27;s southern border, comprising four large grassed areas and two children&#x27;s playgrounds. Pathways surrounding the reserve are used by walkers and runners, including a regular Parkrun group.

===Education===
Yokine Primary School was opened in 1959 on Woodrow Avenue in the centre of Yokine. Carmel School, a Jewish day school, operates both a primary and senior high school adjacent to the Yokine Primary School. Its primary school opened in Yokine in 1962, with the high school commencing in the 1970s.

===JHub Maccabi Community Centre===
JHub Maccabi Community Centre was first established on its present site on Woodrow Avenue in 1952. It serves as Jewish Community Centre to Perth and Western Australia&#x27;s Jewish communities. 

===Shopping===
Dog Swamp Shopping Centre

Dog Swamp Shopping Centre is a major shopping centre, located in Yokine.

The shopping centre was first opened in 1967. Prior to being taken over by the Westpac Diversified Property Trust, the centre was owned by the Foodland Associated Limited Property Trust.

Flinders Square Shopping Centre

Flinders Square Shopping Centre is a shopping centre located in Yokine, adjacent to Dog Swamp Shopping Centre. It was owned by Vicinity Centres, and was sold to Colliers International in 2018.

==Transport==
The suburb is served by a number of Transperth bus routes operated by Swan Transit and Path Transit. The 354, 370 (limited stop) and 970 (Mirrabooka-Yokine and Mirrabooka-Perth) covers Flinders Street, while the 384 (Mirrabooka-Perth), 385/386 (Marangaroo-Perth), 387 and 388 (Warwick-Perth) and the 389 (Wanneroo-Perth) cover Wanneroo Road, and route 19 covers the inner part of Yokine via Blythe Avenue.

<text>A bank barrow, sometimes referred to as a barrow-bank, ridge barrow, or ridge mound, is a type of tumulus first identified by O.G.S. Crawford in 1938.

In the United Kingdom, these take the form of a long, sinuous, parallel-sided mound, approximately uniform in height and width along its length, and usually flanked by ditches on either side. They may be the result of a single phase of construction, or be the result of the addition of one or more linear extensions to the bank of a pre-existing barrow. Although burials have been found within the mound, no burial chambers as such have been identified in bank barrows. These ancient monuments are of middle Neolithic date.


Fewer than ten bank barrows remain in the United Kingdom. Examples may be found at
* Maiden Castle, Broadmayne and Martin&#x27;s Down in Dorset; and
* Long Low near Wetton in Staffordshire.

<doc id="672373" wikidata="Q6610706" url="?curid=672373" title="List of colleges in Ontario">
<text>Colleges in Ontario may refer to several types of educational institutions. College in Canada most commonly refers to a career-oriented post-secondary institution that provides vocational training or education in applied arts, applied technology and applied science. Most post-secondary colleges in Ontario typically offer certificate and diploma programs. 

There are 24 publicly funded colleges in Ontario. Most are designated as a &quot;College of Applied Arts and Technology&quot; (CAAT), although five are designated as a &quot;Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning&quot; (ITAL). In addition to certificates, apprenticeship, and diplomas, several public colleges have also received ministerial consent from the province&#x27;s Ministry of Colleges and Universities to award degrees. While any public college in Ontario may receive ministerial consent to offer degrees, degree programs at CAATs may only constitute 5 per cent of the institution&#x27;s programming, while ITALs are capped at up to 15 per cent.

In addition to publicly funded colleges, the province has also authorized the establishment of over 500 privately operated career colleges that provide certificate and diploma programs.

The Canadian Armed Forces also operate several institutions in Ontario that also bear the name &quot;college&quot;. However, one of these institutions is considered a university with full degree-granting authority, while the others are considered staff colleges that provide professional development courses for officers of the Canadian Armed Forces.

==Public colleges==
The modern college system in Ontario which focuses on vocational training was established through Bill Davis&#x27; Bill-153 on May 21, 1965. This legislation aimed to establish a distinct post-secondary educational system separate from universities. All 24 publicly funded colleges in Ontario were established through the &quot;Ontario Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology Act, 1965&quot;, which outlined that these institutions were to provide &quot;career-oriented, post-secondary education and training to assist individuals in finding and keeping employment, to meet the needs of employers and the changing work environment and to support the economic and social development of their local and diverse communities.&quot; These CAATs represented a consolidation of the province&#x27;s earlier vocational and career-oriented postsecondary institutions formed in the 1940s to 1965, including institutes of technology, institutes of trades, and vocational centres.

Public colleges in Ontario historically only provided certificate, apprenticeship, and diploma programs, and did not offer degree programs, as the province had one of the most stringent regulations in North America in restricting degree-granting authority solely to universities. In 2000, the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities authorized colleges to offer a limited number of applied baccalaureate degrees under the &quot;Postsecondary Education Choice and Excellence Act, 2000&quot;. However, in contrast to public universities, which possess full degree-granting authority through legislation, public colleges in Ontario can only offer specific degrees after receiving ministerial consent from the provincial government. 

In 2003, the province introduced a new designation, &quot;Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning,&quot; to denote publicly funded colleges where up to 15 per cent of its programs awarded degrees, while colleges that retained the &quot;College of Applied Arts and Technology&quot; title were limited at 5 per cent. In 2012–2013 approximately 74 degree programs were offered by 12 Ontario colleges.

The Ontario Public Service Employees Union represents faculty and support staff working in Ontario&#x27;s publicly funded colleges, though certain classes of faculty and support staff are not covered. These are divided into three bargaining units: academic, full-time support, and part-time support.

===List of public colleges===
There are 24 publicly funded colleges in Ontario. Most operate as a &quot;College of Applied Arts and Technology&quot;, although five are designated as an &quot;Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning&quot;.

English is the language of instruction for the majority of programs at publicly funded colleges in Ontario, although some programs are taught in French. There are 22 publicly funded colleges operating as English-language institutions and two as French-language institutions.

The following is a list of publicly funded colleges in Ontario:
==Private colleges==
Ontario has over 500 career colleges (formerly known as private career colleges) that confer certificate and diplomas. These colleges are regulated by the &quot;Ontario Career Colleges Act, 2005&quot;. These are privately operated institutions which must be registered and approved by the provincial Superintendent of Career Colleges.

== Military institutions ==
The names of several military institutions based in Ontario include the word &quot;college&quot;, and are all operated by the Canadian Armed Forces.

The Royal Military College of Canada is a military university based in Kingston, and offers undergraduate and graduate education for officers-in-training. Although the institution includes the word &quot;college&quot; in its name, the Royal Military College of Canada is recognized as a university with full degree-granting authority.

The Canadian Armed Forces also operates several staff colleges in Ontario, including the Canadian Forces College in Toronto and the Canadian Army Command and Staff College in Kingston. These institutions provides professional development programs for military officers in the Canadian Armed Forces.

<text>The Association of Chess Professionals (ACP) is a non-profit organisation which aims to protect the rights of professional chess players, address their concerns and to promote chess worldwide through the organisation of high level chess tournaments and maintaining a ranking system of the top professionals.

Besides these activities, the ACP encourages and promotes the civil engagement of chess players into the decision-making processes of FIDE, the world chess body. This was particularly evident with the formation of the joint ACP-FIDE panel Anti Cheating Committee (renamed to Fair Play Commission in 2018).

In 2014 the ACP announced the initiation of the Veteran&#x27;s Programme along with FIDE, which seeks to provide a stipend to a few deserving veteran players who could benefit from such support. – since then 18 veterans were awarded with an annual stipend.

At the summer of 2015 the ACP united about 1100 chess professionals (International Masters, Grand Masters, International Arbiters and Organisers) from 85 countries. Most of the world&#x27;s top players, including the previous World Champion Vishwanathan Anand can be found among the ACP members.

==ACP Board==

It consists of ACP President Aleksandar Colovic, ACP Board Director and Deputy President Yuri Garrett, ACP General Secretary Beatriz Marinello, ACP Treasurer Laurent Freyd, ACP Tour Director Pavel Tregubov and Board Members Jesús García Valer, Aleksandra Dimitrijevic, Gunnar Bjornsson, Iván Salgado López, Sergei Beshukov and Maria Emelianova.

The ACP Board coordinates all activities of the ACP. The main activities are the following:
*Organization of the high-level chess events
*Consultations of the ACP members on topical issues
*Veteran&#x27;s support and anti-cheating programs
*Development of recommendations for FIDE, national federations and other members of the chess society on the actual problems
*Dialogue with the members through the ACP Newsletter as well as open dialogue on internet
*Conduction of opinion polls – the ACP is the only organization in the chess world that develops and conducts polls on a regular basis
*ACP Tour – the permanent up-to-date calculation of the player&#x27;s performance throughout the year, with the winners receiving wild cards to the most prestigious tournaments worldwide
*The ACP Board is an international team of [chess] professionals united by the main aims of the organization: to protect the rights of all the actors in the chess society as well as to promote the game of chess worldwide. All members of the ACP have the right to be elected as well as to vote for the candidates of the ACP Board. The ACP Board coordinates all the activities of the ACP on a voluntary basis.
*Members of the Board are in constant contact with each other using all possible means of communications. About once a month there is a common gathering of the board members, when issues are discussed live (over a conference call or, if possible, in person).
*For decision-making within the Board, all proposals are voted upon by each member. For most decisions a majority is sufficient, but the most critical ones require the support of 2/3rd of the Board.

==ACP Tour and Tournaments==
The ACP Tour is the unique system that unites about 100 high-level chess tournaments in 25 countries. Best players of the ACP Tour qualify to participate in the annual ACP Cup – one of the most prestigious events of the global chess calendar. The idea and points system of the ACP Tour was envisioned by Pavel Tregubov, who managed the technical details from 2004 to 2006. During 2007–2011 the ACP Tour was managed by Yannick Pelletier. Finally, from 2012, Tregubov once again took the role of the ACP Tour Coordinator.

Based on the rankings of the ACP Tour, the top performing players in the ACP Tour received wildcards to important international events. Maxime Vachier-Lagrave went on to reach the semi-finals in the 2013 World Cup, after qualifying due to his results on the tour. Dozens of other grandmasters have received wildcards for prestigious tournaments like Tata Steel Chess and Poikovsky.

During the period of 2012–2015, the ACP organised seven world-class tournaments with the participation of world&#x27;s best players: The ACP Golden Classic 2014 in Bergamo, Italy, the ACP Women Cup in Tbilisi, the Women&#x27;s World Rapid and Blitz Championship in Batumi, the ACP Golden Classic in Amsterdam (2012), the ACP Cup in Riga (2013) and European – ACP Women&#x27;s Rapid Championship in Kutaisi (2015). More than 150 players have participated in these events where prizes over US$750,000 were at stake.

==History==
The organisation was founded in June 2003, the catalyst for its foundation being disagreement with the European Chess Union and professional players during 2003 European Individual Chess Championship in Turkey. The first players meeting organised during that event by three GMs Almira Skripchenko, Pavel Tregubov and Igor Glek was followed by the formation of an initiative group headed by the same players.

The first ACP Board started its work in 2004 with the following people: the ACP&#x27;s President French Grandmaster Joël Lautier, secretary Bartłomiej Macieja, Treasurer Almira Skripchenko, Deputy Treasurer Pavel Tregubov, Board members Igor Glek, Anna Hahn, Vladimir Kramnik, Peter Heine Nielsen and Yannick Pelletier. First members of the ACP were such prominent players as Viswanathan Anand, Péter Lékó, and Judit Polgár, but not Garry Kasparov.

The organisation was founded in 2003, the catalyst for its foundation being disagreement with the European Chess Union over the choice of hotel that all participants in the 2003 European Individual Chess Championship were required to stay in. It has since been involved in a number of matters relating to professional play.

The organisation has been compared by some to the Professional Chess Association, the body established by Garry Kasparov and Nigel Short as an organisation under which to play their 1993 World Championship having broken away from FIDE, the official governing body of chess. However, unlike the PCA, which was in competition with FIDE over the running of the world championship, the ACP initially stated that they &quot;hope to work together with FIDE, as well as other international and national chess bodies&quot; . In March 2005, however, Lautier commented that &quot;at present FIDE avoids any contact with us, does not respond to our mails, and we don&#x27;t expect any positive changes of the situation.&quot; 

The ACP has been extremely critical of FIDE on a number of issues, including its selection of Libya as the site for the 2004 Championships (thus putting the ability of Israeli players to take part under question) and aspects relating to the contracts with players in that championship.

As well as these political activities, the ACP has organised a number of online chess tournaments (open only to its members) on the Playchess server (run by Chessbase). On 31 July 2004, at a press conference held during the Dortmund tournament, Lautier announced plans for the inaugural ACP tour in which the eight ACP members who perform best in tournaments over the course of a year (as determined by a points scoring system) will play in a final event (the ACP Masters) to determine the best player of the season .

Recently, there has been contact and co-operation between ACP and FIDE, and many ACP suggestions have been approved by FIDE to improve the conditions of the players. Also some ACP officials have been involved in FIDE anti cheating committees. Due to this increased influence, ACP has managed to push through many important changes in the FIDE regulations, raising the prize funds and improving the financial conditions of the professional chess players.

In July 2023, the ACP announced its dissolution due to declining membership and funds.

==ACP development==

As the first act of his presidency in December 2011 Emil Sutovsky outlined the basis of his programme, which will be centered around the fostering of the interest of chess professionals.

There are four main guidelines:
*the development of a think tank for promoting professional chess and organizing top-level events
*the renewal of the communication strategy of the ACP, with special attention being paid to the mainstream and new media
*working with corporate sponsors based on the transparency and time-effective decision process of the ACP
*the increase in membership and representativeness

<text>Isaac Tichenor (February 8, 1754December 11, 1838) was an American lawyer and politician. He served as the third and fifth governor of Vermont and United States Senator from Vermont.

==Biography==
Tichenor was born in Newark in the Province of New Jersey, the son of Susanna (Guerin) and Daniel Tichenor. He graduated from Princeton University in 1775 and moved for a short while to Schenectady, New York where he studied law. He was a descendant of Martin Tichenor (1625–1681), an early colonist and original settler of Newark, New Jersey.

==Career==
In 1777, Tichenor moved to Bennington, Vermont and served as an Assistant Commissary General during the American Revolution. He was elected captain and commander of a Bennington militia company, which was activated for service several times in Vermont and upstate New York. He was also appointed a justice of the peace.

He was a member of the Vermont House of Representatives from 1781 to 1784 and served as Speaker of the House in 1783. He was an agent from the Vermont Republic to the Continental Congress, and presented Vermont&#x27;s request for admission to the Union from 1782 to 1789.

After Vermont&#x27;s admission to the Union in 1791, Tichenor ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the United States House of Representatives against Matthew Lyon and Israel Smith, receiving 29% of the vote in the first round. He ran for governor in three consecutive elections in 1793, 1794, and 1795, losing each time to Thomas Chittenden. He was an associate justice of the Vermont Supreme Court from 1791 to 1794, and Chief Justice in 1795 and 1796.

Tichenor was also active in the Vermont militia, and attained the rank of major general as commander of its 2nd Division.

In 1796 he was elected to fill the unexpired term of Moses Robinson in the United States Senate beginning on October 18, 1796. He was re-elected to a full six-year term to begin on March 4, 1797, but he resigned on October 17, 1797, when he was elected Governor of Vermont.

Tichenor was a member of the Federalist Party; when that party dominated the federal government in the 1790s many leading politicians in Vermont joined the Democratic-Republican Party and opposed a strong federal government at the national level. Despite dominating the Governor&#x27;s office for a decade, Tichenor&#x27;s elections reflected the decline of the Federalist Party as a whole, as he won by increasingly narrow margins. After his last consecutive victory in 1806, he lost in 1807, won narrowly won 1808, and lost in 1809, 1810, and 1817 by increasing margins.

In 1815, Tichenor returned to the United States Senate, where he served until 1821. By the end of his term the Federalist Party had ceased to exist.

==Death==
After completing his Senate term, Tichenor lived in retirement in Bennington. He died in Bennington on December 11, 1838, and was interred at Bennington Village Cemetery. He was the last surviving Governor to have served in the 18th century.

<doc id="672389" wikidata="Q448136" url="?curid=672389" title="Marjapussi">
<text>Marjapussi is a traditional Finnish trick taking game for 4 players playing in 2 partnerships and is one of the Mariage family, its key feature being that the trump suit is determined in the middle of the play by declaring a marriage (a king and a queen of a same suit). There are variants of marjapussi for two and three players.

== Origin ==
&quot;Marjapussi&quot; is Finnish for &#x27;bag of berries&#x27;, but is derived from the French &quot;mariage&quot; which is the name of the game ancestral to it in which a &#x27;marriage&#x27; is a king/queen combination held by one of the players. According to Kokko, the game was originally Spanish, although Mariage itself, despite its French name, appears to be a 17th-century German game.
Later, marjapussi evolved into huutopussi (&quot;auction bag&quot;), which involves bidding and contracts. The exact winning condition was dropped, but the trump determining process remained. In fact, in huutopussi the trump suit may even change in the middle of the play if players declare further marriages.

== Rules ==
Marjapussi is a trick taking game for four players in fixed partnerships with the partners sitting opposite one another.

=== Cards ===
Marjapussi is played with a pack of 36 French-suited Finnish pattern cards. This may be replicated by removing the 2s, 3s, 4s, and 5s from a standard 52-card pack. Cards rank in the usual ace–ten order: A &gt; 10 &gt; K &gt; Q &gt; J &gt; 9 &gt; 8 &gt; 7 &gt; 6. The aces and tens are called &#x27;checkmaters&#x27; (&quot;mateiksi&quot;) and play a key role in scoring points. 

=== Deal ===
The first dealer may be chosen by any method. After the first deal, the player who was forehand in the previous hand deals. The dealer gives an equal number of cards to each player.

=== Play ===
In the first deal, forehand, the player who leads to the first trick, is either the one who has the A or is the player to the left of the dealer. 

Forehand leads to the first trick and then, clockwise and in turn, each player plays a card to the table. A trick is formed when each player has played one card on the table. Players must follow suit if possible. Once a trump is determined, players who cannot follow, must play a trump if able. Players must always head the trick if possible, even if their partner has played the best card so far. The trick is taken by the person who played the highest trump or by the highest card of the led suit if no trumps are played and that person leads to the next trick. The tricks are collected face down in front of the player separately from the cards in the hand. The game continues until everyone runs out of cards and points are counted. After this, a new deal is started.

=== Marriages and trumps ===
A deal always starts as a no trump game, but a suit can be declared trumps during a hand. A player who has won a trick may declare trumps if a &#x27;marriage&#x27;, i.e. king and a queen of the same suit, is held. There are three options:

* A player with a marriage in hand may declare that suit as trumps.
* A player may ask if the partner has a &#x27;whole&#x27; i.e. a marriage in hand by saying e.g. &quot;do you have a whole marriage?&quot; If yes, that suit becomes trumps. The asker may not nominate a suit when asking.
* A player with a king or a queen in hand may ask if the partner has &quot;a half&quot; of that suit, that is the other card of the pair in his hand by saying e.g. &quot;do you have a half-marriage in spades?&quot; If yes, that suit becomes trumps. The asker specifies the suit, but not the denomination.

After each trick, the winner of the trick is entitled to one of the actions mentioned above. Once trumps have been declared: 

* The trump suit may not be changed by further marriage declarations.
* The declaring team may subsequently ask for half-marriages but not whole ones.
* Players may declare &#x27;little ones&#x27; or &#x27;little trumps&#x27;, i.e. other marriages in a similar fashion, but they only affect scoring and do not change the trump suit. 

Each suit can be declared only once during a hand.

===Scoring===

Game points are scored as follows:
* Trump (&quot;Valtti&quot;): 2 points for declaring trumps.
* Litte Trump (&quot;Pikkuvaltti&quot;) 1 point for each &#x27;little marriage&#x27;
* Last (&quot;Viimeinen&quot;): 1 point for winning the last trick
* Victory (&quot;Voitto&quot;): 1 point for the team that has more card points in tricks (see table)

The card points are counted after all cards have been played. Game is 10 or 12 game points. To win, a team must score exactly 12. If they get more, they go back down to 7 game points. If a team takes no tricks in a deal, they lose all their points so far. This is sometimes called &#x27;going to Porvoo&#x27;.

== Avomarjapussi ==
This two-handed variant of marjapussi is known as avomarjapussi (&quot;open marjapussi&quot;). Each player is dealt four hand cards, followed by a row of seven downcards on the table and a row of seven upcards on the top of the downcards. To declare marriages and play cards to tricks, the players can use both their own upcards and hand cards. When a player plays an upcard to a trick and there is a downcard beneath it, the latter is turned face up.

Other rules are the same as the four-handed game, except that there are no partnerships, and consequently the rules on asking a partner for a whole or a half do not apply.

== Related games ==
A very similar game evidently related to Sixty-six, but with a curious resonance of All Fours is played in Sweden under the name Bondtolva (&quot;Farmer&#x27;s Dozen&quot;).

<doc id="672390" wikidata="Q131069" url="?curid=672390" title="Caudipteryx">
<text>Caudipteryx (meaning &quot;tail feather&quot;) is a genus of small oviraptorosaur dinosaurs that lived in Asia during the Early Cretaceous, around 124.6 million years ago. They were feathered and extremely birdlike in their overall appearance, to the point that some paleontologists suggested it was a bird. Two species have been described: &quot;C. zoui&quot; (the type species), in 1998, and &quot;C. dongi&quot;, in 2000.

It had a stout trunk, long legs and was probably a swift runner. The discovery of &quot;Caudipteryx&quot; has led to many intensive studies and debate over the relationship of birds and dinosaurs.

==History==

In 1997, several well-preserved dinosaur skeletons were recovered from the Jiulongsong Member of the Chaomidianzi Formation (now Jianshangou Bed of the Yixian Formation), at the Sihetun locality of Liaoning province, China. The fossils were later described in 1998 and used as the type specimens for the new dinosaur taxa &quot;Caudipteryx&quot; and &quot;Protarchaeopteryx&quot;. &quot;Caudipteryx&quot; was erected with the type species &quot;C. zoui&quot; and the holotype is NGMC 97-4-A, a nearly complete individual preserving conspicuous feather impressions and gastroliths. The paratype is NGMC 97-9-A, another relatively complete individual with feather impressions. The generic name, &quot;Caudipteryx&quot;, means &quot;tail feather&quot;, and the specific name, &quot;zoui&quot;, is in honor of Zou Jiahua for his prominent support to the scientific community as the vice premier of China.

Around the summer of 1988, a partially complete skeleton of &quot;Caudipteryx&quot; lacking the skull was found in sediments of the &quot;Layer 6&quot; of the Yixian Formation, at the Zhangjiagou locality, which is set apart from Sihetun. This specimen, IVPP V 12344, was in 2000 described and designed as the holotype for new species &quot;Caudipteryx dongi&quot;, and in a similar fashion to previous specimens of the genus, it preserves exquisite traces of feather integument. The specific name &quot;dongi&quot; honors Zhiming Dong, a Chinese paleontologist.

===Additional specimens===

During 2000, Zhong-He Zhou and colleagues described two additional specimens of &quot;Caudipteryx&quot;, BPM 0001 and IVPP V 12430, referred to &quot;C. zoui&quot; and &quot;C.&quot; sp. respectively. Both individuals preserve nearly complete skulls and have feather impressions. Further analyses to IVPP V 12430 have revealed the preservation of propatagium on its left arm.

In 2021 Xiaoting Zheng and team described STM4-3 representing an articulated individual lacking the skull and tail tip, including abundant integument, gastroliths, but also a cartilage fragment that was reported to preserve chondrocytes. The specimen was collected from outcrops of the Yixian Formation at Dapingfang Town near Chaoyang city, west Liaoning.

==Description==
===Size===
&quot;Caudipteryx&quot; was a small theropod, measuring long and weighing about based on femur length. Like many other maniraptorans, has a mix of reptile- and bird-like anatomical features.

===Skull===
It had a short, boxy skull with a beak-like snout that retained only a few tapered teeth in the front of the upper jaw.

===Postcranial skeleton===
Its short tail was stiffened toward the tip, with few vertebrae, like in birds and other oviraptorosaurs. It has a primitive pelvis and shoulder, and primitive skull details in the quadratojugal, squamosal, quadrate, jugal, and mandibular fenestra (in the cheek, jaw, and jaw joint). It has a hand skeleton with a reduced third finger, like that of early birds and the oviraptorid &quot;Heyuannia&quot;.

&quot;Caudipteryx&quot; had uncinate processes on the ribs, birdlike teeth, a first toe which may or may not be partially reversed and overall body proportions that are comparable to those of modern flightless birds.

===Feathers===

The hands of &quot;Caudipteryx&quot; supported symmetrical, pennaceous feathers that had vanes and barbs, measuring between long. The primary feathers were arranged in a wing-like fan along the second finger, just like primary feathers of birds and other maniraptorans. An additional fan of feathers existed on its tail. The body of &quot;C. zoui&quot; was covered in black feathers, with a visible banding pattern preserved on tail feathers.

A study on the number of flight feathers has concluded that &quot;Caudipteryx&quot; was secondarily flightless.

==Classification==
The consensus view, based on several cladistic analyses, is that &quot;Caudipteryx&quot; is a basal (primitive) member of the Oviraptorosauria, and the oviraptorosaurians are non-avian theropod dinosaurs. &quot;Incisivosaurus&quot; is the only oviraptorosaur that is more primitive.

Halszka Osmólska &quot;et al.&quot; (2004) ran a cladistic analysis that came to a different conclusion. They found that the most birdlike features of oviraptorids actually place the whole clade within Aves itself, meaning that &quot;Caudipteryx&quot; is both an oviraptorid and a bird. In their analysis, birds evolved from more primitive theropods, and one lineage of birds became flightless, re-evolved some primitive features, and gave rise to the oviraptorids. This analysis was persuasive enough to be included in paleontological textbooks like Benton&#x27;s &quot;Vertebrate Paleontology&quot; (2005).
The view that &quot;Caudipteryx&quot; was secondarily flightless is also preferred by Gregory S. Paul, Lü &quot;et al.&quot;, and Maryańska &quot;et al.&quot;

Others, such as Stephen Czerkas and Larry Martin have concluded that &quot;Caudipteryx&quot; is not a theropod dinosaur at all. They believe that &quot;Caudipteryx&quot;, like all maniraptorans, is a flightless bird, and that birds evolved from non-dinosaurian archosaurs.

A weighted cladogram from 2014, using TNT, is shown below.

===Relationship with birds===
Because &quot;Caudipteryx&quot; has clear and unambiguously pennaceous feathers, like modern birds, and because several cladistic analyses have consistently recovered it as a non-avian oviraptorid dinosaur, it provided, at the time of its description, the clearest and most succinct evidence that birds evolved from dinosaurs. Lawrence Witmer stated:
“The presence of unambiguous feathers in an unambiguously non-avian theropod has the rhetorical impact of an atomic bomb, rendering any doubt about the theropod relationships of birds ludicrous.”

However, not all scientists agreed that &quot;Caudipteryx&quot; was unambiguously non-avian, and some of them continued to doubt that general consensus. Paleornithologist Alan Feduccia sees &quot;Caudipteryx&quot; as a flightless bird evolving from earlier archosaurian dinosaurs rather than from late theropods. Jones &quot;et al.&quot; (2000) found that &quot;Caudipteryx&quot; was a bird based on a mathematical comparison of the body proportions of flightless birds and non-avian theropods. Dyke and Norell (2005) criticized this result for flaws in their mathematical methods, and produced results of their own which supported the opposite conclusion. Other researchers not normally involved in the debate over bird origins, such as Zhou, acknowledged that the true affinities of &quot;Caudipteryx&quot; were debatable.

==Paleobiology==
===Diet===
&quot;Caudipteryx&quot; is thought to have been an omnivore. In at least two specimens of &quot;Caudipteryx&quot; (NGMC 97 4 A and NGMC 97 9 A), gastroliths are preserved. As in some herbivorous dinosaurs, the avialan &quot;Sapeornis&quot;, and modern birds, these gastroliths remain in the position where the animals&#x27; gizzards would have been.

==Paleoenvironment==
All &quot;Caudipteryx&quot; fossils were recovered from the Yixian Formation in Liaoning, China. Specifically, they come from a small area of the Jianshangou bed, near the town of Zhangjiakou. They appear to have been fairly common, though isolated to this small region. The specific region in which &quot;Caudipteryx&quot; lived was home to the other feathered dinosaurs &quot;Dilong&quot; and &quot;Sinornithosaurus&quot;.

<doc id="672391" wikidata="Q628491" url="?curid=672391" title="Teatro di San Carlo">
<text>The Real Teatro di San Carlo (&quot;Royal Theatre of Saint Charles&quot;), as originally named by the Bourbon monarchy but today known simply as the Teatro (di) San Carlo, is a historic opera house in Naples, Italy, connected to the Royal Palace and adjacent to the Piazza del Plebiscito. It is the oldest continuously active venue for opera in the world, having opened in 1737, decades before either Milan&#x27;s La Scala or Venice&#x27;s La Fenice.

The opera season runs from late November to July, with the ballet season from December to early June. The house once had a seating capacity of 3,285, but has now been reduced to 1,386 seats. Given its size, structure and antiquity, it was the model for theatres that were later built in Europe.

==History of the opera house==
The Real Teatro di San Carlo was commissioned by the Bourbon King Charles VII of Naples (&quot;Carlo VII&quot; in Italian), who wanted to endow Naples with a new and larger theatre to replace the old, dilapidated, and too-small Teatro San Bartolomeo of 1621, which had served the city well, especially after Scarlatti had moved there in 1682 and had begun to create an important opera centre which existed well into the 18th century.

Thus, the San Carlo was inaugurated on 4 November 1737, the king&#x27;s name day, with the performance of the opera Domenico Sarro&#x27;s &quot;Achille in Sciro&quot;, based on the 1736 libretto by Metastasio which had been set to music that year by Antonio Caldara. As was customary, the role of Achilles was played by a woman, Vittoria Tesi, called &quot;Moretta&quot;; the opera also featured soprano Anna Peruzzi, called &quot;the Parrucchierina&quot; and tenor Angelo Amorevoli. Sarro also conducted the orchestra in two ballets as intermezzi, created by Gaetano Grossatesta, with scenes designed by Pietro Righini. The first seasons highlighted the royal preference for dance numbers, and featured among the performers famous castrati.

In the late 18th century, Christoph Willibald Gluck was called to Naples by the impresario Tufarelli to direct his 1752 &quot;Clemenza di Tito&quot; at the theatre, and Johann Christian Bach in 1761-62 brought two operas, &quot;Catone in Utica&quot; and &quot;Alessandro nell&#x27;Indie&quot;.

===1737: Construction of the &quot;Teatro di San Carlo (San Carlo Theater)&quot;===

The &quot;Teatro di San Carlo&quot; (San Carlo Theater) was designed by Giovanni Antonio de Medrano, a Sicilian nobleman, royal architect and chief engineer of the kingdom, who also served as &quot;Major Regius Praefectus Mathematicis Regni Neapolitani&quot; (Major Royal Governor of Mathematics of the Kingdom of Naples) and was a teacher of Charles III of Spain. Angelo Carasale, the former director of the San Bartolomeo, was primarily responsible for designing the elaborate furnishings of the Teatro di San Carlo. The horseshoe-shaped auditorium is the oldest in the world. It was built for 75,000 ducats. The hall was 28.6 meters long and 22.5 meters wide, with 184 boxes, including those of proscenium, arranged in six orders, plus a royal box capable of accommodating ten people, for a total of 1,379 seats. Including a standing room, the theatre could hold over 3,000 people. The fastidious composer and violinist Louis Spohr reviewed the size and acoustic properties of this opera house very thoroughly on 15 February 1817 and concluded that:

Much admired for its architecture, its gold decorations, and the sumptuous blue upholstery (blue and gold being the official colours of the Bourbons), the San Carlo was now the biggest opera house in the world. Concerning the power of the existing Bourbon Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, Beauvert notes that the design of the house, with its 184 boxes lacking any curtains was so that &quot;no one could avoid the scrutiny by the sovereign&quot; who had his private access from the Royal Palace.

In 1809, Domenico Barbaia was appointed manager of the royal opera houses in Naples and remained in charge until 1841. He soon established a reputation for innovative and dazzling productions, attracting the public and leading singers to the opera house.

===February 1816 to January 1817: Destruction by fire and rebuilding===

On 13 February 1816, a fire broke out during a dress rehearsal for a ballet performance and quickly spread to destroy a part of the building.

On the orders of King Ferdinand IV, another Bourbon monarch and son of Charles VII, who used the services of Antonio Niccolini, Barbaia was able to rebuild the opera house within ten months. It was rebuilt as a traditional horseshoe-shaped auditorium with 1,444 seats and
a proscenium, 33.5m wide and 30m high. The stage was 34.5m deep. Niccolini embellished in the inner of the bas-relief depicting &quot;Time and the Hour&quot;. 
The central frescoed ceiling painting of &quot;Apollo presenting to Minerva the greatest poets of the world&quot; was painted by Antonio, Giuseppe e Giovanni Cammarano.

On 12 January 1817, the rebuilt theatre was inaugurated with Johann Simon Mayr&#x27;s &quot;Il sogno di Partenope&quot;. Stendhal attended the second night of the inauguration and wrote: &quot;There is nothing in all Europe, I won&#x27;t say comparable to this theatre, but which gives the slightest idea of what it is like..., it dazzles the eyes, it enraptures the soul...&quot;.

In 1844, the opera house was re-decorated under Niccolini, his son Fausto, and Francesco Maria dei Giudice. The main result was the change in appearance of the interior to the now-traditional red and gold.

===Late 19th century, post World War II, and 21st century renovations===
Apart from the creation of the orchestra pit, suggested by Verdi in 1872, the installation of electricity in 1890, the subsequent abolition of the central chandelier, and the construction of the new foyer and a new wing for dressing rooms, the theatre underwent no substantial changes until the repair of the bombing damage in 1943.

During World War II, the opera house was damaged by bombs. Following the liberation of Naples in October 1943, Peter Francis of the Royal Artillery organized repairs to the damaged foyer and, three weeks later, reopened the building with a musical revue. With the building in a fit state for performances, more musicians and singers made themselves available, and the first opera performance was held on 26 December 1943, a matinee presentation of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot;. Francis stayed on for another two years, producing 30 operas. On 9 July 1946, the American baritone Lawrence Tibbett sang the title role in Rigoletto before an audience that included senior military figures of the Mediterranean Theater of Operations and troops of the Allied Forces.

By the start of the twenty-first century, the opera house was showing its age with outmoded stage machinery, inadequate visitor facilities, and lack of air conditioning. In response, the Campania regional government funded a €67 million renovation over six months in 2008 and six months in 2009, including restoration of the décor and the creation of a new rehearsal hall. As noted in &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine, the opera house reopened on 27 January 2010 with Mozart&#x27;s &quot;La Clemenza di Tito&quot;, the 254th anniversary of the composer&#x27;s birth: &quot;The renovation work was completed last year under the direction of architect Elisabetta Fabbri and is intended to return Teatro San Carlo to its condition following Antonio Niccolini&#x27;s rebuilding after the fire of 1816. The project...involved 300 workers day and night.&quot;

==The great age of Neapolitan opera==


At the time, Neapolitan School of opera enjoyed great success all over Europe, not only in the field of opera buffa but also in that of opera seria. The Neapolitan school of opera composers included Feo, Porpora, Leo, Traetta, Piccinni, Vinci, Anfossi, Durante, Jommelli, Cimarosa, Paisiello, Zingarelli, and Gazzaniga. Naples became the capital of European music, and even foreign composers considered the performance of their compositions at the San Carlo theatre to be the goal of their careers. These composers included Hasse (who later settled in Naples) Haydn, Johann Christian Bach and Gluck.

Similarly, the most prominent singers performed and consolidated their fame at the San Carlo. These included Lucrezia Anguiari, called &quot;La Cocchetta&quot;, the renowned castrati Giovanni Manzuoli, Caffarelli (Gaetano Majorano), Farinelli (Carlo Broschi), Gizziello (Gioacchino Conti) and Gian Battista Velluti, the last castrato. Caffarelli, Farinelli, and Gizziello were products of the local conservatories of Naples.

===Composers in residence===
From 1815 to 1822, Gioachino Rossini was house composer and artistic director of the royal opera houses, including the San Carlo. During this period he wrote ten operas which were &quot;Elisabetta, regina d&#x27;Inghilterra&quot; (1815), &quot;La gazzetta&quot;, &quot;Otello, ossia il Moro di Venezia&quot; (1816), &quot;Armida&quot; (1817), &quot;Mosè in Egitto&quot;, &quot;Ricciardo e Zoraide&quot; (1818), &quot;Ermione&quot;, &quot;Bianca e Falliero&quot;, &quot;Eduardo e Cristina&quot;, &quot;La donna del lago&quot; (1819), &quot;Maometto II&quot; (1820), and &quot;Zelmira&quot; (1822).

Regular singers of the period included Manuel Garcia and his daughter Maria Malibran, Clorinda Corradi, Giuditta Pasta, Isabella Colbran, Giovanni Battista Rubini, Domenico Donzelli and the two great French rivals Adolphe Nourrit and Gilbert Duprez—the inventor of the C from the chest.

After composing &quot;Zelmira&quot;, Rossini left Naples with Colbran, who had previously been the lover of Domenico Barbaia. The couple were married shortly thereafter.

To replace Rossini, Barbaja first signed up Giovanni Pacini and then another rising star of Italian opera, Gaetano Donizetti. As artistic director of the royal opera houses, Donizetti remained in Naples from 1822 until 1838, composing sixteen operas for the theatre, among which &quot;Maria Stuarda&quot; (1834), &quot;Roberto Devereux&quot; (1837), &quot;Poliuto&quot; (1838) and the famous &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; (1835), written for soprano Tacchinardi-Persiani and tenor Duprez.

Vincenzo Bellini, Sicilian by birth, also staged his first work, &quot;Bianca e Fernando&quot;, at the San Carlo.

Giuseppe Verdi was also associated with the theatre. In 1841, his &quot;Oberto Conte di San Bonifacio&quot; was performed there, and in 1845 he wrote his first opera for the theatre, &quot;Alzira&quot;; a second, &quot;Luisa Miller&quot;, followed in 1849. His third should have been &quot;Gustavo III&quot;, but the censor made such significant changes that it was never performed in that version nor under that title (until a re-created version was given in 2004). It was later performed in Rome with significant revisions to the plot and its location, while the title became &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;.

Among the conductors and composers appointed by the Teatro San Carlo was the famous and eccentric French harpist and composer Nicolas-Charles Bochsa, who was accompanied by his lover, the English prima donna Anna Bishop, with whom he was touring the world. He conducted several operas (1844–1845) in the San Carlo with Anna Bishop as prima donna. She sang there 327 times in 24 operas.

==Decline and revival by late 19th century==
The unification of Italy in 1861 led to Naples losing its status as the musical center of Italy and the home of the country&#x27;s leading opera house, La Scala, as power and wealth moved northwards. By 1874, the fall in performance income led to the opera house&#x27;s closing for a year. Its fortunes were able to recover due to the continued support in the latter half of the nineteenth century and into the twentieth century by Giacomo Puccini and other composers of verismo operas, such as Pietro Mascagni, Leoncavallo, Giordano, and Cilea, who staged their works here.

In the late nineteenth century, the house created its own in-house orchestra under Giuseppe Martucci, which helped attract several respected conductors, including Arturo Toscanini, Pietro Mascagni, and composer Richard Strauss, whose influence expanded the opera house&#x27;s repertoire.

One performer who did not appear in Naples from 1901 onward was Naples-born Enrico Caruso, who, after being booed by a section of the audience during a performance of &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot;, vowed never to return.

<doc id="672395" wikidata="Q876308" url="?curid=672395" title="Southern Province, Sri Lanka">
<text>The Southern Province ( &quot;Dakuṇu Paḷāta&quot;, &quot;Theṉ Mākāṇam&quot;) of Sri Lanka is one of the nine provinces of Sri Lanka, the first level administrative division of the country. The provinces have existed since the 19th century but did not have any legal status until 1987 when the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka established provincial councils. It is the 7th largest province by area and is home to 2.5 million people, the 3rd most populated province. The province is bordered by Sabaragamuwa Province and Uva Province to the North, Eastern Province to the Northeast, Western Province to the Northwest and the Indian Ocean to the South, West and East. The Province&#x27;s capital is Galle.

The Southern Province is a geographic area consisting of the districts of Galle, Matara and Hambantota. Subsistence farming and fishing is the main source of income for the vast majority of the people of this region. Government School education is primarily handled by the Southern Provincial Education Department.

==Administrative divisions==
Southern Province is divided into 3 districts and 47 divisional secretariats.

===Divisional Secretariats===
The districts of the Sri Lanka are divided into administrative sub-units known as divisional secretariats. These were originally based on the feudal counties, the s and s. They were formerly known as &#x27;D.R.O. Divisions&#x27; after the &#x27;Divisional Revenue Officer&#x27;. Later the D.R.O.s became &#x27;Assistant Government Agents&#x27; and the divisions were known as &#x27;A.G.A. Divisions&#x27;. Currently, the divisions are administered by a &#x27;Divisional Secretary&#x27;, and are known as a &#x27;D.S. Divisions&#x27;.

There are 47 divisional secretariats in the Southern Province, with 19 in Galle District, 12 in Hambantota District and 16 in Matara District.

===Major population centres===


==Landmarks==
Important landmarks of the Southern Province include the wildlife sanctuaries of the Yala and Udawalawe National Parks. Ussangoda in Ambalantota is a panoramic view of the beach and the sea, and the holy city of Kataragama, and the ancient cities of Tissamaharama, Kirinda and Galle. (Although Galle is an ancient city, almost nothing survives from before the Portuguese invasion.) During the Portuguese period there were two famous Sinhalese poets called Andare who was from Dickwella and Gajaman Nona who was from Denipitiya in Matara District, composing poems on common man.

The Southern Province was seriously affected by the tsunami in 2004. The province is going through a rebuilding process.

<doc id="672399" wikidata="Q9300216" url="?curid=672399" title="Portuguese phonology">
<text>The phonology of Portuguese varies among dialects, in extreme cases leading to some difficulties in mutual intelligibility. This article on phonology focuses on the pronunciations that are generally regarded as standard. Since Portuguese is a pluricentric language, and differences between European Portuguese (EP), Brazilian Portuguese (BP), and Angolan Portuguese (AP) can be considerable, varieties are distinguished whenever necessary.

==Consonants==
The consonant inventory of Portuguese is fairly conservative. The medieval Galician-Portuguese system of seven sibilants (, , , and apicoalveolar ) is still distinguished in spelling (intervocalic &quot;c/ç z, x g/j, ch, ss -s-&quot; respectively), but is reduced to the four fricatives by the merger of into and apicoalveolar into either or (depending on dialect and syllable position), except in parts of northern Portugal (most notably in the Trás-os-Montes region). These changes are known as deaffrication. Other than this, there have been no other significant changes to the consonant phonemes since Old Portuguese. However, several consonant phonemes have special allophones at syllable boundaries (often varying quite significantly between European and Brazilian Portuguese), and a few also undergo allophonic changes at word boundaries.

Phonetic notes
* Semivowels contrast with unstressed high vowels in verbal conjugation, as in &quot;(eu) rio&quot; &#x27;I laugh&#x27; and &quot;(ele) riu&quot; &#x27;he (has) laughed.&#x27; Phonologists debate whether their nature is vocalic or consonantal. In intervocalic position semivowels are ambisyllabic, they are associated to both the previous syllable and the following syllable onset.
* In Brazil and Angola, the consonant hereafter denoted as is realized as a nasal palatal approximant , which nasalizes the vowel that precedes it: &quot;ninho&quot; ( in Brazil, in Angola) &#x27;nest&#x27;.
* is often the pronunciation of a sequence of followed by in a rising diphthong in Brazil, forming a minimal pair between &quot;sonha&quot; and &quot;Sônia&quot; ; &quot;menina&quot;, &quot;girl&quot; .
* is often the pronunciation of a sequence of followed by in a rising diphthong in Brazil; e.g. &quot;limão&quot;, &quot;lemon&quot; ; &quot;sandália&quot;, &quot;sandal&quot; .
* The consonant hereafter denoted as has a variety of realizations depending on dialect. In Europe, it is typically a voiced uvular fricative . There is also a realization as a voiceless uvular fricative , and the original pronunciation as an alveolar trill also remains very common in various dialects. A common realization of the word-initial in the Lisbon accent is a voiced uvular fricative trill . In Brazil, can be velar, uvular, or glottal and may be voiceless unless between voiced sounds; it is usually pronounced as a voiceless velar fricative , a voiceless glottal fricative or voiceless uvular fricative . See also &quot;Guttural R in Portuguese&quot;. All those variants are transcribed with in this article.
* and are normally , as in English. However, a number of dialects in northern Portugal pronounce and as apico-alveolar sibilants which are exactly the same as the ones found in Catalan and Northern European Spanish. Those apico-alveolars sound like duller versions of and , but they are kept apart from (written &quot;ch/x&quot; and &quot;j/g&quot;) which are laminal postalveolar. A small number of northeastern Portugal dialects still retain the medieval distinction between apical and laminal sibilants (written &quot;s/ss&quot; and &quot;c/ç/z&quot;, respectively), a distinction also found in Mirandese and analogous to the &quot;distinción&quot; of European Spanish.
* As phonemes, and occur only in loanwords (e.g. &quot;tchau&quot; and &quot;dee jay&quot;), with a tendency for speakers to substitute into fricatives in Portugal. However, in most Brazilian dialects &quot;d&quot; and &quot;t&quot; are pronounced as and before and .
* In northern and central Portugal, the voiced stops , , are usually lenited to fricatives , , and respectively, except at the beginning of words, or after nasal vowels; a similar process occurs in Spanish.
* In large parts of northern Portugal, e.g. Trás-os-Montes, and also in East Timor and the islands of Flores, and are merged, both pronounced , as in Spanish.

===Consonant elision===
There is a variation in the pronunciation of the first consonant of certain clusters, most commonly C or P in &quot;cç&quot;, &quot;ct&quot;, &quot;pç&quot; and &quot;pt&quot;. These consonants may be variably elided or conserved. For some words, this variation may exist inside a country, sometimes in all of them; for others, the variation is dialectal, with the consonant being always pronounced in one country and always elided in the other. This variation affects 0.5% of the language&#x27;s vocabulary, or 575 words out of 110,000. In most cases, Brazilians variably conserve the consonant while speakers elsewhere have invariably ceased to pronounce it (for example, &quot;detector&quot; in Brazil versus &quot;detetor&quot; in Portugal). The inverse situation is rarer, occurring in words such as &quot;fa(c)to&quot; and &quot;conta(c)to&quot; (consonants never pronounced in Brazil, pronounced elsewhere). Until 2009, this reality could not be apprehended from the spelling: while Brazilians did not write consonants that were no longer pronounced, the spelling of the other countries retained them in many words as silent letters, usually when there was still a vestige of their presence in the pronunciation of the preceding vowel. This could give the false impression that European Portuguese was phonologically more conservative in this aspect, when in fact it was Brazilian Portuguese that retained more consonants in pronunciation.

=== Consonant phonotactics ===
Syllables have the maximal structure of (C)(C)V(C). The only possible codas in European Portuguese are , and and in Brazilian Portuguese and (or, in a minority of dialects, or any combination of the former with the latter).

* The consonants and almost always occur in the middle of a word and between vowels and rarely occur before .

* Although nasal consonants do not normally occur at the end of syllables, syllable-final may be present in rare learned words, such as &quot;abdómen&quot; ( &#x27;abdomen&#x27;). In Brazilian varieties, these words have a nasal diphthong (, spelled as &quot;abdômen&quot;). Word-initial occurs in very few loanwords.
* While the sibilant consonants () contrast word-initially and intervocalically, they appear in complementary distribution in the syllable coda. For many dialects (i.e., those of Portugal and of Rio de Janeiro and the northeast of Brazil and certain other areas in Brazil), the sibilant is a postalveolar in coda position (e.g., &quot;pasto&quot; &#x27;pasture&#x27;; &quot;futurismo&quot; &#x27;futurism&#x27;; &quot;paz&quot; &#x27;peace&#x27;). In many other dialects of Brazil (e.g., some of the Southeast, Northeast, and North), the postalveolar variant occurs in some or all cases when directly preceding a consonant, including across word boundaries, but not word-finally (e.g., , , ). In a number of Brazilian dialects, this &quot;palatalization&quot; is absent entirely (e.g., , , ). Voicing contrast is also neutralized, with or occurring before voiced consonants and or appearing before voiceless consonants and before a pause (e.g., &quot;pasta&quot; or , &#x27;paste&#x27;; &quot;Islão&quot; (or &quot;Islã&quot;) or , &#x27;Islam&#x27;). In the vast majority of dialects, however, word-final &quot;s&quot; and &quot;z&quot; are pronounced /z/ before vowels (e.g. &quot;os ovos&quot; , &quot;the eggs&quot;, &quot;temos hoje&quot; , &quot;we have today&quot;, &quot;faz isso&quot; , &quot;do that&quot;). In European dialects, the postalveolar fricatives are only weakly fricated in the syllable coda.
*The consonant is velarized in all positions in European Portuguese, even before front vowels. In Portugal, the unvelarized lateral appears only in non-standard dialects. In most Brazilian dialects, is vocalized to at the end of syllables, but in the dialects of the extreme south, mainly along the frontiers with other countries (especially Uruguay), it has the full pronunciation or the velarized pronunciation. In some &quot;caipira&quot; registers, there is a rhotacism of coda to retroflex . In casual BP, unstressed &quot;il&quot; can be realized as , as in &quot;fácil&quot; (&#x27;easy&#x27;).
*For speakers who realize as an alveolar trill , the sequence (as in e.g., &quot;os rins&quot;) can coalesce into a voiced alveolar fricative trill .
*Regarding Brazilian Portuguese, analyzes the phonetic clusters at the start of words like &quot;qual&quot; and &quot;guardar&quot; as separate phonemes, and , rather than as or followed by in phonemic sequence. This is because when or is combined with a different approximant or when is combined with a different initial consonant, the relevant approximant can always be alternatively realized as a full vowel in Brazilian Portuguese: &quot;quiabo&quot; , &quot;guiar&quot; , &quot;suar&quot; . However, this alternation can never apply to the phonetic clusters and : &quot;qual&quot; and &quot;guardar&quot; in Brazilian Portuguese are always and , never * or *.
*The semivowels and do not occur before and respectively, and only contrast in some diphthongs like in &quot;pai&quot; versus &quot;pau&quot; . Otherwise they are the non-syllabic allophones of and in unstressed syllables.
*Unlike its neighbor and relative Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese lacks a tendency to elide any stop, including those that may become a continuant by lenition ( &gt; , &gt; , &gt; ), but it has a number of allophones to it.

===Rhotics===
The occurrence of the two rhotic phonemes and is mostly predictable by context, with dialectal variations in realization.

The rhotic is predicted to be hard in the following circumstances:

* Syllable-initially when not following an oral vowel (e.g., &quot;rosa&quot; &#x27;rose&#x27;, &quot;guelra&quot; &#x27;gill&#x27;, &quot;Israel&quot;)
* Following a nasal vowel (e.g., &quot;honrar&quot; &#x27;to honor&#x27;)
* Syllable-finally, in most Brazilian and some African dialects 

The rhotic is predicted to be &quot;soft&quot; (i.e., ) when it occurs in syllable onset clusters (e.g., &quot;atributo&quot;) or, in some dialects, syllable-finally.

The rhotic phonemes and contrast only between an oral vowel and a vowel, similar to Spanish. In this context, they are spelled &quot;rr&quot; and &quot;r&quot;, respectively.

This restricted variation has prompted several authors to postulate a single rhotic phoneme. and see the soft as the unmarked realization and that instances of intervocalic result from gemination and a subsequent deletion rule (i.e., &quot;carro&quot; &gt; &gt; ). Conversely, argue that the hard is the unmarked realization.

====Brazilian rhotics====
In addition to the phonemic variation between and between vowels, up to four allophones of the &quot;merged&quot; phoneme /R/ are found in other positions:
#A &quot;soft&quot; allophone in syllable-onset clusters, as described above;
#A default &quot;hard&quot; allophone in most other circumstances;
#In some dialects, a special allophone syllable-finally (i.e., preceded but not followed by a vowel);
#Commonly in all dialects, deletion of the rhotic word-finally.

The default hard allophone is some sort of voiceless fricative in most dialects, e.g., , although other variants are also found. For example, an alveolar trill is found in certain conservative dialects down São Paulo, of Italian-speaking, Spanish-speaking, Arabic-speaking, or Slavic-speaking influence. A uvular trill is found in areas of German-speaking, French-speaking, and Portuguese-descended influence throughout coastal Brazil down Espírito Santo, most prominently Rio de Janeiro.

The syllable-final allophone shows the greatest variation:
*Many dialects (mainly in Brasília, Minas Gerais and Brazilian North and Northeast) use the same voiceless fricative as in the default allophone. This may become voiced before a voiced consonant, esp. in its weaker variants (e.g., &quot;dormir&quot; &#x27;to sleep&#x27;).
*The soft occurs for many speakers in Southern Brazil and São Paulo city.
*An English-like approximant or vowel (R-colored vowel) occurs elsewhere in São Paulo as well as Mato Grosso do Sul, southern Goiás, central and southern Mato Grosso and bordering regions of Minas Gerais, as well as in the urban areas in the Sinos river valley. This pronunciation is stereotypically associated with the rural &quot;caipira&quot; dialect.

Throughout Brazil, deletion of the word-final rhotic is common, regardless of the &quot;normal&quot; pronunciation of the syllable-final allophone. This pronunciation is particularly common in lower registers, although found in most registers in some areas, e.g., Northeast Brazil, and in the more formal and standard sociolect. It occurs especially in verbs, which always end in R in their infinitive form; in words other than verbs, the deletion is rarer and seems not to occur in monosyllabic non-verb words, such as &quot;mar&quot;. Evidence of this allophone is often encountered in writing that attempts to approximate the speech of communities with this pronunciation, e.g., the rhymes in the popular poetry (cordel literature) of the Northeast and phonetic spellings (e.g., &quot;amá, sofrê&quot; in place of &quot;amar, sofrer&quot;) in Jorge Amado&#x27;s novels (set in the Northeast) and Gianfrancesco Guarnieri&#x27;s play &quot;Eles não usam black tie&quot; (about favela dwellers in Rio de Janeiro).

The soft realization is often maintained across word boundaries in close syntactic contexts (e.g., &quot;mar azul&quot; &#x27;blue sea&#x27;).

==Vowels==
Portuguese has one of the richest vowel phonologies of all Romance languages, having both oral and nasal vowels, diphthongs, and triphthongs. A phonemic distinction is made between close-mid vowels and the open-mid vowels , as in Italian, Catalan and French, though there is a certain amount of vowel alternation. European Portuguese has also two central vowels, one of which tends to be elided like the &quot;e caduc&quot; of French.

The central closed vowel only occurs in European Portuguese when &quot;e&quot; is unstressed, e.g. &quot;presidente&quot; , as well as in Angola; where unlike Portugal, it only occurs in final syllables, e.g. &quot;presidente&quot; . However, does not exist in Brazil, e.g. &quot;presidente&quot; .

In Angola, and merge to , and appears only in final syllables &quot;rama&quot; . The nasal becomes open .

=== Vowel classification ===
In some cases, Portuguese uses vowel height to contrast stressed syllables with unstressed syllables:
* In Portugal, unstressed tend to be raised to , whereas remain unchanged. In final syllables, only appear.
* In the Southern, Central-West and Southeast regions of Brazil, unstressed are raised to , whereas in Northern and Northeast regions, they remain open. However, stressed remain unchanged throughout the whole territory. In final syllables, only appear.
* In Angola, unstressed remain unchanged. In final syllables, only appear.

See below for details. The dialects of Portugal are characterized by reducing vowels to a greater extent than others. Falling diphthongs are composed of a vowel followed by one of the high vowels or ; although rising diphthongs occur in the language as well, they can be interpreted as hiatuses.

European Portuguese possesses quite a wide range of vowel allophones:
* All vowels are lowered and retracted before : .
* All vowels are raised and advanced before alveolar, palato-alveolar and palatal consonants: . Those are the vowels shown on the chart. The diphthong is an exception to that as it is often pronounced in Lisbon, with a back onset.

Furthermore, Cruz-Ferreira gives voiceless allophones of , , in the unstressed word-final position.

The exact realization of the varies somewhat amongst dialects. In Brazil, the vowel can be as high as in any environment. It is typically closer in stressed syllables before intervocalic nasals than word-finally, reaching as open a position as in the latter case, and open-mid before nasals, where can be nasalized. In European Portuguese, the general situation is similar, except that in some regions the two vowels form minimal pairs in some European dialects. In central European Portuguese this contrast occurs in a limited morphological context, namely in verb conjugation between the first person plural present and past perfect indicative forms of verbs such as &quot;pensamos&quot; (&#x27;we think&#x27;) and &quot;pensámos&quot; (&#x27;we thought&#x27;; spelled in Brazil). Spahr proposes that it is a kind of crasis rather than phonemic distinction of and . It means that in &quot;falamos&quot; &#x27;we speak&#x27; there is the expected prenasal -raising: , while in &quot;falámos&quot; &#x27;we spoke&#x27; there are phonologically two in crasis: (however, in Brazil both merge, &quot;falamos&quot; . In Angola, on the other hand, both merge as well, but spelling keeps differentiated: &quot;falamos/falámos&quot; ). Close-mid vowels and open-mid vowels ( and ) contrast only when they are stressed. In unstressed syllables, they occur in complementary distribution. In Brazilian Portuguese, they are raised to close after a stressed syllable, or in some accents and in general casual speech, also before it.

According to Mateus and d&#x27;Andrade (2000:19), in European Portuguese, the stressed only occurs in the following three contexts:
* Before a palatal consonant (such as &quot;telha&quot; )
* Before the palatal front glide (such as &quot;lei&quot; )
* Before a nasal consonant (such as &quot;cama&quot; )

English loanwords containing stressed or are usually associated with pre-nasal as in &quot;rush&quot;, or are influenced by orthography as in &quot;clube&quot; (club), or both, as in &quot;surf/surfe&quot;.

=== European Portuguese &quot;e caduc&quot; ===
European Portuguese possesses a near-close near-back unrounded vowel, transcribed in this article. It occurs in unstressed syllables such as in &quot;pegar&quot; (&#x27;to grip&#x27;).

*Traditionally, all instances of are pronounced; e.g. verdade , perigo&quot; , estado&quot; .
*In modern European Portuguese, the initial is fronted to ; e.g. &quot;energia&quot; → .
*In traditional EP, was never retracted to . In modern EP, it happens when it is surrounded by , so that ministro&quot; , &quot;príncipe and &quot;artilhar&quot; are usually pronounced , and .
*When &quot;e&quot; is surrounded by another vowel, it becomes ; e.g. real .
*However, when the &quot;e caduc&quot; is preceded by a semi-vowel, it may be given the unreduced pronunciation of the letter , that is or : poesia&quot; , quietude&quot; .
* Regardless of the underlying phoneme, a phonetic can be elided, affecting syllabification and sometimes even producing a syllabic consonant; e.g. verdade → , perigo&quot; → , estado&quot; → , &quot;energia&quot; → , ministro&quot; → , &quot;príncipe → , &quot;artilhar&quot; → , &quot;caminhar&quot; → , &quot;pistola&quot; → (here, stands for a syllabic alveolar trill with one contact, the syllabic counterpart of ). This can result in complex syllable onsets that are typical of Slavic languages.
* Whenever is elided, obstruents in the resulting consonant cluster often agree in voicing, so that the most reduced form of &quot;desistiu&quot; &#x27;(he) gave up&#x27; surfaces as . , a phonological sonorant, behaves like an obstruent in this case and can also be devoiced in voiceless clusters, as in &quot;reconhecer&quot; &#x27;to recognize&#x27; (phonemically ).

There are very few minimal pairs for this sound, including &quot;pregar&quot; (&#x27;to nail&#x27;) vs. &quot;pregar&quot; (&#x27;to preach&#x27;; the latter stemming from earlier &quot;preegar&quot; &lt; Latin &quot;praedicāre&quot;) as well as &quot;jure&quot; (&#x27;I swear&#x27;, subjunctive) vs. &quot;júri&quot; (&#x27;jury&#x27;).

===Oral diphthongs===
Diphthongs are not considered independent phonemes in Portuguese, but knowing them can help with spelling and pronunciation.

There are also some words with two vowels occurring next to each other like in &quot;iate&quot; and &quot;sábio&quot; may be pronounced both as rising diphthongs or hiatus. In these and other cases, other diphthongs, diphthong-hiatus or hiatus-diphthong combinations might exist depending on speaker, such as or even for &quot;suo&quot; (&#x27;I sweat&#x27;), and in BP or even for &quot;fatie&quot; (&#x27;slice it&#x27;).

 and are non-syllabic counterparts of the vowels and , respectively. At least in European Portuguese, the diphthongs tend to have more central second elements (as stated above, the starting point of is typically back) – note that is also more weakly rounded than the monophthong.

===Nasal vowels===
Portuguese also has a series of nasalized vowels. analyzes European Portuguese with five monophthongs and five diphthongs, all phonemic: . Nasal diphthongs occur mostly at the end of words (or followed by a final sibilant), and in a few compounds.

As in French, the nasal consonants represented by the letters ⟨m n⟩ are deleted in coda position, and in that case the preceding vowel becomes phonemically nasal, e.g. in &quot;genro&quot; (&#x27;son-in-law&#x27;). But a nasal consonant subsists when it is followed by a plosive, e.g. in &quot;cantar&quot; (&#x27;to sing&#x27;). Vowel nasalization has also been observed non-phonemically as result of coarticulation, before heterosyllabic nasal consonants, e.g. in &quot;soma&quot; (&#x27;sum&#x27;). Hence, there is a difference between phonemic nasal vowels and those that are allophonically nasalized. Additionally, a nasal monophthong written ⟨ã⟩ exists independently of these processes, e.g. in &quot;romã&quot; (&#x27;pomegranate&#x27;). Brazilian Portuguese is seen as being more nasal than European Portuguese due to the presence of these nasalized vowels. Some linguists consider them to be a result of external influences, including the common language spoken at Brazil&#x27;s coast at time of the European arrival, Tupi.

The and distinction does not happen in nasal vowels; ⟨em om⟩ are pronounced as close-mid. In BP, the vowel (which the letter ⟨a⟩ otherwise represents) is sometimes phonemically raised to when it is nasal, and also in stressed syllables before heterosyllabic nasal consonants (even if the speaker does not nasalize vowels in this position): compare for instance &quot;dama sã&quot; (PT) or (BR) (&#x27;healthy lady&#x27;) and &quot;dá maçã&quot; (PT) or (BR) (&#x27;it gives apples&#x27;). may also be raised slightly in word-final unstressed syllables.

Nasalization and height increase noticeably with time during the production of a single nasal vowel in BP in those cases that are written with nasal consonants ⟨m n⟩, so that may be realized as or . This creates a significant difference between the realizations of ⟨am⟩ and ⟨ã⟩ for some speakers: compare for instance &quot;ranço real&quot; (PT) or (BR) (&#x27;royal rancidness&#x27;) and &quot;rã surreal&quot; (PT) or (BR) (&#x27;surreal frog&#x27;). (Here means a velar nasal approximant.) At the end of a word ⟨em⟩ is always pronounced with a clear nasal palatal approximant (see below). Whenever a nasal vowel is pronounced with a nasal coda (approximant or occlusive) the (phonetic) nasalization of the vowel itself is optional.

The following examples exhaustively demonstrate the general situation for BP.
* &quot;romã&quot; (&#x27;pomegranate&#x27;) : : final vowel is (phonemically) &quot;nasal&quot; and nasal approximants may not be pronounced.
* &quot;genro&quot; (&#x27;son-in-law&#x27;) : or or : nasal consonant deleted; preceding vowel is (phonemically) &quot;nasal&quot; and nasal approximants may be pronounced.
* &quot;cem&quot; (&#x27;a hundred&#x27;) : : nasal approximant must be pronounced.
* &quot;cantar&quot; (&#x27;to sing&#x27;) : : nasal consonant remains because of the following plosive; preceding vowel is raised and nasalized non-phonemically. (This is traditionally considered a &quot;nasal&quot; vowel by textbooks.)
* &quot;cano&quot; (&#x27;pipe&#x27;) : or : first vowel is necessarily raised, and may be nasalized non-phonemically.
* &quot;tomo&quot; (&#x27;I take&#x27;) : or : first vowel may be nasalized non-phonemically.

It follows from these observations that the vowels of BP can be described simply in the following way.
*BP has eight monophthongs——whose phonetic realizations may be affected by a nasal archiphoneme . The vowel is typically nasalized (in every position), but this is not phonemic.
*All eight vowels are differentiated in stressed and unstressed positions. But in word-final unstressed position and not followed by , they reduce to three vowels——in most dialects. In this position, has a free variation and this fatally impairs distinction. (For instance: the word &quot;ímã&quot; (&#x27;magnet&#x27;) is effectively pronounced as either &quot;ima&quot; or &quot;ímam&quot;, depending on speaker.)
*Like the ん of Japanese, the archiphoneme is a nasal archiphoneme of syllabic codas and its actual place of articulation is determined by the following sound:
**=;
**otherwise it becomes a nasal approximant (as in Japanese kan&#x27;i [かんい], etc.). After the vowels this approximant may also be pronounced as ; and after as (free variations).
*The system of eight monophthongs reduces to five——before and also in stressed syllables before heterosyllabic nasal consonants. The grapheme ⟨a⟩ stands for in these cases.
* is not allowed at word-final position because ⟨em⟩ stands for in this case. (Here means the same phoneme that ⟨nh⟩ represents; and may be nasalized non-phonemically.) This is the only case of in coda-position.
With this description, the examples from before are simply . Note that the aforementioned description may only apply to Southern-Southeastern dialects of Brazilian Portuguese. But there is no commonly accepted transcription for Brazilian Portuguese phonology.

Vowel nasalization in some dialects of Brazilian Portuguese is very different from that of French, for example. In French, the nasalization extends uniformly through the entire vowel, whereas in the Southern-Southeastern dialects of Brazilian Portuguese, the nasalization begins almost imperceptibly and then becomes stronger toward the end of the vowel. In this respect it is more similar to the nasalization of Hindi-Urdu (see Anusvara). In some cases, the nasal archiphoneme even entails the insertion of a nasal consonant such as (compare ), as in the following examples:
* &quot;banco&quot; 
* &quot;tempo&quot; 
* &quot;pinta&quot; 
* &quot;sombra&quot; 
* &quot;mundo&quot; 
* &quot;fã&quot; 
* &quot;falam&quot; 
* &quot;bem&quot; 
* &quot;vim&quot; 
* &quot;bom&quot; 
* &quot;um&quot; 
* &quot;mãe&quot; 
* &quot;pão&quot; 
* &quot;põe&quot; 
* &quot;muito&quot; 
===Nasal diphthongs===
Most times nasal diphthongs occur at the end of the word. They are:

* &quot;-ãe&quot; . It occurs in &quot;mãe(s)&quot; (&#x27;mother[s]&#x27;) and in the plural of some words ending in &quot;-ão&quot;, e.g., &quot;cães&quot; (&#x27;dogs&#x27;), &quot;pães&quot; (&#x27;breads&#x27;); and exceptionally non-finally in &quot;cãibra&quot; (&#x27;cramp&#x27;). In Central European Portuguese, it occurs also in all words ending in &quot;-em&quot;, like &quot;tem&quot; (&#x27;he/she/it has&#x27;), &quot;bem&quot; (&#x27;well&#x27;, &#x27;good&#x27;, as a noun), &quot;mentem&quot; (they lie), etc.
* &quot;-em&quot; . It occurs, both stressed and unstressed, in Brazilian Portuguese and in European Portuguese (both northern and southern) in word-final syllables ending in &quot;-em&quot; or &quot;-ém&quot;, like &quot;bem&quot;, &quot;sem&quot;, and &quot;além&quot;, as well as in verbs ending in &quot;-em&quot; (the 3rd person plural present indicative of verbs whose infinitives end in &quot;-er&quot; or &quot;-ir&quot;). In Greater Lisbon, has merged with ; and it occurs duplicated in &quot;têm&quot; or (3rd person plural present indicative of &quot;ter&quot;, originally &quot;tẽem&quot;), which in Brazilian is homophonous with &quot;tem&quot; (the 3rd person singular).
* &quot;-õe&quot; . It occurs:
** in the present indicative of &quot;pôr&quot; and its derivatives; in the 2nd person singular (&quot;pões&quot; , &quot;opões&quot;, &quot;compões&quot;, &quot;pressupões&quot;), in the 3rd person singular (&quot;põe&quot; , &quot;opõe&quot; etc.), and non-finally in the 3rd person plural (&quot;põem&quot; , &quot;opõem&quot; etc.).
**in the plural of many words ending in&quot;-ão&quot;, e.g., &quot;limões&quot; (&#x27;lemons&#x27;), &quot;anões&quot; (&#x27;dwarfs&#x27;), espiões (&#x27;spies&#x27;), &quot;iões&quot; (&#x27;ions&#x27;), &quot;catiões&quot; (&#x27;cations&#x27;), &quot;aniões&quot; (&#x27;anions&#x27;), &quot;eletrões&quot; (&#x27;electrons&#x27;), &quot;neutrões&quot; (&#x27;neutrons&#x27;), &quot;protões&quot; (&#x27;protons&#x27;), &quot;fotões&quot; (&#x27;photons&#x27;), &quot;positrões&quot; (&#x27;positrons&#x27;) and the plurals of all words with the suffix -ção (compare English -tion, like in communication), like comunicações (&#x27;communications&#x27;), provocações (&#x27;provocations&#x27;).
* &quot;-uim&quot; or &quot;-uin&quot; Example: &quot;pinguim&quot; (&#x27;penguin&#x27;).
* &quot;ui&quot; occurs only in the words &quot;muito&quot; and the uncommon &quot;mui&quot; . The nasalisation here may be interpreted as allophonic, bleeding over from the previous &quot;m&quot; (compare &quot;mãe&quot; with the same bleeding of nasality).
* &quot;-ão&quot; or &quot;-am&quot;. . Examples: &quot;pão (&#x27;bread&#x27;), &quot;cão (&#x27;dog&#x27;), &quot;estão (&#x27;they are&#x27;), &quot;vão (&#x27;they go&#x27;), &quot;limão (&#x27;lemon&#x27;), órgão&quot; (&#x27;organ&#x27;), &quot;Estêvão&quot; (&#x27;Steven&#x27;). When in the &quot;-am&quot; form (unstressed) they are always the 3rd person of the plural of a verb, like &quot;estavam&quot; (&#x27;they were&#x27;), &quot;contam&quot; (&#x27;they account&#x27;), &quot;escreveram&quot; (&#x27;they wrote&#x27;), &quot;partiram&quot; (&#x27;they left&#x27;).
* &quot;-om&quot; . It occurs in word-final syllables ending in &quot;-om&quot; like &quot;bom&quot; and &quot;som&quot;. However, it may be also monophthongized to .

 and are nasalized, non-syllabic counterparts of the vowels and , respectively. In European Portuguese, they are normally not fully close, being closer to . As with the oral , the nasal is not only more central but also more weakly rounded than the monophthong. This is not transcribed in this article.

===Vowel alternation===
The stressed relatively open vowels contrast with the stressed relatively close vowels in several kinds of grammatically meaningful alternation:

* Between the base form of a noun or adjective and its inflected forms: &quot;ovo&quot; (&#x27;egg&#x27;), &quot;ovos&quot; (&#x27;eggs&#x27;); &quot;novo&quot; , &quot;nova&quot; , &quot;novos&quot; , &quot;novas&quot; (&#x27;new&#x27;: masculine singular, feminine singular, masculine plural, feminine plural);
* Between some nouns or adjectives and related verb forms: adj. &quot;seco&quot; (&#x27;dry&#x27;), v. &quot;seco&quot; (&#x27;I dry&#x27;); n. &quot;gosto&quot; (&#x27;taste&#x27;), v. &quot;gosto&quot; (&#x27;I like&#x27;); n. &quot;governo&quot; (&#x27;government&#x27;) v. &quot;governo&quot; (&#x27;I govern&#x27;);
* Between different forms of some verbs: &quot;pôde&quot; (&#x27;he could&#x27;), &quot;pode&quot; (&#x27;he can&#x27;);
* Between some pairs of related words: &quot;avô&quot; (&#x27;grandfather&#x27;), &quot;avó&quot; (&#x27;grandmother&#x27;);
* In regular verbs, the stressed vowel is normally low , but high before the nasal consonants , , (the high vowels are also nasalized, in BP);
* Some stem-changing verbs alternate stressed high vowels with stressed low vowels in the present tense, according to a regular pattern: &quot;cedo&quot;, &quot;cedes&quot;, &quot;cede&quot;, &quot;cedem&quot; ; &quot;movo&quot;, &quot;moves&quot;, &quot;move&quot;, &quot;movem&quot; (present indicative); &quot;ceda&quot;, &quot;cedas&quot;, &quot;ceda&quot;, &quot;cedam&quot; ; &quot;mova&quot;, &quot;movas&quot;, &quot;mova&quot;, &quot;movam&quot; (present subjunctive). (There is another class of stem-changing verbs which alternate with according to the same scheme);
* In central Portugal, the 1st. person plural of verbs of the 1st. conjugation (with infinitives in &quot;-ar&quot;) has the stressed vowel in the present indicative, but in the preterite, cf. &quot;pensamos&quot; (&#x27;we think&#x27;) with &quot;pensámos&quot; (&#x27;we thought&#x27;). In BP, the stressed vowel is in both, so they are written without accent mark.

There are also pairs of unrelated words that differ in the height of these vowels, such as &quot;besta&quot; (&#x27;beast&#x27;) and &quot;besta&quot; (&#x27;crossbow&#x27;); &quot;mexo&quot; (&#x27;I move&#x27;) and &quot;mecho&quot; (&#x27;I highlight [hair]&#x27;); &quot;molho&quot; (&#x27;sauce&#x27;) and &quot;molho&quot; (&#x27;bunch&#x27;); &quot;corte&quot; (&#x27;cut&#x27;) and &quot;corte&quot; (&#x27;court&#x27;); &quot;meta&quot; (&#x27;I put&#x27; subjunctive) and &quot;meta&quot; (&#x27;goal&#x27;); and (especially in Portugal) &quot;para&quot; (&#x27;for&#x27;) and &quot;para&quot; (&#x27;he stops&#x27;); &quot;forma&quot; (&#x27;mold&#x27;) and &quot;forma&quot; (&#x27;shape&#x27;).

There are several minimal pairs in which a clitic containing the vowel contrasts with a monosyllabic stressed word containing : &quot;da&quot; vs. &quot;dá&quot;, &quot;mas&quot; vs. &quot;más&quot;, &quot;a&quot; vs. &quot;à&quot; , etc. In BP, however, these words may be pronounced with in some environments.

====Unstressed vowels====
Some isolated vowels (meaning those that are neither nasal nor part of a diphthong) tend to change quality in a fairly predictable way when they become unstressed. In the examples below, the stressed syllable of each word is in boldface. The term &quot;final&quot; should be interpreted here as at the end of a word or before word-final &quot;-s&quot;.

With a few exceptions mentioned in the previous sections, the vowels and occur in complementary distribution when stressed, the latter before nasal consonants followed by a vowel, and the former elsewhere.

In Brazilian Portuguese, the general pattern in the southern and western accents is that the stressed vowels , , neutralize to , , , respectively, in unstressed syllables, as is common in Romance languages. In final unstressed syllables, however, they are raised to , , . In casual BP (as well as in the &quot;fluminense&quot; dialect), unstressed and may be raised to , on &quot;any&quot; unstressed syllable, as long as it has no coda. However, in the dialects of Northeastern Brazilian (as spoken in the states of Bahia and Pernambuco), non-final unstressed vowels are often open-mid , , , independent of vowel harmony with surrounding lower vowels.

European Portuguese has taken this process one step further, raising , , to , , in almost all unstressed syllables. The vowels and are also more centralized than their Brazilian counterparts. The three unstressed vowels are reduced and often voiceless or elided in fast speech.

However, Angolan Portuguese has been more conservative, raising , , to , , in unstressed syllables; and to , , in final unstressed syllables. Which makes it almost similar to Brazilian Portuguese (except by final , which is inherited from European Portuguese).

There are some exceptions to the rules above. For example, occurs instead of unstressed or , word-initially or before another vowel in hiatus (&quot;teatro&quot;, &quot;reúne&quot;, &quot;peão&quot;). is often deleted entirely word-initially in the combination becoming . Also, , or appear in some unstressed syllables in EP, being marked in the lexicon, like &quot;espetáculo&quot; (spectacle) ; these occur from deletion of the final consonant in a closed syllable and from crasis. And there is some dialectal variation in the unstressed sounds: the northern and eastern accents of BP have low vowels in unstressed syllables, , instead of the high vowels . However, the Brazilian media tends to prefer the southern pronunciation. In any event, the general paradigm is a useful guide for pronunciation and spelling.

Nasal vowels, vowels that belong to falling diphthongs, and the high vowels and are not affected by this process, nor is the vowel when written as the digraph (pronounced in conservative EP).

==== Epenthesis ====
In BP, an epenthetic vowel is sometimes inserted between consonants, to break up consonant clusters that are not native to Portuguese, in learned words and in borrowings. This also happens at the ends of words after consonants that cannot occur word-finally (e.g., , , ). For example, &quot;psicologia&quot; (&#x27;psychology&#x27;) may be pronounced ; &quot;adverso&quot; (&#x27;adverse&#x27;) may be pronounced ; &quot;McDonald&#x27;s&quot; may be pronounced . In northern Portugal, an epenthetic may be used instead, , , but in southern Portugal there is often no epenthesis, , . Epenthesis at the end of a word does not normally occur in Portugal.

The native Portuguese consonant clusters, where there is not epenthesis, are sequences of a non-sibilant oral consonant followed by the liquids or , and the complex consonants . Some examples: flagrante&quot; , &quot;complexo&quot; , &quot;fixo&quot; (but not &quot;ficção&quot; ), &quot;latex , quatro&quot; , guaxinim&quot; , 

====Further notes on the oral vowels====

*Some words with in EP have in BP. This happens when those vowels are stressed before the nasal consonants , , followed by another vowel, in which case both types may occur in European Portuguese, but Brazilian Portuguese for the most part allows only mid or close-mid vowels. This can affect spelling: cf. EP &quot;tónico&quot;, BP &quot;tônico&quot; &quot;tonic&quot;.
*In most BP, stressed vowels have nasal allophones, , , , , , etc. (see below) before one of the nasal consonants , , , followed by another vowel. In São Paulo, Southern Brazil, and EP, nasalization is nearly absent in this environment, other than in compounds such as &quot;connosco&quot;, &quot;comummente&quot; (spelled &quot;conosco&quot;, &quot;comumente&quot; in BP).
*Most BP speakers also diphthongize stressed vowels in oxytones to , , , , , , etc. (sometimes ), before a sibilant coda (written &quot;s&quot; or &quot;z&quot;). For instance, &quot;Jesus&quot; (&#x27;Jesus&#x27;), &quot;faz&quot; (&#x27;he does&#x27;), &quot;dez&quot; (&#x27;ten&#x27;). This has led to the use of &quot;meia&quot; (from &quot;meia dúzia&quot; &#x27;half a dozen&quot;) instead of &quot;seis&quot; (&#x27;six&#x27;) when making enumerations, to avoid any confusion with &quot;três&quot; (&#x27;three&#x27;) on the telephone.
*In Greater Lisbon, is pronounced when it comes before a palatal consonant , , or a palato-alveolar , , followed by another vowel; as well as is pronounced .

==Sandhi==

When two words belonging to the same phrase are pronounced together, or two morphemes are joined in a word, the last sound in the first may be affected by the first sound of the next (sandhi), either coalescing with it, or becoming shorter (a semivowel), or being deleted. This affects especially the sibilant consonants , , , , and the unstressed final vowels , , .

===Consonant sandhi===
As was mentioned above, the dialects of Portuguese can be divided into two groups, according to whether syllable-final sibilants are pronounced as postalveolar consonants , or as alveolar , . At the end of words, the default pronunciation for a sibilant is voiceless, , but in connected speech the sibilant is treated as though it were within a word (assimilation):

* If the next word begins with a voiceless consonant, the final sibilant remains voiceless ; &quot;bons tempos&quot; or (&#x27;good times&#x27;).
* If the next word begins with a voiced consonant, the final sibilant becomes voiced as well ; &quot;bons dias&quot; or (&#x27;good days&#x27;).
* If the next word begins with a vowel, the final sibilant is treated as intervocalic, and pronounced ; &quot;bons amigos&quot; or (&#x27;good friends&#x27;).

When two identical sibilants appear in sequence within a word, they reduce to a single consonant. For example, &quot;nascer&quot;, &quot;desço&quot;, &quot;excesso&quot;, &quot;exsudar&quot; are pronounced with by speakers who use alveolar sibilants at the end of syllables, and &quot;disjuntor&quot; is pronounced with by speakers who use postalveolars. But if the two sibilants are different they may be pronounced separately, depending on the dialect. Thus, the former speakers will pronounce the last example with , whereas the latter speakers will pronounce the first examples with if they are from Brazil or if from Portugal (although in relaxed pronunciation one of the siblants may be dropped). This applies also to words that are pronounced together in connected speech:
* sibilant + , e.g., &quot;as sopas&quot;: either (most of Brazil); (Portugal, standard)
* sibilant + , e.g., &quot;as zonas&quot;: either (mostly in Brazil); (Portugal, standard)
* sibilant + , e.g., &quot;as chaves&quot;: always ;
* sibilant + , e.g., &quot;os genes&quot;: always .

===Vowel sandhi===
Normally, only the three vowels , (in BP) or (in EP), and occur in unstressed final position. If the next word begins with a similar vowel, they merge with it in connected speech, producing a single vowel, possibly long (crasis). Here, &quot;similar&quot; means that nasalization can be disregarded, and that the two central vowels can be identified with each other. Thus,

* → (henceforth transcribed ); &quot;toda a noite&quot; or (&#x27;all night&#x27;), &quot;nessa altura&quot; or (&#x27;at that point&#x27;).
* → ) (henceforth transcribed ); &quot;a antiga&quot; (&#x27;the ancient one&#x27;) and &quot;à antiga&quot; (&#x27;in the ancient way&#x27;), both pronounced or . The open nasalized appears only in this environment.
* → (henceforth transcribed ); &quot;de idade&quot; or (&#x27;aged&#x27;).
* → ; &quot;fila de espera&quot; (&#x27;waiting line&#x27;) (EP only).
* → (henceforth transcribed ); &quot;todo o dia&quot; or (&#x27;all day&#x27;).

If the next word begins with a dissimilar vowel, then and become approximants in Brazilian Portuguese (synaeresis):

* + V → ; &quot;durante o curso&quot; (&#x27;during the course&#x27;), &quot;mais que um&quot; (&#x27;more than one&#x27;).
* + V → ; &quot;todo este tempo&quot; (&#x27;all this time&#x27;) &quot;do objeto&quot; (&#x27;of the object&#x27;).

In careful speech and in with certain function words, or in some phrase stress conditions (see Mateus and d&#x27;Andrade, for details), European Portuguese has a similar process:

* + V → ; &quot;se a vires&quot; (&#x27;if you see her&#x27;), &quot;mais que um&quot; (&#x27;more than one&#x27;).
* + V → ; &quot;todo este tempo&quot; (&#x27;all this time&#x27;), &quot;do objeto&quot; (&#x27;of the object&#x27;).

But in other prosodic conditions, and in relaxed pronunciation, EP simply drops final unstressed and (elision), though this is subject to significant dialectal variation:
* &quot;durante o curso&quot; (&#x27;during the course&#x27;), &quot;este inquilino&quot; (&#x27;this tenant&#x27;).
* &quot;todo este tempo&quot; (&#x27;all this time&#x27;), &quot;disto há muito&quot; (&#x27;there&#x27;s a lot of this&#x27;).

Aside from historical set contractions formed by prepositions plus determiners or pronouns, like &quot;à/dà, ao/do&quot;, &quot;nesse&quot;, &quot;dele&quot;, etc., on one hand and combined clitic pronouns such as &quot;mo/ma/mos/mas&quot; (it/him/her/them to/for me), and so on, on the other, Portuguese spelling does not reflect vowel sandhi. In poetry, however, an apostrophe may be used to show elision such as in &quot;d&#x27;água&quot;.

==Stress==
Primary stress may fall on any of the three final syllables of a word, but most commonly on the last two, as antepenultimate stress is relatively less frequent in the language. There is a partial correlation between the position of the stress and the final vowel; for example, the final syllable is usually stressed when it contains a nasal phoneme, a diphthong, or a close vowel—this is especially relevant given the influence of Indigenous languages in Brazil, as indigenous words often have final stress: &quot;urubu&quot; &#x27;vulture&#x27;, &quot;açaí&quot; &#x27;açai&#x27;, both of which originate from Tupi and have final stress. The orthography of Portuguese takes advantage of this correlation to minimize the number of diacritics, but orthographic rules vary in different regions (e.g., Brazil and Portugal), and should not be used as a reliable guide to stress, despite the existing correlations found in the grapheme-phoneme conversion of Portuguese data. 

As in English, stress in verbs and non-verbs is computed differently. For verbs, stress is deterministic, as different morphemes determine the location of stress in a given word based on tense, mood, person and number. For this reason, the few examples one can find of minimal pairs of lexical stress involve either different verb forms for a given stem, such as &quot;ruíram&quot; /ʁuˈiɾɐ̃w̃/ &#x27;they collapsed&#x27; vs. &quot;ruirão&quot; /ʁuiˈɾɐ̃w̃/ &#x27;they will collapse&#x27;, or a noun-verb pair, such as &quot;dúvida&quot; /ˈduvidɐ/ &#x27;doubt&#x27; vs. &quot;duvida&quot; /duˈvidɐ/ &#x27;s/he doubts&#x27;. For example, regardless of which verb one considers, stress is always final for the first person singular in the future simple tense (indicative): &quot;(eu) falarei&quot; &#x27;I will speak&#x27;. For nouns and adjectives (i.e., non-verbs), stress is mostly affected by phonological factors such as syllable weight, although morphology also plays a role, as different suffixes may affect the location of stress in a given word. In simple terms, the algorithm for stress in non-verbs is similar to that of English and Latin (modulo the extrametricality of the final syllable, which is absent in Portuguese): stress is final if the final syllable is heavy and penultimate otherwise. A heavy syllable contains a diphthong or a coda consonant. All other patterns are considered to be irregular in most approaches in the literature, even though subregularities have been determined and discussed in recent studies. Finally, syllable weight has also been shown to affect the position of secondary stress in the language, whose location can vary in words with an odd number of pre-tonic syllables. In such words, there&#x27;s some experimental evidence showing that the presence of a given syllable containing a coda leads to a preference for secondary stress in said syllable.

==Prosody==

Tone is not lexically significant in Portuguese, but phrase- and sentence-level tones are important. As in most Romance languages, interrogation on yes–no questions is expressed mainly by sharply raising the tone at the end of the sentence. An exception to this is the word &quot;oi&quot; that is subject to meaning changes: an exclamation tone means &#x27;hi/hello&#x27;, and in an interrogative tone it means &#x27;I didn&#x27;t understand&#x27;.

As for prosodic domains, the presence of metrical feet in Portuguese has been called into question in a recent study, which argues that no strong evidence exists in the language that supports this particular domain (at least Brazilian Portuguese)—despite the presence of stress and secondary stress, both of which are typically (albeit not always) associated with feet.

<text>The Harrisburg Senators are a Minor League Baseball team who play in the Eastern League, and are the Double-A affiliate of the Washington Nationals. The team is based in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and play their home games at FNB Field on City Island, which opened in 1987 and has a seating capacity of 6,187.

The &quot;Senators&quot; nickname refers to the host city being the state&#x27;s capital and thus home of the Pennsylvania legislature. The team colors are red, navy blue, gold, and white, the same of the parent club, the Washington Nationals.

Harrisburg has won nine Eastern League titles and is the first team in league history to win four titles in a row: 1987, 1993, 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999. The 1993 Senators were recognized as one of the 100 greatest minor league teams of all time.

==Previous Harrisburg baseball history==

The city of Harrisburg has a long history of professional baseball. The Harrisburg Base Ball Association existed as long ago as 1884 (according to a stock certificate issued on March 1, 1884). According to another source, in 1901, the first baseball club in Harrisburg was created. In 1912, Harrisburg won the first of three Tri-State Association championships in a row. In 1915, an affiliated International League team moved from Newark, New Jersey, to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The club lasted one year before moving to the New York State League and disbanding. This left the city without professional baseball for seven years.

In 1924, an incarnation of the Senators joined the newly formed New York–Penn League which was eventually renamed the Eastern League. Initially, the Senators and most of the other New York–Penn League teams were not affiliated with a Major League Baseball team. In 1927, the Senators started a five-year campaign with three Eastern league championships, winning titles in 1927, 1928, and 1931. The Senators&#x27; reign ended in 1936, when flood waters from the surrounding Susquehanna River ruined their home ballpark, Island Field.

Another team representing Harrisburg affiliated with the Pittsburgh Pirates formed four years later, though in the smaller Interstate League. Like the Senators before it, the team gained success quickly, winning the league title one year later. The success, however, was short-lived, as the team moved to nearby York in 1943. Another team affiliated with the Cleveland Indians was created, but was not as successful. The Interstate League disbanded this Harrisburg team in 1952, and any form of professional baseball was not played in the city for the next 35 years.

==Modern franchise history==

===New England roots===
The modern Harrisburg Senators originated in the New England states. First established in 1976 as an affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers, the Berkshire Brewers played one season in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. After that season, they moved to Holyoke, Massachusetts, where they took the nickname the Millers.

In 1981, the franchise changed affiliations, moving from the Brewers to the California Angels. After the 1982 season, the team relocated to Nashua, New Hampshire, as the Nashua Angels. After the 1983 season, the team&#x27;s affiliation changed again, this time to the Pittsburgh Pirates. The team changed its name then to the Nashua Pirates.

At the same time, during the mid-1980s, Harrisburg Mayor Stephen Reed initiated a revitalization plan that included a ballpark for a new Minor League Baseball team in the city. The Nashua Pirates relocated to Harrisburg and was rechristened the Senators on December 9, 1986.

===The Senators===
Like the original Senators, success was quick, winning the Eastern League championship in its first season. In 1991, affiliation shifted from the Pittsburgh Pirates to the Montreal Expos, an affiliation continuing through that team&#x27;s move to Washington, D.C., where they continued as the Washington Nationals. The first several years of affiliation with Montreal brought consecutive championships from 1996 to 1998. In 1999, the Senators played the Norwich Navigators for a shot at their record-setting fourth consecutive Eastern League championship. In the bottom of the ninth inning of game 5, the Senators trailed by 3 runs, but with 2 outs, the bases loaded, and a full count Milton Bradley hit a walk-off grand slam to right center field to win the fourth-straight championship for the Senators, an Eastern League first. In 2003, Sueng Song pitched the first no-hitter in modern Senators history.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Senators were organized into the Double-A Northeast. In 2022, the Double-A Northeast became known as the Eastern League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

==Uniforms and logo==
The official colors of the Harrisburg Senators are red, navy blue, metallic gold, and white. The home and away uniforms resemble those of the Washington Nationals, with a red cap for home games and navy blue for away. Both caps include the &quot;H&quot; and streaking baseball logo, with the &quot;H&quot; in the same script as the Nationals&#x27; pretzel-shaped &quot;W.&quot; The white home jerseys include red and navy blue trim around the collar and sleeves with the &quot;Senators&quot; wordmark in red with metallic gold bevels and navy blue outline. The grey away jersey has navy blue and red trim around the collar and sleeves, with the &quot;Harrisburg&quot; wordmark in navy blue with metallic gold bevels and red outline. Both wordmarks are identical to the Nationals brand.

In 2007, the Senators added a unique logo to their brand, incorporating the prevalent and much reviled mayfly into the &quot;H.&quot; Because of FNB Field&#x27;s location on City Island in the Susquehanna River, thousands of mayflies are attracted to the ballpark&#x27;s bright lights, obscuring their view.

==Ownership==
The city of Harrisburg paid $6.7 million in 1995 to acquire the team from the previous owners of the franchise, who were planning to move the team to a new taxpayer-financed ballpark in Springfield, Massachusetts. Instead of appeasing the desires of the ownership group with a new stadium, Harrisburg Mayor Stephen Reed led the city of Harrisburg to purchase the team instead. The previous owners had bought the team only six months earlier for just $4.1 million.

Citing the ballpark as the major link in his downtown revitalization project, when asked how he could afford the hefty price tag, Mayor Reed responded by asking, &quot;How could we not?&quot; For a time, the Senators remained one of the only sports franchises in the United States to be completely owned by the community in which it was based. In 2006, the city put the team up for sale to combat a major budget deficit. Mayor Reed stipulated that the new owner must keep the team in Harrisburg for at least 29 years.

The team was eventually bought by Senators Partners, LLC of Northbrook, Illinois, headed by Jerry Reinsdorf&#x27;s son Michael, for an Eastern League record $13.25 million. Mark Butler, CEO of Ollie&#x27;s Bargain Outlet, became the team&#x27;s majority owner in March 2015, replacing Michael Reinsdorf who was principal owner and managing partner; the purchase price was not disclosed.

In April 2024, it was announced that the team had been sold to Diamond Baseball Holdings (DBH), a sports management group owned by Silver Lake, an American private equity firm.

==Triple-A franchise bid==
In mid-2005, Peter Angelos, the owner of the Baltimore Orioles, gained the permission of the Double-A Eastern League and the Triple-A International League to move Baltimore&#x27;s Triple-A affiliate from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, to Harrisburg. One of the hangups with the agreement was that a buyer for the Double-A Senators franchise had to be found. The Ottawa franchise moved to Allentown, Pennsylvania, as the Triple-A team for the Philadelphia Phillies, renamed as the Lehigh Valley IronPigs. The Baltimore Orioles also signed a player development deal with the Norfolk Tides of the International League. The Tides became be the Triple-A affiliate of the Orioles.

==Stadium renovation==
FNB Field received a $32 million renovation ($19.1 million in state funding) in two stages. Originally the renovation was to begin in 2005; however, delays in state funding for the project were postponed until 2008, meaning the improvements were not implemented for Senators fans until the 2009 season, and the second stage was completed before the 2010 season.

==Life Size Bobblehead Hall of Fame==
In 2016, the Harrisburg Senators started a tradition by recognizing great players from their history in a unique way, The One &amp; Only World-Famous, Life Size Bobblehead Hall of Fame. These enshrined Senators&#x27; legends will each receive their own life-size bobblehead. The life-size bobbleheads will be on permanent display at FNB Field with each bobblehead holding a commemorative plaque. The Senators plan to enshrine players yearly.

==Broadcast==
Every Harrisburg Senators ballgame is aired on 1460 the Ticket (AM 1460 WTKT – Clear Channel). Terry Byrom has been the voice of the Senators since 2005. The games are also streamed on the team&#x27;s website. Some games are also aired on the local TV station, Comcast Network, and occasionally has games aired on MASN. The first radio play-by-play broadcaster for the Senators was Dan Kamal, who did the broadcasts from 1987 until the mid-1990s. Kamal at the time was also the radio voice of the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League. He later was a TV analyst and studio host for the Atlanta Thrashers and then the Columbus Blue Jackets of the National Hockey League.

<text>Automatic Colt Pistol (ACP) denotes various John Moses Browning cartridge designs primarily used in Colt and Fabrique Nationale de Herstal semi-automatic pistols. All of these cartridges are straight-sided and appear similar. The .32 ACP, .38 ACP, and .25 ACP are semi-rimmed and headspace on the rim, while the rimless .45 ACP and .380 ACP headspace on the mouth of the case.

==ACP cartridges==

* .32 ACP (7.65×17mmSR) – 1899
* .38 ACP (9×23mmSR) – 1900
* .25 ACP (6.35×16mmSR) – 1905
* .45 ACP (11.43×23mm) – 1905
* .380 ACP (9x17mm) – 1908

==History==
Colt has manufactured several self-loading pistols. The first was the Colt M1900 made from 1900 to 1902 exclusively for the .38 ACP. The Colt Model 1903 Pocket Hammer was manufactured for the same .38 ACP cartridge from 1902 to 1928. The M1905 military pistol was manufactured for the .45 ACP cartridge from 1905 to 1912. The M1905 was replaced by the military M1911 pistol which remained in production until 1970. The Colt Model 1903 Pocket Hammerless pistol was manufactured for the .32 ACP from 1903 to 1941 and as the Model 1908 for the .380 ACP from 1908 to 1941. The Colt Model 1908 Vest Pocket pistol was manufactured for the .25 ACP from 1908 to 1941.

<doc id="672412" wikidata="Q3437744" url="?curid=672412" title="New Britain Rock Cats">
<text>The New Britain Rock Cats were a minor league baseball team that competed in the Eastern League. They were the Double-A affiliate of the Boston Red Sox for 12 years, the Minnesota Twins for 20 years and the Colorado Rockies for one. They played their home games at New Britain Stadium in New Britain, Connecticut. The team moved to Dunkin&#x27; Donuts Park in nearby Hartford before the 2016 season, becoming the Hartford Yard Goats.

==History==
The franchise&#x27;s timeline can be traced back to Pittsfield, Massachusetts, where they were a Boston Red Sox Double-A affiliate from 1965 to 1969. The franchise then moved to Pawtucket, Rhode Island in 1970, and spent three years in the Ocean State. When the Pawtucket Red Sox became a Triple-A team in 1973, the Red Sox moved their Double-A franchise to Bristol, Connecticut. Known as the Bristol Red Sox, the team played at Muzzy Field for ten seasons from 1973 to 1982. Starting with the 1983 season, owner Joe Buzas moved the team some ten miles east to New Britain. Then known as the New Britain Red Sox, the team played its home games at Beehive Field, which is still standing next to the current stadium.

As Beehive Field became outdated and new facilities began to pop up in other cities around the league, Buzas was faced with the choice of staying in New Britain and building a new stadium, versus moving the franchise again. The Red Sox front office, led by Dan Duquette supported the idea of moving to Springfield, Massachusetts, because it was closer to their fan base and closer to the Western Massachusetts home of Duquette. Ultimately, however, in August 1994, Buzas decided to keep the franchise in New Britain. The Red Sox promptly pulled their affiliation and instead chose to affiliate with the Trenton Thunder in the capital city of New Jersey, which was actually farther away from the fan base. For the 1995 season, Buzas, who owned the Salt Lake Buzz (Minnesota triple A), signed a new development agreement with the Minnesota Twins, an affiliation that lasted until the end of the 2014 season. During the 1995 season (their only season in Beehive Field), the team was known as the Hardware City Rock Cats, a reference to New Britain&#x27;s nickname &quot;The Hardware City&quot;. The current ballpark, New Britain Stadium, opened in 1996. The team name changed to &quot;New Britain&quot; Rock Cats in 1997. Stanley Works continues to be a significant sponsor of the team and ballpark.

During 2003 and 2004, the team was involved in several lawsuits over its night game fireworks displays. A group of residents living near the stadium claimed the noise was disruptive, and the ash and debris damaged their cars and homes. In May 2005, after attending a game, Judge Marshall Berger allowed the shows to continue but ruled they be limited to once monthly and use quieter fireworks.

On July 12, 2008, the Rock Cats established a franchise record for single game attendance. The crowd of 8,115 marked the first time the 8,000 mark was surpassed for a game at New Britain Stadium. This record was broken on June 27, 2009, with a crowd of 8,212. On July 10, 2013, the Rock Cats hosted the Eastern League All-Star Game at New Britain Stadium. The event drew 8,633 fans, shattering the previous single game attendance record. The Rock Cats reached the 8,000 mark once again on May 31, 2014 with a crowd of 8,079. The record was ultimately broken on August 28, 2015, when 8,672 fans watched the team&#x27;s last Friday home game.

On June 4, 2014, it was announced that the Rock Cats would move to Hartford, Connecticut, in 2016, signing a 25-year lease for a new stadium that would be built. On March 18, 2015, the team announced it would be known as the Hartford Yard Goats beginning in 2016. On June 17, 2014, it was announced that the Hartford Yard Goats new stadium for the 2016 season would be named Dunkin&#x27; Donuts Park. The Rock Cats played their last game at New Britain Stadium on August 30, 2015.

On September 16, 2014, the Minnesota Twins severed their affiliation ties with the Rock Cats, and the Rock Cats signed a two-year player development deal with the Colorado Rockies the next day.

==Popular culture==
The New Britain Rock Cats were featured in an episode of ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Mayne Street&quot; short comedy series.

An article about the Rock Cats can be seen below an article about the South Carolina Buzz (the fictional AAA affiliate of the Twins) during a bus scene in &quot;Major League: Back to the Minors&quot;.

<text>The Professional Chess Association (PCA), which existed between 1993 and 1996, was a rival organisation to FIDE, the International Chess Federation. The PCA was created in 1993 by Garry Kasparov and Nigel Short for the marketing and organization of their Chess World Championship.

==Formation==

In 1993, Nigel Short won the Candidates Tournament and so qualified as challenger to Garry Kasparov for the World Chess Championship.

By FIDE regulation, the bids for where the World Championship final is played should have been decided by three parties – FIDE, the World Champion (Kasparov) and the Challenger (Short). According to Kasparov and Short, FIDE president Florencio Campomanes broke these rules by simply announcing the venue of the winning bid as being Manchester. FIDE derived a substantial part of its income from the prize fund of the World Championship.

In response to this, Kasparov and Short formed the PCA, appointing Bob Rice as Commissioner. They played their world championship match under its auspices in September and October 1993. The match took place in the Savoy Theatre in London, under the sponsorship of &quot;The Times&quot;. Kasparov won clearly 12.5–7.5 and became PCA World Chess Champion.

FIDE stripped Kasparov of the FIDE World Championship title, and instead held a rival match between Anatoly Karpov and Jan Timman, the two final players Short had defeated to win the Candidates Tournament. Karpov won that match, to become FIDE World Chess Champion. For the first time in chess history there were two world champions, the FIDE world champion Karpov and the PCA world champion Kasparov.

==1995 cycle==

From 1993 to 1995, the PCA held an Interzonal tournament and Candidates matches, in the style of the FIDE world championship qualifiers. FIDE also had its own cycle of qualifiers, with many of the same players playing in both. The PCA candidates cycle was won by the Indian GM Viswanathan Anand.

Kasparov defended his PCA World Championship title against Anand in the World Trade Center in a match starting September 11, 1995. Kasparov won the best-of-20 game match 10.5 – 7.5.

==Demise and aftermath==

The PCA announced in January 1996 that it had lost its main sponsor, Intel. It was reported at the time that Kasparov said this was partly due to his choice to play a match against IBM&#x27;s supercomputer Deep Blue later that year. Kasparov, however, hotly disputes this and has proposed a different history, with Intel dropping sponsorship in November 1995, some weeks prior to the initial planning of the Deep Blue match.

The PCA folded soon afterwards, leaving Kasparov unable to organise a proper qualifying cycle for his title. He finally played (and lost) a match to a hand-picked challenger, Vladimir Kramnik, in 2000 (Classical World Chess Championship 2000). This match was played under the auspices of Brain Games.

When Kramnik defended his title at the Classical World Chess Championship 2004, he gave the title the name &quot;Classical&quot;, to emphasise the continuity that his title had with the tradition of defeating the previous titleholder. Since this is the same title as the Kasparov&#x27;s PCA World title, the PCA World title is sometimes retrospectively called the &quot;Classical&quot; title.

The PCA split from FIDE was finally healed with the FIDE World Chess Championship 2006, a re-unification match between Kramnik and 2005 FIDE World Champion Veselin Topalov, which was won by Kramnik.

<text>Emil Telmányi (22 June 1892 – 13 June 1988) was a Hungarian violinist.

Telmányi was born in Arad, Partium, Transylvania, then in the Kingdom of Hungary.

Telmányi began playing the violin at the age of six and made his public debut at thirteen. His evident talent earned him entry into the soloist classes at the Budapest Academy of Music under the tutelage of the renowned Jenö Hubay. Additionally, he studied composition with Hans Koessler and received conducting instruction. In 1906, he won the Reményi Prize and graduated in 1911 from the academy with both artistic and teaching diplomas, also completing his high school exams the same year. His artistic career began in 1911 with a debut in Berlin, where he performed Sie Edward Elgar&#x27;s newly composed Violin Concerto for the first time in Germany. It was attended by the pianist Ignaz Friedman, who befriended him and arranged some of his early concerts in Copenhagen, where he later settled. He became an exponent of the composer Carl Nielsen, having recorded some of his violin sonatas and his violin concerto. 

Based in Berlin, Telmányi began extensive international tours in 1912 with pianist Ignaz Friedman, becoming a highly respected soloist. That same year, he was warmly received in Copenhagen, where he became acquainted with Carl Nielsen and his compositions. Except for a brief period of conscription during World War I, Telmányi continued his concert tours, returning frequently to Copenhagen. In 1918, he married Carl Nielsen&#x27;s youngest daughter, painter Anne Marie, and settled in Budapest. After the war, they moved permanently to Copenhagen, from where Telmányi continued his travels, performing across Europe and the USA, and returning annually to Hungary. On these journeys, he became a distinguished ambassador for Danish music, particularly Nielsen&#x27;s works, and continued his artistic career until the age of 75, notably performing in the Telmányi Quintet with his second wife, violinist and pianist Annette, and their three daughters. Since 1919, Telmányi also worked as a conductor, in Copenhagen (with The Young Musicians&#x27; Society Orchestra, his chamber orchestra, and the Royal Danish Theatre, where he adapted Carl Nielsen’s Aladdin music for Elna Jørgen Jensen&#x27;s (Elna Ørnberg) ballet &quot;Asra&quot; in 1932), and during the 1920s in Budapest, Gothenburg, and other locations. Even as of 1982, he conducted the Centerskolen Orchestra in Holte. Despite his extensive travels, he remained a significant figure in Danish musical life. Telmányi&#x27;s passionate artistic temperament, combined with a noble sense of musical grandeur, has provided a strong impetus to Danish music, further enhanced by his pedagogical work privately and from 1940 to 1969 as a teacher at the Royal Academy of Music in Aarhus. His lifelong interest in Johann Sebastian Bach’s violin works and their performance challenges led to the creation of a special &quot;Bach bow&quot; (developed with Arne Hjorth in 1949 and Knud Vestergaard in 1953), which allows for enhanced polyphonic emphasis, particularly in Bach&#x27;s solo violin partitas and sonatas. Telmányi recorded numerous records, including works by Carl Nielsen, F. Mendelssohn, and J. Sibelius, and particularly notable are his recordings of chamber music by Nielsen and Brahms, as well as Bach&#x27;s solo works using Vestergaard’s &quot;Vega Bach bow.&quot; In 1978, he published his memoirs, &quot;From a Musician’s Picture Book&quot;, offering valuable insights into musical figures such as Carl Nielsen, Zoltán Kodály, Béla Bartók, Ferruccio Busoni, Arnold Schoenberg, among others, and in 1982, he released a guide to studying and interpreting Carl Nielsen’s violin works and string quintet. 

One of his most famous recordings is a 1954 recording of Bach&#x27;s Sonatas and partitas for solo violin played using a violin with what was referred to as the &quot;Vega&quot; Bach Bow (recorded in November 1953 and March 1954, DANA CORD, DACO 147), which could be adjusted so the player could play three or even all four strings of the violin at once. He died, aged 95, in Holte, Denmark.

<doc id="672434" wikidata="Q7298666" url="?curid=672434" title="Raymond Cho (politician)">
<text>Raymond Sung Joon Cho (; born November 18, 1936) is a Canadian politician who has served as the Ontario minister of seniors and accessibility since June 29, 2018. A member of the Progressive Conservative (PC) Party, Cho has sat as a member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) since 2016. He currently represents Scarborough North, and is the Legislative Assembly&#x27;s oldest sitting MPP. Cho&#x27;s over 30-year long political career began in 1991 when he was first elected to the Metro Toronto Council. Following amalgamation in 1998, Cho ran for Toronto City Council, where he re-elected eight times until resigning in 2016 following a successful run for Scarborough—Rouge River in a provincial by-election. Prior to entering politics, Cho worked as a social worker.

== Early life and education ==
Cho immigrated to Canada from South Korea in 1967. He worked as a janitor, waiter and miner, before attending the University of Toronto. Already holding an undergraduate degree from Korea, he completed a Master of Social Work, Master of Education, and a Doctorate of Counseling Psychology. Cho then worked as a social worker for the Catholic Children&#x27;s Aid Society, the Toronto Board of Education, and the Scarborough Board of Education.

=== Personal life ===
Cho is married to Soon Ok, and has three adult sons: Raymond Jr., Ronald, and William.

In 2018, while campaigning in Scarborough, Cho suffered a stroke. He was taken to Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and treated in intensive care. Cho continued to suffer balance issues after his stay in hospital.

==Political career==
Cho was a New Democratic Party (NDP) candidate in Scarborough—Rouge River for election to the House of Commons in the 1988 federal election. He was initially identified as a New Democrat when he joined Metro Council, however, he soon became an ally and supporter of then-Metropolitan Toronto Chairman Alan Tonks and dropped his NDP affiliation. He subsequently took out membership in the Liberal Party though, like most non-NDP municipal politicians in Ontario he did not run on a party label in municipal elections.

He was first elected to Metropolitan Toronto Council for Scarborough-Malvern in 1991, and was re-elected in 1994. After the Scarborough and the other suburbs were amalgamated into the new City of Toronto, Cho was elected to the new council representing Scarborough-Malvern in 1997 along with Bas Balkissoon. In 2000, he was again re-elected, representing the new ward of Scarborough Rouge-River. He won re-election in 2003, 2006 and 2010. Cho was Chairman of the Toronto Zoo for two successive terms.

He ran in the 2004 federal election as an independent candidate in Scarborough—Rouge River. Cho called himself an &quot;independent Liberal&quot;, and used the Liberal Party of Canada&#x27;s red-and-white colours for his campaign materials. He was accused of trying to mislead voters by the official Liberal candidate, Derek Lee. Lee, who has been the MP since 1988 said that Cho caused some controversy by claiming to have been shut out of the candidate nomination process. Lee won the election, Cho placed a distant second with 6,692 votes (17.8% of the total).

On August 13, 2004, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; reported that Cho spent nearly all of his allotted councillor expense fund, one of the highest on city council. While there was some speculation that some of this money was diverted to Cho&#x27;s failed bid to run in the federal election campaign, his executive assistant said the money was needed for newsletters mailed out to constituents to provide information on a rash of fatal shootings in the Malvern neighbourhood earlier in the year.

In 2005, Cho expressed interest in being the Ontario Liberal Party&#x27;s candidate in the Scarborough—Rouge River provincial by-election which was made necessary by the appointment of incumbent Liberal MPP Alvin Curling to a diplomatic position. However, the Liberal riding association used a clause of its constitution to declare another city councillor, Bas Balkissoon, as its candidate without a contested nomination process. Media reports suggested that this was done to exclude Cho as the provincial riding association was displeased with Cho&#x27;s &quot;independent Liberal&quot; candidacy in the 2004 federal election. Cho was also mentioned as a potential candidate for the Progressive Conservatives since he helped former leader John Tory during the March 2005 by-election in Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey. In the end, Cho chose not to run in the by-election which was won handily by Balkissoon.

In 2012, Cho was named as the Progressive Conservative candidate for the provincial riding of Scarborough—Rouge River. In the 2014 provincial election, Cho placed third with 27.68% of the vote.

In 2016, Cho was nominated as the Progressive Conservative Party candidate for the September 1 by-election in Scarborough—Rouge River, after incumbent Liberal MPP Bas Balkissoon resigned to spend more time with family. Cho won the by-election in an upset victory, becoming the first Korean-Canadian elected to the Ontario Legislature. Cho was handily re-elected in 2018 in the new riding of Scarborough North, winning over half of the popular vote. Doug Ford, then a former city councillor, served as his campaign chair.

During the 2018 Ontario general election, Cho was involved in a physical altercation with a 12-year-old child while campaigning. He later apologized.

<doc id="672440" wikidata="Q1756095" url="?curid=672440" title="The (International) Noise Conspiracy">
<text>The (International) Noise Conspiracy (abbreviated T(I)NC) was a Swedish rock band formed in late 1998. The lineup consisted of Dennis Lyxzén (vocals), Inge Johansson (bass), Lars Strömberg (guitar), and Ludwig Dahlberg (drums). The band was known for its punk and garage rock influences, along with its passionate left-wing political stance. Until 2004, guitarist/organist/keyboardist Sara Almgren was also part of the group. Dennis Lyxzén formed The (I)NC shortly after the breakup of his previous band, Refused. The (I)NC drew on the musical roots of at least four other bands, including Totalt Jävla Mörker (Johansson), Separation (Strömberg), Saidiwas (Dahlberg and Almgren), and Doughnuts (Almgren). In 2007, Inge Johansson also played with the band The Most.

Influenced by a quote from 1960s folk singer Phil Ochs, lead singer Lyxzén stated that the band aimed to blend music and politics into &quot;a cross between Elvis Presley and Che Guevara.&quot; Additionally, according to the liner notes of their debut album, &quot;The First Conspiracy&quot;, the band sought to challenge music&#x27;s role as a Spectacle—a concept derived from Guy Debord&#x27;s work, &quot;The Society of the Spectacle&quot;.

== History ==

=== First recordings ===
In 1999, the band recorded their debut album, &quot;The First Conspiracy&quot;, with G7 Welcoming Committee Records. While not a commercial success, the album gained the band recognition from the punk label Burning Heart Records, which had previously released records by some of the members&#x27; earlier bands. In 2000, they released &quot;Survival Sickness&quot;. Widely regarded as one of the finest examples of situationist-influenced punk rock, &quot;Survival Sickness&quot; showcased the band&#x27;s revolutionary ideology with biting lyrics and infectious rhythms. Many of the lyrics were drawn directly from the writings of the Situationist International, particularly Raoul Vaneigem&#x27;s &quot;The Revolution of Everyday Life&quot;.

By 2001, the band returned to Burning Heart&#x27;s studio to record their next album, &quot;A New Morning, Changing Weather&quot;. With the addition of Almgren&#x27;s organ playing, The (International) Noise Conspiracy created a sound that extended beyond the boundaries of typical punk music. Incorporating organs, horns, and keys, the band began to develop a reputation for eclectic instrumentation, a characteristic they would continue to refine.

=== Touring ===

The band&#x27;s first tour outside their homeland of Sweden took them to China, where they performed in illegal and hidden rock clubs while Chinese police reportedly waited outside armed with guns and nightsticks. They also toured the United States with My Chemical Romance. The band&#x27;s lead singer described their music as similar to The Hives but with a political edge, as The (International) Noise Conspiracy incorporates a strong Situationist agenda into some of their work, exemplified by songs like &quot;Capitalism Stole My Virginity.&quot;

=== Later recordings ===
Between 2002 and 2003, the &quot;Up for Sale EP&quot; (Sympathy for the Record Industry) and &quot;Bigger Cages, Longer Chains EP&quot; (2003, Burning Heart/Epitaph Records) were recorded. The band&#x27;s 16 March 2002 performance in Bremen, Germany was recorded and released by Tobby Holzinger (Your Choice Records) as &quot;Your Choice Live Series Vol. 25&quot;.

In 2004, The (International) Noise Conspiracy collaborated with producer Rick Rubin for their next album. Swedish jazz saxophonist Jonas Kullhammar temporarily joined the band on saxophone and keyboards, co-writing some of the songs. Organists Billy Preston and Benmont Tench also joined the lineup temporarily, as Sara Almgren left to join the Swedish punk band The Vicious (later Masshysteri). Rick Rubin signed the band to his label, American Recordings. The result was the release of &quot;Armed Love&quot; in 2004. The album&#x27;s inlay paid tribute to the slogan &quot;¡O Bailan todos, o no baila nadie!&quot; written by the Tupamaros, which translates to &quot;Either Everyone Dances, or No One Dances!&quot; According to the band, this phrase reflects their philosophy and music.

In 2006, The (International) Noise Conspiracy contributed a cover of &quot;Shut Up&quot; to The Monks tribute album &quot;Silver Monk Time: A Tribute to The Monks&quot;, which was released in October.

By 2007, the band had completed recording a new album. In an interview for Rockstar.tv on 28 August, they announced plans to name the album &quot;The Cross of My Calling&quot;, stating it would feature &quot;mystical&quot; lyrics and a more soulful sound. The album was released on 17 November 2008 in Europe and 25 November in America. The fourteen-track album was produced by Rick Rubin and released through Burning Heart, American, and Vagrant Records.

<doc id="672445" wikidata="Q1639083" url="?curid=672445" title="Nepean, Ontario">
<text>Nepean ( ) is an area of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Located west of Ottawa&#x27;s inner core, it was an independent city until amalgamated with the Regional Municipality of Ottawa–Carleton in 2001 to become the new city of Ottawa. However, the name Nepean continues in common usage in reference to the area. The population of Nepean is about 186,593 people (2021 Census).

Nepean&#x27;s policies of operational and capital budgeting prudence contrasted with the budget philosophies of some other municipalities in the area. Nepean instituted a strict &#x27;pay-as-you-go&#x27; budgeting scheme. The city entered amalgamation with a large surplus and a record of tax restraint. However, most big-ticket municipal infrastructure items (transit, garbage collection, sanitary sewers, water, arterial roads, social services) were the responsibility of the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton. It maintained its own library system from 1954 to amalgamation, its own police force from 1964 until it was regionalized in the 1990s; its own fire service and its own recreation programs. Hydro services were the responsibility of the Hydro-Electric Commission of the City of Nepean (commonly referred to as Nepean Hydro). Education in the City of Nepean was provided by the Carleton Board of Education (later amalgamated with the Ottawa Board of Education to form the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board).

Prior to amalgamation, Nepean&#x27;s City Council spent many tax dollars aggressively campaigning against what they (and their allies) referred to as the &quot;megacity&quot; model. The central plank of the strategy was to promote a tri-city model, which would have seen the ten municipalities of the Ottawa region reduced to three: one in the west (comprising Nepean, Kanata and the western rural municipalities), one in the east (comprising Gloucester, Cumberland and the eastern rural municipalities) and one in the centre (comprising Ottawa, Vanier and Rockcliffe Park). These efforts were in vain, as the one-city model eventually prevailed. (The one-city model was recommended by Glen Shortliffe, who was appointed by the Government of Ontario to study the issue of municipal reform in Ottawa-Carleton.)

== History ==
Nepean Township, originally known as Township D, was established in 1792 and originally included what is now the central area of Ottawa west of the Rideau River. Jehiel Collins, from Vermont, is believed to have been the first person to settle in Nepean Township, on the future site of Bytown. Nepean was incorporated as a city on November 24, 1978. The geographic boundaries of Nepean changed considerably over this time; the original town hall of the township of Nepean was located in Westboro, which was annexed in 1950 by the city of Ottawa. Nepean&#x27;s centre then moved to the community of Bells Corners. In the 1950 and 1960s, Nepean&#x27;s urban area began to expand in previous rural areas in such areas as the community of Centrepointe in the east, and the community of Barrhaven in the south.

In 1853, the City of Nepean realized that a community library was needed. By means of a bylaw and a tax levy, a library was created. In 1870, a large fire swept through Nepean, destroying several of the schoolhouses where books were stored. For the next eighty years, the library was but a memory. It was in 1951, when Ruth E. Dickinson moved to Nepean from Calgary, that she become the driving force to develop a library in Nepean. The Nepean Public Library was officially opened on March 1, 1957 and was originally known as the City View Public Library. It became the Nepean Township Public Library on December 27, 1962

Prior to its amalgamation with 10 other municipalities into the new city of Ottawa in 2001, the population of Nepean was 124,878. The 2006 census population was 138,596.

Nepean was named after Sir Evan Nepean, British Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department from 1782 to 1791.

A Nepean quarry provided the sandstone blocks that were the principal building material used in the Parliament Buildings in downtown Ottawa.

In September 2018, Nepean was one of the regions hit by a powerful storm that spawned six tornados in the Ottawa area, causing widespread damage to the Arlington Woods, Craig Henry and Colonnade Road Business Park areas.

== Economy ==
Although the neighbouring municipality of Kanata formed the entrepreneurial and high tech centre of the region, Nepean hosted noted industries such as Nortel Networks, JDS Uniphase, and Gandalf Technologies. As with the rest of the National Capital Region, however, Nepean&#x27;s economy was also heavily dependent on federal government employment. Most of Nepean&#x27;s employed residents commute to downtown Ottawa or Kanata for work.

Running north-south, Merivale Road is the retail centre of Nepean, offering many smaller shops as well as big box stores. Colonnade Road Business Park is to the west of Merivale Road and south of Borden Farm, supporting many businesses along its two branches, including some federal offices such as the Public Health Agency of Canada and Canadian Corps of Commissionaires, and an OC Transpo bus depot. The boulevard of Hunt Club West hosts a large auto mall, big box stores, PetSmart, and Costco&#x27;s Canadian headquarters, as well as a retail location. Further south is the Bentley Avenue industrial park where many independent auto shops are located, and a precast concrete factory. Several petroleum companies have fuel storage facilities in the area.

== Places of interest ==
Ben Franklin Place, located in Centrepointe, was the city hall for Nepean until it became a part of Ottawa. Now, it serves as a government office and client service centre, as well as continuing to be home to a branch of the Ottawa Public Library and the Centrepointe Theatre.

Nepean Museum located at 16 Rowley Avenue, Nepean Ontario is a museum that collects, preserves, researches, exhibits and interprets the works of man and nature in Nepean.

The building was ravaged by a fire on February 7, 2010, and was demolished in 2011.

<text>Alternative Press is an American entertainment magazine primarily focused on music and culture. It generally provides readers with band interviews, photos, and relevant news. It was founded in 1985 by Mike Shea in Cleveland, OH. The company is now managed by MDDN, and based in Los Angeles, CA.

== History ==
The first issue of &quot;Alternative Press&quot; was distributed at concerts in Cleveland, Ohio beginning in June 1985 by &quot;AP&quot;&#x27;s founder, Mike Shea to advocate for bands playing underground music. The name of the magazine, &quot;Alternative Press&quot;, was not a reference to the alternative rock genre, but referred to this fanzine being an alternative to the local press. Shea began working on his first issue in his mother&#x27;s house in Aurora, Ohio. Shea and a friend, Jimmy Kosicki, targeted the Cleveland neighborhood of Coventry. Financial problems plagued &quot;AP&quot; in its early years, and by the end of 1986, publication had paused due to its financial problems, only resuming until the spring of 1988. With the growth of alternative rock in the early 1990s, its circulation began to increase. Notable &quot;AP&quot; covers included bands such as Red Hot Chili Peppers and Soundgarden. By 1994, the magazine was doing cover stories on Beastie Boys, Henry Rollins and Love and Rockets.

By the early 2000s, after resisting attempts to reform and design the so called &quot;fanzine,&quot; Shea and Bobby Crist breathed new life into the publication and sought new avenues for its survival, revamping the magazine and marketing it in many venues. They shifted the focus of &quot;Alternative Press&quot; to the newer punk music associated with the Warped Tour. At the time of its 20th anniversary in 2005, &quot;AP&quot; had grown to an average size of 112 pages per issue, eventually averaging between 198 and 220+ pages a month. 

&quot;AP&quot; sponsored a radio show which aired on XM Radio, a podcast featuring in-depth discussions on various topics with people such as Fall Out Boy&#x27;s Pete Wentz and Kevin Lyman, and a compilation CD.

Nearing the end of the 2000s AP would venturing into hosting tours with AP Tours, documenting musicians day-by-day on the publications YouTube channel, and working with large scale music events.

In the fall of 2020, &quot;Alternative Press&quot; was sold to MDDN, owned by Good Charlotte members Benji and Joel Madden. In the 2020s, &quot;AP&quot;&#x27;s digital and print content has shifted toward highlighting rising artists and introducing them to the magazine&#x27;s audience. Cover stars include artists such as Waterparks, Rina Sawayama, Chase Atlantic, Willow Smith and more. The editorial shift has expanded their coverage to broader avenues that touched on lifestyle, culture, and style conversations within the alternative sphere. By 2022, the brand had formed new franchises to symbolise the shift in direction, such as Gen AP, and AP&amp;R. In January 2022, &quot;Alternative Press&quot; closed its offices in Cleveland, Ohio and relocated to Burbank, California.

2022 saw Avril Lavigne debut on their March Issue, and other notable cover stars that year included Demi Lovato, Louis Tomlinson, Spiritbox, and Arctic Monkeys. Upon the release of their Demi Lovato cover, the print publication announced it would be moving to quarterly releases, as opposed to its monthly roll-out.

==The Alternative Press Music Awards==

The Alternative Press Music Awards was an annual music awards show in the United States, founded by the music magazine &quot;Alternative Press&quot;. The inaugural awards show in 2014 was hosted by Mark Hoppus, bassist and vocalist of Blink-182. In 2015, the hosts were Alex Gaskarth and Jack Barakat of All Time Low. In 2016, the show was hosted by Andy Biersack of Black Veil Brides. As of 2022, another event has not been announced.

<doc id="672451" wikidata="Q3073031" url="?curid=672451" title="New Hampshire Fisher Cats">
<text>The New Hampshire Fisher Cats are a Minor League Baseball team based in Manchester, New Hampshire. The team, which plays in the Eastern League, is the Double-A affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball (MLB).

During the team&#x27;s first season in Manchester, the Fisher Cats played at Gill Stadium, a historic ballpark in a residential neighborhood. Starting with the 2005 season, the Fisher Cats have played at Delta Dental Stadium (originally known as Fisher Cats Ballpark, later as Merchantsauto.com Stadium, and then as Northeast Delta Dental Stadium), which is located in Manchester and has a capacity of 6,500.

The Fisher Cats won the Eastern League championship in 2004, their first season in New Hampshire after moving the franchise from New Haven, Connecticut (the franchise won one championship while playing as the New Haven Ravens). They next won the Eastern League championship in 2011, their first season wearing their current red, white, and blue team color scheme, and again in 2018. Overall, the franchise has won four Eastern League championships, three while based in New Hampshire.

==History==
New Haven, Connecticut, along with Portland, Maine, was granted an expansion Double-A franchise on October 3, 1992. The new ballclub was named the New Haven Ravens in January 1993, the result of a contest sponsored by the &quot;New Haven Register&quot;, WELI and WTNH. The Ravens began play in the 1994 season affiliated with the Colorado Rockies. The team hosted the 1998 Double-A All-Star Game, was league runner-up in 1995 and 2003, and won the Eastern League Championship in 2000 with an 82–60 record, defeating the Reading Phillies 3 games to 1 in the championship series. The Ravens played in Yale Field.

The team was sold on January 27, 2003, to Lowell Spinners owner Drew Weber, with the intention of moving the franchise to Manchester, New Hampshire. The Eastern League baseball team owners voted to approve the move during the league playoffs later that same year on September 3. The team&#x27;s first season in Manchester was 2004. The first season was played at Gill Stadium southeast of the downtown area while the current ballpark was under construction.

On July 19, 2005, Drew Weber sold his controlling interest in the team. Art Solomon became the new controlling owner with 60% ownership while Weber retained a 40% ownership share. On July 12, 2008, Solomon purchased full ownership of the Fisher Cats from Weber.

Gary Cathcart was named the team&#x27;s new manager on December 3, 2007; Cathcart had served as the Fisher Cats&#x27; hitting coach during 2005 and 2006, and had most recently managed the single-A Lansing Lugnuts.

On July 16, 2008, the team hosted the 2008 Eastern League All-Star Game and Home Run Derby between the Northern Division and Southern Division. Travis Snider of the Fisher Cats won the Home Run Derby over Luis Montanez of the Bowie Baysox 7–6. In the All-Star Game itself, the Northern Division defeated the Southern Division 5–3 before a Northeast Delta Dental Stadium record crowd of 8,762.

On May 21, 2012, three Fisher Cats pitchers combined to throw the third no-hitter in franchise history, stifling the Portland Sea Dogs in a 6–0 victory at New Hampshire. Combining on the gem for the team were Brett Cecil (5⅔ innings), Danny Farquhar (2⅓), and Ronald Uviedo (1). It was the first no-hitter for New Hampshire since Kyle Drabek hurled a complete-game, nine-inning no-hitter against the New Britain Rock Cats on July 4, .

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Fisher Cats were organized into the Double-A Northeast. In 2022, the Double-A Northeast became known as the Eastern League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

==Origin of current team name==

On November 6, 2003, the new management unveiled the New Hampshire Primaries name and logo, which featured an elephant and a donkey holding baseball bats, and was to be used starting in the 2004 season. The management stated that they felt it reflected a unique aspect of the state, since the New Hampshire primary, held every four years, signifies the start of the presidential election process. Immediately, the name and logo were widely criticized. An online petition was created by two local baseball fans asking the team ownership to reconsider their decision and was covered by local newspapers, radio, and television stations. This coverage was led by a front-page article in the &quot;New Hampshire Union Leader&quot;, New Hampshire&#x27;s largest newspaper, on Sunday November 9, 2003. By the afternoon of November 10, over 1200 unique visitors had signed the petition. Later in the day, the team announced that they would not use the Primaries name after all and that they would seek public opinion on a new name.

On November 13, 2003, the team announced the &quot;Name the Team&quot; contest which had three phases over the following weeks. During the first phase, fans submitted suggestions. During the second phase, fans ranked their top five favorite names from the suggestions. For the final phase, fans voted for their single favorite among the top five names from the second round. On December 3, the final voting results were announced: New Hampshire Fisher Cats (1,574 votes – 24.5%), Manchester Millers (1,552 votes – 24.1%), Granite State Mountain Men (1,382 votes – 21.5%), New Hampshire Granite (1,302 votes – 20.2%), and New Hampshire Primaries (627 votes – 9.7%). The ultimate source of the name is the fisher, often called a fisher cat in New Hampshire. On January 22, 2004, the team unveiled the new set of logos that would be used for the name New Hampshire Fisher Cats. All of the team&#x27;s logos and fonts were created and designed by Studio Simon of Louisville, Kentucky. Team colors were green, black, silver, and bronze.

On August 25, 2007, the Fisher Cats held a &quot;turn back the clock&quot; promotion and played as the New Hampshire Primaries against the Portland Sea Dogs. The Primaries wore specially-designed game worn jerseys for the game. This event would be repeated on July 4, 2008, for a game against the Trenton Thunder, and on July 4, 2009.

On November 28, 2007, the team unveiled a new logo, uniforms, and team colors that were designed by Rickabaugh Graphics of Gahanna, Ohio. The official colors were emerald green, black, white, and silver.

On November 16, 2010, the team colors were changed to red, white and blue, with no other major changes to the logo and uniforms.

In 2021, Manchester&#x27;s minor league baseball team announced it will briefly change its name from the New Hampshire Fisher Cats to the Manchester Chicken Tenders, referencing the city&#x27;s role as the birthplace of the chicken tender.

In December 2023, the team was purchased by Diamond Baseball Holdings.

<doc id="672455" wikidata="Q3381063" url="?curid=672455" title="Reading Fightin Phils">
<text>The Reading Fightin Phils (also called the Reading Fightins) are a Minor League Baseball team based in Reading, Pennsylvania, playing in the Northeast Division of the Eastern League. The team plays their home games at FirstEnergy Stadium. The Reading Fightin Phils were founded in 1967 as the Reading Phillies (commonly referred to as the R-Phils and sometimes Reading Phils) and they have been the Double-A affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies since 1967. This affiliation is currently tied for the longest affiliation in Minor League Baseball. The Phillies bought the team outright in 2008. Many fans still refer to the team as the Reading Phillies or R-Phils.

The franchise has always been based in Reading and maintained its original name &quot;Reading Phillies&quot; from its establishment in 1967 through 2012. The Reading Fightin Phils are the oldest team in the Eastern League to play in their original and current city with the most seasons under their original name (Reading Phillies).

The Fightin Phils&#x27; stadium, FirstEnergy Stadium which was built in 1951 and was previously known as Reading Municipal Memorial Stadium, has been home to the Reading Fightin Phils since their establishment in 1967. The stadium seats 10,000 fans, and on July 3, 2007, the stadium celebrated their ten-millionth fan to attend a game.

The Fightin Phils won the Eastern League championship in 1968, 1973, and 1995, and were co-champions in 2001. The 1983 Phillies were recognized as one of the 100 greatest minor league teams of all time.

==History of baseball in Reading==

===Early baseball in Reading (1858–1932)===
Reading&#x27;s first official baseball team, the Reading Athletic Club, formed in November 1858 and, for the next 15 years, played other local teams for unofficial championships and bragging rights.

The Reading Actives date their existence to 1874. After the National Agreement of 1883, which organized major and minor leagues, the Actives became a member of the Interstate Association, one of the two original minor leagues. The Actives went 33–35 in 1883 against teams from Brooklyn, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Trenton, New Jersey, Wilmington, Delaware, Pottsville, Pennsylvania, and Camden, New Jersey (which disbanded that July), finishing in third place before the league folded after the season.

In 1884 the Active Club became founding members of the Eastern League of Professional Base Ball Clubs. The Actives played sporadically for the next 12 years.

The Reading Coal Heavers played in the Atlantic League from 1897 until the league disbanded in mid-June 1900. During this time, Lizzie Arlington became the first woman to play for a professional men&#x27;s baseball team when she pitched the final inning of a game for the Coal Heavers. Baseball returned to Reading in 1907 when the York White Roses of the Class-B Tri-State League relocated and became the Reading Pretzels. In 1911, the Pretzels finished with the best record in the league, but lost a best-of-seven postseason series to the team from Trenton. On June 14 of that season, George &quot;Jake&quot; Northrop pitched the only perfect nine-inning game in Reading baseball history. The Tri-State League folded after the 1914 season, but the Pretzels were resurrected when the Albany Senators of the New York State League relocated to Reading in August 1916. That league folded at the end of 1917 due to the first World War.

Beginning in 1919, Reading played in the Class-AAA International League with the Reading Coal Barons. Several future major leaguers played for the Reading team, owned by the Chicago Cubs from May 1927 until the end of 1930, including shortstop Bill Jurges and pitcher Lon Warneke. In August 1929, George Quellich set a professional baseball record that still stands today by collecting 15 hits in 15 consecutive at-bats.

===Reading in the Eastern League (1933–1966)===
Reading became home to the Class-A affiliate of the Boston Red Sox in the New York–Penn League (now the Eastern League) in 1933. The Reading Red Sox had a successful two-year run before the team moved to Allentown (this franchise is now defunct).

Five years later, Reading got another baseball franchise—this time, an unaffiliated team in the Class-B Interstate League called the Reading Chicks, which lost the league title series to the Lancaster &quot;Red Roses&quot;. In 1941, the &quot;Chicks&quot; affiliated with the Brooklyn Dodgers as the &quot;Reading Brooks&quot;, featuring future Dodger outfielder Carl Furillo. The franchise folded after the &#x27;41 season, and Reading was without a team for 10 years.

In 1952, the Wilkes-Barre Indians, an affiliate of the Cleveland Indians relocated to Reading to become the Reading Indians. The Reading Indians played at Municipal Memorial Stadium for the next decade, capturing the league title in 1957. Several Indians went on to successful major-league careers, including Rocky Colavito and Roger Maris. The Reading Indians franchise relocated to Charleston, West Virginia in 1961 to become the Charleston Indians, Reading was without professional baseball for that year.

For the 1962 season, the Williamsport Grays moved to Reading and became the second Reading Red Sox team, serving as a Boston Red Sox affiliate for two years, owned by Joe Buzas. The new Reading Red Sox relocated to Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and were renamed Pittsfield Red Sox (this Eastern League franchise was later the New Britain Rock Cats and is now the Hartford Yard Goats).

The Cleveland Indians relocated the Charleston Indians back to Reading after the Reading Red Sox relocated to Pittsfield, the Charleston Indians was once again known as the Reading Indians for one more year before relocating again. Reading was without a baseball team in 1966 before a new Eastern League expansion franchise was established in Reading in 1967 which became known as the Reading Phillies.

===Reading Phillies/Reading Fightin Phils (1967–present)===
The Reading Phillies debuted at Municipal Stadium on April 22, 1967, against the York White Roses.

The Fightin Phils&#x27; affiliation with the &quot;Big Phils&quot; has lasted unbroken since 1967. The Reading Fightin Phils&#x27; relationship with the Philadelphia Phillies was solidified even further when the Philadelphia Phillies purchased the then &quot;Reading Phillies&quot; in 2008. With the end of the 53-year relationship between the Baltimore Orioles and their rookie-league team in Bluefield, West Virginia, after the 2010 season, the Reading/Philadelphia partnership became the longest current affiliation in Minor League Baseball (tied with the Lakeland/Detroit affiliation).

On November 4, 2012, news broke that the Reading Phillies would be changing their name. On November 17, 2012, the team announced that its new name would be the Reading Fightin Phils.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the team was organized into the Double-A Northeast. In 2022, the Double-A Northeast became known as the Eastern League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

==Logos and uniforms==

The team colors of the Reading Fightin Phils are Phillies red, nighttime navy, cream, and white. Their logo consists of a white and gray ostrich outlined in blue with flesh-colored beak and legs putting up his fists in a fighting stance, with the red block &quot;READING&quot; and blue script &quot;Fightin Phils&quot; wordmark right above it. There is also an alternate logo with said ostrich&#x27;s upper body in a blue circle outlined in red, surrounded by a red burst and &quot;READING&quot; and &quot;PENNSYLVANIA&quot; tilted near the top and bottom, respectively.

The Fightin Phils&#x27; home uniforms resemble those of their Philadelphia parent. The caps are navy blue, and feature either a red feathered &quot;R&quot;, or the aforementioned ostrich logo without the wordmarks. The home jerseys are cream and have traditional red pinstripes, but are given a faux-flannel look to the design. In the center is the red &quot;Fightin Phils&quot; wordmark with the player&#x27;s number in red right below it. On the left sleeve is the aforementioned circular alternate logo, with the parent Phillies&#x27; red &quot;P&quot; logo on the right sleeve.

The Fightin Phils&#x27; road uniforms, on the other hand, carry an almost completely different visual identity. That identity&#x27;s primary logo (officially an alternate for the team) consists of a hot dog named &quot;Bunbino&quot; inside a bun with muscular arms and wearing a blue baseball cap, a white jersey with pinstripes, yellow wristbands, and a mustard &quot;B&quot; on the chest. In his right arm, Bunbino squeezes a mustard bottle to form a mustard circle inside the surrounding sky blue circle. Inside the mustard circle but surrounding Bunbino, are the words &quot;READING&quot; and &quot;PENNSYLVANIA&quot; as in the ostrich alternate logo, but in a different yellow font, separated by a mustard stain. The caps are sky blue with Bunbino from the aforementioned logo. Like the home white jersey, the road gray jersey is given a faux-flannel effect; it carries blue piping on the chest and sleeves with a mustard script &quot;Baseballtown&quot; wordmark outlined in sky blue and black, with the player&#x27;s number in sky blue right below it. On the left sleeve is the aforementioned Bunbino primary logo, with the Phillies&#x27; &quot;P&quot; on the right sleeve again.

The Fightin Phils have two alternate uniforms, one home and one away. The home alternate cap is navy blue with a white feathered &quot;F&quot; with an ostrich fist serving as the middle stem. The home alternate jersey is navy blue with white undersleeves, carrying the white &quot;Fightins&quot; feathered script and the player&#x27;s number in white below it; the ostrich is on the left sleeve and the Phillies &quot;P&quot; on the right. The alternate jersey for road and select home games is black with sky blue undersleeves, with the aforementioned &quot;Baseballtown&quot; wordmark on the chest, Bunbino on the left sleeve, and the Phillies &quot;P&quot; on the right. When this jersey is worn on the road, the Fightin Phils will wear a black cap with Bunbino; when at home they will wear a sky blue cap with the mustard &quot;B&quot;.

<text>St. Paul&#x27;s Co-educational College (SPCC; ) is an Anglican secondary school located at 33 MacDonnell Road, Mid-Levels, Hong Kong. It was founded in 1915 as a girls-only school until the outbreak of World War II, after which it was converted into a co-educational school. It is the first school in the Round Square network in Greater China, and offers the HKDSE and IBDP curricula in parallel. It, along with its affiliated primary school, has also been under the Direct Subsidy Scheme since 2001.

==History==

The college was founded in 1915 as St. Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; College (聖保羅女書院) by the Hong Kong Anglican Church. The school&#x27;s motto is &quot;Faith, Hope and Love&quot;, derived from 1 Corinthians 13 of the Bible. 

In 1918, the College was the first school in Hong Kong to require students to wear school uniforms. 

In 1927, the College was moved to 33 MacDonnell Road, and has remained as the location of the school since then.

In 1932, the College adopted the school badge that is still used now.

Amidst the outbreak of the Second World War and Japanese occupation of Hong Kong in 1942, the College suspended all operations. In 1945, the College resumed operation while St. Paul&#x27;s Boys&#x27; College moved in. Since then, the College began to accept both boys and girls, and became the first co-educational school in Hong Kong. As the College transformed from a girls school to a co-educational school, a whole-day primary school was established, and Mr Maak Ying Kei was appointed as the Headteacher of the primary school.

When St. Paul&#x27;s Boys&#x27; College moved back to their campus in Bonham Road in 1950, the school continued to accept both boys and girls, remaining co-educational. Before the primary school changed into an AM and PM school in 1957, it moved to 1 Calder Path. The position of Headteacher in the PM primary school was taken up by Ms Fok Lan Hing. In 1959, the new west wing of the College was completed as part of the secondary school.

In October 1969, the school established their first aid service for boys, the St Paul&#x27;s Ambulance Cadet Division under Hong Kong St John Ambulance. A Nursing division for girls was later set up.

== Exam results ==
St. Paul&#x27;s Co-educational College has produced 13 perfect scorers &quot;10As&quot; in the history of Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination (HKCEE) and 19 &quot;Top Scorers&quot; and &quot;Super Top Scorers&quot; in Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination (HKDSE).

7 x 5** &quot;Top Scorers&quot; are candidates who obtained perfect scores of 5** in each of the four core subjects and three electives.

8 x 5** &quot;Super Top Scorers&quot; are candidates who obtained seven Level 5** in four core subjects and three electives, and an additional Level 5** in the Mathematics Extended (M1/M2) module.

<text>In computer science, a graph-structured stack (GSS) is a directed acyclic graph where each directed path represents a stack.
The graph-structured stack is an essential part of Tomita&#x27;s algorithm, where it replaces the usual stack of a pushdown automaton. This allows the algorithm to encode the nondeterministic choices in parsing an ambiguous grammar, sometimes with greater efficiency. 

In the following diagram, there are four stacks: {7,3,1,0}, {7,4,1,0}, {7,5,2,0}, and {8,6,2,0}.

Another way to simulate nondeterminism would be to duplicate the stack as needed. The duplication would be less efficient since vertices would not be shared. For this example, 16 vertices would be needed instead of 9.

==Operations==
GSSnode* GSS::add(GSSnode* prev, int elem)
 int prevlevel = prev-&gt;level;
 assert(levels.size() &gt;= prevlevel + 1);
 int level = prevlevel + 1;
 if (levels.size() == level)
 levels.resize(level + 1);
 GSSnode* node = findElemAtLevel(level, elem);
 if (node == nullptr)
 node = new GSSnode();
 node-&gt;elem = elem;
 node-&gt;level = level; 
 levels[level].push_back(node);
 node-&gt;add(prev);
 return node;

void GSS::remove(GSSnode* node)
 if (levels.size() &gt; node-&gt;level + 1)
 if (findPrevAtLevel(node-&gt;level + 1, node)) throw Exception(&quot;Can remove only from top.&quot;);
 for (int i = 0; i &lt; levels[node-&gt;level].size(); i++)
 if (levels[node-&gt;level][i] == node)
 levels[node-&gt;level].erase(levels[node-&gt;level].begin() + i);
 break;
 delete node;

<text>The Birmingham Barons are a Minor League Baseball team based in Birmingham, Alabama. The team, which plays in the Southern League, is the Double-A affiliate of the Chicago White Sox and plays at Regions Field in downtown Birmingham. The Barons were previously located in Montgomery, Alabama, and known as the Montgomery Rebels.

==History==
Most of the professional baseball teams that have played in Birmingham have used the name Barons. The current team began playing in Birmingham in 1981, having previously played in Montgomery, Alabama as the Montgomery Rebels. Like previous Barons teams, they played at Rickwood Field on a full-time basis from 1981 to 1987. Since then, they have only played at Rickwood on special occasions. From 1988 to 2012, the team played at Hoover Metropolitan Stadium in the suburb of Hoover, Alabama, where former basketball star Michael Jordan played with the team in . Since 2013, the team plays at Regions Field in the downtown part of Birmingham.

As a result of Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Barons were organized into the eight-team Double-A South. In 2022, the Double-A South became known as the Southern League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

In 2023, Diamond Baseball Holdings purchased the team from The Logan Family.

==Playoffs and championships==
* Southern League playoff appearances (17): 1983, 1987, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1993, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2024
* Southern League championships (7): 1983, 1987, 1989, 1993, 2002, 2013, 2024
* Dixie Series championships (6): 1929, 1931, 1948, 1951, 1958, 1967

==Television and radio==
All Birmingham Barons games are televised live on MiLB.TV. All games are also broadcast on radio on either WJQX 100.5 FM, WJOX-FM 94.5 FM or WJOX-AM 690 AM. Birmingham Barons Hall-of-Fame broadcaster Curt Bloom is the broadcast commentator for both WERC and MiLB.TV and has been the voice of the Barons since 1992.

<text>Yamit () was an Israeli settlement in the northern part of the Sinai Peninsula with a population of about 2,500 people. Yamit was established during Israel&#x27;s occupation of the peninsula from the end of the 1967 Six-Day War until that part of the Sinai was handed over to Egypt in April 1982, as part of the terms of the 1979 Egypt–Israel peace treaty. Prior to the return of the land to Egypt, all the homes were evacuated and bulldozed.

==History==
Located in the Rafah Plain region south of the Gaza Strip, Yamit was envisioned as a large city for 200,000 people that would create a buffer zone between the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula. It was built on land in a 140,000 dunam (14,000 hectare) area from which some 1,500 Bedouin families of the Al-Ramilat tribes had been secretly expelled under the direct orders of the then-defense minister Moshe Dayan and Southern Command head Ariel Sharon. Construction of Yamit began in January 1975. When the first fifty residents arrived there were no buildings, roads, electricity or water. Nevertheless, ambitious plans were drawn up for a port, a flour mill, a Dead Sea canal, a hotel and a university. A cornerstone was laid for a yeshiva. By the second year, the population reached 100.

Despite efforts to promote Yamit&#x27;s relatively affordable housing, Yamit did not attract enough residents to make it a seaport. Upon the signing of the peace treaty with Egypt in 1979, it became clear to residents that Yamit&#x27;s days were numbered. Most accepted compensation and relocated to other cities. Those who chose to stay were joined by nationalist supporters who moved in to boost their numbers. When the order came to evacuate Yamit by force, many of the residents barricaded themselves inside their homes, while others climbed up to their roofs as soldiers broke down their doors.

Before the establishment of Yamit, the area south of Gaza known as the Rafah salient had been home to Bedouin farmers who &quot;tended almond, peach, olive, and castor-oil trees and patches of wheat. Near the coastline, where groundwater rose almost to the surface, they farmed a strip a few hundred meters wide that yielded richer crops. Herds of sheep and goats added to their livelihood. They were settled tribes; some lived in tents, but more in tin shacks and concrete houses&#x27;.

===Expulsion of the Bedouin===
On January 14, 1972, without explicit instructions by the Israeli government, Ariel Sharon ordered the expulsion of the Bedouins of the Rafah Plain, about of land in northeast Sinai, together with the razing of their orchards and the blocking of their water wells. The tribal sheikhs claimed 20,000 people were affected by the expulsion. Israeli army statistics put the number of expelled at 4,950. Those with tents were given a day to remove them. Those in concrete houses were given an extra day to leave, and their homes were reduced to rubble. Bulldozers, following a map design drawn by Sharon, drove down a swathe extending several dozen metres wide where the Bedouins were encamped and smashed everything in their way. The decision to build Yamit was approved by the Israeli government in September 1973.

Settling northeastern Sinai was an idea strongly promoted by Moshe Dayan. The idea was subsequently proposed in a document on Israeli policy in the occupied territories written by Yisrael Galili, drafted to bridge the gap between hardliners and moderates in the Israeli Labour Party. According to one Israeli kibbutznik who visited the area immediately after the expulsion:
The expulsion was not mentioned in the Israeli press. A month later, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross met and raised the issue with Dayan&#x27;s viceroy in the territories, Shlomo Gazit, who knew nothing of it. The IDF chief of staff David Elazar, on being informed, flew over the area by helicopter to see for himself and subsequently appointed a commission to investigate what Ariel Sharon had done.

The subsequent inquiry revealed that the expulsion of the Bedouins had occurred under Dayan&#x27;s initiative and without government authorization. Golda Meir&#x27;s government implemented the pre-prepared plan for settlements on this Bedouin territory. According to one source, it was this official decision to establish a large Israeli city at Yamit which, for Anwar Sadat and senior Egyptian officials, &quot;was the straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back&quot;, eventuating in the loss of hopes for a peace agreement and the onset of the Yom Kippur War. Avi Shlaim argues however that the Arab decision to go to war preceded the Galilee Document&#x27;s publication. Nonetheless, Dayan made public remarks about his intention to build a deep-water port at Yamit, cutting Egypt off from the Gaza Strip, and Sadat is on record as saying, &quot;Every word spoken about Yamit is a knife pointing at me personally and at my self-respect.&quot;

Local kibbutzniks were outraged by the destruction and, in consultation with the tribal chief, Suleiman Hussein Uda Abu Hilo, arranged for a human rights lawyer to appeal on their behalf. Some kibbutzniks, among them Oded Lifshitz, and Latif Dori, were also activists in the left-wing Mapam party and ran &quot;Rafiah tours&quot; to show Israelis the destruction that had taken place, and to bring to public attention the fact that the image of the Bedouin as nomads were inexact, and that their orchards were being bulldozed. In July 1972, nine Bedouin sheikhs from the area petitioned the Supreme Court of Israel to obtain an order permitting them to return to their homes. Their case was presented by a Mapam man, Haim Holzman, who argued that the evacuation had no legal or military rationale, and violated the Geneva Convention. Ariel Sharon was ordered by the court to show cause for the expulsion. General Israel Tal gave a deposition arguing that the Rafiah Plain area had been used by terrorists, who had attacked Israelis, as a shelter. A buffer zone, involving &quot;Jewish settlement and presence&quot; between Egypt and the Gaza Strip, was required for security reasons. Holzmann replied, arguing that Tal&#x27;s maps showed terrorist attacks had been in decline, and the incidents enumerated lay outside the zone where the expulsion had taken place. Holzmann died of a heart attack before his summation, later given by his law partner, could be delivered. While the case was still pending, Dayan secretly asked Tel Aviv architects Yehuda Drexler and Ze&#x27;ev Drukman to draw up a blueprint for the projected port town of Yamit. The design brochure they produced was then sequestered by the IDF to ensure that the material would not come to the court&#x27;s attention.

Dayan envisaged a metropolis whose population would be expanded to a quarter of a million people by the year 2000. His plan was shelved because its cost would have had serious consequences for Israel&#x27;s poor. The first residents arrived in August 1975 and the population quickly expanded. Two settlement blocs surrounded it: to the east lay Pri&#x27;el, Talme Yosef, Netiv, Ha-Asara, Ugda, Nir Avraham, Prigan, Sadot, Diqua, and the block centre Avshalom, while south of Yamit, settlements were made at Atzmona, Tarsag and Ne&#x27;ot Sinai. Most of the population was composed of secular Israelis who were attracted to the pristine settings near the Mediterranean and the low cost of housing. The settlement was positioned about half a kilometre away from the shore, adjacent to Bedouins who lived nearby along the shoreline itself.

==Evacuation==
The evacuation of Yamit was part of the final stage of Israeli evacuation from Sinai. It was carried out in the face of powerful domestic opposition in Israel. Moshe Arens (of the Likud party), the head of the Knesset&#x27;s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, and professor Yuval Ne&#x27;eman, the leader of the right-wing Tehiya party, led that opposition. They wanted to stop the evacuation and revoke the peace treaty with Egypt, arguing, that once Egypt had the entire Sinai, it would cancel the peace treaty with Israel and rejoin the rest of the Arab world.
Yamit was evacuated on April 23, 1982, amid resistance by some Yamit settlers and other supporters. Some residents barricaded themselves on the rooftops before being dragged into buses by Israeli soldiers. Political extremists from the rest of the country infiltrated Yamit to demonstrate their solidarity and sabotage the withdrawal. Among the more extreme examples of resistance were the disciples of Rabbi Meir Kahane, who vowed to take their own lives rather than surrender. After the personal intervention of Kahane, they agreed to leave.

The initial agreement between Israel and Egypt stipulated that Egypt would pay for the houses and infrastructure of Yamit. Ariel Sharon decided to destroy the settlement. Sharon claimed that he decided in response to an Egyptian request, but this was not the case. According to the Israeli ambassador to Egypt at the time, Moshe Sasson, Begin feared that the Israeli settlers would return to their homes surreptitiously and that a disastrous clash between them and the Egyptians might occur. One suggestion was that Sharon deliberately made the whole process more traumatic than it needed to be so that the Israeli public would refuse the dismantling of other settlements even for the sake of peace.

Since the demolition, the only structure that remains visible is the skeleton of the main synagogue, which contains no visible Jewish symbols.

They previously played at Engel Stadium from 1930 through 1999, with a one-year break in Montgomery, Alabama&#x27;s Cramton Bowl in 1943.

==History==
In 1908, Oliver Burnside &quot;O.B.&quot; Andrews, owner of the Andrews Paper Box Company, Garnett Carter, and a third unidentified party took ownership of a franchise in the South Atlantic League relocating the Single-A team to Chattanooga. The team adopted the name Lookouts in 1909 after a fan contest. The following year Andrews purchased the Double A Southern Association franchise from Little Rock and relocated them to Chattanooga. The team began playing on Andrews Field in the 1100 block of East 3rd Street, which would remain the site of their home stadium for close to a hundred years.

Joe Engel bought the Chattanooga Lookouts in 1926 and opened Engel Stadium in 1930 on the site of Andrews Field. The first game in the new stadium was played April 15, 1930, with the Lookouts beating the Atlanta Crackers 6-5 in front of approx. 16,000 fans.

In 1931, the New York Yankees played an exhibition game against the Lookouts. During the game, a 17-year-old girl named Jackie Mitchell pitched for the Lookouts and struck out Major League greats Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth. Many reports of this story include a footnote claiming that a few days after the game, baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis voided Mitchell&#x27;s contract, claiming that baseball was &quot;too strenuous&quot; for women. This has been rebutted here, and directly contradicts a profile of Mitchell published a few months later. MLB didn&#x27;t introduce a ban on contracts for female players until June 21, 1952 (which was repealed in 1992).

After winning the 1932 Southern Association pennant, the Lookouts won the Dixie Series, a postseason interleague championship between the champions of the Southern Association and the Texas League, defeating the Beaumont Exporters, 4–1, in the best-of-seven series.

During owner Joe Engel&#x27;s tenure, the Lookouts won four championships – three with the Southern Association and a fourth with the South Atlantic League. Engel led a charge to own the Lookouts privately, with the help of several hundred fans as shareholders from 1938 to 1942. In 1939, as a privately owned franchise under coach Kiki Cuyler, the Lookouts claimed a championship. In 1943, the Lookouts played at Montgomery, Alabama&#x27;s Cramton Bowl as the &quot;Montgomery Rebels&quot; after the Washington Senators moved the Lookouts from Chattanooga to Montgomery, some away, citing a decline in attendance. (The original Montgomery Rebels team had folded due to World War II in 1943 and would return to Montgomery in 1946 in the now-defunct Southeastern League.) The Lookouts managed to move back to Chattanooga in December of that year after Engel organized a letter-writing campaign aimed at Clark Griffith, the owner of the Senators at the time.

The team, which plays in the Southern League, has been the Double-A affiliate of a major league ballclub since 1932. From 1988 through 2008, the Lookouts were the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds. For the 2009 through 2014 seasons, the Los Angeles Dodgers served as the parent club. In affiliating with the Twins in 2015, the Lookouts rekindled a relationship with the franchise that, as the 1901–1960 edition of the Washington Senators, spent the longest period as its parent team.

It was announced on September 25, 2018, that the Lookouts would resume their affiliation with the Reds.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Lookouts were organized into the Double-A South in which they continued as an affiliate of the Reds. In 2022, the Double-A South became known as the Southern League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

On July 15, 2024, the team and local officials broke ground on a new $115 million stadium in the South Broad Street area. The stadium will be constructed on the site of the former U.S. Pipe/Wheland Foundry. The stadium will be flanked by I-24 as it runs along Nickajack Lake. 

==Television and radio==
All Chattanooga Lookouts games are televised on MiLB.TV. Since 2016, all games are broadcast on 96.1 The Legend. Larry Ward is the lead broadcaster. Lookouts games were broadcast on WDOD (1310 AM) until the 2011 season. From 2011 to 2015, games were broadcast on WALV-FM (105.1 FM, &quot;ESPN Chattanooga&quot;). Currently, all Lookouts games are broadcast on WLND 98.1 The Lake starting with the 2019 season.

<doc id="672533" wikidata="Q13414538" url="?curid=672533" title="Mobile BayBears">
<text>The Mobile BayBears were a Minor League Baseball team based in Mobile, Alabama, United States. The team, which played in the Southern League, served as the Double-A affiliate of the San Diego Padres (1997–2006), Arizona Diamondbacks (2007–2016), and Los Angeles Angels (2017–2019). The BayBears played in Hank Aaron Stadium, which opened in 1997 and is named after baseball&#x27;s former all-time home run king and Mobile native Hank Aaron.

In 2020, the BayBears relocated to Madison, Alabama, where they are now called the Rocket City Trash Pandas.

==History==
The BayBears franchise originated in 1976 in Charlotte, North Carolina, first as the Charlotte Orioles and then as the first incarnation of the Charlotte Knights. When Charlotte moved up to become a Triple-A franchise in 1993, the team found a temporary home in Nashville, Tennessee, as the Nashville Xpress from 1993 to 1994. It existed as the Port City Roosters in Wilmington, North Carolina, from 1995 to 1996. The franchise landed in Mobile in 1997.

The team&#x27;s name was announced in July 1996, having been selected in a name-the-team contest. Mobile mayor Mike Dow announced the name at that year&#x27;s Mobile Fourth of July fireworks display. In September 1996, the BayBears signed an affiliation agreement with the San Diego Padres.

In November 2017, BayBears owners Michael Savit and HWS Group, closed on the sale of the team to BallCorps LLC. The team continued to play in Mobile through the 2019 season, but relocated to Madison, Alabama, in 2020, where they were planned to play in a newly-built ballpark. Upon relocation, the team was renamed the Rocket City Trash Pandas. The name is a reference to both the area&#x27;s association with the space industry and the determination and ingenuity of raccoons.

The BayBears played their final game on September 2, 2019. They were defeated by the Tennessee Smokies, 5–4, before a crowd of 1,554 people.

<doc id="672535" wikidata="Q3487037" url="?curid=672535" title="Knoxville Smokies">
<text>The Knoxville Smokies are a Minor League Baseball team based in Knoxville, Tennessee. The team, which plays in the Southern League, is the Double-A affiliate of the Chicago Cubs. The team was based in Kodak, Tennessee, a Knoxville suburb, from 2000 to 2024 as the &quot;Tennessee Smokies&quot; at Smokies Stadium. The team will move into the new Covenant Health Park in Knoxville in 2025. The team&#x27;s nickname refers to the Great Smoky Mountains which permeate the region; mountains in the chain are often clouded in a hazy mist that may appear as smoke rising from the forest.

==History==
===Prior professional baseball in Knoxville===
Knoxville has hosted Minor League Baseball teams since the late 19th century. The city&#x27;s professional baseball history dates back to 1896 with the formation of the Knoxville Indians who played two seasons in the Southeastern League. They were followed by the Knoxville Reds (1902–1905). In 1904, the Reds won the city&#x27;s first professional championship in the Tennessee–Alabama League. The Knoxville Appalachians began play in 1909 as members of the original Class B South Atlantic League. They dropped out of the &quot;Sally League&quot; that season, but continued in the Class D Southeastern League (1910) and Appalachian League (1911–1914). The Appalachians adopted the Reds moniker from the previous Knoxville team in 1912.

The club returned to the South Atlantic loop, now Class B, as the Smokies from 1925 to 1929. On July 22, 1931, the Mobile Bears franchise of the A1 Southern Association moved to Knoxville and played as the Smokies through July 5, 1944, when the club returned to Mobile. The transfer marked the end of Knoxville&#x27;s membership in the Southern Association.

In 1946, the Smokies joined the Class B Tri-State League and played in it until the loop folded in 1955. But in July 1956, when the Montgomery Rebels of the Class A South Atlantic League needed a new home, they transferred to Knoxville. The Smokies&#x27; manager that season was Earl Weaver who was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1996.

===Double-A===

The Smokies were reclassified as Double-A with the rest of the Sally League in 1963, and were charter members of the Sally&#x27;s successor, the Southern League, in 1964. Apart from a four-year (1968–1971) hiatus, they have continued in the Southern loop ever since.

Knoxville returned in 1972 as the Knoxville White Sox or Knox Sox, the Chicago White Sox&#x27;s Double-A club. They transferred their affiliation to the Toronto Blue Jays in 1980, a link that lasted until 1999. For the first 13 of those years, the team was officially known as the Knoxville Blue Jays, or locally referred to as simply the K-Jays. The historic Smokies moniker was reintroduced beginning in the 1993 season.

From 1954 to 1999, Knoxville baseball teams played in Bill Meyer Stadium, formerly known as Knoxville Municipal Stadium, on Neal Ridley Field. The stadium was named for Knoxville native son and former Pittsburgh Pirates manager Billy Meyer. The field was named in memory of Neal Ridley, a former team owner, in 1984, following his death the previous year.

From 1999 to 2005, the Smokies were the Double-A affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals. However, when the Cardinals purchased the El Paso Diablos, which had been the Arizona Diamondbacks&#x27; Double-A affiliate, the Diamondbacks retained the Smokies as their new Double-A affiliate. On September 21, 2006, the Chicago Cubs, who had previously had a Double-A affiliation with division rival West Tenn Diamond Jaxx, reached a two-year player development contract with the Smokies through the 2008 season.

====Chicago Cubs (2007–present)====

In December 2008, Hall of Famer and former Chicago Cubs All-Star second baseman Ryne Sandberg was named manager for the 2009 season. Sandberg led the Smokies to a second-half Southern League North Division crown and a 3–1 divisional playoff series win over the Huntsville Stars. The Smokies would eventually fall 3-games-to-1 to the Jacksonville Suns for the 2009 Southern League Championship.

In June 2013, the then-Smokies&#x27; ownership group, led by Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam, sold the team to Randy Boyd, a local Knoxville businessman. Though a devoted baseball fan, Boyd is not involved in the day-to-day management of the team, delegating those responsibilities to CEO Doug Kirchhofer and General Manager Brian Cox. In 2016, speculation began that Boyd was wanting to move the Smokies back to Knoxville after he had purchased several parcels in downtown Knoxville. Boyd said he had envisioned a baseball stadium on that site, but at that time had no plans to bring the baseball team back to Knoxville until 2025, when the current stadium contract expires.

On July 11, 2014, The Chicago Cubs and Tennessee Smokies announced an extension to their Player Development Contract (PDC) for the maximum possible term of four years. The agreement meant the Smokies were to remain the Cubs&#x27; Double-A affiliate through the 2018 season.

On October 22, 2014, the Smokies revealed new logos, colors, and uniforms that reflected their ongoing relationship with the Chicago Cubs organization.

Smokies Stadium experienced its largest baseball attendance ever of 7,958 on May 13, 2017, against the Montgomery Biscuits. The Smokies lost the game 3–1, which was also &quot;Star Wars&quot; Night. The previous attendance record was the 7,866 on July 24, 2015, against the Chattanooga Lookouts. The Smokies won the game 8–4, which was also &quot;Toy Story&quot; Night and Daddy-Daughter Date Night.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Smokies were organized into the Double-A South. In 2022, the Double-A South became known as the Southern League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

In 2021, Tennessee Smokies owner Randy Boyd announced that the team would be moving back to Knoxville in a new stadium built in the Old City neighborhood, with the plans to play at the new stadium in 2024. It was announced the team would revive its former name of the Knoxville Smokies upon the move.

The 2022 Smokies qualified for the Southern League playoffs by virtue of having the second-best full-season record in the Northern Division behind the Rocket City Trash Pandas, who won both halves of the season. Tennessee defeated Rocket City, 2–1, to win the Northern Division title and advance to the finals against the Pensacola Blue Wahoos.

==Season-by-season results==

<text>Bill McBirnie is a Juno Award-nominated and widely acclaimed jazz/Latin flautist, based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He was raised in the small town of Port Colborne, Ontario, Canada.

==Career==
He studied with Canadian flautist and composer Robert Aitken, American classical flautist Samuel Baron, and Cuban charanga legend Richard Egües. 

He has recorded several albums under his own name. He has also recorded extensively as a sideman, including with Junior Mance, Irakere, Four80East, Memo Acevedo, and Emilie-Claire Barlow.

In an educational vein, he has been a longstanding contributor to the Woodwinds Column of the Canadian Musician magazine and, in addition, he was recruited personally by Sir James Galway to serve as his resident Jazz Flute Specialist. He is also author of the book, &quot;The Technique and Theory of Improvisation: A practical guide for flutists, doublers, and other instrumentalists&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
&quot;The Silent Wish&quot; (with Bernie Senensky), was nominated for a Juno Award as Best Instrumental Album of the Year in 2020.

McBirnie was featured with Four80East in the #1 Billboard magazine Smooth Jazz hit, &quot;Cinco Cinco Seis&quot;, in 2019. He was again featured by Four80East in the subsequent Billboard magazine hit, &quot;Ba Ba Brazil&quot;, in 2020.

&quot;Find You Place&quot; won the Vox Pop award in the Jazz Instrumental category at the 14th Annual Independent Music Awards (IMAs) in the US in 2016.

&quot;Grain of Sand&quot; (with Bruce Jones) won the Best Instrumental album category at the Toronto Independent Music Awards in 2016.

The venerable American flute maker, William S. Haynes Flute Company, designated McBirnie a Haynes Artist in 2013.

&quot;Mercy&quot; (featuring Romani pianist, Robi Botos) was nominated in the Best Jazz Album category at the Independent Music Awards (IMAs) in the US in 2011.

McBirnie was named Flutist of the Year by the Jazz Report Awards in 1999, and nominated as both Miscellaneous Instrumentalist of the Year and Best Album for &quot;Paco Paco&quot; at the National Jazz Awards in 2007.

McBirnie was solicited personally by Sir James Galway to serve as the resident Jazz Flute Specialist at his official website in 2005.

He is the only flutist to have won all three of the US National Flute Association&#x27;s jazz flute Masterclass (2003), Big Band (2009) and Soloist (2012) Competitions.

<doc id="672539" wikidata="Q17042680" url="?curid=672539" title="Orlando Rays">
<text>The Orlando &quot;Rays&quot; and several different minor league baseball teams have called the city of Orlando, Florida home between 1919 and 2003. Most have played in the Florida State League.

==History==

The original Orlando franchise played between 1919 and 1924 and was alternately called the Caps, Tigers and Bulldogs. The Orlando Colts played between 1926 and 1928.

The Orlando Gulls began in 1937 but changed their name the following year to the Orlando Senators when they became an affiliate of the Washington Senators. The Senators remained through 1955 (though the team name and league was shut down from 1943–1945 during World War II and the name was changed to the Orlando C.B.s for 1954–1955). They won the FSL championship in 1940, 1946 and 1955

In 1956, they were an affiliate of the Diablos Rojos del Mexico of the Mexican League and were known as the Orlando Seratomas. As an affiliate of the Detroit Tigers they were the Orlando Flyers in 1957, a name that remained in 1958 when they were affiliated with the International League team, the Toronto Maple Leafs. They were a Los Angeles Dodgers affiliate known as the Orlando Dodgers from 1959–1961 when this version of the team was discontinued.

The last incarnation of the franchise began in 1963, when the Minnesota Twins (the former Senators) set up a new affiliate called the Orlando Twins. The franchise moved up to the Double-A Southern League in 1973. The Twins played at Tinker Field in downtown Orlando, near the Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium. In 1990, the team was renamed the Orlando Sun Rays. In 1993, the Chicago Cubs became the team&#x27;s new major-league affiliate, and the team was renamed the Orlando Cubs. While still a Chicago Cubs affiliate, the team renamed itself once again in 1997 and became the Orlando Rays. The following year, for one season only, the Seattle Mariners were the Rays&#x27; major-league affiliate. The Tampa Bay Rays (then the Devil Rays), an American League expansion team in 1998, assumed the Orlando Rays&#x27; major-league affiliation the following year.

The Orlando Rays&#x27; last season at Tinker Field was 1999. From 2000 to 2003, the Orlando Rays played in Kissimmee, Florida, in Champion Stadium at Walt Disney World Resort. Despite the fact that the team played in a state-of-the-art stadium that was built in 1997 and used during spring training by the Atlanta Braves, attendance did not meet expectations; after trailing the Southern League in attendance in multiple years, the Rays&#x27; owners announced the team would move to Montgomery, Alabama in 2004 (terminating their 10-year lease with Disney after four seasons). Rays players who went on to the major-league level include Carl Crawford, Toby Hall, Trevor Enders, Jorge Cantú, Dewon Brazelton, Chad Gaudin, Matt Diaz, Jonny Gomes, B.J. Upton and Seth McClung. The team is now known as the Montgomery Biscuits.

The Gulf Coast Braves also previously played in Orlando.

==Post franchise events==
On June 17, 2016 as part of a charity appeal following the Orlando nightclub shooting, the Tampa Bay Rays wore Orlando Rays caps during their game against the San Francisco Giants. The team also wore Orlando Rays caps in a spring training game on February 28, 2023, while playing home games at the Disney World&#x27;s ESPN Wide World of Sports.

<text>The Springfield Cardinals are a Minor League Baseball team based in Springfield, Missouri. They are members of the Texas League&#x27;s North Division and serve as the Double-A affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals. The Springfield Cardinals began play in 2005. Since its inception, the team&#x27;s home venue has been Hammons Field.

The Springfield Cardinals won three Texas League North 1st Half Division titles, two Texas League North 2nd Half Division titles, two Texas League North championships and one Texas League championship (2012). Through the 2020 season, a total of 114 former Springfield Cardinals have gone on to make their Major League debut with St. Louis with an additional 27 others debuting with different MLB teams.

Previously, the St. Louis Cardinals&#x27; Double-A affiliate was the Tennessee Smokies, located near Sevierville, Tennessee. The Springfield Cardinals&#x27; Texas League North rivals are the Arkansas Travelers (Seattle Mariners), Northwest Arkansas Naturals (Kansas City Royals), Tulsa Drillers (Los Angeles Dodgers), and Wichita Wind Surge (Minnesota Twins).

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Cardinals were organized into the Double-A Central. In 2022, the Double-A Central became known as the Texas League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

On May 1, 2023, the Springfield Cardinals were sold by the St. Louis Cardinals to Diamond Baseball Holdings.

== The original Springfield Cardinals ==
Springfield, Missouri, has hosted professional baseball teams since as early as 1905, when the Springfield Highlanders began play. For nearly 30 years, the team was variously called the Highlanders, Jobbers, Midgets, and Merchants. There were several years when no team existed at all.

In 1931, the St. Louis Cardinals purchased a minor league team, renamed it the Cardinals, and relocated it in Springfield. That year, the team won the first of several Western Association titles. With a front office led by future Hall of Famer Branch Rickey, Springfield also went to the playoffs in 1931, 1932, 1934, 1935, 1937, 1938, 1939, and 1941, and won league titles in 1931, 1932, 1934, 1937, and 1939.

Following the 1946 season, St. Louis moved the team to St. Joseph, Missouri, where it remained until 1953. The city of Springfield saw a brief re-emergence of minor league baseball when the rival Chicago Cubs moved its affiliate to Springfield for one season taking the name Springfield Cubs.

Though there was a gap of 63 years, most in the Springfield and St. Louis organizations consider the current Cardinals the same group which existed in 1932. Many pieces of fan apparel actually say &quot;Springfield Cardinals circa 1932.&quot; The deck on top of the Cardinals dugout also has the championship banners from the 1930s and 1940s.

==Previous franchise history==
The current Cardinals are a relatively new team, dating back to just 2005. Previous to this, they were known as the El Paso Diablos. That team&#x27;s owners sold the franchise to the St. Louis Cardinals and were then moved to Springfield as part of their minor league system.

The previous Double-A affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals was the Tennessee Smokies in 2003 and 2004.

Springfield has also been the home of various other non-affiliated minor league clubs including the Springfield Highlander (1905), Jobbers (1911), Merchants (1920), Springfield Midgets (1906-1909, 1921–1929; the 1930 club being affiliated with the St. Louis Browns) and the Red Wings (1931). These former teams were generally Class C ball clubs in the former Western Association.

==2012 season==
The Cardinals’ most successful season has been the 2012 campaign, during which they finished first in the North Division in second half of the season, posted a division-best and franchise mark with a 77–61 record, and won the Texas League Championship. They went on to defeat the Tulsa Drillers 3–2 in the best-of-five divisional playoff series, advancing to the 2012 Texas League Championship Series, their second in franchise history. Springfield defeated the Frisco RoughRiders three games to one in the best-of-five Championship Series. Key players included Kolten Wong, Jermaine Curtis, Carlos Martinez, Trevor Rosenthal, Vance Albitz, Oscar Taveras, and Xavier Scruggs.

== Hammons Field ==

The Springfield Cardinals play at Hammons Field. It is located in Springfield, Missouri, and has a capacity of 7,986 plus approximately 2,500 general admission seating.

== Mascots ==
The Springfield Cardinals have two mascots. Their first and main mascot is a brightly colored red bird named Louie. He has been a mascot for the team since its formation in 2005. He is the &quot;little brother&quot; of Fredbird, the mascot of the MLB&#x27;s St. Louis Cardinals. Their second mascot is a fluffy dog named Fetch. He is a fluffy beagle received by Louie as a birthday gift on Opening Day in 2006. During home games they can be found entertaining fans by tossing t-shirts and taking photos. When the team is on the road, Louie and Fetch attend local events in the community.

==Roster==
== Notable alumni ==

Springfield played host to several players that would go on to play in Major League Baseball. Stan Musial played 87 games for Springfield during the 1941 season, batting .379 and quickly becoming a fan favorite. In April 2005, Musial threw out the ceremonial first pitch and played his harmonica to the tune of &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; to a crowd of nearly 12,000 during the inaugural St. Louis vs. Springfield Cardinals game. Among other players to come through Springfield are Dizzy Dean and his brother Paul, Pepper Martin, and Joe Medwick.

<text>The Arkansas Travelers, also known informally as The Travs, are a Minor League Baseball team based in North Little Rock, Arkansas. The Travelers are the Double-A affiliate of the Seattle Mariners, and are members of the Texas League.

==History==
The team succeeded the Double-A Little Rock Travelers of the Southern Association, which folded after the 1961 season. They returned as the Arkansas Travelers of the International League in 1963. Both versions of the name derive from the old folk song, &quot;The Arkansas Traveler&quot;. The Travelers never took another nickname and possess the third-longest running nickname in minor league baseball history behind the Buffalo Bisons and Indianapolis Indians. 

=== Affiliations ===
After the end of the Southern Association in 1961, the Travelers were given the opportunity to move up becoming the Philadelphia Phillies&#x27; Triple-A affiliate for first the International League (1963) and then the Pacific Coast League (1964–1965). However, in 1966 the Travelers moved down to the Texas League as the St. Louis Cardinals&#x27; Double-A affiliate through 2000. This marked the most successful period for the Travelers as they won the Texas League championship in 1971, 1977, 1979, 1980, and 1989. After serving 35 years as a Cardinals&#x27; affiliate, the Travelers became the Los Angeles Angels&#x27; Double-A affiliate in 2001; this ended the second-longest active affiliation at the time. The Travelers remained with the Angels through 2016, winning the Texas League championship in 2001 and 2008. In 2017, the Travelers entered into a new Player Development Contract, becoming the Double-A affiliate of the Seattle Mariners; this move marked just the second time in the last half century that the Travelers swapped major league teams. The 2018 season marked the Arkansas Travelers&#x27; 53rd season as a part of the Texas League, making them the longest tenured active member of the league.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Travelers were organized into the Double-A Central. In 2022, the Double-A Central became known as the Texas League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

==Ballparks==

===Ray Winder Field===
From 1932 to 2006, the Travelers played at Ray Winder Field. Bill Valentine, a former American League umpire and chosen as general manager for the Travelers from 1976 to 2007, began to promote the historic nature of Ray Winder Field. The ballpark gained recognition as one of the oldest still active parks in minor league baseball, and fans traveled to Little Rock to experience the nostalgia and sample the baseball history represented by Ray Winder Field. However, after nearly three-quarters of a century, the field was showing signs of age and after a successful special election in 2005, the team moved to a new stadium at the start of the 2007 season and the field was demolished in 2012. In 1991, the field saw the largest crowd to watch a baseball game in Arkansas history as Ray Winder played host to about 12,000 people; the crowd had come from all over to see Fernando Valenzuela&#x27;s rehabilitation start. 
===Dickey–Stephens Park===
Dickey–Stephens Park, the new stadium in North Little Rock, Arkansas, hosted the first Travelers game against the Frisco RoughRiders on April 12, 2007. It is primarily used for baseball and is the home field of the Arkansas Travelers minor league baseball team. It holds at least 7,000 people. It was built through a partnership between the Travs, Little Rock financier Warren Stephens and the city of North Little Rock. After donating an plot of land east of the Broadway Bridge, Mr. Stephens named the ballpark in honor of two pairs of baseball-loving brothers; Stephens Inc. Founders Jack and Witt Stephens, and Hall of Fame Catcher Bill Dickey and his brother Skeeter, also a former Major League ballplayer. Both Dickey brothers worked for Stephens Inc. following their baseball careers. Bill, who caught for the 1925 Little Rock Travelers, also managed the club for one season following a 17-year Hall-of-Fame career with the New York Yankees that included seven World Series titles.
==Uniforms==
In 2004, the team introduced new road jerseys and alternate caps that paid homage to the Travs&#x27; home city. The jerseys had &quot;Little Rock&quot; written across the chest. Travelers’ jerseys have either featured &quot;Arkansas&quot; or &quot;Travelers&quot; ever since the 1950s. 
==Roster==
==General managers==

===Ray Winder===
In Ray Winder, was the general manager for Little Rock Travelers when it became defunct in 1961, but continued as general manager for the Arkansas Travelers until 1976. Winder had worked as a ticket taker in 1915 before rising to general manager. More than once, he almost single-handedly kept baseball in Little Rock. In 1960, at the last minute, he used his relationships with major league teams to sign enough players for the Travelers to field a team—it had looked as if the team would not make or would have to move to another town. During his 50-plus years with the team, he saw the Travelers sink to the bottom of the league only to rise three times to the league championship.

===Bill Valentine===
In 1976, Bill Valentine, a former American League umpire, was chosen as general manager for the Travelers. Valentine would remain general manager until in 2007 after 31 years and would remain executive vice president for two more seasons, before retiring in March 2009. Valentine worked as an announcer for the Arkansas Travelers for eight years. In his first season as general manager, the team saw a 34% increase in attendance, due in part to Valentine&#x27;s stunts including giving away tens of thousands of tickets to kids, hoping they would bring their parents to the game with them, and holding midget wrestling and amateur boxing at the stadium. The Travelers&#x27; attendance continued to increase over the years, and also saw on-field success, winning five league titles while Valentine was GM. Valentine has been inducted into the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame, the Arkansas Officials Association Hall of Fame, the Texas League Hall of Fame, and the North Little Rock Boys Club Hall of Fame.

<doc id="672585" wikidata="Q6842439" url="?curid=672585" title="Midland RockHounds">
<text>The Midland RockHounds are a Minor League Baseball team based in Midland, Texas. The team, which plays in the Texas League, is the Double-A affiliate of the Athletics major league club. The RockHounds play in Momentum Bank Ballpark, which opened in 2002 and seats 4,709 fans. They have won seven Texas League championships: in 1975 (co-champions with the Lafayette Drillers), 2005, 2009, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017.

==History==
The RockHounds were previously known as both the Midland Cubs (1972–1984) and Midland Angels (1985–1998). While Midland has been the Double-A affiliate of the Athletics since 1999, they were affiliated with the Chicago Cubs from 1972 to 1984, and then with the California Angels from 1985 to 1998. The team was renamed &quot;Rockhounds&quot;, a nickname for geologists, as a reference to the oil and gas industry of the area.

The RockHounds have received numerous awards throughout their history. The Midland franchise under the Angels won the Texas League Organization of the Year in 1990 and 1994 and as the RockHounds in 2002. In 1995, Midland won Double-A Baseball&#x27;s highest award, the Bob Frietas Award. General Manager Monty Hoppel has been named Executive of the Year with the franchise three times (1991, 1995, and 2002).

In 1995, Midland reached its first-ever playoff appearance as an affiliate of the Angels and their first playoff appearance overall in 20 years. It also became the first season that Midland accumulated more than 200,000 fans in a season, a feat repeated in 1996. The feat surprised many in Minor League Baseball as the Midland-Odessa area only has just over 200,000 residents total. The RockHounds moved into Momentum Bank Ballpark, part of the Scharbauer Sports Complex on the west side of Midland, in 2002. Since then, the RockHounds have averaged over 250,000 fans every season. Prior to that, their home had been what is now known as Christensen Stadium, in northeast Midland.

The Rockhounds won their first ever Texas League Championship in 2005. They shared the title with the Lafayette Drillers in 1975 as the Cubs. In 2006, they won the second-half championship of the South Division, but they lost to the eventual champion Corpus Christi Hooks in the division playoffs.

In 2007, the RockHounds won the John H. Johnson President&#x27;s Award, Minor League baseball highest award for a franchise, making them the third Texas League franchise to do so after the El Paso Diablos and the Tulsa Drillers.

In 2009, the RockHounds won their second Texas League pennant, defeating the Northwest Arkansas Naturals three games to one in the Championship Series. In 2010, the RockHounds returned to the Texas League title game, but this time fell to the Naturals.

In 2017, the RockHounds won their fourth straight Texas League title, the first team to do so since the Fort Worth Panthers won six in a row from 1920 to 1925.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the RockHounds were organized into the Double-A Central. In 2022, the Double-A Central became known as the Texas League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

==On the radio==
The Midland Rockhounds have always had a play-by-play broadcast that has been available. KCRS (AM) had been the network to carry roughly 95% of the Rockhounds games since they debuted in 1972. Some afternoon games in 2008 didn&#x27;t air on the radio due to contracts with Rush Limbaugh and others. For the 2009 season Gap Broadcasting announced the Rockhounds would have a new radio home, KFZX, also known as 102.1 Jack FM. For the 2010 season, the Rockhounds once again moved radio homes to KMRK 96.1 FM. In both cases Bob Hards remained the voice of the Rockhounds, a position he has currently held for 19 consecutive years. In 2013 the Rockhounds moved their games back to KCRS, though weekday day games would be preempted for talk shows that were already scheduled.

<text>The San Antonio Missions are a Minor League Baseball team based in San Antonio, Texas. The Missions compete in the Texas League as the Double-A affiliate of the San Diego Padres. The team plays its home games at Nelson W. Wolff Municipal Stadium, which opened in 1994 and seats over 6,200 people with a total capacity of over 9,000. The Missions are named for the Spanish missions around which the city was founded.

==History==
===Early years===
San Antonio was home for one of the charter members of the Texas League back in 1888. Since that inaugural season the town has hosted a number of Texas League franchises, most of them using the Missions moniker. Baseball was absent only a few of the early years (1889-1891,1893–1894, 1900–1902) and again when World War II occupied most would-be ballplayers between 1943 and 1945. Initially the team went by the names &quot;Missionaries&quot;, &quot;Gentlemen&quot;, and &quot;Bronchos&quot;—a Spanish twist on the name &quot;Broncos&quot;. During these years, nearly 250 players reached the major leagues.

The current Missions moniker was coined with the team&#x27;s first major league affiliation, a partnership with the St. Louis Browns. They remained affiliated with the Browns through the Texas League&#x27;s temporary demise after the 1942 season due to World War II. With the return of peace, they reaffiliated with the Browns, a partnership that continued in 1954 when they became the Baltimore Orioles. This affiliation lasted until 1959, when they struck up a partnership with the Chicago Cubs. While with the Browns/Orioles, the team saw well over 100 players reach the Major League Baseball, including Hall-of-Famers Willard Brown (1956) and Brooks Robinson (1956–1957).

The Missions won the Dixie Series, a postseason interleague championship between the champions of the Southern Association and the Texas League, in 1950, defeating the Nashville Vols, 4–3, in the best-of-seven series.
The Missions won the Pan American Series a postseason interleague championship between the champions of the Mexican League and Texas League, in 1961 defeaeating the Veracruz Aguilas 4–2 in the best of seven series.(Encyclopedia of Minor League Baseball, Third Edition, 2007, Lloyd Johnson and Miles Wolff, editors.)
The Missions name was used for the teams affiliated with the Cubs, through 1962. In just four years in the Cubs&#x27; system, more than 50 alumni reached the major leagues—including future Hall of Famers Ron Santo (1959) and Billy Williams (1959).

The Missions changed their name to the Bullets in 1963, when the team joined the new Houston Colt .45s organization. The idea behind the name was that the team&#x27;s prospects would be the &quot;bullets to the gun&quot; of the .45s team. The Bullets boasted 30 prospects that would go on to see time in Major League Baseball, including Hall-of-Famer Joe Morgan and two-time National League All-Star Jerry Grote.

In 1965, the San Antonio franchise moved to Amarillo. Three years later, in 1968, baseball returned to San Antonio, again taking on the Missions name, as part of an expansion of the Texas League. Again playing as a Cubs affiliate, another 42 future big leaguers took the field over a four-year stretch. After the 1971 season, the team packed up again and moved to Midland, where they continued as the Midland Cubs.

In 1972, another ownership group brought baseball into town to replace the group that left to Midland, and brought with it an affiliation with the Milwaukee Brewers, just two years removed from their move to Wisconsin from Seattle. With the affiliation change to the Brewers, the franchise took the parent club&#x27;s nickname—which it kept despite changes in affiliation to the Cleveland Indians (1973–1975) and Texas Rangers (1976). The Brewers nickname fit the city almost as well as it fit their single-season affiliate in Milwaukee, being the home of the Pearl Brewing Company.

The future major league players continued to pour onto the field through the affiliation changes, and more than 30 San Antonio Brewers made it to the top. Among them was Hall-of-Fame pitcher Dennis Eckersley, an Indians farmhand who tore through the Texas League in 1974.

===Los Angeles Dodgers (1977–2000)===
The team became the San Antonio Dodgers with a change in affiliation to the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1977. While the franchise kept the Dodger moniker for 11 seasons (1977–1987), locals still referred to them occasionally as the Missions. The Dodgers responded by officially changing their nickname back to Missions for the 1988 season.

The Missions were the Double-A affiliate of the Los Angeles Dodgers until 2000, making the relationship the longest-standing major league affiliation held by the San Antonio franchise. During the partnership, Dodgers legends frequented the Alamo City, including Tommy Lasorda. In the 23 years with Los Angeles, some 211 players went on to see time in the majors. That includes players like Ron Washington (1977), Bob Welch (1977), Ron Roenicke (1978–1979), Mike Scioscia (1978), Dave Stewart (1978), Orel Hershiser (1980–1981, 1991), Fernando Valenzuela (1980), Steve Sax (1981), Sid Bream (1982), Sid Fernandez (1983), Franklin Stubbs (1983), Ramón Martínez (1988, 1996), John Wetteland (1988), Eric Karros (1990), Pedro Martínez (1991), Raúl Mondesí (1991–1992), Eric Young (1991), Mike Piazza (1992), Henry Blanco (1993–1996), Todd Hollandsworth (1993), Chan Ho Park (1994), Miguel Cairo (1995), Paul Lo Duca (1995, 1997), Paul Konerko (1996), Alex Cora (1997), Dennys Reyes (1997), Adrián Beltré (1998), and Éric Gagné (1999).

The team played the bulk of its years with the Dodgers at V. J. Keefe Memorial Stadium, which they shared with the St. Mary&#x27;s University baseball team. In 1994, the team moved into Nelson W. Wolff Municipal Stadium, utilizing a design typical of baseball stadiums build during the late-1980s through the mid-1990s. The new stadium was named in honor of Nelson Wolff, the mayor of San Antonio at the time the stadium was built.

The affiliation with the Dodgers ended after the 2000 season with both clubs mutually agreeing to part.

===Seattle Mariners (2001–2006)===
From 2001 until 2006, the Seattle Mariners had a player development contract with the team that brought back-to-back Texas League Championships during the 2002 and 2003 seasons.

The Mariners, fresh off a record season, was stocked with talent in a minor league system built by Pat Gillick, who worked with San Antonio as the farm director of the Houston Colt .45s in 1963. Gillick&#x27;s prospects turned San Antonio into a Texas League powerhouse, boasting future major leaguers Willie Bloomquist, Jeff Farnsworth, J. J. Putz, Rafael Soriano, Greg Dobbs, Julio Mateo, Gil Meche, Cha Seung Baek, Jose Lopez, George Sherrill, Shin-Soo Choo, Félix Hernández, Mike Morse, Aaron Taylor, Aaron Looper, Allan Simpson, and Yuniesky Betancourt.

The 2006 Missions struggled to score runs and finished 60–77 overall (27–41, 33–37). The team was plagued by high player turnover and featured 52 different players over the course of the season.

===San Diego Padres (2007–2018)===
The Missions entered into a new player development contract with the San Diego Padres beginning in 2007. Randy Ready managed the Missions that season following a promotion from the Class A Fort Wayne Wizards. The first home game as a member of the Padres organization was on April 12, 2007, a 2–0 win against the Tulsa Drillers. Sean Thompson picked up the win and helped score a run. Led by Chase Headley and Josh Geer, who won Player of the Year and Pitcher of the Year honors respectively, the Missions were the 2007 Texas League Champions.

From the beginning of the affiliation with the Padres, the Missions saw nearly a dozen players go on to play the big leagues. Most notably include rising Padres regulars: Chase Headley, Kyle Blanks, Nick Hundley, Tim Stauffer, Mat Latos, Matt Antonelli, Chad Huffman, Will Venable, and Luis Durango.

The 2009 season started out with an exhibition game between players on the Missions roster and members of the Padres&#x27; big league Spring Training roster. The result was a 7–3 win for the minor league affiliate, bolstered by a grand slam by San Antonio-native Seth Johnston. Under the leadership of former MLB All-Star Terry Kennedy, the team earned a playoff berth by winning the first-half division title—clinching the berth on the road during an extra-innings win at Corpus Christi on June 23, the last game in the first half of the season.

The season was anticlimactic, however, as the team struggled down the final stretch and into playoffs. The Missions were eliminated by the Midland RockHounds, the eventual Texas League title winners, in four games—managing only to win one playoff game behind the pitching of Will Inman.

Several players stood out at times during the 2009 season, some of them being promoted for their performance. Outfielder Mike Baxter was promoted early on for his assault on Texas League pitching, batting .376 with 23 doubles in 51 games. Pitchers Tim Stauffer, Cesar Carrillo, and Mat Latos were promoted to the Padres after performing well at the Double-A level, though Stauffer and Carrillo both spent a few weeks at the Triple-A level before moving on to the Majors. First baseman Craig Cooper led the team with a .312 average and 11 home runs by the end of the season. Outfielder Luis Durango led the Texas League with 44 stolen bases. Right-hander Ernesto Frieri led the team in most pitching categories, finishing the season protected on the 40-man major league roster.

For the 2010 season, the Missions were managed by Doug Dascenzo, who previously managed Class A Fort Wayne TinCaps to the best regular-season record in Minor League Baseball and a Midwest League title in 2009. The 2010 Texas League All-Star Game featured seven Missions players, including three starters. Pitchers Simón Castro, Wynn Pelzer, Craig Italiano, and Evan Scribner were selected to represent the Missions along with catcher Luis Martinez, first baseman Matt Clark and outfielder Cedric Hunter. Just before the game, Cedric was promoted to the Triple-A Portland Beavers, allowing utility infielder Andy Parrino to attend the All-Star Game in his place.

The Missions got a hot start to the 2011 season, finishing April with the best record in Double-A baseball. They also amassed the most home runs of any team in Minor League Baseball in that time despite playing in the notoriously pitcher-friendly Wolff Stadium. Their early season success can be attributed to a roster filled with some of the top slugging prospects in the Padres&#x27; system, including Jaff Decker and Cody Decker (not related). They also had an offensive boost with the return of Kyle Blanks, who played for the Missions in 2008, and rehabbed with the Missions after Tommy John surgery. The Missions won the first-half division title, then won their twelfth Texas League Championship, sweeping the Arkansas Travelers in the Texas League Championship series. During the season, the team hosted the 75th Annual Texas League All-Star Game on June 29, 2011.

In 2012, Nate Freiman played for the Missions and led the league in RBIs (105) and hits (154). He was both a Texas League Mid-Season and Post-Season All-Star, and an MILB.com San Diego Padres All-Star.

The Missions began participation in &quot;Copa de la Diversión&quot; (&quot;Fun Cup&quot;), an initiative by Minor League Baseball to connect teams with their local Hispanic communities, in 2018. For &quot;Copa&quot; games, the Missions play as the &quot;San Antonio Flying Chanclas&quot;. The , the Spanish term for a slipper or flip-flop, was chosen to honor the Hispanic grandmother for her strength, discipline, and love as she uses the footwear to keep her family in-line.

===Milwaukee Brewers (2019–2020)===
On June 21, 2017, team owner David G. Elmore announced the relocation of the Triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox of the Pacific Coast League to San Antonio in 2019. The team would continue use of the Missions nickname, effectively elevating San Antonio to a Triple-A franchise. Meanwhile, the Missions Double-A franchise moved to Amarillo and continued to compete in the Texas League as the Amarillo Sod Poodles.

The Missions signed a two-year player development contract with the Milwaukee Brewers to be their top minor league affiliate through 2020. They played their first Triple-A game on April 4, 2019, a 5–3 win, against the Oklahoma City Dodgers at Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark in Oklahoma City. The winning run was scored in the top of the ninth inning when Jake Hager hit an RBI triple scoring Nate Orf and Corey Ray. They won their first home game 6–5 over the Memphis Redbirds on April 9.

===San Diego Padres (2021–present)===
In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s reorganization of the minors after the 2020 season, the Missions were selected to move back down to Double-A as affiliates of the San Diego Padres. In a further change, they were organized into the Double-A Central. In 2022, the Double-A Central became known as the Texas League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization. Following the 2022 season, the team was purchased by Designated Bidders, LLC, a group of San Antonio business executives.

=== Season-by-season records ===
The following is a list of San Antonio&#x27;s results since the 1968 season.

==Rivals==
The Missions&#x27; chief rival from 2005 to 2018 was the Corpus Christi Hooks. The teams contended to determine which is the better team of South Texas. The Missions were previously rivals with the Round Rock Express, but this was interrupted when the Express joined the PCL in 2005. The Missions and Express competed again in the PCL&#x27;s American Conference Southern Division from 2019 to 2020.

==Signature promotions==
Since 1989, during the seventh inning of each game, an auxiliary mascot named Henry the Puffy Taco is chased around the bases by a child from the stands, typically between 6 and 10 years of age. The kid tackles the giant taco to the ground just before reaching home plate (they start at first base), then poses triumphantly over the downed mascot. Henry has only won the race once, in 1992. In that race, Henry mistimed his steps and he inadvertently crossed home plate before his 10-year-old opponent. Nearly 20 years later the Missions hosted a rematch and, on June 24, 2010, the child finally avenged his loss.

The team has two unique giveaway nights—Shirt Off Your Back and Used Car Giveaway. In the first, often held on or near the last game of the season, the jerseys worn by the players during the game are raffled off to fans in the stands (raffle tickets are offered at no charge, and each fan is limited to one entry). The same raffle format is used for the Used Car Giveaway, where more than 10 used cars are given away throughout the night. In 2010, the prizes included a 2001 Ford Mustang and a 2001 Volvo S60.

==Ballpark==
The Missions play their home games at Nelson W. Wolff Municipal Stadium which opened in 1994. The ballpark seats more than 6,200 spectators and holds more than 9,000 people with additional outfield grass berm seating. The team has sought a new stadium since 2009, and continues to do so, though the team moved to the Triple-A Pacific Coast League in 2019.

Tickets for Missions games are priced on par with other minor league parks, ranging from $11 to $30 based on the section of the ballpark or $10 for berm seating.

<text>Cyd Ho Sau-lan () is a former member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong (Legco) for the Hong Kong Island constituency.

She is a founding member of the Labour Party, since December 2011, and currently holds the position of vice-chairwoman. Previously, she was a founding member of The Frontier, another pro-democracy political group. Since 2006, she has been a founding councillor of the World Future Council.

She has garnered a reputation for promoting universal suffrage, rule of law, human rights, and equal opportunity, as well as advancement in the interests of women, homosexuals and other minority groups.

==Education==
Ho studied at the University of Waterloo, Canada. She worked in the textile trading industry from 1979 to 1995.

==Career==
In 1991, Ho helped Emily Lau during the election campaign, the first open direct election of Legco in Hong Kong. In 1993, she founded the liberal pressure group &#x27;United Ants&#x27; with other pro-democracy political activists. In 1995, she worked as an assistant to Margaret Ng, a lawmaker representing the legal profession in Legco. In 1996, along with other political activists, she founded The Frontier.

She was elected a legislative councillor for the geographical constituency of New Territories East in 1998 in the first Legco election since the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong from the UK to China. She was re-elected in the c in 2000. She chaired bills committees such as the 2004 Education (Revised) Bill and the 2004 Examination Authority Bill, and was vice-chair of the panel on environmental affairs. She chaired the Sub-committee under the Home Affair Panel to study questions of discrimination based on sexual orientation between 2000 and 2004.

She was elected as a District Council member of the Central and Western district via the Kwun Lung (觀龍) constituency in November 2003, unseating veteran Ip Kwok-him of the DAB with a margin of 64 votes. She also supported members of other pro-democracy political groups such as Civic Act-up, which were also contesting seats in the Wanchai district council.

In 2004, she, together with James To Kun Sun, Frederick Fung Kin Kee, Wong Sing Chi, Mak Kwok Fung, attempted to cross the border and meet Beijing officials at Shenzhen, to request a faster pace of democratisation in Hong Kong.

==2004 Legco election==
The 2004 Legislative Council election returned candidates to office based on a party-list proportional representation system. There were four viable tickets running for election for the Hong Kong Island constituency. The left was represented by the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong&#x27;s ticket, consisting of Ma Lik and Choy So-yuk; and the centrist ticket was represented by Rita Fan.

The pan-democratic camp decided, after strategising, to put up two tickets for election: the Democratic Party&#x27;s ticket with Martin Lee and Yeung Sum, and Audrey Eu and Cyd Ho&#x27;s ticket. The thinking was that the remainder vote on both these tickets was sufficient to return all four candidates to office, providing that voters in the pan-democratic camp were coordinated effectively. Cyd Ho was defeated by a slim margin (815 out of a total of about 350,000, or 0.23%) to her nearest DAB rival, Choy So-yuk.

Originally, the slogan &quot;1+1=4&quot; was taken as a way to strategically allocate votes between the two pan-democratic camp tickets, namely that a spouse from each couple would vote for each ticket. Conspiracy theorists claim that, during the final days leading up to the election, the Democratic Party believed it could secure a seat for their third candidate, Lai Chi-Keung. The Democratic Party hence allegedly requested all supporters of the pan-democratic camp in the Hong Kong Island geographical constituency to vote for them, claiming that Audrey Eu&#x27;s star presence on the other ticket was strong enough to skew votes to the other ticket.

In the end, Lai ended up a few hundred votes short of Cyd Ho, costing them both the chance for a seat. This ultimately benefited Cyd Ho&#x27;s DAB rival Choy So-yuk. A number of disgruntled voters of the pan-democratic camp demanded that then-DP chairman Yeung Sum and Founding chairman Martin Lee Chu-ming both step down in consequence. 

==Post-election==
In addition to remaining as a key member of the Frontier until 2006, Ho hosted weekly radio programmes on two local radio stations in 2006 – on RTHK and PRHK. She hosted a radio show on the internet radio station My Radio on Thursday nights (2200–2300 HKT).

In 2006, she quit the Frontier and became the chairperson of the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor and the co-convener of Project Civil Referendum, a scheme to pilot and promote the idea of holding a referendum in Hong Kong.

In 2007, when the death of Ma Lik vacated a Hong Kong Island Legislative Council seat, she originally decided to run in the by-election, but later she decided against. Also, she declined to stand again for her district council seat to prepare for her 2008 Legco election campaign.

==2008 Legco election==
Ho stood for and was returned in the Hong Kong Island geographical constituency for the 2008 Hong Kong legislative election. She finished with the fifth highest number of votes in the six-member constituency, 30,887, or 9.85%. Her running mate in 2004, Audrey Eu of the Civic Party, obtained 30,362.

== Labour Party ==
In December 2011, after The Frontier had failed to pass its own resolution to dissolve, she joined with Lee Cheuk-yan, Cheung Kwok-che and others to form the Labour Party, taking up the position of vice-chairwoman. She was re-elected in 2012 elections.

== LGBT rights ==
In 2012, soon after Ho re-elected as member of Legco, she put forward a proposal calling for public consultation on legislation to outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation. This proposal was supported by most of the pro-democrats and some pro-Beijing lawmakers, but was veto by Democratic Party lawmaker James To (who voted abstained) and pro-Beijing conservative parties. During her terms, Ho is one of only few legislators to openly support same-sex marriage and other LGBT rights, conservative parties and groups criticised her on this issue. Though most of the pro-democrats support non-discrimination laws, they are less openly discuss and talk about this issue, as the pro-democrats have many supporters with many social conservative views.

==2016 Legco election==
She lost in the 2016 Hong Kong legislative election with 19,376 votes, placed ninth in the Hong Kong Island constituency, along with the former party chairman Lee Cheuk-yan, leaving the Labour Party only one representative in the legislature.

==2020 arrest==
On 18 April 2020, Ho was arrested as one of 15 Hong Kong high-profile democracy figures, on suspicion of organising, publicising or taking part in several unauthorised assemblies between August and October 2019 in the course of the anti-extradition bill protests. Following protocol, the police statement did not disclose the names of the accused, however others arrested include veteran lawyers Martin Lee and Margaret Ng.

<text>The Tulsa Drillers are a minor league baseball team based in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The team, which plays in the Texas League, is the Double-A affiliate of the Los Angeles Dodgers major-league club.

==Stadium==
The Drillers play at ONEOK Field (pronounced &quot;one-oak&quot;), in downtown Tulsa&#x27;s Greenwood district. The team previously played at Drillers Stadium on the Tulsa County Fairgrounds at 15th and Yale in midtown Tulsa. The Drillers held their first home opener at ONEOK Field on April 8, 2010, losing 7–0 to the Corpus Christi Hooks in front of an over-capacity crowd of 8,665. In their first season in the new ballpark, the Drillers drew total attendance of 408,183, the highest season figure in the history of Tulsa professional baseball.

==History==
The Drillers came into being in 1977, when the two-year-old Lafayette Drillers were moved to Tulsa from Louisiana. Before that time, the Triple-A Tulsa Oilers had been the city&#x27;s minor league club, but owner A. Ray Smith moved that team to New Orleans due to concerns over the dilapidated condition of Oiler Park. The new team opted to keep the Drillers name carried over from Lafayette—appropriate given the importance of oil to the Tulsa economy. Apart from World War II, professional baseball has been played in Tulsa continuously since 1932.

The Drillers set up shop at Oiler Park, which was renamed Driller Park. However, it was obvious that the old stadium was at the end of its useful life, and plans were already underway for a replacement. Tulsa County completed 8,000 seat Robert B. Sutton Stadium in 1981, naming it for its chief benefactor, a local oil executive. Sutton, however, was convicted in 1982 of fraud, and as a result the County renamed the park Tulsa County Stadium, and renamed it Drillers Stadium in 1989.

From 1977 to 2002, the Drillers were the Double-A affiliate of the Texas Rangers. In 2002, Rangers owner Tom Hicks purchased the Shreveport, Louisiana Texas League franchise with the intention of moving the team to Frisco, Texas, a suburban city north of Dallas, Texas. At the time, the Shreveport Swamp Dragons were affiliated with the San Francisco Giants; Hicks cast aside this association and bought out the remaining two years of Tulsa&#x27;s Player Development Contract. The Drillers then signed a two-year agreement with the Colorado Rockies. After the 2014 season they signed an affiliation agreement with the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Batting coach Mike Coolbaugh was killed in a freak accident on July 22, 2007. While standing in the first base coach box, he was hit in the head by a line drive. Although CPR was administered at the scene, he died less than an hour later. The Drillers and Travelers suspended their game, which the Travelers had been leading, 7–3, in the ninth inning. The Drillers also postponed their game the following night. The coroner concluded that Coolbaugh was actually hit in the neck with the line drive instead of the head, which ruptured an artery in his neck, killing him. As a result of this event, Major League Baseball began making helmets for base coaches mandatory in 2008.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Drillers were organized into the Double-A Central. In 2022, the Double-A Central became known as the Texas League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

On October 3, 2023, the club announced that it had sold majority ownership to Diamond Baseball Holdings.

==Championship seasons==
The Drillers were Texas League champions four times: in 1982, 1988, 1998 and in 2018. They won the Eastern Division championship in 1999 and 2002. The Drillers also appeared in the Texas League playoffs during the 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2017 seasons.

==Ownership==
Tulsa businessman Bill Rollings acquired the Lafayette franchise and moved it to Tulsa in 1977. Country music entertainer Roy Clark was a co-owner of the team for six years. Went Hubbard bought the team in 1986. In March 2006, Chuck Lamson (a former Drillers pitcher and executive) bought out much of Hubbard&#x27;s stock in the team; Lamson became president and majority owner of the team. In December 2010, Lamson sold his stock back to Hubbard. This transaction made Hubbard the sole owner of the team; his sons, Dale and Jeff, became co-chairmen. Went and Dale Hubbard are residents of Walpole, New Hampshire; Jeff Hubbard, a former player (in 1987) and coach (in 1991) for the Drillers, lives in Durham, North Carolina. Went Hubbard died in September 2012.

==Media==
ESPN SportsCenter anchor John Anderson has often alluded to team alumni as &quot;former Driller(s)&quot; on-air. Anderson was a weekend sports anchor for Tulsa CBS affiliate KOTV before joining ESPN.

For 13 years the Tulsa Drillers&#x27; radio (and sometime television) announcer was Mark Neely, but in January 2009 it was announced that Neely had been hired to be the new TV play-by-play announcer for the San Diego Padres. In February the Drillers announced that Neely&#x27;s replacement would be Dennis Higgins, former announcer for the Wichita Wranglers. Since the 2005 season, the Drillers have been broadcast on KTBZ (AM), Sports Radio 1430, &quot;The Buzz&quot; in Tulsa.

<text>The Wichita Wranglers were a minor league baseball team based in Wichita, Kansas. The team, which played in the Texas League, was the Double-A affiliate of Major League Baseball&#x27;s San Diego Padres from 1987 to 1994 and the Kansas City Royals from 1995 to 2007. The Wranglers played in Wichita&#x27;s Lawrence–Dumont Stadium. Built in 1934 and renovated for the second time in 2001, the park held 6,400 people as of the Wranglers&#x27; last season.

Following the completion of the 2007 season, the team was relocated to Springdale, Arkansas, where it became the Northwest Arkansas Naturals, which continue to play in the Texas League as the Double-A affiliate of the Royals.

The Wranglers won the Texas League Championship in 1987, 1992, and 1999. In 1995, Wichita&#x27;s Johnny Damon won the Texas League Player of the Year Award. Alex Gordon won the award in 2006. Andy Benes was selected as the league&#x27;s Pitcher of the Year in 1989.

<text>Krafla () is a volcanic caldera of about in diameter with a long fissure zone. It is located in the north of Iceland in the Mývatn region and is situated on the Iceland hotspot atop the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which forms the divergent boundary between the North American Plate and the Eurasian Plate. Its highest peak reaches up to and it is in depth. There have been 29 reported eruptions in recorded history.

==Overview==
Iceland sits astride the Mid-Atlantic Ridge; the western part of the island nation is part of the roughly westward-moving North American plate, while the eastern part of the island is part of the roughly eastward-moving Eurasian Plate. The north–south axis of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge splits Iceland in two, roughly north to south. Along this ridge many of Iceland&#x27;s most active volcanoes are located; Krafla is one of these.

Krafla includes the crater Víti , which contains a green lake. South of the Krafla area is Námafjall , a mountain, at the foot of which is Hverir , a geothermal area with boiling mudpools and steaming fumaroles.

===History===

The Mývatn fires occurred between 1724 and 1729, when many of the fissure vents opened up. The lava fountains could be seen in the south of the island, and a lava flow destroyed three farms near the village of Reykjahlíð, although nobody was harmed.

Between 1975 and 1984, a series of volcanic events known as the Krafla fires took place within the Krafla caldera. There were nine volcanic eruptions and fifteen uplift and subsidence events. During these events a large magma chamber was identified at depth by analysing the seismic activity. Some of the lava fountaining during these eruptions was caught on film by Maurice and Katia Krafft, and features in the 2022 film, Fire of Love.

Since 1977 the Krafla area has been the source of the geothermal energy used by a 60 MWe power station. A survey undertaken in 2006 indicated very high temperatures at depths of between , and these favourable conditions led to the development of the first well from the Iceland Deep Drilling Project, IDDP-1, that found molten rhyolite magma deep beneath the surface in 2009. The Krafla fires interrupted some of the geothermal drilling work in the area.

==Krafla magma testbed==
Following on from the encounter with molten rock during the drilling of IDDP-1, the Krafla Magma Testbed (KMT) concept has been developed, which envisages the creation of an &#x27;international magma observatory&#x27; and further scientific drilling at Krafla in order to deliberately drill into the magma body.

<text>The Black Family is a professional wrestling face / tecnico stable that has been working in AAA since 2000. Originally a heel / rudo stable, The Black Family currently consists of original member Dark Cuervo as well as the later additions of Dark Ozz, and Dark Espíritu. The group is also referred to as the Dark Family, mainly became all members added the word &quot;Dark &quot; to their names in 2007, the two names are used interchangeably. The Black Family is often part of a much larger stables such as &quot;Lucha Libre Latina&quot; (LLL) or &quot;La Secta De Mesias &quot;but act as a unit within the larger stable. Members of the group has held the AAA World Tag Team Championship once and the Mexican National Atómicos Championship three times in two different combinations. In October 2010 the stable turned tecnico for the first time. In 2015 Dark Ozz and Espiritu left AAA and Cuervo and Scoria reformed the Black Family.

==History==
The Black Family was created in 2000 when Charly Manson, Chessman Escoria and Cuervo were teamed up to form a &quot;rudo&quot; (Heel or &quot;bad guy&quot;) group that shared a Goth-inspired look, reflected in their ring clothes and painted faces. In 2001 the masked wrestler Path Finder was repackaged as Ozz and joined the Black Family following a career threatening injury to Charly Manson that forced him out of the ring for several months. In late 2001 Charly Manson returned while still not fully recovered, and began a war of words with the Black Family as Chessman had taken over his leadership role in Manson&#x27;s absence. The storyline did not develop further as Manson left AAA altogether. When Chessman took over leadership of the group the Black Family joined &quot;Lucha Libre Latina&quot; (LLL), the Mexican version of the New World Order, a group led by Chessman&#x27;s long time friend Cibernético. Even though they were part of a much larger group the four men still worked as a unit, a stable within the stable.

The Black Family made their first major show appearance at the 2001 &quot;Verano de Escandalo&quot; where they lost an elimination match to Los Vatos Locos (Espíritu, Nygma, Silver Cat &amp; Picudo), also in the match were Los Vipers (Psicosis II, Histeria, Maniaco &amp; Mosco de la Merced) and Los Exoticos. the team did not make another major show appearance until a year later when they unsuccessfully challenged Los Vatos Locos for the Mexican National Atómicos Championship at Verano de Escandalo (2002). that challenge was the first of many as the Black Family began chasing the Atómicos title and feuding with Los Vatos Locos. when Los Vatos Locos lost the titles to someone else in late 2002 the Black Family started to target the new champions Oscar Sevilla and Los Barrio Boys (Alan, Billy Boy and Decnis). When Charly Manson returned to action he sided with Los Vipers instead of the Black Family leading to a match at Guerra de Titanes 2002 where the Black Family defeated Manson, Histeria, Mosco de la Merced and Psicosis II. On July 18, 2003 the Black Family won their first championship as a unit when they defeated Oscar Sevilla and Los Barrio Boys for the Atómicos title, but their run only lasted 31 days before Sevilla and Los Barrio Boys regained the titles. It would be just over a year before the Black Family got another opportunity to hold the titles as they won them on August 20, 2004.

===La Secta===

In 2005 Cibernético formed a new group called La Secta Cibernetica that included his friends Charly Manson and Chessman and through Chessman&#x27;s membership the Black Family was also invited to join this new supergroup. The group assisted Cibernético in his fight with La Parka (the AAA version), being unable to prevent him from being unmasked at Triplemanía XII. Later in the year Muerta Cibernetica was brought in to get revenge on La Parka. When Cibernético suffered a severe knee injury Muerta Cibernetica took over the group and kicked Cibernético out. Muerta Cibernetica was himself unmasked by La Parka 2 years after Cibernético was unmasked. After holding the Atómicos titles for 789 days the Black Family lost to the Mexican Powers (Crazy Boy, Juventud Guerrera, Joe Lider and Psicosis II) on October 18, 2006. Not long after they lost the tag team titles Chessman turned &quot;Technicó&quot; and sided with Cibernético and Charly Manson to form &quot;Los Hell Brothers&quot; fighting against La Secta, now known as &quot;La Secta del Mesias&quot; as Muerta Cibernetica changed his name to &quot;EL Mesias&quot;. With Chessman out of the Black Family the team invited Espíritu to leave Los Vatos Locos and join them, the invitation was accepted without any friction from the rest of Los Vatos Locos. During 2006 La Secta del Mesias became part of the super group of &quot;Rudós&quot; known as &quot;La Legión Extranjera&quot; making the Black Family a sub-group of a sub-group. Sometime in 2006 all four members of the Black Family changed their names slightly adding the word &quot;Dark&quot; in front of their names, thus Ozz became &quot;&#x27;Dark Ozz&quot; although the names are use interchangeably.
In early 2007 Ozz teamed with Cuervo to compete in a 16 team tournament to crown the first ever AAA World Tag Team Champions. in the end four teams met in the finals at the Rey de Reyes (2007) event. Dark Ozz and Dark Cuervo defeated The Mexican Powers (Crazy Boy and Joe Lider), Los Guapos (Alan Stone and Zumbido) and Real Fuerza Aérea AAA (Pegasso and Super Fly) in an elimination match to win the titles. Ozz became a double champion when the Black Family won the Atómicos titles from the Mexican Powers on May 20, 2007. The dual title situation only lasted until Triplemanía XV where the Mexican Powers team of Crazy Boy and Joe Lider won the Tag Team Championship.

===End of La Secta===
In early 2008 El Mesias and the rest of La Secta were kicked out of &quot;La Legión Extranjera&quot; with &quot;La Legión&quot; putting El Mesias out of commission for a while. When El Mesias returned to active competition, tension began to build between the Black Family and El Mesias. The tensions culminated after El Mesias lost a Steel Cage &quot;Street Fight&quot; Match to Vampiro at Verano de Escandalo (2008) which led to the Black Family attacking El Mesias, officially severing their relationship. After breaking up La Secta del Mesias, Dark Ozz assumed leadership of the group as they began to feud with El Mesias. During the fall and winter of 2008 both Charly Manson and Chessman made hints at them possibly returning to the Black Family but Manson got injured and taken off TV while Chessman turned on the group after feinting friendship. On January 9, 2009, Chessman teamed with the Psycho Circus (Killer Clown, Psycho Clown and Zombie Clown) to end the Black Family&#x27;s Atómicos title run. Since the loss of the Atómicos title the Black Family has been without a general purpose, working mid-card matches and filling in when needed without a specific storyline in the works.

===El Inframundo===
On October 1, 2010, at Héroes Inmortales IV, The Black Family turned technico for the first time, when Ozz and Cuervo represented AAA in its battle against &quot;La Sociedad&quot;. On October 20, 2010, Escoria officially left The Black Family to join Cibernético and Taboo in the new &quot;Los Bizarros&quot; stable. In May 2011, the rest of The Black Family joined La Parka and Drago to form &quot;El Inframundo&quot; (&quot;The Underworld&quot;) and battle &quot;Los Bizarros&quot;.

===Dark Family===
On March 31, 2017, Cuervo and Scoria won the AAA World Tag Team Championship, which they held until May 26. They regained the titles on December 16, 2017.

<doc id="672610" wikidata="Q7290027" url="?curid=672610" title="Ramparts (magazine)">
<text>Ramparts was a glossy illustrated American political and literary magazine, published from 1962 to 1975 and closely associated with the New Left political movement. Unlike most of the radical magazines of the day, &quot;Ramparts&quot; was expensively produced and graphically sophisticated.

==Establishment ==
&quot;Ramparts&quot; was established in June 1962 by Edward Michael Keating Sr. in Menlo Park, California, as a &quot;showcase for the creative writer and as a forum for the mature American Catholic&quot;. The magazine declared its intent to publish &quot;fiction, poetry, art, criticism and essays of distinction, reflecting those positive principles of the Hellenic-Christian tradition which have shaped and sustained our civilization for the past two thousand years, and which are needed still to guide us in an age grown increasingly secular, bewildered, and afraid&quot;.

The founding location was an office space at 1182 Chestnut Street, Menlo Park, California. Edward Keating and his wife Helen (née English) personally financed the magazine. The early magazine included pieces by Thomas Merton and John Howard Griffin, but one observer compared its design to &quot;the poetry annual of a Midwestern girls school&quot;.

Under editor Warren Hinckle, the magazine upgraded its look, converted to a monthly news magazine, and moved to San Francisco. It once occupied the historic Colombo Building. Robert Scheer became managing editor, and Dugald Stermer was hired as art director.

== Activities ==
&quot;Ramparts&quot; was an early opponent of the Vietnam War. Its April 1966 cover article concerned the Michigan State University Group, a technical assistance program in South Vietnam that &quot;Ramparts&quot; claimed was a front for CIA covert operations. For that story, &quot;Ramparts&quot; won the George Polk Award for Magazine Reporting. In August 1966, managing editor James F. Colaianni wrote the first national article denouncing the US use of napalm in that conflict. &quot;The Children of Vietnam&quot;, a January 1967 photo-essay by William F. Pepper, depicted some of the injuries inflicted on Vietnamese children by U.S. attacks. That piece led Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to oppose the war publicly for the first time, and he offered &quot;Ramparts&quot; the sole rights to publish the text of his speech.

In March 1967, &quot;Ramparts&quot; revealed links between the CIA and the National Student Association (NSA), raising concerns about CIA involvement in domestic issues. The CIA knew about the revelations in advance, and tried their best to limit the extent of the scandal. Nevertheless, financial clues led to further stories by the press, revealing CIA ties to groups like Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty and the Asia Foundation. In the estimation of historian John Prados, the ensuing scandal &quot;marked a sea change for the agency&quot;.

One of the magazine&#x27;s most controversial covers depicted the hands of four of its editors holding burning draft cards, with their names clearly visible. &quot;Ramparts&quot; also covered conspiracy theories about the Kennedy assassination. The magazine published Che Guevara&#x27;s diaries, with an introduction by Fidel Castro, and the prison diaries of Eldridge Cleaver, later republished as &quot;Soul on Ice.&quot; Upon his release from prison, Cleaver became a &quot;Ramparts&quot; staff writer.

The magazine&#x27;s size and influence grew dramatically over these years. Moving to monthly production, combined subscriptions and newsstand sales increased from just under 100,000 at the end of 1966 to nearly 250,000 in 1968, a figure more than double that of the liberal weekly, &quot;The Nation&quot;.

Beginning in 1966, American authorities began investigating the magazine&#x27;s funding, suspecting Soviet financial connections. CIA Director William Raborn asked for a report, and files were gathered on many of the editors and writers. According to a book published in 2008, it was the first time the CIA had targeted a US publication, a violation of the National Security Act of 1947. The CIA failed to find communist ties.

The magazine also published articles written by Anthony Russo, one of the men involved in the leaking of the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot;, about the RAND Corporation.

==Decline==
Despite its impressive circulation figures, high production and promotional costs made &quot;Ramparts&quot; operate at a heavy financial loss during the last years of the 1960s, with its operating deficit topping $500,000 a year in both 1967 and 1968. Bankruptcy and a temporary cessation of production followed. The magazine&#x27;s temporary shift to a biweekly format and an expensive trip to cover the 1968 Democratic National Convention led to financial instability, as did a drop in subscriptions. With a reduced budget and a smaller staff, &quot;Ramparts&quot; continued publication.

In 1970, &quot;Ramparts&quot; contributor Susan Lydon wrote &quot;The Politics of Orgasm&quot;. The male editorial board first laughed at Lydon&#x27;s proposed article, but she persisted. Upon publication, the article sparked widespread discussion of the fake orgasm, and it was later brought into the scholarly literature about women&#x27;s sexuality. &quot;Ramparts&quot; editor Robert Scheer acknowledged &quot;The Politics of Orgasm&quot; as &quot;one of our great articles.&quot;

In June 1972, the magazine printed the wiring schematics necessary to create a mute box (a variant of the blue box). All sold issues were recalled or seized from newsstands by police and officials of Pacific Bell, causing financial loss to the magazine. The magazine ceased operations for good in 1975.

==Legacy==
Several former staffers went on to found their own magazines. Jann Wenner and Ralph J. Gleason founded &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1967. Adam Hochschild, Richard Parker, and Paul Jacobs created &quot;Mother Jones&quot; in 1976. At &quot;Scanlan&#x27;s Monthly&quot;, editor Warren Hinckle paired Hunter S. Thompson and illustrator Ralph Steadman for what is widely regarded as the first example of Gonzo journalism. Robert Scheer later became a featured columnist in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, edited the Truthdig website, and appeared on the NPR program &quot;Left, Right and Center&quot;. Another &quot;Ramparts&quot; editor, James Ridgeway, was a senior correspondent in the Washington, D.C. bureau of &quot;Mother Jones&quot;.

James F. Colaianni later represented the radical Catholic perspective with the books &quot;Married Priests &amp; Married Nuns&quot; and &quot;The Catholic Left&quot;. Three editors, David Horowitz, Sol Stern and Peter Collier, later denounced the left and became critics of liberal progressivism. For a brief time, the magazine&#x27;s Washington correspondent was Brit Hume, now working for Fox News. Former correspondent Eldridge Cleaver would continue his advocacy of black nationalism until his return to America from exile; from then on, Cleaver identified himself as a conservative Republican and Mormon. Sandra Levinson became a co-founder and executive director of the Center for Cuban Studies, and the founder and curator of the Cuban Art Space gallery.

== In popular culture ==

* The magazine is mentioned in the 1999 film &quot;The Insider&quot;. In the movie, Lowell Bergman, a former radical journalist with &quot;Rampart&quot; magazine who later started working for the CBS, was played by Al Pacino.

<text>Thomas Hall (May 25, 1936 – August 20, 2021), known professionally as Tom T. Hall and informally nicknamed &quot;The Storyteller&quot;, was an American country music singer-songwriter and short-story author. He wrote 12 No. 1 hit songs, with 26 more that reached the Top 10, including the No. 1 international pop crossover hit &quot;Harper Valley PTA&quot;, and &quot;I Love&quot;, which reached No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. He is included in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of 100 Greatest Songwriters. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2008, and the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame alongside his wife Dixie in 2018.

==Early life and career==
Hall was born on Tick Ridge, seven miles south of Olive Hill, Kentucky, on May 25, 1936. As a teenager, he organized a band called the Kentucky Travelers that performed before movies for a traveling theater. Hall enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1957, serving in Germany. While in the service, he performed over the Armed Forces Radio Network and wrote comic songs about army experiences. Following his discharge in 1961, he used G.I. Bill education benefits to enroll at Roanoke College, where he worked as a disc jockey. His early career included being an announcer at WRON, a local radio station in Ronceverte, West Virginia. Hall was also an announcer at WMOR (1330 AM) in Morehead and WGOH (1370 AM) in Grayson, both in Kentucky. Hall was also an announcer at WSPZ, which later became WVRC Radio in Spencer, West Virginia, in the 1960s.

Hall&#x27;s big songwriting break came in 1963, when country singer Jimmy C. Newman recorded his song &quot;DJ For a Day&quot;. In 1964, Hall moved to Nashville and started to work as a $50-a-week songwriter for Newkeys Music, the publishing company belonging to Newman and his business partner Jimmy Key, writing up to half a dozen country songs per day. Key suggested that he add the middle initial &quot;T&quot; to his name. Hall was nicknamed &quot;The Storyteller&quot;, and he composed songs for dozens of country music stars, including Johnny Cash, George Jones, Loretta Lynn, Waylon Jennings, Alan Jackson, and Bobby Bare. He also penned &quot;Hello Vietnam&quot;, a song that openly supported the Vietnam War at a time when war protest songs were beginning to dominate the pop music chart. The song proved to be a hit for country singer Johnnie Wright and was later used in the 1987 Vietnam War movie &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;.

One of Hall&#x27;s earliest successful songwriting ventures, &quot;Harper Valley PTA&quot;, recorded in 1968 by Jeannie C. Riley, hit No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and Hot Country Singles charts a week apart. It sold over six million copies and won both a Grammy Award and a CMA Award. The song would go on to inspire a motion picture and television program of the same name. Hall himself recorded the song for his album &quot;The Definitive Collection&quot; (as track No. 23). His recording career took off after Riley&#x27;s rendition of the song, and he released a number of hits from the late 1960s through the early 1980s. Some of his biggest hits include &quot;A Week in a Country Jail&quot;, &quot;(Old Dogs, Children and) Watermelon Wine&quot;, &quot;I Love&quot;, &quot;Country Is&quot;, &quot;The Year Clayton Delaney Died&quot;, &quot;I Like Beer&quot;, &quot;Faster Horses (the Cowboy and the Poet)&quot;, and &quot;That Song Is Driving Me Crazy&quot;. One of his best-known numbers, &quot;Pamela Brown&quot;, was recorded by Leo Kottke and became a staple of his performances. Hall is also noted for his child-oriented songs, including &quot;Sneaky Snake&quot; and &quot;I Care&quot;, the latter of which hit No. 1 on the country charts in 1975. His song &quot;I Love&quot;, in which the narrator lists the things in life that he loves, was recorded by Heathen Dan, with completely altered lyrics, as &quot;I Like&quot; and appeared many times on the Dr. Demento show in the early 1980s. Hall&#x27;s song was also used with altered lyrics and a hard rock arrangement in a popular 2003 TV commercial for Coors Light. In the mid- to late 1970s, Hall was a commercial spokesperson for Chevrolet trucks.

Hall succeeded Ralph Emery as host of the syndicated country music TV show &quot;Pop! Goes the Country&quot; in 1980 and continued until the series ended in 1982. Hall largely retired from writing new material in 1986 and from performing in 1994; his last public performance, which was also his first in several years, was in 2011.

==Awards and honors==
Hall won the Grammy Award for Best Album Notes in 1973 for the notes he wrote for his album &quot;Tom T. Hall&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;. He was nominated for, but did not win, the same award in 1976 for his album &quot;Greatest Hits Volume 2&quot;. He was a member of the Grand Ole Opry from 1971. In 1998 his 1972 song &quot;(Old Dogs, Children and) Watermelon Wine&quot; came in second in a BBC Radio 2 poll to find the UK&#x27;s favorite easy listening record, despite never having been a hit in the UK and being familiar to Radio 2 listeners mostly through occasional plays by DJ Terry Wogan.

Hall was inducted into the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame in 2002, and into the Country Music Hall of Fame on February 12, 2008. His wait for these honors was longer than anticipated; Hall attributed it to being somewhat reclusive and &quot;not well liked&quot; among the Nashville music industry, noting that he almost never collaborated with other songwriters and by the 1990s was largely out of step with the corporate style of country music.

On June 1, 2014, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;(Old Dogs, Children and) Watermelon Wine&quot; at No. 93 on its list of the 100 greatest country songs. In November 2018 Hall and his wife Dixie Hall were inducted together into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame. On June 13, 2019, Hall was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Of all the honors he had received in his lifetime, he considered this induction to be his proudest moment and the pinnacle of his achievement, also stating that he was taken by surprise for even being considered.

Together with his wife Dixie he won the Society for the Preservation of Bluegrass Music of America Bluegrass Song Writer of the Year award in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2015.

==Personal life==
Hall was married in 1961 to Opal &quot;Hootie&quot; McKinney, a native of Grayson, Kentucky. Their son, Dean Todd Hall, was born on June 11, 1961. Dean worked for his father in the early 1980s, first as a roadie and later as a guitarist. Dean has since worked as a solo artist and with Bobby Bare&#x27;s band.

Hall met bluegrass songwriter Dixie Deen in 1965 at a music industry award dinner to which she was invited for having written the song &quot;Truck Drivin&#x27; Son-of-a-Gun&quot;, which became a hit for Dave Dudley. Born Iris Lawrence in the West Midlands, England, in 1934, she emigrated to the U.S. in 1961 and married Hall in 1968, taking the name Dixie Hall. The two were married until her death on January 16, 2015. They lived in Franklin, Tennessee.

==Death==
At age 85, Hall died at his home in Franklin, Tennessee, on August 20, 2021, of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. The cause of death went unreleased and had been presumed to be natural until the Williamson County medical examiner released his findings in November. Hall left no suicide note.

<doc id="672645" wikidata="Q38874" url="?curid=672645" title="Peruvian Hairless Dog">
<text>&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The Peruvian Hairless Dog or is a Peruvian breed of hairless dog. It is the only living breed of dog indigenous to Peru.

As in other hairless breeds, coated examples can also occur. In hairless examples the skin may be any one of a wide variety of colors, with or without limited unpigmented areas, usually the legs, tail or chest; any hairs may be of any colour. In coated dogs, the coat may be of any colour but merle.

Hairless dogs are associated with the Andean civilizations. The modern breed is recognized as a part of the national cultural heritage.

== Naming ==

The dog has been known by many names, among them &quot;Allqu&quot; (in Inca times), , , (which may derive from , &#x27;woman&#x27;, rather than indicating a Chinese origin), , , , and .

== History ==

The Peruvian Hairless Dog is often perceived to be an Incan dog because it is known to have been kept during the Inca Empire (the Spaniards classified them as one of the six different breeds of dogs in the empire), they were also kept as pets in pre-Inca cultures from the Peruvian northern coastal zone. Ceramic hairless dogs from the Chimú, Moche, and Vicus culture are well known. Depictions of Peruvian hairless dogs appear around A.D. 750 on Moche ceramic vessels and continue in later Andean ceramic traditions.

Peruvian Hairless Dogs are now a symbol of Peru and part of its national heritage, celebrated in art and literature. The Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) accepted the breed and adopted an official breed standard.

Before that time, in the United States, some enthusiasts created another type of Peruvian hairless dog, the Peruvian Inca Orchid. The Peruvian Inca Orchid is recognized by the AKC and all recognized dogs are descendants of 13 dogs brought from Peru in the early 20th century.

In 2018, an analysis of DNA from the entire cell nucleus indicated that dogs entered North America from Siberia 4,500 years after humans did, were isolated for the next 9,000 years, and after contact with Europeans these no longer exist because they were replaced by Eurasian dogs. The pre-contact dogs exhibit a unique genetic signature that is now gone.

== Characteristics ==

According to the FCI breed standard, the most important aspect of its appearance is its hairlessness. Hairless dogs are often used in research for testing of various conditions such as dermatitis and other immune-related conditions. The dog may have short hair on top of its head, on its feet, and on the tip of its tail. In Peru, breeders tend to prefer completely hairless dogs. The color of skin can be chocolate-brown, elephant-grey, copper, or mottled. They can be totally one color or one color with tongue pink spots. Albinism is not accepted. The eye color is linked to the skin color. It is always brown, but dogs with light colors can have clearer eyes than darker-skinned dogs.

Peruvian Hairless Dogs come in three sizes:
*Small 25 – 40 cm (10 – 16 inches)
*Medium 40 – 50 cm (16 – 20 inches)
*Large 50 – 65 cm (20 – 26 inches)

Weight is also varied according to size :
*Small 4 – 8 kg (9 – 18 lbs)
*Medium 8 – 12 kg (18 – 26 lbs)
*Large 12 – 25 kg (26 – 55 lbs)

The dogs should be slim and elegant, with the impression of force and harmony, without being coarse. The ears should be candle-flame shaped and erect with the possibility to lay flat. Proportions of height (at withers) to length (withers to base of tail) are 1:1.
The gene that causes hairlessness also results in the dogs often having fewer teeth than other breeds, mostly lacking molars and premolars. 

The hairlessness trait is a dominant double lethal mutation , which means that homozygotic hairlessness does not exist. Homozygous embryos, those with two copies of the gene, do not develop in the womb. This results in an average birthrate of 2:1, hairless:coated.

<doc id="672652" wikidata="Q485071" url="?curid=672652" title="Analog watch">
<text>An analog watch (American) or analogue watch (UK and Commonwealth) is a watch whose display is not digital but rather analog with a traditional clock face. The name is an example of a retronym; it was coined to distinguish analog watches, which had simply been called &quot;watches&quot;, from newer digital watches. It strictly refers to the design of the display, regardless of the timekeeping technology used within the watch movement or module, although its counterpart, &quot;digital watch&quot;, usually connotes (in most minds) digital electronics in both. A digital watch is one in which the time is displayed as a series of digits, e.g. &quot;04:32&quot;. An analog watch is one in which the display is not digital, but is indicated (typically) by the continuous motion of one, two, or three rotating pointers or hands pointing to numbers arrayed on a circular dial (the hour hand&#x27;s movement being analogous to the path of the sun across the sky).

==Reading the time on an analog watch==
An analog watch has hands to show the time. One for the hours is short and thick. One for the minutes is long and thin. And sometimes one for the seconds which is long and very thin, this is clearly the second hand because it goes round 60 times faster than the minute hand and 720 times faster than the hour hand. Some Analog watches do not have numbers printed onto them; the numbers can still be determined because the strap is always at 12 &amp; 6. Often only the 12 o&#x27;clock position is marked, or only the 12, 3, 6 &amp; 9 positions.

==Using a watch and the sun as a compass==
An analog watch can be used to locate north and south. The Sun appears to move in the sky over a 24-hour period while the hour hand of a 12-hour clock takes twelve hours to complete one rotation. In the northern hemisphere, if the watch is rotated so that the hour hand points toward the Sun, the point halfway between the hour hand and 12 o&#x27;clock will indicate south. For this method to work in the southern hemisphere, the 12 is pointed toward the Sun and the point halfway between the hour hand and 12 o&#x27;clock will indicate north.

During daylight saving time, the same method can be employed using 1 o&#x27;clock instead of 12. There are relatively minor inaccuracies due to the difference between local time and zone time, and due to the equation of time. The method functions less well as one gets closer to the equator.

<doc id="672658" wikidata="Q201914" url="?curid=672658" title="Katla (volcano)">
<text>Katla () is an active subglacial volcano in southern Iceland. This volcano has been very active historically with at least twenty documented major eruptions since 2920 BC. In its recent history though, Katla has been less active as the last major eruption occurred in 1918. These eruptions have had a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of between 4 and 5 on a scale of 0 to 8. In comparison, the Eyjafjallajökull 2010 eruption had a VEI of 4. Larger VEI-5 eruptions are comparable to Mount St. Helens 1980 eruption. These eruptions have produced very large glacial outburst floods. Several smaller (minor) events measuring VEI-1 and below have occurred since. 

Katla is one of the largest volcanic sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) on Earth, accounting for up to 4% of total global volcanic carbon dioxide emissions. 

==Geography and physical appearances==
Katla is one of the largest volcanoes in Iceland. It is situated to the north of Vík í Mýrdal and to the east of the smaller glacier Eyjafjallajökull. Its peak reaches and is partially covered by the Mýrdalsjökull glacier. The system has an area of . The Eldgjá canyon is part of the same volcanic system, and extends as a fissure swarm to the north-east. The lavas from this eruption in 939 to 940 almost reach the south eastern coast, although are partially buried. 

The caldera of the Katla volcano has a diameter of and is covered with of ice. The volcano normally erupts every 40–80 years. The flood discharge at the peak of an eruption in 1755 has been estimated at 200,000–400,000 m3/s (7.1–14.1 million cu ft/sec), comparable to the combined average discharge of the Amazon, Mississippi, Nile, and Yangtze rivers (about 266,000 m3/s (9.4 million cu ft/sec)).

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Katla&quot; derives from the word &quot;&quot; (&quot;kettle&quot;), referring to the form of the volcano. &quot;Katla&quot; is also used as a female first name.

==Historic activity==

There have been up to twenty three eruptions recorded for Katla since 920 CE. Only two people are known to have died because of events directly associated with one of these eruptions in 1755. The 1918 eruption of Katla started on the late afternoon of the 12 October 1918 and lasted for 24 days, with the first day having the most dangerous events, including an extremely large flood with peak flow of . It has been graded a VEI 4 level eruption. The 1918 eruption resulted in extending the southern coast by due to laharic flood deposits. 

Most of these eruptions resulted in glacial floods (jökulhlaups). Some Mýrdalsjökull jökulhlaups have been associated with catastrophic flooding which results from peak discharges of more than , which is ten to a hundred times the size of most jökulhlaups. Apart from the 1755 and 1918 eruptions already mentioned in this regard, both of which like the majority of large floods drained onto the Mýrdalssandur plain to the volcanoes south-east, an eruption in 822 drained from the north-east aspect of the caldera down the Markarfljót river flood plain to the mountain&#x27;s south-west covering an area of . This is a convoluted route that outputs on to a large flood plain, the Markarfljótsaurar. Before the Hringvegur (Iceland&#x27;s Ring Road) was constructed in 1974, people feared traversing the plains in front of the volcano because of the frequent &quot;jökulhlaup&quot; (or glacier bursts) and the deep river crossings.

==Recent activity==

Katla has been showing signs of unrest since 1999, and geologists have concerns that it might erupt in the near future. The volcano’s present dormancy is among the longest in its known history. Particularly, monitoring has been intensified following the March 2010 eruptions of a smaller neighbouring volcano, the Eyjafjallajökull glacier. The eruption of this nearby long-dormant volcano in March and April 2010 prompted fears among some geophysicists that it might trigger an eruption at the larger and more dangerous Katla. In the past 1,000 years, all three known eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull have triggered subsequent Katla eruptions.

Following the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruptions, on 20 April 2010 Icelandic President Ólafur Grímsson said &quot;the time for Katla to erupt is coming close ... we [Iceland] have prepared ... it is high time for European governments and airline authorities all over Europe and the world to start planning for the eventual Katla eruption&quot;.

Increased earthquake activity had been noticed on Katla since the eruption at Eyjafjallajökull, but no other signs of an imminent eruption were observed. These quakes are located mainly on the northwestern rim of the caldera. On 9 October 2010, a sudden rise in harmonic tremor was observed in the stations around Katla, but although a sign of a possible impending eruption, none occurred.

=== 2011 activity ===
In 2011, geologic activity led many to speculate that a very small subglacial eruption had taken place. In June 2011, harmonic tremor was again detected at Katla volcano. A few days later, an earthquake swarm took place in the caldera, indicating magma movement inside the volcano, leading to increased fears of an eruption in the near future.

On 8 and 9 July, another spike in harmonic tremors occurred, as a small eruption of Katla took place. Cracks formed on the glacier, as well as a cauldron. Icelandic media reported a small subglacial eruption might have started. On the morning of 9 July, a glacier flood was reported in the river Múlakvísl, and also later in the river Skálm. The bridge across Múlakvísl was destroyed as well as other parts of the road, Route 1, on the Icelandic ring road. Helicopter pilots flying over the glacier also reported cracks in the glacier. Scientists monitoring the activity said speculation that it was caused by a &quot;very small&quot; subglacial eruption lacked confirmation by visual or seismic evidence.

=== 2016 and 2017 activity ===
Tremors were detected under Katla in late August 2016.

A &quot;Specialist Description&quot; describing the activity on 29 August 2016 noted that there was:... a seismic swarm in Mýrdalsjökull on the 29th of August with two events in the northern Katla caldera rim measured at magnitude 4.5. These are the biggest earthquakes in Katla volcano since 1977. Earthquake eruption checks confirmed that most earthquakes occurred between 0:40 and 1:50 PM. The big earthquakes were about thirty seconds apart at 1:47. They were followed by more than 50 aftershocks until 15:12 PM, when there was an earthquake of magnitude 3.3 and then the cycle and seismic activity in the region reduced again. No unrest was measured along these earthquakes. The geothermal has decreased in the following week and is now negligible.

An update written at 11 Sep 16:38 GMT reported:Today, shortly before 14:00, a small earthquake swarm began in Mýrdalsjökull. The largest earthquakes of the swarm were of magnitude 3.3 and 3.0 at 16:12 and 15:57. More than 10 smaller earthquakes were detected in the swarm. All of the earthquakes were shallow and located in the caldera of Katla volcano. It is not unusual for seismic swarms of this type to occur in this area.

In February 2017, seismic activity at the volcano continued.
== Other activity ==

As well as eruptions Katla is host to geothermal systems and these contribute to many of the smaller jökulhlaups from the mountain. Jökulhlaup triggering at Mýrdalsjökull may result from geothermal processes, and ice dams and their sudden removal by floating of the ice above a lake of melt water. Some eruptions could be secondary to the removal of overpressure by a jökulhlaup. There are currently at least 20 ice cauldrons known related to the geothermal areas within the caldera. These are often manifest as depressions in the ice cap rather than full thickness to the underlying rock cauldrons and have variable activity. Geothermal waters with a high volcanic mineral and gas content are produced and can result in both gas and water pollution.

== Risks ==
The area of the volcano contributes to the most serious natural hazard area of Iceland. The most likely large eruption had in 2019 a 89% probability of occurring within 30 years and would likely be associated with tephra production of about which can be compared with the that disrupted air travel from the second phase of the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull. It is most likely to occur in the months June to September, and be associated with a jökulhlaup flowing from Kotlujökull an outlet glacier to the south-east, over Mýrdalssandur to the sea where it could affect the town of Vík í Mýrdal. The 1755 and 1918 eruptions show that lightning and tephra fall are perceived as dangerous by humans in the immediate vicinity of a large eruption and have influenced jökulhlaup evacuation planning. Geothermal jökulhlaups can be large enough to damage property and infrastructure. 

=== Monitoring ===
Because of such risks the volcano is intensively monitored. The Icelandic Meteorological Office updates its website with reports of quakes both at Eyjafjallajökull and Katla. Continuous monitoring includes for seismic flood tremor, water gauges and water conductivity given the flood risk. The ice cauldrons of Mýrdalsjökull are also monitored.

==Folklore==

In folklore, the witch named Katla is held responsible for causing the &quot;jökulhlaup&quot; (outburst) of the Mýrdalsjökull glacier over the volcano; these events are dubbed (or &quot;Katla&#x27;s eruption&quot;). The folktale recorded by Jón Árnason in 1862 probably dates much older since it is set in the time of the , the Catholic monastery abolished c. 1550.

The short folktale entitled &quot;Katla eða Kötlugjá&quot; can be summarized as follows: In the pre-Reformation days when the Þykkvibær monastery was installed with an abbot, they had a cranky housekeeper there named Katla, well versed in (ancient) magic (), instilling fear in others. She owned a magical pair of breeches (, &#x27;trousers&#x27;), which allowed its wearer to run endlessly without fatigue, but herself reserved its use for an emergency. One day in autumn, the abbot&#x27;s shepherd Barði has trouble rounding up the sheep before master and the housekeep return from a banquet, and he borrows the breeches to retrieve the stray. Katla discovers the transgression and ambushes him, drowning him in a vat of sour whey (). But as winter wore on, the whey began to dwindle and Katla was heard muttering &quot;Barði will soon appear&quot;. Realizing the discovery of her crime and punishment was imminent, she put on her breeches and disappeared to the northwest, presumably diving straight into the glacier. Right afterwards a glacial outburst (&quot;jökulhlaup&quot;) occurred that rushed towards the monastery and .

Other geologic features such as (&#x27;Katla&#x27;s gorge&#x27;) and the surrounding area made desolate, named also bear names alluding to the Katla folklore.

<doc id="672675" wikidata="Q509417" url="?curid=672675" title="Battle of Korsun–Cherkassy">
<text>The Battle of Korsun–Cherkassy (; ), also known as the Battle of the Korsun–Cherkassy Pocket, was a World War II battle fought from 24 January to 16 February 1944 in the course of the Soviet Dnieper–Carpathian offensive in Ukraine following the Korsun–Shevchenkovsky offensive.

In the battle, the 1st and 2nd Ukrainian Fronts, commanded, respectively, by Nikolai Vatutin and Ivan Konev, encircled German forces of Army Group South in a pocket near the Dnieper River. During weeks of fighting, the two Red Army Fronts tried to eradicate the pocket. The encircled German units attempted a breakout in coordination with a relief attempt by other German forces, resulting in heavy casualties, estimates of which vary.

The Soviet victory in the Korsun–Cherkassy offensive marked the successful implementation of Soviet deep operations. Soviet deep battle doctrine envisaged the breaking of the enemy&#x27;s forward defences to allow fresh operational reserves to exploit the breakthrough by driving into the strategic depth of the enemy front. The arrival of large numbers of American- and British-built trucks and halftracks gave the Soviet forces much greater mobility than they had had before. This, coupled with the Soviet capacity to hold large formations in reserve gave the Red Army the ability to drive deep behind German defenses again and again.

Though the Soviet operation at Korsun did not result in the collapse in the German front that the Soviet command had hoped for, it marked a significant deterioration in the strength available to the German army on that front, especially in heavy weaponry, nearly all of which was lost during the breakout. Through the rest of the war the Red Army would place large German forces in jeopardy, while the Germans were stretched thin and constantly attempting to extract themselves from one crisis to the next. Mobile Soviet offensives were the hallmark of the Eastern front for the remainder of the war.

==January 1944==
In the autumn of 1943, the German forces of Field Marshal Erich von Manstein&#x27;s Army Group South including General Otto Wöhler&#x27;s 8th Army had fallen back to the Panther–Wotan line, a defensive position that in Ukraine followed the Dnieper river. However, when the German forces arrived, construction had only just been started, so the defensive positions essentially did not exist.

By 1 December 1943, the line had been broken and the Soviet Army had crossed the Dnieper in force. Only two corps, the XI under General Wilhelm Stemmermann, the XLII Army Corps under Lieutenant General Theobald Lieb and the attached Corps Detachment B from the 8th Army were holding a salient in the new Soviet line. The salient to the west of Cherkassy extended some 100 kilometers to the Dnieper river settlement of Kanev, with the town of Korsun roughly in the center of the salient, with the 1st Ukrainian Front to its left and the 2nd Ukrainian Front to its right.

Marshal of the Soviet Union Georgy Zhukov realized the potential for destroying Wöhler&#x27;s 8th Army, using tactics similar to those used to encircle and destroy Paulus&#x27;s 6th Army in the Battle of Stalingrad. Zhukov recommended to the Soviet Supreme Command (Stavka) deploying the 1st and 2nd Ukrainian Fronts to form two armored rings of encirclement: an inner ring around the pocket, followed by the destruction of the forces it contained, and an external ring to prevent relief formations from reaching the surrounded units. Despite repeated warnings from Manstein and others, Hitler refused to allow the exposed units to be pulled back.

General Konev held a conference at his headquarters at Boltushki on 15 January with his commanders and their political commissars to pass on the orders received from Stavka. The initial attack was to be conducted by Konev&#x27;s own 2nd Ukrainian Front from the southeast by the 53rd Army and 4th Guards Army, with the 5th Guards Tank Army to exploit penetrations, supported by the 5th Air Army, to be joined in progress by the 52nd Army, 5th Guards Cavalry Corps and 2nd Tank Army. Additionally, from Vatutin&#x27;s 1st Ukrainian Front, the 27th and 40th Armies were to be deployed from the northwest, with the 6th Tank Army to exploit penetrations, supported by the 2nd Air Army. Many of these formations had received an inflow of new personnel. Red Army planning further included extensive deception operations that the Soviets claimed were successful; however, the German 8th Army war diary shows clearly that the German staffs were concerned about the threat at hand.

==Encirclement==

The Soviet attack started on 24 January when Konev&#x27;s 2nd Ukrainian Front attacked the salient from the southeast. A breakthrough was quickly achieved, and the penetration was exploited by the 5th Guards Tank Army and the 5th Guards Cavalry Corps the following day. Despite the awareness of the German 8th Army&#x27;s staff that an attack was imminent, they were surprised by the appearance of the 1st Ukrainian Front&#x27;s newly formed 6th Tank Army. The 6th Tank Army, with 160 tanks and 50 self-propelled guns, was inexperienced and took longer than expected to penetrate the western flank of the salient. A &quot;mobile group&quot; from the 5th Mechanized Corps&#x27; 233rd Tank Brigade, under the command of General Savelev, with 50 tanks and 200 sub-machine gun armed infantrymen, occupied Lysyanka and moved into the outskirts of Zvenyhorodka by 28 January. Here, these troops of the 6th Tank Army met the 2nd Ukrainian Front&#x27;s 20th Tank Corps. Over the next three days, the two tank armies formed a thinly manned outer ring around what was now the Korsun Pocket while another, inner, ring was formed by the Soviet 27th, 52nd, and 4th Guard Armies.

The Soviet commanders were optimistic about the progress of the operation. Stalin was promised a second Stalingrad, and he expected it. Konev wired: &quot;There is no need to worry, Comrade Stalin. The encircled enemy will not escape.&quot; Inside the pocket were nearly 60,000 men from six German divisions, at about 55% of their authorized strength, along with a number of smaller combat units. Among the trapped German forces were the 5th SS Panzer Division &quot;Wiking&quot;, with the attached 5th SS Infantry Brigade &quot;Wallonien&quot;, the Estonian SS infantry battalion &quot;Narwa&quot;, and &quot;several thousand&quot; Russian auxiliaries. General Wilhelm Stemmermann, the commander of the XI Corps, was placed in command of the forces in the pocket. These forces were designated &quot;Gruppe Stemmermann&quot;. The 5th SS Panzer Division, with some 11,400 personnel, had 30 operational Panzer III/IV tanks and assault guns left, and six more under repair. The division further had 47 artillery pieces, of which 12 were self-propelled guns.

==German relief attacks==

Manstein moved quickly, and by early February the III and XLVII Panzer Corps were assembled for a relief effort. Hitler intervened, however, and ordered the attack be transformed into an effort to counter-encircle the two Soviet army groups.

General Hermann Breith, commander of the III Panzer Corps, requested the relief formations be united to attempt to force a corridor to the encircled &quot;Gruppe Stemmermann&quot;. This request was refused, and the counter-encirclement of the Soviet forces was attempted. The attack by the XLVII Panzer Corps&#x27; 11th Panzer Division on the southeastern flank of the pocket quickly stalled, as it had only 27 tanks and 34 assault guns operational. The III Panzer Corps&#x27; attempt continued until 8 February, when it became undeniable that the effort had failed. Manstein ordered the corps to instead drive directly to the relief of &quot;Gruppe Stemmermann&quot;. Pulling the III Panzer Corps back and reorganizing for the new attack 15 kilometers south of Boyarka took three days.

On 11 February, Breith began a push with the 16th and 17th Panzer Divisions driving toward the Gniloy Tikich River. They initially made good progress. The 1st Panzer Division and 1st SS Panzer Division LSSAH covered the northern flank of the drive. As they drove deeper into the Soviet positions, Zhukov ordered Vatutin to assemble four tank corps with the goal of cutting off the attacking German spearhead. The weather warmed, turning the roads to a soft mud and bogging down German progress. Here the liabilities of Germany&#x27;s wheeled vehicles became evident. The Soviet forces had been provided lend-lease U.S. built four-wheel and six-wheel drive trucks. These were largely able to get through, whereas German two-wheel-drive vehicles were not.

Konev issued orders for the 4th Guards Army and 5th Guards Cavalry Corps to attempt to split the pocket on the night of 5–6 February. The strike was to fall on the boundary between the two German corps. As fighting progressed, the Soviet goal became clear to Stemmermann and Lieb. Stemmermann ordered the 5th SS Division&#x27;s armor to the scene. Together with the 72nd Infantry Division, it brought the Soviet attack to a halt, buying the Germans time. Red Army efforts were renewed between 7–10 February. This effort was hobbled by supply shortages. The III Panzer Corps&#x27; penetrations toward the Gniloy Tikich River made the supply lines for Soviet formations such as Vatutin&#x27;s 6th Tank Army much longer. The Red Air Force attempted to resupply some units using Polikarpov Po-2 aircraft. Despite logistical difficulties, units from the 2nd Ukrainian Front were able to close in on Korsun by 10 February, collapsing the pocket to an area of six by seven miles.

==German maneuver within the pocket==

On 11 February, the III Panzer Corps continued its drive east. The force reached the Gniloy Tikich River and established a small bridgehead on the eastern bank. It was unable to advance further, meaning that Group Stemmermann had to fight its way out.

Both sides realized that the Wehrmacht relief efforts had reached a critical stage. Despite heavy Soviet propaganda inducements, very few German soldiers and no Waffen-SS men in the cauldron had surrendered. Zhukov thus decided to send &quot;parlementaires&quot; under a white flag with surrender demands. Red Army emissaries presented letters for both Stemmermann and Lieb signed by Marshal Zhukov and Generals Konev and Vatutin. After cordial talks, refreshments and a handshake, the Soviet delegation departed without a positive answer.
The German air force mounted an aerial resupply operation to both the encircled forces and the German relief columns. On 28 January, the VIII Aviation Corps deployed 832 transport aircraft, 478 bombers (from which supplies were dropped at low altitude), 58 fighter bombers, and 168 fighters. Over the course of the operation, 32 transport aircraft, 13 bombers, and five fighters were lost. After the Korsun airfield was abandoned on 12 February, deliveries were dropped in by parachute.

The Luftwaffe delivered 82,948 gallons of fuel, 868 tons of ammunition and four tons of medical supplies to the encircled forces and 325 tons of ammunition, 74,289 gallons of fuel and 24 tons of food to spearheads of the relief formations, as well as evacuating 4,161 wounded while the Korsun airfield remained operational. The operation had only met about half (78 tons) of the daily requirements (150 tons) of the encircled troops as estimated by the German 8th Army headquarters.

Stemmermann began withdrawing troops from the north side of the pocket, reorienting the thrust of the escape direction, and attacking south to move toward the relief forces on the north bank of the Gniloy Tikich. The encircled forces aimed to capture the villages of Novo-Buda, Komarovka, Khilki and Shanderovka at the southwestern perimeter of the pocket to reach a favorable jump-off line for the breakout. On 11 and 12 February, elements of the 72nd Infantry Division captured Novo-Buda and Komarovka, respectively. On the evening of 15 February, Khilki was secured, against a Soviet counterattack. However, of all the German divisions in the pocket, the 5th SS Panzer Division contributed the most to continued operations. Since the SS Division Wiking was the only truly mobile force inside the pocket, the division&#x27;s tracked units were repeatedly shifted from one end of the pocket to the other to shore up crumbling lines.

The pocket had &quot;wandered&quot; south and half-way toward the relief force and rested on the village of Shanderovka. The settlement was heavily defended by the Soviets; it was captured by 72nd Infantry troops, retaken by units of the Soviet 27th Army and recaptured by the &quot;Germania&quot; regiment of 5th SS Panzer Division. By nightfall on 16 February, the III Panzer Corps fought its way closer to the encircled formations, with spearheads now seven kilometers from Group Stemmermann.

==Appeal from the NKFD==

The pocket led to an attempt by the Soviet Union to enlist the National Committee for a Free Germany (NKFD) and the League of German Officers (BDO) in order to convince the German troops to surrender. The prisoners of war and BDO members Generals Walther von Seydlitz-Kurzbach, Alexander Edler von Daniels and Otto Korfes visited the front on 10 February and made a personal appeal to the German commanders. Appeals were also made on the radio. More to it, the members of the NKFD were sent to the battlefield where they spead NKFD leaflets which served as safe conduct passes into captivity showing that the surrender is voluntary and that the soldiers with such leaflets should be handed over to the NKFD. The operation was relatively successful, and out of the 18 200 captured Germans each third produced an NKFD leaflet. Despite the failure to alter the fighting resolution of the German Commander at Cherkassy, this operation raised the profile of the NKFD and BDO among both the Allies and Axis. Von Seydlitz was dismissed from the army and sentenced to death in absentia and Hitler personally authorized Sippenhaft against his family.

==Breakout attempt==

The northward thrust toward the pocket by the III Panzer Corps had been halted by Red Army determination, terrain and fuel shortages. After several failed attempts by German armored formations to seize and hold Hill 239 ( Lysyanka, Cherkasy Oblast, Ukraine) and advance on Shanderovka, Soviet counterattacks by the 5th Guards Tank Army forced the III Panzer Corps into costly defensive fighting. The 8th Army radioed Stemmermann: &quot;Capacity for action by III Panzer Corps limited by weather and supply situation. Gruppe Stemmermann must perform breakthrough as far as the line Zhurzintsy–Hill 239 by its own effort. There link up with III Panzer Corps.&quot;

The message did not specify that Zhurzintsy and the hill were still firmly in Soviet hands—a failure that caused Group Stemmermann severe casualties during the German breakout of the pocket. General Lieutenant Lieb was appointed by the 8th Army to lead the breakout. In the seven kilometers that separated Group Stemmermann and the III Panzer Corps, Konev was positioning his forces for an attack slated for 17 February. His three armies – the 4th Guards, 27th, 52nd and 5th Guards Cavalry Corps – surrounded the encircled German forces. The Red Army force also included elements of the 5th Guards Tank Army, with its armor placed in the area that separated Group Stemmermann and the III Panzer Corps.

Stemmermann elected to stay behind with a rearguard of 6,500 men, the remaining combined strength of the 57th and 88th Infantry Divisions. The pocket was at this point just five kilometers in diameter, with no room to maneuver. Shanderovka, once seen as a viable escape route, became known as &quot;Hell&#x27;s Gate&quot;. The Red Army subjected the area to intense artillery and rocket fire, while the Red Air Force ground attack aircraft bombed and strafed the encircled troops, only infrequently challenged by the Luftwaffe. Various unit diaries described a scene of gloom, with fires caused by Soviet night bombing with incendiaries, destroyed or abandoned vehicles everywhere and wounded men and disorganized units on muddy roads. Konev ordered Cossack cavalry units to perform sabre attacks on the disorganised German units. Ukrainian civilians were caught between the combatants. On 16 February 1944, Manstein, without waiting for a decision by Hitler, sent a radio message to Stemmermann to authorize the breakout: &quot;Password Freedom, objective Lysyanka, 2300 hours.&quot;
With extreme reluctance, Stemmermann and Lieb decided to leave 1,450 non-ambulatory wounded at Shanderovka, attended by doctors and orderlies. The troops then began to assemble at dusk into three assault columns, with Division Group 112 to the north, the 5th SS Panzer Division to the south and the 72nd Division in the center, with the reinforced 105th Regiment in the first echelon to provide assault power. Several battalions and regiments reached the German lines at Oktyabr by 0410. The 105th entered Lysyanka at 0630.

At the left flank column, a reconnaissance patrol returned with the news that Hill 239 was occupied by Soviet T-34 tanks of the 5th Guards Tank Army. The high ground had to be bypassed. The direction of the German retreat had to veer off to the south toward the Gniloy Tikich River. When daylight arrived, the German breakout plan began to unravel. Very few armored vehicles and other heavy equipment could climb the slippery, thawing hillsides and the weapons had to be destroyed and abandoned.

General Konev, now aware of the German breakout, resolved to keep his promise to Stalin not to let the German forces escape. Soviet intelligence, however, at this stage vastly overestimated the armored strength of the III Panzer Corps, and Konev therefore proceeded in force. At this time, the 20th Tank Corps brought its brigade of the new Joseph Stalin-2s to the Korsun battlefield. Konev ordered all available armor and artillery to attack the escaping units, cut them into isolated groups and then destroy them piecemeal. The two blocking Soviet rifle divisions, the 206th Rifle and 5th Guards Airborne, had been smashed by the German assault forces; without infantry support Soviet tanks then fired into the German formations from a distance. With no anti-tank weapons in the field, T-34s commenced to wade into support troops, headquarters units, stragglers and Red-Cross identified medical columns.

By mid-day, the majority of the now intermingled divisions had reached the Gniloy Tikich stream, 15 meter wide and two meters deep due to melting snow. Despite the fact that the 1st Panzer Division had captured a bridge and engineers had erected another, the panicking men saw the river as their only escape. Since the main body was away and south of the bridgeheads, the last tanks, trucks and wagons were driven into the water, trees were felled to form makeshift bridges and the troops floundered across, with hundreds of men drowning, being swept downstream with horses and military debris. Many others succumbed to shock or hypothermia. Toward the end phase of the breakout, engineers had built several more bridges and rear guard units of the 57th and 88th Infantry Divisions crossed the river &quot;dry&quot;, including 20 horse-drawn wagons with about 600 wounded.

That many escaped back to the German lines at Lysyanka was due in great measure to the exertions of the III Panzer Corps as it drove in relief of Group Stemmermann. The unit was equipped with Tigers and Panthers and an engineer battalion with specialist bridging skills.

==Outcome==
The Red Army encirclement of Cherkassy–Korsun inflicted serious damage on six German divisions, including the 5th SS Panzer Division. Though most of the trapped men escaped, they had to leave nearly all of their heavy equipment behind. These units had to be withdrawn for rest and near complete re-equipping. The escaped wounded were transported from collection points near Uman to rehabilitation areas and hospitals in Poland, and were then sent on leave to their home towns.
In a U.S. Army brief written following the war, Lieb commented that when he assumed command of Force Stemmermann:
The 72nd and Wiking Divisions were completely intermingled. No longer did they have any tanks, artillery, vehicles or rations. Many soldiers were entirely without weapons, quite a few even without footgear. Neither division could be considered in any way able to fight. One regiment of Task Force B was intact and still had some artillery support. However, this regiment also had no vehicles and no rations left. All wounded, estimated at about 2,000, (...) were evacuated by air.&quot; He also stated: &quot;For lack of vehicles and fuel, III Panzer Corps was unable to reinforce its units in the area of Lisyanka and Oktyabr. [It] had no extra supplies of any kind, and his forward elements were unable to provide rations for the troops emerging from the pocket.
With German armored reserves drawn to the Korsun Pocket, the Soviets struck Army Group South in two other sectors. The 13th and 60th Armies (General Vatutin&#x27;s 1st Ukrainian Front) advanced south of the Pripiat&#x27; Marshes, capturing the remnants of the German XIII Corps at the Battle of Rovno and advancing to Lutsk. To the south, the 3rd and 4th Ukrainian Fronts (Generals Malinovsky and Tolbukhin) attacked along the bend of Dnepr River, capturing Kryvyi Rih.

General Stemmermann was killed during the breakout when his command car was hit by a Soviet antitank gun. General Lieb survived the war. General Vatutin was shot by Ukrainian Nationalist UPA insurgents on 29 February 1944 and died on 15 April. The commander of 2nd Ukrainian Front, General Konev, was made a Marshal of the Soviet Union for his victory at Korsun. Konev also survived the war.

==Assessment==

The battle around Korsun was a major Soviet victory that enabled later advances the next spring into Romania. An entire German army became trapped, and as the pocket collapsed the forces inside were forced to retreat through gaps in the Soviet forces surrounding them, resulting in significant losses in men and tremendous losses in equipment.

Hitler&#x27;s insistence on holding the exposed salient strongly limited the options of German field commanders. Once the Soviets had encircled the German forces, relief efforts produced mixed results. The effectiveness of the German counterattack was limited by Hitler&#x27;s plan for splitting his strength to attempt a counter envelopment. The XLVII Panzer Corps&#x27; attacks were ineffective due to the weakness of its divisions. Though the III Panzer Corps was far more effective, the corps wasted a week on a failed attempt to encircle the Soviet forces. When it was finally given the mission of relieving &quot;Gruppe Stemmermann&quot;, the Germans were unable to provide Bäke&#x27;s heavy tank regiment with adequate fuel supplies, leading Bäke to stop his advance on Hill 239 because one group of his tanks had run out of fuel. This logistical failure was compounded by the vagueness of the radio message to General Stemmermann ordering the breakout attempt. Hill 239 remained under Soviet control, resulting in significant casualties among Stemmermann&#x27;s retreating force.

The Soviet performance was also beset by errors. Soviet intelligence on German forces in the pocket was faulty in overestimating their strength. At the same time, the Soviets underestimated German capability for a counterattack and hurriedly moved more forces forward to bolster the strength of their encircling rings. The Soviet air force was unable to significantly hinder the German aerial resupply effort. Ultimately, the encircling forces were unable to prevent a German breakout, allowing a significant portion of the trapped Germans to escape. Given the initial circumstances of the battle, the degree of Soviet losses makes it clear that while the Soviets won at Korsun, it was a victory that came at a high price.

Soviet sources and testimonials from the front line assert that the total loss in German men was catastrophic, with estimates collected from mass graves and the battlefield accounting for roughly 55,000 dead and 18,000 German prisoners from the encircled formations alone. German sources differ on total losses, holding that of the 60,000 men originally inside the pocket, the number had shrunk to less than 50,000 by 16 February. 45,000 of these took part in the breakout, resulting in 27,703 German soldiers and 1,063 Russian auxiliaries breaking out unscathed. Total casualties killed, wounded or missing, were claimed at 31,000, yet these numbers do not count losses from the rescuing forces. German official documents listed total escapees as 40,423, including the wounded flown out of the pocket and evacuated from Lysyanka. While there were claims that &quot;roughly two out of three&quot; encircled men succeeding in escaping the pocket, &quot;almost one third of their men [were either] dead or wounded.&quot;

Soviet sources tally losses of 80,188 casualties for the 1st and 2nd Ukrainian Fronts, with 24,286 killed and missing, and 55,902 wounded. These losses were incurred over the period of 24 January – 17 February 1944 during both the encirclements and the breakout attempts.

==Use in propaganda==
Both sides hailed the events at Korsun as a victory. Marshal Konev claimed to have inflicted 130,000 German casualties, an assertion that German official history dismissed. Soviet historian Sergey Smirnov described the victory at Korsun as a &quot;Stalingrad on the Dnieper,&quot; and the victory was hailed as a culmination of Soviet armored strength against the ailing Wehrmacht. Marshal Zhukov disliked being overshadowed by his rival, noting that on 18 February 1944, official honors were given in Moscow to the 2nd Ukrainian Front—but not the 1st Ukrainian Front—&quot;an unforgivable error of the part of the supreme commander [Stalin]&quot;.

On the part of the Germans, the counterattack was depicted as a glorious success in which one group of brave German soldiers freed their equally heroic comrades who had been trapped in the pocket. However, General von Vormann, who commanded the relief attempt of the XLVII Panzer Corps, bitterly noted that &quot;the troops who took part were astonished and unbelieving when they were told they had won a great victory at Cherkassy in the Ukraine in 1944.&quot; The German high command was relieved that many troops were able to escape. Adolf Hitler supposedly only complained briefly about the amount of equipment that had to be left behind.

==Historiography==
One of the initial historiographical works on the fighting at Korsun was a 1952 U.S. Army publication, DA Pamphlet 20–234, &quot;Operations of Encircled Forces: German Experiences in Russia&quot;. This work was written in the context of NATO&#x27;s Cold War confrontation with the Soviet Union, and the authors highlighted the historical experience of the Wehrmacht which might prove useful to NATO forces had a war between the Soviet Union and the NATO countries broken out. Like most of the English-language works on the Eastern Front of this era, it was written from the German point of view and without the benefit of wartime records.

John Erickson&#x27;s 1983 &quot;The Road to Berlin&quot; and David Glantz&#x27;s 1995 (2015) &quot;When Titans Clashed&quot; covered events on the entire Eastern Front from a German and Soviet perspective, and devoted several pages to the fighting in the Korsun Pocket. Erickson did not question Soviet claims regarding German casualties, and Glantz questioned the veracity of German claims regarding the total of escapees from the pocket. Glantz has also translated the Soviet General Staff Study on the Korsun Operation into English as &quot;The Battle for the Ukraine: The Red Army&#x27;s Korsun&#x27;-Shevchenkovkii Operation, 1944&quot;.

More recently, the 2002 work by U.S. Army historian Douglas Nash, &quot;Hell&#x27;s Gate: The Battle of the Cherkassy Pocket, January–February 1944&quot;, took issue with Soviet claims that Korsun was another Stalingrad. Similarly, the Swedish historians Niklas Zetterling and Anders Frankson disputed the assertions of the Soviet General Staff Study of the Korsun Operation in their 2008 work, &quot;The Korsun Pocket. The Encirclement and Breakout of a German Army in the East, 1944&quot;, describing the staff study as &quot;anything but accurate&quot; and &quot;completely unreliable.&quot; Both Nash and Zetterling/Frankson conclude that Korsun was a Soviet victory.

In 2007, Volume 8 of the German semiofficial history of the war (&quot;Germany and the Second World War&quot;) was published, and part of the work authored by Karl-Heinz Frieser addressed the events at Korsun. This work also doubts Soviet claims regarding the German casualties while discussing the situation of the German forces in detail, using available data from the German archives. However, while German casualties in this work are taken from German archives, it bases its assessment of Soviet AFV and gun losses (uncritically) on German wartime claims. In 2011 author and historian Jean Lopez published, on Economica Edition ( ) a book named &quot;Le chaudron de Tcherkassy-Korsun &quot;, covering the battle.

<doc id="672686" wikidata="Q5280299" url="?curid=672686" title="Direct Subsidy Scheme">
<text>The Direct Subsidy Scheme (DSS) is instituted by the Education Bureau of Hong Kong to enhance the quality of private schools at the primary and secondary levels. The Hong Kong government has been encouraging non-government secondary schools which have attained a sufficiently high educational standard to join the DSS by providing subsidies to enhance the quality of private school education since the 1991–92 school year. In the 2000–01 school year, the DSS was extended to primary schools. In the 2001–02 school year, the terms of the DSS were significantly improved to attract more schools to join the scheme. Under the scheme, schools are free to decide on their curriculum, fees, and entrance requirements.

==Standard==
Non-government schools must satisfy stipulated standards to be eligible to join the scheme. The standards include requirements regarding the mode of operation (unisessional), class size, teacher&#x27;s qualifications and facilities. For example, schools need a permanent school premises, more than 70 per cent of teachers had to be degree-holders, and they had to have sufficient facilities such as computer, music and language labs.

==Curricula==
DSS schools are free to design their own curriculum. They are not subject to the guidelines issued by the Education Department. Although DSS schools are required to offer principally a curriculum targeting local students and prepare its students to sit for local examinations, certain DSS schools are currently offering or are set to offer International Baccalaureate programmes.

==Admission==
DSS schools are generally free to select their own students, subject to special arrangements with the government in case of shortage of places in government/aided schools. However, DSS schools are not allowed to select their students by conducting written entrance tests.

==Financing==
DSS schools are free to charge school fees. In the 2009–10 school year, their schools fees range from $3,000 to $110,000 per year.

A DSS school will receive full recurrent subsidy until its fee level reaches 2 1/3 times the average unit cost of an aided school place. Beyond this level, no recurrent subsidy is available. The average unit cost of an aided school place is calculated based on a two-age based system to address the needs of schools with longer development background. In short, a higher level of subsidy would be available to DSS schools that have been operating for 16 years or above. The level of recurrent subsidy received by a DSS school is hence dependent on the number of students enrolled in that particular school.

Also, to help ex-aided DSS schools adapt to new financing methods, ex-aided DSS schools that receive less recurrent subsidy after joining the DSS will continue to receive recurrent subsidy as if they were aided schools for 5 years.

To cater for students from less well-off families, DSS schools are required to set aside at least 10% of their income for fee / scholarship schemes. In addition, for every dollar charged over two-thirds of the average unit cost of an aided school place, the school should set aside 50 cents for scholarship and financial assistance schemes.

==Administration==
DSS schools are required by the government to issue annual prospectuses, which must contain stipulated classes of information such as vision, mission and objectives of the school; class structure; curriculum; achievements in public exams; extra curricula activities; and school fees. DSS schools are free to spend their grants for educational purposes, subject to inspection of their audited accounts. Ex-aided DSS schools will be given an option to revert to aided status only if the government changes the formula for calculating DSS subsidy such that the school financial viability is adversely affected.

==Controversy==
Pegasus Philip Wong Kin Hang Christian Primary School, a DSS school, sparked controversy in 2009 when the sponsoring body pulled out, and irregularities in its accounts were revealed. The school management committee agreed to pay an advance payment of two to three weeks to Pegasus Social Service Christian Organization, the sponsoring body, which is also the school&#x27;s service provider and chaired by school supervisor Carmen Leung Suk-ching. The government&#x27;s monitoring mechanism over DSS schools has therefore been criticised by legislators.

Some DSS schools have also come under criticism for raising school fees despite the economic downturn.

The scheme has also been criticised as benefiting the private education sector and the well-off students at the expense of the public sector.

<text>The Eagle Has Landed is a book by British writer Jack Higgins, set during World War II and first published in 1975. It was quickly adapted into a British film of the same name, released in 1976.

==Plot==
The book makes use of the false document technique, and opens with Higgins describing his discovery of the concealed grave of thirteen German paratroopers in an English graveyard. The characters discuss the historic rescue of Hitler&#x27;s ally Benito Mussolini in September 1943. After Mussolini was deposed and imprisoned by the Italian government, Otto Skorzeny led a German team and achieved his release and escape from Italy. 

Adolf Hitler, with the strong support of Heinrich Himmler, considered a similar plan to kidnap the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, head of the Abwehr (German military intelligence), is ordered to make a feasibility study of capturing Churchill and taking him to the Reich. Canaris realises that although Hitler will soon forget the matter, Himmler will not. Fearing Himmler may try to discredit him, Canaris orders one of his officers, Oberst Radl, to undertake the study, despite feeling that it is all a waste of effort.

An Unteroffizier on Radl&#x27;s staff finds that one of their spies, codenamed &quot;Starling&quot;, has provided a tantalising piece of intelligence. &quot;At any other time, in any other place, this information would be useless,&quot; Radl said. &quot;And then synchronicity rears its disturbing head.&quot; Churchill is scheduled to spend a relaxing weekend at a country house near the village of Studley Constable, Norfolk, where Joanna Grey, an Afrikaner woman and longtime Abwehr agent, lives. She detests England because she was abused and raped by British soldiers, and her husband, daughter, and parents were killed during the Second Boer War. As a result of her reports, Radl devises a detailed plan to intercept Churchill and transport him to Germany. Although Radl is certain the plan has real possibilities, Admiral Canaris orders him to abandon it.

Himmler, however, has already learned of the scheme and summons Radl. He orders him to proceed, but without informing Canaris. In response, Radl arranges for Liam Devlin, a member of the Irish Republican Army who served as an officer in the Lincoln Battalion in the Spanish Civil War, to be smuggled to Norfolk by way of Northern Ireland. Posing as a wounded veteran of the British Army, he contacts Mrs. Grey, who arranges a position for him as gamekeeper to the estate of Studley Grange. While awaiting further developments, Devlin becomes romantically involved with Molly Prior, a girl from the village.

Meanwhile, Radl selects the members of the &quot;commando style&quot; unit, to be led by disgraced Fallschirmjäger commander Lieutenant Colonel Kurt Steiner, which is supposed to carry out the operation. While returning from the Eastern Front, Steiner had intervened when SS soldiers were rounding up Jews at a railway station in Poland. To the outrage of the SS and Polizei, he took one of their men hostage and helped a teenage Jewish girl to escape on a passing freight train. For this he was court-martialled, along with his men, who backed his actions. Too highly decorated to face a firing squad, Steiner and his men were allowed to transfer to a penal unit in the Channel Islands. There they are forced to make high-risk attacks with human torpedoes against Allied ships in the English Channel.

Radl travels to Alderney and recruits Steiner and his surviving men. Steiner&#x27;s father, General Steiner, is being tortured by the Gestapo for his alleged ties to the German Resistance. This serves as an additional incentive for the Colonel to accept the mission. Radl relocates Steiner and his men to an airfield on the north western coast of Holland, where they familiarise themselves with the British weapons and equipment they will be using. The team will be air-dropped into Norfolk from a captured C-47 Dakota with Allied markings. The commandos outfit themselves as Free Polish paratroopers, as few of them speak English; the plan is to infiltrate Studley Constable, capture Churchill, rendezvous with an E-boat at the nearby coast, and make their escape. As part of the ruse, they arm themselves with Sten guns, M1 Garands, Bren guns and revolvers, as well as Browning Hi-Powers, instead of German weaponry.

At first, the plan seems to go off without a hitch. But one of Steiner&#x27;s NCOs rescues a young girl who fell into a mill race. He is killed by the water wheel and his German uniform (worn under the Polish uniforms, as protection against being executed as spies) is seen by several of the villagers. Determined to continue the mission, Steiner arranges for the locals to be rounded up, but the sister of Father Vereker, the local priest, escapes and alerts a nearby unit of US Army Rangers. Colonel Robert Shafto, an inexperienced but glory-seeking officer, rallies his forces to retake the hostages. Without notifying headquarters, he orders a foolhardy assault in which many Americans are killed. After the Colonel is shot in the head by Mrs. Grey, Major Harry Kane, Shafto&#x27;s Executive officer in the Rangers, organises a second, successful attack.

Steiner, his second-in-command Ritter von Neumann, and Devlin escape with Molly&#x27;s aid. Determined to finish the mission, Steiner allows Devlin and Neumann to escape without him and decides to make one last attempt at Churchill. He succeeds in reaching Churchill, but hesitates, is shot and supposedly killed. (However, Steiner reappears alive in &quot;The Eagle Has Flown&quot;, a quasi-sequel.) In Germany, Radl has had a heart attack, implied to be fatal. At about the same time, Himmler, upon discovering that the mission has failed, orders Radl&#x27;s arrest for high treason.

This account is surrounded by a frame story with a prologue and epilogue, a technique that Higgins uses in other of his novels. The author, whilst doing historical research in Norfolk, supposedly meets various surviving characters.The final revelation comes from an aged and terminally ill Father Vereker: at the time of his supposed visit to Norfolk, Churchill was en route to the Tehran Conference. The &quot;Churchill&quot; whom Steiner nearly killed was an impersonator, meaning that even if Steiner had fatally shot the man, the government would not have been affected.

==Characters==
* Lt. Colonel Kurt Steiner – Steiner is a veteran of the Invasion of Norway, Albert Canal, the Battle of Crete, Leningrad, Stalingrad and Ukraine.

* Harvey Preston – A SS British Free Corps officer attached to Steiner&#x27;s unit to add credibility. A convinced Nazi, and a convicted con-man prior to his enlistment, Preston is viewed with disgust by Steiner, Devlin, and their fellow commandos. After Steiner, Neumannn, and Devlin escape, Preston is lynched inside the village&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church by a mentally-ill resident of Studley Constable.

==Publication details==
* 1975, US, Bantam Books 
*1975, US, Holt, Rinehart and Winston 

==Reception==
This book rapidly became a bestseller. As of 2010, it has sold more than 50 million copies.

==Adaptation==
The film rights were purchased and an adaptation was quickly prepared. In 1976, a British film of the same name was released, the last film directed by John Sturges. It starred Michael Caine, Donald Sutherland, Jenny Agutter, and Robert Duvall. Its success also stimulated more book sales. 

==Sequel==
Higgins wrote a sequel called &quot;The Eagle Has Flown&quot;, which was published in 1991. It was also set during World War II.

Higgins featured his character of Liam Devlin in several later thrillers. He is older and acts as a mentor to Sean Dillon and Martin Brosnan. In Higgins&#x27; novel &quot;Confessional&quot; (1985), Devlin allies with MI6 to prevent a rogue KGB assassin from murdering Pope John Paul II.

<text>The E (Eastern) postcode area, also known as the London E postcode area, is the part of the London post town covering much of east London, England. It borders the N postcode area to the west, both north of the tidal Thames. Since closure of the East London mail centre, its mail is sorted at Romford Mail Centre together with IG and RM postcode areas.

==Postal administration==
The current E postcode area was originally formed in 1866 as a merger of the E and NE areas, which had been created in 1858. In 1917, the postal districts were numbered alphabetically by their most important parish, chapelry, topographical or built environment feature. As of 2004, the district names do not form part of the postal address. High demand caused sector 9 of the E1 postcode district to be split and recoded in 1999 to create an E1W postcode district around Wapping, but the rest of the district did not gain an additional character. When districts are used for purposes other than the sorting of mail, such as use as a geographic reference and on street signs, E1 and E1W continue to be commonly classed as one &#x27;district&#x27;. The E postcode area contains two non-geographic postcode districts for high-volume business users, E77 and E98.

The Eastern District Office is on Whitechapel Road and was the eastern terminus for the former London Post Office Railway, which has been mothballed since 2003. The railway ran to the Paddington Head District Sorting Office.

The E20 postcode has been used fictionally in television soap-opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; since 1985. It has been a real postcode since 2011 carved from and only bordered by the E15 postcode, its buildings marketed as and often self-identifying as Olympic Park and Queen Elizabeth Park. It includes landmark sports venues built for the 2012 Summer Olympics.

The E17 postcode district is one of four to have a population above 100,000.

==Boundaries==
The E postcode district is bounded by the River Thames to the south. Postcode districts E6, E14 and E16 also have river frontages in the south. The River Roding and the North Circular Road form part of the boundary in the east. The postcode area is roughly the combined area of the London Boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Newham and Waltham Forest. Also, the eastern part of the London Borough of Hackney, the western sections of the London Boroughs of Redbridge (E11, E12, E18) and Barking and Dagenham (E6) and a small part of the Epping Forest District (E4), are within the postcode area.

== In popular culture ==
* The 1990s pop band East 17, formed in Walthamstow, whose postcode district is E17.
* BBC soap &quot;EastEnders&quot; uses E20 (which did not actually exist until 2011) as the postcode district for the borough of Walford.
* The track &quot;Bow E3&quot; by grime musician Wiley refers to the E3 postcode, which is centred on the area of Bow where Wiley grew up.
* The album E3 AF by Dizzee Rascal also refers to the E3 postcode and the Bow area, where he grew up.

==Map==

The postcode area excludes parts of East London like the following:
* Central areas covered by central London EC postcodes.
* Hoxton in Shoreditch is part of the N postcode area but is usually seen as being part of the East End.
* The eastern suburbs built after the introduction of the E postcode area are now mainly in the IG and RM postal areas.

<text>George Alan Ashman (30 May 1928 – 30 November 2002) was an English association footballer, best remembered for some notable managerial successes.

==Playing career==
Born in Rotherham, West Riding of Yorkshire, Ashman had an undistinguished amateur playing career with Sheffield United and Nottingham Forest during the ad hoc competitions of the Second World War.

In 1951, he signed for Carlisle United for whom he made 214 appearances, scoring 98 goals. In 1958, suffering from cartilage damage, he retired from playing to manage the poultry farm of one of the club&#x27;s directors. As a recreation, he managed amateur team Penrith and when Third Division Carlisle found themselves in need of a manager in February 1963, the club offered Ashman the job. During his playing career he played cricket for Cumberland in the 1956 Minor Counties Championship.

In 2009 Ashman was named at 18th in a list of Carlisle United&#x27;s top 100 players, compiled by local newspaper the &quot;News and Star&quot;.

==Management career==
Ashman was too late to prevent that season&#x27;s relegation but the following season saw a bounce back, and the season after that, the Third Division championship. Leading Division Two for much of the 1965–66 season, the club was disappointed to miss out on promotion by finishing third.

Ashman&#x27;s exploits had not gone unnoticed and, in 1967, he joined West Bromwich Albion, leading them in a series of exciting cup runs, crowned by victory in the 1968 FA Cup. His new club was, however, impatient for further trophies and he was dismissed in 1971, hearing of the news from a waiter while on holiday in Greece.

Somewhat ironically, he went on to manage Olympiakos before returning to Carlisle in August 1972, leading the club to the First Division and a brief spell at the top of the entire English league.

The heights were short-lived and Ashman left the club to manage Workington from 1975 to 1977 and Walsall before settling for junior coaching and scouting roles at Derby County, Hereford United and Swallows of Walsall. He died in 2002 in Walsall. A minute&#x27;s silence was held in his honour prior to West Bromwich Albion&#x27;s home match against Sunderland.

<doc id="672713" wikidata="Q5895339" url="?curid=672713" title="2004 Hong Kong legislative election">
<text>The 2004 Hong Kong Legislative Council election was held on 12 September 2004 for members of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong (LegCo). The election returned 30 members from directly elected geographical constituencies and 30 members from functional constituencies, of which 11 were unopposed.

An unprecedented number of 3.2 million people registered to vote in the election. The turnout rate was an unprecedented 55.6% with 1,784,406 voters casting ballots, beating the previous record set in 1998 by 200,000 votes. While pro-democratic opposition candidates gained new seats in the legislature, their gains fell short of their expectations.

In the geographical constituencies, candidates from the pro-democratic camp secured 60 percent of the seats in the geographical sectors of the election, taking 18 seats (up from 17) in this category, and 62 percent of the popular vote. On the other hand, the pro-Beijing and pro-business candidates made greater gains, winning 12 directly elected seats (up from 7). In the functional constituencies which the pro-democratic camp sought to abolish, the camp made more gains (from 5 to 7 seats).

Overall, the democrats took 25 seats and the pro-government camp 35 seats. Bills initiated by the government can still be passed on pro-government support alone, but bills originated by members cannot be passed without democratic support, since these bills require absolute majorities in each sector (geographical and functional) of the legislature. Constitutional amendments require a two-thirds vote and thereby also require support from the democratic camp.

Despite the increase in the number of seats returned by geographical constituencies and the record turnout, the Democratic Party lost the status of being the largest political party in the Legislative Council to the pro-government Democratic Alliance for Betterment of Hong Kong, DAB, who secured 12 seats if including the two members who ran under the banner of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, and pro-business Liberal Party who secured 10 seats, thereby becoming only the third-largest party. Some attributed the poor performance of the pro-democratic camp to tactical miscalculation in vote allocation. This was not helped by some of the democratic parties&#x27; personal scandals.

The pro-Beijing and pro-business parties succeeded in retaining the majority in the legislature. However, pro-democracy candidates have maintained the threshold to block changes, if necessary, to the Basic Law of Hong Kong, since a two-thirds vote is required for amendment. The current Legislative Council also saw the entry of more radical members of the democratic camp.

==Change in composition==
According to the Annex II of the Basic Law of Hong Kong, the 6-seat Election Committee constituency indirectly elected by the 800-member Election Committee would be abolished, while the directly elected geographical constituency seats would increase from 24 to 30, same number of the indirectly elected functional constituencies. As a result, Hong Kong Island and Kowloon East was added one extra seat each, from five to six and four to five respectively, and the New Territories West and New Territories East was added two extra seats each, from six to eight and five to seven respectively, while the number of seats in Kowloon West remained four.

==Background==
The election came amidst the deteriorating governance and intense debates over constitutional reforms in Hong Kong. The Tung Chee-hwa administration had been embattling with economic recession brought by the 1997 financial crisis and the more prominent SARS outbreak in 2003. Nevertheless, the Tung administration pushed forward the controversial Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23 legislation which outlawed &quot;treason&quot; and &quot;subversive activities&quot; and raised concerns on its potential threats against Hong Kong people&#x27;s civil liberties. A group of barristers formed the Basic Law Article 23 Concern Group and rallied against the national security legislation. Over 500,000 people to protested on 1 July 2003, the sixth anniversary of the establishment of the HKSAR, against the legislation, the largest demonstration since the handover. The Article 23 legislation further crippled the Tung administration as the government saw its popularity dropped to a new low. The Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB), the largest pro-Beijing party saw its largest defeat in the District Council elections in November 2003, which alarmed the Beijing and the Hong Kong government.

The Annex I and Annex II of the Basic Law state that the method for selecting the Chief Executive and for forming the Legislative Council could be amended after 2007. The pro-democracy camp argued that the third term of Chief Executive and fourth term of Legislative Council should be elected on the basis of universal suffrage in 2007 and 2008 as stipulated in the Article 45 and 68 of the Basic Law respectively. In 2004, the Article 23 Concern Group transformed into the Article 45 Concern Group calling for the early implementation of the universal suffrage. Facing the pro-democracy pressure for full democratisation, in April 2004, the National People&#x27;s Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) ruled out the 2007/08 universal suffrage.

==Retiring incumbents==
With the cancellation of the Election Committee constituency, there were total of twelve incumbents chose not to run for re-election. Ip Kwok-him lost his seat in the Central and Western District Council therefore was not qualified for running in the District Council functional constituency.

|} Note: For the joint list of pro-democrats in Hong Kong Island, Kowloon East and New Territories East, the votes are divided equally to each candidate.

===Overview===
The election was largely seen as a contest between the pro-democracy coalition and the pro-business and pro-Beijing coalitions. There were 162 candidates for 60 seats in the LegCo. Before the election, the pro-democratic camp was widely expected to gain the most votes and increase its representation from 22 seats in the LegCo. Some members of the pro-democratic camp aimed at securing an absolute majority of the seats in the legislature so that they would have the power to veto all government proposals.

The democratic camp called for direct elections for the Chief Executive of Hong Kong in 2007 and for LegCo in 2008, as well as rapid political reform. In contrast, the pro-Beijing and pro-business candidates placed more emphasis on economic growth and social stability. Most of the political parties are now setting 2012 as the ideal time for electoral reform.

While the democratic camp hoped to play up the issue of universal suffrage as a prominent issue in the election, the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress ruled out universal suffrage for the Chief Executive election in 2007 and for LegCo elections in 2008 in April 2004 before the election. Despite this, the pro-democratic camp insisted on promoting their agenda, which seemed to backfire when the campaign lost its original momentum. This was not helped by various sex and financial scandals of a few pro-democracy candidates. There were some allegations by the pro-democracy camp of Mainland Chinese influence behind this.

Some of the developments include:
* Some reports in phone-in radio programmes that some officials in the Mainland requested businessmen to take photographs of their completed ballots with their mobile phones to prove that they have voted for pro-Beijing candidates. In response, the government removed curtains from polling booths to deter such activities.
* The entry into the election race of popular radio show host Albert Cheng, who had accused Beijing of pressuring him to leave his radio program.
* The arrest and sentence (by re-education through labour) of the Democratic Party candidate Alex Ho in Guangdong province of China for (allegedly) being caught and pictured in a hotel bedroom having relations with a prostitute. Although there were some initial predictions that Ho&#x27;s arrest would help the Democratic Party by highlighting deficiencies in the PRC&#x27;s judicial system, it is generally agreed that his arrest greatly hurt the party among women voter support in Hong Kong.
* The involvement of Democratic Party James To and The Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions Chan Yuen-han in scandals relating to the use of public funds for the benefit of their respective political groups.
* Human Rights Watch issued a report a few days before the election, accusing the PRC government of creating a &quot;climate of fear&quot; to influence the election. In response, the Hong Kong government claimed that the report was distorted.
* The assault of a candidate of the Democratic Party in the New Territories East, Wong Sing-chi. The suspect was arrested and reportedly found to be mentally ill.
* The election of radical activist &quot;Long Hair&quot; Leung Kwok-hung, who ran as an independent but who is expected to side with pro-democracy representatives despite his revolutionary leanings.

===Irregularities===
There were a few reports of irregularities. Some polling stations ran out of ballot boxes, causing long delays in voting. To fit more ballots into the ballot boxes, some election workers forcefully stuffed ballots into the box using objects such as barbecue forks and metal rulers. Some stations also used random cardboard boxes without official seals. Some ballot boxes were opened before the close of polling.

The polling station operating manual had mistakes in it, so some candidate representatives were kicked out after the closing of the poll and were prevented from witnessing the counting, as required by law.

Some candidates have tried to challenge the election results, but have remained unsuccessful thus far.

A report on the election process was published shortly after the election. Another report was commissioned by the government to suggest future improvements.

<text>Understatement is an expression of lesser strength than what the speaker or writer actually means or than what is normally expected. It is the opposite of embellishment or exaggeration, and is used for emphasis, irony, hedging, or humor. A particular form of understatement using negative syntax is called litotes. This is not to be confused with euphemism, where a polite phrase is used in place of a harsher or more offensive expression.

Understatement may also be called underexaggeration to denote lesser enthusiasm. Understatement also merges the comic with the ironic, as in Mark Twain’s comment, “The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.”

==Use by the English==

Understatement often leads to litotes, rhetorical constructs in which understatement is used to emphasize a point. It is a staple of humour in English-speaking cultures. For example, in &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s The Meaning of Life&quot;, an Army officer has just lost his leg. When asked how he feels, he looks down at his bloody stump and responds, &quot;Stings a bit.&quot;

The well-known Victorian critique of Cleopatra&#x27;s behaviour as exemplified in Sarah Bernhardt&#x27;s performance in &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;: &quot;How different, how very different, from the home life of our own dear Queen!&quot;.

In April 1951, during the Battle of the Imjin River of the Korean War, 650 British fighting mensoldiers and officers from the 1st Battalion, the Gloucestershire Regimentwere deployed on the most important crossing on the river to block the traditional invasion route to Seoul. The Chinese had sent an entire division10,000 mento smash the isolated Glosters aside in a major offensive to take the whole Korean peninsula, and the small force was gradually surrounded and overwhelmed. After two days&#x27; fighting, an American, Major General Robert H Soule, asked the British brigadier, Thomas Brodie: &quot;How are the Glosters doing?&quot; The brigadier, schooled in Britain and thus British humour, replied: &quot;A bit sticky, things are pretty sticky down there.&quot; To American ears, this did not sound desperate, and so he ordered them to stand fast. Only 40 Glosters managed to escape.

During the Kuala-Lumpur-to-Perth leg of British Airways Flight 9 on 24 June 1982, volcanic ash caused all four engines of the Boeing 747 aircraft to fail. Although pressed for time as the aircraft rapidly lost altitude, Captain Eric Moody still managed to make an announcement to the passengers: &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. We have a small problem. All four engines have stopped. We are doing our damnedest to get them going again. I trust you are not in too much distress.&quot;

<text>In mathematics, the matrix exponential is a matrix function on square matrices analogous to the ordinary exponential function. It is used to solve systems of linear differential equations. In the theory of Lie groups, the matrix exponential gives the exponential map between a matrix Lie algebra and the corresponding Lie group.

Let be an real or complex matrix. The exponential of , denoted by or , is the matrix given by the power series

formula_1

where formula_2 is defined to be the identity matrix formula_3 with the same dimensions as formula_4, and . The series always converges, so the exponential of is well-defined.

Equivalently,
formula_5

for integer-valued , where is the identity matrix. 

Equivalently, given by the solution to the differential equation

formula_6

When is an diagonal matrix then will be an diagonal matrix with each diagonal element equal to the ordinary exponential applied to the corresponding diagonal element of .

== Properties ==
=== Elementary properties ===
Let and be complex matrices and let and be arbitrary complex numbers. We denote the identity matrix by and the zero matrix by 0. The matrix exponential satisfies the following properties.

We begin with the properties that are immediate consequences of the definition as a power series:
* , where denotes the transpose of .
* , where denotes the conjugate transpose of .
* If is invertible then 

The next key result is this one:
* If formula_7 then formula_8.

The proof of this identity is the same as the standard power-series argument for the corresponding identity for the exponential of real numbers. That is to say, &quot;as long as formula_4 and formula_10 commute&quot;, it makes no difference to the argument whether formula_4 and formula_10 are numbers or matrices. It is important to note that this identity typically does not hold if formula_4 and formula_10 do not commute (see Golden-Thompson inequality below).

Consequences of the preceding identity are the following:
* 

Using the above results, we can easily verify the following claims. If is symmetric then is also symmetric, and if is skew-symmetric then is orthogonal. If is Hermitian then is also Hermitian, and if is skew-Hermitian then is unitary.

Finally, a Laplace transform of matrix exponentials amounts to the resolvent,
formula_15
for all sufficiently large positive values of .

=== Linear differential equation systems ===

One of the reasons for the importance of the matrix exponential is that it can be used to solve systems of linear ordinary differential equations. The solution of
formula_16
where is a constant matrix and &quot;y&quot; is a column vector, is given by
formula_17

The matrix exponential can also be used to solve the inhomogeneous equation
formula_18
See the section on applications below for examples.

There is no closed-form solution for differential equations of the form
formula_19
where is not constant, but the Magnus series gives the solution as an infinite sum.

=== The determinant of the matrix exponential ===
By Jacobi&#x27;s formula, for any complex square matrix the following trace identity holds:
In addition to providing a computational tool, this formula demonstrates that a matrix exponential is always an invertible matrix. This follows from the fact that the right hand side of the above equation is always non-zero, and so , which implies that must be invertible.

In the real-valued case, the formula also exhibits the map
formula_20
to not be surjective, in contrast to the complex case mentioned earlier. This follows from the fact that, for real-valued matrices, the right-hand side of the formula is always positive, while there exist invertible matrices with a negative determinant.

=== Real symmetric matrices ===

The matrix exponential of a real symmetric matrix is positive definite. Let formula_21 be an real symmetric matrix and formula_22 a column vector. Using the elementary properties of the matrix exponential and of symmetric matrices, we have:

formula_23

Since formula_24 is invertible, the equality only holds for formula_25, and we have formula_26 for all non-zero formula_27. Hence formula_28 is positive definite.

== The exponential of sums ==

For any real numbers (scalars) and we know that the exponential function satisfies . The same is true for commuting matrices. If matrices and commute (meaning that ), then,
formula_29

However, for matrices that do not commute the above equality does not necessarily hold.

=== The Lie product formula ===
Even if and do not commute, the exponential can be computed by the Lie product formula
formula_30

Using a large finite to approximate the above is basis of the Suzuki-Trotter expansion, often used in numerical time evolution.

=== The Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula ===
In the other direction, if and are sufficiently small (but not necessarily commuting) matrices, we have
formula_31
where may be computed as a series in commutators of and by means of the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula:
formula_32
where the remaining terms are all iterated commutators involving and . If and commute, then all the commutators are zero and we have simply .

== Inequalities for exponentials of Hermitian matrices ==

For Hermitian matrices there is a notable theorem related to the trace of matrix exponentials.

If and are Hermitian matrices, then
formula_33

There is no requirement of commutativity. There are counterexamples to show that the Golden–Thompson inequality cannot be extended to three matrices – and, in any event, is not guaranteed to be real for Hermitian , , . However, Lieb proved that it can be generalized to three matrices if we modify the expression as follows
formula_34

== The exponential map ==
The exponential of a matrix is always an invertible matrix. The inverse matrix of is given by . This is analogous to the fact that the exponential of a complex number is always nonzero. The matrix exponential then gives us a map
formula_35
from the space of all &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrices to the general linear group of degree , i.e. the group of all &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; invertible matrices. In fact, this map is surjective which means that every invertible matrix can be written as the exponential of some other matrix (for this, it is essential to consider the field C of complex numbers and not R).

For any two matrices and ,
formula_36

where denotes an arbitrary matrix norm. It follows that the exponential map is continuous and Lipschitz continuous on compact subsets of .

The map
formula_37
defines a smooth curve in the general linear group which passes through the identity element at .

In fact, this gives a one-parameter subgroup of the general linear group since
formula_38

The derivative of this curve (or tangent vector) at a point &quot;t&quot; is given by

The derivative at is just the matrix &quot;X&quot;, which is to say that &quot;X&quot; generates this one-parameter subgroup.

More generally, for a generic -dependent exponent, ,
Taking the above expression outside the integral sign and expanding the integrand with the help of the Hadamard lemma one can obtain the following useful expression for the derivative of the matrix exponent,
formula_39

The coefficients in the expression above are different from what appears in the exponential. For a closed form, see derivative of the exponential map.

=== Directional derivatives when restricted to Hermitian matrices ===

Let formula_4 be a formula_41 Hermitian matrix with distinct eigenvalues. Let formula_42 be its eigen-decomposition where formula_43 is a unitary matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of formula_4, formula_45 is its conjugate transpose, and formula_46 the vector of corresponding eigenvalues. Then, for any formula_41 Hermitian matrix formula_48, the directional derivative of formula_49 at formula_4 in the direction formula_48 is
formula_52
where formula_53, the operator formula_54 denotes the Hadamard product, and, for all formula_55, the matrix formula_56 is defined as
formula_57
In addition, for any formula_41 Hermitian matrix formula_59, the second directional derivative in directions formula_59 and formula_48 is
formula_62
where the matrix-valued function formula_63 is defined, for all formula_55, as
formula_65
with
formula_66

== Computing the matrix exponential ==

Finding reliable and accurate methods to compute the matrix exponential is difficult, and this is still a topic of considerable current research in mathematics and numerical analysis. Matlab, GNU Octave, R, and SciPy all use the Padé approximant. In this section, we discuss methods that are applicable in principle to any matrix, and which can be carried out explicitly for small matrices. Subsequent sections describe methods suitable for numerical evaluation on large matrices.

=== Diagonalizable case ===

If a matrix is diagonal:
formula_67
then its exponential can be obtained by exponentiating each entry on the main diagonal:
formula_68

This result also allows one to exponentiate diagonalizable matrices. If

then

which is especially easy to compute when is diagonal.

Application of Sylvester&#x27;s formula yields the same result. (To see this, note that addition and multiplication, hence also exponentiation, of diagonal matrices is equivalent to element-wise addition and multiplication, and hence exponentiation; in particular, the &quot;one-dimensional&quot; exponentiation is felt element-wise for the diagonal case.)

===Example : Diagonalizable===
For example, the matrix
formula_69
can be diagonalized as
formula_70

Thus,
formula_71

=== Nilpotent case ===
A matrix is nilpotent if for some integer &quot;q&quot;. In this case, the matrix exponential can be computed directly from the series expansion, as the series terminates after a finite number of terms:

formula_72

Since the series has a finite number of steps, it is a matrix polynomial, which can be computed efficiently.

=== General case ===
==== Using the Jordan–Chevalley decomposition ====
By the Jordan–Chevalley decomposition, any formula_41 matrix &quot;X&quot; with complex entries can be expressed as
formula_74
where
* &quot;A&quot; is diagonalizable
* &quot;N&quot; is nilpotent
* &quot;A&quot; commutes with &quot;N&quot;

This means that we can compute the exponential of &quot;X&quot; by reducing to the previous two cases:
formula_75

Note that we need the commutativity of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;N&quot; for the last step to work.

==== Using the Jordan canonical form ====
A closely related method is, if the field is algebraically closed, to work with the Jordan form of . Suppose that where is the Jordan form of . Then
formula_76

Also, since
formula_77

Therefore, we need only know how to compute the matrix exponential of a Jordan block. But each Jordan block is of the form
formula_78

where is a special nilpotent matrix. The matrix exponential of is then given by
formula_79

=== Projection case ===
If is a projection matrix (i.e. is idempotent: ), its matrix exponential is:
Deriving this by expansion of the exponential function, each power of reduces to which becomes a common factor of the sum:
formula_80

=== Rotation case ===
For a simple rotation in which the perpendicular unit vectors and specify a plane, the rotation matrix can be expressed in terms of a similar exponential function involving a generator and angle .
formula_81
formula_82

The formula for the exponential results from reducing the powers of in the series expansion and identifying the respective series coefficients of and with and respectively. The second expression here for is the same as the expression for in the article containing the derivation of the generator, .

In two dimensions, if formula_83 and formula_84, then formula_85, formula_86, and
formula_87
reduces to the standard matrix for a plane rotation.

The matrix projects a vector onto the -plane and the rotation only affects this part of the vector. An example illustrating this is a rotation of in the plane spanned by and ,

formula_88
formula_89

Let , so and its products with and are zero. This will allow us to evaluate powers of .

formula_90

== Evaluation by Laurent series ==
By virtue of the Cayley–Hamilton theorem the matrix exponential is expressible as a polynomial of order −1.

If and are nonzero polynomials in one variable, such that , and if the meromorphic function
formula_91
is entire, then
formula_92
To prove this, multiply the first of the two above equalities by and replace by .

Such a polynomial can be found as follows−see Sylvester&#x27;s formula. Letting be a root of , is solved from the product of by the principal part of the Laurent series of at : It is proportional to the relevant Frobenius covariant. Then the sum &quot;St&quot; of the &quot;Qa,t&quot;, where runs over all the roots of , can be taken as a particular . All the other &quot;Qt&quot; will be obtained by adding a multiple of to . In particular, , the Lagrange-Sylvester polynomial, is the only whose degree is less than that of .

Example: Consider the case of an arbitrary matrix,
formula_93

The exponential matrix , by virtue of the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, must be of the form
formula_94

(For any complex number and any C-algebra , we denote again by the product of by the unit of .)

Let and be the roots of the characteristic polynomial of ,
formula_95

Then we have
formula_96
hence
formula_97

if ; while, if ,
formula_98

so that
formula_99

Defining
formula_100

we have
formula_101

where is 0 if , and if .

Thus,
Thus, as indicated above, the matrix having decomposed into the sum of two mutually commuting pieces, the traceful piece and the traceless piece,
formula_102

the matrix exponential reduces to a plain product of the exponentials of the two respective pieces. This is a formula often used in physics, as it amounts to the analog of Euler&#x27;s formula for Pauli spin matrices, that is rotations of the doublet representation of the group SU(2).

The polynomial can also be given the following &quot;interpolation&quot; characterization. Define , and . Then is the unique degree polynomial which satisfies whenever is less than the multiplicity of as a root of . We assume, as we obviously can, that is the minimal polynomial of . We further assume that is a diagonalizable matrix. In particular, the roots of are simple, and the &quot;interpolation&quot; characterization indicates that is given by the Lagrange interpolation formula, so it is the Lagrange−Sylvester polynomial.

At the other extreme, if , then
formula_103

The simplest case not covered by the above observations is when formula_104 with , which yields
formula_105

== Evaluation by implementation of Sylvester&#x27;s formula ==
A practical, expedited computation of the above reduces to the following rapid steps. Recall from above that an matrix amounts to a linear combination of the first −1 powers of by the Cayley–Hamilton theorem. For diagonalizable matrices, as illustrated above, e.g. in the case, Sylvester&#x27;s formula yields , where the s are the Frobenius covariants of .

It is easiest, however, to simply solve for these s directly, by evaluating this expression and its first derivative at , in terms of and , to find the same answer as above.

But this simple procedure also works for defective matrices, in a generalization due to Buchheim. This is illustrated here for a example of a matrix which is &quot;not diagonalizable&quot;, and the s are not projection matrices.

Consider
formula_106
with eigenvalues and , each with a multiplicity of two.

Consider the exponential of each eigenvalue multiplied by , . Multiply each exponentiated eigenvalue by the corresponding undetermined coefficient matrix . If the eigenvalues have an algebraic multiplicity greater than 1, then repeat the process, but now multiplying by an extra factor of for each repetition, to ensure linear independence.

(If one eigenvalue had a multiplicity of three, then there would be the three terms: formula_107. By contrast, when all eigenvalues are distinct, the s are just the Frobenius covariants, and solving for them as below just amounts to the inversion of the Vandermonde matrix of these 4 eigenvalues.)

Sum all such terms, here four such,
formula_108

To solve for all of the unknown matrices in terms of the first three powers of and the identity, one needs four equations, the above one providing one such at = 0. Further, differentiate it with respect to ,
formula_109

and again,
formula_110

and once more,
formula_111

(In the general case, −1 derivatives need be taken.)

Setting = 0 in these four equations, the four coefficient matrices s may now be solved for,
formula_112

to yield
formula_113

Substituting with the value for yields the coefficient matrices
formula_114

so the final answer is
formula_115

The procedure is much shorter than Putzer&#x27;s algorithm sometimes utilized in such cases.

== Illustrations ==

Suppose that we want to compute the exponential of
formula_116

Its Jordan form is
formula_117
where the matrix &quot;P&quot; is given by
formula_118

Let us first calculate exp(&quot;J&quot;). We have
formula_119

The exponential of a matrix is just the exponential of the one entry of the matrix, so . The exponential of &quot;J&quot;2(16) can be calculated by the formula mentioned above; this yields

formula_120

Therefore, the exponential of the original matrix is
formula_121

== Applications ==

=== Linear differential equations ===

The matrix exponential has applications to systems of linear differential equations. (See also matrix differential equation.) Recall from earlier in this article that a &quot;homogeneous&quot; differential equation of the form
formula_122
has solution .

If we consider the vector
formula_123
we can express a system of &quot;inhomogeneous&quot; coupled linear differential equations as
formula_124
Making an ansatz to use an integrating factor of and multiplying throughout, yields
formula_125

The second step is possible due to the fact that, if , then . So, calculating leads to the solution to the system, by simply integrating the third step with respect to .

A solution to this can be obtained by integrating and multiplying by formula_126 to eliminate the exponent in the LHS. Notice that while formula_126 is a matrix, given that it is a matrix exponential, we can say that formula_128. In other words, formula_129.

==== Example (homogeneous) ====
Consider the system
formula_130

The associated defective matrix is
formula_131

The matrix exponential is
formula_132

so that the general solution of the homogeneous system is
formula_133

amounting to
formula_134

==== Example (inhomogeneous) ====
Consider now the inhomogeneous system
formula_135

We again have
formula_136

and
formula_137

From before, we already have the general solution to the homogeneous equation. Since the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions give the general solution to the inhomogeneous problem, we now only need find the particular solution.

We have, by above,
formula_138
which could be further simplified to get the requisite particular solution determined through variation of parameters.
Note c = y&quot;p&quot;(0). For more rigor, see the following generalization.

=== Inhomogeneous case generalization: variation of parameters ===
For the inhomogeneous case, we can use integrating factors (a method akin to variation of parameters). We seek a particular solution of the form ,
formula_139

For to be a solution,
formula_140

Thus,
formula_141
where is determined by the initial conditions of the problem.

More precisely, consider the equation
formula_142

with the initial condition , where
* is an by complex matrix,
* is a continuous function from some open interval to ,
* formula_143 is a point of , and
* formula_144 is a vector of .

Left-multiplying the above displayed equality by yields
formula_145

We claim that the solution to the equation
formula_146

with the initial conditions formula_147 for is
formula_148

where the notation is as follows:
* formula_149 is a monic polynomial of degree ,
* is a continuous complex valued function defined on some open interval ,
* formula_143 is a point of ,
* formula_151 is a complex number, and

 is the coefficient of formula_152 in the polynomial denoted by formula_153 in Subsection Evaluation by Laurent series above.

To justify this claim, we transform our order scalar equation into an order one vector equation by the usual reduction to a first order system. Our vector equation takes the form
formula_154
where is the transpose companion matrix of . We solve this equation as explained above, computing the matrix exponentials by the observation made in Subsection Evaluation by implementation of Sylvester&#x27;s formula above.

In the case = 2 we get the following statement. The solution to
formula_155

is
formula_156

where the functions and are as in Subsection Evaluation by Laurent series above.

== Matrix-matrix exponentials ==
The matrix exponential of another matrix (matrix-matrix exponential), is defined as
formula_157
formula_158
for any normal and non-singular matrix , and any complex matrix .

For matrix-matrix exponentials, there is a distinction between the left exponential and the right exponential , because the multiplication operator for matrix-to-matrix is not commutative. Moreover,
* If is normal and non-singular, then and have the same set of eigenvalues.
* If is normal and non-singular, is normal, and , then .
* If is normal and non-singular, and , , commute with each other, then and .

<text>Mikhael is a 2019 Indian Malayalam-language action thriller film directed by Haneef Adeni and produced by Anto Joseph. It stars Nivin Pauly in the titular role, alongside Unni Mukundan, Manjima Mohan, Siddique, JD Chakravarthy, Suraj Venjaramoodu, K.P.A.C Lalitha, Ashokan, Jayaprakash, Sudev Nair, Kalabhavan Shajohn, Sijoy Varghese, Babu Antony and Baiju Santhosh. The music was composed by Gopi Sundar, while the cinematography and editing were handled by Vishnu Panicker and Mahesh Narayanan.

&quot;Mikhael&quot; was released on 18 January 2019. The film received mixed-to-negative reviews from critics and was a box-office disaster. A spin-off titled &quot;Marco&quot; was released on 20 December 2024, which became a massive commercial success.

==Plot==
George D&#x27;Peter or &quot;Adattu George&quot;, an influential gold smuggler in Kerala from the famous Adattu family and his driver are killed under mysterious circumstances. ACP Muhammed Easa and CI Isaac John begin the investigation and discover that the murders were carried out with a surgical blade, deduce that a doctor committed them and start investigating medical stores. At the same time, George&#x27;s cold-blooded younger brother, Marco D&#x27;Peter who is the younger brother of the Adattu family, meets George&#x27;s partners, William Davis, and his elder son, Abraham Davis, to ask whether it was their work. When Abraham speaks in a disgusting manner, an agitated Marco shoots him to death. During his funeral, Easa asks William and his younger son, Francy Davis, about Abraham&#x27;s murder, but they do not reveal anything. 

One night, a mysterious person shoots Patrick, Davis&#x27;s secretary. Easa and Isaac take him to Star Hospital, where he is murdered despite being protected with maximum security. This solidifies the theories of Easa and Isaac that the killer is a doctor and the gangs start believing that someone is after them. Isaac becomes suspicious of Easa since he revealed that he had an informant, but did not reveal anything about him. Isaac investigates on his own, discovering that Dr. Mikhael John, a young surgeon of &quot;Star Hospital&quot; is the killer and Easa&#x27;s informant. Issac also finds that Easa is helping Mikhael since they have contacted each other several times. Issac forces Easa to reveal everything to prevent Michael&#x27;s arrest, where Easa reveals Michael&#x27;s past.

Past: A ten-year-old Michael persuades his father John, a martial arts trainer, to let him drive his car, which results in John&#x27;s death. Michael&#x27;s mother, Ancy, blames him for his father&#x27;s death, resulting in Michael separating from Ancy. Meanwhile, George&#x27;s son, Gerald D&#x27;Peter, challenged Jenny, Michael&#x27;s younger sister, to a kung-fu fight in front of the school. Jenny defeats him, causing his friends and other students to tease him for losing to a girl. Depressed over the matter, Gerald commits suicide by jumping from the school terrace. George visits Jenny and asks her to jump from the school terrace in the same way Gerald had jumped or he will kill her entire family. 

George continuously disturbs and harasses Jenny, who decides to jump off the school terrace. Before Jenny jumps off the school terrace, Michael saves her. After learning about the harassment, Michael files a complaint to the police, but the SI warns him as they are allied with George. Ancy asks him to visit them on Christmas, but Michael refuses. George later kills Ancy in a car accident, causing Michael to burn his Audi Q7 car. George and his henchmen capture Michael and thrash him brutally, leaving him on a railroad track to his death. Michael manages to escape and eventually catches up to George and his driver, killing them.

Present: Marco Jr. learns about Michael and Jenny and vows to finish them. Easa also reveals that he ordered Michael to kill Patrick since he was a common connection between the gangs and killing him will provoke a gang war. Meanwhile, William and Francy kidnap Jenny as they learnt about Michael&#x27;s involvement in Patrick&#x27;s death, but he manages to save Jenny. William and Francy are arrested by Easa, who also arrests Marco for killing Abraham. However, Marco gets released on bail, where he kidnaps Jenny and takes her to the helipad of a skyscraper and challenges Michael to a hand-to-hand combat. Michael arrives at the helipad and fights with Marco. Using a hidden surgical blade in his pocket, Michael severely injures Marco and signs him up for organ donation, finally walking away with Jenny.

==Cast==

==Spin-off==

A standalone spin-off to the film titled &quot;Marco&quot; was released on 20 December 2024, with Unni Mukundan and Siddique reprising their roles from this film. &quot; Marco&quot; features Marco and George, the negative characters of &quot;Mikhael&quot; in the lead roles.

== Reception ==
===Critical response===

Sajin Shrijith of &quot;Cinema Express&quot; gave 4/5 stars and termed &quot;Mikhael&quot; as &quot;tightly-paced, testosterone-fueled entertainment.&quot; Renukha Padmanabhan of &quot;The Week&quot; gave 3/5 stars and wrote &quot;The narrative takes recourse to frequent flashbacks, but the director makes sure that the audience do not lose track of the happenings as he switches between the past and the present. Gopi Sundar&#x27;s background score fits well into the proceedings; however, there isn&#x27;t much novelty and you are left with a sense of deja vu while listening to the score.&quot;

Deepa Soman of &quot;The Times of India&quot; gave 2.5/5 stars and wrote &quot;By the first half itself, the reasons for the events yet to unfold are almost clear and those waiting to be revealed post intermission hardly evoke any thrill as they arrive. The long second half is all about waiting to see what all the hero gets to do to the villains, to punish them.&quot; &quot;Behindwoods&quot; gave 2.5/5 stars and wrote &quot;&quot;Mikhael&quot; is the kind of film which will entertain you if you do not expect everything to be logical. To enjoy the movie to the fullest you should let the film go in whichever direction it feels like going, and not think too much about anything.&quot;

Sowmya Rajendran from &quot;The News Minute&quot; wrote that &quot;Even if you watch the film knowing what to expect of Haneef Adeni, &#x27;Mikhael&#x27; is disappointing.&quot; Manoj Kumar of &quot;The Indian Express&quot; gave 0.5/5 stars and wrote &quot;Adeni could have named this film &quot;The Great Brother&quot;, instead of &quot;Mikhael&quot;&quot; and also termed the film as a &quot;migraine-inducing incoherent mess, which kills our desire to be entertained.&quot; Anna M. M. Vetticad of &quot;Firstpost&quot; rated the film 0.75 in a scale of 5 and wrote that &quot;Nivin Pauly struggles through a pretentious, pompous affair ... the irritating music and pseudo-philosophical mumbo jumbo overshadow both the storyline and the usually reliable Nivin Pauly&#x27;s natural charm&quot;.

Navamy Sudheesh of &quot;The Hindu&quot; called the film an average action fare, wrote that &quot;while the film is engaging at some levels, it lacks that raw energy and intensity of a thorough thriller.&quot; Litty Simon of &quot;Malayala Manorama&quot; wrote &quot;The slow-paced thriller won&#x27;t really blow your mind, but it comes with enough masala for a Nivin Pauly movie.&quot; Calling the film &quot;loud&quot; and &quot;confused&quot;, Neelima Menon from &quot;Huffington Post&quot; wrote that Nivin Pauly &quot;is a thorough misfit&quot; in the film. She was also heavily critical about the film&#x27;s music.

Upon release, the makers of the film faced criticism from public and media outlets for allegedly attempting to suppress negative reviews on social media. Reports indicated that they requested Facebook to remove such posts, citing copyright issues. This effort reportedly also resulted in Facebook blocking two film-related groups.
