<text>SUNY Schenectady is a public community college in Schenectady, New York. It is part of the State University of New York (SUNY) system. It was established in 1967 in the Van Curler Hotel in Downtown Schenectady and has undergone multiple expansions through the following decades.

== History ==
The Schenectady County Board of Representatives formed SUNY Schenectady County Community College on January 26, 1967 and then purchased the former Van Curler hotel which required renovations so that classes could commence in the building in 1969. The Van Curler would be renamed Elston Hall after Charles W. Elston, the long-standing, original board member and eight-year chairperson for the Schenectady County Board of Representatives.

The first of a number of expansions occurred in 1978, with the building that houses the Begley Library, a television station, lecture halls, and a wing for the music department along with the Carl B. Taylor Community Auditorium. A 1982 expansion added the Tempo Building, housing four classrooms and continuing education. 1987 brought the Center for Science and Technology, while 1992 saw the creation of a new student center which included a cafeteria, college store, and student lounge, along with biology and geology labs and fifteen classrooms. Also completed in 1992 was the South Wing expansion which created four new culinary arts labs, expanded upon the Casola Dining Room, a childcare center, and an enclosed bridge that connected Elston Hall with the Center for Science and Technology which is located across the street from the school&#x27;s main campus.

In 2000 the Gateway Building was erected for childhood development classes and a childcare center. The next year the Stockade Building was built in order to house six computer classrooms, nine general classrooms, two lecture halls, conference rooms and offices for the Continuing Education Division and Capital District World Trade Center. Additionally, a new quad area was built in front of Elston Hall.

In 2006 a $6.3 million expansion to the Culinary Arts department began off of Elston Hall and was completed in 2007. This expansion was funded in part by fund raising activities along with $3,082,300 from the County of Schenectady.

<text>David James Stratton (born 1939) is an English-Australian film critic and historian. He has also worked as a journalist, interviewer, educator, television personality, and producer. His career as a film critic, writer, and educator in Australia spanned 57 years, until his retirement in December 2023. 

Stratton&#x27;s media career included presenting film review shows on television with Margaret Pomeranz for 28 years, writing film reviews for &quot;The Weekend Australian&quot; for 33 years, and lecturing in film history for 35 years.

==Early life and education==
Born in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, England, in 1939, David James Stratton was sent to Hampshire to see out the war years with his grandmother. An avid filmgoer, his grandmother regularly took Stratton to the local cinemas. When he was around six years old, his father returned from the war and the family moved back to Wiltshire. He attended Chafyn Grove School from 1948 to 1953 as a boarder, but never finished secondary school.

He saw his first foreign film at Bath in 1955, the Italian romantic comedy &quot;Bread, Love and Dreams&quot;. That was soon followed by Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s Japanese adventure drama classic &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;, found showing in Birmingham. At the age of 19, he founded the Melksham and District Film Society.
==Career==
Stratton arrived in Australia in 1963 under the &quot;ten pound&quot; migration scheme. He soon became involved with the local film society movement. He directed the Sydney Film Festival (a job he landed after fighting film censorship) from 1966 until 1983. At the time, he was the subject of surveillance by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), due to the festival showing Soviet films, and his late-1960s visit to Russia. This information was not made public until January 2014.

Stratton worked for SBS from 1980, acting as their film consultant and introducing the SBS Cinema Classics on Sunday evenings and Movie of the Week for 24 weeks a year. From 30 October 1986 onwards Stratton co-hosted the long-running SBS TV program &quot;The Movie Show&quot; with Margaret Pomeranz, who was also the show&#x27;s original producer. Stratton and Pomeranz (often referred to as &quot;Margaret and David&quot;) left SBS in 2004.

From 1 July 2004, they co-hosted the ABC film show, &quot;At the Movies with Margaret and David&quot;. On 16 September 2014, Stratton and Pomeranz announced that they would be retiring at the end of the 2014 series. The ABC confirmed that the series would end, with the last episode broadcast on 9 December 2014. 

Stratton wrote for US film industry magazine &quot;Variety&quot; from 1984, and has also written for &quot;TV Week&quot;. Stratton has presented a number of film reviews for Palace Nova cinemas, which are posted on their website.

He lectured in film history at the University of Sydney&#x27;s Centre for Continuing Education, from around 1988 until December 2023, during which he covered around 840 films and showed 7,506 film clips. Many of his students re-enrolled year after year. 

In 2008 he released his autobiography called &quot;I Peed on Fellini&quot;, a reference to a drunken attempt to shake director Federico Fellini&#x27;s hand while using a urinal. , he had authored six books.

==Juries and other roles==
Stratton and Pomeranz have played an important role in challenging the often heavy-handed decisions of the Australian Classification Board throughout their career. One of Stratton&#x27;s legacies is the part he played in bringing about the R18+ film classification.

Stratton has been invited to sit on many international juries at film festivals. Regarded as an expert on international cinema, particularly French cinema, he was president of FIPRESCI (International Film Critics) Juries in Cannes (twice) and Venice. He was also a member of the jury at the 32nd Berlin International Film Festival in 1982.

He has also acted as programming consultant to the London and Los Angeles Film Festivals, and has contributed regularly to the &quot;International Film Guide&quot;, compiled and published in London. Stratton and Pomeranz are patrons of the Adelaide Film Festival.

On 14 March 2015 Stratton appeared in front of a sold-out crowd in a meeting with David Lynch on the opening weekend of the exhibition &quot;David Lynch: Between Two Worlds&quot;, at the Gallery of Modern Art (GOMA) in Brisbane, Queensland. The one-hour conversation was Lynch&#x27;s first and only public appearance in Australia.

==In film and other TV==
The documentary film &quot;David Stratton: A Cinematic Life&quot;, written and directed by Sally Aitken, was released in 2017, and re-edited for television, featuring interviews with Stratton about his life and with actors, directors, producers representing Australian cinema since the 1960s. A preliminary version of the film was first released at the 2016 Adelaide Film Festival as &quot;David Stratton&#x27;s Stories of Australian Cinema&quot;, a &quot;work in progress screening... a celebration of 110 years of Australian Cinema history and its creators&quot;. The title was later screened as a three-part series on ABC Television. The series was produced by Jo-anne McGowan of production company Stranger Than Fiction.

In 1993 Stratton made an uncredited cameo appearance in Paul Cox&#x27;s &quot;Touch Me&quot;, one of the short films featured in the series &quot;Erotic Tales&quot;.

He has appeared in several ABC programs, including &quot;The Chaser&#x27;s War on Everything&quot;, &quot;Review with Myles Barlow&quot;, &quot;Good Game&quot;, &quot;Adam Hills in Gordon Street Tonight&quot;, &quot;Lawrence Leung&#x27;s Choose Your Own Adventure&quot;, &quot;Dance Academy&quot;, and &quot;The Bazura Project&quot;, often parodying himself.

== Personal life ==
Stratton is married to Susie Craig. He has a son and a daughter.

== Best films ==
Stratton has said that his favourite movie is the 1952 American musical &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;: &quot;I grew up on musicals and this is the best musical ever made&quot;.

Stratton participated in the 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critics&#x27; poll, where he listed his ten favourite films as follows: &quot;Charulata&quot;, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, &quot;The Conversation&quot;, &quot;Distant&quot;, &quot;Distant Voices, Still Lives&quot;, &quot;Kings of the Road&quot;, &quot;Lola&quot;, &quot;The Searchers&quot;, &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, and &quot;The Travelling Players&quot;.

Two articles which analysed their reviews at SBS and ABC showed that Stratton was generally a slightly harsher critic than Pomeranz. At SBS, they only both gave five stars to four films: &quot;Evil Angels&quot; (1988), &quot;Return Home&quot; (1990), &quot;The Piano&quot; (1993), The Thin Red Line (1999) and &quot;Lantana&quot; (2001). At the ABC, they only both gave five stars to six films: &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; (2005), &quot;Good Night, and Good Luck&quot; (2005), &quot;No Country For Old Men&quot; (2007), &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; (2009), &quot;A Separation&quot; (2011), and &quot;Amour&quot; (2012). They disagreed particularly on &quot;Romper Stomper&quot; (David refusing to rate it because of the racist violence in the film), &quot;The Castle&quot; (1997), &quot;Last Train to Freo&quot; (2006), &quot;Human Touch&quot; (2004), and &quot;Kenny&quot; (2006), with Stratton awarding fewer stars than Pomeranz on all but &quot;Human Touch&quot;.

<doc id="679124" wikidata="Q252580" url="?curid=679124" title="Duchy of Modena and Reggio">
<text>The Duchy of Modena and Reggio (; ; ) was an Italian state created in 1452 located in Northwestern Italy, in the present day region of Emilia-Romagna. It was ruled since its establishment by the noble House of Este, and from 1814 by the Austria-Este branch of the family. The Este dynasty was a great sponsor of the arts, making the Duchy a cultural reference during the Renaissance and Baroque periods.

==House of Este==
In 1452 Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III offered the duchy to Borso d&#x27;Este, whose family had ruled the city of Modena and nearby Reggio Emilia for centuries. Borso in 1450 had also succeeded his brother as margrave in the adjacent Papal Duchy of Ferrara, where he received the ducal title in 1471. The Este lands on the southern border of the Holy Roman Empire with the Papal States formed a stabilizing buffer state in the interest of both.

The first Este dukes ruled well and the city achieved an economic and cultural peak: Borso&#x27;s successor Duke Ercole I had the city of Modena rebuilt according to plans designed by Biagio Rossetti, his successors were patrons of artists like Titian and Ludovico Ariosto. In the War of the League of Cambrai from 1508, troops from Modena fought in Papal service against the Republic of Venice. Upon the death of Duke Alfonso II in 1597, the ducal line became extinct. The Este lands were bequeathed to Alfonso&#x27;s cousin Cesare d&#x27;Este; however, the succession was not acknowledged by Pope Clement VIII and Ferrara was finally seized by the Papacy. Cesare was able to retain Modena and Reggio as Imperial fiefs.

In the 1628 War of the Mantuan Succession, the dukes of Modena sided with Habsburg Spain and in turn received the town of Correggio from the hands of Emperor Ferdinand II. During the War of the Spanish Succession, Duke Rinaldo was ousted by French troops under Louis Joseph, Duke of Vendôme, he could not return until 1707. In 1711 the small Duchy of Mirandola was absorbed by the Este. His successor Francesco III backed France in the 1740 War of the Austrian Succession and was expelled by Habsburg forces, but his duchy was restored by the 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.
In 1796 Modena was again occupied by a French army under Napoleon, who deposed Duke Ercole III and created the Cispadane Republic out of his territory. By the 1801 Treaty of Lunéville, the last Este Duke was compensated with the Breisgau region of the former Further Austrian territories in southwestern Germany, and died in 1803. Following his death, the claims to the no longer existing ducal crown of Modena were inherited by his son-in-law, the Habsburg-Lorraine Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, an uncle of Emperor Francis II.

==House of Austria-Este==
With the dissolution of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy in 1814, following the final fall of Emperor Napoleon I after the Battle of Waterloo, Ferdinand&#x27;s son, Francis IV, again assumed the rule as Duke of Modena. In December 1815 he obtained the transfer from his mother Maria Beatrice d&#x27;Este of the former imperial fiefs in Lunigiana, not reconstituted by the Congress of Vienna and bestowed upon her, and, on her death in 1829, he also inherited the territories of Duchy of Massa and Carrara belonging to her suo jure.

In the course of the Italian unification period in the 1830s-60s, the &quot;Austria-Este&quot; dukes were briefly ousted in the revolutions of 1831 and 1848, but soon returned.

During the Second Italian War of Independence (April to July 1859) following the Battle of Magenta, the last Duke Francis V was again forced to flee, this time permanently. In December, Modena joined with Tuscany and Parma to form the &quot;United Provinces of Central Italy&quot;, which were annexed to the growing Kingdom of Sardinia in March 1860, which led the Italian unification movement, which further led to the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861.

<doc id="679125" wikidata="Q2626451" url="?curid=679125" title="Dallos">
<text>is a science fiction OVA series released in 1983. It was conceptualized by Hisayuki Toriumi, who also wrote the script and directed it with Mamoru Oshii. It is widely considered not only the first OVA released but also the first animated direct-to-video production release.

The storyline focuses on a rebellion on a Moon colony by settlers and a mysterious artifact called Dallos. The story and setting take influence by past works such as the 1966 feature film &quot;The Battle of Algiers&quot; and the 1966 novel &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot;.

==Story==
In the near future, humanity has drained the Earth of its resources. To sustain Earth&#x27;s populace, mining colonies are created on the Moon to provide vital natural resources.

After generations of mistreatment from the Earth Federal Government, the colonists retaliate by performing acts of terrorism leading directly to a conflict with their overseers. A mysterious structure on the Moon called Dallos is worshipped by the colonists and gives them hope. A young colonist by the name of Shun Nonomura is caught into the fray as he joins the rebels, dramatically affecting the lives of those close to him with his actions. A generational divide between the younger natural born colonists and their older compatriots arises as the allegiance to Earth as humanity&#x27;s motherland is questioned.

==Cast==

The compilation film &quot;Dallos Special&quot; has English and Spanish dubs, but of unknown actors. The Japanese cast is retained.

The characters Alex Leiger, Doug McCoy, and Erna are sometimes known as Alex &quot;Riger&quot;, &quot;Dog&quot; McCoy, and &quot;Elna&quot;; respectively.

==Episodes==

The four episodes were edited together to create the 85 minute-long film &quot;Dallos Special&quot; in 1985.

==Release==
In 1991, Celebrity Home Entertainment released the Toho English dub of &quot;Dallos Special&quot; on VHS under the title &quot;Battle for Moon Station Dallos&quot; but censored. This feature version was later reissued in 1995 by Best Film and Video Corp simply titled &quot;Dallos&quot;. Discotek Media released the OVA series in uncut form on DVD in 2014. The streaming platform Crunchyroll added the OVA series to its catalog in May 2015. On August 3, 2024, Discotek announced a Blu-ray release of the OVA to be released in September 2024.

In Spain, it was distributed, licensed, and dubbed onto VHS format by Chiqui Video during the 1980s.

<doc id="679128" wikidata="Q332177" url="?curid=679128" title="Ramón Power y Giralt">
<text>Captain Ramón Power y Giralt (October 7, 1775 – June 10, 1813) was a Spanish Navy officer and politician. According to historian Lidio Cruz Monclova, Power was among the first native-born Puerto Ricans to refer to himself as a &quot;Puerto Rican&quot; and to fight for the equal representation of Puerto Rico before the Cortes of Cádiz, the government of Spain at the time.

==Early years==

Power was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Joaquín Power y Morgan, a Spaniard from the Basque Country (of Irish and French descent) who came to Puerto Rico in connection with the &quot;Compañía de Asiento de Negros&quot;, which regulated the slave trade in the island, and María Josefa Giralt y Santaella, a Catalan from Barcelona. His great-grandfather Peter Power was an Irishman from Waterford who moved to Bordeaux and had a son Jean Baptiste Power Dubernet, who settled in Bilbao, where Ramon’s father Joaquín was born.
In San Juan he received his primary education at a private school. In 1788, when he was 13 years old, he was sent to Bilbao, Spain to continue his educational studies.

==Spanish Navy service==

At the age of 16, Power began his studies of naval science in Spain. Upon graduation he was commissioned a lieutenant in the Spanish Navy and eventually rose to the rank of Captain. In 1795, the Peace of Basel resulted in Spain ceding Santo Domingo to France, but the French did not take possession of the colony. Six years later in 1801, General Toussaint Louverture, a Black commander who was the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the neighboring French colony of Saint-Domingue, occupied Santo Domingo. Louverture&#x27;s occupation was met with anger by Napoleon, who dispatched an expedition to restore French rule in Saint-Domingue. The expedition&#x27;s troops captured Santo Domingo from Louverture&#x27;s army.

In 1808, following Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Spain, the &quot;criollos&quot; of Santo Domingo revolted against French rule. Colonel Rafael Conti, a fellow Puerto Rican, organized an expedition to restore Spanish rule in Santo Domingo. Power served in the expedition, which successfully recaptured Santo Domingo from the French with British assistance.

==Political career==

On May 4, 1809, in the midst of Peninsular War and Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s occupation of Spain, Power was elected by the five, local cabildos (town councils) to represent Puerto Rico in the &quot;Junta Suprema Central y Gubernativa del Reino&quot; (Supreme Central and Governing Board of the Kingdom). (In 1808 Napoleon had deposed Ferdinand VII and named his eldest brother, Joseph I, King of Spain. The &quot;Junta Suprema&quot; was leading the resistance against the Bonapartes.) The &quot;Junta Suprema&quot; dissolved itself before Power could arrive, nevertheless, the following year on April 16, he was again elected to represent Puerto Rico, this time in the Cortes of Cádiz, the parliamentary assembly serving as a Regency while awaiting Ferdinand VII&#x27;s return, that had been convened by the Junta and was gathering in the Southern Spanish port of Cádiz. One of his greatest supporters was Bishop Juan Alejo de Arizmendi, who during the official farewell Mass, gave Power his episcopal ring as a reminder that he should never forget his countrymen. After arriving in Cádiz on June 8, 1810, he joined the growing number of delegates, which finally reached a quorum in September. 

Power was an avid advocate for Puerto Rico during his tenure (September 24, 1810 — June 10, 1813) as a delegate in the Cortes. On September 25, 1810, the second day of regular meetings, he was elected as vice-president of the Cortes and succeeded in obtaining powers which would benefit the economy of the Puerto Rico. The most well-known product of the assembly was the Constitution of 1812.

Before the Constitution was written, Power convinced the Cortes to reverse a decree of the Council of Regency which had given the governor of Puerto Rico extraordinary powers in reaction to the establishment of juntas in South America. The highlight of his legislative career was the &quot;Ley Power&quot; (&quot;the Power Act&quot;), which designated five ports for free commerce. Thus, the ports of Fajardo, Mayagüez, Aguadilla, Cabo Rojo and Ponce established the reduction of most tariffs and eliminated the flour monopoly, in addition to establishing other economic reforms with the goal of developing a more efficient economy. It also called for the establishment of a Sociedad Económica de Amigos del País en Puerto Rico on the island, which was approved in 1814. Many of these reforms remained in effect even after Ferdinand VII revoked the Spanish Constitution.

==Death==
Power died while still in Cádiz on June 10, 1813, from the yellow fever epidemic which had spread throughout Europe. He was succeeded in the Cortes by José María Quiñones who served from November 25, 1813, to May 10, 1814. He was buried at the Oratorio de San Felipe Neri church in Cádiz.

==Repatriation of remains==
According to &quot;The San Juan Star&quot; (Puerto Rico&#x27;s English-language newspaper), a movement led by the Archbishop of San Juan, Roberto González Nieves, was successful in its attempt to bring Power&#x27;s remains back to Puerto Rico. Power&#x27;s remains were exhumed where he was interred along with other delegates&#x27; to the Cortes, at the church in Cadiz. 

After DNA testing, the remains were brought by the Spanish tall ship &quot;Juan Sebastián Elcano&quot;. On March 2, 2013, it left the port of Cádiz, stopping at Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Canary Islands before leaving on March 10 across the Atlantic Ocean taking 28 days to return Power y Giralt&#x27;s body to San Juan, Puerto Rico on April 6, 2013. It was escorted by the United States Coast Guard into the port and received with a 21 gun salute. Present to receive the remains were the Governor of Puerto Rico, and presidents of all branches of government.
His resting place now is at the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista next to Bishop Juan Alejo de Arizmendi.

==Honors and tributes==

Both Puerto Rico and Spain have honored Power&#x27;s memory, by naming several avenues after him. San Juan also has a school named after Power the &quot;Ramon Power y Giralt School&quot; located in Calle Loiza Final. The city of Ponce has a street named after him; it runs west to east and is located between (i.e., parallel to) Calle Ferrocarril and Avenida Las Américas, and has its western terminus at Calle Concordia and its eastern terminus at Avenida Hostos. 

His former residence was restored and currently houses the Puerto Rico Conservation Trust in Old San Juan. Power&#x27;s contemporary, José Campeche, honored him in a painting entitled &quot;The Shipwreck of Power&quot;. Graphic artist Lorenzo Homar has also dedicated one of his artistic works to Ramón Power.

<doc id="679132" wikidata="Q24296258" url="?curid=679132" title="USS Wilkes-Barre">
<text>USS &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; was a light cruiser of the United States Navy, which were built during World War II. The class was designed as a development of the earlier s, the size of which had been limited by the First London Naval Treaty. The start of the war led to the dissolution of the treaty system, but the dramatic need for new vessels precluded a new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s used the same hull as their predecessors, but were significantly heavier. The &quot;Cleveland&quot;s carried a main battery of twelve guns in four three-gun turrets, along with a secondary armament of twelve  dual-purpose guns. They had a top speed of .

==Design==

The &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class light cruisers traced their origin to design work done in the late 1930s; at the time, light cruiser displacement was limited to by the Second London Naval Treaty. Following the start of World War II in September 1939, Britain announced it would suspend the treaty for the duration of the conflict, a decision the US Navy quickly followed. Though still neutral, the United States recognized that war was likely and the urgent need for additional ships ruled out an entirely new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s were a close development of the earlier s, the chief difference being the substitution of a two-gun dual-purpose gun mount for one of the main battery gun turrets.

&quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . Her standard displacement amounted to and increased to at full load. The ship was powered by four General Electric steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Rated at , the turbines were intended to give a top speed of . Her crew numbered 1285 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve 6 in /47-caliber Mark 16 guns in four 3-gun turrets on the centerline. Two were placed forward in a superfiring pair; the other two turrets were placed aft of the superstructure in another superfiring pair. The secondary battery consisted of twelve /38-caliber dual-purpose guns mounted in twin turrets. Two of these were placed on the centerline, one directly behind the forward main turrets and the other just forward of the aft turrets. Two more were placed abreast of the conning tower and the other pair on either side of the aft superstructure. Anti-aircraft defense consisted of twenty-eight Bofors guns in four quadruple and six double mounts and ten Oerlikon guns in single mounts.

The ship&#x27;s belt armor ranged in thickness from , with the thicker section amidships where it protected the ammunition magazines and propulsion machinery spaces. Her deck armor was thick. The main battery turrets were protected with faces and sides and tops, and they were supported by barbettes 6 inches thick. &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot;″s conning tower had 5-inch sides.

==Service history==
The keel for &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; was laid down at New York Shipbuilding in Camden, New Jersey, on 14 December 1942. She was launched on 24 December 1943, and was commissioned on 1 July 1944 with the hull number CL-103. The ship embarked on her shakedown cruise, first in Chesapeake Bay, and later into the Atlantic, as far south as the Gulf of Paria in Trinidad in the British West Indies. After returning to Philadelphia, &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; departed on 23 October, bound for the Pacific. She passed through the Panama Canal four days later and then sailed north to San Diego, California, where she took on ammunition and other supplies. While there, she conducted shooting practice off San Clemente Island, and then got underway for Hawaii on 10 November. She arrived in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, a week later and took part in training exercises in the area into early December.

===South China Sea raid===

On 14 December, &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; left Pearl Harbor to join the rest of the American fleet, which was then at its forward anchorage at Ulithi in the Caroline Islands. On arrival, she was assigned to Cruiser Division 17, part of Task Force 38 (TF 38), otherwise known as the Fast Carrier Task Force, which was at that time assigned to 3rd Fleet. During this period, &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; was assigned to the subordinate unit Task Group 38.2, which was centered on the aircraft carriers , , and . The unit also included the fast battleships and , three other cruisers, and twenty destroyers.

The fleet sortied on 30 December to conduct the South China Sea raid. The fleet&#x27;s aircraft carriers launched a series of strikes against targets on Japanese-occupied Formosa and in the southern Ryuku Islands to neutralize Japanese airfields that might otherwise interfere with the imminent invasion of Luzon in the Philippines. The task force then turned to strike Japanese positions on Luzon itself. A further round of attacks on Formosa followed on 9 January 1945 and then moved to cover the flank of the force carrying out the invasion of Lingayen Gulf to block a possible attack by elements of the Japanese Navy.

Reports of Japanese warships off Cam Ranh Bay, French Indochina, on 12 January prompted the American command to detach &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot;, the rest of Cruiser Division 17, &quot;New Jersey&quot; and &quot;Wisconsin&quot;, and escorting destroyers to form Task Group 34.5 (TG 34.5). They were sent to sweep for Japanese vessels, but the cruisers&#x27; floatplanes were unable to locate any, and the division returned to TF 38 later that day. &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; and the rest of the fleet encountered severe weather on 13 and 14 January, temporarily pausing offensive operations. The carriers resumed attacks along the coast of occupied China on 15 January, shifted to Formosa on 21 January, and concluded with a final round of attacks on Okinawa in the Ryukus the following day. TF 38 then returned to Ulithi, arriving there on 26 January for repairs and to replenish ammunition and stores. While there, command of the unit passed to 5th Fleet and it was accordingly renumbered Task Force 58.

===Iwo Jima and Okinawa ===

&quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; and the rest of Cruiser Division 17 were transferred to TG 58.3, commanded by Rear Admiral Frederick C. Sherman. The unit also included the carriers , , and , the battleships &quot;New Jersey&quot; and , the large cruiser , two other cruisers, and fourteen destroyers. Over the course of operations during the next two months, the composition of the unit changed as vessels rotated out for repairs or maintenance. The fleet then sortied to carry out strikes on the Japanese capital, Tokyo, beginning on 16 February and lasting for two days. These attacks were intended to distract Japanese attention from the invasion of Iwo Jima. The fleet then sailed south to support the invasion directly, launching raids on the neighboring islands of Chichi Jima and Haha Jima while en route. On 19 February, the amphibious assault on Iwo Jima began. &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; was detached from the carrier screen two days later to provide gunfire support to the marines fighting ashore. The ship&#x27;s fire was directed by her OS2U Kingfisher floatplanes, and she was credited with destroying numerous defensive positions and ammunition dumps. Her guns also broke up an attempted counterattack from the Japanese defenders.

The ship returned to her position in the carrier screen in TG 58.3 on 23 February before the fleet departed to carry out another round of attacks of Tokyo on 25 February, followed by a raid on Okinawa on 1 March. The ships then returned to Ulithi to refuel and take on additional ammunition and stores. The fleet remained there from 5 to 14 March &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; took part in training exercises with other elements of the fleet, designated Task Force 59, on 14 and 15 March, before returning to TG 58.3 later on the 15th. The fast carrier task force then sortied for an attack on Japan, which began on 18 March and targeted the southernmost island of Kyushu. The following day, &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; shot down a Yokosuka D4Y &quot;Judy&quot; dive bomber. The Japanese nevertheless scored a pair of hits on the carrier , inflicting serious damage and forcing TG 58.3 to temporarily disengage to cover the crippled &quot;Franklin&quot; as she withdrew.

TG 58.3 resumed strikes on 23 March, targeting Okinawa through the next day to prepare for the upcoming invasion of Okinawa. &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; launched one of her Kingfishers to rescue two pilots who had been shot down off Minami Daito Shima on the 24th. &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; and the rest of Cruiser Division 17 bombarded a Japanese airfield on Minami Daito Shima on 27 March. Two days later, the fleet turned back north for additional strikes on Kyushu. &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; launched one of her Kingfishers to recover another pair of pilots from the carrier &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; who had been shot down off Yakushima during the attacks. American forces began to go ashore on Okinawa on 1 April, and TF 58 continued to support the operation, carrying out strikes on Japanese airfields in the region, including on Kyushu, Shikoku, and southern Honshu. The Japanese launched heavy air attacks in response, with a particular emphasis on tactics. On 11 April, &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot;″s anti-aircraft gunners claimed three Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters and an Aichi D3A &quot;Val&quot; dive bomber, along with partial credit for a further two Zeroes.
 
On 16 April, TF 58 embarked on another series of attacks on Japanese airfields on Kyushu. Late that day, at around 18:54, &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot;″s gunners shot down a Japanese bomber that attempted to attack the American carriers. The next morning, she shot down a Zero at 09:39. During the operations off Okinawa and southern Japan, &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; continued to employer her Kingfishers to rescue downed air crews, including a pair of pilots off Okinawa on 26 April. Further strikes on Japan were carried out over the first ten days on May, and on the 10th, &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; and the rest of Cruiser Division 17 were detached to form Task Group 58.3 along with a group of escorting destroyers to bombard Minami Daito Shima again. The ships returned to TF 58 the next day; the fleet was attacked by kamikazes that morning, and two of them struck &quot;Bunker Hill&quot;, inflicting serious damage. &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; was ordered to come alongside at 10:59 and assist with firefighting efforts. The cruiser placed her bow in contact with &quot;Bunker Hill&quot;s starboard quarter so some forty men, who were trapped by fires, could climb to safety aboard &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot;. The ship sent additional firefighting equipment aboard the carrier and took of injured men, and by 15:34, the fires had been extinguished, allowing &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; to pull away.

Thirteen men from &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; had died by 12 May, so a burial at sea was held that day; the remaining survivors were transferred to the hospital ship . Later on the 12th, TF 58 got underway to launch another round of strikes on the Kyushu airfields to further degrade the Japanese ability to interfere with the Okinawa invasion fleet. The raid began the following morning, and on 14 May, the Japanese launched an aerial counterattack. During the action, shell fragments, possibly from American guns, struck &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; and wounded nine men on the aft signal bridge. For their part, the ship&#x27;s gunners claimed partial credit for shooting down a Zero at 08:16. On 28 May, 3rd Fleet resumed command of the fast carrier task force, and &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot;″s unit was accordingly re-numbered TG 38.3. &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; was detached from the unit the next day to return to the Philippines for repairs and maintenance at San Pedro Bay that lasted from 1 to 20 June. Over the following three days, she took part in shooting practice and tactical training off Samar. She remained in the bay for the rest of the month.

===End of the war and occupation===
&quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; thereafter rejoined TF 38, again part of TG 38.3, which sortied on 1 July to begin the last major campaign of air strikes on Japan. The next week consisted of combat training exercises, and the first attacks on targets on Honshu and Hokkaido began on 10 July. On the 14th, &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; and several other vessels were detached to create Task Group 35.1; the unit also included , , and and six destroyers. They were sent to carry out a sweep for Japanese vessels off northern Honshu and in the Kii Channel, but they failed to locate any targets. &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; was again detached to join the bombardment force TG 35.3 on 24 July, along with &quot;Astoria&quot;, &quot;Pasadena&quot;, and &quot;Springfield&quot;. The ships shelled the seaplane base at Kushimoto that evening and later bombarded Cape Shionomisaki. Further carrier strikes were conducted in late July, but bad weather forced the fleet to temporarily withdraw in early August. The fleet returned to the Japanese coast on 8 August and resumed air attacks on the 9th and 10th, by which time both atomic bombs had been dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. By 15 August, the Japanese government had agreed to surrender, ending the war. For her service during the conflict, &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; received four battle stars.

The ships of Cruiser Division 17 were detached from TG 38.3 on 23 August. Four days later, they joined the fleet that steamed into Sagami Bay, which lays outside Tokyo Bay, where the surrender ceremony was to take place on 2 September. On the 3rd, &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; entered Tokyo Bay as preparations for the occupation of Japan began. The vessel was designated the flagship of Task Unit 35.7.2., one of the occupation groups, which was assigned the task of occupying the naval base at Tateyama. There, midget submarines and kamikaze boats were seized on 10 September. &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; then returned to Tokyo, laying in Sagami Bay from 12 to 14 September to supervise the demilitarization of midget submarine bases at Aburatsubo and Kurihama. After refueling in Tokyo Bay later on the 14th, the cruiser sailed for Onagawa, where she assisted occupation forces from 15 to 17 September. She thereafter moved to Katsuura and returned to Tokyo on 24 September.

&quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; anchored off Tokyo from 24 September to 4 October, and thereafter took part in training maneuvers from 24 to 28 October. By that time, 5th Fleet had resumed control of the American fleet in Japan. &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; was detached on 5 November and sent to formerly-Japanese-controlled Korea on the 9th; she arrived at Inchon on 13 November. There, she joined the destroyers and , which sailed together to Qingdao, China, which had also been under Japanese occupation. The ships oversaw the demilitarization of Japanese forces there until 19 November, before shifting to Taku and Qinhuangdao, China, for the same duty. &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; later returned to Qingdao and remained there through the end of the year.

===Postwar career and fate===
On 13 January 1946, &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; departed Qingdao, bound for the United States. She stopped in Pearl Harbor on the way to the West Coast of the United States, finally arriving in San Pedro, California, on 31 January. She remained there only briefly, before getting underway on 4 March to move to the East Coast of the United States. After passing through the Panama Canal between 12 and 14 March, the ship arrived in Philadelphia on 18 March. On 20 October, she sailed south to participate in the Navy Day celebrations in New Orleans on 27 October. &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; thereafter steamed to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where she joined her sister ships and for training exercises. On 13 December, the ship arrived in Norfolk, Virginia.

&quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; embarked on a goodwill cruise to northern Europe on 17 February 1947. She stopped in Plymouth in the United Kingdom on 27 February and cruised in British waters over the course of March and April, during which time she sailed to Bergen, Norway. She thereafter returned to the United States, where she was assigned to the United States Reserve Fleet. She was decommissioned on 9 October and assigned to the reserve fleet based in Philadelphia. She remained there until she was struck from the naval register on 15 January 1971; she was the last light cruiser in the Navy&#x27;s inventory. The ship was allocated for disposal in underwater weapons tests. During one such test off the Florida Keys on 12 May 1972, the old cruiser&#x27;s hull broke in half. The stern section sank that day, but the bow remained afloat until it was sunk with a scuttling charge the following day.

The two sections of &quot;Wilkes-Barre&quot; have developed into artificial reefs, and are a popular deep wreck diving site. The wreck sits upright on the ocean floor at a depth of , and the upper deck rests at a depth of about , but the highest point of the wreck is at . According to the diver and author Steven Singer, the site is suitable only for experienced divers.

<doc id="679134" wikidata="Q165040" url="?curid=679134" title="Duchy of Parma and Piacenza">
<text>The Duchy of Parma and Piacenza (, ) was an Italian state created in 1545 and located in northern Italy, in the current region of Emilia-Romagna.

Originally a realm of the Farnese family after Pope Paul III made it a hereditary duchy for his son, Pier Luigi Farnese, it was ruled by the dynasty until 1731, when the last duke, Antonio Farnese, died without direct heirs. After a decade of Habsburg rule, the duchy passed to the House of Bourbon-Parma.

It was invaded by Napoleon and annexed by France, having its sovereignty restored in 1814 after Napoleon&#x27;s defeat. Napoleon&#x27;s wife, Marie Louise (&quot;Maria Luigia&quot;), then ruled as its duchess until her death. Parma was restored to Bourbon rule in 1847, and in 1859, the duchy was formally abolished as it was integrated into the new Italian state.

==History==
The Duchy of Parma was created by Pope Paul III (Alessandro Farnese) in 1545 from former parts of the Duchy of Milan south of the Po River which had been conquered by the Papal States in 1512. These territories, centered on the city of Parma, were given as a fief to Paul III&#x27;s illegitimate son, Pier Luigi Farnese.

In 1556, the second Duke, Ottavio Farnese, was given the city of Piacenza, becoming thus also Duke of Piacenza, and so the state was thereafter known as the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza (). In 1587, during the rule of Duke Alessandro Farnese, the Stato Pallavicino, an absolute monarchy feudal state in northwestern Emilia, encompassing the Marchesates of Busseto and Cortemaggiore, was annexed into the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza. This annexation expanded the duchy&#x27;s territory and consolidated Farnese influence over the region. The Stato Pallavicino had been an autonomous entity under the Pallavicino family since 1394, but its absorption marked the end of its independence. The Farnese family continued to rule until the extinction of their male line in 1731.

=== The consolidation of the duchy ===
Ottavio Farnese strove to make the duchy prosperous, to win the benevolence of the people by applying the wise measures already taken by his father and to flatter the local nobility using more moderation than Pier Luigi, he knew how to consolidate the duchy by promoting its economy and financial and commercial exchanges and cultural, it started the territorial expansion with the annexation of some fiefdoms. In 1573 the number of inhabitants of the new capital had increased considerably reaching 26,000. Alessandro Farnese, who was also an important general of the Spanish army, succeeding the leadership of the duchy, was forced by the King Philip II of Spain to appoint his seventeen-year-old son Ranuccio I Farnese, as regent, since the Spanish King did not want to deprive himself of the able and valiant general.

Alessandro died far from Parma on 3 December 1592 from gangrene caused by an arquebus ball during the Siege of Can de Bec, a year before his death he ordered the construction of the fortress of the Citadel with the aim of affirming the power of the family but also to provide work to a labor force of 2,500 people made up mostly of the poor sections of the city population. Ranuccio I, passionate about arts and music, made the ducal court the first in Italy in the musical arts. During this period, the city was enriched with unique monuments, such as the Palazzo della Pilotta, Palazzo Ducale and the Teatro Farnese, modern legislation was passed, which made Parma a center of excellence both in terms of lifestyle and as an architectural model, elevating it as a cultural capital to the same level of other important European capitals. His government was guilty of the public execution of over 100 Parma citizens accused of conspiring against him. In 1628, on the death of Ranuccio I, the duchy was passed on to his just sixteen-year-old son Odoardo, who on 11 October of the same year married the fifteen-year-old Margherita de&#x27; Medici in Florence, daughter of Cosimo II de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany.

These were difficult years for the duchy, in addition to the terrible plague of 1630 which decimated the population, the new duke maintained an army of 6,000 infantry and to finance it he forced his subjects into severe deprivation, getting into debt with bankers and merchants. Despite the high expenses incurred, his first campaign was negative: Piacenza was occupied by the Spanish troops, his troops were defeated in Parma territory by Francesco I d&#x27;Este, Duke of Modena, and Odoardo was forced to sign a peace treaty with Spain under which, once the alliance with France was dissolved, he would have evacuated Piacenza.

On his death, which took place in Piacenza on 11 September 1646 at the age of 34, the duchy passed to his son Ranuccio II and for two years the regency was ensured by his wife Margherita de&#x27; Medici and by his uncle the Cardinal Francesco Maria Farnese, until the age of eighteen. In 1691 the Duchy of Parma was invaded by the Imperial army and plundered by the four thousand soldiers who arrived in Parma with women and children; not only their maintenance fell on the subjects, but rape, abuse and violence followed one another without respite. Ranuccio II made many works to improve the situation of his subjects, but the contrast between the carefree life of the court and the coffers of the treasury was truly remarkable and to keep all the characters who rotated at the court of Parma, the duke was forced to tax everything, avoiding, however, touching the ecclesiastical income. During his reign, Ranuccio II bought precious paintings and volumes, he moved most of the works belonging to the family collections preserved in the Roman residences to Parma and in 1688 the new Ducal Theater was inaugurated. Ranuccio II had a son destined to succeed him, Odoardo, who, however, predeceased his father and therefore never governed the duchy.

Three years before his death, thanks to the mediation of the ambassador Count Fabio Perletti, Odoardo had married Countess Palatine Dorothea Sophie of Neuburg, with whom he had two children: Alessandro, who died at the age of eight months, and Elisabeth. On 11 December 1694, upon the sudden death of Ranuccio II, the duchy then passed into the hands of the just sixteen-year-old second son Francesco, who married the widow of his brother Dorothea.

=== Rule of Francesco Farnese ===
Francesco Farnese&#x27;s work fully brought the Farnese dynasty back to the center of great politics. Having inherited a disastrous financial situation, in order to try to heal it he cut all the unnecessary expenses of the court by firing most of the servants, musicians, jesters and dwarves. He also abolished performances, court parties and banquets. A hydraulic work was built to defend the city of Piacenza from the erosion of the Po, the expansion of the University of Parma and the Collegio dei Nobili was favored, encouraging the study of public law, history, languages and geography. Artists, writers, musicians and playwrights enjoyed the protection of the Court. In 1712 the renovation works of the Ducal Palace of Colorno began, completed in 1730. In 1714 the duchy achieved an important diplomatic success when Francesco, thanks to the offices of his ambassador in Spain Giulio Alberoni, was able to marry his niece Elisabeth to King Philip V of Spain, who had been widowed earlier that year.

=== Extinction of the Farnese and House of Bourbon-Parma ===

Because of the lack of male heirs, Elisabeth Farnese, niece of Duke Antonio Farnese, was declared the Farnese heiress. She received many marriage proposals, finally marrying in 1714 Philip V of Spain. On the death of childless Duke Antonio in 1731, Philip V asserted the rights that his wife had over the duchies according to the agreements signed in the Treaty of Vienna of 1725 and the Treaty of Seville of 1729, and he claimed both for the Spanish House of Bourbon. The Duchy would thus be inherited by his first son with Elisabeth, Infante Carlos of Spain, who reigned as Duke Charles I of Parma and Piacenza. He ruled his territories for four years until the end of the War of the Polish Succession, when, according to what was established in the Treaty of Vienna (1738), he handed over both duchies to the House of Habsburg in exchange for the Kingdoms of Naples and Sicily.

The Habsburgs only ruled until the conclusion of the War of the Austrian Succession in 1748, whose final peace treaty, the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, ceded back the duchy to the Bourbons in the person of Infante Philip of Spain, younger brother of Charles I. Duke Philip became the founder of the House of Bourbon-Parma, reigning over an expanded Duchy of Parma, Piacenza and Guastalla (), the Gonzaga rulers of neighbouring Guastalla having died out in 1746.

In 1796, the duchy was occupied by French troops under Napoleon, and the political situation of the state became extremely confused. Ferdinand maintained his throne under French military governors until the Treaty of Aranjuez of 1801, when a general agreement between the House of Bourbon and Napoleon formally decided the cession of the duchy to France in exchange for Tuscany, but the Duke remained in Parma until he died in 1802.

=== Napoleonic era (1796-1814) ===
Napoleon Bonaparte was undecided about the future of the duchy, aspiring to a total engagement of the Bourbons in the European wars as his allies. Even as French laws and administration were gradually introduced, the formal annexation to the French Empire was declared only in 1808 after the outbreak of the Peninsular War. The duchy was reformed as the &quot;département&quot; of Taro.

=== Last decades of the duchy (1814 to 1860) ===
In 1814, the duchies were given to Napoleon&#x27;s Habsburg wife, Marie-Louise, styled in Italian Maria-Luigia, who ruled them for the rest of her life. After her death in 1847, the Duchy was restored to the Bourbon-Parma family, which had been ruling the tiny Duchy of Lucca. Guastalla was ceded to Modena. The Bourbons ruled until 1859, when they were driven out by a revolution following the French and Sardinian victory in the war against Austria (called Austrian War in France and Second War of Independence in Italy). It was the only case in Italy where the ruling monarchs were successfully driven out by two consecutive uprisings, both in 1848 and 1859: the reasons behind this are to be found both in the rising aspiration for Italian unification and a strong despise towards the Bourbons, after the less reactionary reign of Marie Louise.

In December 1859, the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza was combined with the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the Duchy of Modena to form the United Provinces of Central Italy. In March 1860, after a referendum, this merged with the Kingdom of Sardinia, which in 1861 changed its name to the Kingdom of Italy.

<doc id="679144" wikidata="Q741276" url="?curid=679144" title="Lenticular cloud">
<text>Lenticular clouds (, ) are stationary clouds that form mostly in the troposphere, typically in parallel alignment to the wind direction. They are often comparable in appearance to a lens or saucer. Nacreous clouds that form in the lower stratosphere sometimes have lenticular shapes.

There are three main types of lenticular clouds: altocumulus standing lenticular (ACSL), stratocumulus standing lenticular (SCSL), and cirrocumulus standing lenticular (CCSL), varying in altitude above the ground.

==Formation and appearance==
As air travels along the surface of the Earth, obstructions are often encountered, including natural features, such as mountains or hills, and artificial structures, such as buildings and other constructions, which disrupt the flow of air into &quot;eddies&quot;, or areas of turbulence.

When moist, stable air flows over a larger eddy, such as those caused by mountains, a series of large-scale standing waves form on the leeward side of the mountain. If the temperature at the crest of the wave drops below the dew point, moisture in the air may condense to form lenticular clouds. Under certain conditions, long strings of lenticular clouds may form near the crest of each successive wave, creating a formation known as a &quot;wave cloud&quot;. Those wave systems can produce large updrafts, occasionally enough for water vapour to condense and produce precipitation.

Lenticular clouds have been said to be mistaken for UFOs, because many of them have the shape of a &quot;flying saucer&quot;, with a characteristic &quot;lens&quot; or smooth, saucer-like shape. Lenticular clouds generally do not form over low-lying or flat terrain, so many people may have never seen one before and don&#x27;t know that they can exist. Bright colours (called iridescence) are sometimes seen along the edge of lenticular clouds.

==Flight==
Pilots of powered aircraft tend to avoid flying near lenticular clouds because of the turbulence and sinking air of the rotor generated at the trailing edge of these clouds, but glider pilots actively seek them out in order to climb in the upward moving air at the leading edge. The precise location of the rising air mass is fairly easy to predict from the orientation of the clouds. &quot;Wave lift&quot; of this kind is often very smooth and strong, and enables gliders to soar to remarkable altitudes and to cover great distances. , the gliding world records for both distance (over 3,000 km; 1,864 mi) and absolute altitude (over 22,000 metres; 74,334 ft) were set using such lift.

<text>The Appoquinimink River is a river flowing to Delaware Bay in northern Delaware in the United States. The river is long and drains an area of on the Atlantic Coastal Plain.

The Appoquinimink flows for its entire length in southern New Castle County. It rises approximately west of Townsend and flows generally eastwardly, south of Middletown and past Odessa, to its mouth at the northern end of Delaware Bay, approximately east of Odessa. In its upper course the river passes through two man-made lakes, Wiggins Mill Pond and Noxontown Lake; the river is tidal to the dam at Noxontown Lake, and salinity from Delaware Bay typically affects the lowermost of the river. The lower of the river are considered to be navigable by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

It collects three named tributaries along its course: From the north, Deep Creek, long (also known historically as the &quot;North Appoquinimink River&quot;); and Drawyers Creek, long; and from the south, Hangmans Run.

According to 2002 data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency, 54.9% of the Appoquinimink River watershed is occupied by agricultural uses (predominantly soybeans, corn, and wheat); 15.1% is residential; 9.9% is wetland; and 8.8% is forested.

In 2004, a non-profit group, The Appoquinimink River Association, was founded with a mission to protect the water and natural resources in the region surrounding the Appoquinimink River.

==Variant names and spellings==
The United States Board on Geographic Names issued a decision clarifying the stream&#x27;s name in 1950. According to the Geographic Names Information System, the Appoquinimink River has also been known historically as:

<doc id="679153" wikidata="Q154849" url="?curid=679153" title="Grand Duchy of Tuscany">
<text>The Grand Duchy of Tuscany (; ) was an Italian monarchy that existed, with interruptions, from 1569 to 1860, replacing the Republic of Florence. The grand duchy&#x27;s capital was Florence. In the 19th century the population of the Grand Duchy was about 1,815,000 inhabitants.

Having brought nearly all Tuscany under his control after conquering the Republic of Siena, Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici, was elevated by a papal bull of Pope Pius V to Grand Duke of Tuscany on 27 August 1569. The Grand Duchy was ruled by the House of Medici until the extinction of its senior branch in 1737. While not as internationally renowned as the old republic, the grand duchy thrived under the Medici and it bore witness to unprecedented economic and military success under Cosimo I and his sons, until the reign of Ferdinando II, which saw the beginning of the state&#x27;s long economic decline. That economic decline continued under Cosimo III.

Francis Stephen of Lorraine, a cognatic descendant of the Medici, succeeded the family and ascended the throne of his Medicean ancestors. Tuscany was governed by a viceroy, Marc de Beauvau-Craon, for his entire rule. His descendants ruled, and resided in, the grand duchy until its end in 1859, barring one interruption, when Napoleon Bonaparte gave Tuscany to the House of Bourbon-Parma (Kingdom of Etruria, 1801–1807), then annexed it directly to the First French Empire. Following the collapse of the Napoleonic system in 1814, the grand duchy was restored. The United Provinces of Central Italy, a client state of the Kingdom of Sardinia, annexed Tuscany in 1859. Tuscany was formally annexed in 1860, as a part of the unification of Italy, following a landslide referendum, in which 95% of voters approved.

==Medici period==

===Foundation===

In 1569, Cosimo de&#x27; Medici had ruled the Duchy of Florence for 32 years. During his reign, Florence purchased the island of Elba from the Republic of Genoa (in 1548), conquered Siena (in 1555) and developed a well-equipped and powerful naval base on Elba. Cosimo also banned the clergy from holding administrative positions and promulgated laws of freedom of religion, which were unknown during his time. Cosimo also was a long-term supporter of Pope Pius V, who in the light of Florence&#x27;s expansion in August 1569, declared Cosimo Grand Duke of Tuscany, a title unprecedented in Italy.

The international reaction to Cosimo&#x27;s elevation was bleak. Queen Catherine of France, though herself a Medici, viewed Cosimo with the utmost disdain. Rumours circulated at the Viennese court that had Cosimo as a candidate for King of England. Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor and his cousin King Philip II of Spain reacted quite angrily, as Florence was in theory an Imperial fief and declared Pius V&#x27;s actions invalid. However, Maximilian eventually confirmed the elevation with an Imperial diploma in 1576. Subsequently, to end animosities with Maximilian, Cosimo &quot;bought&quot; the grand ducal title from him for 100,000 ducats.

During the Holy League of 1571, Cosimo fought against the Ottoman Empire, siding with the other Catholic powers, such as Venice and the Spanish Empire. The Holy League inflicted a crushing defeat against the Ottomans at the Battle of Lepanto. Cosimo&#x27;s reign was one of the most militaristic Tuscany had ever seen.

Cosimo experienced several personal tragedies during the later years of his reign. His wife, Eleanor of Toledo, died in 1562, along with four of his children due to a plague epidemic in Florence. These deaths were to affect him greatly, which, along with illness, forced Cosimo to unofficially abdicate in 1564. This left his eldest son, Francesco, to rule the duchy. Cosimo I died in 1574 of apoplexy, leaving a stable and extremely prosperous Tuscany behind him, having been the longest ruling Medici yet.

===Francesco and Ferdinando I===
Francesco had little interest in governing his realm, instead participating in scientific experiments. The administration of the state was delegated to bureaucrats. He continued his father&#x27;s Austrian/Imperial alliance, cementing it by marrying Johanna of Austria. Francesco is best remembered for dying on the same day as his second wife, Bianca Cappello, spurring rumours of poisoning. He was succeeded by Ferdinando de&#x27; Medici, his younger brother, whom he loathed.

Ferdinando eagerly assumed the government of Tuscany. He commanded the draining of the Tuscan marshlands, built a road network in Southern Tuscany, and cultivated trade in Livorno. To augment the Tuscan silk industry, he oversaw the planting of mulberry trees along the major roads (silk worms feed on mulberry leaves). He shifted Tuscany away from Habsburg hegemony by marrying the first non-Habsburg candidate since Alessandro de&#x27; Medici, Duke of Florence, Christina of Lorraine, a granddaughter of Catherine de&#x27; Medici. The Spanish reaction was to construct a citadel on their portion of the island of Elba. To strengthen the new Tuscan alliance, he married the deceased Francesco&#x27;s younger daughter, Marie, to Henry IV of France. Henry explicitly stated that he would defend Tuscany from Spanish aggression, but later reneged. Ferdinando was forced to marry his heir, Cosimo II, to Archduchess Maria Maddalena of Austria to assuage Spain (where Maria Maddalena&#x27;s sister was the incumbent Queen consort). Ferdinando sponsored a Tuscan colony in America, with the intention of establishing a Tuscan settlement in the area of what is now French Guiana. Despite all of these incentives to economic growth and prosperity, the population of Florence, at dawn of the 17th century, was a mere 75,000 souls, far smaller than the other capitals of Italy: Rome, Milan, Venice, Palermo and Naples. Francesco and Ferdinando, due to lax distinction between Medici and Tuscan state property, are thought to have been wealthier than their ancestor, Cosimo de&#x27; Medici, the founder of the dynasty. The Grand Duke alone had the prerogative to exploit the state&#x27;s mineral and salt resources. The fortunes of the Medici were directly tied to the Tuscan economy.

Ferdinando, despite no longer being a cardinal, exercised much influence at successive Papal conclaves; elections which chose the Pope, the head of the Catholic Church. In 1605, Ferdinando succeeded in getting his candidate, Alessandro de&#x27; Medici, elected as Pope Leo XI. Leo XI died less than a month later, but fortunately for the Medici his successor Pope Paul V was also pro-Medici. Ferdinando&#x27;s pro-Papal foreign policy, however, had drawbacks. Tuscany was overcome with religious orders, all of whom were not obliged to pay taxes. Ferdinando died in 1609, leaving an affluent realm; however, his inaction in international affairs drew Tuscany into the provincial yolk of politics.

===Cosimo II and Ferdinando II===
Ferdinando&#x27;s elder son, Cosimo, mounted the throne following his death. Like his uncle, Francesco I, government held no appeal for him, and Tuscany was ruled by his ministers. Cosimo II&#x27;s twelve-year reign was punctuated by his contented marriage with Maria Maddalena and his patronage of astronomer Galileo Galilei.

When Cosimo died, his oldest son, Ferdinando, was still a minor. This led to a regency of Ferdinand&#x27;s grandmother, Dowager Grand Duchess Christina, and his mother, Maria Maddalena of Austria. Christina heavily relied on priests as advisors, lifting Cosimo I&#x27;s ban on clergy holding administrative roles in government, and promoted monasticism. Christina dominated her grandson long after he came of age until her death in 1636. His mother and grandmother arranged a marriage with Vittoria della Rovere, the granddaughter of Francesco Maria II della Rovere, Duke of Urbino, in 1634. Together they had two children: Cosimo (III), in 1642, and Francesco, in 1660.

Ferdinando was obsessed with new technology, and had several hygrometers, barometers, thermometers, and telescopes installed in the Pitti. In 1657, Leopoldo de&#x27; Medici, the Grand Duke&#x27;s youngest brother, established the Accademia del Cimento, which set up to attract scientists from all over Tuscany to Florence for mutual study.

Tuscany was one of the states of the Holy Roman Empire that sided with the Emperor in the Thirty Years War, sending thousands of troops to support the pro-Imperial side from 1631. Among the commanders of the detachment were three of the grand duke&#x27;s brothers; two died and one, Mattias de&#x27;Medici, became general of artillery and served for a decade. Like the Empire&#x27;s other loyal Italian subjects, the Tuscans were &quot;hawks&quot; who supported prosecuting the war to its conclusion. Francesco de&#x27; Medici, Mattias de&#x27;Medici, and Ottavio Piccolomini (an Imperial general of Sienese origin) were among the ringleaders in the plot to assassinate field marshal Albrecht von Wallenstein, for which they were rewarded with spoils by Emperor Ferdinand II.

Tuscany participated in the Wars of Castro (the last time Medicean Tuscany proper was involved in a conflict) and inflicted a defeat on the forces of Pope Urban VIII in 1643. The treasury was so empty that when the Castro mercenaries were paid for, the state could no longer afford to pay interest on government bonds. The interest rate was lowered by 0.75%. The economy was so decrepit that barter trade became prevalent in rural market places. The exchequer was barely adequate to cover the state&#x27;s current expenditure, resulting in a complete termination of banking operations for the Medici. Ferdinando II died in 1670, succeeded by his oldest surviving son Cosimo.

===Cosimo III===
Cosimo III&#x27;s reign was characterised by drastic changes and a sharp decline of the Grand Duchy. Cosimo III was of a puritan character, banning May celebrations, forcing prostitutes to pay for licenses, and beheading sodomites. He also instituted several laws censoring education and introduced anti-Jewish legislation. He imposed crippling taxes while the country&#x27;s population continued to decline. By 1705, the grand ducal treasury was virtually bankrupt, and the population of Florence had declined by approximately 50%, while the population of the entire grand duchy had decreased by an estimated 40%. The once powerful navy was reduced to a pitiful state.

Cosimo frequently paid the Holy Roman Emperor, his feudal overlord, high dues. He sent munitions to the Emperor during the Battle of Vienna. Tuscany was neutral during the War of the Spanish Succession, partly due to Tuscany&#x27;s ramshackle military; a 1718 military review revealed that the army numbered less than 3,000 men, many of whom were infirm and elderly. Meanwhile, the state&#x27;s capital, Florence, had become full of beggars. Europe heard of the perils of Tuscany, and Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor asserted a remote claim to the grand duchy (through some Medici descent), but died before he could press the matter. The Treaty of the Hague reconfirmed the statuses of Tuscany and Parma-Piacenza as imperial fiefs.

Cosimo married Marguerite Louise d&#x27;Orléans, a granddaughter of Henry IV of France and Marie de&#x27; Medici. Their union wrought a high level of discontentment, but despite the tension they had three children, Ferdinando, Anna Maria Luisa de&#x27; Medici, Electress Palatine and the last Medicean grand duke of Tuscany, Gian Gastone de&#x27; Medici.

Cosimo contemplated restoring the Republic of Florence, a decision that was complicated by the Grand Duchy&#x27;s feudal status: Florence was an Imperial fief, Siena a Spanish one. The plan was about to be approved by the powers convened at Geertruidenberg when Cosimo abruptly added that if himself and his two sons predeceased his daughter, the Electress Palatine, she should succeed and the republic be re-instituted following her death. The proposal sank, and ultimately died with Cosimo in 1723.

===The last years of the Medicis===
As Grand Prince Ferdinando, Gian Gastone&#x27;s elder brother, predeceased Cosimo III, Gian Gastone succeeded his father in 1723. Gian Gastone for most of his life, kept to his bed and acted in an unregal manner, rarely appearing to his subjects, to the extent that, at times, he had been thought dead. Gian Gastone would repeal his father&#x27;s puritan laws. In 1731, the Powers gathered at Vienna to decide who would succeed Gian Gastone. They drew up the Treaty of Vienna, which gave the grand ducal throne to Don Carlos, Duke of Parma. Gian Gastone was not as steadfast in negotiating Tuscany&#x27;s future as his father was. He capitulated to foreign demands, and instead of endorsing the claim to the throne of his closest male relative, the Prince of Ottajano, he allowed Tuscany to be bestowed upon Don Carlos. During the War of the Polish Succession, Don Carlos conquered the Kingdom of Naples and was forced to give up the Tuscan succession by the Treaty of Vienna (1738). Soon after, Francis Stephen of Lorraine became heir to the Tuscan throne. Gian Gastone had no say in events and had become quite attached to the Spanish Infante. The Tuscans despised the new occupying &quot;Lorrainers&quot;, as they interfered with the Tuscan government, while the occupying Spaniards had not done so. On 9 July 1737, Gian Gastone died; the last male Medici of the grand ducal line.

==House of Habsburg-Lorraine==

===Francis Stephen===
Francis I (as Francis Stephen became known) lived in Florence briefly with his wife, the Habsburg heiress Maria Theresa, who became Tuscany&#x27;s grand duchess. Francis had to cede his ancestral Duchy of Lorraine in order to accommodate the deposed ruler of Poland, whose daughter Marie Leszczyńska was Queen of France. Marie&#x27;s father Stanisław Leszczyński ruled Lorraine as compensation for his loss of the Kingdom of Poland. Francis was reluctant to resign the duchy, but Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor (Maria Theresa&#x27;s father) stated that if he did not relinquish his rights to Lorraine, he could not marry Maria Theresa. Francis did not live in his Tuscan realm, and lived in the capital of his wife&#x27;s realm, Vienna. He was elected Holy Roman Emperor in 1745. He died at Innsbruck from a stroke in 1765; his wife pledged the rest of her life to mourning him, while co-ruling with her first son, her own heir apparent, and Francis&#x27; imperial successor Joseph II.

The administrative structure of the grand duchy itself would see little change under Francis I. Since their accession to the throne of Grand Dukes, however, the Habsburgs continually tried to make Tuscany a source of military power, to little success, as Tuscany had declined and demilitarized in the 18th century. Such was the failure of their initial effort that Vienna declared Tuscany to be neutral during the War of the Austrian Succession, and enemy troops crossed it unopposed. At that time the Habsburgs&#x27; efforts had only managed to muster a standing army of 3,000 poorly-trained troops. A modest plan to create a 5,000-strong Tuscan army under German officers was only semi-successful. Tuscan troops served the Emperor in Silesia during the Seven Years&#x27; War. The first contingent of 3,000 troops arrived in 1758, followed by a second contingent of 1,500, and subsequent smaller ones to replace losses from battle and disease. The fear that the Emperor would impose conscription on the duchy caused 2% of the population to flee to the Papal States.

In 1763, when nuptial agreements for the marriage of the imperial couple&#x27;s second surviving son, Leopold, and the Infanta of Spain, Maria Luisa of Bourbon, were stipulated, Tuscany was erected into a secundogeniture. Thus, upon the death of Francis I, it was Leopold who directly succeeded him on the throne of the Grand Duchy.

===Reform===
Leopold, usually referred to in Italy as &quot;Pietro Leopoldo&quot;, ruled the country until his brother Joseph&#x27;s death and his own election as Holy Roman Emperor in 1790. He was unpopular among his subjects, though his many reforms brought the Grand Duchy to a level of stability that had not been seen in quite a while.

Leopold developed and supported many social and economic reforms. He revamped the taxation and tariff system. Smallpox vaccination was made systematically available (Leopold&#x27;s mother Maria Theresa had been a huge supporter of inoculation against smallpox), and an early institution for the rehabilitation of juvenile delinquents was founded. Leopold also abolished capital punishment. On 30 November 1786, after having de facto blocked capital executions (the last was in 1769), Leopold promulgated the reform of the penal code that abolished the death penalty and ordered the destruction of all the instruments for capital execution in his land. Torture was also banned.

Leopold also introduced radical reforms to the system of neglect and inhumane treatment of the mentally ill. On 23 January 1774, the &quot;legge sui pazzi&quot; (law regarding the insane) was established, the first of its kind to be introduced in Europe, allowing steps to be taken to hospitalize individuals deemed insane. A few years later Leopold undertook the project of building a new hospital, the Bonifacio. He used his skill at choosing collaborators to put a young physician, Vincenzo Chiarugi, at its head. Chiarugi and his collaborators introduced new humanitarian regulations in the running of the hospital and caring for the mentally ill patients, including banning the use of chains and physical punishment, and in so doing have been recognized as early pioneers of what later came to be known as the moral treatment movement.

Leopold attempted to secularize the property of the religious houses or to put the clergy entirely under the control of the government. These measures, which disturbed the deeply rooted convictions of his people and brought him into collision with the pope, were not successful.

Leopold also approved and collaborated on the development of a political constitution, said to have anticipated by many years the promulgation of the French constitution and which presented some similarities with the Virginia Bill of Rights of 1778. Leopold&#x27;s concept of this was based on respect for the political rights of citizens and on a harmony of power between the executive and the legislative. However, the constitution was so radically new that it garnered opposition even from those who might have benefited from it. In 1790, Emperor Joseph II died without issue before carrying out his project for the abolition of secundogeniture in Tuscany, partly due to Leopold&#x27;s latent resistance. Thus, when the latter was called to Vienna, to assume the rule of his family&#x27;s Austrian dominions and become Emperor, his second-born son Ferdinand immediately succeeded him as head of the Grand Duchy. Leopold himself died in 1792.

Following the serious Sanfedist disorders that occurred in Tuscany upon Leopold&#x27;s departure for Austria, the new emperor partially revoked the abolition of the death penalty ordered 4 years earlier, and in 1795 Ferdinand further expanded the scope of its application.

===Tuscany during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars===
Leopold was succeeded by Ferdinand III. Ferdinand was the son of Leopold I, and Grand Duchess Maria Louisa. He was forced out by the French during the French Revolutionary Wars, first in spring 1799 when a jacobin provisional government was created by the French army, and then after the Treaty of Aranjuez (1801), becoming instead Elector of Salzburg, ruling the territory of the former archbishopric. The Grand Duchy was then dissolved, and replaced by the Kingdom of Etruria under the House of Bourbon-Parma, in compensation for their loss of Duchy of Parma. In 1803, the first King of Etruria, Louis I, died and was succeeded by his infant son, Charles Louis, under the regency of his mother, Queen María Luisa.

Etruria lasted less than a decade. By the Treaty of Fontainebleau (27 October 1807), Etruria was to be annexed by France. The negotiations had been between Spain and France, and the Etrurian regent was kept entirely in the dark, only being informed that she would have to leave her young son&#x27;s kingdom on 23 November 1807. She and her court left on 10 December. On 30 May 1808, Etruria was formally annexed to France. An &quot;Extraordinary Giunta&quot; was placed in charge under General Jacques François Menou. Tuscany was divided into the &quot;départements&quot; of Arno, Méditerranée and Ombrone. In March 1809 a &quot;General Government of the Departments of Tuscany&quot; was set up, and Napoleon put his sister Elisa Bonaparte at its head, with the title of Grand Duchess of Tuscany.

===Tuscany restored and its absorption into unified Italy===

The Napoleonic system collapsed in 1814, and the following territorial settlement agreed to at the Congress of Vienna, ceded the State of Presidi and the Principality of Piombino to a restored Tuscany. Ferdinand III resumed his rule, and died in 1824. Italian nationalism exploded in the post-Napoleonic years, leading to the establishment of secret societies bent on a unified Italy. When these leagues arrived in Tuscany, a concerned Ferdinand requisitioned an Austrian garrison, from his brother Emperor Francis of Austria, for the defence of the state. Ferdinand aligned Tuscany with Austria.

Following Ferdinand&#x27;s death, his elder son, Leopold II, succeeded him. Leopold was contemporarily acknowledged as a liberal monarch. Despite his merits, most his subjects still dismissed him as a foreigner. His affinity for Austria was equally unpalatable. 

In 1847, in application of the 1844 secret , Leopold II annexed the Duchy of Lucca, a state created by the Congress of Vienna solely to accommodate the House of Bourbon-Parma until they could re-assume their Parmese sovereignty upon the death of the Duchess of Parma for life, Marie Louise of Austria. In October 1847, as she was still alive and reigning, the Duke of Lucca decided to prematurely abdicate his throne in favour of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, while the Lucca exclaves of Montignoso, Gallicano, Minucciano and Castiglione were given to the Duchy of Modena in accordance with the resolutions of the Congress of Vienna. Tuscany in turn ceded its Lunigiana domains either to Modena (Vicariate of Fivizzano), or to Parma (Vicariate of Pontremoli and other minor territories), retaining instead its ancient exclaves of Pietrasanta and Barga: the Congress had originally stipulated that they should be assigned to Modena, but, with the annexation of Lucca, they were no longer territorially separated from the rest of the Grand Duchy and loudly refused to be handed over to the unbeloved Modena House of Austria-Este. On taking possession of his new state, Leopold unexpectedly granted it the abolition of the death penalty, a measure whose effectiveness the supreme court of Florence hastened to extend to the entire territory of the Grand Duchy, at the beginning of 1848.
In Leopold&#x27;s years Italy was engulfed in popular rebellion, culminating in the Revolutions of 1848. The said revolution toppled the throne of France, and caused disarray across Europe. In Tuscany, Leopold II sanctioned a liberal constitution; and instituted a liberal ministry. Despite his attempts at acquiescence, street fighting in opposition to the regime sprang up in August, in Livorno. Leopold II lent his support to the Kingdom of Sardinia in the First Italian War of Independence. In February 1849, Leopold II had to abandon Tuscany to republicans and sought refuge in the Neapolitan city of Gaeta. A provisional republic was established in his stead. It was only with Austrian assistance that Leopold could return to Florence. The constitution was revoked in 1852, as was the abolition of capital punishment. The Austrian garrison was withdrawn in 1855.

The Second Italian War of Independence broke out in the summer of 1859. Leopold felt obliged to espouse Austria&#x27;s cause. The Royal Sardinian Army of Victor Emmanuel II captured Tuscany in its entirety, and held it for the duration of the conflict; Leopold fled Tuscany as a result. The Peace of Villafranca stipulated that Leopold be allowed to return, although in practise this never happened. He abdicated in favour of his elder son, Ferdinand. Ferdinand IV&#x27;s hypothetical reign did not last long; the House of Habsburg-Lorraine was formally deposed by the Tuscan National Assembly on 16 August 1859.

In December 1859, not before the provisional government had abolished the abhorred death penalty for the third time, the Grand Duchy was joined to the Duchies of Modena and Parma to form the United Provinces of Central Italy, which were annexed by the Kingdom of Sardinia a few months later. On 22 March 1860, after a referendum that voted overwhelmingly (95%) in favour of a union with Sardinia, Tuscany was formally annexed to Sardinia as part of the new Kingdom of Italy. Strongly attached to its ideal traditions, it remained the only region in Italy to maintain the abolition of capital punishment in force until 1889, when it was eventually extended to the whole Kingdom with the promulgation of the new Zanardelli penal code.

==Government==
Tuscany was divided into two main administrative districts: the &quot;stato nuovo&quot; (the new state) consisting of the former Republic of Siena, and the &quot;stato vecchio&quot; (the old state), the old Republic of Florence and her dependencies. The two areas were governed by separate laws. They were divided because the &quot;stato nuovo&quot; was a Spanish fief and the &quot;stato vecchio&quot; an Imperial one. Siena was ruled by a governor appointed by the grand duke. Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor proclaimed Alessandro de&#x27; Medici, Duke of Florence &quot;for his lifetime, and after his death to be succeeded by his sons, male heirs and successors, of his body, by order of primogeniture, and failing them by the closest male of the Medici family, and likewise in succession forever, by order of primogeniture.&quot;

Following the Republic&#x27;s surrender in the Siege of Florence, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor issued a proclamation explicitly stating that he and he alone could determine the government of Florence. On 12 August 1530, the Emperor created the Medici hereditary rulers (&quot;capo&quot;) of the &quot;Republic&quot; of Florence. Pope Clement VII willed his relative Alessandro de&#x27; Medici to be the monarchical ruler of Florence, and went about requisitioning that dignity carefully; he wanted to give the impression that the Florentines democratically chose Alessandro to be their monarch. In April 1532, the Pope convinced the &quot;Balía&quot;, Florence&#x27;s ruling commission, to draw up a new constitution. The document in question was officiated on the 27th of that month. It formally created a hereditary monarchy, abolished the age-old &quot;signoria&quot; (elective government) and the office of &quot;gonfaloniere&quot; (titular ruler of Florence elected for a two-month term); in their place was the &quot;consigliere&quot;, a four-man council elected for a three-month term, headed by the &quot;Duke of the Florentine Republic&quot; (and later the Grand Duke of Tuscany). The Senate, composed of forty-eight men, chosen by the constitutional reform commission, was vested with the prerogative of determining Florence&#x27;s financial, security, and foreign policies. Additionally, the senate appointed the commissions of war and public security, and the governors of Pisa, Arezzo, Prato, Voltera and Cortona and ambassadors. To be eligible, one had to be male and a noble. The Council of Two Hundred was a petitions court; membership was for life. This constitution was still in effect through the Medicean grand duchy, albeit the institutions were decayed and powerless by the rule of Ferdinando II.

Over time, the Medici acquired several territories, which included: the County of Pitigliano, purchased from the Orsini family in 1604; the County of Santa Fiora, acquired from the House of Sforza in 1633; Spain ceded Pontremoli in 1650, Silvia Piccolomini sold her estates, the Marquisate of Castiglione at the time of Cosimo I, Lordship of Pietra Santa, and the Duchy of Capistrano and the city of Penna in the Kingdom of Naples. Vittoria della Rovere brought the Duchies of Montefeltro and Rovere into the family in 1631, upon her death in 1694, they passed to her younger son, Francesco Maria de&#x27; Medici. They reverted to the crown with the ascension of Gian Gastone.

Gian Gastone, the last Medici, resigned the grand duchy to Francis Stephen of Lorraine. Under him, Tuscany was ruled by a viceroy, Marc de Beauvau-Craon, Prince de Craon. Francis Stephen altered the laws of succession in 1763, when he declared his second son, Leopold, heir to the grand duchy. If Leopold&#x27;s line were to become extinct, it would revert to the main line. Should Leopold or any of his direct successors somehow come into possession of the main domains of the Habsburg monarchy, the grand duchy would then pass on to their second son and the latter&#x27;s successors. Every grand duke after Leopold resided in Florence. Grand Duke Leopold II agreed to ratify a liberal constitution in 1848. He was briefly deposed by a provisional government in 1849, but restored to power the same year by Austrian troops. The government was finally dissolved upon its annexation to the United Provinces of Central Italy in 1859. The court moved to Salzburg and lived there in exile until 1918.

== Military ==

=== Army ===
In addition to its regular army, the duchy maintained a citizen-militia. This was used both for the protection of towns and fortresses that the army was not able to garrison, and as a reserve from which semi-trained men would be drawn into the army. The militia had its origins in 1498, in the predecessor state of the Florentine Republic. By 1506, it numbered 20,000 men, of whom 70% carried pikes, 20% halberds/bills and hog-spears, and 10% either arquebuses or crossbows. However, the size and quality of the duchy&#x27;s militia varied throughout its existence, as did its army.

From 1553 to 1559, Tuscany raised 30,000 troops for their participation in the Last Italian War, which saw the Republic of Siena being added to the duchy. For the decades thereafter, the grand dukes only maintained a peacetime force of 2,500 soldiers, 500 cavalry to patrol the coasts and 2,000 infantry to man castles (Cosimo I having significantly expanded Tuscany&#x27;s fortification network in an effort to defend the country). An anonymous Venetian intelligence report from the late 16th century stated that Tuscany could spend 800,000 ducats annually on war (half as much as the Spanish-held Kingdom of Naples despite having a quarter of its population), and could raise 40,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry, counting soldiers, militia, and mercenaries from nearby Corsica and Romagna, a force massively out of proportion to its population. Hanlon considers the report overly optimistic, but with some basis in fact.

In response to the Türkenkriege during the Long Turkish War starting in 1593, the Grand Duchy of Tuscany sent 100,000 scudi and 3,600 soldiers (3,000 infantry and 600 cavalry) to support the Holy Roman Emperor in Hungary, plus smaller detachments thereafter (there were 2,000 Tuscans in the Imperial army in Hungary by 1601). A Tuscan-Spanish treaty that bound the two at the end of the Italian Wars demanded that Tuscany send 5,000 troops to the Spanish army if ever the Duchy of Milan or Naples was attacked. In 1613, Cosimo II sent 2,000 infantry and 300 cavalry, along with an undisclosed number of Tuscan adventurers, to aid the Spanish after Savoy launched an invasion of the Duchy of Montferrat.

In 1631, the grand duke sent 7,000 troops (6,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry) to join Wallenstein&#x27;s army in support of the Emperor during the Thirty Years War. From 1629 to 1630 he also sent 6,000 troops to join the Spanish in the War of the Mantuan Succession, plus a naval detachment and funds to pay for 4,000 Swiss mercenaries. In 1643, during the Castro War, the Tuscan army was between 5,000 and 10,000 good troops, including foreign mercenaries but not including militia. Yves-Marie Berce figures that most of those troops were of French or Swiss origin, but Hanlon disputes this, saying that Italians comprised a larger portion, and that the specific origins of the troops have very little information to go on. He also cites the fact that many Italians served as mercenaries outside of Italy, though he admits that (other than the well-known mercenary tradition of Corsica) there is no information on their state origins. The duchy&#x27;s largest military deployment came during this war, when in June 1643 over 10,000 troops (7,000 Tuscans in eight regiments of infantry recruited from militia, garrison troops, and veteran mercenaries; 1 regiment of German infantry; 2,400 cavalry, a quarter of whom were Germans; and 1 regiment of Tuscan dragoons) with 18 cannons invaded the Papal States holding of Umbria, while other troops and militia were left garrisoning the grand duchy&#x27;s major citadels, coastal forts, and border forts. Militia were recruited into the army as needed to replace losses.

Tuscany&#x27;s economic and military strength cratered from the second half of the 17th century onward, which was reflected in the quality of its army; by 1740 it only consisted of a few thousand poorly-trained men and was considered impotent to such a degree that its Habsburgs rulers allowed enemy troops to cross the duchy unopposed.

=== Navy ===
The grand duchy had two sources of naval power: the state navy and the Order of Saint Stephen.

In 1572 the Tuscan navy consisted of 11 galleys, 2 galleasses, 2 galleons, 6 frigates, and various transports, carrying in all 200 guns, manned by 100 knights, 900 seamen, and 2,500 oarsmen. With the end of Spanish subsidies, in 1574 the navy shrunk to 4 galleys. Grand Duke Ferdinand I sought to expand Tuscany&#x27;s naval strength during his reign, and cooperated with the Order of Saint Stephen, which often blurred the line between itself and the Tuscan navy. The Order in 1604 counted among its fleet 6 galleys, 3 roundships/&quot;bertoni&quot;, 2 transports, 1 galleon, and 1 galleass, supplemented by other ships financed by corsairs flying the Tuscan banner. Ferdinand I expanded the Tuscan fleet after expanding the arsenal at Livorno, and oversaw many raids by both the navy and Order, including on Chios in 1599 (a failure), Preveza in 1605 (5 galleys with 400 Tuscan militia; a success), various Turkish ports in 1606 (6 galleys, some roundships, and 750 Tuscan soldiers; a success), and Bone in 1607 (8 galleys, 9 &quot;bertoni&quot;, and 1 galleon, with 2,300 soldiers; a success). From 1560 to 1609, the Tuscan fleet captured 76 galiots, 7 galleys, 2 large roundships, and 67 minor craft, taking 9,620 slaves and liberating 2,076 Christians. The preponderance of small vessels among the prizes indicates that most of the trophies were easy victories.

The Tuscans were early pioneers in the deployment of roundships, as technology made manpower-heavy galleys less efficient. They launched several big ships at Portoferraio after 1601, with an armament of 40 guns each yet only 60 seamen each. 8 of them around 1610 floated a total of 200 guns. They began to raid independently of the galleys on long voyages to the Levant. In 1608, they intercepted a Turkish convoy of 42 vessels off Rhodes, seizing 9 and netting 600 slaves and a booty of 1 million ducats, equivalent to two years of revenue for the whole grand duchy. Under Grand Duke Cosimo II, 7 roundships carrying 1,800 soldiers were sent to the Mediterranean from 1609 to 1611. This expedition was less successful, costing 800 men and 4 ships disabled. The grand duke also enticed English corsairs in North Africa to use Livorno as a base instead, in exchange for amnesty and a share of their profits; Livorno quickly became a corsair capital, with the corsairs preying on both Muslim and Christian shipping.

After 1612, the Tuscans progressively stopped sending out expeditions and limited their naval operations to patrols. This can be observed in the register of prizes of the Order of Saint Stephen. It lists some 238 vessels captured from 1563 to 1688; enemy galleys captured from 1568 to 1599 were 11 (for the loss of an identical number), and another 17 were seized between 1602 and 1635. Only 1 was captured after 1635. A notable incident in this time was a naval battle off Sardinia in October 1624, in which 15 Tuscan, Papal, and Neapolitan galleys converged on a flotilla of 5 Algerian pirate vessels (including a large flagship). In the 10-hour battle, punctuated by cannon fire and boarding actions, 600 pirates were killed or captured and they lost 4 of the 5 ships (3 sunk, 1 captured), while the Italians lost 60 dead.

In 1686, Tuscany sent 4 galleys, 4 galiots, and 2 other vessels carrying 870 soldiers to participate in the Morean War (a battalion of 400 Tuscans were already serving there). In 1687 the Tuscans sent an additional 4 galleys, plus 2 hired foreign galleys, carrying 860 more soldiers, including German mercenaries. In 1688, another 6 galleys and 860 soldiers joined the fray. All three contingents suffered high casualties, a third for the first two and over half for the third.

<doc id="679161" wikidata="Q1485806" url="?curid=679161" title="Pothole">
<text>A pothole is a pot-shaped depression in a road surface, usually asphalt pavement, where traffic has removed broken pieces of the pavement. It is usually the result of water in the underlying soil structure and traffic passing over the affected area. Water first weakens the underlying soil; traffic then fatigues and breaks the poorly supported asphalt surface in the affected area. Continued traffic action ejects both asphalt and the underlying soil material to create a hole in the pavement.

== Formation ==

According to the US Army Corps of Engineers&#x27;s Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory, pothole formation requires two factors to be present at the same time: water and traffic. Water weakens the soil beneath the pavement while traffic applies the loads that stress the pavement past the breaking point. Potholes form progressively from fatigue of the road surface which can lead to a precursor failure pattern known as crocodile (or alligator) cracking. Eventually, chunks of pavement between the fatigue cracks gradually work loose, and may then be plucked or forced out of the surface by continued wheel loads to create a pothole.

In areas subject to freezing and thawing, frost heaving can damage a pavement and create openings for water to enter. In the spring, thaw of pavements accelerates this process when the thawing of upper portions of the soil structure in a pavement cannot drain past still-frozen lower layers, thus saturating the supporting soil and weakening it.

Potholes can grow to several feet in width, though they usually only develop to depths of a few inches. If they become large enough, damage to tires, wheels, and vehicle suspensions is liable to occur. Serious road accidents can occur as a direct result, especially on those roads where vehicle speeds are greater.

Potholes may result from four main causes:
# Insufficient pavement thickness to support traffic during freeze/thaw periods without localized failures
# Insufficient drainage
# Failures at utility trenches and castings (manhole and drain casings)
# Pavement defects and cracks left unmaintained and unsealed so as to admit moisture and compromise the structural integrity of the pavement

==Gallery==
==Prevention==
The following steps can be taken to avoid pothole formation in existing pavements:
:1. Surveying of pavements for risk factors
:2. Providing adequate drainage structures
:3. Preventive maintenance
:4. Utility cut management
:5. Sealing asphalt cracks

===Survey of pavements===
At-risk pavement are more often local roads with lower structural standards and more complicating factors, like underground utilities, than major arteries. Pavement condition monitoring can lead to timely preventive action. Surveys address pavement distresses, which both diminishes the strength of the asphalt layer and admits water into the pavement, and effective drainage of water from within and around the pavement structure.

===Drainage===
Drainage structures, including ditching and storm sewers are essential for removing water from pavements. Avoiding other risk factors with good construction includes well-draining base and sub-base soils that avoid frost action and promote drying of the soil structure. Adequate crowns promote drainage to the sides. Good crack control prevents water penetration into the pavement soil structure.

===Preventive maintenance===
Preventive maintenance adds maintaining pavement structural integrity with thickness and continuity to the mix of preventing water penetration and promoting water migration away from the roadway.

===Utility cut management===
Eaton, et al., advocate a permitting process for utility cuts with specifications that avoid loss of structural continuity of pavements and flaws or failures that allow water penetration.

Some municipalities require contractors to install utility repair tags to identify responsible parties of the deteriorated patches.

=== Sealing asphalt cracks ===
A US Air Force manual advocates semiannual inspection of pavement cracks with crack sealing commencing on cracks that exceed 

==Repair==
Pothole patching methods may be either temporary or semi-permanent. Temporary patching is reserved for weather conditions that are not favorable to a more permanent solution and usually uses a cold mix asphalt patching compound placed in an expedient manner to temporarily restore pavement smoothness. Semi-permanent patching uses more care in reconstructing the perimeter of the failed area to blend with the surrounding pavement and usually employs a hot-mix asphalt fill above replacement of appropriate base materials.

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) offers an overview of best practices which includes several repair techniques; throw-and-roll, semi-permanent, spray injection, and edge seal. The FHWA suggests the best patching techniques, at times other than winter, are spray injection, throw-and-roll, semi-permanent, or edge seal procedures. In winter, the throw-and-roll technique may be the only available option. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in South Africa offers similar methods for the repair of potholes.

===Materials===
Asphaltic patch materials consist of a binder and aggregate that come in two broad categories, hot mix and cold mix. Hot mixes are used by some agencies, they are produced at local asphalt plants. The FHWA manual cites three types of cold mixes, those produced by a local asphalt plant, either 1) using the available aggregate and binder or 2) according to specifications set by the agency that will use the mix. The third type is a proprietary cold mix, which is manufactured to an advertised standard.

===Throw-and-roll repair===
The FHWA manual cites the throw-and-roll method as the most basic method, best used as a temporary repair under conditions when it is difficult to control the placement of material, such as winter-time. It consists of:

# Placing the hot or cold patch material into a pothole
# Compacting the patch with a vehicle, such as a truck
# Achieving a crown on the compacted patch of between 3 and 6 mm

This method is widely used due to its simplicity and speed, especially as an expedient method when the material is placed under unfavorable conditions of water or temperature. It can also be employed at times when the pothole is dry and clean with more lasting results. Eaton, et al., noted that the failure rate of expedient repairs is high and that they can cost as much as five times the cost of properly done repairs. They advocate this type of repair only when weather conditions prevent proper techniques.

Researchers from the University of Minnesota Duluth have tested mixing asphalt with iron ore containing magnetite which is then heated using ferromagnetic resonance (using microwaves at a specific frequency) to heat the mixed asphalt. The mixture used a compound of between 1% and 2% magnetite. The group discovered that material could be heated for a patch to in approximately ten minutes which then applied a more effective repair and drove out moisture which improved adhesion.

===Semi-permanent repair===
The FHWA manual cites the semi-permanent repair method as one of the best for repairing potholes, short of full-depth roadway replacement. It consists of:
:1. Removing water and debris from the pothole
:2. Making clean cuts along the sides of prospective patch area to assure that vertical sides of the repair are in sound pavement (Eaton, et al., recommend a bituminous tack coat in the open cavity, prior to placement of patch material.)
:3. Placing the hot or cold patch mix material
:4. Compacting the patch with a device that is smaller than the patch area, e.g. vibratory rollers or a vibratory plate
While this repair procedure provides durable results, it requires more labor and is more equipment-intensive than the throw-and-roll or the spray-injection procedure.

===Spray-injection repair===
The FHWA manual cites the spray-injection procedure as an efficient alternative to semi-permanent repair. It requires specialized equipment, however. It consists of:
:1. Blowing water and debris from the pothole
:2. Spraying a tack coat of binder on the sides and bottom of the pothole
:3. Blowing asphalt and aggregate into the pothole
:4. Covering the patched area with a layer of aggregate
This procedure requires no compaction after the cover aggregate has been placed.

===Edge seal repair===
The FHWA manual cites the edge seal method as an alternative to the above techniques. It consists of:
:1. Following the &quot;throw-and-roll&quot; steps
:2. After the repaired section has dried, placing a ribbon of asphaltic tack material on top of the patch edge, overlapping the pavement and the patch
:3. Placing sand on the tack material to prevent tracking by vehicle tires
In this procedure, waiting for any water to dry may require a second visit to place the tack coat. The tack material prevents water from getting through the edge of the patch and helps bond the patch to the surrounding pavement.

===Efficacy of repair methods===
An FHWA-sponsored study determined that the &quot;throw-and-roll technique proved as effective as the semi-permanent procedure when the two procedures were compared directly, using similar materials&quot;. It also found the throw-and-roll procedure to be generally more cost-effective when using quality materials. It further found that spray-injection repairs were as effective as control patches, depending on the expertise of the equipment operator.

== Costs to the public ==
The American Automobile Association estimated in the five years prior to 2016 that 16 million drivers in the United States have suffered damage from potholes to their vehicle including tire punctures, bent wheels, and damaged suspensions with a cost of $3 billion a year. In India, between 2015 and 2017, an average of 3,000 people per year were killed in accidents involving potholes. Britain has estimated that the cost of fixing all roads with potholes in the country would cost £12 billion. 255 cyclists in Britain were killed or seriously injured because of road defects between 2017 and 2023.

== Reporting ==
Some jurisdictions offer websites or mobile apps for pothole-reporting. These allow citizens to report potholes and other road hazards, optionally including a photograph and GPS coordinates. It is estimated there are 55 million potholes in the United States. The self-proclaimed pothole capital, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada reportedly spends $4.8 million on 450,000 potholes annually, as of 2015.

India has historically lost over 3,000 people per year to accidents caused by potholes. This situation has engendered citizen movement to address the problem.

In the United Kingdom, more than half a million pot holes were reported in 2017, an increase of 44% on the 2015 figure. There are processes in place to report potholes at different levels of jurisdiction. The process for claiming compensation varies by jurisdiction.

== In popular culture ==
Potholes have been commented on both in various media.

===Visual art===
Two artists, Jim Bachor of Chicago and Baadal Nanjundaswamy of Bangalore, India, have used artwork as a commentary on potholes by placing mosaics (depicting ice cream in various manifestations) or sculpture (in the form of a crocodile) in potholes. Elsewhere, activists in Russia used painted caricatures of local officials with their mouths as potholes, to show their anger about the poor state of the roads. In Manchester, England, a graffiti artist painted images of penises around potholes, which often resulted in them being repaired within 48 hours.

===Song===
The Beatles song &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; references potholes. John Lennon wrote the song&#x27;s final verse inspired by a &quot;Far &amp; Near&quot; news brief, in the same 17 January edition of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; that had inspired the first two verses. Under the headline &quot;The holes in our roads&quot;, the brief stated: &quot;There are 4,000 holes in the road in Blackburn, Lancashire, or one twenty-sixth of a hole per person, according to a council survey. If Blackburn is typical, there are two million holes in Britain&#x27;s roads and 300,000 in London.&quot;

===Television===
In the Seinfeld episode The Pothole, George discovers that he has lost his keys, including a commemorative Phil Rizzuto keychain that says &quot;Holy Cow&quot; when activated. He then retraces his steps, and returns to a street where he had jumped over a pothole, which is now filled in with asphalt. The &quot;Holy Cow&quot; phrase is heard when a car runs over it.

<doc id="679164" wikidata="Q183277" url="?curid=679164" title="British Columbia Highway 95">
<text>Highway 95 is a north-south highway in the southeastern corner of British Columbia, opened in 1957. The highway connects with U.S. Route 95, from which the highway takes its number, at the Canada–U.S. border at Kingsgate, just north of Eastport, Idaho. The section between the Canada-U.S. border and the Crowsnest Highway is known as the Yahk–Kingsgate Highway while the section between the Crowsnest Highway and Golden is known as the Kootenay–Columbia Highway.

Highway 95, one of the most overlapped highways in the province, shares most of its route with other numbered highways.

==Route description==

The long Highway 95 begins at the international border in a small community called Kingsgate. It connects to U.S. Route 95 at the Eastport-Kingsgate Border Crossing. Heading north from there, it follows the Moyie River northeast for to the town of Yahk, where it merges onto the Crowsnest Highway (Highway 3). Highway 95 follows the Crowsnest Highway northeast for to the city of Cranbrook, where Highway 95A, designated in 1968 and following the original alignment of Highway 95 for through Kimberley and Ta Ta Creek, begins. From Cranbrook, it is another east to the Fort Steele junction, where Highway 3 hands Highway 95 off to Highway 93.

From the Fort Steele junction, Highway 95 follows Highway 93 north for through the community of Wasa, to where Highway 95A&#x27;s east junction is located. From the Highway 95A junction, Highway 93/95 follows the Kootenay River upstream for , through Skookumchuck to the town of Canal Flats, at the southern end of Columbia Lake. North of Canal Flats, Highway 93/95 travels for along the Columbia River, through the communities of Fairmont Hot Springs, Windermere and Invermere to the town of Radium Hot Springs, where Highway 93 diverges east. Highway 95 continues to follow the Columbia River north for , through the locations of Edgewater, Brisco, Spillimacheen and Parson, to where it terminates at its junction with the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1) at Golden.

==History==
Prior to 1941, British Columbia used lettered routes as opposed to numbers, and the Kootenay–Columbia Highway between Cranbrook and Golden was designated as part of &quot;Route U&quot;, which continued south to U.S. Route 93 at Roosville along present-day Highway 93. In 1941, British Columbia introduced numbered highways, with Highway 95 begin designated on Yahk–Kingsgate Highway, the northern extension of U.S. Route 95, while the Kootenay–Columbia Highway between Cranbrook and Golden was designated as Highway 4. In 1953, the Highway 4 was moved to its present location on Vancouver Island, with the Kootenay–Columbia Highway being renumbered to Highway 95. In 1968, A shorter alignment opened bypassing the Kimberley route via Ft Steele and Wasa. Immediately after opening the bypass was numbered Highway 93 with the Highway through Kimberley continuing to be numbered 95 for a few years until the completion of the &quot;freeway style&quot; interchange at Eager Hill when the bypass became 93/95 with the Kimberly alignment becoming Highway 95A in order to discourage through traffic from unnecessarily passing through Kimberly.

<text>The brown-throated wattle-eye (Platysteira cyanea), also known as the common wattle-eye or scarlet-spectacled wattle-eye, is a small, insectivorous passerine bird. The wattle-eyes were previously classed as a subfamily of the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae, but are now usually separated from that group.

This species breeds in west, central and northeast tropical Africa. This common species is found in secondary forest and other woodland areas, including gardens. The eggs are laid in a small neat lichen and cobweb cup low in a tree or bush.

The adult brown-throated wattle-eye is a stout bird about long. The breeding male has glossy black upperparts, and white underparts with a neat black breast band. There is a strong white wingbar, and fleshy red wattles above the eye.

The females are grey-black above, and also have the white wing bar and red wattles. There is a small patch of white below the bill, and the throat and breast are maroon, separated from the white belly by the black breast band. Young males are washed-out, greyer versions of the female.

These active insect-eating birds are found in pairs or small groups. The ringing call of the brown-throated wattle-eye is a very characteristic six note &quot;.&quot;

<doc id="679169" wikidata="Q1144855" url="?curid=679169" title="Matsushima">
<text>is a group of islands in Miyagi Prefecture, Japan. There are some 260 tiny islands (&quot;shima&quot;) covered in pines (&quot;matsu&quot;) – hence the name – and it is considered to be one of the Three Views of Japan.

Nearby cultural properties include Zuigan-ji, Entsū-in, Kanrantei, and the Satohama shell mound.

==Views==

A well-known haiku describes the islands as so striking that the poet is at a loss for words:

While often attributed to Matsuo Bashō, the earliest known publication is in the &quot;Matsushima Zushi&quot; (松島図誌), published in 1820 over a century after Bashō&#x27;s death, which attributes it to the &quot;kyōka&quot; poet Tawara-bō (田原坊). While Bashō did visit Matsushima in &quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot;, its only haiku about Matsushima was written by his travel comparison Kawai Sora.

===Four views of Matsushima===
There are four well-known spots to view the Matsushima, known as the , , , and .

===Cruise===
Tourists can view the islands from up close on cruise boats.

==Transportation==

The town is only a short distance (thirty minutes, about 14 km) from prefectural capital Sendai and is easily accessible by train. Matsushima-Kaigan Station is near the attractions such as Zuiganji and the waterfront. Matsushima Station, on a separate line is on the opposite side of the town.

==2011 Tōhoku earthquake==
Despite the proximity of Matsushima to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, the area was protected by the islands and suffered relatively little damage. The initial tsunami was 3.2 metres (10.5 feet) with the second 3.8 metres (12.5 feet). Electricity was restored by March 18, water fully restored by April 16th and the Senseki Train Line between Takagimachi Station and Sendai by May 28. Nevertheless, three people were confirmed killed in Matsushima (including by aftershocks) with 18 killed while out of town.

== Activities ==
Around the island travelers can go on a cruise and view the islands up close, and around the Matsushima shore travelers can rent bikes.

<doc id="679171" wikidata="Q7589042" url="?curid=679171" title="St. Jones River">
<text>The St. Jones River is a river flowing to Delaware Bay in central Delaware in the United States. It is long and drains an area of on the Atlantic Coastal Plain.

==History==
The river is believed to have been named either for Robert Jones, an early European property owner in the region, or for &quot;St. Jone&quot;, adapted from a Welsh spelling from St. John ().

==Course==
The St. Jones River flows for its entire length in east-central Kent County. According to the Geographic Names Information System, the river begins at the dam of Silver Lake in the city of Dover; Silver Lake is fed by Fork Branch, Penrose Branch, and Maidstone Branch. From Silver Lake, the St. Jones River flows generally southeastwardly, along the east side of downtown Dover and past Legislative Hall, the Capital Square/Legislative Mall, and the Dover Air Force Base to Bowers, where it flows into Delaware Bay, approximately north of the mouth of the Murderkill River.

==Watershed==
The lower course of the river southeast of Dover is surrounded by brackish marshes and salt marshes, open water habitats, and wetlands. A portion of the lower river, along with nearby Blackbird Creek, have received federal protection as the Delaware National Estuarine Research Reserve, part of the National Estuarine Research Reserve system.

==Variant names==
The United States Board on Geographic Names settled on &quot;St. Jones River&quot; as the stream&#x27;s name in 1894. According to the Geographic Names Information System, it has also been known historically as:
*Jones Creek 
*Joness Creek 
*Kishlen 
*Saint Jones Creek 
*Warge Kijhlen 
*Wulfs Creek 
*Wulfscreek

<text>Joseph (&quot;Joe&quot;) Nathaniel DeLoach (born June 5, 1967) is an American former sprinter who was the 1988 Olympic champion in the 200 m.

Born in Bay City, Texas into a family with 11 sisters and one brother, DeLoach enjoyed running at a young age and desired to become a football player, but later set his mind to sprinting. He trained at the University of Houston, like Carl Lewis before him.

During his career, DeLoach took part in one Olympiad, the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. He won the 200 m (beating his teammate from the Santa Monica Track Club, Carl Lewis, while placing fifth in the 100 m). The first performance was enough to qualify for the Games. There, he and Lewis were the favorites. In the final, DeLoach caught Lewis and finished in the Olympic record time of 19.75 s. This performance marked the only time Carl Lewis was defeated in an individual Olympic final and as of 10 September 2024 it remains the track record for Seoul.

In 2003, Dr. Wade Exum, the United States Olympic Committee&#x27;s director of drug control administration from 1991 to 2000, gave copies of documents to &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; which revealed that some 100 American athletes, including DeLoach, had tested positive for drugs between 1988 and 2000. The IAAF investigated the allegations, and announced that the dosages were in low concentration and no rules had been broken.

<doc id="679183" wikidata="Q1076688" url="?curid=679183" title="Benelli M4">
<text>The Benelli M4 is a semi-automatic shotgun produced by Italian firearm manufacturer Benelli Armi SpA, and the fourth and last model of the Benelli Super 90 line of semi-automatic shotguns. The M4 uses a proprietary action design called the &quot;auto-regulating gas-operated&quot; (ARGO) system, which was created specifically for the weapon. Designed in 1998, the M4 was adopted by the armed forces of Italy, the United States, and United Kingdom, among others, and has been used in a variety of conflicts.

==History==
On May 4, 1998, the United States Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) at Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey issued Solicitation #DAAE30-98-R-0401 requesting submissions for a new 12 gauge semi-automatic combat shotgun for the U.S. military. In response to the request, Benelli Armi SpA of Urbino, Italy designed and built the Benelli M4 Super 90 Combat Shotgun. On August 4, 1998, five samples of the M4 were delivered to Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, and after intense testing, the M4 won the competition. In early 1999, ARDEC awarded the M1014 Joint Service Combat Shotgun contract to Heckler &amp; Koch, U.S. subsidiary for importation of the Benelli M4 Combat Shotgun. The first 20,000 units were delivered to the United States Marine Corps in 1999. During testing, the prototype was named &quot;XM1014&quot;; , per U.S. military standards; after adoption, the &quot;X&quot; was dropped, and the weapon was officially designated the &quot;M1014&quot;.

==Design==

The M4 was the first gas-operated shotgun produced by Benelli. Its function is designed around an entirely new design called the &quot;auto-regulating gas-operated&quot; (ARGO) system. The short-stroke design uses two self-cleaning stainless steel pistons located just ahead of the chamber to function opposite a rotating bolt, thereby eliminating the need for the complex mechanisms found on other gas-actuated automatics. The ARGO incorporates only four parts: two symmetrical fore-end shrouds containing two small steel pistons that push directly against the bolt.

Additionally, the weapon is self-regulating for use with shotshells of varying lengths and power levels. It can fire and shells of differing propellant loads without any operator adjustments and in any combination. Low-power rounds, such as less-lethal baton rounds, must be cycled manually.

The sights are military-style ghost ring and are adjustable in the field using only the rim of a shell. The MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail on top of the receiver allows use of both conventional optical sights and night-vision devices, while retaining use of the original iron sights.

The modular basis of the shotgun means many of its features can be reconfigured as needed. It allows a user to quickly exchange the various assembly groups (barrel, buttstock, forend, etc.) without the use of additional tools.

===Durability===
Preliminary testing of the M4 suggests a high level of reliability. It can reliably function for at least 25,000 rounds without replacement of any major parts. The steel components of the weapon feature a matte black phosphated corrosion resistant finish while the aluminium parts are matte hard-anodized. These finishes reduce the weapon&#x27;s visibility during night operations.

The weapon requires little maintenance and operates in all climates and weather conditions.

===Collapsible buttstock===
The buttstock is collapsible on the M4 Model (designated 11707) and on the M1014. Collapsing the buttstock shortens the weapon by almost , allowing easier storage and transportation; furthermore, it permits better maneuverability around tight corners and over obstacles. The M4 is also available with both pistol grip and semi-grip fixed stocks, with these also being available for the M1014.

===Rail interface system===
The Picatinny rail built into the top of the shotgun accepts scopes, laser illuminators, night-vision sights and flashlights. Most modern military firearms have similar structures. There are aftermarket accessories such as handguards that incorporate other rail interface systems such as M-LOK.

===Benelli Tactical and the M4===
Benelli Tactical is a division of Beretta&#x27;s Law Enforcement (LE) division. Benelli Tactical manages the sales of all tactical shotguns to law enforcement agencies, government and military entities. The M4 shotgun is sold in three configurations: M4 Entry with a barrel; M4 with an barrel; and M1014, which is an M4 with the &quot;M1014&quot; nomenclature on it for military usage only. M4 shotguns sold through Benelli Tactical are available with the collapsible buttstock.

Benelli Tactical and Beretta LE have maintained the belief that the collapsible stock, while no longer illegal in the United States, is still only to be made available to law enforcement and government agencies, and thus does not sell them to private individuals; however, Benelli Tactical sells the stock piece for retrofitting the pistol grip stock, which can be shipped from Italy without restrictions.

Suggested retail price of the civilian version is around $1,899. An NFA stamp is required to purchase or own the 14.5&quot; barreled model only since this model is considered to be a Short Barreled Shotgun or SBS. Standard magazine capacity of the civilian version is 5+1, although it is possible to fit 6+1 and two shot extension tubes are sold by Benelli as well as some other companies. Also available are 9 + 1 extension tubes, which popular in 3-gun competitions. Some LE models have become available to private individuals on the secondary market.

<doc id="679186" wikidata="Q3775789" url="?curid=679186" title="Stefan problem">
<text>In mathematics and its applications, particularly to phase transitions in matter, a Stefan problem is a particular kind of boundary value problem for a system of partial differential equations (PDE), in which the boundary between the phases can move with time. The classical Stefan problem aims to describe the evolution of the boundary between two phases of a material undergoing a phase change, for example the melting of a solid, such as ice to water. This is accomplished by solving heat equations in both regions, subject to given boundary and initial conditions. At the interface between the phases (in the classical problem) the temperature is set to the phase change temperature. To close the mathematical system a further equation, the Stefan condition, is required. This is an energy balance which defines the position of the moving interface. Note that this evolving boundary is an unknown (hyper-)surface; hence, Stefan problems are examples of free boundary problems.

Analogous problems occur, for example, in the study of porous media flow, mathematical finance and crystal growth from monomer solutions.

== Historical note ==
The problem is named after Josef Stefan (Jožef Stefan), the Slovenian physicist who introduced the general class of such problems around 1890 in a series of four papers concerning the freezing of the ground and the formation of sea ice. However, some 60 years earlier, in 1831, an equivalent problem, concerning the formation of the Earth&#x27;s crust, had been studied by Lamé and Clapeyron. Stefan&#x27;s problem admits a similarity solution, this is often termed the Neumann solution, which was allegedly presented in a series of lectures in the early 1860s.

A comprehensive description of the history of Stefan problems may be found in Rubinstein.

== Premises to the mathematical description ==

From a mathematical point of view, the phases are merely regions in which the solutions of the underlying PDE are continuous and differentiable up to the order of the PDE. In physical problems such solutions represent properties of the medium for each phase. The moving boundaries (or interfaces) are infinitesimally thin surfaces that separate adjacent phases; therefore, the solutions of the underlying PDE and its derivatives may suffer discontinuities across interfaces.

The underlying PDEs are not valid at the phase change interfaces; therefore, an additional condition—the Stefan condition—is needed to obtain closure. The Stefan condition expresses the local velocity of a moving boundary, as a function of quantities evaluated at either side of the phase boundary, and is usually derived from a physical constraint. In problems of heat transfer with phase change, for instance, conservation of energy dictates that the discontinuity of heat flux at the boundary must be accounted for by the rate of latent heat release (which is proportional to the local velocity of the interface).

The regularity of the equation has been studied mainly by Luis Caffarelli and further refined by work of Alessio Figalli, Xavier Ros-Oton and Joaquim Serra

== Mathematical formulation ==

=== The one-dimensional one-phase Stefan problem ===
The one-phase Stefan problem is based on an assumption that one of the material phases may be neglected. Typically this is achieved by assuming that a phase is at the phase change temperature and hence any variation from this leads to a change of phase. This is a mathematically convenient approximation, which simplifies analysis whilst still demonstrating the essential ideas behind the process. A further standard simplification is to work in non-dimensional format, such that the temperature at the interface may be set to zero and far-field values to formula_1 or formula_2.

Consider a semi-infinite one-dimensional block of ice initially at melting temperature formula_3 for formula_4. The most well-known form of Stefan problem involves melting via an imposed constant temperature at the left hand boundary, leaving a region formula_5 occupied by water. The melted depth, denoted by formula_6, is an unknown function of time. The Stefan problem is defined by 
:* The heat equation: formula_7
:* A fixed temperature, above the melt temperature, on the left boundary: formula_8
:* The interface at the melting temperature is set to formula_9
:* The Stefan condition: formula_10 where formula_11 is the Stefan number, the ratio of latent to &quot;specific&quot; sensible heat (where specific indicates it is divided by the mass). Note this definition follows naturally from the nondimensionalisation and is used in many texts however it may also be defined as the inverse of this.
:* The initial temperature distribution: formula_12
:* The initial depth of the melted ice block: formula_13
:The Neumann solution, obtained by using self-similar variables, indicates that the position of the boundary is given by formula_14 where formula_15 satisfies the transcendental equation formula_16 The temperature in the liquid is then given by formula_17

==Applications==
Apart from modelling melting of solids, Stefan problem is also used as a model for the asymptotic behaviour (in time) of more complex problems. For example, Pego uses matched asymptotic expansions to prove that Cahn-Hilliard solutions for phase separation problems behave as solutions to a non-linear Stefan problem at an intermediate time scale. Additionally, the solution of the Cahn–Hilliard equation for a binary mixture is reasonably comparable with the solution of a Stefan problem. In this comparison, the Stefan problem was solved using a front-tracking, moving-mesh method with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions at the outer boundary. Also, Stefan problems can be applied to describe phase transformations other than solid-fluid or fluid-fluid.

Application of Stefan problem to metal crystallization in electrochemical deposition of metal powders was envisaged by Călușaru 

The Stefan problem also has a rich inverse theory; in such problems, the melting depth (or curve or hyper-surface) is the known datum and the problem is to find or .

== Advanced forms of Stefan problem ==
The classical Stefan problem deals with stationary materials with constant thermophysical properties (usually irrespective of phase), a constant phase change temperature and, in the example above, an instantaneous switch from the initial temperature to a distinct value at the boundary. In practice thermal properties may vary and specifically always do when the phase changes. The jump in density at phase change induces a fluid motion: the resultant kinetic energy does not figure in the standard energy balance. With an instantaneous temperature switch the initial fluid velocity is infinite, resulting in an initial infinite kinetic energy. In fact the liquid layer is often in motion, thus requiring advection or convection terms in the heat equation. The melt temperature may vary with size, curvature or speed of the interface. It is impossible to instantaneously switch temperatures and then difficult to maintain an exact fixed boundary temperature. Further, at the nanoscale the temperature may not even follow Fourier&#x27;s law.

A number of these issues have been tackled in recent years for a variety of physical applications. In the solidification of supercooled melts an analysis where the phase change temperature depends on the interface velocity may be found in Font &quot;et al&quot;. Nanoscale solidification, with variable phase change temperature and energy/density effects are modelled in. Solidification with flow in a channel has been studied, in the context of lava and microchannels, or with a free surface in the context of water freezing over an ice layer. A general model including different properties in each phase, variable phase change temperature and heat equations based on either Fourier&#x27;s law or the Guyer-Krumhansl equation is analysed in.

<doc id="679192" wikidata="Q913366" url="?curid=679192" title="Superior oblique muscle">
<text>The superior oblique muscle or obliquus oculi superior is a fusiform muscle originating in the upper, medial side of the orbit (i.e. from beside the nose) which abducts, depresses and internally rotates the eye. It is the only extraocular muscle innervated by the trochlear nerve (the fourth cranial nerve).

==Structure==

The superior oblique muscle loops through a pulley-like structure (the trochlea of superior oblique) and inserts into the sclera on the posterotemporal surface of the eyeball. It is the pulley system that gives superior oblique its actions, causing depression of the eyeball despite being inserted on the superior surface.

The superior oblique arises immediately above the margin of the optic foramen, superior and medial to the origin of the superior rectus, and, passing forward, ends in a rounded tendon, which plays in a fibrocartilaginous ring or pulley attached to the trochlear fossa of the frontal bone.

The contiguous surfaces of the tendon and ring are lined by a delicate mucous sheath, and enclosed in a thin fibrous investment.

The tendon is reflected caudally, laterally, and inferiorly beneath the superior rectus to the lateral part of the bulb of the eye, and is inserted onto the scleral surface, behind the equator of the eyeball, the insertion of the muscle lying between the superior rectus and lateral rectus.

==Function==

The primary (main) action of the superior oblique muscle is intorsion (internal rotation), the secondary action is depression (primarily in the adducted position) and the tertiary action is abduction (lateral rotation).

The extraocular muscles rotate the eyeball around vertical, horizontal and antero-posterior axes. Extraocular muscles other than the medial rectus and lateral rectus have more than one action due to the angle they make with the optical axis of the eye while inserting into the eyeball. The superior and inferior oblique muscles make an angle of 51 degrees with the optical axis.

The depressing action of superior oblique (making the eye look down towards the mouth) is most effective when the eye is in an adducted position. This is because as the eye is abducted (looks laterally), the contribution made by superior oblique to depression of the eye decreases, as the inferior rectus muscle causes this movement more directly and powerfully. The main muscle for abduction is the lateral rectus, so although superior oblique contributes to a downwards and lateral eye movement, testing this motion would not be specific enough as inferior and lateral recti muscles would also be tested. Therefore, during neurological examinations, the superior oblique is tested by having the patient look inwards and downwards, testing only the depressing action of the muscle. This is a source of confusion on the subject as although clinical testing asks the patient to adduct and depress the eye, anatomically the muscle depresses and abducts it.

The great importance of intorsion and extorsion produced by the two oblique muscles can only be understood when it is considered with regards to the other muscle actions present. The two obliques prevent the eye from rotating about its long axis (retina to pupil) when the superior and inferior rectus muscles contract. This is because the orbit does not face directly forwards- the centre-line of the orbit is a little over 20 degrees out from the mid-line. But because the eyes do face forwards, when acting alone, as well as making the eye look up, superior rectus causes it to rotate slightly about the long axis, so the top of the eye moves medially (intorsion). Similarly, in addition to making the eye look down, inferior rectus would cause the eye to rotate about the long axis so the top of the eye moves slightly laterally (extorsion), if acting alone. Clearly this is undesirable as our vision would rotate when we looked up and down. For this reason, these two rectus muscles work in conjunction with the two obliques. When acting alone, superior oblique causes intorsion, inferior oblique, extorsion. Hence, when inferior rectus contracts so we look down, superior oblique also contracts to prevent extorsion of the eye, and when superior rectus contracts so we look up, inferior oblique contracts to prevent intorsion, thus the undesired rotatory actions of the inferior and superior recti about the long axis of the eye are cancelled out. This keeps our vision horizontally level, irrespective of eye position in the orbit.

==Clinical significance==
Superior oblique palsy is a common complication of closed head trauma. Restriction of superior oblique relaxation movement due to an inelastic tendon is found in Brown syndrome, leading to difficulty elevating the eye in the adducted position.

Superior oblique myokymia is an uncommon neurological condition caused by vascular compression of the trochlear nerve resulting in repeated, brief, involuntary episodes of movement of the eye.

Surgical operations of the superior oblique include tenotomy, recession, silicone expander lengthening, split tendon lengthening, tucking, and the Harada-Ito procedure.

<text>In modern fencing, a lamé is an electrically conductive jacket worn by foil and sabre fencers in order to define the scoring area and register contact with it. Lamés are wired by use of a body cord to a scoring machine, which allows the other person&#x27;s weapon to register touches when their tips (or blades, in sabre) contact the lamé.

Lamés generally consist of a polyester jacket overlain with a thin, interwoven metal, usually steel or copper. This gives the lamés a metallic, gray appearance, but colored foil lamés have become increasingly popular. Lamés used in higher-level competitions usually have the last name and country of their owner printed in blue across the back. 

Because the scoring area is different for each weapon, the lamé may cover more or less of the body depending on which weapon the fencer uses. In foil, the lamé extends on the torso from the shoulders to the groin area, including the back. In sabre, the lamé covers both arms, the torso from the shoulders to the waist, and the back. In addition, sabre fencers wear masks that allow them to register head touches, and &quot;manchettes&quot;, which are conductive glove covers, on their weapon hand. A lamé is not required in épée, since the target in épée is the whole body.

All eight regional chambers had adopted the title &quot;regional assembly&quot; or &quot;assembly&quot; as part of their name, though this was not an official status in law. The chambers were abolished over a two-year period between 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2010 and some of their functions were assumed by newly established local authority leaders&#x27; boards.

Greater London has a directly elected London Assembly, which was established by separate legislation and is part of the Greater London Authority.

== Role ==

Their original defined role was to channel regional opinions to the business-led regional development agencies. Their role later included scrutinising their regional development agency; integrating policy development and enhancing partnership working at the regional level across the social, economic and environmental policy agenda; as well as carrying out a wide range of advocacy and consultancy roles with UK government bodies and the European Union; but their public profile was low. Each acted as a regional planning body with a duty to formulate a regional spatial strategy including regional transport strategy, replacing the planning function of county councils.

The English Regions Network (ERN) was the umbrella organisation for England&#x27;s eight partnership regional chambers. While the London Assembly worked with ERN on some issues it was not a full member of the Network.

== Membership ==
The eight regional chambers as defined by the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998 were not directly elected. About two-thirds of assembly members were appointees from the county and district councils and unitary authorities in each region, the remaining one-third were appointees from other regional interest groups.

The London Assembly is part of a wider Greater London Authority and has 25 directly elected members. Its role is defined in the Greater London Authority Act 1999.

== The regional chambers ==

There was some inconsistency in the naming of the individual assemblies. Each chamber adopted either &quot;regional assembly&quot; or &quot;assembly&quot;:
* East of England Regional Assembly (abolished March 2010)
* East Midlands Regional Assembly (abolished March 2010)
* North East Assembly (abolished March 2009)
* North West Regional Assembly (abolished June 2008)
* South East England Regional Assembly (abolished March 2009)
* South West Regional Assembly (abolished May 2009)
* West Midlands Regional Assembly (abolished March 2010)
* Yorkshire and Humber Assembly (abolished March 2009)

The London Assembly was established as a directly elected body by separate legislation and is part of the Greater London Authority. It continues to exist after the abolition of the eight regional chambers.

Each assembly corresponded to a region of England.

== Plans for elected regional assemblies ==

In May 2002, the then Labour UK government published a white paper, &quot;Your Region, Your Choice&quot;, outlining its plans for the possible establishment of Elected Regional Assemblies. These assemblies were to be responsible for regional strategies dealing with sustainable development, economic development, spatial planning, transport, waste, housing, culture (including tourism) and biodiversity. They would be funded primarily by central government grant, with powers to raise additional funds from a precept (demand for payment) on the council tax.

The Assemblies were expected to be elected by an Additional Member System similar to those used for the London Assembly, the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales. The Regional Assemblies (Preparations) Act 2003 made provisions for referendums to be held to create such assemblies, and to simplify the structure of local government where this is done. Three such referendums were planned, for the regions of North East and North West England and Yorkshire and the Humber.

On 12 February 2004, Local Government Minister Nick Raynsford announced that elected Assemblies would be able to direct local authorities to refuse strategic planning applications that are not in the region&#x27;s best interest. They would be able to look across local boundary constraints and ensure planning decisions are made with region-wide interests taken into account. On 8 July 2004, it was announced that the referendums would be held on 4 November, but on 22 July Raynsford announced that only the North East England vote would go ahead on that date. This region was chosen because the government thought it was the most likely to approve the proposal. 

However, the voters rejected the assembly by 696,519 votes to 197,310, or about 78 percent to 22 percent. This overwhelmingly negative vote was seen as an insurmountable obstacle to elected regional assemblies elsewhere in England outside London. On 8 November, Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott told the House of Commons he would not move orders for the other two regions within the effective time limit of June 2005 permitted by the Act.

The &#x27;no&#x27; vote by the North East also affected the Labour Government&#x27;s attempt to address the West Lothian question, because the government had canvassed regional assemblies as a partial solution to this anomaly.

=== Structure and powers of the proposed assemblies ===
The Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott presented a Draft Regional Assemblies Bill to Parliament in July 2004. The bill outlined the structure of the proposed assemblies and defined their powers.

The draft bill proposed the following structure:
* The assembly would be a body corporate with a distinct legal identity.
* Each assembly would be composed of between 25 and 35 assembly members elected by the Additional Member System.
* The assembly would select one member as the Chairman and another as Deputy Chairman to preside over its debates.
* The assembly would have an Executive (cabinet) composed of a Leader and between two and six Executive Members.

The draft bill would have given the assemblies the following powers:
* Promotion of economic development
* Promotion of social development
** Promote health, safety and security of the community
** Reduce health inequalities
** Enhance individual participation in society
** Improve the availability of good housing
** Improve skills and the availability of training
** Improve the availability of cultural and recreational activities
* Improvement and protection of the environment
* Additional functions and duties that the Secretary of State thinks appropriate

== Abolition and replacement ==
On 17 July 2007 the UK government published the &quot;Review of Sub-National Economic Development and Regeneration&quot;. The review brought forward the Government&#x27;s plans to alter the structure of regional governance in England known as the Single Regional Strategy. The impact of the review was that the regional assemblies in their current form and function would not continue and that the regional development agencies were given executive responsibility for developing the single regional strategy.

The regional chambers were abolished between 2008 and 2010 with their executive functions transferring to the regional development agencies. Local authorities were given an increased role in scrutiny at the regional level including scrutiny of regional strategies and the RDAs through participation in new local authority leaders&#x27; boards which were established in each region. The two bodies would jointly produce new single regional strategies, with Ministers exercising an oversight function.

=== Local authority leaders&#x27; boards ===

Following the abolition of the regional chambers, smaller local authority leaders&#x27; boards took over responsibilities for scrutiny of RDAs and single regional plans.

The first local authority leaders&#x27; board, 4NW, was established in July 2008 and others were formed once the regional chamber for that region was abolished. By April 2010, eight leaders&#x27; boards had been established. In June 2010, the new Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government announced plans to remove funding from the new boards and to remove their statutory functions. The boards may continue as voluntary associations of council leaders. Regional development agencies were abolished on 31 March 2012, with their functions being taken over by smaller local enterprise partnerships which are not based on regional boundaries. LEPs were themselves phased out in April 2024.

== Alternative arrangements ==

=== Cornish Assembly ===
In Cornwall, there was opposition to the South West Regional Assembly and the South West Regional Development Agency. A campaign for a Cornish Assembly had been running since July 2000, and attracted the support of a petition signed by 50,000 Cornish residents and visitors, which was presented to 10 Downing Street on 12 December 2001. The campaign had the support of all five Cornish Liberal Democrats MPs, Mebyon Kernow and others; they stated that the SW regional assembly was undemocratic and unaccountable, and believed Cornwall should be able to take decisions about local services in its own directly elected and accountable assembly.

=== Merseyside Assembly ===
In July 2004, five Merseyside MPs, led by George Howarth MP, launched a Manifesto for Merseyside which proposed a Merseyside Assembly, which would take a form similar to the existing London Assembly. As well as the five Merseyside boroughs, the proposals also included the Cheshire authorities of Halton and Ellesmere Port / Neston. The main argument was that the North West was too large and did not represent a cultural or economic area; something Merseyside did better.

=== City regions and combined authorities===

Since the General Election in May 2005, the concept of city regions has gained currency in academic, policy and government circles, with several think tanks pushing the idea as a viable alternative to elected regional assemblies. However, opinion is divided on the question of whether to impose new city regional structures from above or to allow existing elected bodies to come together on a more informal voluntary basis.

=== Devolved English parliament ===
The Campaign for an English Parliament, the minor English Democrats party, and several Conservative Party MPs, see a devolved English parliament as another alternative to regional assemblies. They believe that rather than breaking up the historic nation of England, it should be preserved - with its own parliament similar to that of the Scottish Parliament - and that this is the only way the West Lothian question can be resolved while maintaining the United Kingdom.

<doc id="679202" wikidata="Q766660" url="?curid=679202" title="British Columbia Highway 93">
<text>Highway 93 is a north–south route through the southeastern part of British Columbia, in the Regional District of East Kootenay and takes its number from U.S. Highway 93 that it connects with at the Canada–United States border. It follows the Crowsnest Highway (Highway 3) and Highway 95 through Radium Hot Springs and to where it crosses the Continental Divide into Alberta at Vermilion Pass, where it continues as Alberta Highway 93. The section between the Canada-U.S. border and the Crowsnest Highway is known as the Elko–Roosville Highway, the section between the Crowsnest Highway and Radium Hot Springs is known as the Kootenay–Columbia Highway, while the section east of Radium Hot Springs is known as the Banff–Windermere Parkway.

==Route description==

From the international border crossing at Roosville, the long Highway 93 parallels the eastern shore of Lake Koocanusa for to where it meets the Crowsnest Highway (Highway 3) at Elko. Highway 3 carries Highway 93 west for to where it is handed off to Highway 95 just south of Fort Steele. Highway 95 carries Highway 93 north for another along the Kootenay River and the Columbia River passing through Wasa, Canal Flats, Fairmont Hot Springs and Invermere to Radium Hot Springs, where Highway 95 diverges north towards Golden.

Highway 93 leaves the concurrence and proceeds east from Radium Hot Springs for about to the western gate of Kootenay National Park. Through the park, the highway travels northeast along the Kootenay and Vermilion rivers for to Vermilion Pass and the Alberta border, where it is continues as Alberta Highway 93. After crossing the border, the highway continues for another to meet the Trans-Canada Highway (Alberta Highway 1) near Castle Junction.

==History==

The Highway first opened in 1953 from the international border to Elko, on Highway 3, but it did not follow its current route from the border until 1958. Before 1959, the Banff–Windermere Parkway, the segment of Highway 93 east of Radium Hot Springs, had a designation of Highway 1B, reflecting its connection to the Trans-Canada Highway within Alberta at Castle Junction. In 1959, Highway 93 was extended from Elko along Highway 3 and Highway 95 to Radium Hot Springs, while Highway 1B and the Icefields Parkway (known as Highway 1A) were renumbered to their present designation.

<text>Liberec Region () is an administrative unit (Czech: &quot;kraj&quot;) of the Czech Republic, located in the northernmost part of its historical region of Bohemia. It is named after its capital Liberec. The region shares international borders with Germany and Poland. Domestically the region borders the Ústí nad Labem Region to the west, the Central Bohemian Region to the south and the Hradec Králové Region to the east.

==Administrative divisions==
The Liberec Region is divided into 4 districts:
At a lower level, the region has 215 municipalities, comprising 65 in the Semily District, 59 in the Jablonec nad Nisou District, 57 in the Česká Lípa District and 34 in the Liberec District.

==Cities and towns==
The table below gives an overview of towns and cities in the region that have at least 7,000 inhabitants (as of 1 January 2024).

==Physical geography==
The region&#x27;s landscape includes the Jizera Mountains, part of the Krkonoše Mountains and part of the Lusatian Mountains.

The region was affected by flash floods in August 2010, with swelling of the river Smědá being one of the factors to prompt evacuation efforts in the region.

==Demographics==
As of 1 January 2019, the population of the Liberec Region was 442,356 with 217,791 men and 224,565 women, accounting for 49.2% and 50.8% of the population respectively.

==Economy==
The Liberec Region hosts manufacturing, glassmaking, mechanical engineering and jewellery production industries among others. The region is part of the so-called Black Triangle, an area of heavy industrialization and environmental damage on the three-way border of Poland, Germany, and the Czech Republic.

==Culture==

The Liberec Region is home to 11 national cultural monuments including Bezděz Castle, Dlaskův statek in Dolánky u Turnova and the Ještěd Tower which transmits television signals as well as being a hotel. 2013 saw the proposal of an additional two sites to the list, those being a glass grinding plant in Harrachov dating from 1895 and the Janatův Mlýn watermill in Buřany, Jablonec nad Jizerou part of which remains from 1767.

A Neolithic site dating to around 4,500 BC was uncovered in 2007 near the village of Příšovice.

Lake Mácha near the town of Doksy is an important regional centre for leisure, attracting around 30,000 visitors annually. The vicinity of the lake has a caravan park and hosts an annual music festival called &quot;&quot;, which was attended by approximately 8,000 people in 2013.

Since the region was for a long time part of the Holy Roman Empire, and later (in 1938–1945) the major part of the region was a part of Germany as part of Sudetenland, the local buildings and the culture in general have been influenced by the Germans, also considering the fact that parts of the region were populated by a majority of Sudeten Germans, prior to their expulsion after World War II.

==Transport==
The region is linked to Prague by the D10 motorway, which terminates in the town of Turnov. The length of operated railway lines in the region is . Three airports are in the region; Hradčany Airport, a disused military airport near the town of Ralsko, is the most significant. Other minor airports exist in Česká Lípa and Hodkovice nad Mohelkou.

==Education==
The region is home to the public Technical University of Liberec, which was founded in 1953. The university, which originally specialized in Mechanical and Textile Engineering, added a further four faculties in the 1990s, namely those specialising in Education, Economy, Architecture and Mechatronics.

<text>A telegraph code is one of the character encodings used to transmit information by telegraphy. Morse code is the best-known such code. &quot;Telegraphy&quot; usually refers to the electrical telegraph, but telegraph systems using the optical telegraph were in use before that. A code consists of a number of code points, each corresponding to a letter of the alphabet, a numeral, or some other character. In codes intended for machines rather than humans, code points for control characters, such as carriage return, are required to control the operation of the mechanism. Each code point is made up of a number of elements arranged in a unique way for that character. There are usually two types of element (a binary code), but more element types were employed in some codes not intended for machines. For instance, American Morse code had about five elements, rather than the two (dot and dash) of International Morse Code.

Codes meant for human interpretation were designed so that the characters that occurred most often had the fewest elements in the corresponding code point. For instance, Morse code for &quot;E&quot;, the most common letter in English, is a single dot (), whereas &quot;Q&quot; is . These arrangements meant the message could be sent more quickly and it would take longer for the operator to become fatigued. Telegraphs were always operated by humans until late in the 19th century. When automated telegraph messages came in, codes with variable-length code points were inconvenient for machine design of the period. Instead, codes with a fixed length were used. The first of these was the Baudot code, a five-bit code. Baudot has only enough code points to print in upper case. Later codes had more bits (ASCII has seven) so that both upper and lower case could be printed. Beyond the telegraph age, modern computers require a very large number of code points (Unicode has 21 bits) so that multiple languages and alphabets (character sets) can be handled without having to change the character encoding. Modern computers can easily handle variable-length codes such as UTF-8 and UTF-16 which have now become ubiquitous.

==Manual telegraph codes==
===Optical telegraph codes===

Prior to the electrical telegraph, a widely used method of building national telegraph networks was the optical telegraph consisting of a chain of towers from which signals could be sent by semaphore or shutters from tower to tower. This was particularly highly developed in France and had its beginnings during the French Revolution. The code used in France was the Chappe code, named after Claude Chappe the inventor. The British Admiralty also used the semaphore telegraph, but with their own code. The British code was necessarily different from that used in France because the British optical telegraph worked in a different way. The Chappe system had moveable arms, as if it were waving flags as in flag semaphore. The British system used an array of shutters that could be opened or closed.

====Chappe code====
The Chappe system consisted of a large pivoted beam (the regulator) with an arm at each end (the indicators) which pivoted around the regulator on one extremity. The angles these components were allowed to take was limited to multiples of 45° to aid readability. This gave a code space of 8×4×8 code points, but the indicator position inline with the regulator was never used because it was hard to distinguish from the indicator being folded back on top of the regulator, leaving a code space of . Symbols were always formed with the regulator on either the left- or right-leaning diagonal (oblique) and only accepted as valid when the regulator moved to either the vertical or horizontal position. The left oblique was always used for messages, with the right oblique being used for control of the system. This further reduced the code space to 98, of which either four or six code points (depending on version) were control characters, leaving a code space for text of 94 or 92 respectively.

The Chappe system mostly transmitted messages using a code book with a large number of set words and phrases. It was first used on an experimental chain of towers in 1793 and put into service from Paris to Lille in 1794. The code book used this early is not known for certain, but an unidentified code book in the Paris Postal Museum may have been for the Chappe system. The arrangement of this code in columns of 88 entries led Holzmann &amp; Pehrson to suggest that 88 code points might have been used. However, the proposal in 1793 was for ten code points representing the numerals 0–9, and Bouchet says this system was still in use as late as 1800 (Holzmann &amp; Pehrson put the change at 1795). The code book was revised and simplified in 1795 to speed up transmission. The code was in two divisions, the first division was 94 alphabetic and numeric characters plus some commonly used letter combinations. The second division was a code book of 94 pages with 94 entries on each page. A code point was assigned for each number up to 94. Thus, only two symbols needed to be sent to transmit an entire sentence – the page and line numbers of the code book, compared to four symbols using the ten-symbol code.

In 1799, three additional divisions were added. These had additional words and phrases, geographical places, and names of people. These three divisions required extra symbols to be added in front of the code symbol to identify the correct book. The code was revised again in 1809 and remained stable thereafter. In 1837 a horizontal only coding system was introduced by Gabriel Flocon which did not require the heavy regulator to be moved. Instead, an additional indicator was provided in the centre of the regulator to transmit that element of the code.

====Edelcrantz code====

The Edelcrantz system was used in Sweden and was the second largest network built after that of France. The telegraph consisted of a set of ten shutters. Nine of these were arranged in a 3×3 matrix. Each column of shutters represented a binary-coded octal digit with a closed shutter representing &quot;1&quot; and the most significant digit at the bottom. Each symbol of telegraph transmission was thus a three-digit octal number. The tenth shutter was an extra-large one at the top. Its meaning was that the codepoint should be preceded by &quot;A&quot;.

One use of the &quot;A&quot; shutter was that a numeral codepoint preceded by &quot;A&quot; meant add a zero (multiply by ten) to the digit. Larger numbers could be indicated by following the numeral with the code for hundreds (236), thousands (631) or a combination of these. This required fewer symbols to be transmitted than sending all the zero digits individually. However, the main purpose of the &quot;A&quot; codepoints was for a codebook of predetermined messages, much like the Chappe codebook.

The symbols without &quot;A&quot; were a large set of numerals, letters, common syllables and words to aid code compaction. Around 1809, Edelcrantz introduced a new codebook with 5,120 codepoints, each requiring a two-symbol transmission to identify.

There were many codepoints for error correction (272, error), flow control, and supervisory messages. Usually, messages were expected to be passed all the way down the line, but there were circumstances when individual stations needed to communicate directly, usually for managerial purposes. The most common, and simplest situation was communication between adjacent stations. Codepoints 722 and 227 were used for this purpose, to get the attention of the next station towards, or away from, the sun, respectively. For more remote stations codepoints 557 and 755 respectively were used, followed by the identification of the requesting and target stations.

====Wig-wag====
Flag signalling was widely used for point-to-point signalling prior to the optical telegraph, but it was difficult to construct a nationwide network with hand-held flags. The much larger mechanical apparatus of the semaphore telegraph towers was needed so that a greater distance between links could be achieved. However, an extensive network with hand-held flags was constructed during the American Civil War. This was the wig-wag system which used the code invented by Albert J. Myer. Some of the towers used were enormous, up to 130 feet, to get a good range. Myer&#x27;s code required only one flag using a ternary code. That is, each code element consisted of one of three distinct flag positions. However, the alphabetical codepoints required only two positions, the third position only being used in control characters. Using a ternary code in the alphabet would have resulted in shorter messages because fewer elements are required in each codepoint, but a binary system is easier to read at long distance since fewer flag positions need to be distinguished. Myer&#x27;s manual also describes a ternary-coded alphabet with a fixed length of three elements for each codepoint.

===Electrical telegraph codes===
====Cooke and Wheatstone and other early codes====

Many different codes were invented during the early development of the electrical telegraph. Virtually every inventor produced a different code to suit their particular apparatus. The earliest code used commercially on an electrical telegraph was the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph five needle code (C&amp;W5). This was first used on the Great Western Railway in 1838. C&amp;W5 had the major advantage that the code did not need to be learned by the operator; the letters could be read directly off the display board. However, it had the disadvantage that it required too many wires. A one needle code, C&amp;W1, was developed that required only one wire. C&amp;W1 was widely used in the UK and the British Empire.

Some other countries used C&amp;W1, but it never became an international standard and generally each country developed their own code. In the US, American Morse code was used, whose elements consisted of dots and dashes distinguished from each other by the length of the pulse of current on the telegraph line. This code was used on the telegraph invented by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail and was first used commercially in 1844. Morse initially had code points only for numerals. He planned that numbers sent over the telegraph would be used as an index to a dictionary with a limited set of words. Vail invented an extended code that included code points for all the letters so that any desired word could be sent. It was Vail&#x27;s code that became American Morse. In France, the telegraph used the Foy-Breguet telegraph, a two-needle telegraph that displayed the needles in Chappe code, the same code as the French optical telegraph, which was still more widely used than the electrical telegraph in France. To the French, this had the great advantage that they did not need to retrain their operators in a new code.

====Standardisation—Morse code====

In Germany in 1848, Friedrich Clemens Gerke developed a heavily modified version of American Morse for use on German railways. American Morse had three different lengths of dashes and two different lengths of space between the dots and dashes in a code point. The Gerke code had only one length of dash and all inter-element spaces within a code point were equal. Gerke also created code points for the German umlaut letters, which do not exist in English. Many central European countries belonged to the German-Austrian Telegraph Union. In 1851, the Union decided to adopt a common code across all its countries so that messages could be sent between them without the need for operators to recode them at borders. The Gerke code was adopted for this purpose.

In 1865, a conference in Paris adopted the Gerke code as the international standard, calling it International Morse Code. With some very minor changes, this is the Morse code used today. The Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph needle instruments were capable of using Morse code since dots and dashes could be sent as left and right movements of the needle. By this time, the needle instruments were being made with end stops that made two distinctly different notes as the needle hit them. This enabled the operator to write the message without looking up at the needle which was much more efficient. This was a similar advantage to the Morse telegraph in which the operators could hear the message from the clicking of the relay armature. Nevertheless, after the British telegraph companies were nationalised in 1870 the General Post Office decided to standardise on the Morse telegraph and get rid of the many different systems they had inherited from private companies.

In the US, telegraph companies refused to use International Morse because of the cost of retraining operators. They opposed attempts by the government to make it law. In most other countries, the telegraph was state controlled so the change could simply be mandated. In the US, there was no single entity running the telegraph. Rather, it was a multiplicity of private companies. This resulted in international operators needing to be fluent in both versions of Morse and to recode both incoming and outgoing messages. The US continued to use American Morse on landlines (radiotelegraphy generally used International Morse) and this remained the case until the advent of teleprinters which required entirely different codes and rendered the issue moot.

====Transmission speed====

The speed of sending in a manual telegraph is limited by the speed the operator can send each code element. Speeds are typically stated in words per minute. Words are not all the same length, so literally counting the words will get a different result depending on message content. Instead, a word is defined as five characters for the purpose of measuring speed, regardless of how many words are actually in the message. Morse code, and many other codes, also do not have the same length of code for each character of the word, again introducing a content-related variable. To overcome this, the speed of the operator repeatedly transmitting a standard word is used. PARIS is classically chosen as this standard because that is the length of an average word in Morse.

In American Morse, the characters are generally shorter than International Morse. This is partly because American Morse uses more dot elements, and partly because the most common dash, the short dash, is shorter than the International Morse dash—two dot elements against three dot elements long. In principle, American Morse will be transmitted faster than International Morse if all other variables are equal. In practice, there are two things that detract from this. Firstly, American Morse, with around five coding elements was harder to get the timings right when sent quickly. Inexperienced operators were apt to send garbled messages, an effect known as hog Morse. The second reason is that American Morse is more prone to intersymbol interference (ISI) because of the larger density of closely spaced dots. This problem was particularly severe on submarine telegraph cables, making American Morse less suitable for international communications. The only solution an operator had immediately to hand to deal with ISI was to slow down the transmission speed.

====Language character encodings====
Morse code for non-Latin alphabets, such as Cyrillic or Arabic script, is achieved by constructing a character encoding for the alphabet in question using the same, or nearly the same code points as used in the Latin alphabet. Syllabaries, such as Japanese katakana, are also handled this way (Wabun code). The alternative of adding more code points to Morse code for each new character would result in code transmissions being very long in some languages.

Languages that use logograms are more difficult to handle due to the much larger number of characters required. The Chinese telegraph code uses a codebook of around 9,800 characters (7,000 when originally launched in 1871) which are each assigned a four-digit number. It is these numbers that are transmitted, so Chinese Morse code consists entirely of numerals. The numbers must be looked up at the receiving end making this a slow process, but in the era when telegraph was widely used, skilled Chinese telegraphers could recall many thousands of the common codes from memory. The Chinese telegraph code is still used by law enforcement because it is an unambiguous method of recording Chinese names in non-Chinese scripts.

==Automatic telegraph codes==
===Baudot code===

Early printing telegraphs continued to use Morse code, but the operator no longer sent the dots and dashes directly with a single key. Instead they operated a piano keyboard with the characters to be sent marked on each key. The machine generated the appropriate Morse code point from the key press. An entirely new type of code was developed by Émile Baudot, patented in 1874. The Baudot code was a 5-bit binary code, with the bits sent serially. Having a fixed length code greatly simplified the machine design. The operator entered the code from a small 5-key piano keyboard, each key corresponding to one bit of the code. Like Morse, Baudot code was organised to minimise operator fatigue with the code points requiring the fewest key presses assigned to the most common letters.

Early printing telegraphs required mechanical synchronisation between the sending and receiving machine. The Hughes printing telegraph of 1855 achieved this by sending a Morse dash every revolution of the machine. A different solution was adopted in conjunction with the Baudot code. Start and stop bits were added to each character on transmission, which allowed asynchronous serial communication. This scheme of start and stop bits was followed on all the later major telegraph codes.

===Murray code===
On busy telegraph lines, a variant of the Baudot code was used with punched paper tape. This was the Murray code, invented by Donald Murray in 1901. Instead of directly transmitting to the line, the keypresses of the operator punched holes in the tape. Each row of holes across the tape had five possible positions to punch, corresponding to the five bits of the Murray code. The tape was then run through a tape reader which generated the code and sent it down the telegraph line. The advantage of this system was that multiple messages could be sent to line very fast from one tape, making better use of the line than direct manual operation could.

Murray completely rearranged the character encoding to minimise wear on the machine since operator fatigue was no longer an issue. Thus, the character sets of the original Baudot and the Murray codes are not compatible. The five bits of the Baudot code are insufficient to represent all the letters, numerals, and punctuation required in a text message. Further, additional characters are required by printing telegraphs to better control the machine. Examples of these control characters are line feed and carriage return. Murray solved this problem by introducing shift codes. These codes instruct the receiving machine to change the character encoding to a different character set. Two shift codes were used in the Murray code; figure shift and letter shift. Another control character introduced by Murray was the delete character (DEL, code 11111) which punched out all five holes on the tape. Its intended purpose was to remove erroneous characters from the tape, but Murray also used multiple DELs to mark the boundary between messages. Having all the holes punched out made a perforation which was easy to tear into separate messages at the receiving end. A variant of the Baudot–Murray code became an international standard as International Telegraph Alphabet no. 2 (ITA 2) in 1924. The &quot;2&quot; in ITA 2 is because the original Baudot code became the basis for ITA 1. ITA 2 remained the standard telegraph code in use until the 1960s and was still in use in places well beyond then.
==TeleTypeSetter==
The teleprinter was invented in 1915. This is a printing telegraph with a typewriter-like keyboard on which the operator types the message. Nevertheless, telegrams continued to be sent in upper case only because there was not room for a lower case character set in Baudot–Murray or ITA 2 codes.

Teleprinters were quickly adopted by news organizations, and &quot;wire services&quot; supplying stories to multiple newspapers developed, but an additional application soon arose: sending finished copy from an urban newsroom to a remote printing plant. The limited character repertoire of the 5-level codes meant that someone had to manually retype the telegram in mixed case, a laborious and error-prone operation.

The Monotype system already had separate keyboards and casters communicating by a paper tape, but it used a very wide 28-position paper tape to select one of 15 rows and 15 columns in the matrix case. To compete, the Mergenthaler Linotype Company developed a TeleTypeSetter (TTS) system which functioned similarly, but using a narrower 6-level code (the name &quot;bit&quot; would not be coined until 1948) which was more economical to transmit. TTS retained shift and unshift control characters, but they operated much like a modern keyboard: the unshift state provided lower-case letters, digits, and common punctuation, while the shift state provided upper-case letters and special symbols. TTS also included Linotype-specific features such as ligatures and a second &quot;upper rail&quot; shift function usually used for italic type.

A typewriter-like &quot;perforator&quot; would create a paper tape, and had a large dial showing the length of the line so far at the minimum and maximum spaceband width so the typist could decide where to break lines. This tape was then transmitted to &quot;reperforator&quot;, and the recreated paper tape was fed into a Linotype machine with a tape reader at the printing plant. (The tape reader could be retrofitted to an existing Linotype machine, but also special high-speed Linotype machines were made which could operate faster than a manual operator could type.)

An operator was still required to handle the tapes, take the finished type to layout, add type metal as needed, clear jams, and so on, but one operator could manage multiple Linotype machines.

To keep the feed perforations in the middle of the tape, the TTS code added a &quot;0&quot; row beside the &quot;1&quot; row in ITA-2. To show the similarity to the ITS-2 code, the following tables are sorted as if this is the most-significant bit.

Each shift state has 41 unique characters, making 82 in total. Adding the 8 fixed-width characters which are duplicated in the two shift states, this matches the 90-matrix capacity of a standard Linotype machine. (The variable-width space bands are a 91st character.)

==Computer age==
The first computers used existing 5-bit ITA-2 keyboards and printers due to their easy availability, but the limited character repertoire quickly became a pain point.

===ASCII===
By the 1960s, improving teleprinter technology meant that longer codes were nowhere near as significant a factor in teleprinter costs as they once were. The computer users wanted lowercase characters and additional punctuation, while both teleprinter and computer manufacturers wished to get rid of shift codes. This led the American Standards Association to develop a 7-bit code, the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII). The final form of ASCII was published in 1964 and it rapidly became the standard teleprinter code. ASCII was the last major code developed explicitly with telegraphy equipment in mind. Telegraphy rapidly declined after this and was largely replaced by computer networks, especially the Internet in the 1990s.

ASCII had several features geared to aid computer programming. The letter characters were in numerical order of code point, so an alphabetical sort could be achieved simply by sorting the data numerically. The code point for corresponding upper and lower case letters differed only by the value of bit 6, allowing a mix of cases to be sorted alphabetically if this bit was ignored. Other codes were introduced, notably IBM&#x27;s EBCDIC derived from the punched card method of input, but it was ASCII and its derivatives that won out as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of computer information exchange.

===ASCII extension and Unicode===
The arrival of the microprocessor in the 1970s and the personal computer in the 1980s with their 8-bit architecture led to the 8-bit byte becoming the standard unit of computer storage. Packing 7-bit data into 8-bit storage is inconvenient for data retrieval. Instead, most computers stored one ASCII character per byte. This left one bit over that was not doing anything useful. Computer manufacturers used this bit in extended ASCII to overcome some of the limitations of standard ASCII. The main issue was that ASCII was geared to English, particularly American English, and lacked the accented vowels used in other European languages such as French. Currency symbols for other countries were also added to the character set. Unfortunately, different manufacturers implemented different extended ASCIIs making them incompatible across platforms. In 1987, the International Standards Organisation issued the standard ISO 8859-1, for an 8-bit character encoding based on 7-bit ASCII which was widely taken up.

ISO 8859 character encodings were developed for non-Latin scripts such as Cyrillic, Hebrew, Arabic, and Greek. This was still problematic if a document or data used more than one script. Multiple switches between character encodings was required. This was solved by the publication in 1991 of the standard for 16-bit Unicode, in development since 1987. Unicode maintained ASCII characters at the same code points for compatibility. As well as support for non-Latin scripts, Unicode provided code points for logograms such as Chinese characters and many specialist characters such as astrological and mathematical symbols. In 1996, Unicode 2.0 allowed code points greater than 16-bit; up to 20-bit, and 21-bit with an additional private use area. 20-bit Unicode provided support for extinct languages such as Old Italic script and many rarely used Chinese characters.

==International Code of Signals (radiotelegraph)==
In 1931, the International Code of Signals, originally created for ship communication by signalling using flags, was expanded by adding a collection of five-letter codes to be used by radiotelegraph operators.

==== Table 2 notes ====

An alternative representation of needle codes is to use the numeral &quot;1&quot; for needle left, and &quot;3&quot; for needle right. The numeral &quot;2&quot;, which does not appear in most codes represents the needle in the neutral upright position. The codepoints using this scheme are marked on the face of some needle instruments, especially those used for training.

=== Comparison of dot-dash codes ===


==== Table 3 notes ====

When used with a printing telegraph or siphon recorder, the &quot;dashes&quot; of dot-dash codes are often made the same length as the &quot;dot&quot;. Typically, the mark on the tape for a dot is made above the mark for a dash. An example of this can be seen in the 1837 Steinheil code, which is nearly identical to the 1849 Steinheil code, except that they are represented differently in the table. International Morse code was commonly used in this form on submarine telegraph cables.

<text>In maritime law, flotsam,&quot;jetsam,&quot; lagan&quot;,&quot; and derelict are terms for various types of property lost or abandoned at sea. The words have specific nautical meanings, with legal consequences in the law of admiralty and marine salvage. A shipwreck is defined as the remains of a ship that has been wrecked, whether it has sunk or is floating on the surface of the water.

==Overview==
A wreck is categorized as property belonging to no apparent owner that either sinks to the seabed or floats on the surface of the water, whether it be intentionally cast overboard or as the result of an accident. The term encompasses the hull of the vessel and its fixtures as well as any other form of object on board, such as cargo and stores, and personal effects of the crew and passengers. This also encompasses the narrower definition of salvage, that is, property that has been recovered from a wreckage, or the recovery of the ship itself.
There are a number of factors that contribute to the formation of a shipwreck, which can be divided into physical and cultural processes. A site can be affected by physical processes, that is, naturally occurring processes, such as the corrosion caused by salinity and ocean currents, or the growth of native and foreign marine organisms. It can also be affected by cultural processes, that is, by human interactions, such as adding or removing materials from the site of the wreck. Any archaeological activity, such as excavation, may also be considered invasive and tampering.

In maritime law, different meanings are attributed to the terms, based on jurisdiction as well as context. For example, a distinction is made between goods that wash ashore and those that are for some reason not salvageable and/or lost at sea.

==Law of salvage==
Ownership of a wreck is a highly controversial issue, as there are no clear lines within which it is defined. It may be acquired through various means that range from succession to confiscation. There is also a distinction to be made between the ownership of the hull itself and the cargo it contains, as the hull may be abandoned intentionally, whereas the cargo may be out of necessity (in the case of an emergency or the need to shed weight from the vessel). In these parameters, abandonment of the ship by its passengers constitutes a loss of possession, but to abandon the claim on the title itself, intention to relinquish it is required. This affects wrecks by limiting that which is considered &quot;abandoned&quot;. Generally, a ship is defined as &quot;abandoned&quot; if there is no hope of recovery, known legally as &quot;sine spe recuperandi&quot; (which is the Latin phrase for &quot;without hope of recovery&quot;), and this fact must be clearly proven by the salvaging party. It must also occur on navigable waters.
The term &quot;salvage&quot; is used to indicate a salvage operation, as well as the subsequent awarded compensation. It is considered a voluntary service rendered in cases such as danger to the wreck, or the surrounding navigable waters. In terms of compensation, it is seen as being awarded to anyone who voluntarily assisted in the recuperation of the wreck, whether it be saved from upcoming danger, or from loss.

The law of salvage has its origins in the Roman practice of &quot;negotiorum gestio&quot;, which dictated that one who preserved or improved upon the property of another was owed compensation from the owner, even if the service was not requested by the latter. The law did not apply to maritime regulations, but were the basis for following ordinances, such as the Marine Ordinance of Trani, which stated that a &quot;finder&quot; was to be rewarded, whether the owner claimed the goods or not. The laws have evolved since &quot;negotiorum gestio&quot;, and today, in the United States, a salvor who voluntarily brings the goods back into port may legally lay claim to them, or deliver them to a marshal, in return for a reward.

==Flotsam==

Flotsam (also known as &quot;flotsan&quot;) refers to goods from a sunken vessel that have floated to the surface of the sea, or any floating cargo that is cast overboard.

In maritime law, flotsam pertains to goods that are floating on the surface of the water as the result of a wreck or accident. One who discovers flotsam is allowed to claim it unless someone else establishes their ownership of it. Even when the source is known, items may be considered flotsam claimable by the finder. This occurred with up to 110 cargo containers lost by &quot;MSC Zoe&quot; in heavy seas in January 2019 off the German shore of Borkum; the lost goods found on the Dutch coast were considered flotsam.

Jetsam designates any cargo that is intentionally discarded from a ship or wreckage. Legally jetsam also floats, although floating is not part of the etymological meaning. Generally, &quot;jettisoning&quot; connotes the action of throwing goods overboard to lighten the load of a ship in danger of sinking.

Per maritime law, one who discovers these artifacts is not required to return them to their rightful owner except in the case where the latter makes a proper claim.

However, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration &quot;flotsam may be claimed by the original owner, whereas jetsam may be claimed as property of whoever discovers it&quot;.

==Lagan==

Lagan (also called &quot;ligan&quot;) are goods cast overboard and heavy enough to sink to the ocean floor, but linked to a floating marker, such as a buoy or cork, so that they can be found again by the person who marked the item. Lagan can also be large objects trapped within the sinking vessel.

According to maritime law, a buoy or other floating object constitutes sufficient grounds for laying claim to an artifact. Lagan must be returned to the rightful owner.

==Derelict==
Derelict can refer to goods that have sunk to the ocean floor, relinquished willingly or forcefully by its owner, and thus abandoned, but which no one has any hope of reclaiming.

In terms of maritime law, derelict is considered property abandoned on navigable waters which has no hope of being recovered, or &quot;sine spe recuperandi&quot;, and no expectation of it being returned to its owner, or &quot;sine animo revertendi&quot;.

<text>ESC/Java (and more recently ESC/Java2), the &quot;Extended Static Checker for Java,&quot; is a programming tool that attempts to find common run-time errors in Java programs at compile time. The underlying approach used in ESC/Java is referred to as extended static checking, which is a collective name referring to a range of techniques for statically checking the correctness of various program constraints. For example, that an integer variable is greater-than-zero, or lies between the bounds of an array. This technique was pioneered in ESC/Java (and its predecessor, ESC/Modula-3) and can be thought of as an extended form of type checking. Extended static checking usually involves the use of an automated theorem prover and, in ESC/Java, the Simplify theorem prover was used.

ESC/Java is neither sound nor complete. This was intentional and aims to reduce the number of errors and/or warnings reported to the programmer, in order to make the tool more useful in practice. However, it does mean that: firstly, there are programs that ESC/Java will erroneously consider to be incorrect (known as &quot;false-positives&quot;); secondly, there are incorrect programs it will consider to be correct (known as &quot;false-negatives&quot;). Examples in the latter category include errors arising from modular arithmetic and/or multithreading.

ESC/Java was originally developed at the Compaq Systems Research Center (SRC). SRC launched the project in 1997, after work on their original extended static checker, ESC/Modula-3, ended in 1996. In 2002, SRC released the source code for ESC/Java and related tools. Recent versions of ESC/Java are based around the Java Modeling Language (JML). Users can control the amount and kinds of checking by annotating their programs with specially formatted comments or &quot;pragmas&quot;.

The University of Nijmegen&#x27;s &quot;Security of Systems&quot; group released alpha versions of ESC/Java2, an extended version of ESC/Java that processes the JML specification language through 2004. From 2004 to 2009, ESC/Java2 development was managed by the KindSoftware Research Group at University College Dublin, which in 2009 moved to the IT University of Copenhagen, and in 2012 to the Technical University of Denmark. Over the years, ESC/Java2 has gained many new features including the ability to reason with multiple theorem provers and integration with Eclipse.

OpenJML, the successor of ESC/Java2, is available for Java 1.8. The source is available at https://github.com/OpenJML

<text>The Fenni were an ancient people of northeastern Europe, first described by Cornelius Tacitus in &quot;Germania&quot; in AD 98.

== Ancient accounts ==

The Fenni are first mentioned by Cornelius Tacitus in &quot;Germania&quot; in 98 A.D. Their location is uncertain, due to the vagueness of Tacitus&#x27; account: &quot;The Venedi overrun in their predatory excursions all the woody and mountainous tracts between the Peucini and the Fenni&quot;. The Greco-Roman geographer Ptolemy, who produced his &quot;Geographia&quot; in ca. 150 AD, mentions a people called the &quot;Phinnoi&quot; (Φιννοι), generally believed to be synonymous with the Fenni. He locates them in two different areas: a northern group in northern &quot;Scandia&quot; (Scandinavia), then believed to be an island; and a southern group, apparently dwelling to the East of the upper Vistula river (SE Poland). It remains unclear what was the relationship between the two groups.

The next ancient mention of the Fenni/Finni is in the &quot;Getica&quot; of 6th-century chronicler Jordanes. In his description of the island of &quot;Scandza&quot; (Scandinavia), he mentions three groups with names similar to Ptolemy&#x27;s Phinnoi, the &quot;Screrefennae&quot;, &quot;Finnaithae&quot; and &quot;mitissimi Finni&quot; (&quot;softest Finns&quot;). The Screrefennae is believed to mean the &quot;skiing Finns&quot; and are generally identified with Ptolemy&#x27;s northern Phinnoi and today&#x27;s Finns. The Finnaithae have been identified with the Finnveden of southern Sweden. It is unclear who the &quot;mitissimi Finni&quot; was.

== Ethno-linguistic affiliation ==

Tacitus was unsure whether to classify the Fenni as Germanic or Sarmatian. The vagueness of his account has left the identification of the Fenni open to a variety of theories. It has been suggested that the Romans may have used &quot;Fenni&quot; as a generic name, to denote the various non-Germanic (i.e. Balto-Slavic and Finno-Ugric) tribes of north-eastern Europe. Against this argument is the fact that Tacitus distinguishes the Fenni from other probably non-Germanic peoples of the region, such as the Aestii and the Veneti.

It has also been suggested that Tacitus&#x27; Fenni could be the ancestors of the modern Finnish people. Juha Pentikäinen writes that Tacitus may well have been describing the Sámi or the proto-Finns when referring to the Fenni, noting some archeologists have identified these people as indigenous to Fennoscandia. The context of Fenni has also included the Finnic Estonians throughout different interpretations. Nevertheless, according to some linguists, certain linguistic evidence may be interpreted supporting the idea of an archaic Indo-European dialect and unknown Paleo-European languages existing in north-eastern Baltic Sea region before the spread of Finno-Ugric languages like Proto-Sámi and Proto-Finnic in the early Bronze Age around 1800 BC. However, in Tacitus&#x27;s time (1st century AD) Finno-Ugric languages (Proto-Sámi and Proto-Finnic) were the main languages in northern Fennoscandia.

Another theory is that Tacitus&#x27; Fenni and Ptolemy&#x27;s northern Phinnoi were the same people and constituted the original Sámi people of northern Fennoscandia, making Tacitus&#x27; description the first historical record of them, and the mention of two different &quot;Phinnoi&quot; groups may suggest that there was already a division between Finns and Sámi. But while this may seem a plausible identification for the Phinnoi of northern Scandinavia, it is dubious for Tacitus&#x27; Fenni. Tacitus&#x27; Fenni (and Ptolemy&#x27;s southern Phinnoi) were clearly based in continental Europe, not in the Scandinavian peninsula, and were thus outside the modern range of the Sámi. Against this, there is some archaeological evidence that the Sámi range may have been wider in antiquity. Sámi toponyms are found as far as Southern Finland and Karelia

The uncertainties have led some scholars to conclude that Tacitus&#x27; Fenni is a meaningless label, impossible to ascribe to any particular region or ethnic group. But Tacitus appears to relate the Fenni geographically to the Peucini(Bastarnae) and the Venedi, albeit imprecisely, stating that the latter habitually raided the &quot;forests and mountains&quot; between the other two. He also gives a relatively detailed description of the Fenni&#x27;s lifestyle.

== Material culture ==

&quot;Fenni&quot; seems to have been a form of the proto-Germanic word &quot;*fanþian-&quot;, denoting &quot;wanderers&quot; or &quot;hunting folk&quot;, although Vladimir Orel viewed its etymology as unclear and listed a couple of alternative proposals (i.e. a derivation from Proto-Celtic *þenn- &quot;hill&quot;). Tacitus describes the Fenni as follows:

In wonderful savageness live the nation of the Fenni, and in beastly poverty, destitute of arms, of horses, and of homes; their food, the common herbs; their apparel, skins; their bed, the earth; their only hope in their arrows, which for want of iron they point with bones. Their common support they have from the chase, women as well as men; for with these the former wander up and down, and crave a portion of the prey. Nor other shelter have they even for their babes, against the violence of tempests and ravening beasts, than to cover them with the branches of trees twisted together; this a reception for the old men, and hither resort the young. Such a condition they judge happier than the painful occupation of cultivating the ground, than the labour of rearing houses than the agitations of hope and fear attending the defense of their own property or the seizing that of others. Secure against the designs of men, secure against the malignity of the Gods, they have accomplished a thing of infinite difficulty; that to them nothing remains even to be wished.

This description is of a lifestyle much more primitive than that of the medieval Sámi, who were pastoralists living off herds of reindeer and inhabiting sophisticated tents of deer hide. But the archaeological evidence suggests that the proto-Sámi and Proto-Finns had a lifestyle more akin to Tacitus&#x27; description.

<text>Archgallo (&quot;Welsh:&quot; &quot;Arthal map Morydd&quot;) was a legendary king of the Britons as recounted by Geoffrey of Monmouth. He ruled from 339BC. He was the second son of King Morvidus and brother of Gorbonianus.

Archgallo began as an evil king bent on destroying the nobles and undoing all his brother had done. He gained a fortune of stolen wealth from the nobles. This caused the nobles to rebel and they deposed Archgallo and replaced him with his brother, Elidurus.

Archgallo wandered throughout the neighbouring countries for five years without friends or a home until he returned to Britain. While he was wandering in the Forests of Calaterium, his brother, Elidurus, found him and embraced him as a brother. He took him to a nearby city and hid him in a room. For a year, Elidurus faked sickness and required all the nobles of the kingdom to visit him. Once there, Elidurus demanded each pledge their allegiance to Archgallo again or they would be beheaded. They complied and after the last had pledged, Elidurus took Archgallo to York and removed his own crown and reinstated Archgallo&#x27;s kingship. This story is told by William Wordsworth in his poem Artegal and Elidure.

During Archgallo&#x27;s second reign, he ruled peacefully and faithfully never reverting to his former ways. For ten years he gave the deserved their proper wealth and administered justice throughout the realm. Finally, he fell into a coma and died. He was buried in Leicester and succeeded by Elidurus. Two of Archgallo&#x27;s sons would later become kings of Britain; Marganus II and Enniaunus.

<text>John Barkley Rosser Sr. (December 6, 1907 – September 5, 1989) was an American logician, a student of Alonzo Church, and known for his part in the Church–Rosser theorem in lambda calculus. He also developed what is now called the &quot;Rosser sieve&quot; in number theory. He was part of the mathematics department at Cornell University from 1936 to 1963, chairing it several times. He was later director of the Army Mathematics Research Center at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and the first director of the Communications Research Division of IDA. Rosser also authored mathematical textbooks.

In 1936, he proved Rosser&#x27;s trick, a stronger version of Gödel&#x27;s first incompleteness theorem, showing that the requirement for ω-consistency may be weakened to consistency. Rather than using the liar paradox sentence equivalent to &quot;I am not provable,&quot; he used a sentence that stated &quot;For every proof of me, there is a shorter proof of my negation&quot;.

In prime number theory, he proved Rosser&#x27;s theorem.

The Kleene–Rosser paradox showed that the original lambda calculus was inconsistent.

Rosser died of an aneurysm September 5, 1989, at his home in Madison, Wisconsin.

Rosser&#x27;s son, John Barkley Rosser Jr., was a mathematical economist and professor at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia.

<text>Ingenius (&quot;Welsh:&quot; &quot;Owain map Morydd&quot;) is a legendary king of the Britons as recounted by Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s pseudohistorical work Historia Regum Britanniae (The History of the Kings of Britain), written c. 1138 CE. Ingenius was the fourth son of King Morvidus and the brother of Gorbonianus, Archgallo, Elidurus, and Peredurus. He came to power in 317BC.

Following the return of Elidurus to the kingship of Britain, Ingenius joined with his brother Peredurus and attacked their older brother. They succeeded in capturing him and locked him in a guarded tower in Trinovantum. Instead of fighting over who ruled the island, they split the island, giving all land south and west of the River Humber to Ingenius and all land to the north and east, including Albany, to Peredurus. He ruled his portion of the island for seven years then died, giving the whole of the island to his brother, Peredurus. His son Idvallo would later become king of Britain.

<text>Elidurus the Dutiful (&quot;Welsh:&quot; &quot;Elidyr map Morydd&quot;) was a legendary king of the Britons as recounted by Geoffrey of Monmouth. He reigned in the late fourth century BC. He was the third son of King Morvidus and brother of Gorbonianus, Archgallo, Ingenius, and Peredurus.

Elidurus became king following the deposition of his brother, Archgallo. He found his brother wandering in a forest five years after Elidurus was crowned. He embraced him as a brother and took Archgallo in secrecy to a nearby city. Faking a sickness, he summoned all the nobles of the kingdom to that city to visit him. Once there, Elidurus demanded they all repledge their allegiance to Archgallo under penalty of death. Once done, Elidurus took Archgallo to York and removed his own crown and reinstated Archgallo as king of the Britons. For this, he was surnamed &quot;the Dutiful&quot;.

Ten years later, Archgallo died and Elidurus became king once again. He reigned for a few years in the manner of his eldest brother, Gorbonianus. Soon after, though, his two younger brothers, Ingenius and Peredurus, built armies and attacked Elidurus. They seized him and locked him in a guarded tower in Trinovantum. He remained locked in the tower for more than seven years.

When his youngest brother, Peredurus, finally died, the realm returned to Elidurus for a third time. He reigned for a short while in justice and virtue then died. He was succeeded by an unnamed son of Gorbonianus. His son, Gerennus, would later become king of Britain.

The first branch of the bank in Amritsar was established on 24 June 1908 by Bhai Vir Singh, Sir Sunder Singh Majitha, and Sardar Tarlochan Singh to serve the then Sind and Punjab areas of colonial India.

On 15 April 1980, Punjab &amp; Sind Bank was among six banks that the Government of India nationalised in the second wave of nationalisation (the first wave had been in 1969 when the government nationalised the top 14 banks).

In the 1960s, Punjab &amp; Sind Bank established a branch in London. In 1991 Bank of Baroda acquired Punjab &amp; Sind Bank&#x27;s London branch at the behest of the Reserve Bank of India following Punjab &amp; Sind&#x27;s involvement in the Sethia fraud in 1987.

Since 2004, the bank has shown growth of over 40% year on year, and its IPO was oversubscribed by more than 50 times.

On 16 July 2019, Punjab &amp; Sind Bank disclosed that it detected a fraud, worth by the Bhushan Power &amp; Steel Limited.

A member of historical confederacies, it joined the Confederation of the Rhine after the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, later joining the German Confederation after Napoleon was defeated in 1815. From 1871, it was part of the German Empire. It became a free state in the era of Weimar Republic in 1918 after the end of World War I and the abdication of King Frederick Augustus III of Saxony. Its capital was the city of Dresden, and its modern successor state is the Free State of Saxony.

==History==
===Napoleonic era and the German Confederation===

Before 1806, Saxony was part of the Holy Roman Empire, a thousand-year-old entity that had become highly decentralised over the centuries. The rulers of the Electorate of Saxony of the House of Wettin had held the title of elector for several centuries. The Holy Roman Empire was dissolved in August 1806 following the defeat of Emperor Francis II by Napoleon at the Battle of Austerlitz, thereby rendering Saxony an independent state. Following the defeat of Saxony&#x27;s ally Prussia at the Battle of Jena in October 1806, Saxony joined the Confederation of the Rhine, subordinating itself to the First French Empire, then the dominant power in Central Europe. On 20 December 1806 Frederick Augustus III, the last elector of Saxony, became King Frederick Augustus I.

In 1807 the Treaties of Tilsit ceded the , formerly a collection of Prussian enclaves within Saxon Lower Lusatia, to Saxony. The treaties also established the Polish Duchy of Warsaw, which was placed in a personal union with Saxony under Frederick Augustus I.

Saxony remained within the Confederation until its dissolution in 1813 with Napoleon&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Leipzig. Following the battle, in which Saxony – virtually alone of all the German states – had fought alongside the French, King Frederick Augustus I was deserted by his troops, taken prisoner by the Prussians, and considered to have forfeited his throne by the allies, who put Saxony under Prussian occupation and administration. This was probably more due to the Prussian desire to annex Saxony than to any crime on Frederick Augustus&#x27;s part, and the fate of Saxony would prove to be one of the main issues at the Congress of Vienna.

In the end, 60% of the kingdom, including the historically significant Wittenberg – home of the Protestant Reformation and historic core of the Electorate – as well as Lower Lusatia, most of Upper Lusatia, the and the , among other territories, was annexed by Prussia; most of the Neustadt Circle was re-ceded to Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach by Prussia. Within Prussia most of the ceded territory other than Lusatia would become part of the new Province of Saxony; the Upper Lusatian territory was attached to Silesia and the remainder, including Lower Lusatia, became part of Brandenburg. Frederick Augustus was restored to the throne in the remainder of his kingdom, which still included the major cities of Dresden and Leipzig. On the whole, the kingdom had lost about 60% of its land and 40% of its population. The kingdom also joined the German Confederation, the new organization of the German states to replace the fallen Holy Roman Empire.

===Austro-Prussian War and the German Empire===

During the 1866 Austro-Prussian War, Saxony sided with Austria, and the Royal Saxon Army was generally seen as the only ally to bring substantial aid to the Austrian cause, having abandoned the defence of Saxony itself to join up with the Austrian army in Bohemia. This effectiveness probably allowed Saxony to escape the fate of other north German states allied with Austria – notably the Kingdom of Hanover – which were annexed by Prussia after the war. The Austrians and French insisted as a point of honour that Saxony must be spared, and the Prussians acquiesced. Saxony nevertheless joined the Prussian-led North German Confederation the next year. With Prussia&#x27;s victory over France in the Franco-Prussian War of 1871, the members of the confederation were organised by Otto von Bismarck into the German Empire, with Wilhelm I as its emperor. John, as Saxony&#x27;s incumbent king, had to accept the Emperor as , although he, like the other German princes, retained some of the prerogatives of a sovereign ruler, including the ability to enter into diplomatic relations with other states.

===End of the kingdom===

Wilhelm I&#x27;s grandson Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated in 1918 as a result of a revolution set off in the days before Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I. King Frederick Augustus III of Saxony followed him into abdication when workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; councils were set up in the cities of Dresden, Chemnitz and Leipzig. Within the newly formed Weimar Republic, on 1 November 1920, the Kingdom of Saxony was reorganized into the Free State of Saxony

==Governance==
===1831 Constitution===
The 1831 Constitution of Saxony established the state as a parliamentary monarchy.

====King====
The king was named as head of the nation. He was required to follow the provisions of the constitution, and could not become the ruler of any other state (save by blood inheritance) without the consent of the Diet, or parliament. The crown was hereditary in the male line of the royal family through agnatic primogeniture, though provisions existed allowing a female line to inherit in the absence of qualified male heirs. Added provisions concerned the formation of a regency if the king was too young or otherwise unable to rule, as well as provisions concerning the crown prince&#x27;s education.

Any acts or decrees signed or issued by the king had to be countersigned by at least one of his ministers, who thus took responsibility for them. Without the ministerial countersignature, no act of the king was to be considered valid. The king was given the right to declare any accused person innocent, or alternately to mitigate or suspend their punishment or pardon them (but not to increase penalties); such decrees did not require ministerial co-signature. He was also given supreme power over religious matters in Saxony. He appointed the president of the upper house of the Diet, together with a proxy from among three candidates suggested by that house, and appointed the president and proxy of the lower house, as well. (See below.)

The king was given sole power to promulgate laws, and to carry them into effect, and only by his consent could any proposal for a law be advanced in the Diet. He equally had authority to issue emergency decrees and even to issue non-emergency laws that he found needful or &quot;advantageous&quot;, though such instruments required the counter-signature of at least one of his ministers, and had to be presented to the next Diet for approval. He could not, however, change the constitution itself or the electoral laws in this manner. He was permitted to veto laws passed by the Diet (though he was required to give his reasons for so doing, in each instance), or to send them back with proposed amendments for reconsideration. He was permitted to issue extraordinary decrees to obtain money for state expenditures refused by the Diet, through the Supreme Court, though such decrees could only last for one year. He was permitted to dissolve the Diet, though new elections for the lower house had to be held within six months; he was also permitted to convoke extraordinary sessions of the legislature at his discretion.

From 1697 the Electors of Saxony became Catholic in order to accept the crowns of Poland-Lithuania, of which they were kings until 1763. The royal family remained Roman Catholic, ruling over a domain that was 95% Protestant.

====Ministry====
The ministry was defined in the constitution as consisting of six departments, all of which were made responsible to the Diet:

*The Chief Court of Justice;
*The Court of Finance;
*The Office For the Affairs of the Interior;
*The War Office;
*The Ecclesiastical Court;
*The Office of Foreign Affairs.

Members of the ministry had the right to appear in either chamber of the Diet at will, and there to participate in debate, but upon a division of the house they had to withdraw.

====Bill of Rights====
A Bill of Rights was included in the constitution. It incorporated:

*Protections for &quot;liberty of person and right over his own property is without limit except that which law and justice dictates&quot; (Section 27); 
*The right of a citizen to choose any lawful profession and to emigrate so long as no military or civil obligations attached to them (Sections 28–29); 
*The right to be paid for expropriated property and to challenge the amount of payment set by the state in court (Section 31); 
*Liberty of conscience and religion (Section 32), though freedom of religion was limited to Christian churches recognized by the state (Section 56); 
*Equality for members of state-recognized religious organizations (Section 33); 
*Equality in eligibility for government employment (Section 34); 
*A limited freedom of the press, subject to legal restrictions (Section 35);
*The right to appeal actions of government officials either to the courts or to the Diet itself (Section 36);
*The right to directly appeal grievances to the King himself (Section 36);
*Freedom from arbitrary arrest and punishment save through conviction in a court of law (Section 51);
*No person was to be confined for more than 24 hours without being informed of the reason for his arrest (Section 51);
*The right to be free of all taxes other than those prescribed by law or title (Section 37).

====Legislature====
The Diet, or legislature was divided into two houses, which were constitutionally equal in their rights and status, and neither house was to meet without the other.

The upper chamber consisted of the following:

*All princes of the blood who were of legal age (defined as 19, in the constitution);
*One deputy of the Bishopric of Misnia (Meißen);
*The proprietor of the Principality of Wildenfels;
*One deputy representing the five Schönburg family domains;
*One deputy from the University of Leipzig, chosen by the professors of that institution;
*The proprietor of the Barony of Königsbrück;
*The proprietor of the Barony of Riebersdorf;
*The minister (Court preacher) of the Lutheran court chapel;
*The dean of the Roman Catholic Collegiate Church of St. Peter in Budessen/Bautzen;
*The superintendent of the town of Leipzig;
*One deputy from the Lutheran Cathedral of Wurzen;
*One deputy representing four other Schönburg family estates;
*Twelve proprietors of manorial estates in the kingdom, possessed of a minimum income of at least $2000 per year from rentals, chosen for life from amongst themselves;
*Ten more persons of the proprietary class, possessed of a minimum income of at least $4000 per year from rentals, chosen by the king for life;
*The chief magistrate of Dresden and Leipzig;
*Six other town magistrates chosen by the king, with the provision that the monarch should try to see that all sections of the kingdom were represented.

Members of this house held their seats so long as they remained qualified to do so under the constitution, or in certain cases until they had reached the age of sixty or participated in three sessions of the Diet.

The lower house of the Diet consisted of:

*Twenty proprietors of manorial estates, possessed of rental income of at least $600 per year;
*Twenty-five deputies from towns;
*Twenty-five deputies chosen from among the peasants;
*Five representatives of trades and factories.

A proxy was to also be chosen for each representative, who would take the representative&#x27;s place, should they be incapacitated, absent, resign or be removed. Each representative was elected for nine years; however, approximately one-third were required to resign their seats every three years (the exact figures were set in the constitution, and determined by lot at the commencement of the first session of the Diet), though all were eligible for immediate re-election. The lower house was to nominate four members, of whom the king was to choose one to be president of that house, and another to be his proxy.

Members of the Diet must be at least 30 years of age; electors must be 25 years of age, not have been convicted of any offense in a court of law, not have their personal estate financially encumbered in any way, and not be under guardianship.

The Diet was required to consider any business laid before it by the king, before proceeding to any other business. Members were to vote their consciences, and were not to accept instructions from their constituents. Members were granted full freedom of speech in the chambers, but were not permitted to insult each other, the king, any member of the royal family, or the parliament. Members who violated any of these rules could be disciplined by their respective house, up to and including permanent expulsion with ineligibility for re-election. The Diet could propose the formation of new laws or changes in existing ones, but no bill could be brought forward without the king&#x27;s express consent. Conversely, no new law could be enacted, without the Diet&#x27;s consent.

Bills could be passed by a simple one-third-plus-one vote in both houses of the Diet; a majority vote was not necessary in either house. Any bill rejected or amended must contain a statement of why it was rejected or amended. No new taxes could be imposed without the Diet&#x27;s consent, though the king was permitted to bypass this in certain instances. The parliament could impeach members of the ministry by unanimous vote of both houses; ministers so impeached were to be tried by a special court; the decision of this court was final, and even the king&#x27;s right of pardon did not extend to persons convicted by it.

In the wake of the tumultuous 1848 revolutions, Saxony&#x27;s Landtag extended voting rights (though still maintaining property requirements) and abolished voting taxes. In 1871, Saxony was incorporated into the German Empire and more voting rights were gradually extended. By the early 1900s, Saxony&#x27;s local politics had settled into a niche in which Social Democrats, Conservatives, and National Liberals were splitting the share of votes and Landtag seats three ways. (In 1909: Social Democrats won 27% of seats, Conservatives won 31% of seats, National Liberals won 31% of seats). Voter participation was high (82% in 1909).

====Judiciary====
The judiciary was made independent of the civil government. The High Court of Judiciature, created in Sections 142 to 150, was also given authority to rule upon &quot;dubious&quot; points in the constitution; its decision was decreed to be final, and was protected from royal interference.

====Administrative reorganisation====

Following the adoption of the 1831 constitution, by the Order of April 6, 1835 district directorates () were established. These were subsequently known as . Originally there were four:
* Kreishauptmannschaft Bautzen
* Kreishauptmannschaft Dresden
* Kreishauptmannschaft Leipzig
* Kreishauptmannschaft Zwickau
In 1900 a fifth was added:
* Kreishauptmannschaft Chemnitz

===Reichstag deputies 1867 to 1918===

Following the North German Confederation Treaty, the Kingdom of Saxony entered the North German Confederation in 1866. As a consequence, the kingdom returned deputies to the Reichstag. After the founding of the German Empire on 18 January 1871, the deputies were returned to the Reichstag of the German Empire. Following this Saxony participated in Reichstag elections from February 1867. Zittau returned a series of Reichstag deputies until 1919 when the existing constituencies were scrapped.

<text>The son of Gorbonianus was a legendary king of the Britons as recounted by Geoffrey of Monmouth. He was a son of King Gorbonianus but was never given a name in the text. He came to power in 305BC. 

According to Geoffrey, he was a good and prudent king who emulated his uncle and predecessor, Elidurus. He was just and compassionate to his people and never faltered in his righteousness to them. When he died, he was succeeded by his cousin, Marganus, the son of Archgallo.

In Layamon&#x27;s Brut by Layamon he is named as Lador, but rules for a short time.

<text>Ralph Bunche Park is a small municipal public park in the Turtle Bay neighborhood of New York City, on the west side of First Avenue between 42nd and 43rd Streets. Originally referred to as United Nations Plaza Park, it was named in 1979 for Ralph Bunche, the first African-American to win the Nobel Peace Prize. The park contains four monuments: a sculpture dedicated to Ralph Bunche, a wall inscribed with a biblical quotation from the prophet Isaiah, a staircase named in honor of Natan Sharansky, and a plaque commemorating Bayard Rustin.

The park was dedicated as the city&#x27;s first Peace Park in 1985. Because of its proximity to the United Nations headquarters and peace theme, the site is a popular site for demonstrations and rallies for peace and other international issues; however, it cannot accommodate major gatherings as it covers less than .

==History==

=== 1940s to 1970s ===
The site of the park, which is located on the west side of First Avenue between 42nd and 43rd streets (across from the United Nations headquarters), was previously occupied by a three-story garage that abutted the east side of the base of Prospect Tower in Tudor City. The new parkland, including the property for Trygve Lie Plaza on the opposite side of 42nd Street, was acquired by the city as part of the widening of First Avenue to accommodate the United Nations headquarters, which included the construction of the vehicular tunnel that runs under First Avenue from 42nd to 48th streets.

Construction of a park at this location was opposed by William Zeckendorf and his real estate development firm Webb &amp; Knapp, which had planned to construct an airline terminal building on a portion of the block, including the site of the Hospital for Special Surgery (which was planning to move to a new building on the Upper East Side). Zeckendorf called the plans to construct a park that could not be extended due to the cliff supporting the Tudor City buildings &quot;a flagrant misuse of City funds.&quot; Webb &amp; Knapp owned the property on First Avenue and planned to use the site part of the airline terminal to provide access for limousines traveling to the terminal and the Queens–Midtown Tunnel, and intended to connect it to a large building on Second Avenue via a tunnel under Tudor City. During that time period, many airlines provided ticketing, baggage, and airport ground transportation services at remote terminals located in Manhattan, including the 42nd Street Airlines Terminal that opened in 1941 across from Grand Central Terminal.

The boundaries of the park were outlined on a map as early as 1947; the land lot has an area of , with a frontage of and a depth of . The stretch of First Avenue above the tunnel and adjacent to the park was renamed &quot;United Nations Plaza&quot; in 1952.

The granite spiral staircase in the park&#x27;s northwest corner leads to 43rd Street and the Tudor City apartments. It was designed by the firm of Andrews &amp; Clark and replaced a set of stairs that had previously connected Tudor City with First Avenue at 43rd Street. The staircase was built and dedicated in 1948 during construction of the U.N. headquarters and has the famous quotation from Isaiah 2:4: &quot;They shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more&quot; incised into its wall. Known as the Isaiah Wall, it was rededicated in 1975 and had the name &quot;Isaiah&quot; added under the final word.
The effort to add the word &quot;Isaiah&quot; to the wall was led by Sam Brown, a former official of the American Jewish Congress. Brown wrote letters to New York City Mayor Abraham Beame and United Nations Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim in May 1974 about the omission and was ultimately directed to the city&#x27;s Parks, Recreation &amp; Cultural Affairs Administration, which said inscription could be added if he paid for it because city funds for the work were not available. Brown enlisted the assistance of the &quot;Indiana Jewish Post and Opinion&quot; to help raise funds for the project from its readers in the beginning of 1975. The inscription was added in consultation with the city&#x27;s Landmarks Preservation Commission. The original inscription consisted of letters that had been carved into the granite by the A. Ottavino Corporation; the same firm added &quot;Isaiah&quot; to the inscription in September 1975.

On February 5, 1976, the New York City Council Committee on Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs passed a bill to name the park &quot;Zion Square.&quot; The legislation was sponsored by Councilman Henry Stern and came as a response to United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379 that had been recently adopted by the international organization. Opponents of the name change included M. T. Mehdi and Alfred Lilienthal. An editorial in &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the bill to name the park &quot;an inane response.&quot; The following week, it was disclosed that the city&#x27;s Art Commission and Parks, Recreation &amp; Cultural Affairs Administration had approved the site in 1973 as the location for a monument to Ralph Bunche, which came as a surprise to both those that supported and opposed naming the park &quot;Zion Square.&quot; Officially naming the park would have required approval by the full city council and mayor; the committee never brought the bill to the full city council for a vote.

Meanwhile, an international committee was formed to raise funds for the monument to Ralph Bunche planned for the park, which was then referred to as &quot;United Nations Plaza Park.&quot; U.S. Representative Charles Rangel introduced legislation authorizing the appropriation of funds for the monument in 1978; he subsequently introduced a bill authorizing appropriations for the monument to be used by the Phelps Stokes Fund, which was passed by Congress and signed into law in 1980. The City Council&#x27;s Committee on Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs ended up passing a bill to name the park in memory of Ralph Bunche on July 30, 1979, and legislation establishing &quot;Ralph J. Bunche Park&quot; was signed into law by New York City Mayor Ed Koch on October 9, 1979.

In February 1979, Harry Helmsley proposed constructing a 50-story apartment building at the site, swapping ownership of the park with the city in exchange for converting the private parks in Tudor City into public parks (which Helmsley had planned to develop with buildings). The plan ran into opposition from community groups and elected officials and two months later Helmsley changed his proposal to instead swap ownership of the city-owned park at the southeast corner of First Avenue and 42nd Street (now called Robert Moses Playground) to build the proposed skyscraper.

=== 1980s to present ===
&quot;Peace Form One&quot;, a stainless-steel obelisk high, was erected in September 1980 in the plaza in front of the Isaiah Wall. The sculptor, Daniel LaRue Johnson, was a personal friend of Bunche and dedicated the sculpture to Bunche when the latter won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1950. The sculpture was dedicated on September 15, 1980 with a ceremony held at the United Nations General Assembly Building followed by an unveiling of a plaque near the base of the monument in the park. Dignitaries attending the event included Mrs. Ralph J. Bunche, United Nations Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim, U.S. Vice President Walter Mondale, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Donald McHenry, U.S. Representative Charles Rangel, U.S. Representative William Green and Mayor Ed Koch.

In 1981 the staircase adjacent to the Isaiah Wall was named the Sharansky Steps in honor of Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky. Legislation to name the staircase after Sharansky was passed by the City Council on September 24, 1981 and was signed into law by Mayor Ed Koch on October 6, 1981. Koch dedicated the staircase in a ceremony held on November 1, 1981 that was sponsored by the Greater New York Conference on Soviet Jewry and the Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry.

In February 1982, Israeli ambassador to the United Nations Yehuda Blum said that he wanted the city to consider removing the inscription on the Isaiah Wall. His request came during the debate at an emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly that resulted in a resolution calling for a boycott of Israel following its Golan Heights Law and was followed up with a phone call to Mayor Ed Koch. Koch rejected his request, but said he would instead add a new biblical quotation to the wall that would reflect the &quot;hypocrisy&quot; of the United Nations. Koch changed his mind later that month and decided against adding a new inscription to the wall.

The tradition of egg balancing on the vernal equinox gained widespread publicity after urban shaman Donna Henes stood 360 eggs on their ends at the park around 11:39 p.m. on March 20, 1983. The event was attended by about a hundred people and covered in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;; staff writer William McKibben was able to get an egg to balance on his first try during the equinox but failed repeatedly when he returned to the site two days later.

Ralph Bunche Park was dedicated as the city&#x27;s first Peace Park by Mayor Ed Koch on August 14, 1985, the 40th anniversary of the end of World War II. The designation was inspired by the efforts of Ploughshares, a Seattle-based organization consisting of former Peace Corps volunteers, to create a binational peace park between the United States and Soviet Union with the support of Architects/Designers/Planners for Social Responsibility. Ploughshares had asked mayors in the United States to lobby Moscow Mayor Vladimir Promyslov to provide a site for the proposed peace park in his city, and Koch decided it would be a good idea to create a peace park in New York City after he was contacted by Seattle mayor Charles Royer to help support Ploughshares&#x27; initiative.

On August 28, 1989, Mayor Ed Koch dedicated a plaque at the southern end of the park that commemorates American civil rights leader Bayard Rustin.
In the early to mid-1990s, the Grand Central Partnership developed plans to designate the segment of 43rd Street between First and Lexington avenues, which includes the Sharansky Steps at the north end of the park, as &quot;United Nations Way&quot; and make streetscape improvements along the corridor to provide an enhanced pedestrian connection between the United Nations headquarters and Grand Central Terminal. Flags of the member states of the United Nations were added to the lampposts along 43rd Street in October 1995 to mark the 50th anniversary of the international organization. The street provides access to the nearest New York City Subway station to the park, the Grand Central–42nd Street station (served by the ), Metro-North Railroad at Grand Central Terminal, and the Long Island Rail Road at Grand Central Madison.

==Protests and demonstrations==
Because of its proximity to the United Nations, the peace theme of the Isaiah Wall and &quot;Peace Form One&quot;, and Bunche&#x27;s career as a peacemaker, the park is a popular site for demonstrations and rallies for peace and other international issues. The small size of the park, which covers less than , cannot accommodate major gatherings of more than 50 people. It is also closed as a security measure during the general debate of the United Nations General Assembly. Larger events are accommodated at Dag Hammarskjöld Plaza, the only other location near the United Nations headquarters were protests and demonstrations with sound are permitted.

<text>Robert Guy Newton (1 June 1905 – 25 March 1956) was an English actor. Along with Errol Flynn, Newton was one of the more popular actors among the male juvenile audience of the 1940s and early 1950s, especially with British boys. Known for his hard-living life, he was cited as a role model by the actor Oliver Reed and the Who&#x27;s drummer Keith Moon.

Beginning his career in theatre in the 1920s, Newton appeared in numerous plays in the West End, including &quot;Bitter Sweet&quot; by Noël Coward. In 1939 he was Horatio in &quot;Hamlet&quot; at the Old Vic theatre opposite Laurence Olivier&#x27;s Prince Hamlet. After serving in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, he had his major break on screen playing the lead in &quot;This Happy Breed&quot; (1944) and starring in Olivier&#x27;s version of &quot;Henry V&quot; (1944). These appearances saw British exhibitors vote him the 10th most popular British film star of 1944.

Newton is best remembered for his portrayal of the feverish-eyed Long John Silver in the 1950 RKO-Disney British adaptation of &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, the film that became the standard for screen portrayals of historical pirates. He starred as Edward Teach (Blackbeard) in &quot;Blackbeard the Pirate&quot; in 1952 and Long John Silver again in the 1954 film of the same title, which spawned a miniseries in the mid-1950s. Born in Dorset in the West Country of England and growing up in Cornwall near Land&#x27;s End, his exaggeration of his West Country accent is credited with popularising the stereotypical &quot;pirate speech&quot;. Newton has become the &quot;patron saint&quot; of the annual International Talk Like a Pirate Day.

==Early life==
Robert Guy Newton was born on 1 June 1905 in Shaftesbury, Dorset, a son of the landscape painter Algernon Newton, R.A. He lived with his family in Lamorna near Penzance, Cornwall, from 1912 to 1918. He attended St. Petroc&#x27;s preparatory school in Bude, where he won a shooting competition in 1916, and then Exeter School and St. Bartholomew&#x27;s School in Newbury, Berkshire.

==Early career==
His acting career began at the age of 16 at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in 1921. He appeared in many repertory shows until he went to Canada where he worked on a cattle ranch for a year.

He returned to England and performed in many plays in the West End of London, including &quot;Bitter Sweet&quot; by Noël Coward, &quot;The Letter&quot; with Gladys Cooper, and &quot;Cardboard Lover&quot; with Tallulah Bankhead. He also appeared in &quot;Private Lives&quot; on Broadway, taking over the role from his friend Laurence Olivier. From 1932 to 1934, he was the manager of the Shilling Theatre in Fulham, London. He had a small role in the film &quot;Reunion&quot; (1932).

Newton was put under contract to Alexander Korda who cast him in small roles in the cinema films &quot;Fire Over England&quot; (1937), &quot;Dark Journey&quot; (1937), &quot;Farewell Again&quot; (1937) and &quot;The Squeaker&quot; (1937). He also had a part as Cassius in the abandoned version of &quot;I, Claudius&quot; and in &quot;21 Days&quot; (shot in 1937, released 1940). Newton was borrowed by 20th Century Fox for &quot;The Green Cockatoo&quot; (1937). Newton had a good role supporting Charles Laughton in &quot;Vessel of Wrath&quot; (1938). He had another strong part in &quot;Yellow Sands&quot; (1939) and had his first film lead in &quot;Dead Men are Dangerous&quot; (1939). He made another with Laughton, &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot; (1939), playing the romantic male lead, directed by Alfred Hitchcock. In 1939, he played Horatio to Laurence Olivier&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; at the Old Vic, in a production that included Alec Guinness and Michael Redgrave. Newton kept busy as a film actor, appearing in &quot;Poison Pen&quot; (1939) and &quot;Hell&#x27;s Cargo&quot; (1939).

Newton continued primarily as a supporting actor in films, appearing in &quot;Gaslight&quot; (1940), &quot;Busman&#x27;s Honeymoon&quot; (1940), &quot;Bulldog Sees It Through&quot; (1940), &quot;Channel Incident&quot; (1940) and &quot;Major Barbara&quot; (1941), directed by Gabriel Pascal from the play by George Bernard Shaw. Newton got another chance as a star in &quot;Hatter&#x27;s Castle&quot; (1942), opposite Deborah Kerr and James Mason. He consolidated his status by playing opposite Anna Neagle in the Amy Johnson biopic &quot;They Flew Alone&quot; (1942), playing Jim Mollison.

==Military service==
Newton enlisted in the Royal Navy and saw active service in the rank of an Able Seaman on board , which fought as an escort ship on several Russian convoys during World War II. After two and a half years in the Royal Navy he was medically discharged in 1943.

==Return to acting==
On resuming his film career, Newton played the lead in &quot;This Happy Breed&quot; (1944), a role played on stage by Noël Coward. Directed by David Lean, it was a huge hit. So too was the Laurence Olivier version of &quot;Henry V&quot; (1944), in which Newton played Ancient Pistol. These appearances helped British exhibitors vote him the 10th most popular British film star of 1944. During the war, he starred in the West End in &quot;No Orchids for Miss Blandish&quot;, which was a hit.

Newton had the star role in a thriller &quot;Night Boat to Dublin&quot; (1946), then had a showy cameo role in &quot;Odd Man Out&quot; (1947); this performance later was immortalised in Harold Pinter&#x27;s play &quot;Old Times&quot;. He stayed in leads for &quot;Temptation Harbour&quot; (1947) and &quot;Snowbound&quot; (1948). Lean cast him as Bill Sikes in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1948), a huge success critically and commercially.

==Hollywood==
He then made a series of films with Hollywood stars and/or financing: &quot;Kiss the Blood Off My Hands&quot; (1948), a &quot;film noir&quot; with Joan Fontaine and Burt Lancaster; &quot;Obsession&quot; (1949), a thriller directed by Edward Dmytryk, playing a cuckolded husband who exacts revenge on his wife. He played Long John Silver in Walt Disney&#x27;s version of &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1950), shot in the UK, with Bobby Driscoll and directed by Byron Haskin. Less well known is &quot;Waterfront&quot; (1950) in which Richard Burton appeared in his third film.

His final performance on stage was in the 1950 production of &quot;Gaslight&quot; with Rosamund John at the Vaudeville Theatre.
&quot;Treasure Island&quot;″s success prompted Newton to return to Hollywood. He was one of several British actors in &quot;Soldiers Three&quot; (1951), an Imperial adventure tale. He returned to Britain for &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s Schooldays&quot; (1951) to play Thomas Arnold, then was cast by 20th Century Fox as Javert in their version of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1952). In 1951, he was voted the sixth most popular British star in Britain.

Gabriel Pascal gave him the role of Ferrovius in &quot;Androcles and the Lion&quot; (1952), another Shaw adaptation. It was made by RKO who cast Newton in the title role of &quot;Blackbeard the Pirate&quot; (1952).

Fox asked him back for &quot;The Desert Rats&quot; (1953) opposite Richard Burton and James Mason, playing a drunken school teacher who discovers bravery during World War II. He was one of several names in an airplane disaster movie &quot;The High and the Mighty&quot; (1954). He was in an episode of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; playing a tramp blackmailing a business man.

Back in Britain, Newton was given the lead in &quot;The Beachcomber&quot; (1954), a remake of &quot;Vessels of Wrath&quot;, this time in the part originally played by Charles Laughton. He again played Long John Silver in an Australian-made film, &quot;Long John Silver&quot; (1954). It was shot at Pagewood Studios, Sydney, and directed by Byron Haskin, who had directed &quot;Treasure Island&quot;. The company went on to make a 26-episode 1955 TV series, &quot;The Adventures of Long John Silver&quot;, in which Newton also starred. Earlier in 1954, he quit the film &quot;Svengali&quot; for personal reasons to be replaced by Sir Donald Wolfit which left him open to a legal action while filming in Australia in 1954.

His last screen appearance was as Inspector Fix in &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (1956) opposite David Niven, Shirley MacLaine and the Mexican star Cantinflas. It won the Academy Award for the Best Picture in 1956.

==Personal life==
Newton married four times and had three children.

He was accused of kidnapping his son, Nicholas, when he took him to Hollywood in 1951, the year his third marriage ended. After a court battle, Newton&#x27;s elder son was placed in the custody of his aunt and uncle.

He married his fourth wife, Vera Budnik, in June 1952. They had a son.

==Death==
Newton suffered in the latter part of his life from chronic alcoholism and died on 25 March 1956 at age 50, following a heart attack in Beverly Hills, California. His body was cremated, and there is a plaque in Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles in his memory. Years later his ashes were scattered into the south coast of Cornwall in Mount&#x27;s Bay, near Lamorna in Cornwall, where his father had spent his childhood.

<text>This is a list of professional and alternative format [[snooker]] tournaments. Professional snooker tournaments can take the form of ranking tournaments—which are open to players on the main tour and award ranking points based on a player&#x27;s performance—and non-ranking tournaments. A non-ranking tournament may take the form of an invitational event where player participation is conditional on criteria set by the organiser or sponsor or by personal invite. Most tournaments take the form of a &#x27;singles&#x27; event, but there are several team formats that have appeared on the calendar over the years.

In recent seasons alternative forms of snooker have proliferated on the calendar. Any event that uses the official rules of snooker but is not completely consistent with them is defined as an &quot;alternative form of snooker&quot;, such as six-red snooker (which is played with six reds as opposed to the standard fifteen as required by the official rules), and alterations to scoring and fouling. Some tournaments have occupied the middle ground between strict adherence to the official rules and adopting an alternative format by implementing tournament rules that fully complement the official rules of the game, such as adding a shot clock or ; in such instances, a tournament rule operates in a way that the official rules of the game are still fully observed.

<doc id="679266" wikidata="Q271864" url="?curid=679266" title="National anthem of Mongolia">
<text>The National Anthem of Mongolia, known before 1991 as the State Anthem of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic, was originally created in 1950 during the communist regime to replace the &quot;Mongol Internationale&quot;. The music was composed by Bilegiin Damdinsüren and Lubhsanjambiin Mördorj, and the lyrics were written by Tsendiin Damdinsüren.

==History==
Since the early 20th century, Mongolia has had two national anthems: the first, used between 1924 and 1950, was called the &quot;Mongol Internationale&quot;, with lyrics by Sonombaljiriin Buyannemekh and music by Magsarjabhiin Dugarjabh. It is often incorrectly listed as the Mongolian-language version of &quot;The Internationale&quot;, despite the two songs having almost nothing in common aside from similar titles. &quot;The Internationale&quot; does have a Mongolian version, however, which should not be confused with the &quot;Mongol Internationale&quot;.

The second anthem, by Damdinsüren and Mördorj, replaced the &quot;Mongol Internationale&quot; and has been in use since 1950. The lyrics were changed slightly in 1961 to include references to the Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party and remove references to various Soviet and Mongolian leaders; however, the original lyrics were restored in early 1991, a year prior to the end of the communist regime. Since 1991, most of the lyrics from 1950 have been in use again, but the second verse (praising Lenin, Stalin, Sükhbaatar and Choibalsan) has been removed. On 6 July 2006, the lyrics were revised by the Mongolian Parliament to commemorate Genghis Khan.

The current constitution of Mongolia mandates that the national anthem be broadcast daily on media channels prior to the end of transmissions.

<doc id="679275" wikidata="Q1338466" url="?curid=679275" title="Porsche 911 (997)">
<text>The Porsche 997 is the sixth generation of the Porsche 911 sports car manufactured and sold by the German automobile manufacturer Porsche. It was sold between 2004 (for the 2005 model year) and 2013. Production of the Carrera and Carrera S coupé began in early 2004, and the all-wheel drive Carrera 4 and Carrera 4S began to be delivered to customers in November 2005. Deliveries of the Turbo and GT3 derivatives were carried out in late 2006, along with the GT2 in 2007. In addition to the coupé and cabriolet versions, Targa versions of the Carrera 4 and Carrera 4S were also available, which continued the trend of the &quot;glass canopy&quot; roof design used since its first application in the 993 until the 991 generation. This was later reverted to the classic targa top layout used in earlier models of the 911 Targa. 

The 997 was an evolution of the preceding 996, with significant changes being made to the interior and exterior styling (the most notable of these being the replacement of the &quot;fried egg&quot; headlamps used in the 996 with the classic &quot;bug eye&quot; units). Larger 18-inch wheels were fitted as standard, and other engineering changes include slightly increased power; however, the car is technically very similar to its predecessor despite many revisions. A new S version was offered, with additional power from a slightly larger engine, a sports suspension, and sports exhaust.

During 2009, Porsche refreshed the 997 lineup, making styling changes, incorporating a new engine with direct injection, and introducing the company&#x27;s new &quot;PDK&quot; dual clutch transmission. As a result, the refreshed 997 models were faster, lighter, and more fuel efficient than the outgoing versions, with improved handling. In the case of the 997 Turbo, a comprehensively re-tuned all wheel drive system with ”torque vectoring&quot; as an option was also a part of the upgrades package; in an October 2009 preliminary review, &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine estimated that when equipped with the PDK transmission, the updated Turbo should be capable of accelerating from in three seconds.

The 997 received mostly positive reviews from the worldwide motoring press; even British motoring journalist Jeremy Clarkson, a known detractor of Porsche cars, remarked that the 997 will &quot;make love to your fingertips and stir your soul.&quot;

==First phase 997.1 (2004–2008)==

===History and development===

By February 1999, just a few months into the 997 development programme that began in the fourth quarter of 1998, designers were already at work on the 997&#x27;s body design. After numerous reviews during the rest of 1999 and full size clay models that were built from 2000 into 2001, a final design by designer Grant Larson was approved. Early prototypes were built in late 2001 for testing, based on newly set parameters. While the exterior styling was revised, it was very similar to what was observed in the 996. The rear bodywork was wider than its predecessor. However, the most notable aesthetic difference between the 997 and the 996 was the return to oval headlights like those of pre-996 Carreras, with separate indicator units. The interior was re-designed with new controls; however, it was more reminiscent of classic 911 interiors than of the outgoing 996. The body in general remained low profile with a drag coefficient of 0.28 for the Carrera and 0.29 for the Carrera S.

===Cabriolet===

For the first time, development of the cabriolet version of the 997 led the design and engineering effort at Porsche, with the coupé following. Porsche applied the logic that if you started with engineering challenges more unique to the cabriolet (for example, chassis stiffness), the coupé version would simply be more rigid. Despite additional weight, the cabriolet versions attain nearly the same performance figures as their coupé counterparts. Even the rear wing rises slightly higher on the cabriolets to compensate for differences in drag over the canvas top versus the smoother coupé shape. The 997 cabriolet had factory optional hard tops that provided better protection from unexpected weather conditions than the conventional canvas top. It is interchangeable with what is available in the late 996 cabriolet models. The hardtop also provides a winter option for cabriolet owners.

===911 Club Coupé (2005)===
The 911 Club Coupé is a limited (50 units) version of the 2006 Carrera S coupé with X51 Powerkit commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Porsche Club of America (PCA).

The vehicle included an Azurro California-colour scheme (similar to the colour found on the Porsche 356), a vehicle identification number (VIN) which ended with the production number and special commemorative badging and door sills, Sport Chrono Package Plus system, and optional Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes.

The car bearing chassis number #001 was transferred to the Porsche Museum in Stuttgart, Germany. One PCA member won the car bearing chassis number #050 in a sweepstakes drawing. The remaining 48 units were sold to randomly chosen U.S. and Canadian PCA members. After 2005-08-15, unsold units were made available to the general public.

The vehicle was unveiled in PCA&#x27;s 50th Annual Porsche Parade in Hershey, Pa.

The vehicle had an MSRP of US$99,911 or $145,911 CDN.

===Targa===

The Targa 4 and 4S versions were introduced in 2006. Like its predecessors, the 993 and 996, the 997 Targa is equipped with a glass roof system. At any speed, the roof can be opened where it drops down 25 mm and slides a metre back underneath the rear window. As the roof weighs an additional , the suspension has been modified as compared to the other Carrera models. When the glass roof is retracted, a small glass deflector is raised above the windshield to aid aerodynamic stability.

Unlike previous versions, the 997 Targa was only available with all-wheel drive. Targa 4 models are slightly slower than the hard top Carrera models because of the heavier roof and the all-wheel-drive system.

The 997 Targa became available in the fall of 2006 as a 2007 Model. In the first year, Porsche produced 1,760 cars worldwide (with 800 sold in the US market) out of the 38,922 911 models produced in total.

===Carrera S and 4S===

Following the success of the earlier 996 Carrera 4S, Porsche introduced the Carrera S in 2005 which had power output increased by as compared to the base Carrera.

The new all-wheel-drive Coupé, Cabriolet, and Targa versions were later available either in the S version alongside the Carrera with the following additional features:

*increased displacement of the engine (3.8 L vs 3.6 L) with increased power
*lowered suspension with PASM (Porsche Active Suspension Management, i.e. dynamically adjustable dampers)
*19-inch wheels
*upgraded braking system
*sports exhaust
*Bi-Xenon headlights
*aluminium trim in the interior

===Turbo===
The 997 Turbo debuted in February 2006 at the Geneva Motor Show. It featured a new front bumper with LED turn signal strips integrated in the air intakes; the fog lamps were moved to the corners of the bumpers. Large air vents fore and aft of the rear wheels provide other obvious visual cues of the Turbo model. The turbo utilises the wide body shell of the AWD models, giving it a more aggressive stance than the base 911 models. Also featured was a retractable rear wing, as used on the 996 Turbo along with air vents on the rear quarter panels in order for effective engine cooling. The 997 Turbo is lighter than its predecessor due to the extensive use of aluminium in key elements of the car.

The engine was based on the 911 GT1&#x27;s design and is rated at and ( at overboost) of torque. The torque is managed by Porsche Traction Management (PTM) system in conjunction with the Porsche Stability Management (PSM) system in order for a safer utilisation of the torque produced by the engine.

The engine uses two BorgWarner VTG turbochargers, a first for a Porsche production car. The turbochargers are fitted with a two-stage resonance intake system. The Variable Turbine Geometry incorporates guide vanes on the turbine wheel that change their angle of attack with exhaust speed, reducing turbo lag at low speeds while opening up to prevent excessive back pressure at high RPM.

The optional Sport Chrono package allows the 911 Turbo to overboost for ten seconds (1.0 bar to 1.2 bar), increasing peak torque over a narrow RPM range.

According to official Porsche figures, the 997 Turbo accelerates from a standstill in 3.9 seconds with the manual transmission, and 3.7 seconds with the 5-speed Tiptronic S transmission. Benchmark times to are 12.8 and 12.2 seconds, respectively. Maximum speed with either transmission is .

As an option, Porsche also offered its ceramic brake system, PCCB (Porsche Ceramic Composite Brake). The advantages of this high-tech material mean a reduction of compared to the standard brake system, excellent fade resistance owing to consistent friction values, and absolute corrosion resistance. The brakes were 380 mm diameter at the front and 350 mm at the rear.

====Turbo Cabriolet====

Porsche AG announced on 7 May 2007 that the 911 Turbo Cabriolet would go on sale in September 2007. The Porsche 997 Turbo Cabriolet became one of the fastest convertible sports cars in production. It is capable of similar top speeds and acceleration to the standard Porsche 997 turbo coupé, a notable feat due to the typical problems associated with convertible variants of hardtop coupés, such as the poor aerodynamics of a soft top, a lack of torsional rigidity, and the consequential weight increase from structural members.

===GT2===

The 996 GT2 was superseded by the 997 GT2, which went on sale in November 2007. At its release, the 997-generation Porsche 911 GT2 was the most powerful and fastest road-going 911 ever to have been sold to the public.

The GT2&#x27;s engine was based on the existing flat-6 engine, but features twin variable geometry turbochargers (as used on the 997 turbo), generating a maximum power output of at 6,500 rpm and of torque at 2,200 rpm. Unlike the 997 Turbo, the 997 GT2 uses a rear wheel drive layout for reduced weight (primarily for competing in GT2 class racing as with its predecessors), and boasts a power increase from a newly designed expansion intake manifold, and shorter turbo intake manifolds. Further, a full titanium exhaust system was fitted to the 997 GT2 contributing to reduced weight as compared to the turbo. Despite the power hike, Porsche claims fuel consumption at full throttle is improved by 15 percent compared with the 997 Turbo. The GT2 accelerates in 3.6 seconds to and in 7.4 seconds to and has top speed of . This makes it the first 911 to exceed the top speed barrier after the 1998 Porsche 911 GT1 Race Version (which is not considered to be an actual Porsche 911 due to its mid-mounted engine and overall shape). The Porsche 997 GT2 has a curb weight of . The only transmission available is a 6-speed manual.

The GT2 was the first Porsche equipped with launch control.

The appearance of the GT2 is slightly different from its sister-car, the 997 Turbo, in a few ways. It does away with fog lights in the front bumper and has integrated turn signals in the front air intakes, has a revised front lip, has a larger rear wing (with two small air scoops on either side), and has a different rear bumper (now featuring titanium exhaust pipes).

===GT3===

The GT3 variant debuted at the 2006 Geneva Motor Show alongside the 997 Turbo. Like previous GT3 models, it is a way for Porsche to homologate aerodynamic features for racing, as well as to offer race cars for customer teams. The 997 GT3 was priced at US$106,000. The engine has the same displacement as the Turbo, but does away with the turbochargers and uses a new variable intake system. The engine is rated at and of torque. It has an 8,400 rpm redline matching that of the Carrera GT flagship. The 3.6 L dry-sump engine does not suffer from the rear main seal problems of the earlier 3.6 L/3.8 L integrated dry-sump engines.

The GT3&#x27;s body work includes a special front bumper which increases cooling for the front-mounted radiators as well as a split spoiler at the rear. The GT3 also includes a special rear bumper and center tailpipes which draw heat away from the engine. The suspension system is lowered and the car utilises 30-series tyres and wheels. The car weighs .

The 997 GT3 is more driver-friendly than its predecessor, with &quot;comfort&quot; seats and the Porsche Communication Management system installed.

The special GT3 &quot;RS&quot; model came without many of the luxuries typically found in a Carrera to focus more on track-orientated driving (although the car is still road-legal). The RS trim was also available with a full roll cage and carbon fibre seats along with a large fixed rear wing to add to the &quot;race-car-for-the-road&quot; feel. The RS trim was introduced in Europe in October 2006; the North American release was in March 2007. A racing version of the GT3 RS debuted in 2007, called the 997 GT3 RSR.

The ratios on the six-speed transmission are closer, allowing the GT3 to reach in 4.1 seconds, while the RS accomplishes the same in exactly 4 seconds. The GT3 will continue to in 9.2 seconds and has a maximum top speed of .

===Engines===
&quot;*&quot; Models with turbocharged engines include Variable Turbine Geometry (VTG) turbochargers.

===General performance===
The base Carrera has essentially the same flat-6 (Boxer) engine from 996 Carrera. The Carrera S however uses a new flat-6 engine. The X51 Powerkit is available for S, 4S, Targa models, which increases engine power.

According to testing carried out by several American automotive publications, the Turbo model can accelerate from 0 to in about 3.4 seconds with an automatic transmission and 3.5 seconds with the manual transmission. The Carrera S model is capable of accelerating from in 4.7 seconds and can reach a top speed of , while the base Carrera model can accelerate from in 4.8 seconds, and can attain a top speed of .
The viscous clutch all wheel drive system sends between 5% and 40% of engine torque to the front wheels as per need.

The Porsche 997 GT3 RS and Porsche 997 Carrera 4S are tied for second fastest car in history, at , in the infamous moose test maneuver, beaten only by the &quot;Citroën Xantia Activa V6&quot; record of . The test is conducted by the magazine &quot;Teknikens Värld&#x27;s&quot; in Sweden, as a test of avoiding a moose in the road.

==Second phase 997.2 (2009–2013)==

The 997 received a mid-cycle refresh in 2008 for the 2009 model year. The updated model range was unveiled at the Paris Auto Show in September 2008. The updated Porsche 911 (called 997 Gen II internally at Porsche and 997.2 informally by enthusiasts) included the following changes:

*New engine with direct fuel injection. The engine is mounted lower in the tail section
*Revised suspension system
*Revised front bumper with larger air intakes
*Headlamps with LED daytime running lights and newly optional dual HID projectors
*Revised rear bumper with a new LED tail light design; AWD models included a reflective stripe between the tail lights
*Enlarged exterior mirrors
*Redesigned Porsche Sports Exhaust (PSE)
*Redesigned PCM system with touch-screen and optional hard-drive navigation and Bluetooth.
*New Porsche Doppelkupplungsgetriebe (PDK) transmission replacing the optional Tiptronic S.

Production of the 997 Gen II model began in late 2008. Initially available models included coupé and cabriolet versions of the Carrera, Carrera 4, Carrera S and Carrera 4S. Pricing was increased from the 997 Gen I; the base Carrera model was set to start at US$76,300 for North American buyers.

On 6 June 2008, these changes to the Porsche 911 were revealed on the Porsche website. The Turbo was not revealed until the Frankfurt Motor Show in September, thereafter the Turbo-based GT2 received the updated changes.
===Models===


Notes:
*MSRP prices are set to the United States. In Europe, prices are considerably higher and in some countries can even be double the price quoted for North American markets, mainly due to higher local tax rates.
*Integrated dry sump in all but GT3, GT3 RS, GT2 RS variants which have a dry sump with external oil reservoir and 7 pumps instead of only 3 in the less powerful versions.
*Integrated dry sump is Porsche&#x27;s name for a dry sump lubrication system integrated within the engine block, i.e. no separate oil reservoir.

===Targa (2009–2012)===

The updated Targa 4 and Targa 4S models were announced on 28 July 2008. The Targa now had a glass roof made of a special glass that repelled UV rays from entering the car. The engine in the Targa 4 was now uprated at while for the Targa 4S, power was increased to . The new Targa 4S has a top speed of and can accelerate from in 4.7 seconds, while the Targa 4 has a lower top speed.

===Turbo/Turbo Cabriolet (2010–2013)===

The refreshed version of the 997 Turbo was unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show. It received a completely new 6-cylinder, 3.8 litre boxer engine generating a maximum power output of and of torque ( with overboost) using revised BorgWarner variable turbine geometry (VTG) turbochargers. The new engine shared the construction of other 997 Gen II DFI engines. The 997 Gen I engine&#x27;s Nikasil cylinder liners were replaced with an Alusil block that combined the cylinders and crankcase into an integrated casting for each bank, thus reducing weight (in contrast to a separate cylinder block and crankcase for each bank). The dry sump lubrication system in the Turbo is different from other 911 models in that it uses integrated oil reservoirs at the bottom of the engine, separate from the crank case and utilises six oil pumps. The engine is configured with direct fuel injection and a compression ratio of 9.8:1. The intake manifold is a slightly larger unit, adopted from the outgoing GT2 along with slightly larger intake valves, wheels for the Turbochargers, and intercoolers. The exhaust system is also more refined and aids in the power increase while improving fuel economy. The overall result is an engine that is lighter than the previous engine and has a peak turbo-boost of 11.6 psi (a decrease from the outgoing model).

The suspension system was also revised and had new software to enhance handling. The BorgWarner all-wheel-drive system received new software for more linear delivery of power to the front wheels.

The Turbo was available with a manual transmission or the optional 7-speed PDK dual-clutch gearbox, which replaced the Tiptronic. With PDK and the optional sport-chrono package, which includes the availability of an electronically controlled launch control and an overboost-function for temporarily increasing the turbo-pressure, Porsche claimed the 911 turbo would accelerate from in 3.4 seconds and attain a top-speed of .
The model was also available with optional Porsche Torque Vectoring (PTV), which brakes the inner rear wheel to provide turning-torque through a curve reducing initial under steer. The look of the refreshed Gen II model was left mostly untouched from the 997 turbo Gen I. The taillights were updated to LED to match the 997 Gen II along with changes to the front lamps. The exhaust pipes were &quot;fatter&quot;, and the standard 19 in wheels received a new design. Thanks to revised dynamics the facelifted 997 can handle 1.3 g forces on a skid-pad according to Porsche.

Models equipped with the PDK also include an optional 3-spoke steering wheel with gearshift paddles as an alternative to the standard steering wheel with shift buttons.

Production versions went on sale in Germany in November 2009. European models had an MSRP of €122,400 for the Coupé and €131,800 for the Cabriolet (before tax).

====Turbo S (2010–2013)====

A more powerful version of the Turbo called the Turbo &quot;S&quot; (S standing for Sport) was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2010. European deliveries were scheduled for May 2010 with production ending in early 2013. Available only with the 7-speed PDK transmission, the engine in the Turbo S was tuned to generate an extra power output of more than the standard Turbo, bringing the total to at 6,000 rpm and of torque. The engine had revised intake valve timing and a new carbon fibre airbox installed to achieve this feat. The Turbo S also gained carbon-ceramic brakes and the Sport Chrono package as standard features. The Turbo S was Porsche&#x27;s fastest production car to date at the time of its introduction alongside the GT2 RS, having a acceleration time of 3.3 seconds and acceleration time of 10.8 seconds while ultimately reaching a maximum speed of . Maximum torque was available between 2,100 rpm and 4,250 rpm. The 911 Turbo S, by contrast to the regular Turbo, was configured to operate with a higher boost pressure level, which meant that maximum torque was available for an unlimited period.

===GT3 (2010–2012)===
The updated Porsche 911 GT3 was unveiled at the 2009 Geneva Motor Show, and became available in Europe starting in May, and in the US starting in October. The car now featured vents between the tail lights, a larger rear wing with &quot;3.8&quot; lettering on either side of the wing to denote the increase in engine displacement, forged pistons, lightweight valves and hollow camshafts in order to make the engine light weight, a special 6-speed manual transmission was the only transmission option with shorter gear ratios in order to feed optimum power to the rear wheels. Total downforce was doubled, and for the first time stability control was offered to help less experienced drivers. The new 3.8-litre flat-6 engine was now rated at at 7,600 rpm and at 6,250 rpm with a maximum engine speed of 8,500 rpm. The sport mode when activated, delivers an additional of torque to the rear wheels.

====Equipment====
The GT3 and GT3 RS were developed by Porsche&#x27;s Motorsport Division in Weissach. Sales began in September 2009 for all regions except China. Features included titanium double exhaust pipes, carbon fibre rear spoiler lip (Gurney flap) and rear lid ram air scoop, carbon fibre front above bumper air outlet and rear-view mirrors, aluminium 19in forged alloy wheels made specifically for the car with central locking nuts. The GT3 was available with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup tyres having a size of 235/35-19 at the front and 305/30-19 at the rear. A roll cage and a fire extinguisher was optional in the UK.

===GT3 RS (2010–2012)===

The GT3 RS is a high performance version of the GT3 with a higher engine power output, lower weight and shorter transmission ratios, as well as having upgraded body and suspension components, designed for homologating the race version of the 911 GT3. The engine was rated at at 7,900 rpm and at 6,750 rpm with a maximum engine speed of 8,500 rpm. The &quot;RS&quot; stands for &quot;rennsport&quot;, the German word for &quot;racing&quot; (literally, &quot;race sport&quot;).

The transmission has shorter ratios than found in the 911 GT3 for improved acceleration. Dynamic engine mounts are standard and serve to improve the car&#x27;s handling to an even higher level. Other features include PASM suspension, titanium connecting rods, a wider front and rear track, a large fixed rear wing made from carbon fibre, a standard roll cage, and corresponding decals.

Optional equipment included a lithium-ion battery, which is lighter than the stock lead-acid battery. The vehicle was unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show. The US model was set to go on sale in early spring of 2010 with an MSRP of US$132,800.

===GT3 Cup (2009)===

Unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show, the GT3 Cup is a Porsche Carrera Cup race car based on the 911 GT3 RS. It includes a wider rear body, lower front spoiler, rear wing (from the 911 GT3 Cup S race car), LED taillights, a racing exhaust system with a fully controlled catalytic converter (from Porsche Mobil1 Supercup cars), Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes. 9.5Jx18 front alloy wheels with 24/64-18 Michelin racing tyres and 12Jx18 alloy wheels with 27/68-18 tyres, additional Unibal joints on the track control arms and front and rear sword-shaped anti-roll bars with seven position settings each, an additional vent in the upper part of the front lid, steering wheel mounted Info Display with 6 switches.

Production model began delivery in 2009–2010. European model had a base MSRP of €149,850 (before tax).

===911 Sport Classic (2010–2011)===

Unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Auto show, the Sport Classic is a limited (250 units- all sold in under 48 hours) version of the 911 Carrera S coupé, inspired by the 1973 Carrera RS 2.7. The engine is rated at and features a newly developed resonance intake manifold with 6 vacuum-controlled switching flaps. It includes a 6-speed manual transmission, double-dome roof (informally called double bubble roof), wider rear fenders, SportDesign front apron with a front spoiler and a fixed &#x27;duck tail&#x27; rear wing (similar to the one found on the Carrera RS 2.7), Porsche Ceramic Composite Braking system (PCCB), lower PASM sports suspension, mechanical rear axle differential, 19-inch black Fuchs wheels, Porsche Exclusive woven leather seats and door panels, dashboard with Espresso Nature natural leather upholstery, and a specially developed Sport Classic Grey body colour.

Sales began in January 2010. European models had base MSRP of €169,300 (before tax).

===911 GT2 RS (2010)===

On 4 May 2010, the GT2 RS was publicly unveiled to the German Porsche dealers in Leipzig. The 3.6 litre twin-turbocharged Flat-6 engine in the GT2 RS develops and of torque and weighs less than the outgoing GT2. This allows it to be able to reach a top speed of and accelerate from in 3.5 seconds. It was the fastest and the most powerful 911 built of its generation.

According to Porsche Motorsports manager Andreas Preuninger, the RS was conceived around 2007 as a skunk-works effort. The 727 code number selected for the project corresponds to one of the Nissan GT-R&#x27;s lap times around the Nürburgring&#x27;s Nordschleife. When the dust settled, Porsche claimed that test driver Timo Kluck had supposedly eclipsed that target by nine seconds.

The GT2 has since then been an RS model only with no standard (non-RS) variant available.

===911 Carrera GTS and Carrera 4 GTS (2010–2011)===

In 2011, Porsche launched a new, mid-level 911 coming in above the Carrera and below the GT3. Ranging from $103,100 to US$112,900, the Carrera GTS was available as both a coupé and cabriolet, the car gets a wider body and track – the only Carrera variant with a wide track that is also rear wheel drive. The car also has an upgraded 3.8-litre engine generating a maximum power output of . The Carrera 4 GTS equipped with all-wheel-drive was unveiled in May 2011. In addition to the AWD system, the Carrera 4 GTS can be identified by a distinct reflective stripe between the tail lights. All GTS vehicles came standard with center lock wheels, Alcantara interior and other optional extras such as Porsche Sports Exhaust and PASM.

===911 Speedster (2011)===
In 2011, Porsche introduced a new 911 Speedster variant having a production run of 356 units only, the production number coming from the iconic car of the 1950s. It was the third production 911 Speedster made, preceded by the 1989 911 Carrera and 964 versions - the 993 generation didn&#x27;t have a regular production speedster variant and the 996 generation didn&#x27;t have a speedster variant at all. The Speedster was powered by the same engine as the Carrera GTS, which generated a maximum power output of , and was only offered with PDK as opposed to the &#x27;89 Speedster and 964 Speedster. It can accelerate from in 4.2 seconds to a top speed of around . Only two colours were offered, Pure Blue (which was developed specifically for the Speedster) and Carrera White. (Paint To Sample versions were produced in very limited numbers).

The Speedster featured a windscreen shorter than the standard 997 cabriolet while maintaining the same rake angle along with a familiar hump on the rear section to store the soft top.

===GT3 RS 4.0 (2011)===
In April 2011 Porsche revealed the final evolution of the 997, the 911 GT3 RS 4.0. It featured a 4.0-litre engine utilizing the crankshaft from the GT3 RSR with increased stroke dimensions (from 76.4 mm to 80.4 mm). This increased the power to output to at 8,250 rpm and of torque at 5,750 rpm. Chassis development was influenced by the GT2 RS and uses parts sourced from other RS 911 models. Front dive planes provided additional downforce up front. The car weighs in at , giving it a power-to-weight ratio of 370 PS per ton. Production was limited to only 600 cars.

===Transmissions===
All models include standard 6-speed manual transmission except for the Turbo S models and Speedster. The 7-speed PDK transmission was available in all but GT3, GT3 RS, GT3 Cup, GT3 RS 4.0, GT2, GT2 RS, and Sport Classic models. The PDK transmission features a Sport Plus setting that includes launch control and faster shifts.

==Marketing==
In June 2009, Porsche Cars North America partnered with five New York City street artists to unveil five graffiti-decorated Porsche 911 hoods in the Helenbeck Gallery. The hoods were sold to raise funds for CITYarts, a New York City-based organization whose mission is to bring children in contact with public artists.

==Mechanical Issues==
Porsche 997.1 and 997.2 models can suffer from cylinder bore scoring which occurs when there is a breakdown of the Al-Si Cylinder system. This results in wide areas of the cylinder walls having deep scratches or gouges with similar damage to the pistons. Engines with cylinder bore scoring will have poor piston ring seal and increased piston noise coupled with increased oil consumption. 997.1 models with the Lokasil engine block are more susceptible to this issue, however 997.2 models can also suffer from cylinder bore scoring, albeit at a much lower rate than its predecessor.

Although the 996 had issues with the intermediate shaft bearing and rear main seal, the 997.1 addressed these problem areas. IMS and RMS failures with the 997 are uncommon. Porsche used a larger, non-serviceable IMS bearing and these engines also received an updated PTFE rear main seal. To extend the life of the original IMS bearing, it is recommended to have the grease seal removed off the bearing to allow the engine oil to lubricate and cool the bearing.

<text>Richard Graves (4 May 1715 – 23 November 1804) was an English cleric, poet, and novelist. He is remembered especially for his picaresque novel &quot;The Spiritual Quixote&quot; (1773).

==Early life==
Graves was born at Mickleton Manor, Mickleton, Gloucestershire, to Richard Graves (1677–1729), an antiquary, and his Welsh wife Elizabeth, née Morgan. Morgan Graves (died 1770) of the Inner Temple, and the cleric Charles Caspar Graves, were his brothers.

Graves was educated first at a school run by William Smith, Curate at Mickleton from 1729, and then at John Roysse&#x27;s Free School in Abingdon (now Abingdon School). Smith&#x27;s well-read daughter Utrecia later formed part of his life, a relationship he broke off before her death in 1743.

==Oxford don==
Graves gained a scholarship at Pembroke College, Oxford, matriculating on 7 November 1732. George Whitefield was a servitor of Pembroke College, and they took their BA degree on the same day in July 1736. In the same year he was elected to a fellowship at All Souls College. Close for a time to Holy Club members, he retreated from the nascent Methodism of the group. He went to London to study medicine, attended the lectures of Dr Frank Nicholls on anatomy, but fell ill. His brother Charles Caspar Graves, on the other hand, was for a time close to the Wesleys.

Returning to Oxford, Graves took his master&#x27;s degree in 1740, and was ordained. He was appointed to the curacy of Tissington in Derbyshire by William Fitzherbert of Tissington Hall, a colleague at the Inner Temple of his elder brother Morgan Graves. For three years Graves was the family chaplain at the Hall, where he rambled through the district later described in his major novel. After resigning this charge, he made a tour in the north, and at Scarborough met a distant relative, Samuel Knight, Archdeacon of Berkshire. Knight obtained for him the curacy of Aldworth, near Reading, Berkshire, where he was in residence in 1744. The parsonage was out of repair, so that he lived in the house of a gentleman farmer, Mr Bartholomew of Dunworth, whose daughter he married.

Graves&#x27;s marriage meant that he automatically ceased to be a Fellow of All Souls in January 1749.

==Later life==
For a period, Graves was short of money. Through the interest of Sir Edward Harvey of Langley, near Uxbridge, he was presented in 1748 by William Skrine as rector of Claverton, near Bath, Somerset. He was inducted in July 1749, came into residence in 1750, and until his death never left the living for long.

Ralph Allen obtained for Graves in 1763 the adjoining vicarage of Kilmersdon, and also found him an appointment as chaplain to Mary Townshend, Countess Chatham. About 1793 he took the rectory of Croscombe, also in Somerset, but held it temporarily. He purchased the advowson of Claverton from Allen&#x27;s representatives in 1767, but later resold it to them. The old rectory house had been built in part by Allen in 1760, but it was enlarged by Graves.

Graves for 30 years took pupils, whom he educated with his own children. Until his parsonage house was enlarged he rented from Mrs. Warburton for sixty pounds a year the large house at Claverton, and &quot;the great gallery-library was turned into a dormitory&quot;. Through his preferments and teaching he gradually prospered, and among his purchases was the manor of Combe in Combe Monckton, Somerset. He reportedly, at nearly 90, walked almost daily to Bath. He was a Whig in politics, who mixed widely in society, was a frequent guest of Allen or the Warburtons at Prior Park, and &quot;contributed to the vase&quot;, taking part in the literary circle at Anna, Lady Miller&#x27;s house at Batheaston. Shenstone paid him repeated visits at Claverton, between 1744 and 1763.

Graves died on 23 November 1804, and was buried in the parish church on 1 December. A mural tablet was placed there to his memory.

==Associations==
Among Graves&#x27;s college friends were William Blackstone, Richard Jago, William Hawkins: and William Shenstone, who became a close friend. Graves later wrote &quot;Recollections&quot; of Shenstone. The fourth elegy by Shenstone is &quot;Ophelia&#x27;s Urn. To Mr. G——&quot; (i.e. Graves), and the eighth elegy is also addressed &quot;To Mr. G——, 1745&quot;. Letters from Shenstone to Graves are in vol. iii. of the former&#x27;s &quot;Works&quot;; a letter addressed to Mr. —— on his marriage, written 21 August 1748, may refer to Graves. In the &quot;Works&quot;, ii. 322–3, are &quot;To William Shenstone at the Leasowes by Mr. Graves&quot;,’ and &quot;To Mr. R. D. on the death of Mr. Shenstone&quot;, signed &quot;R. G.&quot;

At Tissington Hall, Graves made the acquaintance of Charles Pratt, Sir Edward Wilmot, Nicholas Hardinge, and other notable persons. He served as private tutor to Prince Hoare and Thomas Malthus. He was a close friend of Anthony Whistler, Ralph Allen, and William Warburton; Ralph Allen Warburton, the bishop&#x27;s only son, and author Henry Skrine of Warleigh, were other pupils. Shenstone&#x27;s letter to Graves on the death of Anthony Whistler was among the manuscripts of Alfred Morrison.

==Works==
Graves was a collector of poems, a translator, essayist and correspondent.

===&quot;The Spiritual Quixote&quot;===

Graves&#x27;s major work is the picaresque novel, &quot;The Spiritual Quixote&quot; (1773). It is a satire on John Wesley, George Whitefield, and Methodism in general, which he saw as a threat to his Anglican congregation.

The book&#x27;s full title was &quot;The Spiritual Quixote, or the Summer&#x27;s Ramble of Mr. Geoffry Wildgoose, a Comic Romance&quot; (anon.), 1773, 1774 (two editions), 1783, and 1792. It was in Anna Barbauld&#x27;s collection &quot;British Novelists&quot;, and in Walker&#x27;s &quot;British Classics&quot;. It ridiculed the intrusion of the laity into spiritual functions and the enthusiasm of the Methodists.

The hero has been identified with Sir Harry Trelawny, 5th Baronet (unlikely by chronology), Joseph Townsend and his own brother Charles Caspar Graves. The novel is said to have arisen out of the arrival in the parish of Claverton of a shoemaker from Bradford-on-Avon, who held a meeting in the village. The rambles in the novel brought Wildgoose to Bath, Bristol, the Leasowes of Shenstone, and the Peak District. A key to several of the personages was supplied by Alleyne Fitzherbert to John Wilson Croker. Graves&#x27;s own love life was portrayed in vol. ii.

===Other works===
Graves from early life wrote verses for magazines, and some of his poems appeared in the collections of Robert Dodsley (iv. 330–7) and George Pearch (iii. 133–8). He also wrote several plays, while his prose works were popular in his day. He published:

Graves wrote the 30th number, on &quot;grumbling&quot;, in Thomas Monro&#x27;s &quot;Olla Podrida&quot; In the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, 1815, pt. ii. p. 3, are some &quot;Lines written by him under an hour-glass in the grotto at Claverton&quot;.

==Family==
Graves married Lucy Bartholomew (died 1777), a farmer&#x27;s daughter from Aldworth, after eloping to London with her around the end of 1746. In August 1747 they had a son, Richard. She had been baptised in 1730, and was uneducated; he had sent her to a private school in London before the marriage. His friends did not immediately accept his marriage, but came round to it.

The couple had four sons, including Richard, Morgan and Danvers, and a daughter. Their grandson Richard Charles Head Graves was vicar of Great Malvern.

In one of Marcos&#x27; business trips, he arrives at Quinchicoto, a small town near Ambato, where he meets María José Fiallos and with whom he marries in the church &quot;La Matriz&quot; in Ambato, January 1, 1811. 

Born in Ambato to José Marcos Montalvo and Josefa Fiallos, he studied philosophy and law in Quito before returning to his hometown in 1854. He held diplomatic posts in Italy and France from 1857 to 1859. A political liberal, Montalvo&#x27;s beliefs were marked by anti-clericalism and a keen hatred for the two caudillos that ruled Ecuador during his life: Gabriel García Moreno and Ignacio de Veintemilla. After an issue of &quot;El Cosmopolita&quot; viciously attacked Moreno, Montalvo was exiled to Colombia for seven years. Moreno&#x27;s assassination was attributed to Montalvo&#x27;s writings. He was a dedicated champion of democracy and an enemy of the writer Juan León Mera.

In the late seventies Juan Montalvo was twice exiled to France, remaining there from 1879, as punishment for &quot;Las catilinarias&quot; (1880), the work that made him famous throughout intellectual circles in the United States, Europe and the rest of Latin America. Alongside full-length books, Montalvo was an accomplished essayist, and his &quot;Siete Tratados&quot; (1882) and &quot;Geometría Moral&quot; (published in 1902, after his death) were popular in Ecuador and were banned by Veintemilla.

He also wrote a sequel to Miguel de Cervantes&#x27;s &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, called &quot;Capítulos que se le Olvidaron a Cervantes&quot; (&quot;Chapters Cervantes Forgot&quot;), published posthumously in 1895. He died of tuberculosis in Paris. His mummified body now rests in a mausoleum in his birthplace of Ambato.

==Family==
Juan Montalvo&#x27;s father was Marco Montalvo Oviedo of Guano, and his mother was María Josefa Fiallos y Villacreces of Ambato. Montalvo was the youngest of 7 siblings: Francisco, Francisco Javier, Mariano, Alegría, Rosa, Juana and Isabel. Montalvo married María Guzmán Suárez in Ambato on 17 October 1868 and had two children with her. In 1882 he met Augustine Contoux with whom he had one child.

==Legacy==
Montalvo&#x27;s likeness appears on the Ecuadorian five-centavo coin.

<doc id="679294" wikidata="Q1154504" url="?curid=679294" title="Diffuse reflection">
<text>Diffuse reflection is the reflection of light or other waves or particles from a surface such that a ray incident on the surface is scattered at many angles rather than at just one angle as in the case of specular reflection. An &quot;ideal&quot; diffuse reflecting surface is said to exhibit Lambertian reflection, meaning that there is equal luminance when viewed from all directions lying in the half-space adjacent to the surface.

A surface built from a non-absorbing powder such as plaster, or from fibers such as paper, or from a polycrystalline material such as white marble, reflects light diffusely with great efficiency. Many common materials exhibit a mixture of specular and diffuse reflection.

The visibility of objects, excluding light-emitting ones, is primarily caused by diffuse reflection of light: it is diffusely-scattered light that forms the image of the object in an observer&#x27;s eye over a wide range of angles of the observer with respect to the object. 

==Mechanism==

Diffuse reflection from solids is generally not due to surface roughness. A flat surface is indeed required to give specular reflection, but it does not prevent diffuse reflection. A piece of highly polished white marble remains white; no amount of polishing will turn it into a mirror. Polishing produces some specular reflection, but the remaining light continues to be diffusely reflected.

The most general mechanism by which a surface gives diffuse reflection does not involve &quot;exactly&quot; the surface: most of the light is contributed by scattering centers beneath the surface, as illustrated in Figure 1.
If one were to imagine that the figure represents snow, and that the polygons are its (transparent) ice crystallites, an impinging ray is partially reflected (a few percent) by the first particle, enters in it, is again reflected by the interface with the second particle, enters in it, impinges on the third, and so on, generating a series of &quot;primary&quot; scattered rays in random directions, which, in turn, through the same mechanism, generate a large number of &quot;secondary&quot; scattered rays, which generate &quot;tertiary&quot; rays, and so forth. All these rays walk through the snow crystallites, which do not absorb light, until they arrive at the surface and exit in random directions. The result is that the light that was sent out is returned in all directions, so that snow is white despite being made of transparent material (ice crystals).

For simplicity, &quot;reflections&quot; are spoken of here, but more generally the interface between the small particles that constitute many materials is irregular on a scale comparable with light wavelength, so diffuse light is generated at each interface, rather than a single reflected ray, but the story can be told the same way.

This mechanism is very general, because almost all common materials are made of &quot;small things&quot; held together. Mineral materials are generally polycrystalline: one can describe them as made of a 3D mosaic of small, irregularly shaped defective crystals. Organic materials are usually composed of fibers or cells, with their membranes and their complex internal structure. And each interface, inhomogeneity or imperfection can deviate, reflect or scatter light, reproducing the above mechanism.

Few materials do not cause diffuse reflection: among these are metals, which do not allow light to enter; gases, liquids, glass, and transparent plastics (which have a liquid-like amorphous microscopic structure); single crystals, such as some gems or a salt crystal; and some very special materials, such as the tissues which make the cornea and the lens of an eye. These materials can reflect diffusely, however, if their surface is microscopically rough, like in a frost glass (Figure 2), or, of course, if their homogeneous structure deteriorates, as in cataracts of the eye lens.

A surface may also exhibit both specular and diffuse reflection, as is the case, for example, of glossy paints as used in home painting, which give also a fraction of specular reflection, while matte paints give almost exclusively diffuse reflection.

Most materials can give some specular reflection, provided that their surface can be polished to eliminate irregularities comparable with the light wavelength (a fraction of a micrometer). Depending on the material and surface roughness, reflection may be mostly specular, mostly diffuse, or anywhere in between. A few materials, like liquids and glasses, lack the internal subdivisions which produce the subsurface scattering mechanism described above, and so give &quot;only&quot; specular reflection. Among common materials, only polished metals can reflect light specularly with high efficiency, as in aluminum or silver usually used in mirrors. All other common materials, even when perfectly polished, usually give not more than a few percent specular reflection, except in particular cases, such as grazing angle reflection by a lake, or the &quot;total reflection&quot; of a glass prism, or when structured in certain complex configurations such as the silvery skin of many fish species or the reflective surface of a dielectric mirror. Diffuse reflection can be highly efficient, as in white materials, due to the summing up of the many subsurface reflections.

==Colored objects==
Up to this point white objects have been discussed, which do not absorb light. But the above scheme continues to be valid in the case that the material is absorbent. In this case, diffused rays will lose some wavelengths during their walk in the material, and will emerge colored.

Diffusion affects the color of objects in a substantial manner because it determines the average path of light in the material, and hence to which extent the various wavelengths are absorbed. Red ink looks black when it stays in its bottle. Its vivid color is only perceived when it is placed on a scattering material (e.g. paper). This is so because light&#x27;s path through the paper fibers (and through the ink) is only a fraction of millimeter long. However, light from the bottle has crossed several centimeters of ink and has been heavily absorbed, even in its red wavelengths.

And, when a colored object has both diffuse and specular reflection, usually only the diffuse component is colored. A cherry reflects diffusely red light, absorbs all other colors and has a specular reflection which is essentially white (if the incident light is white light). This is quite general, because, except for metals, the reflectivity of most materials depends on their refractive index, which varies little with the wavelength (though it is this variation that causes the chromatic dispersion in a prism), so that all colors are reflected nearly with the same intensity.

==Importance for vision==
The vast majority of visible objects are seen primarily by diffuse reflection from their surface.
Exceptions include objects with polished (specularly reflecting) surfaces, and objects that themselves emit light. Rayleigh scattering is responsible for the blue color of the sky, and Mie scattering for the white color of the water droplets in clouds.

==Interreflection==
&quot;Diffuse interreflection&quot; is a process whereby light reflected from an object strikes other objects in the surrounding area, illuminating them. Diffuse interreflection specifically describes light reflected from objects which are not shiny or specular. In real life terms what this means is that light is reflected off non-shiny surfaces such as the ground, walls, or fabric, to reach areas not directly in view of a light source. If the diffuse surface is colored, the reflected light is also colored, resulting in similar coloration of surrounding objects.

In 3D computer graphics, diffuse interreflection is an important component of global illumination. There are a number of ways to model diffuse interreflection when rendering a scene. Radiosity and photon mapping are two commonly used methods.

==Spectroscopy==
Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy can be used to determine the absorption spectra of powdered samples in cases where transmission spectroscopy is not feasible. This applies to UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy or mid-infrared spectroscopy.

<doc id="679297" wikidata="Q1079524" url="?curid=679297" title="Specular reflection">
<text>Specular reflection, or regular reflection, is the mirror-like reflection of waves, such as light, from a surface. 

The law of reflection states that a reflected ray of light emerges from the reflecting surface at the same angle to the surface normal as the incident ray, but on the opposing side of the surface normal in the plane formed by the incident and reflected rays. This behavior was first described by Hero of Alexandria (AD c. 10–70). Later, Alhazen gave a complete statement of the law of reflection. He was first to state that the incident ray, the reflected ray, and the normal to the surface all lie in a same plane perpendicular to reflecting plane.

Specular reflection may be contrasted with diffuse reflection, in which light is scattered away from the surface in a range of directions.

== Law of reflection ==
When light encounters a boundary of a material, it is affected by the optical and electronic response functions of the material to electromagnetic waves. Optical processes, which comprise reflection and refraction, are expressed by the difference of the refractive index on both sides of the boundary, whereas reflectance and absorption are the real and imaginary parts of the response due to the electronic structure of the material.
The degree of participation of each of these processes in the transmission is a function of the frequency, or wavelength, of the light, its polarization, and its angle of incidence. In general, reflection increases with increasing angle of incidence, and with increasing absorptivity at the boundary. The Fresnel equations describe the physics at the optical boundary.

Reflection may occur as specular, or mirror-like, reflection and diffuse reflection. Specular reflection reflects all light which arrives from a given direction at the same angle, whereas diffuse reflection reflects light in a broad range of directions. The distinction may be illustrated with surfaces coated with glossy paint and matte paint. Matte paints exhibit essentially complete diffuse reflection, while glossy paints show a larger component of specular behavior. A surface built from a non-absorbing powder, such as plaster, can be a nearly perfect diffuser, whereas polished metallic objects can specularly reflect light very efficiently. The reflecting material of mirrors is usually aluminum or silver.

Light propagates in space as a wave front of electromagnetic fields. A ray of light is characterized by the direction normal to the wave front (&quot;wave normal&quot;). When a ray encounters a surface, the angle that the wave normal makes with respect to the surface normal is called the angle of incidence and the plane defined by both directions is the plane of incidence. Reflection of the incident ray also occurs in the plane of incidence.

The law of reflection states that the angle of reflection of a ray equals the angle of incidence, and that the incident direction, the surface normal, and the reflected direction are coplanar.

When the light is incident perpendicularly to the surface, it is reflected straight back in the source direction.

The phenomenon of reflection arises from the diffraction of a plane wave on a flat boundary. When the boundary size is much larger than the wavelength, then the electromagnetic fields at the boundary are oscillating exactly in phase only for the specular direction.

=== Vector formulation ===
The law of reflection can also be equivalently expressed using linear algebra. The direction of a reflected ray is determined by the vector of incidence and the surface normal vector. Given an incident direction formula_1 from the light source to the surface and the surface normal direction formula_2 the specularly reflected direction formula_3 (all unit vectors) is:
: formula_4
where formula_5 is a scalar obtained with the dot product. Different authors may define the incident and reflection directions with different signs.
Assuming these Euclidean vectors are represented in column form, the equation can be equivalently expressed as a matrix-vector multiplication:
: formula_6
where formula_7 is the so-called Householder transformation matrix, defined as:
: formula_8
in terms of the identity matrix formula_9 and twice the outer product of formula_10.

== Reflectivity ==
&quot;Reflectivity&quot; is the ratio of the power of the reflected wave to that of the incident wave. It is a function of the wavelength of radiation, and is related to the refractive index of the material as expressed by Fresnel&#x27;s equations. In regions of the electromagnetic spectrum in which absorption by the material is significant, it is related to the electronic absorption spectrum through the imaginary component of the complex refractive index. The electronic absorption spectrum of an opaque material, which is difficult or impossible to measure directly, may therefore be indirectly determined from the reflection spectrum by a Kramers-Kronig transform. The polarization of the reflected light depends on the symmetry of the arrangement of the incident probing light with respect to the absorbing transitions dipole moments in the material.

Measurement of specular reflection is performed with normal or varying incidence reflection spectrophotometers (&quot;reflectometer&quot;) using a scanning variable-wavelength light source. Lower quality measurements using a glossmeter quantify the glossy appearance of a surface in gloss units.

== Consequences ==
=== Internal reflection ===
When light is propagating in a material and strikes an interface with a material of lower index of refraction, some of the light is reflected. If the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle, total internal reflection occurs: all of the light is reflected. The critical angle can be shown to be given by
: formula_11

=== Polarization ===
When light strikes an interface between two materials, the reflected light is generally partially polarized. However, if the light strikes the interface at Brewster&#x27;s angle, the reflected light is &quot;completely&quot; linearly polarized parallel to the interface. Brewster&#x27;s angle is given by
: formula_12

=== Reflected images ===

The image in a flat mirror has these features:
* It is the same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front.
* It is the same size as the object.
* It is the right way up (erect).
* It is reversed.
* It is &quot;virtual&quot;, meaning that the image appears to be behind the mirror, and cannot be projected onto a screen.

The reversal of images by a plane mirror is perceived differently depending on the circumstances. In many cases, the image in a mirror appears to be reversed from left to right. If a flat mirror is mounted on the ceiling it can appear to reverse &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; if a person stands under it and looks up at it. Similarly a car turning &quot;left&quot; will still appear to be turning &quot;left&quot; in the rear view mirror for the driver of a car in front of it. The reversal of directions, or lack thereof, depends on how the directions are defined. More specifically a mirror changes the handedness of the coordinate system, one axis of the coordinate system appears to be reversed, and the chirality of the image may change. For example, the image of a right shoe will look like a left shoe.

== Examples ==

A classic example of specular reflection is a mirror, which is specifically designed for specular reflection.

In addition to visible light, specular reflection can be observed in the ionospheric reflection of radiowaves and the reflection of radio- or microwave radar signals by flying objects. The measurement technique of x-ray reflectivity exploits specular reflectivity to study thin films and interfaces with sub-nanometer resolution, using either modern laboratory sources or synchrotron x-rays.

Non-electromagnetic waves can also exhibit specular reflection, as in acoustic mirrors which reflect sound, and atomic mirrors, which reflect neutral atoms. For the efficient reflection of atoms from a solid-state mirror, very cold atoms and/or grazing incidence are used in order to provide significant quantum reflection; ridged mirrors are used to enhance the specular reflection of atoms. Neutron reflectometry uses specular reflection to study material surfaces and thin film interfaces in an analogous fashion to x-ray reflectivity.

<text>The Cat&#x27;s paw is a knot used for connecting a rope to an object. It is very similar to the cow hitch except there is an additional twist on each side of the bight, making it less prone to slipping.

== Uses ==
* Attaching a sling (a rope that has been formed into a continuous loop) to a hook

== Comments==
The knot balances the load between the two halves of the hitch, and is used in wharfs and docks. If one half fails, the other should hold until the load can be safely and swiftly lowered to the ground.

When the sling is long the knot can be pre-formed in anywhere in it, then slid over the end of a hook or post.

== Structure ==
Formed from a bight turned up over itself (like a girth hitch) but with extra twists on each side to achieve the desired friction.

== Tying ==
=== Method 1 ===
Form a bight in the middle of the line, and pull it back over itself like a girth hitch. This forms two loops, turned in opposite directions. Convert each loop into an elbow by adding a twist in the direction that will tend to tighten them (the wrong direction will undo the loop completely). Pass both elbow over the hook, rail or post and pull tight, taking care to push the bight up snugly against the turns.

=== Method 2 ===
If working end of the line has an eye in it, and the standing end is accessible, the knot can be tied to a closed ring, another eye, or a rail with inaccessible ends, as follows. Pass the eye around the ring or rail, then pass the standing end through its own eye (this effectively forms a girth hitch). Then pass the standing end through the eye again, and pull up tight, taking care to push the bight up snugly against the turns.

When using the cat&#x27;s paw to join two eyes, this process may be repeated several times to give several turns - as many as five in a fine fishing monofilament. Then when tightened, instead of pulling the bight up against the turns, both eyes are pulled equally, to make neat coils of turns in both eyes, meeting halfway between them.

<doc id="679306" wikidata="Q7875112" url="?curid=679306" title="Estádio da Luz">
<text>The Estádio da Luz (), officially named Estádio do Sport Lisboa e Benfica, is a multi-purpose stadium located in Lisbon, Portugal. It is used mostly for association football matches, hosting the home games of Portuguese club Benfica, its owner.

Opened on 25 October 2003 with an exhibition match between Benfica and Uruguayan club Nacional, it replaced the original Estádio da Luz, which had 120,000 seats. The seating capacity of the new stadium is currently set at 64,642. The stadium was designed by HOK Sport Venue Event (now Populous) and had a construction cost of €162 million.

A UEFA category four stadium and one of the biggest stadiums by capacity in Europe (the biggest in Portugal), Estádio da Luz hosted several matches of the UEFA Euro 2004, including its final, as well as the 2014 and 2020 finals of the UEFA Champions League. It was elected the most beautiful stadium of Europe in a 2014 online poll by &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;. By its fifteenth birthday, Estádio do Sport Lisboa e Benfica Luz had welcomed more than 17 million spectators. The stadium is one of the potential venues for the 2030 FIFA World Cup, which Portugal will co-host along with Morocco and Spain.

==Naming==
While the previous Benfica stadium was also officially named &quot;Estádio do Sport Lisboa e Benfica&quot;, both the old and the new stadia are invariably referred to by their unofficial name, Estádio da Luz. &quot;Luz&quot; is the name of the neighborhood the stadium was built on, on the border between the parishes of Benfica and Carnide, which itself derives its name from the nearby Igreja de Nossa Senhora da Luz (Church of Our Lady of Light). This unofficial name caught on soon after the original stadium&#x27;s construction; the people of Lisbon used to simply call it &quot;a Luz&quot; (&quot;the Light&quot;). Therefore, the stadium&#x27;s common name became &quot;Estádio da Luz&quot;, which is usually anglicised to &quot;Stadium of Light&quot;. This translation, however, could be argued to be inaccurate, since &quot;Luz&quot; refers not to &quot;light&quot; but to the original address of the stadium: &quot;Estrada da Luz&quot; (&quot;Road of Light&quot;).

==Characteristics==
Architect Damon Lavelle, from HOK Sport Venue Event (now Populous), designed the stadium to focus on light and transparency. Its polycarbonate roof allows the sunlight to penetrate the stadium in order to illuminate it. The roof, which is supported by tie-beams of four steel arches, seems to float on the underlying tribunes. The arches are 43 metres (141 feet) high and help define the look of the stadium, after having been shaped to be similar to the wavy profile of its three tiers. According to Lavelle, the seating capacity may be increased up to 80,000. However, the most realistic option is to expand by selling standing places, which would require a change in the law.

In June 2024, Sport Lisboa e Benfica announced that it would increase the stadium&#x27;s capacity to nearly 66,000 spectators by adding 950 seats in a row of seats around the stadium reserved for people with motor disabilities.

<text>Draycote Water is a reservoir and country park near the village of Dunchurch, south of Rugby in Warwickshire, England, owned and operated by Severn Trent Water. It draws its water from the River Leam, and supplies drinking water to Rugby and Coventry. It is named after the nearby hamlet of Draycote and is the largest body of water within Warwickshire.

The reservoir was created in the 1960s and was opened in 1970, with a new pipe and pump installed in 2012. It has a capacity of up to 5 billion gallons (23 million m³) and a maximum depth of .

It is a site for birdwatching and has a bird hide, with a feeding station sponsored by the West Midland Bird Club. Severn-Trent manage an adjacent country park. Draycote is used by cyclists, runners, windsurfers, fly fishers and for boating. Fishing is for brown trout and rainbow trout from the banks or from boats. A farm to the north east of the site has a herd of alpacas.

==Description==

Draycote Water is an artificial reservoir, which supplies water to southern and eastern Warwickshire, in particular Rugby (via Barby Storage Reservoir) and Coventry. Owned and managed by Severn Trent Water, it is located just to the south of the M45 motorway in the hamlet of Draycote, which is close to Dunchurch. It is accessed from the A426 road, at . The reservoir has no natural inlets, its water being obtained by pumping from the nearby River Leam and from nearby Stanford Reservoir which obtains its water from the River Avon. It has an area of approximately , with a maximum depth of and a capacity of 5 billion gallons (23 million m³). The shoreline of the reservoir is a mixture of concrete and natural embankment.

Draycote Water was built between 1967 and 1969, to cope with rising demand in eastern and southern Warwickshire, and opened in 1970. In early 2012 the reservoir had to be closed temporarily, as record-low rainfall during the winter months had caused its level to reduce to less than 50% of capacity. Severn Trent responded by reversing the flow of water in an existing pipeline between Draycote Water and Welches Meadow Reservoir adjacent to the River Leam in Leamington Spa. This development required a short length of new pipe at the Draycote end and a new pump at Leamington.

==Flora and fauna==
The reservoir features many bird species. This includes the great northern diver, which makes a prolonged visit during the winter months, along with kittiwake and small numbers of Mediterranean and little gulls. There are several species of diving duck with the tufted duck the most common, numbering around 1,200 individuals. The most common bird at the site is the black-headed gull, which forms the majority of a gull roost of more than 50,000 individuals. A number of waders visit Draycote in the autumn, including the ringed and little ringed plover.

The reservoir&#x27;s fish include the brown trout and rainbow trout, some with a mass in excess of . These are fished for sport, both from boats and from the banks.

To the north east of the reservoir is Toft Farm, which features a herd of alpacas.

==Sport and leisure==

Draycote Water has a country park on its southern shore, which extends across . The park has facilities for bird watching and fishing, as well as several nature trails and a visitor centre. A track around the perimeter allows cyclists and walkers to circumnavigate the reservoir, a total distance of . The Draycote Water Sailing Club is situated on the shoreline and offers dinghy sailing and windsurfing as well as races.

The reservoir&#x27;s owner, Severn Trent Water, warns the public not to swim in the reservoir, citing the large depth, potentially cold temperatures, and the risk of currents caused by the pumps which supply the water.

<text>Mercier (; also known as Montreal—Mercier) was a federal electoral district in Quebec, Canada, that was represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1935 to 2004. In 2003, the district was abolished and split into the La Pointe-de-l&#x27;Île and Honoré-Mercier ridings. A provincial electoral district still exists under the same name but is located in Plateau Mont-Royal borough.

==History==

Mercier riding was created in 1933 from Laval—Two Mountains and Maisonneuve ridings.

It initially consisted of:
* parts of the city of Montreal;
* the towns of Montreal North, St-Michel-de-Laval, St-Léonard-de-Port-Maurice, Montreal East, Pointe-aux-Trembles;
* the parishes of Rivière-des-Prairies, St-Léonard-de-Port-Maurice, and St-Jean-de-Dieu Asylum; and * the municipality of Pont-Viau and the town of Laval-des-Rapides in Laval county..

In 1966, it was defined as consisting of:
* the City of Pointe-aux-Trembles;
* the Towns of Anjou and Montreal East;
* the part of the City of Montreal bounded by Saint-Donat Street, the Towns of Anjou and Montreal East, and Saint-Lawrence River;
* the part of the City of Montreal bounded by the Cities of Pointeaux-Trembles and Montreal North, the Towns of Anjou and Montreal East, and Des Prairies River.

In 1976, it was defined as consisting of:
* the City of Pointe-aux-Trembles;
* the Town of Montreal East;
* the part of the City of Montreal bounded by the Cities of Pointeaux-Trembles and Montreal North, by the Towns of Anjou and Montreal East and by des Prairies River;
* the part of the City of Montreal bounded by a line commencing from the Saint Lawrence River along Saint-Donat Street, the Canadian National Railway; the northeastern limit of the parish municipality of Saint-Jean-de-Dieu, Sherbrooke Street East, Highway 25, the limits of the towns of Anjou and Montreal East to the Saint Lawrence River.

In 1980, it was renamed &quot;Montreal—Mercier&quot;. In 1987, Montreal—Mercier was split into Anjou—Rivière-Des-Prairies and a re-created Mercier riding. The new Mercier riding also incorporated territory from Gamelin riding.

The new Mercier riding consisted of:
* the Town of Montréal-Est;
* parts of the City of Montréal.

The district was abolished in 2003 when it was split into La Pointe-de-l&#x27;Île and Honoré-Mercier ridings.

<doc id="679331" wikidata="Q2668789" url="?curid=679331" title="Culture of Ecuador">
<text>Ecuador is a multicultural and multiethnic nation, with the majority of its population is descended from a mixture of both European and Amerindian ancestry. The other 10% of Ecuador&#x27;s population originate east of the Atlantic Ocean, predominantly from Spain, Italy, Lebanon, France and Germany. Around the Esmeraldas and Chota regions, the African influence would be strong among the small population of Afro-Ecuadorians that account for no more than 10%. Close to 80% of Ecuadorians are Roman Catholic, although the indigenous population blend Christian beliefs with ancient indigenous customs. The racial makeup of Ecuador is 70% mestizo (mixed Amerindian and white), 7% Amerindian, 12% White, and 11% Black.

Ecuador can be split up into four geographically distinct areas; the &quot;Costa&quot; (coast), the &quot;Sierra&quot; (highlands), &quot;El Oriente&quot; (the east; which includes the Amazonic region) and the Galápagos Islands.

There is tension and general dislike between the residents of the highlands Quito and the coast Guayaquil the two largest cities of the country. Centralism in these two cities, also creates animus from neighboring provinces. The at times extreme cultural differences between the Coast and the Mountainous Regions can be traced back to pre-hispanic times as the Sierra had a strong Incan presence whereas the Coast was sparsely populated by non-Incan populations such as the Valdivia, Moche, etc. Post colonization the regionalism was accentuated and perpetuated, with the Coast having more Pan-European and African influences and the Sierra having strictly Indigenous influences. The animosity between the two regions has effectively bifurcated the country into two distinct ethnic consciousness and national identities. The enmity between the regions has often detained national economic progress as development in one region or the other is viewed with chagrin.

==History==

Ecuador was inhabited with numerous civilizations which constructed the ethnic cultural background of Ecuador years before the Inca Empire. Many civilizations rose throughout Ecuador, such as the Chorre and the Valdivia, the latter of which spans its existence before any civilization in the Americas. The most notable groups that existed in Ecuador before, and during the Inca conquest were the Quitus (near present-day Quito), the Cañari (in present-day Cuenca), and the Las Vegas Culture (near Guayaquil). Each civilization developed its own distinguished architecture, pottery, and religious beliefs, while others developed archaeologically disputed systems of writing (an achievement the Incas did not achieve). After years of fierce resistance, the Cañari succumbed to the Inca expansion, and were assimilated loosely under the Inca Empire. The Inca were an advanced society which originated in Peru, and established a great empire within one century. It dominated Peru and extended as far as Colombia and central Chile, as well as Ecuador. To communicate with each other they developed stone-paved highways spanning thousands of miles used by messengers. These messengers passed each other records of the empire&#x27;s status, which are sometimes thought to have been encoded in a system of knots called &quot;quipu&quot;. Remarkably, the Cañari, Quitus, and Caras were able to hold back &quot;Tupac-Yupanqui&quot; for years, though they proved less successful against his son, Huayna Capac. After conquering Ecuador, Huayna Capac imposed upon the tribes the use of the Quechua (or &quot;Kichwa&quot;) language, &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the Inca and still widely spoken in Ecuador. The Cañaris were the strongest, and fiercest group in Ecuador to fall, and after their collapse and subsequent assimilation, the conquest of lands north became easier.

In celebration of his victory, Tupac Yupanqui ordered a great city to be built, Tomebamba, where is the present Cuenca, there he built a palace called Pumapungo over the ancient Cañari town. When he died in 1526, Huayna Capac divided the empire between his two sons, Atahualpa and Huáscar. Atahualpa ruled in the north from Quito, while Huáscar ruled in the south from Cuzco. Huáscar and Atuahualpa wanted all the empire, they could not share the territory, so an internal war took place. Francisco Pizarro landed in Ecuador in 1532, accompanied by 180 fully armed men, his mission was to find gold. Several years earlier, Pizarro had made a peaceful visit to the coast, where he heard rumors in Colombia of El Dorado of inland cities which had incredible amounts of gold. This time, he intended to conquer the Incas just as Hernando Cortez did in Mexico—and he couldn&#x27;t have picked a better time. Atahualpa had only recently won the war against his brother Huáscar when Pizarro arrived. Pizarro ambushed the ruler, forced him to collect an enormous ransom, and then executed him. Spanish governors ruled Ecuador for nearly 300 years, first from the viceroyalty of Lima, then later from the viceroyalty of Gran Colombia. The Spanish introduced Roman Catholicism, colonial architecture, and the Spanish language. Independence was won in 1822, when the famed South American liberator Simón Bolívar joined Sucre and defeated a Spanish army at the Battle of Pichincha.

==Regionalism==
Each region is divided according to its own unique geography, creating a sense of individual regional pride. The most notable regional competition or fierce enmity is between &quot;Guayaquileños,&quot; Coastal Ecuadorians and &quot;Quiteños&quot;, Highland Ecuadorians. This sense of regionalism has created incredibly barriers between countrymen. Due to strong regionalism, the national economy has suffered, as either region and its peoples hesitate to do anything that might result in the expansion of the other&#x27;s economy, even if it would mean slowing the national economy. During wartime, regionalism was considerably abated, but there are reports of individuals betraying their country, due to their desire to see the other region lose; for example, allegations that someone had given information to enemy troops during &quot;Tawantinzuma&quot;.

==Family==
Ecuadorians place great importance on family, both nuclear and extended. Unlike in much of the modern west, Ecuadorians live in multi-generational homes with the elderly and young children living under the same household. Godparents or &quot;padrinos&quot; have an important role in Ecuador, where they are often expected to provide both financial and psychological support to their godchildren.

Families are formed in at least one of the following two ways: Civil Marriage (which is the legal form of formalizing a bond between a man and woman, which all married couples are required to undergo) and the Free Union (where a man and woman decide to form a family, without undergoing any official ceremony). The Ecuadorian Constitution accords the members of a Free Union family, the same rights and duties as any other legally constituted family.

There are many variations in family structure, as well as in the social and cultural structure in Ecuador, depending on the socioeconomic position in which people live. Generally, the upper classes adopt more white American or white European ways of life, customs, and culture. Whereas, lower classes more widely adopt the customs, lifestyles, and culture of native peoples. This leads to great contrasts within Ecuadorian people, effectively creating parallel societies. 

===Marital roles===

Women are generally responsible for the upbringing and care of children, and of husbands in Ecuador, and traditionally, men have taken a completely inactive role in this area. This has begun to change, due to the fact that more and more women are joining the workforce, which has resulted in men doing housework and becoming involved in the care of their children. This change was greatly influenced by Eloy Alfaro&#x27;s liberal revolution in 1906, in which Ecuadorian women were granted the right to work. Women&#x27;s suffrage was granted in 1929.

Girls tend to be more protected by their parents than boys, due to traditional social structures. At age 15, girls often have traditional parties called &quot;fiesta de quince años&quot;. &quot;Quinceañera&quot; is the term used for the girl, not the party. The party involves festive food and dance. This coming of age or &quot;debutante&quot; party is a tradition found in most Latin American countries, comparable to the American tradition of sweet sixteen parties.

This special event sometimes involves a doll being given away to show adulthood.

==Television and cinema==
The majority of the movies shown in movie theatres in Ecuador come from the United States and Spain. The movies are often in English, and have Spanish subtitles, but are sometimes translated for family movies.

The Ecuador Film Company was founded in Guayaquil in 1924. During the early 1920s to early 1930s, Ecuador enjoyed its Cinema Golden Age era. However, the production of motion pictures declined with the coming of sound.

&quot;Beyond the Gates of Splendor&quot; (2002), directed by Jim Hanon, is a documentary about five missionaries killed by the Huaorani Indians in the 1950s. He recycles the story in the 2006 Hollywood production End of the Spear. Most of this film was shot in Panama.

&quot;Entre Marx y una Mujer Desnuda&quot; (&quot;Between Marx and a Nude Woman&quot;, 1995), by Ecuadorian Camilo Luzuriaga, provides a window into the life of young Ecuadorian leftists living in a country, plagued by the remnants of feudal systems and coups d&#x27;état. It is based on a novel by Jorge Enrique Adoum.

==Cuisine==
An Ecuadorian&#x27;s day, at least as far as his or her diet is concerned, is centered around lunch, rather than dinner.

There is no one food that is especially Ecuadorian, as cuisine varies from region, people, and cultures. For example, &quot;Costeños&quot; (people from the coast) prefer fish, beef, beans, rice, and plantains (unripened banana like fruits), while &quot;Serranos&quot; from the mountainous regions prefer pork, chicken, corn, potatoes, and white hominy mote.

Some general examples of Ecuadorian cuisine include &quot;patacones&quot; (unripe plantains fried in oil, mashed up, then refried), &quot;llapingachos&quot; (a pan seared potato ball), &quot;seco de chivo&quot; (a type of stew made from goat), and &quot;fanesca&quot; (a type of soup made from beans, lentils, and corn), traditionally served on Easter. More regionalized examples include &quot;ceviche&quot; from the coast, churrasco, and&quot;encebollado&quot;, the most popular dish on the coast.

==Language==

Most Ecuadorians speak Spanish, though many speak Amerindian languages such as Kichwa, the Ecuadorian dialect of Quechua. Other Amerindian languages spoken in Ecuador include Awapit (spoken by the Awá), A&#x27;ingae (spoken by the Cofan), Shuar Chicham (spoken by the Shuar), Achuar-Shiwiar (spoken by the Achuar and the Shiwiar), Cha&#x27;palaachi (spoken by the Chachi), Tsa&#x27;fiki (spoken by the Tsáchila), Paicoca (spoken by the Siona and Secoya),((chino)), and Wao Tededeo (spoken by the Waorani).

Though most features of Ecuadorian Spanish are those universal to the Spanish-speaking world, there are several idiosyncrasies.

&quot;Costeños&quot; tend to speak more quickly and louder than &quot;serranos&#x27;&quot;, with strong linguistic similarities to Canarian Spanish. A common term &quot;costeños&quot; call one another is &quot;mijo&quot;, a contraction of the phrase &quot;mi hijo&quot; (&quot;my son&quot;). Several such terms are derived in consequence of their rapid speech, and they also employ intricate linguistic humor and jokes that are difficult to translate or even understand in the other regions. Furthermore, each province has a different variety of accent, with different specific terms influenced by the different racial and ethnic groups that immigrated and settled the areas.

&quot;Serranos&quot; usually speak softly and with less speed. They are traditionally seen as more conservative, and use a number of Kichwa-derived terms in their everyday speech which is often puzzling to other regions. A widely known example is the word &quot;wawa&quot; which means &quot;child&quot; in Kichwa. Their speech is influenced by their Incan Amerindian roots, and can be seen as a variant of other Andean accents. However two main accents are noticed in the Andean region, the north and the austral accent. More variations of the austral accent are found in southern regions.

Whistling, yelling, or yawning to get someone&#x27;s attention is considered rude, yet is practiced informally and mostly by lower classes. 

==Art==

===Indigenous art of Tigua===
The Kichwa people of Tigua, located in the central Sierra region, are world-renowned for their traditional paintings on sheepskin canvases. Historically, the Tigua people have been known for painting highly decorative masks and drums; painting on flat surfaces is somewhat of a modern occurrence. Today, Tigua paintings can be found for sale all over Ecuador, particularly in touristic areas.

Tigua artists are celebrated for their use of vibrant colors and simplistic themes. Most paintings depict scenes of pastoral life, religious ceremonies, and festivals. The volcano Cotopaxi is commonly depicted in the landscape of many paintings, as it holds particular cultural significance in the region.

==Literature==

San Juan de Ambato, a city in central Ecuador, is known as the &quot;City of the three Juanes&quot;, with Juan Montalvo (a novelist and essayist), Juan León Mera (author of the words to Ecuador&#x27;s national anthem, and &quot;Salve, Oh Patria&quot;), and Juan Benigno Vela (another novelist and essayist) all sharing it as a place of birth. Other important writers include Eugenio Espejo, from colonial Quito, whose works inspired the fight for freedom from Spain in Ecuador and touched a number of topics, novelist and poet Horacio Hidrovo Velásquez, from early century&#x27;s Manabí, whose works have inspired films.

==Music==
The music of Ecuador has a long history. Pasillo is a genre domestic to Ecuador and is regarded as the &quot;national genre.&quot; Through the years, many cultures have brought their influences together to create new types of music. There are also different kinds of traditional music like albazo, pasacalle, fox incaico, tonada, diablada pillareña, capishca, Bomba (highly established in afro-Ecuadorian society in cities such as Esmeraldas), and so on.
Tecnocumbia and Rockola are clear examples of the influence of foreign cultures. One of the most indigenous and traditional forms of dancing in Ecuador is Sanjuanito. It&#x27;s originally from northern Ecuador (Otavalo-Imbabura). Sanjuanito is a danceable music used in the festivities of the mestizo and indigenous cultures. According to the Ecuadorian musicologist Segundo Luis Moreno, Sanjuanito was danced by indigenous people during San Juan Bautista&#x27;s birthday. This important date was established by the Spaniards on June 24, coincidentally the same date when indigenous people celebrated their rituals of Inti Raymi.
The Panama hat is of Ecuadorian origin, and is known there as &quot;Sombrero de paja toquilla&quot;, or a &quot;Jipijapa&quot;. It is made principally in Montecristi, in the province of Manabí and in the province of Azuay. Its manufacture (particularly that of the &quot;Montecristi superfino&quot;) is considered a great craft. In Cuenca an important Panama hat industry exists.



==Sports==

Football is the most popular sport in Ecuador. Some of the most noteworthy accomplishments of Ecuadorian football teams are those of Barcelona SC, having accumulated a total of 16 domestic titles, and of LDU Quito having both won the Copa Libertadores and placed second in the FIFA Club World Cup in 2008; all are feats that are currently unmatched by other teams in Ecuador.

<text>Lucozade is a British brand of soft drinks and energy drinks manufactured and marketed by the Japanese company Suntory. Created as &quot;Glucozade&quot; in the UK in 1927 by a Newcastle pharmacist, William Walker Hunter (trading as W. Owen &amp; Son), it was acquired by the British pharmaceutical company Beecham&#x27;s in 1938 and sold as Lucozade, an energy drink for the sick. Its advertising slogan was &quot;Lucozade aids recovery&quot;. It was sold mostly in pharmacies up until the 1980s before it was more readily available as a sports drink in shops across the UK.

A glucose and water solution, the product was sold until 1983 as a carbonated, slightly orange-flavoured drink in a glass bottle wrapped in cellophane. Pharmacists sold it, children were given it when ill, and hospital visitors would regularly arrive with a bottle. It was rebranded in 1978 as a &quot;pick me up&quot;, and as a sports drink in 1983, to associate it with health rather than sickness. The company switched to a plastic bottle and introduced a range of flavours. , a 500 ml bottle contained 62 g (15.5 cubes) of sugar, more than Coca-Cola. In 2017, to avoid sugar tax, the drink was reformulated to contain 22.5 g of sugar per 500 ml of liquid, as well as the artificial sweeteners aspartame and acesulfame K. In 2023, it was reformulated again. It still contains the same amount of sugar, but aspartame was swapped out for sucralose.

The UK’s No. 1 energy drink, it has been exported to Asia and Australasia. In 1989, the Beecham Group merged to form SmithKline Beecham, which further merged in 2000 to form GlaxoSmithKline. In September 2013, GlaxoSmithKline sold Lucozade and another soft drink, Ribena, to the Japanese drinks conglomerate Suntory for £1.35 billion.

==History==
&quot;Glucozade&quot; was invented by William Walker Hunter in 1927 in Newcastle; Hunter had taken over the business of pharmacist William Owen. Hunter sold the product to the Beecham Group in 1938 and it was eventually renamed Lucozade.

Lucozade originally was available in only one variety, which was effervescent with a distinctive sweet citric flavour. It was sold in a glass bottle with a yellow cellophane wrap until 1983, when it was re-branded as an energy drink to remove the brand&#x27;s associations with illness. The slogan &quot;Lucozade aids recovery&quot; was replaced by &quot;Lucozade replaces lost energy&quot;. The glass bottle was replaced by a plastic (polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) one. After the re-branding, UK sales tripled to almost £75 million between 1984 and 1989.

In 1989, the Beecham Group and SmithKline Beckman merged to form SmithKline Beecham, and in 2000 SmithKline Beecham and GlaxoWellcome merged to form GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). In 2013, GSK put Ribena and Lucozade up for sale. Suntory, a Japanese holding company, bought the brands in September for £1.35 billion. At the time of the sale, the product was manufactured in England at the Royal Forest Factory in Coleford, Gloucestershire, in the Forest of Dean.

==Commercials==
Following its rebranding as a sports drink, high-profile athletic figures in British pop culture have promoted Lucozade in television commercials, beginning with Olympic decathlon champion Daley Thompson in 1983, followed by sporting figures such as Olympic sprint champion Linford Christie, footballers John Barnes and Alan Shearer, rugby player Jonny Wilkinson, and &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; heroine Lara Croft.

==Purpose and effectiveness==

A stated purpose of sports drinks, which provide many calories of energy from sugars, is to improve performance and endurance. In an analysis by Matthew Thompson and colleagues from the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine, of 431 marketing claims of performance enhancement, most cited no evidence. 174 sources were cited for Lucozade; of them, Thompson found only three studies of high quality with a low risk of bias. The rigorous studies that did show improved endurance were &quot;of limited relevance to most people because the tests were on elite athletes&quot;. This was backed up by a research study done on professional cyclists, to see if ingesting Lucozade before an hour bike ride would impact performance. The study could not find any positive impact on performance after ingesting it. Thompson said that for the vast majority of people, drinking such products &quot;could completely counteract exercising more, playing football more, going to the gym more&quot;.

Lucozade comes in the form of liquid in either a can or plastic bottle, or it can come in the form of a tablet. The tablets have the flavours of either orange or the original flavour.

The drinks are marketed as soft drinks; a soft drinks industry spokesman said in response: &quot;By helping people participating in sport to perform better and to recover more quickly, sports drinks can encourage people to exercise more&quot;.

In May 2016, Liverpool City Council ran a &quot;name-and-shame campaign&quot; entitled &quot;Is your child’s sweet tooth harming their health?&quot;. The short-lived campaign claimed that Lucozade was &quot;the worst offender&quot;, containing 62 grams of sugar in a 500 ml bottle, followed by Coca-Cola with 54 grams. Posters for the campaign were displayed in hospitals for a time.

In its original high-sugar formulation, Lucozade was recommended by UK diabetes charities as an immediate treatment for hypoglycaemia in individuals who take insulin. Since the drink now includes artificial sweeteners, guidelines have been amended to state that Lucozade should not be used to treat diabetic hypoglycaemia.

==Composition==
While the ingredients vary somewhat from one drink to another, those of the Lucozade Original Energy were listed as follows in 2013: carbonated water, glucose syrup (25%), citric acid (E330), lactic acid (E270), flavouring (unspecified), preservatives (potassium sorbate, sodium bisulphite (E-222)), caffeine, antioxidant (ascorbic acid), colour (sunset yellow (E110), Ponceau 4R). After the reformulation to lower sugar in 2017, and another reformulation in 2023, Lucozade Original contains the sweeteners sucralose and acesulfame K.

A warning is printed on the packaging that the colouring may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.

Packaging also warns that spilt Lucozade may stain. A 380 ml bottle of Lucozade contains 46 mg of caffeine, about as much as a cup of tea.

Lucozade contains 0.01% ethanol (alcohol), which meant that observant Muslims could not drink it. However, in 2004, the Muslim Council of Britain ruled that they saw no harm in consuming Lucozade which contains traces of ethyl alcohol that do not bear its original qualities and do not change the taste, colour or smell. GlaxoSmithKline pointed out that fruit juices and bread could also contain the same or higher trace amounts of alcohol due to natural fermentation.

<text>A food allergy is an abnormal immune response to food. The symptoms of the allergic reaction may range from mild to severe. They may include itchiness, swelling of the tongue, vomiting, diarrhea, hives, trouble breathing, or low blood pressure. This typically occurs within minutes to several hours of exposure. When the symptoms are severe, it is known as anaphylaxis. A food intolerance and food poisoning are separate conditions, not due to an immune response.
Common foods involved include cow&#x27;s milk, peanuts, eggs, shellfish, fish, tree nuts, soy, wheat, and sesame. The common allergies vary depending on the country. Risk factors include a family history of allergies, vitamin D deficiency, obesity, and high levels of cleanliness. Allergies occur when immunoglobulin E (IgE), part of the body&#x27;s immune system, binds to food molecules. A protein in the food is usually the problem. This triggers the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine. Diagnosis is usually based on a medical history, elimination diet, skin prick test, blood tests for food-specific IgE antibodies, or oral food challenge.
Management involves avoiding the food in question and having a plan if exposure occurs. This plan may include giving adrenaline (epinephrine) and wearing medical alert jewelry. Early childhood exposure to potential allergens may be protective against later development of a food allergy. The benefits of allergen immunotherapy for treating food allergies are not proven, thus not recommended . Some types of food allergies among children resolve with age, including those to milk, eggs, and soy; while others such as to nuts and shellfish typically do not.
In the developed world, about 4% to 8% of people have at least one food allergy. They are more common in children than adults and appear to be increasing in frequency. Male children appear to be more commonly affected than females. Some allergies more commonly develop early in life, while others typically develop in later life. In developed countries, more people believe they have food allergies when they actually do not have them.
== Signs and symptoms ==

Food allergy symptoms occur within minutes to hours after exposure and may include:
* Rash
* Hives
* Itching of mouth, lips, tongue, throat, eyes, skin, or other areas
* Swelling (angioedema) of lips, tongue, eyelids, or the whole face
* Difficulty swallowing
* Runny or congested nose
* Hoarse voice
* Wheezing and/or shortness of breath
* Diarrhea, abdominal pain, and/or stomach cramps
* Lightheadedness
* Fainting
* Nausea
* Vomiting

In some cases, however, onset of symptoms may be delayed for hours.

Symptoms can vary. The amount of food needed to trigger a reaction also varies.

Serious danger regarding allergies can begin when the respiratory tract or blood circulation is affected. The former can be indicated through wheezing and cyanosis. Poor blood circulation leads to a weak pulse, pale skin and fainting.

A severe case of an allergic reaction, caused by symptoms affecting the respiratory tract and blood circulation, is called anaphylaxis. When symptoms are related to a drop in blood pressure, the person is said to be in anaphylactic shock. Anaphylaxis occurs when IgE antibodies are involved, and areas of the body that are not in direct contact with the food become affected and show symptoms. Those with asthma or an allergy to peanuts, tree nuts, or seafood are at greater risk for anaphylaxis.

==Causes==

=== Common food allergies ===
Allergic reactions are abnormal immune responses that develop after exposure to a given food allergen. Food allergens account for about 90% of all allergic reactions. The most common food allergens include milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, soy, and wheat, which are referred to as &quot;the big eight&quot;, and are required by US law to be on labels of foods that contain those foods. In April 2021, President Biden signed the FASTER Act into law. This recognized sesame as the ninth US mandatory food label allergen.

Peanuts, a member of the legume family, are one of the most common food allergens that induce reactions in both children and adults. Affecting about 2% of the Western population, peanut allergies tend to cause more severe reactions and anaphylaxis than other food allergies. Tree nuts, including almonds, brazil nuts, cashews, coconuts, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, pecans, pistachios, pine nuts, and walnuts, are also common allergens. Affected individuals may be sensitive to one particular tree nut or many different ones. Peanuts and seeds, including sesame seeds and poppy seeds, can be processed to extract oils, but trace amounts of protein may also elicit an allergic reaction. Peanut and tree nut allergies are lifelong conditions for the majority of those affected, although evidence shows that ~20% of those with peanut allergies and 9% of those with tree nut allergies may outgrow them.

Egg allergies affect about one in 50 children but are frequently outgrown when children reach age five. Affected individuals can be sensitive to proteins both in the egg white and egg yolk, but most children are allergic to those in the white while most adults are allergic to those in the yolk.

Cow&#x27;s milk is the most common food allergen in infants and young children, yet many adults are also sensitized to cow&#x27;s milk. Many affected individuals cannot tolerate dairy products such as cheese and yogurt. A small portion of children with milk allergy, roughly 10%, have a reaction to beef because it contains small amounts of protein that are also present in cow&#x27;s milk.

Shellfish, which are divided into crustaceans (shrimp, crab, lobster, etc.) and mollusks (mussel, oyster, scallop, squid, octopus, snail, etc.), are the most common food allergy in adults. People may be allergic to other types of seafood, such as fish. Fish allergies were found to be more common in countries that have high fish consumption compared to those with lower consumption.

Other common food allergens include soy and wheat. Those allergic to wheat may be sensitized to any protein in the wheat kernel. To a lesser frequency, people may be mildly allergic to raw fruits and vegetables, a disease known as oral allergy syndrome. Less common allergens include maize, spices, synthetic and natural colors, and chemical additives.

Balsam of Peru, which is in various foods, is in the &quot;top five&quot; allergens most commonly causing patch test reactions in people referred to dermatology clinics.

=== Routes of exposure ===
Exposure to certain food proteins triggers the production of antigen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies, which, if unaccompanied by allergic symptoms, is known as allergic sensitization. Oral ingestion is the main sensitization route for most food allergy cases, yet other routes of exposure include inhalation and skin contact.

For example, inhaling airborne particles in a farm-scale or factory-scale peanut shelling/crushing environment, or from cooking, can induce respiratory effects in allergic individuals. Furthermore, peanut allergies are much more common in adults who had oozing and crusted skin rashes as infants, suggesting that impaired skin may be a risk factor for sensitization. An estimated 28.5 million people worldwide are engaged in the seafood industry, which includes fishing, aquaculture, processing and industrial cooking. In these occupational settings, individuals with fish and shellfish allergies are at high risk of exposure to allergenic proteins via aerosolization. Respiratory symptoms may be induced by inhalation of wet aerosols from fresh fish handling, inhalation of dry aerosols from fishmeal processing, and dermal contact through skin breaks and cuts. Another occupational food allergy that involves respiratory symptoms is &quot;baker&#x27;s asthma,&quot; which commonly develops in food service workers who work with baked goods. Previous studies detected 40 allergens from wheat, some cross-reacted with rye proteins and a few cross-reacted with grass pollens.

Allergic sensitization can occur via skin antigen exposure, which usually manifests as hives. The skin has been suggested to be a critical sensitization route for peanut-allergic individuals. Peanut allergies are much more common in adults who had oozing and crusted skin rashes as infants, reinforcing that those with disrupted epithelial barriers, notably the skin barrier, are more prone to skin sensitization. Environmental factors, such as exposure to food, microorganisms, creams, and detergents, may lead to skin barrier dysfunction. Several studies reveal that children exposed to skin creams containing peanut oil are reported to have a higher risk of peanut allergy, suggesting that impaired skin may be a risk factor for sensitization.

=== Cross-Contamination ===
Cross-contamination of food occurs when allergens are unintentionally transferred from one food item to another, often through shared cooking equipment, not properly cleaned surfaces, or utensils. This can lead to severe allergic reactions in individuals with food allergies, even if the allergen is present in trace amounts. To mitigate risks, food labeling regulations such as in the United States, require manufacturers to clearly indicate potential allergens on packaging, often with statements like &quot;may contain&quot; or &quot;processed in a facility that handles.&quot; Proper handling practices, such as thorough cleaning and separation of allergen-free foods, are essential in both commercial and home kitchens to prevent cross-contact and ensure safety for those with food allergies.

===Atopy===
Food allergies develop more easily in people with the atopic syndrome, a very common combination of diseases: allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis, eczema, and asthma. The syndrome has a strong inherited component; a family history of allergic diseases can be indicative of the atopic syndrome.

===Cross-reactivity===
Some children who are allergic to cow&#x27;s milk protein also show a cross-sensitivity to soy-based products. Some infant formulas have their milk and soy proteins hydrolyzed, so when taken by infants, their immune systems do not recognize the allergen and they can safely consume the product. Hypoallergenic infant formulas can be based on proteins partially predigested to a less antigenic form. Other formulas, based on free amino acids, are the least antigenic and provide complete nutritional support in severe forms of milk allergy.

Crustaceans (shrimp, crab, lobster, etc.) and molluscs (mussel, oyster, scallop, squid, octopus, snail, etc.) are different invertebrate classes, but the allergenic protein tropomyosin is present and responsible for cross-reactivity.

People with latex allergy often also develop allergies to bananas, kiwifruit, avocados, and some other foods.

==Pathophysiology==
Conditions caused by food allergies are classified into three groups according to the mechanism of the allergic response:

# IgE-mediated (classic) – the most common type, occurs shortly after eating and may involve anaphylaxis.
# Non-IgE mediated – characterized by an immune response not involving immunoglobulin E; may occur some hours after eating, complicating diagnosis
# IgE and/or non-IgE-mediated – a hybrid of the above two types

Allergic reactions are abnormal immune responses to certain substances that are normally harmless. When immune cells encounter the allergenic protein, IgE antibodies are produced; this is similar to the immune system&#x27;s reaction to foreign pathogens. The IgE antibodies identify the allergenic proteins as harmful and initiate the allergic reaction. The harmful proteins are those that do not break down due to the strong bonds of the protein. IgE antibodies bind to a receptor on the surface of the protein, creating a tag, just as a virus or parasite becomes tagged. Why some proteins do not denature and subsequently trigger allergic reactions and hypersensitivity while others do is not entirely clear.

Hypersensitivities are categorized according to the parts of the immune system that are attacked and the amount of time it takes for the response to occur. The four types of hypersensitivity reaction are: type 1, immediate IgE-mediated; type 2, cytotoxic; type 3, immune complex-mediated; and type 4, delayed cell-mediated. The pathophysiology of allergic responses can be divided into two phases. The first is an acute response that occurs immediately after exposure to an allergen. This phase can either subside or progress into a &quot;late-phase reaction&quot; which can substantially prolong the symptoms of a response, and result in tissue damage.

Many food allergies are caused by hypersensitivities to particular proteins in different foods. Proteins have unique properties that allow them to become allergens, such as stabilizing forces in their tertiary and quaternary structures which prevent degradation during digestion. Many theoretically allergenic proteins cannot survive the destructive environment of the digestive tract, thus do not trigger hypersensitive reactions.

===Acute response===

In the early stages of allergy, a type I hypersensitivity reaction against an allergen, encountered for the first time, causes a response in a type of immune cell called a TH2 lymphocyte, which belongs to a subset of T cells that produce a cytokine called interleukin-4 (IL-4). These TH2 cells interact with other lymphocytes called B cells, whose role is the production of antibodies. Coupled with signals provided by IL-4, this interaction stimulates the B cell to begin production of a large amount of a particular type of antibody known as IgE. Secreted IgE circulates in the blood and binds to an IgE-specific receptor (a kind of Fc receptor called FcεRI) on the surface of other kinds of immune cells called mast cells and basophils, which are both involved in the acute inflammatory response. The IgE-coated cells, at this stage, are sensitized to the allergen.

If later exposure to the same allergen occurs, the allergen can bind to the IgE molecules held on the surface of the mast cells or basophils. Cross-linking of the IgE and Fc receptors occurs when more than one IgE-receptor complex interacts with the same allergenic molecule and activates the sensitized cell. Activated mast cells and basophils undergo a process called degranulation, during which they release histamine and other inflammatory chemical mediators (cytokines, interleukins, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins) from their granules into the surrounding tissue causing several systemic effects, such as vasodilation, mucous secretion, nerve stimulation, and smooth-muscle contraction. This results in rhinorrhea, itchiness, dyspnea, and anaphylaxis. Depending on the individual, the allergen, and the mode of introduction, the symptoms can be system-wide (classical anaphylaxis), or localized to particular body systems.

===Late-phase response===
After the chemical mediators of the acute response subside, late-phase responses can often occur due to the migration of other leukocytes such as neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and macrophages to the initial site. The reaction is usually seen 2–24 hours after the original reaction. Cytokines from mast cells may also play a role in the persistence of long-term effects.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis is usually based on a medical history, elimination diet, skin prick test, blood tests for food-specific IgE antibodies, or oral food challenge.
* For skin-prick tests, a tiny board with protruding needles is used. The allergens are placed either on the board or directly on the skin. The board is then placed on the skin, to puncture the skin and for the allergens to enter the body. If a hive appears, the person is considered positive for the allergy. This test only works for IgE antibodies. Allergic reactions caused by other antibodies cannot be detected through skin-prick tests.

Skin-prick testing is easy to do and results are available in minutes. Different allergists may use different devices for testing. Some use a &quot;bifurcated needle&quot;, which looks like a fork with two prongs. Others use a &quot;multitest&quot;, which may look like a small board with several pins sticking out of it. In these tests, a tiny amount of the suspected allergen is put onto the skin or into a testing device, and the device is placed on the skin to prick, or break through, the top layer of skin. This puts a small amount of the allergen under the skin. A hive will form at any spot where the person is allergic. This test generally yields a positive or negative result. It is good for quickly learning if a person is allergic to a particular food or not because it detects IgE. Skin tests cannot predict if a reaction would occur or what kind of reaction might occur if a person ingests that particular allergen. They can, however, confirm an allergy in light of a patient&#x27;s history of reactions to a particular food. Non-IgE-mediated allergies cannot be detected by this method.
* Patch testing is used to determine if a specific substance causes allergic inflammation of the skin. It tests for delayed food reactions.
* Blood testing is another way to test for allergies; however, it poses the same disadvantage and only detects IgE allergens and does not work for every possible allergen. Radioallergosorbent testing (RAST) is used to detect IgE antibodies present to a certain allergen. The score taken from the RAST is compared to predictive values, taken from a specific type of RAST. If the score is higher than the predictive values, a great chance the allergy is present in the person exists. One advantage of this test is that it can test many allergens at one time.

A CAP-RAST has greater specificity than RAST; it can show the amount of IgE present to each allergen. Researchers have been able to determine &quot;predictive values&quot; for certain foods, which can be compared to the RAST results. If a person&#x27;s RAST score is higher than the predictive value for that food, over a 95% chance exists that patients will have an allergic reaction (limited to rash and anaphylaxis reactions) if they ingest that food. Currently, predictive values are available for milk, egg, peanut, fish, soy, and wheat. Blood tests allow for hundreds of allergens to be screened from a single sample, and cover food allergies as well as inhalants. However, non-IgE-mediated allergies cannot be detected by this method. Other widely promoted tests such as the antigen leukocyte cellular antibody test and the food allergy profile are considered unproven methods, the use of which is not advised.
* Food challenges test for allergens other than those caused by IgE allergens. The allergen is given to the person in the form of a pill, so the person can ingest the allergen directly. The person is watched for signs and symptoms. The problem with food challenges is that they must be performed in the hospital under careful watch, due to the possibility of anaphylaxis.

Food challenges, especially double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges, are the gold standard for diagnosis of food allergies, including most non-IgE-mediated reactions, but is rarely done. Blind food challenges involve packaging the suspected allergen into a capsule, giving it to the patient, and observing the patient for signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction.

The recommended method for diagnosing food allergy is to be assessed by an allergist. The allergist will review the patient&#x27;s history and the symptoms or reactions that have been noted after food ingestion. If the allergist feels the symptoms or reactions are consistent with food allergy, he/she will perform allergy tests. Additional diagnostic tools for evaluation of eosinophilic or non-IgE mediated reactions include endoscopy, colonoscopy, and biopsy.

===Differential diagnosis===
Important differential diagnoses are:
* Lactose intolerance generally develops later in life, but can present in young patients in severe cases. It is not an immune reaction and is due to an enzyme deficiency (lactase). It is more common in many non-Western people.
* Celiac disease. While it is caused by a permanent intolerance to gluten (present in wheat, rye, barley and oats), is not an allergy nor simply an intolerance, but a chronic, multiple-organ autoimmune disorder primarily affecting the small intestine.
* Irritable bowel syndrome
* C1 Esterase inhibitor deficiency (hereditary angioedema), a rare disease, generally causes attacks of angioedema, but can present solely with abdominal pain and occasional diarrhea, and thus may be confused with allergy-triggered angioedema.

== Prevention ==
Breastfeeding for more than four months may prevent atopic dermatitis, cow&#x27;s milk allergy, and wheezing in early childhood. Early exposure to potential allergens may be protective. Specifically, early exposure to eggs and peanuts reduces the risk of allergies to these. Guidelines suggest introducing peanuts as early as 4–6 months and include precautionary measures for high-risk infants. The former guidelines, advising delaying the introduction of peanuts, are now thought to have contributed to the increase in peanut allergy seen recently.

To avoid an allergic reaction, a strict diet can be followed. It is difficult to determine the amount of allergenic food required to elicit a reaction, so complete avoidance should be attempted. In some cases, hypersensitive reactions can be triggered by exposures to allergens through skin contact, inhalation, kissing, participation in sports, blood transfusions, cosmetics, and alcohol.

Early introduction of peanut and egg alongside other solids, or by one year of age, may help prevent development of food allergy. Introduction of these allergenic foods within the first year of life appears to be safe. A window of opportunity for the introduction of different food allergens may exist, such as egg introduction ahead of peanut.

===Inhalation exposure===
Allergic reactions to airborne particles or vapors of known food allergens have been reported as an occupational consequence of people working in the food industry, but can also take place in home situations, restaurants, or confined spaces such as airplanes. According to two reviews, respiratory symptoms are common, but in some cases there has been progression to anaphylaxis. The most frequent reported cases of reactions by inhalation of allergenic foods were due to peanut, seafood, legumes, tree nut, and cow&#x27;s milk. Steam rising from cooking of lentils, green beans, chickpeas and fish has been well documented as triggering reactions, including anaphylactic reactions. One review mentioned case study examples of allergic responses to inhalation of other foods, including examples in which oral consumption of the food is tolerated.

== Treatment ==

The mainstay of treatment for food allergy is total avoidance of the foods identified as allergens. An allergen can enter the body by consuming a portion of food containing the allergen, and can also be ingested by touching any surfaces that may have come into contact with the allergen, then touching the eyes or nose. For people who are extremely sensitive, avoidance includes avoiding touching or inhaling problematic food. Total avoidance is complicated because the declaration of the presence of trace amounts of allergens in foods is not mandatory (see regulation of labelling).

If the food is accidentally ingested and a systemic reaction (anaphylaxis) occurs, then epinephrine should be used. A second dose of epinephrine may be required for severe reactions. The person should then be transported to the emergency room, where additional treatment can be given. Other treatments include antihistamines and steroids.

===Epinephrine===

Epinephrine (adrenaline) is the first-line treatment for severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis). If administered in a timely manner, epinephrine can reverse its effects. Epinephrine relieves airway swelling and obstruction, and improves blood circulation; blood vessels are tightened and heart rate is increased, improving circulation to body organs. Epinephrine is available by prescription in an autoinjector.

===Antihistamines===
Antihistamines can alleviate some of the milder symptoms of an allergic reaction, but do not treat all symptoms of anaphylaxis. Antihistamines block the action of histamine, which causes blood vessels to dilate and become leaky to plasma proteins. Histamine also causes itchiness by acting on sensory nerve terminals. The most common antihistamine given for food allergies is diphenhydramine.

===Steroids===
Glucocorticoid steroids are used to calm down the immune system cells that are attacked by the chemicals released during an allergic reaction. This treatment in the form of a nasal spray should not be used to treat anaphylaxis, for it only relieves symptoms in the area in which the steroid is in contact. Another reason steroids should not be used is the delay in reducing inflammation. Steroids can also be taken orally or through injection, by which every part of the body can be reached and treated, but a long time is usually needed for these to take effect.

=== Immunotherapy ===
Immunotherapies seek to condition the immune system to elicit or suppress a specific immune response. In the treatment of allergies, common immunotherapies seek to desensitize the immune system by gradually exposing the body to allergens in increasing amounts. These forms of immunotherapy have had varying and limited success and have generally been used to treat peanut and environmental allergies.

===Omalizumab===
Omalizumab, an injectable asthma treatment drug sold under the brand name Xolair, was approved in the United States in February 2024 to reduce severe reactions to accidental exposure to food allergens. It is a genetically engineered monoclonal antibody which specifically binds to immunoglobulin E (IgE) to reduce the severity of an immune response. Successful results were reported for wheat, eggs, milk and baked products containing wheat and milk.

==Epidemiology==
Food allergies affect up to 10% of the worldwide population, and they are currently more prevalent in children (~8%) than adults (~5) in western nations. In several industrialized countries, food allergies affect up to 10% of children. Children are most commonly allergic to cow&#x27;s milk, chicken eggs, peanuts, and tree nuts. While studies on adults with food allergy are not as abundant, surveys suggest that the most common food allergens for adults include fish, shellfish, peanuts, and tree nuts.

Food allergies have become increasingly prevalent in industrialized/westernized nations over the last 2–3 decades. An estimated 15 million people currently have food allergies in the United States. In 1997, 0.4% children in the United States were reported to have peanut allergy, yet this number markedly rose to 1.4% in 2008. In Australia, hospital admission rates for food-induced anaphylaxis increased by an average of 13.2% from 1994-2005. One possible explanation for the rise in food allergy is the &quot;old friends&quot; hypothesis, which suggests that non-disease-causing organisms, such as helminths, could protect against allergy. Therefore, reduced exposure to these organisms, particularly in developed countries, could have contributed towards the increase.

Children of East Asian or African descent who live in westernized countries were reported to be at significantly higher risk of food allergy compared to Caucasian children. Several studies predict that Asia and Africa may experience a growth in food allergy prevalence as the lifestyles there become more westernized.

The prevalence of certain food allergies is suggested to depend partly on the geographical area and country. For instance, allergy to buckwheat flour, used for soba noodles, is more common in Japan than peanuts, tree nuts or foods made from soy beans. Also, shellfish allergy is the most common cause of anaphylaxis in adults and adolescents particularly in East Asian countries like Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and Thailand. Individuals in East Asia have further developed an allergy to rice, which forms a large part of their diet. Another example is that, out of nine European countries, egg allergy was found to be most prevalent in the UK and least prevalent in Greece.

=== Special population: children ===
About 75% of children who have allergies to milk protein are able to tolerate baked-in milk products, i.e., muffins, cookies, cake, and hydrolyzed formulas. About 50% of children with allergies to milk, egg, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, and wheat will outgrow their allergy by the age of 6. Those who are still allergic by the age of 12 or so have less than an 8% chance of outgrowing the allergy.

===United States===
In the United States, food allergy affects as many as 5% of infants less than three years of age and 3% to 4% of adults. The prevalence of food allergies is rising. Food allergies cause roughly 30,000 emergency room visits and 150 deaths per year.
==Regulation==
Whether rates of food allergy are increasing or not, food allergy awareness has definitely increased, with impacts on the quality of life for children, their parents and their caregivers. In the United States, the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 causes people to be reminded of allergy problems every time they handle a food package, and restaurants have added allergen warnings to menus. The Culinary Institute of America, a premier school for chef training, has courses in allergen-free cooking and a separate teaching kitchen. School systems have protocols about what foods can be brought into the school. Despite all these precautions, people with serious allergies are aware that accidental exposure can easily occur at other peoples&#x27; houses, at school or in restaurants.

===Regulation of labelling===

In response to the risk that certain foods pose to those with food allergies, some countries have responded by instituting labeling laws that require food products to clearly inform consumers if their products contain priority allergens or byproducts of major allergens among the ingredients intentionally added to foods.

The priority allergens vary by country.

There are no labeling laws mandating declaration of the presence of trace amounts in the final product as a consequence of cross-contamination, except in Brazil.

====Ingredients intentionally added====
In the United States, the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 requires companies to disclose on the label whether a packaged food product contains any of these eight major food allergens, added intentionally: cow&#x27;s milk, peanuts, eggs, shellfish, fish, tree nuts, soy and wheat. The eight-ingredient list originated in 1999 from the World Health Organisation Codex Alimentarius Commission. To meet labeling requirements, if an ingredient is derived from one of the required-label allergens, then it must either have its &quot;food sourced name&quot; in parentheses, for example, &quot;Casein (milk),&quot; or as an alternative, there must be a statement separate but adjacent to the ingredients list: &quot;Contains milk&quot; (and any other of the allergens with mandatory labeling). The European Union requires listing for those eight major allergens plus molluscs, celery, mustard, lupin, sesame and sulfites.

In 2018, the US FDA issued a request for information for the consideration of labeling for sesame to help protect people who have sesame allergies. A decision was reached in November 2020 that food manufacturers voluntarily declare that when powdered sesame seeds are used as a previously unspecified spice or flavor, the label be changed to &quot;spice (sesame)&quot; or &quot;flavor (sesame).&quot;

Congress and the President passed a law in April 2021, the &quot;FASTER Act&quot;, stipulating that labeling be mandatory, to be effect January 1, 2023, making it the ninth required food ingredient label.

The Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 applies to packaged foods regulated by the FDA, which does not include poultry, most meats, certain egg products, and most alcoholic beverages. However, some meat, poultry, and egg processed products may contain allergenic ingredients. These products are regulated by the Food Safety and Inspection Service, which requires that any ingredient be declared in the labeling only by its common or usual name. Neither the identification of the source of a specific ingredient in a parenthetical statement nor the use of statements to alert for the presence of specific ingredients, like &quot;Contains: milk&quot;, are mandatory. The act also does not apply to food prepared in restaurants. The EU Food Information for Consumers Regulation 1169/2011 – requires food businesses to provide allergy information on food sold unpackaged, for example, in catering outlets, deli counters, bakeries and sandwich bars.

In the United States, there is no federal mandate to address the presence of allergens in drug products, medicines, or cosmetics.

====Trace amounts as a result of cross-contamination====
The value of allergen labeling other than for intentional ingredients is controversial. This concerns labeling for ingredients present unintentionally as a consequence of cross-contact or cross-contamination at any point along the food chain (during raw material transportation, storage or handling, due to shared equipment for processing and packaging, etc.). Experts in this field propose that if allergen labeling is to be useful to consumers, and healthcare professionals who advise and treat those consumers, ideally there should be agreement on which foods require labeling, threshold quantities below which labeling may be of no purpose, and validation of allergen detection methods to test and potentially recall foods that were deliberately or inadvertently contaminated.

Labeling regulations have been modified to provide for mandatory labeling of ingredients plus voluntary labeling, termed precautionary allergen labeling, also known as &quot;may contain&quot; statements, for possible, inadvertent, trace amount, cross-contamination during production. Precautionary allergen labeling can be confusing to consumers, especially as there can be many variations on the wording of the warning. Precautionary allergen labeling is optional in the United States. , precautionary allergen labeling is regulated only in Switzerland, Japan, Argentina, and South Africa. Argentina decided to prohibit precautionary allergen labeling since 2010 and instead puts the onus on the manufacturer to control the manufacturing process and label only those allergenic ingredients known to be in the products. South Africa does not permit the use of precautionary allergen labeling, except when manufacturers demonstrate the potential presence of allergen due to cross-contamination through a documented risk assessment and despite adherence to Good Manufacturing Practice. In Australia and New Zealand there is a recommendation that precautionary allergen labeling be replaced by guidance from VITAL 2.0 (Vital Incidental Trace Allergen Labeling). A review identified &quot;the eliciting dose for an allergic reaction in 1% of the population&quot; as the threshold reference dose for certain foods (such as cow&#x27;s milk, egg, peanut and other proteins) to provide food manufacturers with guidance for developing precautionary labeling and give consumers a better idea of what might be accidentally in a food product beyond &quot;may contain.&quot; VITAL 2.0 was developed by the Allergen Bureau, a food industry sponsored, non-government organization. The European Union has initiated a process to create labeling regulations for unintentional contamination but is not expected to publish such before 2024.

In Brazil, since April 2016, the declaration of the possibility of cross-contamination is mandatory when the product does not intentionally add any allergenic food or its derivatives, but the Good Manufacturing Practices and allergen control measures adopted are not sufficient to prevent the presence of accidental trace amounts. These allergens include wheat, rye, barley, oats and their hybrids, crustaceans, eggs, fish, peanuts, soybean, milk of all species of mammalians, almonds, hazelnuts, cashew nuts, Brazil nuts, macadamia nuts, walnuts, pecan nuts, pistachios, pine nuts, and chestnuts.

===Genetically modified food===
There is a scientific consensus that available food derived from genetically modified crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, and a 2016 U.S. National Academy of Sciences report concluded that there is no relationship between consumption of genetically modified foods and the increase in prevalence of food allergies. However, there are concerns that genetically modified foods, also described as foods sourced from genetically modified organisms, could be responsible for allergic reactions, and that the widespread acceptance of these types of foods may be responsible for what is a real or perceived increase in the percentage of people with allergies.

One concern is that genetic engineering could make an allergy-provoking food more allergic, meaning that smaller portions would suffice to set off a reaction. Of the food currently in widespread use of genetically modified organisms, only soybeans are identified as a common allergen. However, for the soybean proteins known to trigger allergic reactions, there is more variation from strain to strain than between those and the genetically modified varieties. Another concern is that genes transferred from one species to another could introduce an allergen in a food not thought of as particularly allergenic. Research on an attempt to enhance the quality of soybean protein by adding genes from Brazil nuts was terminated when human volunteers known to have tree nut allergy reacted to the modified soybeans.

Prior to a new genetically modified food receiving government approval, certain criteria need to be met. These include: Is the donor species known to be allergenic? Does the amino acid sequence of the transferred proteins resemble the sequence of known allergenic proteins? Are the transferred proteins resistant to digestion – a trait shared by many allergenic proteins? Genes approved for animal use can be restricted from human consumption due to potential for allergic reactions. In 1998 StarLink brand corn restricted to animals was detected in the human food supply, leading to first a voluntary and then an FDA-mandated recall. There are requirements in some countries and recommendations in others that all foods containing genetically modified ingredients be so labeled, and that there be a post-launch monitoring system to report adverse effects (similar to the requirements in some countries for drug and dietary supplement reporting).

=== Restaurants ===
In the US, the FDA Food Code states that the person in charge in restaurants should have knowledge about major food allergens, cross-contacts, and symptoms of food allergy reactions. Restaurant staff, including wait staff and kitchen staff, may not be adequately informed about allergenic ingredients, or the risk of cross-contact when kitchen utensils used to prepare food may have been in previous contact with an allergenic food. The problem may be compounded when customers have a hard time describing their food allergies or when wait staff have a hard time understanding those with food allergies when taking an order.

=== Diagnosing issues ===
There exists both over-reporting and under-reporting of the prevalence of food allergies. Self-diagnosed perceptions of food allergy are greater than the rates of true food allergy because people confuse non-allergic intolerance with allergy, and also attribute non-allergy symptoms to an allergic response. Conversely, healthcare professionals treating allergic reactions on an out-patient or even hospitalized basis may not report all cases. Recent increases in reported cases may reflect a real change in incidence or an increased awareness on the part of healthcare professionals.

==Social impact==
Food fear has a significant impact on quality of life. For children with allergies, their quality of life is also affected by the actions of their peers. An increased occurrence of bullying has been observed, which can include threats or deliberate acts of forcing allergic children to contact foods that they must avoid or intentional contamination of allergen-free food. The social impacts of food allergies can carry over into adulthood.

==Portrayal in media==
Media portrayals of food allergy in television and film are not accurate, often used for comedic effect or underplaying the potential severity of an allergic reaction. These tropes misinform the public and also contribute to how entertainment media will continue to wrongly portray food allergies in the future. Types of tropes: 1) characters have food allergies, providing a weakness that can be used to sabotage them. In the movie &quot;Parasite&quot; a housekeeper is displaced by taking advantage of her peach allergy. In the animated film &quot;Peter Rabbit&quot;, the farm owner is attacked by being pelted with blackberries, causing an anaphylactic reaction requiring emergency treatment with epinephrine. After many public protests, Sony Pictures and the &quot;Peter Rabbit&quot; director apologized for making light of food allergies. 2) Food allergy is used for comedic effect, such as in the movies &quot;Hitch&quot; and in television, Kelso&#x27;s egg allergy in &quot;That &#x27;70s Show.&quot; 3) Food allergies may be incorporated into characters who are also portrayed as annoying, weak and oversensitive, which can be taken as implying that their allergies are either not real or not potentially severe. In season 1, episode 16 of &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; Howard Wolowitz deliberately consumes a peanut-containing food bar (and has a serious reaction) just to delay Leonard from returning to his apartment where a surprise birthday party is being arranged. 4) Any of these portrayals may underplay the potential severity of food allergy, some showing that Benadryl treatment is sufficient. Viewing of humorous portrayals of food allergies has been shown to have a negative effect on related health policy support due to low perceived seriousness.

==Research==
Several theories have been suggested to explain why certain individuals develop allergic sensitization instead of oral tolerance to food allergens. One such theory is the dual allergen hypothesis, which states that ingesting food allergens early on promotes oral tolerance while skin exposure leads to sensitization. Instead of oral ingestion, skin barrier disruption in conditions like eczema, for instance, was suggested to cause allergic sensitization in animal and human infants. Inhalation was recently proposed to be an additional sensitization route in the dual allergen hypothesis. Another theory is the barrier regulation hypothesis, describing the role of commensal bacteria in preventing the development of food allergy by maintaining integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier. Environmental and lifestyle factors, such as early life nutrition and antibiotic treatment, may contribute to food allergy prevalence by affecting gut microbial composition, and thus, intestinal immune homeostasis in infants and young children.

A number of desensitization techniques are being studied. Areas of research include specific oral tolerance induction (also known as oral immunotherapy), and sublingual immunotherapy. The benefits of allergen immunotherapy for food allergies is unclear, thus is not recommended .

There is research on the effects of increasing intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids during pregnancy, lactation, via infant formula and in early childhood on the subsequent risk of developing food allergies during infancy and childhood. From two reviews, maternal intake of omega-3, long-chain fatty acids during pregnancy appeared to reduce the risks of medically diagnosed IgE-mediated allergy, eczema and food allergy per parental reporting in the first 12 months of life, but the effects were not all sustained past 12 months. The reviews characterized the literature&#x27;s evidence as inconsistent and limited. Results when breastfeeding mothers were consuming a diet high in polyunsaturated fatty acids were inconclusive. For infants, supplementing their diet with oils high in polyunsaturated fatty acids did not affect the risks of food allergies, eczema or asthma either as infants or into childhood.

There is research on probiotics, prebiotics and the combination of the two (synbiotics) as a means of treating or preventing infant and child allergies. From reviews, there appears to be a treatment benefit for eczema, but not asthma, wheezing or rhinoconjunctivitis. The evidence was not consistent for preventing food allergies and this approach cannot yet be recommended.

The Food Standards Agency, in the United Kingdom, are in charge of funding research into food allergies and intolerance. Since their founding in 1994 they have funded over 45 studies. In 2005 Europe created EuroPrevall, a multi-country project dedicated to research involving allergies.

<text>In mathematics, deformation theory is the study of infinitesimal conditions associated with varying a solution &quot;P&quot; of a problem to slightly different solutions &quot;P&quot;ε, where ε is a small number, or a vector of small quantities. The infinitesimal conditions are the result of applying the approach of differential calculus to solving a problem with constraints. The name is an analogy to non-rigid structures that deform slightly to accommodate external forces.

Some characteristic phenomena are: the derivation of first-order equations by treating the ε quantities as having negligible squares; the possibility of &quot;isolated solutions&quot;, in that varying a solution may not be possible, &quot;or&quot; does not bring anything new; and the question of whether the infinitesimal constraints actually &#x27;integrate&#x27;, so that their solution does provide small variations. In some form these considerations have a history of centuries in mathematics, but also in physics and engineering. For example, in the geometry of numbers a class of results called &quot;isolation theorems&quot; was recognised, with the topological interpretation of an &quot;open orbit&quot; (of a group action) around a given solution. Perturbation theory also looks at deformations, in general of operators.

==Deformations of complex manifolds==
The most salient deformation theory in mathematics has been that of complex manifolds and algebraic varieties. This was put on a firm basis by foundational work of Kunihiko Kodaira and Donald C. Spencer, after deformation techniques had received a great deal of more tentative application in the Italian school of algebraic geometry. One expects, intuitively, that deformation theory of the first order should equate the Zariski tangent space with a moduli space. The phenomena turn out to be rather subtle, though, in the general case.

In the case of Riemann surfaces, one can explain that the complex structure on the Riemann sphere is isolated (no moduli). For genus 1, an elliptic curve has a one-parameter family of complex structures, as shown in elliptic function theory. The general Kodaira–Spencer theory identifies as the key to the deformation theory the sheaf cohomology group

: formula_1

where Θ is (the sheaf of germs of sections of) the holomorphic tangent bundle. There is an obstruction in the &quot;H&quot;2 of the same sheaf; which is always zero in case of a curve, for general reasons of dimension. In the case of genus 0 the &quot;H&quot;1 vanishes, also. For genus 1 the dimension is the Hodge number &quot;h&quot;1,0 which is therefore 1. It is known that all curves of genus one have equations of form &quot;y&quot;2 = &quot;x&quot;3 + &quot;ax&quot; + &quot;b&quot;. These obviously depend on two parameters, a and b, whereas the isomorphism classes of such curves have only one parameter. Hence there must be an equation relating those a and b which describe isomorphic elliptic curves. It turns out that curves for which &quot;b&quot;2&quot;a&quot;−3 has the same value, describe isomorphic curves. I.e. varying a and b is one way to deform the structure of the curve &quot;y&quot;2 = &quot;x&quot;3 + &quot;ax&quot; + &quot;b&quot;, but not all variations of &quot;a,b&quot; actually change the isomorphism class of the curve.

One can go further with the case of genus &quot;g&quot; &gt; 1, using Serre duality to relate the &quot;H&quot;1 to

: formula_2

where Ω is the holomorphic cotangent bundle and the notation Ω[2] means the &quot;tensor square&quot; (&quot;not&quot; the second exterior power). In other words, deformations are regulated by holomorphic quadratic differentials on a Riemann surface, again something known classically. The dimension of the moduli space, called Teichmüller space in this case, is computed as 3&quot;g&quot; − 3, by the Riemann–Roch theorem.

These examples are the beginning of a theory applying to holomorphic families of complex manifolds, of any dimension. Further developments included: the extension by Spencer of the techniques to other structures of differential geometry; the assimilation of the Kodaira–Spencer theory into the abstract algebraic geometry of Grothendieck, with a consequent substantive clarification of earlier work; and deformation theory of other structures, such as algebras.

== Deformations and flat maps ==
The most general form of a deformation is a flat map formula_3 of complex-analytic spaces, schemes, or germs of functions on a space. Grothendieck was the first to find this far-reaching generalization for deformations and developed the theory in that context. The general idea is there should exist a universal family formula_4 such that any deformation can be found as a &quot;unique&quot; pullback squareformula_5In many cases, this universal family is either a Hilbert scheme or Quot scheme, or a quotient of one of them. For example, in the construction of the moduli of curves, it is constructed as a quotient of the smooth curves in the Hilbert scheme. If the pullback square is not unique, then the family is only versal.

== Deformations of germs of analytic algebras ==
One of the useful and readily computable areas of deformation theory comes from the deformation theory of germs of complex spaces, such as Stein manifolds, complex manifolds, or complex analytic varieties. Note that this theory can be globalized to complex manifolds and complex analytic spaces by considering the sheaves of germs of holomorphic functions, tangent spaces, etc. Such algebras are of the formformula_6 where formula_7 is the ring of convergent power-series and formula_8 is an ideal. For example, many authors study the germs of functions of a singularity, such as the algebraformula_9representing a plane-curve singularity. A germ of analytic algebras is then an object in the opposite category of such algebras. Then, a deformation of a germ of analytic algebras formula_10 is given by a flat map of germs of analytic algebras formula_3 where formula_12 has a distinguished point formula_13 such that the formula_10 fits into the pullback squareformula_15These deformations have an equivalence relation given by commutative squaresformula_16where the horizontal arrows are isomorphisms. For example, there is a deformation of the plane curve singularity given by the opposite diagram of the commutative diagram of analytic algebrasformula_17In fact, Milnor studied such deformations, where a singularity is deformed by a constant, hence the fiber over a non-zero formula_18 is called the Milnor fiber.

=== Cohomological Interpretation of deformations ===
It should be clear there could be many deformations of a single germ of analytic functions. Because of this, there are some book-keeping devices required to organize all of this information. These organizational devices are constructed using tangent cohomology. This is formed by using the Koszul–Tate resolution, and potentially modifying it by adding additional generators for non-regular algebras formula_19. In the case of analytic algebras these resolutions are called the Tjurina resolution for the mathematician who first studied such objects, Galina Tyurina. This is a graded-commutative differential graded algebra formula_20 such that formula_21 is a surjective map of analytic algebras, and this map fits into an exact sequenceformula_22Then, by taking the differential graded module of derivations formula_23, its cohomology forms the tangent cohomology of the germ of analytic algebras formula_19. These cohomology groups are denoted formula_25. The formula_26 contains information about all of the deformations of formula_19 and can be readily computed using the exact sequenceformula_28If formula_19 is isomorphic to the algebraformula_30then its deformations are equal toformula_31were formula_32 is the jacobian matrix of formula_33. For example, the deformations of a hypersurface given by formula_34 has the deformationsformula_35For the singularity formula_36 this is the moduleformula_37hence the only deformations are given by adding constants or linear factors, so a general deformation of formula_38 is formula_39 where the formula_40 are deformation parameters.

==Functorial description==
Another method for formalizing deformation theory is using functors on the category formula_41 of local Artin algebras over a field. A pre-deformation functor is defined as a functor
:formula_42
such that formula_43 is a point. The idea is that we want to study the infinitesimal structure of some moduli space around a point where lying above that point is the space of interest. It is typically the case that it is easier to describe the functor for a moduli problem instead of finding an actual space. For example, if we want to consider the moduli-space of hypersurfaces of degree formula_44 in formula_45, then we could consider the functor
:formula_46
where
:formula_47

Although in general, it is more convenient/required to work with functors of groupoids instead of sets. This is true for moduli of curves.

===Technical remarks about infinitesimals===
Infinitesimals have long been in use by mathematicians for non-rigorous arguments in calculus. The idea is that if we consider polynomials formula_48 with an infinitesimal formula_49, then only the first order terms really matter; that is, we can consider
:formula_50
A simple application of this is that we can find the derivatives of monomials using infinitesimals:
:formula_51
the formula_49 term contains the derivative of the monomial, demonstrating its use in calculus. We could also interpret this equation as the first two terms of the Taylor expansion of the monomial. Infinitesimals can be made rigorous using nilpotent elements in local artin algebras. In the ring formula_53 we see that arguments with infinitesimals can work. This motivates the notation formula_54, which is called the ring of dual numbers. 

Moreover, if we want to consider higher-order terms of a Taylor approximation then we could consider the artin algebras formula_55. For our monomial, suppose we want to write out the second order expansion, then
:formula_56
Recall that a Taylor expansion (at zero) can be written out as
:formula_57
hence the previous two equations show that the second derivative of formula_58 is formula_59.

In general, since we want to consider arbitrary order Taylor expansions in any number of variables, we will consider the category of all local artin algebras over a field.

===Motivation===
To motivate the definition of a pre-deformation functor, consider the projective hypersurface over a field
:formula_60
If we want to consider an infinitesimal deformation of this space, then we could write down a Cartesian square
:formula_61
where formula_62. Then, the space on the right hand corner is one example of an infinitesimal deformation: the extra scheme theoretic structure of the nilpotent elements in formula_63 (which is topologically a point) allows us to organize this infinitesimal data. Since we want to consider all possible expansions, we will let our predeformation functor be defined on objects as
:formula_64
where formula_19 is a local Artin formula_66-algebra.

===Smooth pre-deformation functors===
A pre-deformation functor is called smooth if for any surjection formula_67 such that the square of any element in the kernel is zero, there is a surjection
:formula_68
This is motivated by the following question: given a deformation
:formula_69
does there exist an extension of this cartesian diagram to the cartesian diagrams
:formula_70
the name smooth comes from the lifting criterion of a smooth morphism of schemes.

===Tangent space===
Recall that the tangent space of a scheme formula_71 can be described as the formula_72-set
:formula_73

where the source is the ring of dual numbers. Since we are considering the tangent space of a point of some moduli space, we can define the tangent space of our (pre-)deformation functor as
:formula_74

== Applications of deformation theory ==

=== Dimension of moduli of curves ===
One of the first properties of the moduli of algebraic curves formula_75 can be deduced using elementary deformation theory. Its dimension can be computed asformula_76for an arbitrary smooth curve of genus formula_77 because the deformation space is the tangent space of the moduli space. Using Serre duality the tangent space is isomorphic toformula_78Hence the Riemann–Roch theorem givesformula_79For curves of genus formula_80 the formula_81 becauseformula_82the degree isformula_83and formula_84 for line bundles of negative degree. Therefore the dimension of the moduli space is formula_85.

=== Bend-and-break ===
Deformation theory was famously applied in birational geometry by Shigefumi Mori to study the existence of rational curves on varieties. For a Fano variety of positive dimension Mori showed that there is a rational curve passing through every point. The method of the proof later became known as Mori&#x27;s bend-and-break. The rough idea is to start with some curve &quot;C&quot; through a chosen point and keep deforming it until it breaks into several components. Replacing &quot;C&quot; by one of the components has the effect of decreasing either the genus or the degree of &quot;C&quot;. So after several repetitions of the procedure, eventually we&#x27;ll obtain a curve of genus 0, i.e. a rational curve. The existence and the properties of deformations of &quot;C&quot; require arguments from deformation theory and a reduction to positive characteristic.

===Arithmetic deformations===
One of the major applications of deformation theory is in arithmetic. It can be used to answer the following question: if we have a variety formula_86, what are the possible extensions formula_87? If our variety is a curve, then the vanishing formula_88 implies that every deformation induces a variety over formula_89; that is, if we have a smooth curve
:formula_90
and a deformation
:formula_91
then we can always extend it to a diagram of the form
:formula_92

This implies that we can construct a formal scheme formula_93 giving a curve over formula_89.
=== Deformations of abelian schemes ===

The Serre–Tate theorem asserts, roughly speaking, that the deformations of abelian scheme &quot;A&quot; is controlled by deformations of the &quot;p&quot;-divisible group formula_95 consisting of its &quot;p&quot;-power torsion points.

=== Galois deformations ===

Another application of deformation theory is with Galois deformations. It allows us to answer the question: If we have a Galois representation
:formula_96
how can we extend it to a representation
:formula_97

==Relationship to string theory==
The so-called Deligne conjecture arising in the context of algebras (and Hochschild cohomology) stimulated much interest in deformation theory in relation to string theory (roughly speaking, to formalise the idea that a string theory can be regarded as a deformation of a point-particle theory). This is now accepted as proved, after some hitches with early announcements. Maxim Kontsevich is among those who have offered a generally accepted proof of this.

<doc id="679353" wikidata="Q6510522" url="?curid=679353" title="Leave (U.S. military)">
<text>In the United States&#x27;s military, leave is permission to be away from one&#x27;s unit for a specific period of time. This includes all six service branches of the military and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

== Entitlement ==
Under normal circumstances, all personnel are granted 30 days of leave per year. This time is usually used for vacations and other extended time periods away from the service that are longer than three days or need to be taken in the middle of the week. Leave is accumulated at the rate of 2.5 days per month. A member&#x27;s leave is annotated in the monthly Leave and Earnings Statement.

Under , civilian federal employees who are reservists are allowed “15 days” of annual paid leave for reserve or National Guard training. Prior to 2000, the Justice Department, as had other federal agencies, included days employees were not scheduled to work but would be at reserve training when calculating how much leave an employee used. This miscalculation resulted in the federal appeal of &quot;Butterbaugh v. Department of Justice&quot;, 336 F.3d 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2003). The Butterbaugh Decision changed things for these reservists and would result in many more federal employees finding their reservist time wrongly charged.

== Leave and passes ==
Leave and passes are terms to describe days off work. A typical weekend day off is also known as a regular pass. Up to four consecutive days off can be either leave days or pass days. Leave days are deducted from the Service Member&#x27;s 30 annual days off. Pass days are not deducted. Five or more days off must be deducted as leave. Leave and pass days can now be taken consecutively, as long as the Service Member is in the local area to sign back in from or on leave; for example, a Service Member may put in for a 4-day pass over the 4th of July weekend, and utilize leave starting the day after the 4-day weekend, as long as the service member personally signs in or out on leave.

If leave is taken through a weekend, Saturday and Sunday are also deducted as leave days. For example, a Service Member who takes leave from Thursday to the following Tuesday will be deducted six days of leave for Thursday, Friday, &quot;Saturday, Sunday,&quot; Monday, and Tuesday.

Passes can also be awarded to Service Members for particular achievements. Although passes may be taken for up to 4 days, 3 day passes are granted on most occasions. When 3 day passes are awarded, they are most commonly taken over a weekend giving the Service Member one duty day off. There is a process in getting a leave pass for the Service Member which will be charged by the Department.

One or 2 day passes can also be granted for exceptional circumstances during the duty week; for example, a Service Member can be given a pass for a Wednesday in order to accompany their several children for school physicals, or a Wednesday-Thursday if the Service Member is having to travel overnight for an appointment or event.

== Absent without leave ==
Absent without leave (AWOL) is considered employee misconduct and an attendance issue. This means a Service Member is absent from his/her assigned duty and the absences was not authorized and/or was denied.

== Types of leave ==
The four most common types of leave are:
*Ordinary leave which is regular chargeable leave time.
*Emergency leave which is processed more quickly due to an emergency situation but still treated as chargeable leave.
*Convalescent leave which is non-chargeable and only allowed with a doctor&#x27;s signature that states the servicemember cannot return to duty for an extended period of time.
*Excess Leave (see AR 600-8-10)
*Permissive TDY (Temporary Duty), which is non-chargeable and is only used while traveling between stations while using their leave for government related purposes. Servicemembers using PTDY (Permissive TDY) are not charged while on leave but are also not granted travel pay. Permissive TDY is typically used when PCSing (Permanent Change of Station) and can be granted to a service member when looking for a place to live. Typically for only 10 days.

== Rollover ==
Leave time will &quot;rollover&quot; from year to year. A servicemember may carry up to 60 days of leave before he or she must take it. Leave in excess of 60 days is known as &quot;Use or Lose&quot;: if the servicemember does not use the excess leave by October 1 (the beginning of the new fiscal and training year), he or she will lose it (this was extended from 60 days to 75 from June 27, 2008 until 30 September 2015). Under certain circumstances, the use or lose threshold may be extended to 80 days, if the member is unable to take leave due to duty requirements, usually because of a deployment. If a servicemember leaves the military without having used all his or her leave time, the unused days are paid for at the member&#x27;s regular rate of pay upon separation. Conversely, though the situation is less common, pay will be deducted as &quot;excess leave&quot; on separation if too many days were taken.

== Block leave ==
Block leave refers to time when most or all of the unit takes leave at the same time (as a &quot;block&quot;). Commonly, block leave time is allowed during the summer and Christmas holidays, and before and after deployments.

== Terminal leave ==
Prior to separation or retirement from the military, a member may take the remainder of the leave accumulated. For instance, if a member&#x27;s separation/retirement date is June 30, and the member has 30 days of leave accrued, the member may go on &quot;terminal leave&quot; beginning June 1. All outprocessing from the service would need to be accomplished prior to June 1. Once entering &quot;terminal leave&quot;, he/she would have no further military duties, but would still collect a paycheck and other entitlements such as basic allowance for housing, basic allowance for subsistence, and medical coverage, through the official separation/retirement date of June 30.

<doc id="679355" wikidata="Q7244079" url="?curid=679355" title="Prince Hoare (younger)">
<text>Prince Hoare (1755 – 22 December 1834) was an English painter, art critic, dramatist and librettist. (&#x27;Prince&#x27; is a given name, not a royal title.) Among many interventions in Britain&#x27;s art scene around 1800, Hoare was active in the Royal Academy as its Secretary for Foreign Correspondence. 

==Life==
Prince Hoare was born in Bath, the son of painter William Hoare and his wife. He was named &#x27;Prince&#x27; after his father&#x27;s brother, a sculptor. He studied art from an early age, and became well known as a painter of portraits and historical scenes. His sister Mary Hoare was also a noted painter. He also became a leading facilitator of art criticism and controversy, beginning with &quot;Inquiry into the Requisite Cultivation and Present State of the Arts of Design in England&quot; (1806). 

Later in his life, Hoare wrote 20 plays. He also compiled the &quot;Memoirs of Granville Sharp&quot; (1820), based on the British abolitionist&#x27;s manuscripts, family documents and material from the African Institution, London.

<doc id="679361" wikidata="Q65122120" url="?curid=679361" title="Varietal">
<text>A varietal wine is a wine made primarily from a single named grape variety, and which typically displays the name of that variety on the wine label. Examples of grape varieties commonly used in varietal wines are Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay and Merlot. Wines that display the name of two or more varieties on their label, such as a Chardonnay-Viognier, are &quot;blends&quot; and not varietal wines. The term is frequently misused in place of vine variety; the term &quot;variety&quot; refers to the vine or grape, while &quot;varietal&quot; refers to the wine produced by a variety.

The term was popularized in the US by Maynard Amerine at the University of California, Davis after Prohibition seeking to encourage growers to choose optimal vine varieties, and later promoted by Frank Schoonmaker in the 1950s and 1960s, ultimately becoming widespread during the California wine boom of the 1970s. Varietal wines are commonly associated with New World wines in general, but there is also a long-standing tradition of varietal labelling in Germany and other German-influenced wine regions including Austria, Alsace, and the Czech Republic.

==Marketing relevance==

The alternatives to the marketing differentiation of wines by grape variety are branded wine, such as Hearty Burgundy, or geographical appellations, such as Champagne or Bordeaux. The poor quality and unknown provenance of many branded wines and the multitude of potentially confusing appellations leaves varietal labeling as perhaps the most popular for quality wines in many markets. This is much less the case in places where appellations have a long and strong tradition, as for instance in France. In the past, the grape variety was very uncommonly mentioned on the labels of French wine bottles, and was forbidden for almost all AOC wines. New World varietal wines from newcomers like Australia and Chile have made a significant dent in traditional French export markets like the UK, and so the French are adopting varietal labeling in some cases, particularly for vin de pays.

==Australia==

Australia has virtually completed a three decade long transition from labelling by style, e.g. &quot;claret&quot;, &quot;burgundy&quot;, &quot;hock&quot;, &quot;chablis&quot; to a varietal system. While this has been done in response to pressure from the EU, particularly France, it has paved the way for growing interest among Australian consumers for so called alternative varietals, such as Pinot grigio / (Pinot gris), Sangiovese and Tempranillo.

==Europe==
Within the European Union, a wine using a varietal label must contain at least 85% of that variety. 85% is a common minimum standard; national regulations may set the limit higher in certain cases, but not lower.

===France===

In most regions of France, terroir is thought to surpass the impact of variety, so almost all French wines traditionally have no variety listed at all, and would in many cases not be allowed for AOC wines. Champagne, for instance, is typically a blend of Chardonnay, Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier, but this is not indicated anywhere on the label. In Alsace, winemakers adopt the German custom of varietal labeling.

In recent years, varietal labels have become more common for French wines. Most of these wines are Vin de pays rather than AOC wines, but varietal names are also seen on some regional AOCs.

==United States==

In the United States, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau regulations specify a minimum variety content of 75% of the labeled grape, for &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; wines, and 51% for &quot;Vitis labrusca&quot; wines. There is no restriction on the identity of the balance. Many states in the United States require specific compositions to qualify for sale under a particular varietal labels. For example, in Oregon, wines subject to its regulation must be identified by the grape variety from which it was made, and certain varietals must contain at least 95% of that variety, although the new &quot;Southern Oregon&quot; sub-AVA allows for the minimum 75% figure.

<text>Kingsbury Water Park is a country park in north Warwickshire, England, not far from Birmingham and lying on the River Tame. It is owned and managed by Warwickshire County Council. It has fifteen lakes situated in over of country park. It is renowned for its birdlife, and is popular with birdwatchers. It is bordered on the western edge by the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal.

==History==

The area which is now Kingsbury Water Park was previously the site of gravel extraction pits that were operated by the Midland Gravel Company. The lakes were created from the craters left behind after the gravel had been taken out. The Water Park was opened on 24 May 1975 with two lakes and 123 acres. It has been expanded over the years and as of 2011 has fifteen lakes in an area covering over 600 acres. The Park welcomed 50,000 visitors in its first year, a number which had expanded to 350,000 in 2007. The Water Park was briefly closed to the public in June 2007 after the area was hit by the worst flooding since the 1930s. At the time it was estimated the floods had caused tens of thousands of pounds&#x27; worth of damage. The Park was opened again once the flooding had subsided.

==Features ==

Throughout the park are a number of bridleways, marked cycle routes and footpaths. There is a cycle hire centre and a variety of opportunities available for water sports, including water skiing, jetskis, power boats, sailing and model boat racing.

There is also a 7¼&quot; gauge ridable miniature railway known as Echills Wood Railway. It is run by enthusiasts, who eventually hope to provide a 2 km loop, running a selection of steam, diesel and electric trains.

In November 2011 a new bird hide was erected by Warwickshire County Council allowing birdwatchers to observe birds in their natural habitat. A previous bird hide had been burnt down in December 2010.

Twelve of the lakes provide the opportunity for angling, offering a variety of coarse angling. 

==Events==
Every Saturday at 9am, the park hosts a free 5-kilometre run, organised by Parkrun. The first Kingsbury Water Parkrun was held on 20 July 2013, with 143 runners. The biggest attendance was 792 runners on 1 January 2019 for the New Year&#x27;s Day Parkrun.

== Children&#x27;s facilities ==

Broomey Croft Children&#x27;s Farm is home to many animals and a play park and is suitable for children of all ages. Situated around the park are a number of play areas, picnic areas and cafés. The park is also home to a bicycle hire centre and has a well established visitor centre and shop.

<doc id="679364" wikidata="Q1983389" url="?curid=679364" title="William Hoare">
<text>William Hoare of Bath (c. 1707 – 12 December 1792) was a British portraitist, painter and printmaker. From c. 1740 to 1759, he was the leading oil portraitist at Bath, Somerset, until Thomas Gainsborough arrived in the town. Noted for his pastels, he was a foundation member of the Royal Academy.

==Life==
Born near Eye, Suffolk, Hoare received a gentleman&#x27;s education in Faringdon and he may be the William Hoare baptised on 9 October 1707 in nearby Little Coxwell. He showed an aptitude for drawing and was sent to London to study under Giuseppe Grisoni, who had left Florence for London in 1715. When Grisoni returned to Italy in 1728, Hoare went with him, travelling to Rome and continuing his studies under the direction of Francesco Imperiali. He remained in Rome for nine years, returning to London in 1737/8.

Failing to establish himself in London, Hoare settled in Bath, an expanding spa town popular with the wealthier classes. He obtained numerous commissions, the most important being for official portraits of social leaders of the day (including George Frideric Handel) and political men (e.g., Prime Ministers Robert Walpole and William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, c.1754). There are several versions of most of these, suggesting that he had a studio, and they were further publicised by the production of mezzotints by leading engravers of the day. Hoare himself was a delicate etcher and published a number of private plates, mostly of family and friends, including a Miss Hoare (probably Mary), Christopher Anstey and the 3rd Duke of Beaufort. His pastels were influenced by Rosalba Carriera.

William Hoare was the first fashionable portraitist to settle in Bath, and he was the leading portraitist there until the arrival of Thomas Gainsborough in 1759. He remained the favourite of his powerful patron the Duke of Newcastle, his family, followers and political associates. Included amongst his other important patrons were the Earls of Pembroke and Chesterfield, and the Duke of Beaufort. With Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds, he was a founding member of the Royal Academy.

Hoare was closely involved with the running of the Royal Mineral Water Hospital in Bath from 1742. He served as a governor of the hospital, his aim was to develop specialist treatments for rheumatic disorders. Where he became acquainted with Bath&#x27;s notable visitors and the neighbouring landed families. Chalmers described him as &#x27;an ingenious and amiable English painter&#x27;. He died at Bath on 10 December 1792. Interred at the vault of St Swithins Church, Bath.

His son, Prince Hoare, achieved fame as a painter and dramatist. His daughter Mary Hoare was also a noted painter.

== Works ==
Hoare&#x27;s oil painting &quot;Dr Oliver and Mr Pierce examining patients with Paralysis, Rheumatism and Leprosy&quot; hung prominently at the Royal Mineral Water Hospital until 2019, when it was transferred to a new building at Bath&#x27;s Royal United Hospital site.

Portrait of Ayuba Suleiman Diallo by William Hoare, was first seen by the public in December 2009 when it came up for auction and sold for over £500,000. The new owner unnamed wished to take it out the country but was stopped due to its national importance.

<doc id="679372" wikidata="Q7143384" url="?curid=679372" title="Pat Dobson">
<text>Patrick Edward Dobson, Jr. (February 12, 1942 – November 22, 2006) was an American right-handed starting pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the Detroit Tigers (1967–69), San Diego Padres (1970), Baltimore Orioles (1971–72), Atlanta Braves (1973), New York Yankees (1973–75) and Cleveland Indians (1976–77). He was best known for being one of four Orioles pitchers to win 20 games in their season.

==Baseball career==
Dobson was born in Depew, New York. He signed with Detroit in . After spending seven years in the minor leagues and winter ball, pitching both in relief and starting, he made his debut with the big team in the season after starting the season 4–1 with a 1.47 ERA in six starts for the AAA Toledo Mud Hens. Dobson would spend the next years as a reliever and spot starter for the Tigers including pitching innings of relief in the team&#x27;s 1968 World Series victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. Unable to claim a spot in the Tigers&#x27; rotation of Mickey Lolich, Denny McLain, Earl Wilson, and Joe Sparma, Dobson was traded to San Diego in along with Dave Campbell for a young Joe Niekro. After going 14–15 with 185 strikeouts and a 3.76 earned run average as the staff ace for the last-place Padres, he was traded along with Tom Dukes to Baltimore for Enzo Hernández, Tom Phoebus, Fred Beene and Al Severinsen on December 1, 1970.

In 1971 Dobson had a winning streak of 12 games (including nine consecutive complete games) and a scoreless inning streak of 23. On September 24, he recorded his 20th win, a 7–0 shutout against the Indians. Dobson posted a 20–8, 187, 2.90 season record, and was part of the Orioles&#x27; &quot;Big Four&quot; pitching staff along with Dave McNally (21–5), Mike Cuellar (20–9), and Jim Palmer (20–10). Baltimore went on to win 101 games, with the distinction of having four 20-game winners in a season; only one other team in MLB history, the Chicago White Sox, have had four 20-game winners. On November 2, 1971, Dobson threw a 2–0 no-hitter against the Yomiuri Giants in Tokyo. It was the first no-hit game in the Japanese-American baseball exhibition history. Dobson was an All-Star in . His 2.65 ERA was a major improvement from his 20-win season, but he went 16–18, tying for the AL lead in losses with Yankee Mel Stottlemyre.

In a transaction primarily driven by the Orioles&#x27; need for a power-hitting catcher, he was dealt along with Davey Johnson, Johnny Oates and Roric Harrison to the Atlanta Braves for Earl Williams and Taylor Duncan on the last day of the Winter Meetings on December 1, 1972. After starting the 1973 season 3–7, Dobson was sent to the Yankees on June 7 for four minor league players (none of whom panned out). Escaping Atlanta, he again blossomed and finished the season with a 9–8 record for the Yankees. Dobson started the 1974 campaign weakly, achieving only a 6–11 record by mid–season. However, Dobson anchored the Yankees&#x27; pitching staff in the second half of the season, finishing with a 19–15 record and a 3.07 ERA, the best numbers that year for a Yankee pitcher. After a slumping 11–14, 4.07 in , Dobson was traded to the Indians, and recovered in with a 16–12, 3.48 record. The season proved to be his last, as Dobson compiled a 3–12, 6.16 record. He was released by the Indians during spring training of 1978.

In his 11-season career Dobson had a record of 122–129, with 1,301 strikeouts, a 3.54 earned run average, 74 complete games, 14 shutouts, 19 saves, and innings pitched in 414 games.

==Later life==
After his playing days, Dobson became a pitching coach for the Brewers, Padres, Royals and Orioles. From 1989 to 1990, he was the manager of the Fort Myers Sun Sox of the Senior Professional Baseball Association, leading the team to a 37–35 record and a playoff berth in his first season and an 11–14 record at the time of the league&#x27;s demise on December 26, 1990. In 1997, Dobson joined the San Francisco Giants organization and worked as an advance major league scout and assistant to general manager Brian Sabean.

In 2006 Dobson died from leukemia in San Diego at the age of 64, one day after being diagnosed with the disease.

This instruction is dated to Moses at Mount Sinai. 

==Maimonides&#x27; prescriptions==
There are halachic rules for the use of each of the three types of tanned skin. According to Maimonides, Torah scrolls must be written on &quot;g&#x27;vil&quot; only on the side on which the hair had grown, and never on &quot;duchsustos&quot; (understood as the half-skin from the flesh side). Phylacteries, if written on &quot;k&#x27;laf&quot;, must be written on the flesh side. A mezuzah, when written on &quot;duchsustos&quot;, must be written on the hair side. It is unacceptable to write on the hair side of &quot;k&#x27;laf&quot; or on the flesh side of &quot;g&#x27;vil&quot; and &quot;duchsustos&quot;.

<doc id="679379" wikidata="Q939880" url="?curid=679379" title="G. William Miller">
<text>George William Miller (March 9, 1925 – March 17, 2006) was an American businessman and investment banker who served as the 65th United States secretary of the treasury from 1979 to 1981. A member of the Democratic Party, he also served as the 11th chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1978 to 1979. Miller was the first person to hold both of those posts.

President Jimmy Carter nominated him to succeed Arthur F. Burns as chairman of the Federal Reserve in 1978. Miller came from a corporate world, rather than from economics or finance, an unusual background for a central bank chairman. However, shortly after his appointment, Miller left the Board of Governors to take position of treasury secretary in the Carter administration, when W. Michael Blumenthal resigned. New York Fed President Paul Volcker was chosen as his successor at the Fed.

==Early life and career==
George William Miller was born in Sapulpa, Oklahoma, in 1925. His family soon moved to Borger, the largest city in Hutchinson County, Texas, where Miller spent his childhood and picked up the accent he would use into adulthood. The nascent town experienced an oil boom up until the Great Depression, during which it underwent extensive development under the Work Projects Administration. Miller&#x27;s father, previously a cab driver, became the town&#x27;s fire chief. After attending Amarillo College for the 1941–1942 school year, he received an appointment to the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, and he graduated from there in 1945 with a B.S. degree in marine engineering. From 1945 to 1949, Miller served as a Coast Guard officer in Asia and on the U.S. West Coast. During his time with the Coast Guard, he met Ariadna Rogojarsky, a Russian emigre; they married in 1946.

After leaving the Coast Guard, Miller enrolled in the Boalt Hall School of Law at the University of California, Berkeley and graduated the top of the class of 1952. From there he joined the law firm of Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore in New York City.

In 1956, Miller joined the rapidly growing Rhode Island–based conglomerate Textron, Inc as an assistant secretary. He became a vice president of the company in 1957, CFO in 1958, and both the COO and company president in 1960. In the following years, Textron&#x27;s sales boomed across a range of consumer goods, industrial equipment, and aerospace products. He became Textron&#x27;s CEO in 1968 and retained that role following his 1974 election as chairman of Textron&#x27;s board of directors. He held these posts until he joined to the Federal Reserve Board. Despite the economy&#x27;s weakening state during his time as CEO, Textron&#x27;s sales grew 65% to $2.8bn as the company operated 180 plants worldwide. This allowed the company&#x27;s sales and net income to keep pace with the decade&#x27;s accelerating inflation (albeit with a temporary dip in inflation-adjusted net income during the 1973-75 recession).

In Providence, Miller was active in the Central Congregational Church.

Miller also forayed into politics and public service. From 1963 to 1965, Miller was Chairman of the Industry Advisory Council of the President&#x27;s Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity. In 1966 and 1967, he was a member of the National Council on the Humanities. Miller also served in the think tank Club of Rome. In 1968, he aided Hubert Humphrey&#x27;s presidential campaign as chairman of a Democratic-leaning business group. He also played a minor role in Jimmy Carter&#x27;s 1976 presidential campaign. After Carter&#x27;s election, Miller chaired the President&#x27;s Committee on HIRE, which tried to explore the issues surrounding veteran employment.

At the time he joined the Washington-based Federal Reserve Board of Governors in 1978, Miller had been a Class B director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston for about eight years (Textron&#x27;s headquarters is in the Boston Fed&#x27;s district), and he was on the board of several corporations. He was also a member of the Business Council and the Business Roundtable, and he was Chairman of both the Conference Board and the National Alliance of Businessmen. He also served on two bilateral international economic councils: the US-USSR Trade and Economic Council and the Polish-US Economic Council.

==Federal Reserve Chairman==

When President Jimmy Carter took office, Nixon-appointee Arthur Burns was the Chairman of the Federal Reserve. President Carter recognized Burns&#x27;s understanding of the business community, but Burns openly criticized the administration, acted against White House objectives, and (contrary to the administration&#x27;s goals) prioritized fighting the era&#x27;s accelerating inflation over unemployment. Consequently, the president asked Vice President Walter Mondale to create a list of candidates to replace Burns when his term as chairman expired. The vice president presented a list of four names. Three (Miller, General Electric&#x27;s Reginald H. Jones, and DuPont&#x27;s Irving S. Shapiro) were successful CEOs of large corporations. These men were connected to Washington and the Carter Administration and in their own ways bridged policy and business. Within four days of receiving the short list, President Carter had narrowed it to Miller and the fourth suggestion: Bruce MacLaury, a trained economist with experience at the Treasury under Paul Volcker, at the Brookings Institution, and in different branches of the Federal Reserve System. When President Carter looked for a successor to Miller as Federal Reserve Chairman in 1979, MacLaury was on the short list again (the CEOs Jones and Shapiro were not). As the president decided between Miller and MacLaury in 1978, the people he consulted (including Jones and Shapiro) unanimously favored Miller given his potential to provide leadership while learning technical details on-the-job. When the president spoke with Miller about the position, Miller expressed concern that he lacked the necessary background but agreed to serve in the role if the president wished it.

In anticipation of the end of Burns&#x27;s term as Fed chairman in March 1978, President Carter announced in December 1977 that Miller was his nominee to replace Burns. The announcement received lukewarm reception as US markets slightly worsened, media coverage expressed uncertainty about the relatively unknown nominee&#x27;s views, and economists&#x27; reactions varied. In this context, Miller sat before the United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs for the first-ever confirmation hearings for a Federal Reserve chairman. Up until this time, the Senate had questioned and voted on the president&#x27;s nominees to the Board of Governors while the US president selected the chairman and vice chairman. Some senators were reserved about Miller and challenged his qualifications, and the questions covered a host of issues like Miller&#x27;s views of the Federal Reserve&#x27;s independence. Miller voiced support for and belief in the Fed&#x27;s independence, which (based on Miller&#x27;s different Senate testimonies) is a position he held before and after his time as the Federal Reserve Chair. Allegations against both Textron and Miller&#x27;s actions as its leader spurred the committee to investigate the company. Following what one senator called the &quot;most detailed nomination hearings&quot; he had ever seen, Miller was vindicated and unanimously approved by the Senate.

Miller succeeded Arthur Burns as Fed Chairman in March 1978. He inherited a high inflation economy, still suffering from the increase in oil prices from OPEC. The change in the Consumer Price Index was 4.9% in 1976 and 6.7% in 1977. In at least one speech, Miller identified inflation as the nation&#x27;s primary domestic challenge since (in his view) it was the chief obstacle preventing full employment. Even so, he did not favor aggressive interest rate action that would jeopardize growth. For example, he supported the FOMC&#x27;s continued policy of placing a tight target range around the federal funds rate that underpins much of the financial system. The modest increases in this target range during Miller&#x27;s tenure did little to rein in inflation. In contrast, Miller&#x27;s successor (Paul Volcker) supported more aggressive action (e.g. targeting a growth rate of monetary aggregates instead of a range for the federal funds rate, which allowed for larger and more rapid changes to the federal funds rate). In fact, Miller repeatedly argued during his first year in office that a recession and higher unemployment would accelerate inflation further. Miller also described the economy as being in &quot;great shape&quot; despite the headwinds caused by inflation and other factors.

During Miller&#x27;s tenure (and arguably in large part due to Miller&#x27;s preferred policies), the dollar&#x27;s value decreased substantially. In November 1978, only 11 months into his term, the dollar had fallen nearly 34% against the German mark and almost 42% against the Japanese yen, prompting the Carter administration to launch a &quot;dollar rescue package&quot; including emergency sales from the U.S. gold stock, borrowing from the International Monetary Fund, and auctions of Treasury securities denominated in foreign currencies. This proved only a short-term fix; although temporarily steadying the dollar, it soon resumed its fall. The portmanteau &quot;stagflation&quot;, the combination of &quot;stagnation&quot; and &quot;inflation&quot;, was used increasingly during this time to describe the high rate of inflation, which failed to spur the economy. Even as the situation worsened, Miller insisted that contractionary policies like an overly aggressive interest rate increase would not fight inflation but rather encourage it while hurting the economy&#x27;s growth.

Miller&#x27;s restraint in fighting inflation caused distress among members of the Carter Administration itself. Treasury Secretary Blumenthal, Inflation Adviser Alfred Kahn, and Chief Presidential Economist Charles Schultze all advocated for increasing the interest rate prior to the April FOMC 1979 meeting, where Miller opposed such measures. Carter had to admonish his own staff over the press leaks used to carry on the dispute.

Miller&#x27;s manner of running the Fed did not endear him to his peers or outside observers. Miller was not perceived as having great prestige; not coming from an economics or Wall Street background, he was seen as an &quot;outsider.&quot; A 2003 article in &quot;The Economist&quot; said that &quot;America&#x27;s central bankers have all made their weight felt across the political sphere, with the possible exception of William Miller, whose brief tenure in 1978-79 was notable for his attempts to ban smoking at the board.&quot;. FOMC members who had historically smoked during meetings disregarded Miller&#x27;s ban. To some extent Miller&#x27;s outsider status was intentional. Miller tried to &quot;run the Fed as if he were still in charge of a corporation,&quot; and he was &quot;much less inclined [than others chairs] to act on his own initiative.&quot; It is rare for the influential chair&#x27;s opinion to not carry the vote at Board of Governors and FOMC meetings, but Miller was outvoted by the Board of Governors at a meeting in 1979 where he opposed an increase in the discount rate, the rate at which the Federal Reserve lends to banks.

Economic historians have generally considered Miller&#x27;s short tenure unsuccessful. The high inflation that Miller did not rein in required harsh &quot;shock therapy&quot; treatment by his successor, Paul Volcker, to bring inflation under control. That action sent the U.S. economy into recession from 1980 to 1982. Steven Beckner, a Federal Reserve analyst, offered a particularly harsh assessment:

==Treasury Secretary==

Miller was Fed chairman for just over a year when Carter appointed him Secretary of the Treasury in August 1979, replacing Michael Blumenthal as part of a major cabinet shuffle in which five Cabinet members were replaced. Carter appointed Paul Volcker to replace Miller. He thus became the first person in history to serve as both Treasury Secretary and Chairman of the Federal Reserve. As Treasury Secretary, Miller is best known for his role on the Chrysler Loan Guarantee Board, which oversaw management of a $1.5 billion loan to rescue the carmaker from bankruptcy. This attracted some controversy as the bailout was thought to reward mismanagement and impede fair trade relations between the United States and Japan. Miller agreed that &quot;The administration does not favor, as a general proposition, government aid to private corporations,&quot; but thought an exception should be made in Chrysler&#x27;s case. Chrysler recovered in the early 1980s and paid off the loan early.

Miller is also known for managing the freezing and partial unfreezing of $12 billion in Iranian funds held in the United States during the Iranian hostage crisis. He also pushed through an accord with labor unions on wage-price guidelines that had been &quot;stalemated for months.&quot;

Miller&#x27;s economic policies failed to contain inflation and had little impact on rising unemployment rates. The poor state of the economy was a major factor in Carter&#x27;s 1980 defeat by Ronald Reagan.

==Later years==
After Carter&#x27;s administration ended, Miller founded G. William Miller &amp; Co., a Washington private investment company that he likened to a discreet, Swiss-style merchant bank. He also served positions on a number of charitable and nonprofit organizations. These included treasurer of the American Red Cross, a trustee and director of the Washington Opera, and chairman of the Washington-based H. John Heinz III Center for Science, Economics and the Environment. He also was chairman and chief executive of Federated Stores Inc. (now Macy&#x27;s, Inc.) from 1990 to 1992.

George William Miller died on March 17, 2006, from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a lung condition, at the age of 81.

<text>Srečko Katanec (; born 16 July 1963) is a Slovenian retired football manager and player. At international level, he was capped for both the Yugoslavia and Slovenia national teams.

A former midfielder, who was also capable of playing as a defender, Katanec is regarded as one of the greatest Slovenian footballers of all time, having represented Yugoslavia at the 1984 and 1988 Summer Olympics, UEFA Euro 1984 and the 1990 FIFA World Cup. After Slovenia&#x27;s independence, Katanec made five appearances for the newly formed Slovenia national team before retiring from professional football.

During his club career, Katanec won a Yugoslav League championship with FK Partizan and was a runner-up of the 1988–89 UEFA Cup with VfB Stuttgart. In his five-year spell with Sampdoria, he won the Serie A championship, the Coppa Italia and the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, as well as finishing as a runner-up in the 1992 European Cup final, losing to Barcelona.

As manager of Slovenia, Katanec led the country to its first major tournament in history after qualifying for the 2000 European Championship and the 2002 FIFA World Cup.

==Playing career==
===Club===
Katanec began playing football at the age of seven with NK Ljubljana. In 1981, he joined Olimpija; in 1985, he joined Dinamo Zagreb; while the next year, he signed with Partizan and was a Yugoslav champion in 1987.

In 1988, Katanec joined VfB Stuttgart in the German Bundesliga. The club reached the 1989 UEFA Cup final, but lost to Diego Maradona&#x27;s Napoli. Katanec played just one season for Stuttgart. In 1989, he signed for Italian Serie A side Sampdoria, where he won the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in his first season. In 1991, Sampdoria won the &quot;Scudetto&quot; as Serie A champions, while the next year, the club reached the 1992 European Cup final, losing to Barcelona. In 1994, he also won the Coppa Italia with Sampdoria under manager Sven-Göran Eriksson.

===International===
Katanec was a member of the Yugoslavia national team for the 1984 European Championship in France, but he has fonder memories of the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, where Yugoslavia team won a bronze medal. He was playing successfully in the qualifying round for 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy so he became the third Slovenian to play at a World Cup, where he appeared in three of Yugoslavia&#x27;s five matches. These would be his last three caps for Yugoslavia. Altogether, he appeared in 31 matches and scored 5 goals.

Katanec played five more matches (and scored a goal) for the independent Slovenia national team, but appeared in only one official match. That was a qualifying round for the 1996 European Championship, on 7 September 1994 in Maribor against Italy. Soon after, his contract with Sampdoria expired and he retired from professional football.

==Managerial career==
Between 1996 and 1997, Katanec was an assistant manager of Drago Kostanjšek at the Slovenia under-21 team. In December 1997, he became a head coach of Gorica, signing a two-and-a-half-year contract. In July 1998, he was announced as the Slovenian national team manager.

With Slovenia, he qualified for the 2000 UEFA European Championship after eliminating Ukraine in the qualifying play-offs, which was the country&#x27;s first-ever appearance at the major tournament. At the tournament, Slovenia earned draws against FR Yugoslavia and Norway, and lost to Spain. Slovenia also managed to qualify for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, where they lost all three matches against Spain, South Africa and Paraguay. After the first game, Katanec had a huge argument with the team&#x27;s star player Zlatko Zahovič, who was sent home. He resigned immediately after the World Cup. On 2 November 2002, he became the new manager of Olympiacos. Under Katanec&#x27;s command, Olympiacos played worse than expected, and on 7 February 2003 the club terminated his contract with immediate effect due to poor performances and a bad atmosphere in the team.

In 2004, Katanec was a candidate to become the national team manager of Croatia; however, Zlatko Kranjčar was chosen instead of him.

On 17 February 2006, Katanec was appointed as Macedonia&#x27;s head coach for the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifiers. Following a mixed set of results in the qualifying campaign for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, including a 1–0 win against Scotland and a 4–0 loss to the Netherlands, Katanec resigned from the position on 6 April 2009. On 23 June 2009, he was presented as a new head coach of the United Arab Emirates national team. He was sacked on 6 September 2011 after two successive defeats in the third round of qualifiers for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

On 31 December 2012, he accepted the offer from the Football Association of Slovenia to become the manager of Slovenia for the second time, and was officially appointed on 4 January 2013. He resigned in October 2017 after failing to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

On 4 September 2018, Katanec was appointed as head coach of the Iraq on a three-year contract. His first major competition was the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, where he managed to achieve what he had failed with Slovenia and the United Arab Emirates, by reaching the knockout stages in a major tournament for the first time, as his Iraq reached the round of 16 before losing to the eventual champions Qatar 1–0. Under his management, Iraq also achieved a notable 2–1 win over neighbour Iran in the 2022 World Cup qualifiers, as well as guiding Iraq to the third round of AFC qualifiers, but due to conflict with the federation over unpaid salaries, Katanec departed as coach in July 2021.

On 27 August 2021, Katanec was appointed as head coach of Uzbekistan on a four-year contract. With Uzbekistan, he reached the quarter-finals of the 2023 AFC Asian Cup, where the team was eliminated on penalties by eventual champions Qatar. Katanec resigned as Uzbekistan head coach in January 2025 due to health problems, and announced his retirement from football.

==Personal life==
Katanec was born in Ljubljana to Croat parents from Međimurje. He has two sons, Svit Oliver and Ian Oskar.

<text>In computational geometry, polygon triangulation is the partition of a polygonal area (simple polygon) into a set of triangles, i.e., finding a set of triangles with pairwise non-intersecting interiors whose union is .

Triangulations may be viewed as special cases of planar straight-line graphs. When there are no holes or added points, triangulations form maximal outerplanar graphs.

== Polygon triangulation without extra vertices ==
Over time, a number of algorithms have been proposed to triangulate a polygon.

=== Special cases ===

It is trivial to triangulate any convex polygon in linear time into a fan triangulation, by adding diagonals from one vertex to all other non-nearest neighbor vertices.

The total number of ways to triangulate a convex &quot;n&quot;-gon by non-intersecting diagonals is the (&quot;n&quot;−2)nd Catalan number, which equals
:formula_1,
a formula found by Leonhard Euler.

A monotone polygon can be triangulated in linear time with either the algorithm of A. Fournier and D.Y. Montuno, or the algorithm of Godfried Toussaint.

=== Ear clipping method ===

One way to triangulate a simple polygon is based on the two ears theorem, as the fact that any simple polygon with at least 4 vertices without holes has at least two &quot;ears&quot;, which are triangles with two sides being the edges of the polygon and the third one completely inside it. The algorithm then consists of finding such an ear, removing it from the polygon (which results in a new polygon that still meets the conditions) and repeating until there is only one triangle left.

This algorithm is easy to implement, but slower than some other algorithms, and it only works on polygons without holes. An implementation that keeps separate lists of convex and concave vertices will run in time. This method is known as &quot;ear clipping&quot; and sometimes &quot;ear trimming&quot;. An efficient algorithm for cutting off ears was discovered by Hossam ElGindy, Hazel Everett, and Godfried Toussaint.

=== Monotone polygon triangulation ===
A simple polygon is monotone with respect to a line , if any line orthogonal to intersects the polygon at most twice. A monotone polygon can be split into two monotone &quot;chains&quot;. A polygon that is monotone with respect to the y-axis is called &quot;y-monotone&quot;. A monotone polygon with vertices can be triangulated in time. Assuming a given polygon is y-monotone, the greedy algorithm begins by walking on one chain of the polygon from top to bottom while adding diagonals whenever it is possible. It is easy to see that the algorithm can be applied to any monotone polygon.

=== Triangulating a non-monotone polygon ===
If a polygon is not monotone, it can be partitioned into monotone subpolygons in time using a sweep-line approach. The algorithm does not require the polygon to be simple, thus it can be applied to polygons with holes.
Generally, this algorithm can triangulate a planar subdivision with vertices in time using space.

=== Dual graph of a triangulation ===
A useful graph that is often associated with a triangulation of a polygon is the dual graph. Given a triangulation of , one defines the graph as the graph whose vertex set are the triangles of , two vertices (triangles) being adjacent if and only if they share a diagonal. It is easy to observe that is a tree with maximum degree 3.

=== Computational complexity ===
Until 1988, whether a simple polygon can be triangulated faster than time was an open problem in computational geometry. Then, discovered an -time algorithm for triangulation, later simplified by . Several improved methods with complexity (in practice, indistinguishable from linear time) followed.

Bernard Chazelle showed in 1991 that any simple polygon can be triangulated in linear time, though the proposed algorithm is very complex. A simpler randomized algorithm with linear expected time is also known.

Seidel&#x27;s decomposition algorithm and Chazelle&#x27;s triangulation method are discussed in detail in .

The time complexity of triangulation of an -vertex polygon &quot;with&quot; holes has an lower bound, in algebraic computation tree models of computation. It is possible to compute the number of distinct triangulations of a simple polygon in polynomial time using dynamic programming, and (based on this counting algorithm) to generate uniformly random triangulations in polynomial time. However, counting the triangulations of a polygon with holes is #P-complete, making it unlikely that it can be done in polynomial time.

== Related objects and problems ==
* Both triangulation problems are a special case of triangulation (geometry) and a special case of polygon partition.
* Minimum-weight triangulation is a triangulation in which the goal is to minimize the total edge length.
* A point-set triangulation is a polygon triangulation of the convex hull of a set of points. A Delaunay triangulation is another way to create a triangulation based on a set of points.
* The associahedron is a polytope whose vertices correspond to the triangulations of a convex polygon.
* Polygon triangle covering, in which the triangles may overlap.
* Tiling by polygons, where the goal is to cover the entire plane with polygons of pre-specified shapes.

<text>Faxaflói (), sometimes Faxa Bay, Faxe Bay or Faxi Bay, is a bay in southwest Iceland, between the peninsulas of Snæfellsnes and Reykjanes.

==Name==
The name &quot;Faxaflói&quot; means &#x27;Faxi&#x27;s Bay&#x27; or &#x27;Faxe&#x27;s Bay&#x27;. The first part, &quot;Faxa&quot;, is the genitive of the name &quot;Faxi&quot; or &quot;Faxe&quot;, referring to a man on one of the first Norse boat trips to the island.

==Geography==

The capital of the island, Reykjavík, is situated on its southern shore within the minor fjord Kollafjörður. From Reykjavik it is possible to see the peninsula of Akranes in the northeast and even the Snæfellsjökull at a distance of about . This bay has few islands and the ones it does have are close to land, in particular contrast to the bay directly north of it, Breiðafjörður, which has the most islands of any bay in Iceland.

=== Islands in Faxaflói Bay near Reykjavík ===
==History==
Faxa Bay has always been a source of nourishment of the people living on its shore. In former times, fishermen went out in small boats to fish near the shore. Today the ships are much larger, but have to go further out to sea if they wish to catch fish. Just north of Reykjavík in Kollafjörður is the small island Viðey. In modern times, it has been uninhabited since 1943, but a former settlement has been proven from the 10th century onward. During the 12th century, a chapel was constructed, and a monastery was founded in 1225, existing until the Protestant Reformation at the end of the 16th century. The island and the remains of the settlement can be visited by taking a ferry from Reykjavík harbour.

<text>The hypoglossal nucleus is a cranial nerve nucleus, found within the medulla. Being a motor nucleus, it is close to the midline. In the open medulla, it is visible as what is known as the &quot;hypoglossal trigone&quot;, a raised area (medial to the vagal trigone) protruding slightly into the fourth ventricle.

The hypoglossal nucleus is located between the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and the midline of the medulla. Axons from the hypoglossal nucleus pass anteriorly through the medulla forming the hypoglossal nerve which exits between the pyramid and olive in a groove called the anterolateral sulcus.

<text>Lethbridge is an Australian R&amp;B group from Brisbane, Queensland. It consists of the four Kereama brothers namely Levi Kereama, Jules Kereama, Ezra Kereama and Lane Kereama. The group formed in 1997 and earned a support slot for Boyz II Men on an Australian tour.

However, it was when Levi Kereama was a finalist on &quot;Australian Idol&quot; in 2003 that their career took off. The group&#x27;s debut single, &quot;In My Room&quot;, debuted in the ARIA Australian Top 40 singles charts in May 2004.

On 4 October 2008, Levi Kereama was found dead after falling from a Brisbane hotel building, where he had been staying after performing at the Parklife Festival earlier that day. It has been reported that he had depression, though denied by his family. Queensland Police treated the death as non-suspicious.

<text>Raimond &quot;Rai&quot; Gaita (born Raimund Joseph Gaita; 14 May 1946) is a German-born Australian philosopher and writer, best known for his 1998 biography about his early life, titled &quot;Romulus, My Father&quot;. He was foundation professor of philosophy at the Australian Catholic University, and professor of moral philosophy at King&#x27;s College London.

==Early life and education ==
Raimond Joseph Gaita (born Raimund) was born in Dortmund, Westphalia, Germany, on 14 May 1946, to a Yugoslav-born Romanian father, Romulus Gaiță (28 December 1922May 1996) and a German mother, Christine (&quot;Christel&quot;) Anna Dörr (16 November 19281958). In Germany, from 1942 to 1945, Romulus was employed as a smith and metal worker. The Gaita family migrated to Australia from Yugoslavia in April 1950, just before Raimond turned four. 

The family lived in an isolated shack in the Victorian countryside. His father, along with his father&#x27;s best friend Pantelimon Hora, were strong moral influences during his childhood. His mother suffered from an undiagnosed mental illness, which caused her to be promiscuous, and she started a relationship with Hora&#x27;s brother. Raimund was exposed to several traumas as a child, including the suicide of his mother in 1958.

He attended Baringhup Primary School, St. Patrick&#x27;s College, Ballarat and Melbourne High School in Melbourne, graduating in 1963. In 1968 he graduated from the University of Melbourne (BA Hons, Philosophy), before earning an MA (First Class Honours) there in 1972.

In 1983 he received a PhD from the University of Leeds in England.

==Career ==
===Academia===
From 1970 to 1972 Gaita lectured in philosophy, Melbourne Teachers&#x27; College, and the following year moved to England and started work as a tutor at Leeds University, which he did until 1975. From 1976 he lectured at the University of Kent at Canterbury, before being appointed to King&#x27;s College London in 1977, a position he maintained for 12 years until 1999. 

During this time, he was appointed Foundation Research Professor of Philosophy at the Institute of
Advanced Research at the Australian Catholic University (ACU) in 1993, a title he retained 1998, becoming Foundation Professor of Philosophy, at ACU from 1999 until 2011. Also from 1999 to 2011, he was Professor of Moral Philosophy at King&#x27;s College London London. 

In 2012 he was appointed emeritus professor of moral philosophy at King&#x27;s College London, as well as professorial fellow in the Melbourne Law School and at the Faculty of Arts at the University of Melbourne. TFrom 2019, he has been Honorary Professorial Fellow at Melbourne Law School. 

He regards philosophy as a vocation rather than a career.

===Writing===
The story of his childhood and the lives of Gaita&#x27;s family members and close friends is told in his memoir &quot;Romulus, My Father&quot;. He wrote it over a few weeks after Gaita gave the eulogy at his father&#x27;s funeral, and after its publication in 1998 it became an instant bestseller.

He has also written many books and articles on moral philosophy.

In November 2023, he published &quot;Justice And Hope: Essays, Lectures and Other Writings&quot;, in which he covers topics from Donald Trump to asylum seekers in Australia to reconciliation, Edited by Scott Stephens, some of the writings in this collection date from the 1990s, but all are relevant to today&#x27;s world. With this book he hoped to reach the younger generation and show that &quot;the world is good despite all the suffering in it&quot;. He dedicated the book to his grandchildren.

==Other activities==
As a public intellectual, Gaita has contributed to public debate about reconciliation, collective responsibility, the role of morality in politics, the Holocaust, genocide, crimes against humanity, and educational topics.

Until around 2015, Gaita hosted a series of public lectures given by other philosophers, first at Australian Catholic University and then at the University of Melbourne, called &quot;The Wednesday Lectures&quot;. He has a strong belief in having conversations with others &quot;not when you&#x27;ve done your thinking, but in order to think&quot;.

In 2018, he held a seminar for Year 11 and 12 philosophy students at Melbourne Grammar School, following an earlier visit during which he discussed &quot;Romulus, My Father&quot; with Year 9 students.

In May 2024 &quot;The Conversation&quot; published an essay based on the recent Jim Carlton Integrity Lecture delivered by Gaita at the Melbourne Law School, about the moral and philosophical elements pertaining to the Israeli-Palestine War.

==Awards and recognition==
=== Books ===
&quot;Romulus My Father&quot; won the Nettie Palmer Prize for Non-Fiction in the Victorian Premier&#x27;s Literary Award, and was shortlisted for the Queensland Premier&#x27;s Literary Awards for Contribution to Public Debate, the Braille Book of the Year, and the National Biography Award.

It was published by Text Publishing in its &quot;Text Classics&quot; series in 2017. 

After a lot of persistence on the part of Roxburgh, the story was made into a a feature film of the same name in 2007 by Richard Roxburgh. Robert Connolly and John Maynard produced the film, Eric Bana played Romulus, and Kodi Smit-McPhee, then aged nine, was selected to play the young Raimund – a role for which he won the AACTA Award for Best Young Actor.

&quot;A Common Humanity: Thinking about Love and Truth and Justice&quot; was nominated by &quot;The Economist&quot; as one of the best books of 2000.

== Personal life ==
Rai is married to Yael Gaita, and each of them have two daughters from prior marriages. One of his step-daughters is Michelle Lesh, and one of his daughters is Katerina. In 2004 Rai and Yael bought land in central Victoria, not far from where he lived as a child, and Raimund found that the move brought back memories of the pain he suffered as a child. Yael is Jewish and Israeli.

Gaita was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease in late 2021, but continues to live a life governed by his moral convictions. He has been on climate change rallies in Melbourne with Katerina, despite the discomfort of pouring rain, in an act of civil disobedience with Extinction Rebellion.

<text>Giuseppe Pierre Joseph Grisoni (&quot;bapt.&quot; 24 October 1699–1769), also known as Grifoni or Grison, was an Italian painter and sculptor, noted for his landscapes and historical tableaux.

==Biography==
Born in Mons, he studied in Florence under Tommaso Redi, abandoning his Flemish influences for the Italian tradition. In 1715 he travelled to London with John Talman and tried to establish himself as a portrait painter. He did not achieve enough success to stay, however, and returned to Florence in 1728 to teach at the Academy of Fine Arts. In 1740, he briefly relocated to Pisa before settling in Rome where he died.

One of his pupils was William Hoare (1707–1792).

<text>Hvalfjörður (, &quot;whale fjord&quot;) is situated in the west of Iceland between Mosfellsbær and Akranes. The fjord is approximately long and wide.

The origin of the name Hvalfjörður is uncertain. Certainly today there is no presence of whales in the fjord; while there is a whaling station in the fjord, whaling is conducted in the open ocean outside the fjord; likewise, it is modern and postdates the naming of the fjord. One theory as to the naming of the fjord is that early settlers encountered a pod of whales trapped in the fjord who ended up beached; the stranding of whales was in early Iceland a godsend in the meat that it provided, to the point that the word &quot;hvalreki&quot; means both &quot;whale beaching&quot; and &quot;windfall or godsend&quot;. However, there is no direct evidence to support this theory. Another theory is that the fjord is named after Hvalfjall (&quot;Whale Mountain&quot;, a mountain at the bottom of the fjord), which would have been in turn named after its visual appearance. A common folk story of unknown age also is sometimes presented as the origin of the name, involving an elf woman who transformed her human lover into an angry red-headed whale (&quot;Rauðhöfði&quot;), who subsequently lived in the fjord wrecking ships, as revenge for his refusal to acknowledge their child.

The only whaling station in Iceland is still located in this fjord. In the past the fjord also contained many herring fisheries.

During World War II, when Iceland was occupied by the Allies, a naval base of the British and American navies could be found in this fjord. The British base, HMS &quot;Baldur&quot;, was at Hvitanes, on a small point of land jutting into the fjord. The base was the headquarters of the Flag Officer Commanding, Iceland (C). One of the piers built by the United States Navy is today used by the Hvalur whaling company for the processing of fin whales, partially for the domestic market, and mostly for export to Japan.

Until the late 1990s, those travelling by car had to make a long detour of around the fjord on the hringvegur (road no. 1), in order to get from the city of Reykjavík to the town of Borgarnes. In 1998, the tunnel Hvalfjarðargöngin, which shortens the trip considerably, was opened to public traffic. The tunnel is approximately in length, and cuts travel by car around the fjord by about an hour. The tunnel runs to a depth of below sea level.

The south side of the fjord runs through the municipality of Kjós. Two different rivers named Fossá (Waterfall River) cross the road, each having a number of cascades, although the western one is easy to miss from the road, as its main fall tumbles from beneath the road into a lower forest. The sizeable Laxá (Salmon River) crosses the road near the heart of Kjós; south of it lies the lake Meðalfellsvatn, home to many summer houses. The large sandbar Hvalfjarðareyri is a popular place to see birds.

The innermost part of the fjord shows a mixture of volcanic mountains and green vegetation in summertime. At &quot;Botnsá&quot;, Nootka lupine is common, along with other flowers and moss, as well as small forests of birch and conifers. The area displays a good example of the planting of forests, a project that has been going on in Iceland for some years.

A hiking trail to the formerly-highest waterfall in Iceland, Glymur, has its origin at the innermost end of the fjord. The somewhat steep trail up the rim of the deep river gorge is called Leggjabrjótur, meaning &quot;Broken Leg&quot;. Before the ascent it passes through a short cave and across a thin improvised bridge. While it is possible to reach the bottom of the falls, it is not recommended; one has to wade through the cold river into the canyon, which is dim and at constant risk of falling rocks.

In the northwestern part of the fjord lies a tiny steep-sided island called Geirshólmi, which was for a time during the Age of the Sturlungs home to a band of outlaws led by Svarthöfði Dufgusson who regularly raided the farms on the mainland.

In the northwestern side of the fjord is Grundartangi, where a large aluminum smelter and silicon plant are located.

Hvalfjörður is also referenced in the novella &quot;The Odd Saga of the American and a Curious Icelandic Flock&quot;; as they pull to a stop at the toll before Hvalfjörður Tunnel, Alex begins to draw an important secret from an intoxicated Snorri.

<text>Zoe Karbonopsina, also Karvounopsina or Carbonopsina, (), was an empress and regent of the Byzantine Empire. She was the fourth spouse of the Byzantine Emperor Leo VI the Wise and the mother of Constantine VII, serving as his regent from 913 until 919.

==Early life==
Zoe Karbonopsina was born into a Greek family. She was a relative of the chronicler Theophanes the Confessor and a niece of the admiral Himerios.

==Empress==
Zoe was a mistress of Leo VI; they married on 9 January 906, after she had given birth to the future Constantine VII at the end of 905. Some have speculated that this marriage may have been influenced by Leo VI&#x27;s desire for a son, while others have suggested he may have been driven to marry due to religious feelings of guilt after he had made laws promoting marriage as an important institution. 

In any case, this was Leo VI&#x27;s fourth marriage and was therefore un-canonical in the eyes of the Eastern Orthodox Church, which had already been reluctant to accept his third marriage to Eudokia Baïana, who died in childbirth in 901.

Although the Patriarch Nicholas Mystikos reluctantly baptized Constantine, he forbade the emperor from marrying for the fourth time. Leo VI married Zoe with the assistance of a cooperative priest, Thomas, but Nicholas&#x27; continued opposition to the marriage led to his removal from office and replacement by Euthymios in 907. The new patriarch attempted a compromise by defrocking the offending priest but recognizing the marriage.

==Regency==
When Leo died in 912, he was succeeded by his younger brother Alexander, who recalled Nicholas Mystikos and expelled Zoe from the palace. Shortly before his death, Alexander provoked a war with Bulgaria. Zoe returned upon Alexander&#x27;s death in 913, but Nicholas forced her to enter the convent of St. Euphemia in Constantinople after obtaining the promise of the senate and the clergy not to accept her as empress. However, Nicholas&#x27; unpopular concessions to the Bulgarians later in the same year weakened his position and in 914 Zoe was able to overthrow Nicholas and replace him as regent. Nicholas was allowed to remain patriarch after reluctantly recognizing her as empress.

Zoe governed with the support of imperial bureaucrats and the influential general Leo Phokas the Elder, who was her favorite. Zoe&#x27;s first order of business was to revoke the concessions to Simeon I of Bulgaria, including the recognition of his imperial title and the arranged marriage between his daughter and Constantine VII. This renewed the war with Bulgaria, which began badly for the Byzantines who were distracted by military operations in Southern Italy and on the eastern frontier. In 915 Zoe&#x27;s troops defeated an Arab invasion of Armenia, and made peace with the Arabs. This freed her hands to organize a major expedition against the Bulgarians, who had raided deep into Byzantine Thrace and captured Adrianople. The campaign was planned on a grand scale and intended the bribing and transportation of Pechenegs into Bulgaria by the imperial fleet from the north.

However, the Pecheneg alliance failed, and Leo Phokas was crushingly defeated in the Battle of Anchialus and again at the Battle of Katasyrtai, both in 917. Zoe tried to ally with Serbia and the Magyars against Simeon. This also failed to produce any concrete results, and the Arabs, encouraged by the empire&#x27;s weakness, renewed their raids. A humiliating treaty with the Emirate of Sicily, who were asked to help subdue revolts in Italy, did little to improve the position of Zoe and her supporters.

==Later life==
In 919, there was a coup involving various factions, but the opposition to Zoe and Leo Phokas prevailed; in the end the admiral Romanos Lekapenos took power, married his daughter Helena Lekapene to Constantine VII, and forced Zoe back into the convent of Euphemia.
