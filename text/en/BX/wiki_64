<text>Jagiellonia Białystok () is a Polish professional football club based in Białystok that plays in the Ekstraklasa, the top level of Polish football. The club was founded in 1920 by soldiers in the 42nd Infantry Regiment Reserve Battalion in Białystok. Jagiellonia play their home games at the Chorten Arena.

Jagiellonia is the most accomplished football club of north-eastern Poland. The club won the Polish Cup and Super Cup in 2010 and qualified to play in the third round qualification of the UEFA Europa League, their first appearance in European tournaments. The club&#x27;s most successful season was the 2023–24 Ekstraklasa when they were crowned champions for the first time in the club&#x27;s history.

==History==

===The establishment of the club===
Jagiellonia Białystok was founded by soldiers in the Reserve Battalion of the 42nd Infantry Regiment on May 30, 1920. The team&#x27;s original name was shortened to &quot;KSBZ 42 PP&quot;. Their first game was against Kresowcy Białystok which they won 5–1. Later the team name was changed to &quot;WKS 42 PP&quot;, an abbreviation for &quot;Wojskowy Klub Sportowy&quot;, which means &quot;Army Sport Club&quot;. On November 2, 1930 WKS 42PP lost 1–2 against WKS 82 PP for the play-offs to advance to Division 1. January 27, 1932 was the first time &quot;Jagiellonia&quot; was introduced into the club&#x27;s name when it was changed to &quot;Białystok Sports Club Jagiellonia&quot;. The term &quot;Jagiellonia&quot; refers to the Jagiellonian dynasty which ruled Poland for two centuries. Around the same time, the club&#x27;s coat of arms was also introduced with its red and yellow colours. In 1938, due to financial problems, the club dissolved and ceased to exist until its reactivation in 1945. Unfortunately, in June the following year, with the new government in place there was no room for Jagiellonia, mostly because of the history with the Bolsheviks in 1920 and the 42nd Infantry Regiment. On January 26, 1957 the merging of Budowlani Białystok and Sparta Białystok reactivated Sports Club Jagiellonia Białystok with the original yellow-red-black crest restored.

===Club&#x27;s crest===

The club&#x27;s crest and colours first appeared in 1932. The original crest consisted of a black, stylized letter &quot;J&quot; and a yellow and cherry red colour shield, while the flag and the jerseys of the club were white and black. It was not until the mid-80s that fans began to use yellow-red as club colours, but official documents at the time still use the white and black colours. Currently, the team&#x27;s official colours are yellow-red, but in reference to history the team&#x27;s away colours are white and black.

===Jagiellonia before World War II===
In 1920–1923, most of the matches Jagiellonia played were either friendlies or small tournaments in Białystok. The club joined the regular league in 1924, starting in klasa B in the Vilnius OZPN district. The season was a success, winning the first season and gaining promotion to klasa A. Due to a pause in the league, there were no games in 1925. In 1926, the league started up again with the team being in klasa A. The team was doing well, finishing third in the following season. Later through the years the match officials were being paid off to make the Białystok team not do well and ultimately get demoted. In 1929, it was decided to change districts where Jagiellonia played to the newly formed Białystok OZPN. In 1930 42PP, the club&#x27;s name at the time, was the most successful thus far. They appeared in the play-offs for the top division in the country. At the end of the play-offs Jagiellonia and another team, WKS 82 pp Brześć, were tied for points and had to play one more game at a neutral ground to see who was the winner to that season. Jagiellonia fell to WKS 82 pp Brześć 2–1. Jagiellonia did win the district championship that season but it was the last trophy they won before World War II.

A big moment for the club was on January 27, 1932 when the WKS 42 PP football team and the KS Związku Młodzieży Wiejskiej athletics club merged to create a new multi-sports club called Białostocki Klub Sportowy (Białystok Sports Club) Jagiellonia. It is not known who created the team&#x27;s new crest but what is known is that it had to do with the history of the Jagiellonian dynasty, which ruled Poland between 1386 and 1572. Several more departments were founded, including volleyball, basketball, boxing. The most successful team sport section was the volleyball team, which qualified to the Polish Championships in 1933 and 1934, finishing 7th and 8th respectively.

===1930s===
In the mid-thirties Jagiellonia began to experience problems, the city was not able to maintain the club. In 1932, the military stationed in Białystok took an active role in trying to save the club, along with the municipal government in 1936 the club&#x27;s name changed to Military Sports Club Jagiellonia. Unfortunately, this decision did not solve the problem completely. In 1938, the club joined the A-class 1937/38 season but had to withdraw shortly after due to financial reasons. All the matches were cancelled and all the players were forced to find new clubs. Most of the players joined Strzelec Białystok and played there for two seasons before World War II broke out in 1939 and closed the first chapter in the history of the club.

===After World War II===
After the second world war Jagiellonia was revived mostly in part by Karol Kowalczyński, but the revival was short-lived as the club dissolved on 20 June 1946. In the place of the disbanded Jagiellonia came Motor Białystok, which became the champion of the Białystok region and advanced to the Polish championship in 1946. Next year Motor Białystok joined the struggle for the Polish championship and the right to get into I league. In 1949 Białystok had a new team called Budowlani Białystok and in 1951 Motor Białystok merged into Budowlani Białystok. In 1955 Budowlani Białystok changed its name to BKS Jagiellonia Białystok. On 26 January 1957, a merger of two clubs, Jagiellonia Białystok and Sparta, resulted in a club called Jagiellonia. For the second time in its history Jagiellonia had the host stadium of Stadium Zwierzyniecki.

===1970s===
In the early 70s the team played in Klasa A and in the district league. The team&#x27;s situation changed when Michał Urban became coach of the team, players started to go to a modern training camp with modern drills. Many young players started playing for the club, including future representatives for the Polish national team juniors. Grzegorz Bielatowicz joined the club as a scout and found a few young talents from the north-east region, among them was Jerzy Zawiślan who was the 2nd top scorer in the II League 1975–76 season who scored 13 goals. The team started to have some success and were promoted to Division II after winning the promotion play-offs in the 1974–75 season. The team was eventually promoted to League II in 1975, but the success was short-lived after only being there for 3 seasons, Jagiellonia was relegated in 1978. At the end of the 70s Jerzy Bołtuć, Leszek Frelek, Ryszard Karalus and Zbigniew Skoczylas began a large youth project to bring in a strong and young new team.

===1980s===
In the 1982–83 season, the club, led by Grzegorz Bielatowicz, had a successful run finishing first place with a nine-point advantage over second place, Gwardia Szczytno, promoting the team to Division II. With Olympic silver medalist Janusz Wójcik as coach, the team played a number of good seasons in Division II finishing third in 1986 and the following year was promoted to I Liga for the first time in the club&#x27;s history. In addition, the top scorer in the competition was a later representative of Poland, Jacek Bayer who netted 20 times for Jagiellonia.

Matches in the second league in Białystok were already averaging 15 thousand viewers. The first match in the return to Ekstraklasa had estimated 35-40 thousand supporters. Every home match following the first was viewed by no less than 20 thousand fans in the stands. Stories from witnesses said they recall buses of supporters come from villages all over the region. The first few seasons did not turn out well for the Białystok team as they finished 8th twice and then 16th, which meant they were relegated. A year later the team lost the playoffs for promotion in a penalty shoot-out against Zagłębie Sosnowiec. In the following year Jagiellonia finished 2nd place earning them promotion to the Ekstraklasa. After only one season in the first league the team was significantly outclassed and were relegated, where they continued to fall to the 4th league. They did not spend much time in the bottom tiers; within 3 years Jagiellonia was back in the second league.

=== 2000s and 2010s ===
In 2007, the team advanced to the first tier. The first season back the team finished 14th place with 27 points. The following year was better where the club finished 8th with 34 points. In 2009, the club was punished with a deduction of 10 points following a corruption scandal, committed by the previous president of the club. The first success of the club was the 2009–10 season where Jagiellonia won the Polish Cup, beating Pogoń Szczecin thanks to a goal from Andrius Skerla. The 2014–15 season was the second most successful season Jagiellonia saw finishing 3rd place. In the 2016–17 season Jagiellonia were runners up for the first time in the club&#x27;s history. Jagiellonia won the Polish Cup and finished 3rd and 2nd when coached by Michał Probierz.

Ireneusz Mamrot became the club&#x27;s new coach in June 2017. With Mamrots&#x27; guidance the club won the silver medal as runners up in a very tight race for the Polish championship, thus earning them a spot in the Europa League for the 2nd time in a row.

In the 2018–19 season, Jagiellonia Białystok drew an average home league attendance of 9,458. In January 2019, Rafał Grzyb, having the most caps for the club and long time captain became the club&#x27;s new assistant coach, officially retiring from playing football. On 23 August 2019, Jesús Imaz scored the first hat-trick in the club&#x27;s history in the Ekstraklasa.

=== 2024–: first championship and league phase of UEFA competitions ===
On 25 May 2024, Jagiellonia won the Ekstraklasa title for the first time in the club&#x27;s 104-year history, following a 3–0 win over Warta Poznań on the final day of the season.

In the 2024–25 European campaign, Jagiellonia Białystok started in the UEFA Champions League second qualifying round, defeating Panevėžys with an aggregate score of 7–1 (3–1 at home, 4–0 away). In the third qualifying round, they faced Bodø/Glimt and were eliminated with a 1–5 aggregate loss (0–1 at home, 1–4 away). This led Jagiellonia to the UEFA Europa League play-off round, where they played against Ajax but were defeated 1–7 on aggregate (1–4 at home, 0–3 away). Jagiellonia then entered the UEFA Conference League league phase, where they started with a 2–1 victory over Copenhagen.

==Ground==

Jagiellonia&#x27;s first formal stadium was constructed in 1971 and had 15,000 seats. Two years later the stadium&#x27;s capacity was doubled. It was originally named Hetman Białystok stadium or guards stadium. In 2006, the stadium was taken over by the city of Białystok and renamed Stadion Miejski (&quot;Municipal Stadium&quot;) which is where the club currently plays their home games. In 2008, a French-Polish construction company took on the task of renovating the stadium to become more modern. However, in 2012 due to delays the city terminated the contract with the company and hired a new company to finish the job. Spanish-Polish consortium company was hired to finish the job for a sum of PLN 254 million (US$75 million). The new 22,372 seat stadium was completed at the end of 2014.


==Club anthem==

The Polish version reads:

In English it is loosely translated to:

==Supporters==
The official representation of fans in contact with the club is the association of Children of Białystok. The main objective of the association is to unite all fans of Jagiellonia, in the stadium and in everyday life.

An important objective of Children of Białystok is to engage in sporting life, social and cultural, by organizing sporting events and entertainment for children, young people in schools, orphanages, educational centers, and helping people who are in need financially. Other important objectives of the association are:
*painting parts of the city of Białystok, and the Podlaskie voivodeship
*promote volunteering and to encourage voluntary blood drives
*promotion of physical culture, sports, tourism, and a healthy lifestyle
The creation of lighting and different choreography associated with the stadium is due in part by the Ultras Jagiellonia Białystok (UJB).

==Match-fixing scandal==
The questioning of Jagiellonia&#x27;s involvement in the corruption scandal that went through the Department of Discipline of the Polish Football Association started on 20 June 2008, when the National Prosecutor&#x27;s office in Wrocław handed over documents related to fixing 6 games in the II Liga during the 2004-05 season. On 26 June 2008, the Department of Discipline postponed the date that would decide the fate of the club. On 10 July, there was another extension to the discipline proceedings against the club so the Department of Discipline could get help from the Minister of Justice to obtain further documents from the National Prosecutor.

On 12 February 2009, Jagiellonia became the 10th club to be penalized for their involvement in the match-fixing scandal. The Department of Discipline of the PZPN imposed a penalty of relegation by one tier in the following season after the judgement became final of five accounts of sports crime. On March 24, 2009 the club launched an appeal against the decision. On 29 April 2009, the court repealed the punishment of relegation, instead handing the club a ten-point deduction for the following season and imposed a fine of 300 thousand złoty.

<doc id="677689" wikidata="Q143276" url="?curid=677689" title="Samurai Champloo">
<text>is a 2004 Japanese historical adventure anime television series. The debut television production of studio Manglobe, the 26-episode series aired from May 2004 to March 2005. It was first partially broadcast on Fuji TV, then had a complete airing on Fuji Network System. It was licensed for North American broadcast on Adult Swim, and for commercial release first by Geneon Entertainment and later by Crunchyroll. It was also licensed for English releases in the United Kingdom by MVM Films, and in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment. A manga adaptation was serialized in &quot;Monthly Shōnen Ace&quot; during 2004, later released in North America by Tokyopop the following year.

The series is set in a fictionalized version of Edo period Japan, blending traditional elements with anachronistic cultural references, including hip hop. The series follows the exploits of tea waitress Fuu, vagrant outlaw Mugen, and ronin Jin. Fuu saves Mugen and Jin from execution, then forces the pair to aid in her quest to find a samurai who smells of sunflowers. Structured similar to a road movie, the series focuses on tolerance and acceptance of minorities contrasted against its setting, with a central theme being the portrayal and acceptance of death.

Director Shinichirō Watanabe began planning for the series in 1999, creating the characters and premise during his work on &quot;Cowboy Bebop: The Movie&quot; and &quot;The Animatrix&quot;, and began pre-production in 2002. The staff included character designer and animation director Kazuto Nakazawa and writers Shinji Obara and Yukihiko Tsutsumi of Office Crescendo. The music was composed by hip hop artists Shinji &quot;Tsutchie&quot; Tsuchida of Shakkazombie, Fat Jon, Nujabes and Force of Nature. The production was unstructured, with the scenario going through multiple revisions, and Watanabe bringing in multiple guest creators to ensure a high animation quality. Reception of the series has been positive, with praise focusing on its animation and music, and proved a commercial success in the West.

== Plot ==

&quot;Samurai Champloo&quot; opens in a small town where Fuu, working as a tea waitress, is harassed by the son of the town&#x27;s corrupt prefect. The outlaw Mugen arrives in town, and Fuu begs him for protection, which he gives in exchange for food. Meanwhile, the ronin Jin, also a new arrival, kills the prefect&#x27;s bodyguards when they abuse a peasant, ending up in conflict with Mugen when the latter mistakes him for one of the prefect&#x27;s men. Mugen and Jin fight, destroying the tea house. The pair are captured and sentenced to death, but Fuu saves them. The pair attempt to restart their battle, but Fuu tosses a coin, saying if it lands on heads then the pair can continue their battle, but if it lands on tails they postpone their battle to help her find a samurai who smells of sunflowers, whom she has sought for years. She wins the toss, and they embark on a series of adventures alongside Fuu&#x27;s quest.

During the closing stories, the three finally arrive at the town of Ikitsuki, with each ending up in conflict with a group of assassins sent by the government to kill the &quot;sunflower samurai,&quot; Seizo Kasumi – Fuu’s father. Fuu finds Kasumi, seeking revenge for Kasumi abandoning Fuu and her mother, but she relents as he is already dying from an illness. One of the assassins kills Kasumi before he is defeated by Jin. Mugen and Jin then have their duel, their swords shattering, but choose not to kill each other as they now consider each other friends. Fuu learns her father played a part in the Shimabara Rebellion and went away to protect her. Fuu also reveals she lied about the coin toss result, which briefly annoys Mugen and Jin. Recovered from their final fight, the three part ways grateful for their shared adventure.

== Setting and themes ==
Series director Shinichirō Watanabe defined the central theme of &quot;Samurai Champloo&quot; as the portrayal and acceptance around death, themes he had previously explored in his science fiction series &quot;Macross Plus&quot; (1994) and &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; (1998). Another theme outlined in the series pitch was individuality and finding one&#x27;s unique identity. The series is set in Edo period Japan, roughly sixty years after the end of the Sengoku period. While a historical time period, the anime does not focus on historical detail beyond minor inclusions and references, mainly using contemporary-style dialogue and behavior. A conscious inclusion was emphasising cultural acceptance and tolerance of minorities including the indigenous Ainu people, foreigners, LGBT people, and Christians; the historical Edo period was a time when Japan was highly structured, conformist and isolationist. Due to its Edo setting and incorporation of samurai culture and honor codes, Watanabe was worried the anime would be seen as nationalistic in tone, prompting its focus on minorities and tolerance. Watanabe put in as much as he could manage of these themes and subjects, challenging earlier limitations imposed by a lack of historical information from the time and Japanese television codes restricting the portrayal of Japanese minorities in the period.

The main cultural influence on the anime is the music and associated subculture of hip hop. Watanabe had been a fan of hip hop music from his high school years, citing his first exposure as &quot;The Message&quot; by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. He compared the samurai culture to hip hop through a similar philosophy of self-identity. The use of hip hop also reinforced the series&#x27; focus on its minority and counter-cultural cast, creating a cultural reference by using one with the other. Alongside his liking of hip hop, Watanabe attributed a large amount of the series&#x27; inspiration in the works of actor Shintaro Katsu, particularly his historical dramas. The narrative approach of the finished series was inspired by Katsu&#x27;s notorious habit of directing projects without a set story structure. The word &quot;Champloo&quot; in the title was derived from the Okinawan term , with Watanabe comparing the blending of elements in the anime with the meaning of chanpurū. The food depicted in the show was originally accurate to the Edo period, but eventually expanded to include anachronistic dishes such as okonomiyaki.

The plot is structured like a road movie, with little connection between stories until the final three-part arc, contrasting against the serial structure of its contemporaries. Watanabe particularly cited the movies about the blind samurai Zatoichi as an inspiration for this style. Other influences on the series included &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; and &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;. One episode was based around the Chinese concept of Qi. During early planning, the series&#x27; tone was far more serious, but after the first four episodes had been written, the staff were worried about the tone becoming bleak, prompting a greater focus on comedy. Several episodes incorporate references, homages, and parodies of popular media. The Japanese episode titles use four-character idioms referencing the theme of that episode&#x27;s story. They drew from multiple sources, including Japanese and Western sayings (the first episode&#x27;s title, &quot;Shippu Doto&quot;, is a Japanese rendering of the German saying &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot;), philosophical concepts (&quot;Inga Oho&quot; references a proverb about the workings of karma), and pieces of classic media (the episode title &quot;Anya Koro&quot; references Naoya Shiga&#x27;s novel of the same name). The English episode titles were created by translator Ryan Morris. Morris did not directly translate the Japanese titles, instead using alliteration to preserve the rhythm and meaning.

=== Characters ===
The series follows the exploits of the three leads−Fuu, Mugen, and Jin−when they are drawn together by circumstance and end up traveling together to find the sunflower samurai. The main cast was created by Watanabe, who wanted a cast of heroes who were silly, immature, and dangerous, with &quot;a touch of insanity&quot;. He described Mugen and Jin as unconventional people not bound by the rules of the period. The characters were designed by Kazuto Nakazawa, who had worked as both an artist and director on multiple projects including &quot;Ashita no Nadja&quot; and the anime segments of &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 1&quot;. The early character drafts were more to Nakazawa&#x27;s tastes than the wishes of the production team, resulting in numerous redrafts based on requests. The voice recording included sessions with all three leads together, which caused occasional tensions due to their different work backgrounds.

* is a vagrant outlaw from the Ryukyu Islands who uses self-taught sword techniques. Having lived a harsh and solitary life since childhood, he has a deep mistrust and disdain of authority and lives to fight strong opponents. Watanabe thought of Mugen as young and &quot;a little stupid&quot;, putting him in stark contrast with &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; protagonist Spike Spiegel. He also described Mugen as symbolizing &quot;a rapper&#x27;s ideal&quot; of self-expression. Mugen&#x27;s Ryukyuen origins formed part of Watanabe&#x27;s focus on inclusivity and tolerance within the narrative. He is voiced in Japanese by Kazuya Nakai. His performance changed little from the audition, someone on the edge who did not follow rules. His performance reportedly improved during the soundchecks, which had a more relaxed atmosphere and emphasis on timing. In English, Mugen is voiced by Steve Blum.
* is Mugen&#x27;s antithesis, a calm and stoic ronin wandering Japan after being forced to kill his master and consequently wearing glasses to disguise himself. He is the best at sensing danger, and prone to risking his life to prove his worth. He is a master of , a style of created in the early Edo period by Harigaya Sekiun. Jin was created as a foil for Mugen to stop the story from becoming one-dimensional. A scrapped idea of Watanabe&#x27;s was for Jin to be an anarchist, but otherwise his personality and design changed little during production. He is voiced in Japanese by Ginpei Sato, at the time a stage actor who had not done voice roles previously after failing auditions for two other projects; his failed audition for &quot;Wolf&#x27;s Rain&quot; prompted a staff member to recommend him to Watanabe. He had to learn about voice acting on the job, including timing and getting into character, and during recording for later episodes got into trouble due to wanting to shift his portrayal of the character. In English, Jin is voiced by Kirk Thornton.
* is the one who brings Mugen and Jin together to help her. She is a cheerful and spirited young woman and a jack-of-all-trades due to her constant changing between part-time jobs, starting the series working as a tea waitress; she has a pet flying squirrel called Momo. A recurring gag is Fuu temporarily becoming fat after eating a lot. Out of the three characters, Fuu&#x27;s personality changed the least from Watanabe&#x27;s original series concept, though her character design underwent major revisions to become more conventionally beautiful. She is voiced in Japanese by Ayako Kawasumi. Compared to her other roles, Kawasumi was asked not to overact her effort sounds outside scenes where her character was very expressive, making her more realistic. It was the first time she did not create a separate internal character to voice Fuu, being asked to be herself as far as possible. Her favorite episode was &quot;Stranger Searching&quot; when the fat Fuu first appeared, as she found voicing this version a challenge. In English, Fuu is voiced by Kari Wahlgren.

In the original plan, there were three semi-regular characters that would appear through the series. They were Rekku, a Dutchman claiming to be Japanese; Koku, a traveling priest acquainted with Jin&#x27;s past; and Sara, a female ninja who falls in love with Mugen. While their roles were reduced to one-off appearances, versions of the characters survived. Rekku became the character Joji in &quot;Stranger Searching&quot;, the priest appeared in &quot;Lethal Lunacy&quot;, while Sara was a central character in &quot;Elegy of Entrapment&quot;. An early antagonist is Ryujiro, the son of a corrupt government official who loses his arm to Mugen in the opening episode and later plots revenge against them. Historical figures or character homages also appear, for example painter Hishikawa Moronobu; Joji, who is a fictionalized version of Isaac Titsingh; a version of American baseball player Alexander Cartwright; and Ando Uohori, who is a direct reference to Andy Warhol.

== Production ==

&quot;Samurai Champloo&quot; was the debut television production of animation studio Manglobe, which was started in 2002 by Sunrise veteran Shinichirō Kobayashi. The opening animation was contributed to by the studio Madhouse. A production committee to support the project was formed by Victor Entertainment&#x27;s Shirō Sasaki, partnering with Tokuma Shoten and North American company Geneon Entertainment. Watanabe acted as the series director, in addition to creating the project. Kobayashi, Sasaki, Sanae Mitsugi and Hideki Goto were credited as planners and executive producers, and the producers were Takatoshi Hamano, Takashi Kochiyama and Tetsuro Satomi.

The story was composed by Shinji Obara and Yukihiko Tsutsumi of Office Crescendo, with scripts written by Obara, Dai Satō, Touko Machida, Keiko Nobumoto, Seiko Takagi, Ryota Sugi, and Watanabe. Nakazawa wrote and storyboarded episode 15, being credited as Uwadan Shimofuwato in the former role. Nakazawa also acted as both character designer and chief animation director. The art director was Takeshi Waki, the storyboard director was Kazuki Akane, and coloring was led by Eri Suzuki. Additional characters were created by Hideto Komori. Weapon designs were co-created by Mahiro Maeda and Manglobe managing director Hidero Okamoto. The cinematographer was Kazuhiro Yamada, with Syuichi Kakesu as lead editor. Numerous guest creators were also brought in for different episodes as artists or animation directors, including Shūkō Murase Takeshi Yoshimoto, Naoko Nakamoto, Hiroyuki Imaishi and Tensai Okamura.

=== Concept and development ===
The concept for &quot;Samurai Champloo&quot; was created by Watanabe in 1999, then known for his work on &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;. He wanted to create a series antithetical to the largely calm and mature atmosphere of &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, wanting a complete change due to fatigue after working on one project for such a long period. The success of &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; meant he was permitted to develop whatever he wanted for his next project. As with his other projects, he drew inspiration from music, then matched a narrative to it. His approach was combining two of his favorite things, classic samurai adventure films and series and hip hop music, into a single work. He created the concept for &quot;Samurai Champloo&quot; during this period, but work on it was delayed due to his work on &quot;Cowboy Bebop: The Movie&quot; and his segments of &quot;The Animatrix&quot; at Studio 4°C. Kobayashi had invited Wanatabe to work on an original project at Manglobe when it was founded in February 2002, and Watanabe sent the &quot;Samurai Champloo&quot; pitch in May of that year. The pitch included the central concepts for the series, and draft designs for the lead characters. Watanabe invited Nakazawa on board as he was a fan of his work and wanted the opportunity to work with him. Obara, known more for his work on live-action movies and television dramas, was brought in through a mutual friend at Office Crescendo.

The eventual unstructured production style was unheard of in anime, and at the outset Obara created a series structure. The three-episode finale was not planned ahead, emerging naturally as part of the design approach. As the project evolved, Watanabe pushed for this structured approach to be discarded aside from the lead characters and premise, and Obara agreed to the new approach. The lack of a structure meant that the series narrative was constructed piece by piece, with few plot details being decided in advance. The fates of the three characters were also undecided during this stage. Watanabe originally planned for all three to survive, but at one point the team considered Jin and Mugen dying respectively in the final two episodes. Even the identity of the sunflower samurai was unknown to Watanabe during the early stages. Due to this approach, pre-production on the series lasted a year. Watanabe had a great deal of creative control and input, including on music selection and editing.

The first episode took a long time to polish, being completed around the beginning of 2004, but it and subsequent episodes had an animation quality higher than other series of the time. This was attributed to the working environment of Manglobe allowing for easy communication between staff members, and Watanabe&#x27;s passion for the project prompting famous staff from other notable anime projects to come on board. The non-standard style of production left some members of staff including Sasaki skeptical that the series would be finished. For the sound mixing, Watanabe wanted the same approach and quality as &quot;Cowboy Bebop: The Movie&quot;, bringing in sound engineer Masashi Yabuhara who had worked with Yoko Kanno on the sound design of &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;. The fight scenes were choreographed to appear more realistic than other period dramas, which featured a clashing of swords which in reality would chip them. Unique eyecatch artwork was created for each episode based on its themes and content. Woodblock prints portraying the characters, designed by former shojo manga creator Tsubaki Anna, were shown at various points through the series. Nakazawa created the illustration use for sponsor announcements.

=== Scenario and art design ===
&quot;Samurai Champloo&quot; was Obara&#x27;s first time working on an anime series, and Watanabe attributed him with bringing a new style of narrative and pacing to the series. Sato had worked with Watanabe before on &quot;Macross Plus&quot;. He described the process of discussing plot concepts with Watanabe and building upon voiced ideas, treating his own contributions like sample discs that might be accepted or rejected. The script meetings were unusually long, beginning with the synopsis and ending up with the final form, alongside off-topic conversation that was sometimes incorporated into that episode&#x27;s plot. Due to Watanabe&#x27;s reputation and the success of his projects in the West, the anime was created with a Western audience in mind with the expectation that it would be more successful outside Japan. This resulted in more overt references to Western culture being included. An assassin character who appeared in the second episode was intended to appear during the finale, but he was cut due to time constraints and a general lack of people remembering his earlier appearance.

Nakazawa had trouble getting a feel for the characters, with Mugen&#x27;s design still going through adjustments when production on the first episode began. For the animation of Mugen&#x27;s fighting style, the team used gymnastic footage as a reference alongside incorporating breakdancing moves. For Jin, Nakazawa &quot;ignored all of the conventions&quot; for sword fighting and kept his fighting style inconsistent throughout the series, basing his reactions and tactics on combat sports. He broke animation conventions to make these techniques work, confusing the animation team. For his work as art director after joining during production of the first episode, Waki was instructed to create extremes of light and darkness in scenes, creating a realistic impression of the period when artificial light sources were scarce and expensive. The variety and more contemporary elements prevented Waki from growing bored with the Edo setting. The approach to the animation, lacking an overarching plan, was described as a reflection of the lead characters&#x27; non-conformist personalities.

Nakazawa designed the men&#x27;s kimono to resemble contemporary jackets, incorporating homages to sports designs such as Adidas and Puma. Many secondary characters were designed based on both the series&#x27; voice actors and staff members. During the production of the second half of the series, it became increasingly difficult for Nakazawa to design all guest characters, resulting in Komori being brought in. Due to most of these characters being older men, when the early plan was for a young cast with several female characters, Komori felt disappointed by his workload. Maeda was brought on for weapon designs when the plan was to have strong antagonists with unique weapons for each episode, but the plan never came about, and when Maeda moved to working on &quot;&quot;, the design work shifted to Okamoto. The incorporation of graffiti was suggested by Sato to further enhance the hip hop aesthetic and tone. He also suggested the inclusion of references to Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat.

=== Music ===

The music for &quot;Samurai Champloo&quot; was collaboratively composed by Shinji &quot;Tsutchie&quot; Tsuchida of Shakkazombie, Fat Jon, Nujabes and Force of Nature. All were artists from the hip hop music genre, with Tsutchie being a friend of Watanabe. A number of guest artists contributed to different episodes. The opening theme &quot;Battlecry&quot; was composed by Nujabes, with Shing02 singing and writing the lyrics. The ending themes were created by Minmi, Kazami, and Azuma Riki. The final episode&#x27;s ending theme was &quot;San Francisco&quot;, licensed from the rapper band Midicronica.

&quot;The Music of Samurai Champloo&quot; was released across four CDs during 2004 by Victor Entertainment under their JVC label. The first two, &quot;Masta&quot; and &quot;Departure&quot;, were released on June 23. &quot;Departure&quot; focuses on tracks by Nujabes and Fat Jon alongside Minmi&#x27;s main ending theme, while &quot;Masta&quot; includes work from FORCE OF NATURE and Tsutchie including &quot;You&quot;. The next two, &quot;Playlist&quot; and &quot;Impression&quot;, were released on September 22. &quot;Playlist&quot; was dedicated entirely to work by Tsutchie, including &quot;Fly&quot;. &quot;Impression&quot; bundles tracks by Nujabes, Fat Jon and Force of Nature, alongside the theme &quot;Who&#x27;s Theme&quot;.

=== Broadcast ===
&quot;Samurai Champloo&quot; was first revealed through a magazine spread in the September 2003 issue of &quot;Newtype&quot;, and it premiered on Fuji TV on May 20, 2004. The series ran for seventeen episodes on the network until September 23, 2004, when they decided to cancel its broadcast. The series resumed airing on Fuji Network System, referred to as a second season, during the channel&#x27;s midnight slot; the remaining 18th–26th episodes aired from January 22 to March 19, 2005.

The original North American licensee was Geneon Entertainment and its parent company Pioneer Entertainment, licensing the anime a year before its Japanese broadcast. The dub was handled by Bang Zoom! Entertainment, with company president Eric Sherman remembering it as one of his favorite projects. In a later interview, Jin&#x27;s voice actor, Kirk Thornton, described the dubbing as a rare project where the actors were able to have a greater freedom in their performances, not having to match the Japanese original. It was broadcast in North America on Adult Swim during its late night slot, starting on May 14, 2005. Starting with Episode 22 on February 3, 2007, episodes were streamed through Adult Swim&#x27;s online Friday Night Fix channel. It saw subsequent North American broadcasts on Funimation Channel starting March 21, 2011; the series re-aired on Adult Swim through its Toonami programming block replacing &quot;Michiko &amp; Hatchin&quot; starting on January 2, 2016.

It formed part of a new anime-focused block alongside other series including &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; and &quot;Tokyo Ghoul&quot;. The series was added to the online library of Crunchyroll in 2016. Following Sony&#x27;s acquisition of Crunchyroll and merger with Funimation under the former&#x27;s brand, the series was fully moved to the Crunchyroll streaming platform.

A manga adaptation written by Masaru Gotsubo was serialized in Kadokawa Shoten&#x27;s &quot;Monthly Shōnen Ace&quot; from January 26, 2004, to September 25. Gotsubo decided not to follow the series narrative, calling that approach both boring and &quot;impossible&quot;. Instead, aside from the opening section, he created an original narrative using the central cast. The manga was collected in two volumes, released on July 28 and October 26, 2004. A compilation of the two volumes was released on January 28, 2011. It was licensed for a North American release by Tokyopop. The volumes were released on November 8, 2005, and March 7, 2006. The volumes were released in Australia on February 15 and March 15, 2006.

A companion book featuring artwork and interviews, &quot;Samurai Champloo Roman Album&quot;, was published by Tokuma Shoten on June 6, 2005, and reissued in May 2014. An English edition was published by Dark Horse Comics on February 21, 2007. A film comic adaptation of the opening episodes, intended to be the start of a series, was co-published in 2006 by Bandai Entertainment and Diamond Comics. American company Triad Toys licensed toy rights from Geneon in 2008, releasing figures of Mugen and Jin.

An action video game adaptation, &quot;Samurai Champloo: Sidetracked&quot;, was developed by Grasshopper Manufacture and published by Bandai Namco Games in Japan and North America in 2006. It tells a storyline separate from the series, described by the publisher as a &quot;lost episode&quot;. Company founder Goichi Suda acted as its director and writer, with Grasshopper&#x27;s mandate being to preserve the series&#x27; original tone and style. The music was composed by Masafumi Takada, inspired by the anime&#x27;s music. A social card battle game developed by Cybird was released in Japan on August 28, 2011, for mobile phones.

== Reception ==
The North American DVD release of &quot;Samurai Champloo&quot; was a commercial success. The final volumes were ranked by Nielsen VideoScan as among the top ten best-selling anime DVDs during mid-January 2006. On review aggregate website &quot;Rotten Tomatoes&quot;, the anime has a rating of 89% based on nine reviews. The Western home media releases saw positive responses for their visual and sound quality, though a lack of extras was noted.

Tasha Robinson, in a review of the first English DVD release for &quot;Sci-Fi Weekly&quot;, was concerned about the opening episode&#x27;s similarity to the set-up for &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;. In a similar review for &quot;Play Magazine&quot;, Dave Halverson noted his enjoyment of the story but felt readers should see the anime with as little story information as possible. &quot;DVDTalk&quot;″s Todd Douglass noted the simple premise of the story, but enjoyed each episode&#x27;s plot and praised the interactions of the main cast and its sense of style. Nick Browne of &quot;THEM Anime&quot; was less positive, faulting its weaker multi-episode stories and uneven treatment of serious cultural issues despite enjoying the humor born from its main cast. Salvan Bonaminio of &quot;The Escapist&quot; described the main cast as stereotypes, faulted the forgettable supporting cast, and called many episodes including the ending underwhelming. James Beckett of &quot;Anime News Network&quot; enjoyed the main cast, but negatively cited a lack of cohesion across the series, and strongly criticised Fuu&#x27;s frequent kidnappings for story purposes as detrimental to her character.

Halverson gave praise to the animation and character designs without specific commentary, while Robinson positively compared the fight choreography and art design to Watanabe&#x27;s work on &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; and &quot;The Animatrix&quot;. Douglass cited the anime as a perfect example of Watanabe&#x27;s visual style, and Browne cited its visuals and technical achievements as high points. Bonaminio included a positive mention of the anime&#x27;s visible production quality during his summary. Becket felt the animation style had aged poorly, though giving praise to the art style and fight sequences. The music met with general praise for its use and style. Becket additionally praised the English dub.

The mixture of traditional elements with hip hop met with some mixed responses. Halverson was enthusiastic about them and called the hip hop representation superior to many Western portrayals. Robinson also enjoyed them, noting that they kept the anime from being too much like &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;. Browne enjoyed the contemporary visual references used alongside the Edo setting, but faulted the show&#x27;s reliance on them. By contrast, Bonaminio cited its sense of style and unique blend of elements its greatest strength.

As part of a 2007 retrospective article on Geneon Entertainment, David Smith of &quot;IGN&quot; called it one of the best anime published by the company during its lifetime, saying it was almost perfect in what it did and stood out from other Geneon properties. Mike Dent of &quot;Otaku USA Magazine&quot;, writing in 2015, praised the music for adding to each episode&#x27;s atmosphere, in addition to its animation quality and writing. In a 2019 retrospective for &quot;Anime News Network&quot;, Matthew Roe states &quot;the mixture of hip-hop aesthetics and classic samurai tropes seems like a more awkward fit than &quot;Bebop&quot;″s effortless fusion of jazz and science fiction&quot; and further criticized a lack of emotional resonance, but felt the direction of Watanabe and Manglobe kept the series going. Reuben Baron of &quot;The Verge&quot;, writing in a 2021 article on Watanabe&#x27;s work, called &quot;Samurai Champloo&quot; the director&#x27;s second most popular work after &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, citing its humor and themes as positives. The ambient soundtrack was ranked by &quot;IGN&quot; as tenth among their Top Ten Anime Themes and Soundtracks of All Time.

<text>TS Podbeskidzie Bielsko-Biała () is a football club based in Bielsko-Biała, Poland. They compete in II liga in the 2024–25 season, after being relegated from the 2023–24 I liga.

== History ==

The club was essentially founded on 11 July 1997, although it can trace its roots back to 1907. That year &quot;Bielitzer Fussball Klub&quot; (&quot;FK Bielitz&quot;) was established, in the town of Bielitz, Austria-Hungary, then dominated by ethnic Germans and so was the club. In 1911, the club was renamed to &quot;Bielitz-Bialaer Sport Verein&quot; (&quot;BBSV&quot;). Since 1920, the town, known henceforth as Bielsko, belonged to Poland, after the country regained independence. In 1936, the club changed its German name to Polish &quot;Bielsko-Bialskie Towarzystwo Sportowe Bielsko&quot; (&quot;BBTS Bielsko&quot;). In 1968, it was merged with &quot;KS Włókniarz&quot; (founded in 1911). The third &quot;ancestor&quot;, &quot;DKS Komorowice&quot;, was founded in 1995. Said clubs were merged altogether in 1997 to form &quot;TS Podbeskidzie Bielsko-Biała&quot;. From 2011 to 2016 the club performed in the top Polish football league, the Ekstraklasa, promoted as the first club from the city, before being relegated to the I liga.

They competed in the Ekstraklasa again, following their 2019–20 promotion. After the season they were relegated back to the second-tier I liga. Despite the club&#x27;s ambitions to quickly bounce back, they finished the 2023–24 I liga season second-last. This marked the end of their twenty-two-year run of competing across the top two divisions of Polish football, and a return to the third-tier for the first time since the 2001–02 season.

<text>Gliwicki Klub Sportowy Piast Gliwice () is a Polish professional football club based in Gliwice. In the 2018–19 season, Piast won its first Polish championship. As of 2024–25, it competes in the Ekstraklasa, Poland&#x27;s top division.

==History==

The club was founded in June 1945 by the Poles who had been forced to leave their homes in former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union (present-day Ukraine). The club&#x27;s name comes from the Piast dynasty, which ruled Poland from its beginnings as an independent state in the 10th century, until 1370, and in the city itself until 1532.

In 1949, five local teams were merged with Piast, and the team was renamed to Metal Piast Gliwice, and then to Stal Gliwice, before its original name Piast Gliwice was restored in 1955. Piast continued to play their matches on ul. Robotniczej. In 1964, Piast merged with GKS Gliwice, a team formed in 1956 from a fusion of the three other local clubs, and the name was changed to GKS Piast Gliwice. Since the 1950s, Piast mostly played in the Second Division. During that period, Piast have twice (1978, 1983) managed to reach the final of the Polish Cup, losing on both occasions.

In the 1990s, due to financial difficulties, the team was rebuilt from the Klasa B (7th tier), achieving four consecutive promotions from the seventh to the third tier in 1997–2001, and afterwards it won promotion to the II liga (second tier) in 2003. Piast played as many as 33 seasons in the Polish Second Division, before finally being promoted to the Ekstraklasa in 2008. Having played two seasons in the top division, the club was relegated in 2010 to come back in 2012. It is the first football team in Poland to gain promotion from the 7th tier to the Ekstraklasa (Polish top tier of football) and later to the European club competition.

In the 2010s, Piast enjoyed its greatest success, being runners-up in the 2015–16 Ekstraklasa and winning its first Polish championship in the 2018–19 season.

There is also a futsal department of Piast Gliwice, which competes in the Futsal Ekstraklasa (top division). Its home venue is the Gliwice Arena. It won its first Polish Championship in the 2021–22 season.

<text>Morski Związkowy Klub Sportowy Arka Gdynia () is a professional football club based in Gdynia, Poland, that plays in the Polish I liga. The club was founded as Klub Sportowy Gdynia in 1929.
== History ==
The history of Arka dates back to 1929, when a group of workers of the Port of Gdynia founded &quot;Klub Sportowy (Sports Club) Gdynia&quot; (abbreviated KS Gdynia). In 1932, a new stadium of KS was opened at &quot;Polanka Redłowska&quot;. This location was used by the club until 2000. In 1934, &quot;Klub Sportowy Kotwica&quot; (Sports Club Anchor) was registered. Both team existed until 1939.

In 1949, &quot;Rybacki Klub Sportowy (&quot;Fishermen Sports Club&quot;) MIR&quot; was formed. Three years later, its name was changed to &quot;Klub Sportowy Kolejarz-Arka Gdynia&quot;. In 1953, the team for the first time won promotion to the third level of Polish football. In 1959, Arka&#x27;s U-19 became Polish runner-up, and in 1960, after a dramatic game vs. Hutnik Kraków, Arka won promotion to the Second Division.

In 1964, Arka merged with Doker Gdynia, to form Morski Związkowy Klub Sportowy (MZKS; &quot;Maritime United Sports Club&quot;) Gdynia. In 1972, its name was changed into Arka. Two years later Arka won promotion to the Ekstraklasa. Relegated after one year, Arka returned to the top level in 1976. In 1979 Arka, managed by Czesław Boguszewicz, became the first team from Polish Baltic Sea coast to win the Polish Cup. In the final game, which took place in Lublin, Arka beat Wisła Kraków 2–1. In its UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup debut, Arka lost to Bulgarian side PFC Beroe Stara Zagora (3–2, 0–2).

In 1982, Arka was relegated from the top level, to return there in 2005. In the 1982 World Cup in Spain, Arka&#x27;s Janusz Kupcewicz was among top players of Polish national team, which won bronze medal.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Arka played either in the third or second division, with a number of promotions and relegations. In 2001, after six years in the third level, Arka again won promotion to the second division, and in 2005, the team returned to Ekstraklasa.

In 2011, the City of Gdynia completed the construction of a new stadium, located on Olimpijska Street. On 19 February 2011, Arka tied 1–1 with Beroe Stara Zagora in a friendly game to commemorate the opening of their new venue. That year, Arka were relegated from the top level.

In 2016, Arka was promoted to the top level again after taking first place in the I Liga. Soon after getting promoted, Arka won the Polish Cup for the second time, and the Polish Super Cup twice: in 2017 and 2018.

==Fans==

Arka is one of the most supported clubs in Poland, drawing in support from mostly across Pomerania. Outside the Tricity, Arka has fan-clubs in all major cities and towns in the region, such as Tczew, Wejherowo, Braniewo and Kościerzyna for example, as well as fan-clubs in places further away such as Zakopane and Lublin Voivodeship, and even two fan-clubs in Germany set up by expatriate Arka fans, in Oberhausen and Stuttgart.

The fans have an alliance with fans of Cracovia and Lech Poznań, and the three are known as &quot;The Great Triad&quot; (&quot;Wielka Triada&quot;). Fans of Lechia Gdańsk, Śląsk Wrocław and Wisła Kraków also share a friendship called &quot;The Three Kings of Great Cities&quot; (&quot;Trzej Królowie Wielkich Miast&quot;) and any match between the two alliances is a considered a big rivalry.

Arka fans maintain alliances with several other fans aside from Cracovia and Lech, many of them lasting now for decades: fans of Górnik Wałbrzych (since 1983), Zagłębie Lubin (since 1983), Gwardia Koszalin (since 1989), and KSZO Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski (since 2004) are all considered good friends. The friendship with Polonia Bytom fans dates back to 1974, and is one of the longest friendships in supporter history which has survived to date.

The greatest rival or Arka is Lechia Gdańsk, a team with whom they contest the so-called Tricity Derby or Pomeranian Derby. Fans of both teams remain venomously hostile and since the early 1970s the history of games between Arka and Lechia is marked by riots and violence. Relations with another Gdynia football team Bałtyk Gdynia used to be friendly until the 1980s, when they turned hostile. Due to Bałtyk&#x27;s successive relegations and their declining numbers of fans this rivalry is now of lesser importance.

<text>Klub Sportowy Górnik Konin is a Polish football club based in Konin, Poland. They currently play in the V liga. 

Its biggest successes came under the unpopular Klub Sportowy Aluminium Konin name in the 1997–98 season, when they finished runners-up in the second division and very controversially lost the Polish Cup final that year to Amica Wronki. Despite this success, the club has had a long history of financial mismanagement and turbulent ownership stemming from that era, as a result of which the club has struggled to recover from ever since.

==History==
===Beginnings and rise===
Football in Konin can be traced back to the early 20th century. The current club&#x27;s predecessors have been active since 1945, after many mergers till 1954 when the &quot;Koło Sportowe Górnik&quot; was founded, which 3 years later, in 1957 became today&#x27;s &quot;Klub Sportowy Górnik Konin&quot;, its registration is officially recognised as its founding date. The club spent the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s oscillating between the voivodeship-level leagues and the third tier of Polish football. In the 1991–92 season, Górnik finally gained the long-awaited promotion to the second division for the first time, despite coming close several times before.

===Name change and the 1998 Cup Final===
In 1996–97, the main sponsor of the club, the local coal mine &quot;Konin&quot; withdrew its funding, and the club was transferred under the wing of the local aluminium foundry. The new owners however made the very unpopular decision to change the club name to Aluminium Konin, despite many fan-protests. The following 1997–98 season was the most successful in its history, however considering the amount of funding the club received and the fact that its ultimate aim was promotion to the top tier, the season was still classed as disappointing.

Even reaching the Polish Cup final did little to please fans, as despite Aluminium being by far the better team, Amica Wronki won in controversial circumstances, with many officiating mistakes made by the referee Marek Kowalczyk. Aluminium players initially refused to start the second half. Impartial observers, such the manager of Lech Poznań Adam Topolski, chairman of Olimpia Poznań (a top flight club at the time) Bolesław Krzyżostaniak, the chief of Zawisza Bydgoszcz Edward Potok and former Górnik Konin manager Janusz Białek were all highly critical of the match they have witnessed. Over 7000 Górnik fans were present at Bułgarska Street Stadium in Poznań, additionally supported by local Lech Poznań fans. Despite the PZPN match observer Alojzy Jarguz inexplicably giving the referee a high note for his performance, Kowalczyk was later given a 3-month ban.

In the aftermath of the match, Ryszard F., known as &quot;Fryzjer&quot;, the leader of an organised crime group involved in fixing matches all around the country, was the director of Amica Wronki at the time. He later admitted to fixing the match in his autobiography. The 1998 cup final however was never investigated, with trophy still belonging to the now defunct Amica Wronki team, and remains a sore point for Górnik fans to this day.

===Mismanagement &amp; scandals===

The following 1998–99 season was greeted with financial troubles, after the privatisation of the aluminium foundry meant that it was taken over by the company &quot;Impexmetal SA&quot;, who withdrew their support for the club. Despite issues, they still finished the first half of the season in first place. The owners of the club, the aluminium works, also created a complicated structure whereby there was one club, but the reserve teams and junior sides played under a different name, resulting in one club, two boards, and two names, and made each section a separate legal entity. Piotr Nowak became the chairman of the club, but the then manager Jerzy Kasalik was surprisingly sacked for an unexplained reason, despite their first place in the league, and appointed a little-known manager Jarosław Kotas. The team soon started to lose matches at an alarming rate and only just managed to escape relegation, only thanks to their good start.

The 1999–2000 campaign proved to be a disaster. The owners decided to rename the senior team &quot;KP Konin&quot;, whilst the reserve and junior teams used the old &quot;Aluminium Konin&quot; name. The club finished dead last after abysmal performances. It then turned out that in the second half of the season plans to relocate the team to Bydgoszcz were put in place, but still to play under the name &quot;KP Konin&quot;. In the end, the relocation never came to fruition, but the team which only amassed 8 points the entire season, was disbanded, with the club management and the chairman Piotr Nowak, who played professional football in the USA on a daily basis at the time, widely held responsible. The reserve team, which that same season was relegated from the third division, became the first team, and a season later (2000–01 season) managed to gain promotion, going straight back up.

Under the lead of Jerzy Kasalik, the team achieved a back-to-back promotion to the second division, restoring the club&#x27;s place after the first team was disbanded. The success however was short-lived, after in the 2003–04 season the club finished last once again. Following their relegation, many of the Aluminium players were involved in the large corruption scandal in Polish football which shook the country that season, which had a major impact on the club sponsors who all withdrew. This meant that the new club couldn&#x27;t even afford to play in the then regional III liga, and the senior team was disbanded.

===New start===
The only team left was the Aluminium junior team, which played in the local A-klasa, the sixth tier of Polish football. The ambitious team won promotion in the 2005. In the 2006–07 season, the restructuring of the league by the Polish FA meant that despite winning the fourth division, the club would need a play-off against GKS Tychy to gain promotion, which they lost. In April 2008, a new sponsor was found, white goods and consumer electronics retail chain &quot;Avans&quot;, and after 12 years of waiting to drop the very unpopular &quot;Aluminium&quot; name, the club finally reverted to its historical name &quot;Górnik&quot;, initially at first with the one season-long sponsor name in the form of &quot;KS Avans Górnik Konin&quot;. The club was still burdened with debts and various managerial problems which were left after the &quot;Aluminium&quot; era.

Górnik organised fan movement started in the late 1980s, and took off in the 90&#x27;s, however the club was always very popular among locals. The club has had a constant number of loyal supporters regardless of the division the team happened to be in (which varied from local amateur division to nationwide leagues). Their nickname is &quot;Łańcuchy&quot; (The Chains).

Their number one enemy has always been fans of KKS Kalisz. Other strong rivalries have been with Legia Chełmża, with an infamous riots between the two hitting major headlines in 2010, and with Amica Wronki (now re-founded as Błękitni Wronki) due to the 1998 Polish Cup final shrouded in scandal, although due to vast gap in the league pyramid there has not been many matches with the latter.

Like many teams in the Greater Poland region, at first Górnik fans were also fans of the local powerhouse Lech Poznań, and it was Lech fans which were the inspiration and precursors of the fan movement in Konin. Although presently the two sets of fans have no connection with each other, many Górnik fans still sympathise with Lech. The fans used to have friendly relations in the 90&#x27;s with fans of Górnik Wałbrzych. Fans of Ostrovia Ostrów Wielkopolski are also warmly welcomed, as like Górnik, also sympathise with Lech and have a strong rivalry with KKS Kalisz. Presently the fans have friendly relations with fans of Gwardia Koszalin, officially since 18 April 2009.

<doc id="677723" wikidata="Q7627675" url="?curid=677723" title="Student Environmental Action Coalition">
<text>The Student Environmental Action Coalition (SEAC) was a student-run, student-led US national environmental group that originated in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. In the beginning it focused primarily on conserving, protecting, and restoring the natural environment, but later its member student environmental organizations took on a broader definition of the environment that includes racism, sexism, militarism, heterosexism, economic justice, and animal rights.

By challenging the power structure that threatens these conditions, SEAC worked to create progressive social and environmental change on both the local and global level. It took a hard-line stance on the issues it addressed. It went through several different stages of organization, and ended up as a bottom-up organization so that the headquarters took its direction from the individual chapters around the country. The national organization was wound up in 2014, but dozens of campus environmental groups still bear its name.

== History and past accomplishments ==
In 1988, students placed an ad in Greenpeace magazine about networking with other young environmentalists. Later, their first action was a letter writing campaign to support a Global Warming Protection Act. In early 1989, they set about organizing a national student environmental conference with the aim of launching a new, united, national student environmental movement in the United States. Called Threshold, this historic conference on the weekend of October 27–29, 1989, was a success, attracting more than 1,700 students from 225 universities and schools from 43 states and several countries. The conference effectively brought the organization to life, and its participants voted to make SEAC&#x27;s first national campaign saving old-growth forest and reforming the U.S. Forest Service. The next time SEAC members met in Champaign, Illinois, a year later, they were 7,000 strong from every U.S. state, plus others from 11 countries.

At a summer 1991 meeting of the SEAC National Council, the group agreed on 2 major new projects: another national conference (called Common Ground, held in Boulder Colorado), and an international effort to influence outcome of the Earth Summit being held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992. The Council also approved a field-organizing program.

The work on the Rio Summit was conducted under the banner Action for Solidarity, Equality, Environment and Development (A SEED), and involved youth organizations from around the world. A SEED grew into SEAC’s largest project, including a speaker’s tour, educational events, and coordinated conferences in three states and 23 countries over a single weekend and connected together by email and fax. In March 1992, SEAC organized demonstrations at the United Nations and by June, a SEAC member had been added as an official observer on the US delegation to the Summit. SEAC became the North American arm of the ASEED network, which operated in 62 countries.

At its peak SEAC employed 13 full-time staff in 1991, split between the national office, work on A SEED, and field organizing. In 1992, SEAC’s staff was cut to five amidst a loss of funding. 1992 also witnessed changes in the governance of the group as the National Council meeting agreed to the demand from a SEAC People of Color Caucus (POCC) to give the POCC equal representation on the Council. In 1993, SEAC campaigned on fighting the North America Free Trade Agreement and held its first summer Training Program. It also joined the Free Burma Campaign. In 1994, SEAC started a project, proposed by the POCC, called the Environmental Justice Initiative (EJI). The EJI sought to educate and empowering youth and high school students, and part of this initiative evolved into Youth United for Community Action, which became its own organization in 1996.

In the summer of 1996, SEAC&#x27;s Coordinating Committee decided to cut a program that held activist training sessions at different schools in order to save money, but this precipitated a loss of philanthropic funding. Amid an internal struggle of staff, leadership and members, ultimately all the national staff quit and the national office closed. Meanwhile regional and local organizing continued, though the emergence of large and well-funded student networks as offshoots of mainstream national environmental organizations such as Sierra Student Coalition and student PIRGs, undermined SEAC&#x27;s position at the center of student environmental activism. In 1997 volunteers reopened a much scaled down national office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Some of the accomplishments of SEAC chapters include:

&quot;January 1991&quot;- As SEACers protested the war in Iraq and at the same time launched the Energy Independence Campaign.

&quot;1992&quot; - The New York chapter brought together 120 schools to protest the Hydro-Québec II dam in Canada. This dam would have flooded an area 1000 kilometers and damaged land of the indigenous Cree tribe. SEAC and the Cree challenged the two billion dollar Rupert River hydroelectric project again in 2005. Originally, the Cree had agreed on payment for this over 50 years summing $70 million at the hand of Grand Chieft Ted Moses. However, Matthew Mukash is the person now challenging it. In August 2005, “federal and provincial environmental review panels said Hydro-Québec&#x27;s impact study was deeply flawed and sent the provincial utility back to the drawing board.”

&quot;1994&quot; - Pitt &amp; Michigan State removed themselves from the Mt. Graham Telescope project in Arizona which was endangering red squirrel habitat and sacred Apache land. Judge Alfredo Marquez oversaw the case in court stated the &quot;risks of irreparable injury to the endangered red squirrels which live on the site&quot; violated the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act.

At a University of Wisconsin, Madison Greens, Madison’s own annual Earth Day was created. Frances Moore Lappe (social change activist and one of Earth Days founders), Dana Lyons (environmentalist), and Road Rage (anti-GMO road show) visited the celebration. Part of the event was also a protest against the Agracetus Campus, a subsidiary Monsanto known for its genetically engineered Roundup as well as transgenic corn, cotton and soy. Roundup, a pesticide applied to crops, has glyphosates, which had varying results regarding carcinogenicity.

&quot;Miami Dade, Florida&quot; - A Student Organization for Animal Rights from the Miami-Dade Community College successfully pushed a bill through its General Assembly regarding the situation of factory-farmed pigs. This was a first nationwide.

&quot;Late 2002&quot; – Berea, Kentucky – a joint effort observed a leap forward when the Pentagon released information stating “neutralization and supercritical water oxidation -- not incineration -- is its preferred recommended technology for destruction of chemical weapons stored at the Blue Grass Army Depot.”

&quot;November 2002&quot; - After a two-year campaign, SEAC successfully convinced office supply company Staples to stop offering products that came from endangered forests and start offering recycled paper products.

&quot;Shepherdstown, West Virginia&quot; - A student won an election on the town council which was “a huge role in fighting gentrification as well as signing the town onto the US Mayors&#x27; Climate Protection Agreement”

&quot;“No Coal Days of Action”&quot; exposed Citibank and Bank of America’s support of destructive coal companies when SEACers performed a “die-in” and effectively shut down the Citibank branch in Washington, D.C.

&quot;March 2007&quot; - Students protested mountaintop coal removal at “Mountain Justice Spring Break”, West Virginia.

&quot;October 2007&quot; – “No War No Warming,” a war and global warming protest congregated at Capitol Hill on Independence Avenue.

== SEAC’s principles ==

SEAC has published 14 organizational principles:

# Fight environmental degradation
# Recognize the impact of the environment on human individuals and communities.
# Support human rights.
# Support animal rights.
# Demand corporate responsibility.
# Fight class inequalities.
# Fight racism.
# Fight sexism.
# Fight homophobia and heterosexism.
# Fight imperialism and militarism.
# Have a diverse membership.
# Develop an activist rather than a volunteer approach.
# Link our issues to local, community concerns.
# SEAC National exists to empower the grassroots through training and education. We view national campaigns as one of the tools to accomplish these goals.

== Last projects ==

At the end of its life, SEAC had one national campaign, Campus Climate Challenge, and three initiatives: Tampaction, Militarism and the Environment, and Mountain Justice.

The Campus Climate Challenge
SEAC was one of 30 organizations from the United States and Canada that was a part of Campus Climate Challenge, their primary campaign. Climatechallenge.org is a partner in fighting global warming.

Tampaction
Those participating in Tampaction believe that tampons and menstrual pads oppress people who menstruate. The products themselves are thought to be detrimental to the environment. The companies that make the products are suspected of dumping toxins into the ecosystem. Participants of Tampaction want to embrace their body and all that that implies and return to a more natural mindset, like herbal for example.

Militarism and the Environment
 SEAC also fought military conflicts since in military conflicts bombs are dropped and/or dangerous chemicals are used, such as in napalm and chemical weapons. SEAC believed no war can be considered good. “No War No Warming” was an active project due to this concern. SEAC aimed for complete nuclear disarmament and a complete dismantling of nuclear arsenals.

Mountain Justice Spring Break
 Mountain Justice Spring Break was an ongoing project supported by SEAC. Mountaintop mining economically benefits very few (including employment), and has disproportionally far-reaching environmental impacts, including soil erosion and flooding. When the mountaintop removal blasts ignite, dust particulates of materials in the soil become airborne and are having a negative impact on human health. In addition, when the blast site is too close to residential areas, the structural stability of the residential buildings is adversely affected.

<text>The Focolare Movement is an international organisation of spiritual and social renewal and Christian new religious movement that promotes the ideals of unity and universal brother/sisterhood grounded in the Golden Rule. It was founded by then elementary school teacher Chiara Lubich in 1943 in Trento, Northern Italy, as a Roman Catholic lay movement; it remains largely Roman Catholic but has strong links and member of many major Christian denominations, other religions and non-religious people.

The Focolare Movement is present in more than 180 nations, has over 140,440 members and more than 4 million sympathisers. The word &quot;Focolare&quot; is Italian for &quot;family fireside&quot;.

While the term Focolare is the common sobriquet of the international organization, the International Association of the Faithful of Pontifical Right lists its official name as &quot;Work of Mary&quot;, approved in 1990 as &quot;Opus Mariae&quot;.

== Beginnings ==
In the Northern Italian city of Trento in 1943, in the climate of violence and hatred of the Second World War and Nazi Occupation of Northern Italy (under the puppet state known as Republic of Salò), the young elementary school teacher Chiara Lubich saw God&#x27;s Love as the only thing that was not fallen in rubble. With a copy of the Gospel from her spiritual father, she and few girls, while sheltering during air raids, started to live each phrase for the day or for the week. Of the many phrases lived she claimed two struck her deeply: Jesus&#x27; prayer &quot;that they all may be one&quot; and Jesus&#x27; outcry &quot;My God, why have you forsaken me?&quot; Later she will call these &quot;the two faces of the medal that forms the movement&quot;.

During the war this group of young girls and many others sequentially joined in helping those in the shelters and in the poorest parts of the town of Trento, sharing her vision that was later called &quot;Ideal&quot;.

In the aftermath of the Second World War criticisms, misunderstandings and accusations began to spread against this new community in Trento. Living the Gospel, communicating experiences, sharing their few possessions and making unity their ideal, aroused suspicions of Protestantism or a new form of communism. Their radical way of living the Gospel that Chiara proposed attracted the accusation of &quot;fanaticism&quot;, and the word &quot;love&quot;, not customarily used in the Catholic sphere at that time, was likewise misunderstood.

In 1948, the Italian politician and journalist Igino Giordani, an Italian Republic Constitution father, member of the Italian Parliament and pioneer of ecumenism joined the group, bringing social unity and politics as new dimensions of the ideal. Giordani is one of the co-founders, along with Fr. Pasquale Foresi, who would work on the theological ground to answer the Catholic Church questions and later help found the movement main journal, New City Press, in 1964.

The movement, even under adversities between 1949–50, spread rapidly throughout Northern Italy and across Europe, then worldwide. In 1958, members of the movement from Europe began to travel to other continents at the request of people who wanted to know more about it. In 1958, it reached various countries in South America, in 1961 North America, in 1963 Africa, in 1966 Asia and 1967 Australia.

Today it has 140,440 members in more than 180 countries. People more broadly involved in the movement are estimated by the Vatican at 4.5 million.

== Focolare towns ==

After 1949, summer vacations together in Fiera di Primiero in the Dolomite Mountains and many other places in Norther Italy saw large numbers incoming for the retreats. Some priests and religious with a variety of spiritualities were present even if the movement was not yet fully recognised by many churches, and by 1955 this gathering took on the name &quot;Mariapolis&quot;, literally &quot;City of Mary&quot; since it was a place &quot;to live like Mary&quot;.

The desire to share, materially, culturally, and spiritually, beyond the sole summer reached a focal point after Chiara&#x27;s visit to the Benedictine Einsiedeln Abbey in Switzerland in 1962. The dream of permanent towns of brother/sisterhood, &quot;simple houses, workplaces, schools—just like an ordinary town&quot; began to take the first steps, and in 1964 Loppiano, the first permanent Mariapolis was built on land donated by Vincenzo Folonari, near Florence. It has grown to include 900 people of worldwide origins and diverse occupations, married and single, priests and religious, who work and study together and strive to live the ideal.

According to the data published by the Focolare Movement, twenty-four other such towns have sprung up worldwide. Some have specific emphases: &quot;ecumenism&quot; (Ottmaring, Germany; Welwyn Garden City, Great Britain); &quot;ecology&quot; (Rotselaar, Belgium); &quot;interreligious dialogue&quot; (Tagaytay, Philippines); &quot;multi-ethnic harmony&quot; (Luminosa, New York; Faro, Križevci, Croatia); or &quot;inculturation&quot; (Fontem, Cameroon; Kenya; Ivory Coast). Others have the names of people who are linked to the history of the movement in a part of the world, such as &quot;Ginetta&quot; (Vargem Grande Paulista, Brazil)&quot;, Renata&quot; (Loppiano, Italy)&quot;, Piero&quot; (Nairobi, Kenya) or &quot;Lia&quot; (Chacabuco, Argentina). In these towns religious and cultural differences are peacefully present, according to the ideal of love that Chiara has always lived as the central bridge of the charism of unity.

==Development==
In November 1956, an uprising of the Hungarian people was brutally suppressed. Chiara responded by calling for an army of volunteers for the cause of God, &quot;volunteers of God&quot;: &quot;A certain society has attempted to erase the name of God, the reality of God, the providence of God and the love of God from people&#x27;s hearts. There has to be a society that can put God back in his rightful place (...). A society that witnesses to only one name: God.&quot; Thus, the &quot;volunteers of God&quot; came to life, the first of 18 branches within the Focolare Movement.

Groups met according to their area of engagement and, with Chiara&#x27;s inspiration, began centers for politics, economy, medicine, and art. These later developed into a wider movement that Chiara launched in 1968 with the name &quot;For a New Society&quot; and later changed to &quot;New Humanity.

The Focolare Movement has branched out to address a variety of groups including families, youth, and different religions. Special projects have sprung up within the movement, such as the &quot;Abba&quot; school, &quot;Young People for a United World&quot; (now Youth for a United World), Teens4unity, Economy of Communion (involving 800 companies), evangelism within small cities, social work, the Igino Giordani Centre, and 27 publishing houses. Pope Francis in praising Economy of Communion called on it to change &quot;the rules of the game of the socio-economic system.&quot; John L. Allen Jr. has observed that it is hard to &quot;pick a fight with a &quot;focolarino&quot;. They tend to be open, ego-free, and just relentlessly nice.&quot;

The president of the Focolare Movement, who is always a Catholic lay woman is Margaret Karaam, who succeeded the second president (after Chiara Lubich) Maria Voce in 2021. In accordance of the female presidency there is a male vice-president, at this moment Jésus Moran.

==Thought and Carism==
Since the late 1940s around Chiara Lubich many people saw her charisma as something different than similar branches of Christianity, such as the Third Order Franciscans of which she was initially a part. Thanks to the work of Pasquale Foresi, Giuseppe Maria &quot;Peppuccio&quot; Zanghì and since the 1990s the Abbà School a great number of people was involved in study and dissection of the theological, cultural and social implications of the charisma of unity.

Pope John Paul II described the Focolare Movement as — a &quot;small people, an expression of the great people of God, moving on towards the building of a civilization of love, towards the goal of a more united world. This movement has a specific spirituality, which is collective and also has its own well-defined culture&quot;.

Chiara said that &quot;this is a Movement, whose main objectives and goals are these: God chosen in fact as an Ideal; love chosen as a lifestyle; unity which becomes the practice binding each person to God and people with one another.&quot;

Theologically the movement can be summed up on two pillars that could be defined as &quot;Praxis of Nothingness, Jesus Forsaken, and Unity in Love (as in the Last Prayer) by keeping Jesus in the midst.&quot; These concepts are the theological core of the charisma of unity.

This thought is clearly slended towards universality grounded on the Golden Rule, and this can be seen by a strong presence in ecumenism, dialogue with believers and non-believers, international aid and adoptions and many other fields such as the collaboration with other lay organisations of the Catholic Church.

==Interreligious dialogue==

Chiara Lubich possessed &quot;an almost prophetic capacity to intuit and actualise before hand the thought of the Pope&quot;, said in a letter Pope Benedict XVI read out by Secretary of State, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, at Chiara Lubich’s funeral Mass in 2008. Pope John Paul II put his finger on one example recognising &quot;the radicalism of love of Chiara, of the Focolarini,&quot; – a &quot;Gospel radicalism of love&quot; – as an answer to what had long been his concern for a hate-dominated world. But beyond Christianity, Chiara Lubich’s spiritual experience of kenosis led her to be open to the presence of God in other religions, and in a spirituality of openness she started and pushed on dialogue. This in turn led people of other faiths to find a home in the Focolare movement.

While unity was in the Christian sphere the key attraction (for all Christians, since its source is in the Gospel of John), forsakeness/suffering was the appeal for dialogue with people of other faiths or with people without faith.

Today the Focolare Movements define 5 dialogues:

- First Dialogue, dialogue inside the Catholic Church realities in communion

- Second Dialogue, dialogue between the various churches of Christianity

- Third Dialogue, dialogue with anyone who believes in some spirituality/faith

- Fourth Dialogue, dialogue with anyone who does not believe in any spirituality/faith

- Fifth Dialogue, dialogue within the contemporary culture&#x27;s challenges, risks and opportunities.

==Renewal==
At a reorganizational meeting in 2014 newly elected council members had an average age 16 years younger than that of the previous council, and the 30 council members came from 20 countries. In Pope Francis&#x27; address to the reorganizational meeting, he said: &quot;The Work of Mary, that everyone knows as the Focolare movement, was a little seed in the Catholic Church&#x27;s womb, that in the course of the years has brought to life a tree which now extends its branches in all the expressions of the Christian family and also among members of different religions and among many who cultivate justice and solidarity together with the search for truth.&quot; Francis went on to describe elements of the movement as contemplation, going out to engage in dialogue and formation of youth. Of contemplation he said: &quot;We need to contemplate God and the beauty of his love,&quot; keeping in mind that &quot;to contemplate means to live together with brothers and sisters, breaking with them the bread of communion and fraternity,&quot; since &quot;contemplation that leaves people outside is a lie, it is narcissism.&quot;

&quot;Les Jours&quot;, an online investigative news site, published a series of articles concerning abuse within the movement. In light of allegations of sexual abuse brought against Jean-Michel Merlin, a consecrated member in France, the Focolare Movement contracted with GCPS Consulting to look into the matter. In October 2020, three senior officials of the movement stepped down amid questions regarding their handling of complaints. Focolare subsequently initiated an internal investigation into the number of cases of claimed abuse.

==Publications==
The Focolare magazine, entitled &quot;Città Nuova&quot; (&quot;new city&quot;), began at the 1956 Mariapolis from the desire of people to stay connected to the spirituality and the movement as a whole. In one of its first editorials, Chiara expressed her vision for it: &quot;We would like to collect all the various experiences of people who are bringing unity all over the world (...) so that the good that one person does will become the common good and the common good will belong to each individual.&quot;

New City Press, established in 1964, is the official publishing house for the Focolare Movement, publishing books, periodicals, and e-books. Among its publications are the &quot;Spirituality of Unity&quot; series, featuring the works of founder Chiara Lubich, and &quot;Understanding the Scriptures&quot;, Bible commentaries by scholars such as Daniel J. Harrington, Dianne Bergant, Robert Karris, and Ronald Witherup. NCP publications include: the academic journal &quot;Sophia&quot; twice a year; three quarterlies – &quot;Gen&#x27;s&quot; on ecclesial commitment as well as &quot;New Humanity,&quot; and &quot;Unity and Charisms&quot;; the bimonthly &quot;Teens&quot; for children; and the monthly periodicals &quot;Città Nuova&quot; (published in 38 different national or regional formats; known as &quot;New City&quot; in the UK, and as &quot;Living City&quot; in the US, where its editor is Jon M. Sweeney) with opinion and dialogue, &quot;Big Smart Kids&quot; including inserts for educators, and &quot;Gospel of the Day.&quot; Focolare also publishes &quot;Economy of Communion&quot;, a quarterly magazine and website.

<text>Me and Mr. Johnson is the fifteenth solo studio album recorded by Eric Clapton, released in March 2004 by Reprise Records. It consists of covers of songs written and originally recorded by Robert Johnson. The album cover was painted by Sir Peter Blake, using a series of photographs of Clapton. Clapton had planned to record an album of new material, but by the time of the recording sessions there were not enough new songs written, so the band instead recorded a series of Johnson songs.

&quot;Me and Mr. Johnson&quot; sold more than two million albums worldwide and reached the Top 10 in more than 15 countries. A companion album and video release entitled &quot;Sessions for Robert J&quot; was released on 7 December 2004, and featured different versions of each of the songs from the studio album.

==Background==
At the beginning of 2004, Clapton set out to record a new album, working with his long-time collaborator Simon Climie on several songs that Clapton wrote about love, peace and happiness. However, when it came time to record in the studio, there were not enough finished songs for an album, so Clapton suggested the band play some songs composed by Delta blues great Robert Johnson. In just two weeks, Clapton and his studio band – Andy Fairweather Low, Billy Preston, Steve Gadd, Doyle Bramhall II, and Nathan East – recorded an entire album consisting of Johnson cover songs. Clapton was very pleased with the recordings, as was Warner Bros. Records and Reprise Records manager Tom Whalley. Clapton eventually finished his original material, which was released on the album &quot;Back Home&quot; in 2005.

In February 2004, Clapton was interviewed about his new studio album:
==Critical reception==

&quot;AllMusic&quot; critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine notes Clapton sounds very &quot;comfortable and relaxed&quot; on the album, &quot;as if he was having fun making music&quot;. Erlewine calls the album &quot;simply the most enjoyable record he&#x27;s made&quot; since &quot;From the Cradle&quot; with the possible exception of &quot;Riding with the King&quot;. Comparing the album to &quot;From the Cradle&quot;, the music critic notes: &quot;in some respects it&#x27;s a better blues album than that since it never sounds as doggedly serious as that guitar-heavy affair&quot;. Erlewine finishes his review liking the album: &quot;Some [...] may find the album too slickly produced – admittedly, blues albums should never boast a credit for Pro Tools, as this does – but this is a heartfelt tribute that&#x27;s among Clapton&#x27;s most purely enjoyable albums&quot;. He awarded the release three and a half out of five possible stars. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic David Fricke felt that &quot;Clapton [goes] back to blues school on [this] cover [album], but [does] so with mutual fealty and honest delight&quot;. He notes that Clapton limits his guitar solos to &quot;a blistering chorus or two&quot; in some of the songs, &quot;to better show off the dirty-rubber swing of Clapton&#x27;s longtime road-and-studio band&quot;. The journalist finishes his review finding &quot;Clapton pays broad tribute to Johnson as a composer and public-domain synthesist&quot;. The British &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine liked the background work of Clapton&#x27;s studio band, as they seem to be an &quot;authentic, bottomless thump&quot; to the Johnson tunes and leave Clapton enough space to play &quot;devastating&quot; guitar and sing &quot;like a man who has faced down more than a few canine devils of his own&quot;. The magazine awarded the release four out of five points.

Journalist Edna Gundersen from &quot;USA Today&quot; calls the 2004 studio album a &quot;homage to the genre&#x27;s godfather in 14 electric versions of acoustic blueprints that laid the groundwork for the &#x27;60s rock explosion&quot; and rates the album with three and a half out of four possible stars, calling the songs &quot;greasy as they are graceful, conveying an earthy intensity&quot;. Critic Robert Gauthier from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; opined that &quot;Me and Mr. Johnson&quot; &quot;will likely become a coffee-table album&quot; and notes &quot;Clapton sounds reinvigorated in these 14 songs by &quot;Crossroads&quot; soul-salesman Robert Johnson, with phlegm in his throat and (relative) fire in his belly&quot;. He also liked Billy Preston&#x27;s work on keyboards and awarded the release a &quot;B+&quot; rating, meaning &quot;very good&quot;. Rob Webb from &quot;BBC Music&quot; feels that: &quot;Clapton is no longer God: he now plays the Devil. For him to take on Johnson&#x27;s catalogue makes perfect sense. With both wailing electric guitar and acoustic-slide under his arm, Eric runs through &#x27;When You Got a Good Friend&#x27;, &#x27;Milkcow&#x27;s Calf Blues&#x27;, &#x27;Come On In My Kitchen&#x27; and a dozen other tried and tested Johnson tunes. They are all delivered with sincerity, love and respect. The band are as tight as a bottle-stop, the recording is as clear as a bell and Clapton&#x27;s singing and playing sound just fine. Me and Mr Johnson will appeal to his AOR audience after a bit of authentic as much as it will to staunch blues fans hungry for digital-age renditions of Johnson standards&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; critic Christopher Walsh thinks that on &quot;Me and Mr. Johnson&quot; &quot;Clapton is in fine form, setting aside the slick instrumentation and production that have marked much of his more recent work in favor of a smaller ensemble&quot;, creating as the result &quot;a sparse sound, allowing Clapton&#x27;s usual outstanding lead and slide guitar work to shine. Clapton and the stellar musicians behind him are obviously passionate about the music&quot;. Although Walsh liked the music on the album, he would like Clapton to &quot;let it loose&quot; more.

==Commercial success==
===North America and Asia===
When the album was officially announced, experts from the American &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine concluded &quot;Me and Mr. Johnson&quot; would sell more than 100,000 copies in its first week on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. As it turned out, the blues cover album sold 128,000 copies in its first week in the U.S., peaking at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart in 2004. The album reached the same position on the magazine&#x27;s Top Internet Albums chart and topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Blues albums chart for a total of eleven weeks and stayed 90 weeks on the chart. While charting on the Top 200 albums chart in its twelfth week, &quot;Me and Mr. Johnson&quot; became the week&#x27;s greatest gainer with sales of 17,000 copies in July 2004. On 7 July the same year, the album was certified with a gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) commemorating sales of 500,000 copies in the U.S. The album stayed a total of 18 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart. Overall in 2004, &quot;Me and Mr. Johnson&quot; was the 137th best-selling album as well as the 21st most-purchased album over the Internet and the best-selling blues album in the United States for this period. In 2005, the album was the 5th best-selling blues album in North America. In Canada, the album peaked at number three on the Canadian Albums Chart, compiled by the &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine and was later awarded a Gold presentation by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA), selling more than 50,000 copies in the country. However, the album went on to sale more than 60,000 units. In Japan, the album peaked at number eight on the &quot;Oricon&quot; albums chart in 2004 and went on to become the 84th best-selling album in Japan in 2004. It was also certified with a Gold disc in that region by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for sales exceeding 100,000 copies and had sold more than 150,000 copies in the nation. In South Korea, the album sold about 2,500 copies and peaked at number seven on the Gaon albums chart for international releases. The album reached position 22 in the state of Hong Kong.

===Africa, South America and Oceania===
In South Africa, the album peaked at number three on the charts, compiled by the Recording Industry of South Africa (RiSA). &quot;Me and Mr. Johnson&quot; was also successful in South America, as it went to number nine on the Mexican albums chart and stayed a total of 32 weeks on the official albums chart compiled by Asociación Mexicana de Productores de Fonogramas y Videogramas (AMPROFON) for the nation. A little less successful was the release in Brazil, where the album only peaked at number 49 on the album charts and stayed just two weeks on the Associação Brasileira dos Produtores de Discos (ABPD) compilation. In Oceania, the album was slightly more successful as it peaked at number 23 on the ARIA charts in Australia, where it stayed three weeks on chart. For the year-ending of 2001, &quot;Me and Mr. Johnson&quot; was the 11th best-selling Jazz/Blues album in the country. In New Zealand however, the album was certified with a Platinum disc by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ), exceeding sales figures of more than 15,000 copies in the country as &quot;Me and Mr. Johnson&quot; peaked at number 14 and stayed four weeks on chart.

==&quot;Sessions for Robert J&quot;==
Sessions for Robert J is the sixteenth solo studio album by the British rock guitarist and singer-songwriter Eric Clapton and was released on 7 December 2004 through Reprise Records. The release is a companion project to his previously released album &quot;Me and Mr. Johnson&quot;. A DVD shows Clapton and his band traveling around the United Kingdom and United States just before and after his 2004 &quot;Crossroads Guitar Festival&quot;, recording some takes of Johnson&#x27;s songs on video. Songs that were not included on the first album include: &quot;From Four &#x27;Til Late&quot;, &quot;Terraplane Blues&quot;, &quot;Ramblin&#x27; on my Mind&quot;, &quot;Sweet Home Chicago&quot;, and &quot;Stones in My Passway&quot;. Several songs are performed in duet by Clapton on steel-string acoustic guitar and Doyle Bramhall II on steel string acoustic and dobro guitars. Between sessions, Clapton discusses Johnson&#x27;s profound influence on him and other musicians. One notable segment features Clapton performing in the 508 Park Avenue building in Dallas, Texas, that served as a makeshift studio in 1937 for Johnson to cut his legendary recordings.

===Background===
In his 2007 autobiography, Clapton wrote that he asked his long-time friend Hiroshi Fujiwara to direct a video which would accompany some tracks from his then-new studio release &quot;Me and Mr. Johnson&quot; for either TV or Internet broadcasting, (but not for commercials). Fujiwara agreed to work with Clapton on the project but also suggested that his friend Stephen Schible, the producer of the movie &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;, work with him and Clapton. When Schible got to the scene, he quickly decided to go beyond the idea of doing some short-form videos that Clapton had suggested and film a whole documentary about why Clapton loved Robert Johnson and how Johnson influenced him, as well as other musicians and the blues in general. When Clapton agreed and finished filming for the video release, he was amazed by the recordings and consented to release them. With &quot;Sessions for Robert J&quot;, Clapton felt he had paid his dues to Robert Johnson.

===Critical reception===
Canadian music journalist Darryl Sterdan from &quot;Jam!&quot; magazine liked both the compact disc and DVD video release, noting that Clapton &quot;picked up where he left off with last spring&#x27;s &quot;Me and Mr. Johnson&quot;, covering more classics by Delta blues pioneer Robert Johnson in assorted settings&quot;. Sterdan awarded the release four out of five possible stars, especially enjoying the recordings from 508 Park Avenue, where several blues icons had recorded their music more than 60 years ago. &quot;AllMusic&quot; critic Thom Jurek liked &quot;Sessions for Robert J&quot; and awarded the release three out of possible five stars. For his review for the &quot;AllMusic&quot; website, Jurek notes:

===Chart performance===
&quot;Sessions for Robert J&quot; was not very successful on the album charts, possibly due to its predecessor released earlier in Spring of 2004. However, the compact disc album peaked at number 74 on the official Austrian album charts where it stayed for one week on the chart in 2004. In France, the album reached number 120 on the album charts, compiled by the Syndicat National de l&#x27;Édition Phonographique and spent a total of six weeks on the chart, reaching even into the next year. In Japan, &quot;Sessions for Robert J&quot; sold about 6,000 units in its first week on the chart, peaking at number 189. By the end of 2011, however, the release sold 60,000 copies in the Asian country. In Canada, the album did not reach the music charts, but was a medium success, selling about 20,000 copies in the country. In the United Kingdom, the album also did not reach the official albums chart, however, it sold close to 25,000 copies. In the United States, both the album and the video release were most successful, reaching position 172 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart, where the album stayed for two weeks. The release also topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Blues albums chart, and spent a total of 49 weeks on the genre chart until 2006. The video DVD release reached number 21 on the American Top Music Video charts, also compiled by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine. In the United States alone, the album sold more than 230,000 copies. In total, &quot;Sessions for Robert J&quot; has sold more than 400,000 copies worldwide. For the year-ending of 2005, &quot;Sessions for Robert J&quot; was the 3rd best-selling blues album in the United States.

<text>Far Cry is a 2004 first-person shooter video game developed by Crytek and published by Ubisoft. It is the first installment in the &quot;Far Cry&quot; franchise. Set on a mysterious tropical archipelago, the game follows Jack Carver, a former American special forces operative, as he searches for journalist Valerie Constantine, who accompanied him to the islands but went missing after their boat was destroyed by mercenaries. As Jack explores the islands, he begins to discover the horrific genetic experiments being conducted on the local wildlife and must confront the mad scientist behind them.

The game was the first to use Crytek&#x27;s CryEngine, and was designed as an open-ended first-person shooter, though it lacks most of the freedom its successors would offer to the player. While players can freely explore the game&#x27;s world like in later &quot;Far Cry&quot; titles, they are most often discouraged from doing so due to the linear structure of missions and the lack of side content. Despite this, the gameplay formula established in &quot;Far Cry&quot;—placing the player in a foreign environment occupied by enemy forces where they must use various weapons and tools, as well as their surroundings to overcome any threat—would prove essential in defining the series&#x27; identity going forward.

&quot;Far Cry&quot; was released for Microsoft Windows in March 2004 to generally positive reviews, being praised for its visuals, gameplay mechanics, and the level of freedom given to players. The game was also a commercial success, selling over 730,000 units within four months of release and over 2.5 million units in its lifetime. The success of &quot;Far Cry&quot; led to a series of standalone sequels developed by Ubisoft, starting with &quot;Far Cry 2&quot; in 2008. A remake of the game with a different storyline and new mechanics, &quot;Far Cry Instincts&quot;, was released for the Xbox in 2005, and for the Xbox 360 in 2006 as part of the &quot;Far Cry Instincts: Predator&quot; compilation. A loose film adaptation was released in 2008. The original version of &quot;Far Cry&quot;, updated with HD graphics, was re-released under the title Far Cry Classic for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2014.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Far Cry&quot; is a standard first-person shooter set in an open-ended environment: an unidentified archipelago in the South Pacific. The tropical rain forest provides cover and concealment, of which both the player and enemies can take advantage. Enemies react dynamically to the player&#x27;s tactics and actions. If a lone mercenary spots a player, he occasionally runs for help, signaling reinforcements through use of flareguns. Enemies will work together to outmaneuver, outflank, surround, and provide suppressive fire, providing them a tactical advantage over the player, who, in turn, is able to spot and mark enemies on their minimap through use of special binoculars, which also grant the player the ability to listen to enemy conversations from afar, merely by pointing the binoculars in the direction of the enemies. Later in the gameplay, thermo binoculars can be used to locate the heat signatures of enemies, that would be otherwise concealed by foliage or darkness.

The environment includes land, water, indoor and outdoor structures, all during various times of the day. The player has the ability to jump, run, crouch and lie down, and look about in all directions. Sound plays an important part in the overall gameplay. For example, the general location of enemies can often be identified by hearing their footsteps or conversations. Throughout the game, the player encounters a variety of weapons from which to choose, including automatic weapons and grenades.

The open maps allow the player to complete their objectives in several different manners. When outdoors, the player is usually presented with a fairly simple set of possible routes to their objective, but these do not necessarily have to be used. Outdoor map level designs are constructed in a way that allows the player to try different angles for assaults, or even completely circumvent enemies (given enough time to maneuver). However, during the indoor sections of the game, level design tends to lose this attribute in favor of a more traditional, linear gameplay.

===Multiplayer===
The game included three multiplayer modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and &#x27;Assault&#x27; - An attack/defend mode where one team must guard three bases and the other must capture them. Ubisoft closed the online servers in October 2015.

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
The game&#x27;s story follows a retired U.S. Army Special Forces soldier stranded on a mysterious archipelago. He is searching for a female journalist named Valerie Constantine, after she went missing when their boat was destroyed by mercenaries. The game includes thematic elements relating to the dangers of weaponizing genetic engineering and the genocide of local islanders as can be seen by the deformed creatures created by a mad scientist named Krieger.

The terrain in &quot;Far Cry&quot; varies greatly. Set on a South Pacific archipelago, the landscape includes beaches, dense rain forests, towering canyons, mines, swamps, and even volcanic forests. Many of the interiors range from simple beach huts and army camps to elaborate complexes, an underground temple, and ultra-modern research labs. Several of these mazes use the remains of Japanese World War II-era fortifications and bunkers.

===Plot===
Jack Carver has left his mysterious and bitter past behind him and dropped out of society to run a boat-charter business in the South Pacific. He is hired by a female journalist named Valerie Constantine to take her secretly to an uncharted island in Micronesia. After Val takes off on her own with a jet ski, Jack&#x27;s boat is blown apart by a rocket, but he survives by diving into the water. With the help of a man named Doyle, Jack travels across the various islands, battling mysterious mercenaries in search for Val. Through encounters with Trigens (genetically altered beasts) and information from Doyle, Jack soon discovers that the island is part of an experiment involving genetic modification, funded by the genetic company Krieger Corp. and led by its CEO, Dr. Krieger.

As the game progresses, it becomes clear that the Trigens, who are running loose, are becoming too large a problem for the mercenaries to handle, and that the experiments are not limited to just primate mutations, but have moved on to mutating humans (possibly mercenaries). When Jack finally catches up with Val, she is being taken to another area by a helicopter which is stopped by Jack. After a brief struggle on board the helicopter, Val tells Jack to jump for it, kicking him in the face and they both fall from the helicopter as it explodes. After they both swim to shore, Val reveals that she is an undercover CIA agent investigating Krieger&#x27;s operations. After further exploration, Jack must again search for and rescue Val while the human Trigens have escaped (freed by Jack) and have begun a revolt against the mercenaries on the island. After rescuing Val, they split up again and reunite when Jack has killed the mercenary commander, Crowe. Information Crowe had with him indicates Krieger has a tactical nuke on the island, which he intends to use as a last resort in covering his tracks should his projects be investigated.

After the Department of Defense has supposedly analyzed the situation, Jack and Val steal the nuclear weapon, despite Jack&#x27;s protests. Before entering the factory, Doyle warns that the mutagen might infect them when the blast goes off, and advises them to take a mutagen-resistant serum before arming the nuke. Inside the factory, they do so and arm the nuke, which detonates directly behind Jack and Val as they exit the factory, leaving them unconscious. While the pair are unconscious, Krieger captures them before leaving to his main base in a helicopter. Jack, kicked off the helicopter, has to fight through the Trigen-infested area to rescue Val and escape the islands with his life. Upon reaching a mercenary weapons cache, Jack notices his arm is turning green. Doyle responds that the mutagen concentration on the air might be too strong for the antidote, but Krieger is working on a cure in a laboratory nearby. Jack is thus directed to find Krieger, who has injected himself with the mutagen but is ultimately defeated.

With his dying breath, Krieger reveals that there is no cure for the mutagen. Doyle reveals the &quot;antidote&quot; they took earlier was the very mutagen they were trying to protect themselves from and reveals that he plans to sell the mutagen formula on the black market before fleeing. After battling through a horde of Trigens, Jack catches up with Doyle and kills him. Jack then escapes just before the volcano, in which Krieger&#x27;s main offices are located, erupts. Both he and Val are cured from the mutagen and manage to sail off on a boat.

==Development and release==

Crytek developed a game engine called CryEngine for &quot;Far Cry&quot;. Reportedly, the game was born out of a technology demo called &quot;X-Isle: Dinosaur Island&quot; made by Crytek to showcase the capabilities of the Nvidia GeForce 3.

On June 10, 2013, Ubisoft announced &quot;Far Cry Classic&quot; would come to XBLA as part of Microsoft&#x27;s 2013 Summer Arcade releases. The game was delayed to February 12, 2014. &quot;Far Cry Classic&quot; is an HD remake for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The game is available as a standalone and part of a compilation called &quot;Far Cry: The Wild Expedition&quot;.

In June 2023, the game&#x27;s source code was leaked online.

==Reception==
&quot;Far Cry&quot; received &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. The game received runner-up placements for GameSpot&#x27;s 2004 &quot;Best Shooter&quot; and &quot;Best Graphics, Technical&quot; awards across all platforms. It received multiple awards at the Deutscher Entwicklerpreis 2004, including &quot;Best Full-Price Game&quot;.

===Sales===
&quot;Far Cry&quot; was a commercial success, with sales above 730,000 units after four months of release. It received a &quot;Gold&quot; certification from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland for its performance through the end of June 2004. This indicated sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Switzerland and Austria. In the United States, &quot;Far Cry&quot; sold 350,000 copies and earned $11 million for Crytek by August 2006. At the time, this led &quot;Edge&quot; to declare it the country&#x27;s 49th-best-selling computer game released since January 2000. It also earned a &quot;Gold&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), for sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom. In 2010, Crytek announced that the PC version of the game had sold over 2.5 million units overall.

==Legacy==

On April 8, 2004, Ubisoft announced &quot;Far Cry Instincts&quot; for the Xbox. &quot;Far Cry Instincts&quot; is not a direct port of the original, being designed specifically for consoles. The game uses a similar premise to the original PC version, and the same game engine, but by comparison &quot;Instincts&quot; is less open-ended and more linear, due to the console&#x27;s reduced processing power which prevents the full rendering of the PC version&#x27;s vast islands and landscape. Additionally, &quot;Instincts&quot; features a significantly altered storyline, and new multiplayer modes, weapons, dual wielding and &quot;feral abilities&quot;. PlayStation 2 and GameCube were also planned but were cancelled. &quot;Far Cry Instincts&quot; was exclusive to the Xbox and was released to acclaim in North America on September 27, 2005.

On March 28, 2006, Ubisoft released a sequel to &quot;Instincts&quot;, &quot;Far Cry Instincts: Evolution&quot; for the Xbox, which was met with less enthusiasm than the first versions of &quot;Far Cry&quot;. On the same day, for the Xbox 360, &quot;Far Cry Instincts: Predator&quot; was released, which essentially contains updated versions of &quot;Instincts&quot; and &quot;Evolution&quot; that can run in 720p or 1080i high-definition. &quot;Evolution&quot; includes a new single-player campaign, although it is considerably shorter than that of &quot;Far Cry Instincts&quot;. The storyline focuses on Jack Carver&#x27;s work for a woman named Kade, which leads him to be hunted by local governments due to a frame-up during a botched arms deal. Jack again meets up with Doyle, who is practicing damage control, and eventually must battle a native warrior named Semeru who possesses the same &quot;feral abilities&quot; as Jack.

A remake of &quot;Far Cry Instincts: Evolution&quot;, titled &quot;Far Cry Vengeance&quot;, was released as part of Ubisoft&#x27;s launch lineup for the Wii. In this version, the Wii Remote is used for many of the tasks assigned to buttons in previous iterations of the game, including driving vehicles, shooting, and running.

Crytek was commissioned by Electronic Arts to continue development on the Crytek engine, which led to their series of games, &quot;Crysis&quot;. As Crytek was locked into its contract with Electronic Arts, Ubisoft negotiated to hold the rights to &quot;Far Cry&quot; as well as a perpetual license for the CryEngine, which they continued to modify with their Dunia Engine. In 2008, &quot;Far Cry 2&quot; was released, developed by Ubisoft Montreal. &quot;Far Cry 2&quot; centers around the activities of a gun smuggler named The Jackal. Fan theories, based on the appearance of the Jackal as well as game files, claim that the Jackal was an aged Jack Carver. &quot;Far Cry 2&quot;″s director, Clint Hocking, confirmed this was intentional in a 2021 interview, with the trauma of events of &quot;Far Cry&quot; leading Carver to turn to criminal smuggling ten years later. Several more &quot;Far Cry&quot; sequels have been released by Ubisoft since.

On October 2, 2008, a live-action film based on the video game was released in Germany and later on December 17, 2008, in American theaters, receiving overwhelmingly negative reviews. A reboot was planned in 2013, and later adapted into a Netflix series instead.

<text>In ancient Greece, a hecatomb (; ; &quot;hekatómbē&quot;) was a sacrifice of 100 cattle (&quot;hekaton&quot; &quot;one hundred&quot;, &quot;bous&quot; &quot;bull&quot;) to the Greek gods. In practice, as few as 12 could make up a hecatomb.

Although originally the sacrifice of a hundred oxen in the religious ceremonies of the Greeks and Romans; later &quot;hecatomb&quot; came to describe a large number of any kind of animals devoted to sacrifice. Figuratively, &quot;hecatomb&quot; is used to describe the sacrifice or destruction by fire, tempest, disease, or the sword of any large number of persons or animals; and also of the wholesale destruction of inanimate objects, and even of mental and moral attributes.

==Ancient Greece==
Hecatombs were offered to Greek gods Hera, Athena, and Apollo during special religious ceremonies. At the end of the Olympic Games, a hecatomb was also offered to Zeus at Olympia.

In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, hecatombs are described formulaically. The following is one instance, from Samuel Butler&#x27;s translation:

<doc id="677754" wikidata="Q7236582" url="?curid=677754" title="Power of the purse">
<text>The power of the purse is the ability of one group to control the actions of another group by withholding funding, or putting stipulations on the use of funds. The power of the purse can be used positively (e.g. awarding extra funding to programs that reach certain benchmarks) or negatively (e.g. removing funding for a department or program, effectively eliminating it). The power of the purse is most often utilized by forces within a government that do not have direct executive power, but have control over budgets and taxation.

== Canada ==

In colonial Canada, the fight for &quot;responsible government&quot; in the 1840s centered on question of whether elected parliaments or appointed governors would have control over the purse strings, mirroring earlier fights between Parliament and the Crown in Britain.

After confederation, the phrase &quot;power of the purse&quot; took on a particular meaning. It now primarily refers to the federal government&#x27;s superior tax-raising abilities compared to the provinces, and the consequent ability of the federal government to compel provincial governments to adopt certain policies in exchange for transfer payments. Most famously, the Canada Health Act sets rules that provinces must follow to receive health transfers (the largest of all such transfers). Opponents of this arrangement refer to this situation as the &quot;fiscal imbalance&quot;, while others argue for the federal government&#x27;s role in setting minimum standards for social programs in Canada.

==United Kingdom==
The power of the purse&#x27;s earliest examples in a modern sense occurred in the English Parliament, which gained the exclusive power to authorise taxes and thus could control the nation&#x27;s cash flow. Through this power, Parliament slowly subverted the executive strength of the crown; King Charles II was limited in his powers to engage in various war efforts by a refusal by Parliament to authorise further taxes and by his inability to secure loans from foreign nations, making him much less powerful.

In recent years as a result of devolution, funding for devolved issues to the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly has been determined through the Barnett Formula. This formula determines the overall budget of the devolved parliaments for devolved issues proportionally relative to spending on those issues in England. As a result, while responsibility for funding of devolved matters rests with the devolved bodies themselves, they in effect must enact policies of a broadly similar cost to those decided by the UK parliament for England and maintain that broad proportionality in order to ensure the long-term financial viability of such policies.

==United States==
In the federal government of the United States, the power of the purse is vested in the Congress as laid down in the Constitution of the United States, Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 (the Appropriations Clause) and Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 (the Taxing and Spending Clause).

The power of the purse plays a critical role in the relationship of the United States Congress and the President of the United States, and has been the main historic tool by which Congress has limited executive power. One of the most prominent examples is the Foreign Assistance Act of 1974, which eliminated all military funding for the government of South Vietnam and thereby ended the Vietnam War. Other recent examples include limitations on military funding placed on Ronald Reagan by Congress, which led to the withdrawal of United States Marines from Lebanon.

The power of the purse in military affairs was famously subverted during the Iran-Contra scandal in the 1980s. Congress denied further aid to the Contras in Nicaragua. Unwilling to accept the will of Congress, members of the Reagan administration solicited private donations, set up elaborate corporate schemes and brokered illegal arms deals with Iran in order to generate unofficial funds that could not be regulated by Congress.

More recently, budget limitations and using the power of the purse formed a controversial part of discussion regarding Congressional opposition to the Iraq War. On March 23, 2007, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a supplemental war budget that imposed a timeline on the presence of American combat troops in Iraq, but the legislation was not passed.

The power of the purse has also been used to compel the U.S. states to pass laws, in cases where Congress does not have the desire or constitutional power to make it a federal matter. The most well-known example of this is regarding the drinking age, where Congress passed a law to withhold 10% of federal funds for highways in any state that did not raise the age to 21. The law was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in the &quot;South Dakota v. Dole&quot; case. Congress was not allowed to change the drinking age directly because the 21st Amendment (which ended Prohibition in the U.S.) gave control of alcohol to the states. In 2009, Congress considered similar legislation regarding texting while driving.

This power was curtailed somewhat in a case regarding the Affordable Care Act, in which the Supreme Court ruled in June 2012 that the law&#x27;s withholding of all existing Medicaid funding for states that failed or refused to expand their Medicaid programs to cover the uninsured poor was &quot;unduly coercive&quot;, despite the fact that the federal government would pay the entirety of the states&#x27; expansion for the first years, and 90% thereafter. It was left unclear what percentage would be considered acceptable.

===Other uses===
In the US House or Senate, the chair of a legislative committee may refuse to give funding to a senator or other delegate or representative, or deny their appropriations bill or amendment a vote, because they refused to support a bill which the chair wanted (a tit-for-tat retaliation). While typically applied to &quot;pork barrel&quot; spending for , it may also block funding for genuine needs of a constituency or the general public.

The administration or student government at a college or university may revoke some or even all funding for a student newspaper or student radio station, because it has printed or aired an editorial or a news article or segment critical of it. This is also an example of censorship.

<doc id="677762" wikidata="Q1378808" url="?curid=677762" title="Eberron">
<text>Eberron is a campaign setting for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;D&amp;D&quot;) role-playing game. The game is set primarily on the continent of Khorvaire following a vast destructive war. Eberron is designed to accommodate traditional &quot;D&amp;D&quot; elements and races within a differently toned setting; Eberron combines a fantasy tone with pulp and dark adventure elements, and some non-traditional fantasy technologies such as trains, skyships, and mechanical beings which are all powered by magic.

Eberron was created by author and game designer Keith Baker as the winning entry for Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s Fantasy Setting Search, a competition run in 2002 to establish a new setting for the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; game. Eberron was chosen from more than 11,000 entries, and was officially released with the publication of the &quot;Eberron Campaign Setting&quot; hardback book in June 2004.

== Creative origins ==
Keith Baker&#x27;s &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; campaign setting of Eberron was chosen as the winner among the 11,000 submissions to the Wizards of the Coast Fantasy Setting Search in 2002. Baker won $100,000 for his contest submission. The original title of Baker&#x27;s setting was the &quot;Thrilling Tales of Swords and Sorcery&quot;. Baker highlighted that the setting went through multiple stages of development:&quot;Thrilling Tales&quot; wasn&#x27;t Eberron. It went through four stages of development. First there was the original one page concept, which went up against thousands of others. The next step was expanding that into ten pages, fleshing out the core idea. From there I wrote a hundred page story bible. But even then, it was still &quot;Thrilling Tales of Swords and Sorcery&quot;. Once &quot;Thrilling Tales&quot; was chosen as the final setting, I went to Seattle and spent weeks working with an amazing team of people at Wizards of the Coast: Bill Slavicsek, Chris Perkins, James Wyatt, and many others. Together we isolated the best parts of &quot;Thrilling Tales&quot;, as well as identifying the elements that didn&#x27;t work and finding ways to improve them. [...] [It] was Bill Slavicsek who named the world Eberron. On the Fantasy Setting Search contest, Slavicsek highlighted that four subteams reduced the 11,000 submissions to 120 entries which were then reviewed by a panel who whittled it down to eleven proposals. These eleven contest submitters were then asked to expand their one-page submissions and from these new ten-page submissions, the panel further reduced the proposals to just three entries. Slavicsek said: [A]t this point, we learned the names of the authors and we flew each of them to Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s offices to meet with them. During those meetings, I began to direct each project in earnest, just as I would direct any product published through the efforts of my R&amp;D team. It was great meeting Keith Baker, Rich Burlew, and Nathan Toomey in person, getting to talk about their worlds with them, and getting to help them each make their vision come alive. We gave them an outline form to follow so they could create 125-page world bibles [...]. All three [proposals] were great, but we had to select the one we were going to put our efforts behind. That one was Keith Baker&#x27;s world, the world that became Eberron.

The inspiration for Eberron came when Baker was working on VR-1&#x27;s cancelled pulp MMORPG &quot;Lost Continents&quot;. Baker aimed to fuse the energy of pulp adventure and film noir settings to traditional fantasy settings and steampunk. The &quot;Eberron Campaign Setting&quot; sourcebook lists the following films as inspirations for Eberron&#x27;s tone and attitude: &quot;Brotherhood of the Wolf&quot;, &quot;Casablanca&quot;, &quot;From Hell&quot;, &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, &quot;The Mummy&quot;, &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;, &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;, &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; and &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;. Baker also said inspiration for the war-torn setting came from the unstable period of world history between World War I and II.

==Publication history==

The 2004 campaign setting book for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; v3.5 was written by Keith Baker, Bill Slavicsek, and James Wyatt. In June 2005, the &quot;Eberron Campaign Setting&quot; book won the Origins Award for &quot;Best Roleplaying Game Supplement of 2004&quot;. Over the next four years, over 20 supplements for &quot;Eberron&quot; were released. Shannon Appelcline, author of &quot;Designers &amp; Dragons&quot;, wrote &quot;meanwhile, it had also become the setting for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online&quot; (2006), Atari&#x27;s major multimedia expansion of the D&amp;D brand. By 2009, Eberron was still &quot;big&quot;, and that&#x27;s why it won out as 4e&#x27;s second setting&quot;.

In June 2009, the &quot;Eberron Player&#x27;s Guide&quot; and the free adventure &quot;Khyber&#x27;s Harvest&quot; (2009) brought the setting to the new 4th Edition of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;. It was followed in July by the &quot;Eberron Campaign Guide&quot; (2009) and the not-free adventure &quot;Seekers of the Ashen Crown&quot; (2009). The development of the 4th Edition of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; brought many design changes including the addition of a new default setting that followed the new &quot;Points of Light&quot; design philosophy – a world that looked less like the modern world, &quot;full of civilized countries with civilized borders&quot;, and more like a world with few centers of civilization separated by the open, dangerous wilderness. On the impact of the edition change, Appelcline wrote: Players were wondering if Eberron would also be changed to more closely match the Points of Light ideals and surprisingly … it wasn&#x27;t. Instead, Eberron appears much as it did before. There wasn&#x27;t even a timeline change; though rumors at one points suggested a two-year advancement was in the works, the world ended up remaining in 998YK. Eberron&#x27;s designers and developers said that players interested in metaplot should read the novels and decide themselves whether they wanted to include those events in their games. Though Eberron didn&#x27;t become a Points of Light world, it did adopt many of the other assumptions of 4e.

In February 2015, the very first instance of the online feature &quot;Unearthed Arcana&quot; provided Eberron content for public playtesting for the 5th Edition. However, further official Eberron content did not appear until 3 years later, when the &quot;&quot; was released on July 23, 2018, as a PDF on Dungeon Masters Guild; it was described as a &quot;living document&quot; that would be updated as the included concepts were refined. Over the next year, various features such as races, dragonmarks, magic items, as well as the artificer class and subclasses, went through the &quot;Unearthed Arcana&quot; public playtest process. An &quot;exploratory campaign featuring Eberron&quot; was released for the D&amp;D Adventurers League as PDFs between September and December 2018.

&quot;&quot;, a hardcover setting book, was published on November 19, 2019. An alternative art cover by Vance Kelly for the book was also released in local game stores on November 17. At the same time, the &quot;Wayfinder&#x27;s Guide to Eberron&quot; was updated to include the final versions of the included content as it appears in &quot;Eberron: Rising from the Last War&quot;, and added the artificer class from the same book (with only one subclass – the Alchemist – of the three included in &quot;Rising from the Last War&quot;). To correspond with this release, the D&amp;D Adventurers League added a new season of stories called &quot;The Oracle of War&quot; that take place in the Mournland. Shawn Merwin, Adventurers League Resource Manager, wrote that the &quot;Oracle of War&quot; storyline is a &quot;very different type of campaign from what has come before [in Adventurers League]. The story presented in &quot;Oracle of War&quot; plays out in 20 Core Storyline adventures that take characters from level 1 to 20. [...] Core Storyline adventures are placed on the DMs Guild at the rate of one per month, giving the campaign an active play period of approximately 2 years&quot;. 

The upcoming setting sourcebook &quot;Eberron: Forge of the Artificer&quot; (2025) is scheduled to be published on August 19, 2025. As part of the 2024 revision to the 5th Edition ruleset, the sourcebook will expand on the world of Eberron along with revising the ruleset. This will include a revised artificer character class, revised Dragonmarks, revised species of the setting, the introduction of the khoravar (Eberron&#x27;s half-elves) as a new species choice, and three campaign outlines. 

== Characteristics ==

One of the most obvious differences between Eberron and generic &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; is the level of magic. High-level magic, including &quot;resurrection&quot; spells, is less common than in most other settings. However, low-level magic is much more pervasive, primarily provided by the Dragonmarked houses. Many cities have magical lanterns throughout the streets. A continent-spanning magical &quot;lightning rail&quot; provides high speed transportation.

Alignment is slightly more muddied than in other official settings. Evil beings of traditionally good races and good beings of traditionally evil races are encouraged, but alignment definition remains true to D&amp;D standards, with good and evil retaining their meanings. However, the situation often arises in the campaign world that oppositely aligned characters will side with each other briefly if a threat looms over all, and also both good and evil characters will infiltrate each other&#x27;s organizations for purposes of espionage.

Religion is similarly less clear-cut. The pantheon of Eberron does not make itself overtly known. The existence of divine magic is not evidence of the gods, as clerics who worship no deities but instead follow a path or belief system also receive spells. A cleric can even actively work against their own church and continue to receive spells. As a result, religion is largely a matter of faith. Unlike in many other 3rd edition &quot;D&amp;D&quot; settings, a cleric does not have to be within one step of his deity&#x27;s or religion&#x27;s alignment, and is not restricted from casting certain spells because of alignment.

The setting adds a new base character class, the artificer. Artificers are spellcasters focusing on magical item creation. Artificer infusions (their equivalent to spells) focus on temporarily imbuing objects with the desired effects. For example, instead of casting &quot;bull&#x27;s strength&quot; on a character, an artificer would cast it upon a belt to create a short term magical Belt of Bull&#x27;s Strength. Artificers have access to a pool of &quot;craft points&quot; which act as extra experience points (only) for use in creating magical items without sacrificing level attainment. This pool is refilled when the artificer gains levels, or by draining power from an existing magical item (destroying the item in the process).

Eberron also introduced a new non-player character class known as the magewright, which is an arcane caster who has a limited selection of low-level spells. The existence of magewrights is part of the reason for the prevalence of low-level magic in Eberron.

To try to create a pulp setting, Eberron initially used &quot;action points&quot; that allow a player to add a six-sided die to the result of rolls made with a twenty-sided die. Characters receive a set allotment of single-use action points each character level. The Eberron Campaign Setting also includes feats which grant additional uses for action points, such as allowing a player to add an eight-sided die instead of a six-sided die, or spending two action points to grant your character an additional move or standard action. Certain class features with uses per day, like a barbarian&#x27;s rage ability, a cleric&#x27;s turn/rebuke undead ability, or a druid&#x27;s wild shape ability, can be used again by spending 2 action points. The final use for action points is to spend one to stabilize a dying character.

== Fictional setting ==

=== World ===
The world of Eberron contains seven continents. The setting primarily takes place in Khorvaire, the most populated continent. Humans are the most populous race in Khorvaire, living primarily in the area known as the Five Nations. Southeast is the small continent of Aerenal, ruled by elves. Due south is the jungle continent of Xen&#x27;drik, once ruled by an empire of giants that collapsed. It is now largely wilderness, with some areas under tribal dominion of the drow. Further south of Xen&#x27;drik is Everice, a continent-sized sheet of ice possibly covering several land masses. Frostfell is an unexplored land of ice in the north. The other two main continents are Sarlona (a continent ruled by quori, creatures from the Region of Dreams) and Argonnessen (a continent inhabited by dragons). The world of Eberron has twelve moons; some sages believe there is a thirteenth moon that has vanished or is invisible to the naked eye.

The World of Eberron comprises a number of features for the Eberron campaign setting. The number 13, also known as a &quot;baker&#x27;s dozen&quot;, has been part of a theme Keith Baker used regarding aspects of the world.

&quot;Eberron&quot; is also the name for the land of the world, and is referred to as the Dragon Between. Siberys, the Dragon Above, is the name given to the planetary rings which surround the planet. Khyber, the Dragon Below, is the name given to the underworld, and is similar to the Underdark in many other settings. According to the creation story, the world was formed when the progenitor wyrms changed their form into what they are now. Siberys and Khyber fought, leading to Siberys&#x27; body being broken into pieces. To stop Khyber, Eberron wrapped around him, and Siberys&#x27; broken body became a ring around them both. Siberys created the dragons, Eberron created humanoids and other &quot;lower races&quot;, and Khyber created the &quot;demons&quot; of the world. According to Keith Baker, there is some significance to the fact that each name contains the morpheme &quot;ber&quot;, but he has not stated what this is.

==== Dragonmarks ====

Dragonmarks and the hereditary Dragonmarked Houses were created for the setting as a way to incorporate magic across society in Eberron. Baker compared the Dragonmarked Houses to the &quot;Spacing Guild from &quot;Dune&quot;&quot; as these &quot;houses are powers that exist beyond the rule of princes or kings&quot;. He explained that the original idea of granting all humanoids minor magical gifts &quot;made the world a little too chaotic and unfocused&quot; which led to the development of &quot;twelve extended families, each of which possessed a specific magical gift&quot;. By wielding the dragonmarks, these families would have importance and &quot;economic influence&quot; in the setting along with distinct agendas and in-fighting which creates narrative opportunities for both player characters and Dungeon Masters. Appelcline referred to Eberron&#x27;s dragonmarks as &quot;one of the most notable new game systems in 3e&quot; and emphasized that each mark had a unique effect, with many being &quot;restricted by race&quot;. 

Appelcline highlighted that the designers of 4th Edition &quot;decided&quot; the original iteration of dragonmarks &quot;hadn&#x27;t served their intended purpose&quot; as players did not utilize them &quot;enough&quot; since the &quot;powers were often more interesting for NPCs of the Dragonmark Houses&quot; and many players did not reach the higher levels where dragonmarks became &quot;really powerful&quot;. The 4th Edition iteration were &quot;redesigned to improve existing powers&quot; and simplified by removing the hierarchy of dragonmarks and the race restrictions for player characters. Dragonmarks and the associated houses returned in the 5th Edition in 2019 after going through the public playtest process; this iteration of dragonmarks were incorporated mechanically as variant subraces of specific races. In February 2025, an &quot;Unearthed Arcana&quot; playtest included revised dragonmark mechanics which shifted them to feats with a progression option.

=== Creatures ===
Eberron utilized traditional &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; races but gave them entirely localized lore, history and national ties. Eberron emphasizes national and cultural ties over racial ties. Sean K. Reynolds wrote that &quot;for example, the elves of House Phiarlan are an old dragonmarked house with a centuries-long history of entertainment and artistry; most common folk praise them and their work. In contrast to that house, the elves of the new nation of Valenar are seen as land thieves and a threat to the peace established by the Treaty of Thronehold&quot;. Gabrielle Lissauer, in &quot;The Tropes of Fantasy Fiction&quot;, highlighted that the Eberron campaign setting subverts the classical racial presentation of orcs as savages. Instead, Lissauer wrote that &quot;these orcs are interested in peace and keeping the world safe. [...] They just want to live in harmony with nature&quot;.

The setting also added four new races to &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;: Changelings, Shifters, Kalashtar, and Warforged. Changelings and Shifters were based on preexisting &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; monsters, doppelgangers and lycanthropes respectively. Warforged, sentient constructs created by artificers during the Last War, and Kalashtar, psionic humanoids combined with quori spirits, were created for Eberron.

==== Kalashtar ====
The kalashtar are a race of psionic people; they are the descendants of a group of human monks from Adar, a nation on the continent of Sarlona, who allowed themselves to be possessed by the planar entities known as the Quori. These entities were good-aligned Quori who rebelled and thus had to flee the plane of dreams known as Dal Quor. This merger was permanent leading their descendants to become a hybrid-type race. The spiritual essence of each Quori is divided out amongst many Kalashtar, known collectively as a lineage. Thus, the only way to completely destroy one of the good-aligned Quori is to exterminate its entire lineage. The evil-aligned Quori, known as the Dreaming Dark, seek to hunt and destroy the Kalashtar so many Kalashtar live in either the fortified temple-keeps of Adar or live in hiding amongst the wider world of Eberron. The Dreaming Dark have their own possessed creatures known as the Inspired who rule most of the continent of Sarlona.

Baker highlighted the design differences between the Dreaming Dark and the kalashtar: &quot;Quori possession is entirely different from the relationship between a kalashtar and their quori spirit. With the kalashtar, the quori is a passive presence that simultaneously guides many kalashtar. With the Inspired (voluntary or otherwise) the quori is an active presence that controls a single body at a time, and it fully dominates the host&quot;. Glenn Carreau, for &quot;GameRant&quot;, highlighted the roleplaying potential of kalashtar player characters: &quot;While separate from most of Khorvaire&#x27;s drama, Sarlona has plenty of its own: kalashtar are a hunted race, shuttered into their monastic country of Adar and constantly besieged by their Inspired enemies in the neighboring nation of Riedra. Still, those who want to play kalashtar in a campaign based elsewhere in Eberron can do so without disrupting the setting&#x27;s narrative; small numbers of kalashtar &quot;do&quot; inhabit cities across Khorvaire, quietly continuing their battle against the Inspired even far from home&quot;.

==== Warforged ====

The warforged are a race of living, sentient constructs, superficially similar to golems. Warforged are composed of a blend of materials: predominantly stone, wood, and some type of metal. In Eberron, they were created by House Cannith in magical &#x27;creation forges&#x27; to fight in the Last War. When the Last War ended, they were given their freedom at the Treaty of Thronehold. Though they have free will, whether they have a soul is not known with certainty; they can be resurrected by spells designed to restore human souls to life, but, unlike humans, never remember anything of their experience in the afterlife after such an event. While they have no biological sex, warforged may adopt a gender role as part of their individual personality. They do not age as the other races do, and it is not known what effects time will have on them. It is generally assumed that, like all living creatures, their bodies must experience degradation over time. Like other races, warforged may take levels in any character class.

== Reception ==
Gabrielle Lissauer, in &quot;The Tropes of Fantasy Fiction&quot;, emphasized that Eberron helped move &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; past the tropes established by Tolkien. She wrote that &quot;Eberron changed several ideas that were considered fundamental to the concept of &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; for the past thirty years, both mechanically and in the flavor of the worlds. [...] With changes to things that most players considered being fundamental to the game, Eberron subverts and yet at the same time shows what the game could be&quot;. Lissauer highlighted that alignment was no longer clear cut and that the players were &quot;unable to use their meta-knowledge of years of playing &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; in other settings to judge who is friend and who is foe&quot;. Stefan Ekman, in the book &quot;Urban Fantasy: Exploring Modernity through Magic&quot;, argued that Eberron has the features of an urban fantasy. Ekman commented that a &quot;basic assumption&quot; of the setting &quot;is that magic has developed in a similar way to technology in our world and is now ubiquitous and commonplace&quot; and thus Eberron &quot;treats the supernatural (magic) in a modern and mundane, rather than an arcane, fashion. The world is also explicitly set up to mix the genres of fantasy, noir, and adventure stories in a post- (or inter-) bellum world reminiscent of the 1920s. When considered as fantasy, certain features stand out more clearly than others; when examined with an urban fantasy lens, other patterns emerge, suggesting different adventures for the players to engage in&quot;. He also noted Eberron &quot;makes use of the layering of cities to create underground spaces of the past&quot; and that &quot;these subterranean pasts provide spaces for the supernatural domain, for challenges and adventures, but they are also reflections of the present surface&quot;.

In 2015, &quot;Geek &amp; Sundry&quot; wrote: &quot;Winner of Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s Fantasy Setting Search contest in 2002, &quot;Eberron&quot; marries magic with steampunk&#x27;s technology, offering a world of elemental-powered airships, industrial nobility, and arcane tinkerers. [...] I dig the playable Warforged race, which puts you in the mind of a soldier drone seeking purpose (although their explicit maleness serves a pedantic point). If you want to sling spells in a tailored coat, check out &quot;Eberron&quot;&quot;.

&quot;Wired&quot;, on the release of the 4th Edition &quot;Eberron Campaign Guide&quot;, reported that &quot;Eberron is my new favorite game world. [...] The world feels like it was designed from the ground up to be original and different, and still feels consistent and logical. The world&#x27;s continents have an interlocking and compelling history [...]. Magic is treated as an integral part of society. You can take a magical train (the &#x27;lightning rail&#x27;) or fly elemental-powered airships. [...] I love the section on &#x27;everyday magic&#x27; which describes how magic affects the daily lives of the ordinary citizens, covering agriculture, communications, crafts, law enforcement and so on. [...] Most worlds have politics but I can&#x27;t think of any whose residents foment such complex, yet totally logical machinations. [...] The best thing bout the setting, however, may be that it simply takes the classic D&amp;D tropes like dragons and elves and mixes them up in a new and interesting way&quot;.

On the release of the 5th Edition &quot;Wayfinder&#x27;s Guide to Eberron&quot;, Richard Jansen-Parkes, for the UK print magazine &quot;Tabletop Gaming&quot;, wrote: &quot;Originally created by Gloom designer Keith Baker for a competition some 16 years ago, Eberron is a wonderful example of how to take the standard fantasy setting and twist it into something fresh. While many of the standard fantasy tropes are still accounted for – there are still dragons to battle and dungeons to delve – there is a deliberate effort to shift away from Tolkien rip-offs and instead start ripping off everything from Jurassic Park to Casablanca. If that sounds like a criticism, it really isn&#x27;t. [...] The entire setting is packed with magical gadgets and gizmos, but at the same time it manages to feel a little more down-to-earth and dirtier than the Forgotten Realms [...]. Where more traditional worlds have played host to battles between good and evil on a vast scale, Eberron is gripped in a cold war where there is very little black-and-white morality to spare&quot;.

&quot;Polygon&quot;, on the release of the 5th Edition &quot;&quot;, reported that &quot;Eberron is an amazing place, and Wizards of the Coast does an excellent job in this new book explaining it and giving players the tools to have fun there&quot;.

<text>The Nuttall Encyclopædia: Being a Concise and Comprehensive Dictionary of General Knowledge is a late 19th-century encyclopedia, edited by Rev. James Wood, first published in London in 1900 by Frederick Warne &amp; Co Ltd.

Editions were recorded for 1920, 1930, 1938 and 1956 and was still being sold in 1966. Editors included G. Elgie Christ and A. L. Hayden for 1930, Lawrence Hawkins Dawson for 1938 and C. M. Prior for 1956.

==Description==
&quot;The Nuttall Encyclopædia&quot; is named for Dr. Peter Austin Nuttall (d. 1869), whose works, such as &quot;Standard Pronouncing Dictionary of the English Language&quot; (published in 1863), were eventually acquired by Frederick Warne, and would be published for decades to come.

The title page proclaims this encyclopedia to be &quot;a concise and comprehensive dictionary of general knowledge consisting of over 16,000 terse and original articles on nearly all subjects discussed in larger encyclopædias, and specially dealing with such as come under the categories of history, biography, geography, literature, philosophy, religion, science, and art&quot;.

The entries or articles in this work are generally very short, and are mostly about individuals and places; while it has entries for fictional characters from Charles Dickens&#x27; books, the encyclopedia lacks entries for fruit. It often reflects the personal worldview of the author, viewing events from a definite perspective. This can be seen in entries like Dates of Epoch-Making Events. As another example, the entry for Venezuela presents a British view of an 1899 event:

In 2004, Project Gutenberg published a version of the 1907 edition, which is now in the public domain.

<text>The Taborites (, ), were a faction within the Hussite movement in the medieval Lands of the Bohemian Crown. The Taborites were sometimes referred to as the Picards, a term used for groups which were seen as extreme in their rejection of traditional Catholic practices and societal norms, for example advocation for communal living.

Although most of the Taborites were of rural origin, they played a major role in the town of Tábor. Taborite politics were also encroached upon by their priests. The most important Taborites included the governors Jan Žižka of Trocnov, Mikuláš of Hus, Bohuslav of Švamberk, Chval Řepický of Machovice, and Jan Roháč of Dubá, and the priest Prokop Holý. The main centre of their association was Tábor.

== Overview ==

The Taborites were centered in the Bohemian town of Tábor during the Hussite Wars in the 15th century. The religious reform movement in Bohemia splintered into various religious sects. Besides the Taborites, these included the Adamites, the Orebites, the Sirotci (&quot;Orphans&quot;), the Utraquists and the Praguers. Because the impetus for these movements came from the burning of Jan Hus, it has become common practice to label them all &quot;Hussites&quot;.

The Taborites&#x27; theology represented a departure from that of the medieval Catholic Church. They insisted on the normativeness of biblical authority. Even though Taborite theologians were versed in scholastic theology, they rejected scholastic methods.
== History ==
In the spring of 1420, a group of Hussites led by Petr Hromádka managed to seize the town of Sezimovo Ústí and the nearby Hradiště Castle in South Bohemia. They then began to build the model Hussite town &quot;Hradiště hory Tabor&quot;shortened to Tábornamed after Mount Tabor in Galilee. Social and economic equality was promoted in the town, and the Taborites addressed each other as brothers and sisters. Hussites flocked to Tábor from all over Bohemia. Economically supported by Tábor&#x27;s control of local gold mines, the citizens joined the local peasants in developing an intentionally communal living. Taborites announced the Millennium of Christ, and declared that there would be no more servants or masters, that all property would be held in common, and that there would be no more taxation. They promised that people would return to a state of pristine innocence. Some historians have found parallels to modern nationalist revolutionary movements. Additionally, Murray Bookchin argued that Tábor was an early example of anarcho-communism.

Hussites from Plzeň came to Tábor under the guidance of Břeňek Švihovský and Jan Žižka of . These Hussites were attacked by Catholic knights near Sudoměř on 25 March 1420. The repulsion of the knights encouraged the Hussites, and they managed to reach Tábor, which was still under construction. The Taborites chose four military commanders (Hetmans) from among themselves: Jan Žižka, Mikuláš of Hus, Chval Řepický of Machovice and Zbyněk z Buchov. Under their leadership, the Taborites made many sorties in South Bohemia, and at the end of May 1420, they headed towards Prague, threatened by Catholic armies during the first anti-Hussite crusade. In June, Tábor was unsuccessfully besieged by the troops of a South Bohemian noble, Oldřich II of Rosenberg. Cavalry led by the governor Mikuláš of Hus dispersed the siege. On 14 July near Prague, there was the Battle of Vítkov Hill in which Jan Žižka managed to thwart an attempt by Hungary and Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor to dominate the capital. The crusade then disintegrated without further struggle. In July, the Hussites negotiated about a possible future successor to the Czech throne. In response to the Four Articles of Prague, the Taborites published twelve revolutionary articles in Prague. However, the Praguers did not meet their demands and the troops left the city. 

At the end of August, Jan Žižka launched a large offensive against the estate of Oldřich of Rosenberg. The governor seized Prachatice, Vodňany and Lomnice. Young Oldřich was forced to conclude a ceasefire with Tábor until February 1421. Mikuláš of Pelhřimov was elected bishop of Tábor in September 1420. In December, Hetman Nicholas of Hus died as a result of a fall from a horse. The leader of the Taborites was now the governor Jan Žižka of Trocnov.


Jan Žižka commanded his rag-tag Bohemian army in defense against the crusading Imperial Army under Emperor Sigismund. Žižka did not believe that all prisoners should be slain and often showed clemency to those he defeated. After one battle, when his army disobeyed him and killed many prisoners, Žižka ordered the army to pray for forgiveness. That experience partly inspired him to write a famous military code of conduct, &quot;&quot; – a document partly inspired by the biblical book of Deuteronomy. Žižka eventually left Tabor because that community became too radical for his beliefs and took over the leadership of the more moderate Orebites in Hradec Králové. In response to the numerous attacks launched against Bohemia, the Taborites and Orebites often set aside their religious differences and cooperated militarily.


Once the external threat was removed by Hussite victories, the various Hussite factions turned on each other. At the beginning of 1421, the Adamites, who completely rejected the Eucharist, were expelled from Tábor. Under the leadership of priests Petr Kániš and Martin Húska, they settled in the Příběnice Castle, where the Adamites fell. Žižka suppressed their movement, and most sectarians, including both leaders, were then burnt as heretics under his orders. During the winter offensive in West Bohemia, the Taborites managed to seize Chomutov. The joint campaign of Taborites and Praguers into East Bohemia under Jan Žižka&#x27;s command was also successful and the towns Dvůr Králové, Polička and Vysoké Mýto fell into the Hussite hands. At the turn of 1421 and 1422, there was a battle, in which the blind governor managed to overwhelm King Sigismund of Luxembourg. At the end of April, the Lithuanian Grand Duke Vytautas arrived in Bohemia, where he was recognized (mostly by the Hussites and Taborites) as the country&#x27;s steward. In January 1423, Jan Žižka of Trocnov broke with the Tábor union and began to build Nový Tábor (New Tábor) in East Bohemia.

After Jan Žižka&#x27;s death on 11 October 1424, Jan Hvězda of Vícemilice and Bohuslav of Švamberk took the lead of the Taborite forces. The combined forces of Taborites, Sirotci and Praguers decisively defeated mercenaries from Saxony, Thuringia, Lusatia and Meissen in the Battle of Usti on 16 June 1426. Under the leadership of Prokop Holý, the combined troops of the Taborites and Sirotci defeated Albrecht II in the Battle of the Light. The Taborites in conjunction with the Sirotci and the Prague Union turned to flee from the Third and Fourth Crusades against the Hussites, in the battles of the Tachov and the Domažlice. In addition, led by Prokop Holý, they set out on campaigns abroad (German parts of the Holy Roman Empire, Austria, Upper and Lower Lusatia, Silesia, and Upper Hungary). In the spring of 1433, the council of Tábor at the Council of Basel was represented by Nicholas of Pelhřimov, who advocated the article on punishment of deadly sins. In the summer of 1433, the Taborites joined the siege of Catholic Plzeň. The city, however, defended well and Hussite troops were forced to abandon the ineffective siege. Finally, after twenty years, the power of the Taborites was broken with the Battle of Lipany on 30 May 1434, during which 13,000 of the 18,000-strong army of Taborites and Sirotci, led by Prokop Holý, were overwhelmingly defeated by the united Catholic forces. Under the weight of this defeat, the Sirotci&#x27;s union completely disappeared. Many of the leading Taborite commanders fell in battle, including the leading priest Prokop Holý.

After the Battle of Lipany, the opposition to King Sigismund and the agreement with the Council was led by governor Jan Roháč of Dubá. However, after the Taborites lost several of their castles and were defeated on 19 August 1435 by Oldřich of Rožmberk in the Battle of Křeč, the moderate wing, led by Bedřich of Strážnice, took over the Táborite faction. Jan Roháč and his faithful fortified at his castle Zion, which was soon conquered and all the surviving defenders were hanged in the Old Town Square of Prague. On 25 January 1437, by mutual agreement with Sigismund, Tábor was promoted to royal town and received the town&#x27;s coat of arms: an imperial eagle. On 8 February 1449, the remnants of the Taborite union were joined with the Catholic and Kališník nobility from South Bohemia, and so the so-called Strakonice Unity was established, which was directed against the ever-growing power of George of Poděbrady. On 1 September 1452, the town of Tábor was suddenly occupied by the army of the land administrator George of Poděbrady, and thus the independent political power of the Tábor union was ended.

<text>Lurleen Burns Wallace (born Lurleen Brigham Burns; September 19, 1926 – May 7, 1968) was an American politician who served as the 46th governor of Alabama for 16 months from January 16, 1967, until her death on May 7, 1968. She was the first wife of Alabama governor George Wallace, whom she succeeded as governor because at the time the Alabama constitution forbade consecutive terms. She was the first female Governor of Alabama. 

Wallace was Alabama&#x27;s first female governor and was the only woman to hold the governorship until Kay Ivey succeeded to the office in April 2017. Wallace is also (as of 2024) the only female governor in U.S. history to have died in office as well as being the first and only female Democrat to have served as governor in Alabama history. In 1973, she was posthumously inducted into the Alabama Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

==Early years==
Lurleen Brigham Burns was born to Henry Burns and the former Estelle Burroughs of Fosters in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, on September 19, 1926. She graduated in 1942 from Tuscaloosa County High School at the age of fifteen. She then worked at Kresge&#x27;s Five and Dime in Tuscaloosa, where she met George Wallace, at the time a member of the United States Army Air Corps. The couple married on May 22, 1943, when she was 16.

Over the next twenty years, George became well-known in Alabama politics for his segregationist views while Lurleen was a mother and a homemaker. The Wallaces had four children: Bobbi Jo Wallace Parsons (1944–2015), Peggy Sue Wallace Kennedy (born 1950), George III (born 1951), and Janie Lee Wallace Dye (born 1961). Due to George Wallace&#x27;s neglect of his family and frequent extramarital affairs, Lurleen filed for divorce in the late 1950s, later dropping the suit after he promised to be a better husband. 

When George was elected to his first of four nonconsecutive governor terms in 1963, Lurleen assumed the duties of First Lady of Alabama in 1963. She opened the first floor of the Alabama Governor&#x27;s Mansion to the public seven days a week. She refused to serve alcoholic beverages at official functions.

==1966 gubernatorial election campaign==

Like most southern U.S. states at the time, Alabama forbade governors from serving two consecutive terms, a provision incorporated in the Alabama Constitution of 1901 (term limit only maintained in Virginia as of 2024). During his first term, George Wallace attempted to lift the ban but was unsuccessful due to opposition in the Alabama Legislature, including from his political rival Ryan deGraffenried Sr. In order to retain power, he offered his wife as a surrogate candidate for governor (though George later succeeded and served three more terms, two of them consecutively).

Amid treatment for cancer, Lurleen Burns Wallace ran in the 1966 Alabama gubernatorial election as &quot;Mrs. George C. Wallace&quot; at the request of George, who wished to remain &quot;de facto&quot; governor. A similar strategy was used in 1924 by former Texas governor, James E. Ferguson, with his wife Miriam Wallace Ferguson. 

Shy in public and lacking interest in the workings of politics, Lurleen Wallace was described by an Alabama newspaper editor as the most &quot;unlikely candidate imaginable. It is as difficult to picture her in politics as to envision Helen Hayes butchering a hog.&quot; She herself said &quot;it never even crossed my mind that I&#x27;d ever enter politics...&quot;

=== Election field ===
The Democratic primary field included two former governors, John Malcolm Patterson and Jim Folsom, former congressman Carl Elliott of Jasper, and Attorney General Richmond Flowers, Sr. Lurleen won decisively with 54% and there was no runoff. 

She faced one-term Republican U.S. representative James D. Martin in the general election. Though there had not been a Republican governor of Alabama since 1874, Martin&#x27;s run was promising and he was expected to win by some political commentators. Martin campaigned with US senator Strom Thurmond and 1964 presidential nominee Barry Goldwater, focusing on the unpopular Vietnam War, inflation, and urban unrest occurring nationally under Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson as well as challenging state issues such as George Wallace handling road and school construction with &quot;secret deals&quot;, issuing an expensive contract to a friend, and forging &quot;conspiracies between the state house and the White House.&quot; Martin bemoaned having to campaign against a woman and proclaimed that Wallace was a &quot;proxy&quot; candidate, a manifestation of her husband&#x27;s &quot;insatiable appetite for power.&quot; 

At her general election campaign kickoff in Birmingham, Lurleen Wallace pledged &quot;progress without compromise&quot; and &quot;accomplishment without surrender ... George will continue to speak up and stand up for Alabama.&quot; She used the slogan &quot;Two Governors, One Cause&quot; and proclaimed the words &quot;Alabama&quot; and &quot;freedom&quot; to be synonyms. It was during this 1966 campaign that George Wallace coined his famous line: &quot;There&#x27;s not a dime&#x27;s worth of difference&quot; between the two national parties.&quot; George Wallace&#x27;s organization proved insurmountable despite an early poll that placed Martin within range of victory. Wallace had strong support for stemming from his firm opposition to desegregation. Neither candidate sought support from African American voters, many of whom had been registered in the previous year due to the Voting Rights Act.

Lurleen Wallace won with 537,505 votes (63.4 percent). Martin trailed with 262,943 votes (31 percent). A third candidate running to the political left of the major candidates, Dr. Carl Robinson, received 47,655 (5.6 percent). Wallace won every Alabama county besides Greene (which she lost by six votes), and Winston, a predominately Republican county in the North. 

==Illness and governorship ==
Lurleen was diagnosed with cancer early as April 1961, when her surgeon biopsied suspicious tissue that he noticed during the cesarean delivery of her last child. As was common at the time, the physician did not tell the news to Lurleen but to her husband, who insisted she remain unaware, and failed to seek appropriate care for her. When she saw a gynecologist for abnormal bleeding in 1965, her diagnosis of uterine cancer came as a complete shock. Lurleen was outraged to learn from one of her husband&#x27;s aides that the staffers had known of her cancer since George&#x27;s 1962 campaign three years earlier. 

Lurleen Wallace cooperated with a campaign of dissimulation and misdirection as she underwent radiation therapy in December 1965 and a hysterectomy in January 1966. Since Alabama then lacked adequate cancer treatment facilities, Wallace traveled to the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston for treatment. Despite her ill health, Wallace maintained an arduous campaign schedule throughout 1966 until she won the election. At the January 1967 inauguration, she gave a 24-minute speech, her longest ever, and stated that her husband would be her &quot;number one assistant&quot;.

Early in her term, Wallace&#x27;s condition began to deteriorate. In June 1967, doctors found an abdominal growth which a July 10 surgery revealed to be an egg-sized malignancy on her colon. She began a second course of radiation therapy. Wallace&#x27;s most notable independent action as governor was increasing appropriations for the Bryce Hospital and the Partlow State School, a residential institution for the developmentally disabled. She visited both institutions in Tuscaloosa on her own initiative in February 1967 after reading a news story about overcrowding and poor staffing, and was horrified by the filthy, barracks-like settings. She also obtained a large funding increase for Alabama state parks.

== Death ==
In January 1968, after extensive testing, Lurleen informed her staff (but not the public) that she had a cancerous pelvic tumor which was pressing on the nerves of her back down through her right hip. Her last public appearances as governor were at the 1967 Blue–Gray Football Classic on December 30 and a January 11 campaign appearance for George&#x27;s presidential bid on the American Party ticket. The pelvic tumor was removed in late February. This was followed by surgery to treat an abdominal abscess, and in late March 1968, more surgery to dissolve a blood clot in her left lung. By April, the cancer was in her liver and lungs, and she weighed less than eighty pounds.

George Wallace continued to make campaign stops nationwide during her last weeks of life and persistently lied to the press about her condition, claiming in April 1968 that &quot;she has won the fight&quot; against cancer. On May 5, the day he was to leave for a Michigan appearance, doctors warned him that Lurleen&#x27;s condition was unstable. She was too ill to be moved back to the hospital, and at her request, George cancelled a May 6 television appearance. She died in Montgomery, Alabama, at 12:34 A.M. May 7, 1968, at home with her husband beside her and the rest of her family, including her parents, just outside her room, and the couple&#x27;s three youngest children in the next room near it. She was 41 years old.
Wallace lay in state in the Capitol building on May 8, and 21,000 mourners waited as long as five hours to view her silver casket. Despite her emphatic request for a closed casket, George insisted that her body be on view, with a glass bubble over the open part of the coffin. The day of her funeral, May 9, all public and private schools closed except for the Anniston Academy, all state offices closed, and most businesses closed or had abbreviated hours. She was interred at Greenwood Cemetery in Montgomery. 

At the time of her funeral, George Wallace had left the governor&#x27;s mansion and moved into a Montgomery home they had purchased in 1967. He did not take his children with him, instead sending the siblings, ages 18, 16, and 6, to live with family and friends. The Wallaces’ eldest daughter had married and left home. George Wallace had two subsequent marriages to the former Cornelia Ellis Snively and Lisa Taylor, both of which ended in divorce.

Governor Lurleen Wallace was succeeded by Lieutenant Governor Albert Brewer, a one-time ally of her husband who retained the office in the 1970 election, with support from President Richard Nixon. George Wallace returned as governor in January 1971, where he remained for two consecutive terms and then returned for a fourth and final term from 1983 to 1987.

==Legacies==
In honor of her support for parks, Lake Lurleen and Lurleen B. Wallace Boulevard, both in her native Tuscaloosa County, are named in her memory.

Following Lurleen&#x27;s death, her successor, Governor Albert Brewer, spearheaded the Lurleen Wallace Courage Crusade to fund and build a new cancer center in Alabama. The University of Alabama Hospital at the University of Alabama at Birmingham was selected as the site for the cancer center, and a formal cancer center program was begun in 1970. Funding was received from the National Cancer Institute, and the center became one of the first eight NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers. Dr. John Durant served as its first director. Construction of the Lurleen B. Wallace Tumor Institute at the University of Alabama began in 1974 and was completed in 1975, seven years after the death by cancer of Gov. Wallace. It (the Tumor Institute) was then renovated, with the renovation project completing in 2013. The Wallace Patient Tower, an addition to University Hospital, was built in her honor, as was Lurleen B. Wallace Community College in Andalusia, Alabama; and Lurleen B. Wallace Hall on the campus of the University of West Alabama.

Artist Nina Simone sang that &quot;Lurleen Wallace has made me lose my rest&quot; in several live performances of her 1964 civil rights song, &quot;Mississippi Goddam&quot;.

<text>John Stephen Monagan (December 23, 1911 – October 23, 2005) was a Connecticut politician, lawyer, and author.

Monagan graduated from Dartmouth College in 1933, where he majored in French literature and was the editor of the &quot;Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern&quot;. He was a Brother of the Dartmouth Chapter of the Alpha Delta Phi. After attending Harvard University law school, he served on the Board of Aldermen in Waterbury, Connecticut and became Mayor of Waterbury in 1943, serving until 1948.

In 1958, he was elected Congressman from a district including Waterbury and served in the House of Representatives from 1959 until 1973, leaving after being defeated for re-election in 1972. After leaving Congress, Monagan practiced as a lawyer in Washington, D.C., and was active in amateur music and in charitable causes. Monagan wrote several books including his memoirs and a biography of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., titled &quot;The Grand Panjandrum: Mellow Years of Justice Holmes&quot; (1988).

He also maintained a decades-long correspondence with the British novelist Anthony Powell. He died in October 2005 after a long illness, at the age of 93. He continued to be active into his nineties as a writer and book reviewer; a month before his death, he spoke at a symposium honoring Anthony Powell&#x27;s centenary at Georgetown University.

His son-in-law was playwright and theater performer Trav S.D., who was married to his daughter Susan.

<text>William Gladstone Stewart (15 July 1933 – 21 September 2017) was an English television producer, director, and television presenter, best known as the presenter and producer of the Channel 4 quiz show &quot;Fifteen to One&quot; from 1988 to 2003.

==Early life==
Stewart was born on 15 July 1933 in Lancaster. He was orphaned as a child before the age of three, and he was raised in a children&#x27;s home in Sidcup, Kent until the age of 17. After leaving Shooters Hill Grammar School (now called Shooters Hill Sixth Form College) in 1950, Stewart was employed in jobs working in an office and enrolled at Woolwich Polytechnic. He undertook his National Service in Kenya and worked as a teacher in the Royal Army Educational Corps from 1952 to 1955 as part of his attachment to the King&#x27;s African Rifles.

In 1958, Stewart ventured to Southampton to join the Merchant Navy, though an industrial action prevented him from doing so. Instead, he applied to be a redcoat with the seaside resort chain Butlins at Butlin&#x27;s Pwllheli in North Wales. Stewart said of the opportunity, &quot;I thought I&#x27;d have a great time and perhaps work in the kitchens. But, while I was having an interview, a chap asked if I wanted to be a redcoat. He must have seen something in me.&quot; There, he organised a talent contest won by Jimmy Tarbuck and led the teenager to become a redcoat and a stand-up comedian.

==Broadcasting career==
Stewart went to a talk organised by the producer T Lesley Jackson about a career in television at the YMCA in Brixton in south-west London in 1958. It encouraged him to speak to Jackson and apply for the job of a call-boy for the BBC&#x27;s Light Entertainment output. He later became an assistant floor manager and a stage manager, before ending up as a production assistant. After the 1959 general election, Stewart began working as private secretary to Tom Driberg, the Labour Member of Parliament. Driberg taught Stewart about art, classical music and literature, and broadened his social circle.

He was encouraged by the comedian Eric Sykes to enrol on a television director&#x27;s course in 1965. Stewart was advised his best career path would be to remain in the entertainment industry, and Sykes recommended Stewart to his fellow light entertainment comedian Frank Muir. The same year, he directed episodes of the sitcoms &quot;Call It What You Like&quot; and &quot;Sykes and a...&quot; Stewart moved to the rival broadcaster ITV in 1967, working for the Associated Television, London Weekend Television and Thames Television franchises. He was a director on 54 episodes of the &quot;The Frost Programme,&quot; and &quot;The Frost Report&quot; for Associated-Rediffusion.

Among the many shows he produced or directed were &quot;Father, Dear Father&quot;, &quot;Love Thy Neighbour&quot;, &quot;Bless This House&quot;, &quot;My Good Woman&quot;, &quot;Spooner&#x27;s Patch&quot;, &quot;The Rag Trade&quot;, &quot;Family Fortunes&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget Your Toothbrush,&quot; &quot;Thirty Minutes Worth&quot;, &quot;My Name Is Harry Worth&quot;, &quot;The Reg Varney Show&quot;, &quot;The Many Wives of Patrick&quot;, and &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;. He also presented the short-lived 1992 quiz show &quot;Famous People, Famous Places&quot;, made by his company, Regent Productions (which also produced &quot;Fifteen to One&quot;) that he founded in 1982, for Thames Television and shown only in the London region. He later sold Regent to Pearson Television (which also purchased Thames) in 1999, and they have now been amalgamated (along with the likes of Grundy Productions) into Talkback Thames, the UK arm of FremantleMedia.

In 1998, he successfully sued the &quot;Fifteen to One&quot; contestant Trevor Montague, who had lied to reappear on the programme. He made a documentary of Tom Driberg in 2009. Stewart was a frequent contributor of media matters articles to the &quot;Broadcast&quot;, &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, &quot;Impact&quot;, &quot;RTS Journal&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;The Listener&quot;, &quot;The Producer&quot; and &quot;Televisual&quot; publications. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Television Society in 1996 and was president of The Media Society from 2003 to 2005.

==Personal life==
He was thrice married:
#Audrey Harrison (1960–1976) with whom he had one son, Nick.
#Actress Sally Geeson (1976–1986) with whom he had one daughter, Hayley, and one son, Barnaby.
#Laura Calland (1997–2017) with whom he had two daughters, Isobel and Hannah. Calland was the voice-over artist for &quot;Fifteen to One.&quot;

He was a long-standing supporter of the campaign to return the Elgin Marbles to Greece. He joked that if, on an episode of &quot;Fifteen to One&quot;, too few contestants survived the first round to continue the game, he would give a speech on the Marbles to fill the time. This happened in a 2001 episode, where he gave a lengthy presentation stating the case to return them, for which the channel was criticised.

He died on 21 September 2017 at the age of 84. At the time of his death, his birthplace was reported as being the Lincolnshire village of Habrough.

<text>Phylace or Phylake (, [ˌfyˈlaˌkɛː]), was a town and polis (city-state) of Phthiotis in ancient Thessaly. According to Greek mythology, this city was founded by Phylacus. In Ancient Greece, Phylace was a kingdom. Homer writes that this was one of the places subject to Protesilaus, who was the first Greek hero killed in the Trojan War, and the place is frequently mentioned in the Homeric poems. It contained a temple of Protesilaus. Pliny erroneously calls it a town of Magnesia. Strabo describes it as standing between Pharsalus and Phthiotic Thebes, at the distance of about 100 stadia from the latter. 

The site of ancient Phylace has traditionally been identified with a low hill at Kitiki (renamed Filaki), in the municipal unit of Filaki. As no inscriptions have been found at this location confirming the identification, it must be regarded as tentative. An other candidate is the hill of Dervisi close to Aerino (formerly Persoufli).

<text>Albert Preston Brewer (October 26, 1928 – January 2, 2017) was an American lawyer and Democratic Party politician who served as the 47th governor of Alabama from 1968 to 1971. He previously served as the lieutenant governor of Alabama, the speaker of the Alabama House of Representatives, and as an Alabama state representative representing Morgan County from 1955 to 1967.

==Early life==

Albert Preston Brewer was born on October 26, 1928, in Bethel Springs, Tennessee, United States, to Daniel A. Brewer, a farmer, and Clara Albert Brewer. While Albert was a child, the family moved to Decatur so his father could take a job with the Tennessee Valley Authority. Brewer stayed there and attended Lafayette Street School, Decatur Jr. High School, and Decatur High School, until he left for the University of Alabama in 1946 to study history and political science. He earned his law degree from the University of Alabama School of Law in 1952 and returned to Decatur to practice law. From 1956 to 1963 he served as Chairman of the Decatur Planning Commission, and in 1963 he was selected as Decatur&#x27;s “Outstanding Young Man of the Year” and was selected by the Alabama Junior Chamber of Commerce as one of the four “Outstanding Young Men in Alabama.”

Brewer married Martha Helen Farmer in 1950 and had two children, Rebecca Anne and Beverly Allison. He was a Baptist.

==Legislative career==

=== House of Representatives ===
In 1953, Brewer chaired the &quot;Young Democrats&quot; chapter for Alabama&#x27;s 8th congressional district. In 1954, the incumbent legislator serving Morgan County in the Alabama House of Representatives announced his retirement. Local community leaders recruited Brewer to run. He won the Democratic primary and, facing no opposition in the general election, was seated the following year. He was reelected in 1958 and 1962.

With the support of Governor-elect George Wallace, he was elected Speaker at the opening of the 1963 legislative session on January 8 without opposition. The speakership also made him &quot;ex officio&quot; chairman of the House Rules Committee. Under Brewer&#x27;s leadership, the House was generally supportive of Wallace&#x27;s goals. During the session, a bill to increase education spending, coupled with new tax increases, was introduced and passed through the legislature. Brewer, wary of Wallace&#x27;s campaign promises to block tax increases, met with the governor to ask when he would veto the bill and send it back to the legislature. Wallace stated that he did not intend to veto the bill to preserve his campaign pledge, instead saying that he would &quot;just yell nigger&quot; to avoid scrutiny. After this, Brewer began to have doubts about Wallace&#x27;s merits.

In 1964, Brewer and the future U.S. Senator James B. Allen, then the lieutenant governor, were among the unpledged presidential electors on the Alabama ballot. They lost to the Republican slate committed to Barry M. Goldwater. No electors pledged to U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson were permitted on the Alabama ballot. While national Democrats balked over Johnson&#x27;s exclusion, most supported the unpledged slate, which competed directly with the Republican electors. As &quot;The Tuscaloosa News&quot; explained, loyalist electors would have offered a clearer choice to voters than did the unpledged slate.

=== Lieutenant governor ===
In 1966 Brewer considered running for the office of governor, as incumbent Governor George Wallace was constitutionally restricted from seeking another term. The governor&#x27;s wife, Lurleen Wallace, entered the race and Brewer, convinced a gubernatorial candidacy would be futile, decided to run for the office of lieutenant governor of Alabama. With a coalition of Wallace supporters, organized labor, and urbanites, he overwhelmingly defeated his opponent in the Democratic primary and faced no opposition in the general election. He was sworn in on January 16, 1967. Lurleen Wallace also won and was inaugurated that month. As lieutenant governor, he convinced the legislature to create an Education Study Commission.

In early July 1967 Lurleen Wallace traveled to Texas for cancer treatment. State law stipulated that if the governor was out of state for 21 days, the lieutenant governor officially assumed their responsibilities as acting governor. This went into effect at the beginning of July 24, and Brewer served as acting governor for about 15 hours, meeting with some state officials, signing extradition papers, and appointing 25 honorary colonels, before Wallace was flown back to Alabama.

== Governor ==
=== Executive action ===

Though aware of Lurleen Wallace&#x27;s affliction with cancer, Brewer was not familiar with the severity of her condition until shortly before she died. Wallace succumbed on May 7, 1968, and, as stipulated in the constitution, Brewer succeeded to the office of governor. Taking the oath before only his family and George Wallace, Brewer remained very guarded about his feelings and views early in his new tenure, and delayed moving into the governor&#x27;s mansion until Wallace had found a new home for his family. Wallace&#x27;s erstwhile legal counsel, Cecil Jackson, directed all executive cabinet members to offer their resignations to Brewer to allow him to build a team of his choosing. Brewer ended up retaining most of the cabinet, though he fired the public safety director and the director of the Department of Conservation after they refused to offer their resignations (and after the latter became involved in a physical altercation with another state employee).

Fairly soon after taking office, Brewer and his new state finance director, Bob Ingram, uncovered the large extent to which the Wallace administration had favored supporters in conducting state business, including alleged kickbacks for road construction contracts and asking state troopers to funnel stranded motorists to preferred tow truck services. Brewer was personally bothered by these improprieties but, wanting to seek election to his own gubernatorial term in 1970, felt it would be unwise to anger Wallace supporters by publicly exposing and denouncing these practices. As part of their attempt to quietly reform the executive branch, Brewer and Ingram tapped experienced public servants who they viewed as ethical, such as Tom Brassell, who was made assistant finance director. Despite this commitment to reform, he sometimes intervened in hiring and other state business to assist friends and dole out favors. On the whole, politicization in Brewer&#x27;s administration was more muted than his predecessors&#x27;, and civil servant morale improved during his tenure.

Unlike his two predecessors, Brewer held weekly press conferences. At one such meeting in June 1968, Brewer called for the establishment of a state motor pool, saying he would create one by executive order and then ask for the legislature to affirm it. The motor pool system, which he hoped would limit inappropriate use of state vehicles for personal purposes, required all vehicles to be checked out and all fuel to be purchased from the state. He also had state insignia prominently affixed to all motor pool vehicles to increase their visibility as government property. All vehicles deemed unnecessary—totaling about 1,000—were requisitioned from various agencies and listed for sale, including the governor&#x27;s limousine. In the end, the reforms only generated minor cost savings for the government. He also had excess copy machines sold, consolidated the state&#x27;s computer systems, eliminated 12 senior assistant positions, and dispatched various staff the Wallaces&#x27; had loaned to the governor&#x27;s office back to their agencies of origin to handle their official competencies.

George Wallace was critical of some of the reforms, particularly the motor pool, complaining that they reflected a &quot;de facto&quot; rebuke of his late wife. While originally cautious about besmirching the Wallaces, the complaints annoyed Brewer and led him to abandon his earlier concerns. The governor also initiated an investigation into commissions collections by agents of the Alcohol Beverage Control Board. While the practice had been &quot;de jure&quot; eliminated by law in 1963 supported by both Wallace and Brewer, many board agents were purportedly collecting commissions on distillery sales without authorization during the Wallaces&#x27; tenures. George Wallace denied any knowledge of the impropriety and Brewer affirmed his innocence, but Wallace still criticized Brewer for the publicity the scandal received.

Brewer also took actions in accordance with his own socially conservative views which were popular among most Alabamians. After being informed by his wife that pornographic movies were being displayed in Bessemer, he authorized a series of state raids on theatres. He also initiated crackdowns on alcohol and narcotics abuse. Following a series of influence peddling scandals in the legislature, Brewer issued an executive order creating an ethics commission tasked with drafting a code of ethics for potential adoption by the legislature. Among his suggested points were the prohibition of gifts for officials, a ban on officials working for and receiving compensation from entities they regulated, and establishing conflict of interest disclosure rules. He offered funds from his office budget to support the commission&#x27;s work.

To promote economic development, Brewer pursued industrial recruitment, traveling to New York to speak with corporate executives and hosting various in-person meetings with company representatives. He created the Alabama Program Development Office to link federal grant applications with local government&#x27;s development efforts. Following a series of major fish kills on state rivers caused by dumping of chemicals, Brewer encouraged the state to take action against Geigy Chemical Company and create new anti-pollution laws.

=== Legislative action ===
In legislative and policy disputes, Brewer preferred negotiation and finding common ground rather than public spats or power plays with patronage, as George Wallace had. In anticipation of the first legislative session being convened while he was governor, he decided to focus on improving education, consolidating bureaucratic procedures, trimming unnecessary spending, and improving Alabama&#x27;s national image. He investigated the state of education in Alabama, and found that overall the system was not improving relative to other states, despite efforts at reform during the Wallace administrations. He informed state education officials that he wanted to alter the state&#x27;s strategy for responding to federal school desegregation orders; in contrast to Wallace&#x27;s flagrant hostility and refusals, Brewer would &quot;try to do it in a way that will let us do the most palatable thing for the people, the patrons of our system.&quot;

Brewer believed that a school choice policy which permitted integrated schooling options could satisfy the federal government&#x27;s demands and be accepted by most Alabamians, thus preserving popular support for his goal of improving the public education system. Many school choice proponents in the South had advocated for choice policies to deliberately stall integration and preserve segregated schools, and by that point many federal courts were dissatisfied with such proposals. Several weeks after Brewer communicated to President Lyndon B. Johnson that he would engage the federal government in good faith on school segregation issues, the United States Attorney General sued in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama to replace school choice options. After the court ordered new measures be taken to further integration, Johnson ordered the schools integrate their faculty at a specific ratio and directed that some black schools be closed. The governor responded by engaging in similar rhetoric as segregationist, complaining of bureaucratic interference and social engineering. He also warned that under a more directed desegregation plan, most white parents would simply enroll their children in private schools. Despite this, he pledged to respect any court orders on racial matters. His request that Johnson reconsider his order was rejected.

Meanwhile, the Education Study Commission released a report on education in Alabama which outlined numerous deficiencies including overcrowded schools, inadequate instructional materials, underqualified educators, and uncompetitive pay rates for teachers. The commission recommended that additional funding was needed to improve the situation. In 1969 he called the legislature into special session to consider 30 bills aimed at improving education. Despite resistance from some urban legislators who thought the package did more to improve rural areas, the proposals were passed, increasing education spending by $132 million, raising teacher salaries by over 20 percent over two years, making the state and local superintendent positions appointive, granting the Education Study Commission statutory status, and creating the Alabama Commission on Higher Education.

At the beginning of the 1969 session, Brewer announced that he would push for new pollution control laws. With industrial groups heavily lobbying the legislature, only a weak bill was passed. More focused on education reform, Brewer decided against pushing for stronger regulations in a matter which would anger corporate interests and, in his view, earn him few additional votes in the 1970 election. More fish kills and serious mercury pollution in 1970 led for Brewer to appeal for federal assistance a commission a water quality survey and, as a lame duck, he briefly considered convening a special session to address inadequate pollution controls before ruling it unfeasible. His efforts during the 1969 session to strengthen consumer credit protections or schedule the legislature for annual sessions (instead of biannual) also failed. Despite this, Brewer&#x27;s administration was able to obtain funding for a state Medicaid program, a state employee pay hike, new highway safety legislation, two anti-pornography measures, a meat inspection law, and a requirement that all workers contracted by the state for construction be guaranteed standard wages.

=== 1970 gubernatorial campaign ===
Brewer supported Wallace&#x27;s 1968 presidential campaign, soliciting donations and delivering speeches on his behalf. Within months of Brewer assuming office, Wallace assured him privately and stated publicly that he would not seek the governor&#x27;s office in 1970. Around the Thanksgiving holiday in 1968, Wallace confronted Brewer about the alcohol agents scandal, and told Brewer in a meeting at the governor&#x27;s mansion, &quot;If you keep talking about it, it&#x27;s going to reflect on me and I may just have to run against you in 1970.&quot; Brewer countered, &quot;[Y]ou never have had a better friend than I&#x27;ve been to you and [your wife], and you told me [so] yourself when she died.&quot; The two spoke infrequently after the meeting, and Brewer continued with his preparations to be elected as governor in his own right in 1970, and, mindful of the possibility of another Wallace candidacy, took increasingly bolder policy positions and actions.

In that effort, he gained an important ally in U.S. President Richard M. Nixon, who had defeated Wallace in the 1968 presidential election and sought to neutralize Wallace as a potential adversary in 1972. Brewer&#x27;s 1970 gubernatorial campaign, however, was revolutionary in many respects. Although earlier in his political career he was regarded as a segregationist but not a race-baiter, Brewer refused to engage in racist rhetoric and courted newly registered black voters. He hoped to build a coalition of black people, educated middle-class whites, and working-class whites from northern Alabama, traditionally a more liberal part of the state. He unveiled a platform calling for more funding for education, an ethics commission and a commission to revise Alabama&#x27;s 1901 state constitution, which had been deliberately framed to disenfranchise black people and poor whites.

Brewer led Wallace in the Democratic primary but failed to win an outright majority. He then faced Wallace in a runoff. Wallace, whose presidential ambitions would have been destroyed with a defeat, ran a very aggressive and dirty campaign using racist rhetoric while proposing few ideas of his own. The Wallace campaign aired TV ads with slogans such as &quot;Do you want the black block electing your governor?&quot; and circulated an ad showing a white girl surrounded by seven black boys, with the slogan &quot;Wake Up Alabama! Blacks vow to take over Alabama.&quot; Wallace called Brewer a sissy and promised not to run for president a third time. Wallace narrowly won the Democratic runoff with 51.6 percent of the vote to Brewer&#x27;s 48.4% and won the general election by a wide margin. He was succeeded by Wallace on January 18, 1971, after 987 days in office.

==Later life==

After leaving office in January 1971, Brewer joined a law firm in Montgomery. He considered challenging Wallace again in the 1974 gubernatorial election, hoping that the salience of racial politics would decline by that point, but decided against it as Wallace&#x27;s popularity persisted unabated after the 1972 assassination attempt on Wallace by Arthur Bremer. Instead, Brewer ran for governor again in 1978, but lost the Democratic primary, missing the runoff by almost 2 percentage points. When Wallace ran again in 1982, Brewer endorsed Republican Emory Folmar in the general election. In 1987 he became a professor of law and government at Samford University&#x27;s Cumberland School of Law. Before his death, he taught a course on Professional Responsibility at the Cumberland School of Law. He was also an active leader with the Alabama Citizens for Constitutional Reform since 2000.

On January 2, 2017, Brewer died in Jackson Hospital, Montgomery, Alabama, at 88.

== Legacy ==
Albert P. Brewer High School in eastern Morgan County is named in honor of Brewer. The school opened in 1972.

Historian Gordon E. Harvey wrote, &quot;Brewer did more to improve education in Alabama than most of his predecessors and all but a few of his successors.&quot;

<doc id="677813" wikidata="Q1138091" url="?curid=677813" title="Nightfall (Asimov novelette and novel)">
<text>&quot;Nightfall&quot; is a 1941 science fiction short story by the American writer Isaac Asimov about the coming of darkness to the people of a planet ordinarily illuminated by sunlight at all times. It was adapted into a novel with Robert Silverberg in 1990. The short story has appeared in many anthologies and six collections of Asimov stories. In 1968, the Science Fiction Writers of America voted &quot;Nightfall&quot; the best science fiction short story written prior to the 1965 establishment of the Nebula Awards and included it in &quot;The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume One, 1929–1964&quot;.

==Background==
Written from March 17 to April 9, 1941 and sold on April 24, the short story was published in the September 1941 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; under editor John W. Campbell. It was the 32nd story by Asimov, written while he was a graduate student in chemistry at Columbia University. Campbell asked Asimov to write the story after discussing with him a quotation from Ralph Waldo Emerson:

Campbell&#x27;s opinion was to the contrary: &quot;I think men would go mad&quot;. He and Asimov chose the title together.

Campbell bought the story at a bonus rate of cents per word and at more than 13,000 words, &quot;Nightfall&quot; was Asimov&#x27;s longest story yet. Consequently, Asimov received US$166 ($ in present-day dollars), more than twice any previous payment for a story. He later said that before &quot;Nightfall&quot; neither he nor anyone else other than perhaps Campbell considered him more than a &quot;third rater&quot;; his name appeared on the cover of &quot;Astounding&quot; for the first time, and the story made him one of the field&#x27;s top writers. Asimov believed that the unusual plot of &quot;Nightfall&quot; distinguished it from others, but &quot;The Last Question&quot; was his own favorite story.

In 1988, Martin H. Greenberg suggested Asimov find someone who would take his 47-year-old short story and — keeping the story essentially as written — add a detailed beginning and a detailed ending to it. This resulted in the 1990 publication of the novel &quot;Nightfall&quot; by Isaac Asimov and Robert Silverberg. As Asimov relates in the Robert Silverberg chapter of his autobiography, &quot;Eventually, I received the extended &quot;Nightfall&quot; manuscript from Bob [Silverberg] ... Bob did a wonderful job and I could almost believe I had written the whole thing myself. He remained absolutely faithful to the original story[,] and I had very little to argue with.&quot;

The planet Lagash (&quot;Kalgash&quot; in the novel) is constantly illuminated by the six suns of its multiple-star system. Areas of darkness exist in enclosed areas on Lagash, such as caves, tunnels, and windowless rooms, but night never falls, because at least one sun is present in the sky at any given time.

A skeptical journalist visits a university observatory to interview a group of scientists who warn that civilization on Lagash will soon end. The researchers explain that they have discovered evidence of numerous ancient civilizations on the planet, all destroyed by fire, with the collapses occurring about 2,000 years apart. Furthermore, the religious writings of a doomsday cult claim that Lagash periodically passes through an enormous cave where mysterious &quot;stars&quot; appear. The stars are said to rain down fire from the heavens and rob people of their souls, reducing them to beast-like savages.

The scientists use this apparent myth, along with recent discoveries in gravitational research, to develop a theory about the repeated collapse of society. A mathematical analysis of Lagash&#x27;s orbit around its primary sun reveals irregularities caused by the presence of a previously undiscovered moon that cannot be seen in the light of day. Calculations indicate that this &quot;invisible&quot; moon will soon obscure one of Lagash&#x27;s suns when it is alone in the sky, resulting in a total eclipse that recurs every 2,049 years. Having evolved on a planet with no diurnal cycle, all Lagashians possess an intense, instinctive fear of the dark. Psychological experiments involving darkness have revealed that Lagashians may suffer permanent mental illness or even death after as little as 15 minutes of exposure and the eclipse is projected to last for over half a day. This, coupled with the diameter of the umbra being at least as great as that of the planet, ensures that the entire world population will experience an unprecedented period of prolonged, widespread darkness.

The scientists theorize that earlier civilizations on Lagash were destroyed by people who went insane during previous eclipses and, desperate for any light source, started large fires that destroyed cities. Oral accounts of the resulting chaos from crazed survivors and their children were passed down through the ages and formed the basis for the doomsday cult&#x27;s sacred texts. Present-day civilization is doomed for the same reasons, but the researchers hope that saving a few hundred sane people in a hideout lit by newly invented torches and conducting detailed observations of the upcoming eclipse will help to break the cycle of societal collapse.

The scientists are unprepared for the stars. Because of the perpetual daylight on Lagash, its inhabitants are unaware of the existence of stars apart from their own; Lagashian astronomers estimate that the entire universe is no more than a few light-years in diameter and may hypothetically contain a small number of other suns. However, Lagash is located in the center of a giant cluster and, during the eclipse, the night sky, the first that any living person on Lagash has ever seen, is filled with the dazzling light of more than 30,000 newly visible stars.

Learning that the universe is far vaster and Lagash far more insignificant than they believed, coupled with the worldwide darkness produced by the eclipse, drives everyone, including the scientists, insane. Outside the observatory, in the direction of the city, the horizon begins glowing with the light of spreading fires as &quot;the long night&quot; returns to Lagash.

==Setting and novel==
The system of Lagash has six stars named Alpha, Beta, etc., in the original short story, whereas each has a proper name in the novel.

In the novel, Onos is the primary sun of Lagash and is located 10 light-minutes away, similar to the distance from Earth to the Sun. The other five suns are minor in comparison, but provide enough light to prevent the inhabitants of Lagash from defining &quot;night&quot;. The only other distance given is that Tano and Sitha form a binary star system about 11 times as far away as Onos.

* Onos — yellow dwarf, similar to the Sun
* Dovim — red dwarf
* Trey and Patru — class A or F main sequence stars, described as &quot;white&quot;, a binary star system
* Tano and Sitha — class A, B, or O main sequence stars, described as &quot;blue&quot;, a binary star system

From what can be drawn from the text, Onos, the star appearing brightest and largest in Lagash&#x27;s sky, is the star that Lagash orbits. Onos, in turn, orbits around the binary system Trey and Patru, the other binary system Tano and Sitha, and the red dwarf star Dovim. In addition to these stars, the only other celestial object mentioned is Lagash&#x27;s moon, dubbed Lagash Two by the scientists of Lagash. Lagash Two follows an eccentric orbit around Lagash and every 2049 years it eclipses Dovim, during a period when from one part of Lagash, Dovim is the only star that would be visible.

The characters of the novel travel to three separate locations on Lagash. Most of the book is set in Saro City, which is situated near a large forest with trees, bushes, and graben (scavenger animals). As stated in the book&#x27;s introduction, the weather in the book is often appropriate to the mood swings of the characters in the book, and the region of Saro City receives rains that last several days. The first major weather fluctuation mentioned in the book is the sandstorm that Siferra 89 avoided by hiding under a tarpaulin with her crew. The other weather event was the monsoon-like rains that occurred after Sheerin 501 returned from a consultation in Jonglor, which is described as a northern city. Siferra 89 travels to Beklimot, which is described as half a world away from Jonglor. Beklimot is located on the Sagikan Peninsula, near mountains. Beklimot is in a sandy, arid desert region.

==Adaptations in other media==
In the 1950s, the story was adapted for the radio programs &quot;Dimension X&quot; and &quot;X Minus One&quot;.

In 1976, Analog Records, as their only release, presented a further dramatization of &quot;Nightfall&quot; on a rpm vinyl record, produced by James Cutting and recorded at American Learning Center. After the story, it includes a dialog between Isaac Asimov and Ben Bova.

&quot;Dawn&quot; is a 1981 novel written by Dean McLaughlin as a re-imagining of &quot;Nightfall&quot;.

In 1988, &quot;Nightfall&quot;, a low-budget movie, was produced based upon the story. The movie was shot on location at the Arcosanti Project, using the resident community members as background actors. Another film version, &quot;Nightfall&quot;, was made in 2000.

In 1989, George Alec Effinger wrote a parody of the original short story, titled &quot;Maureen Birnbaum After Dark.&quot; This story was included in the collections &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Friends&quot; and &quot;Maureen Birnbaum, Barbarian Swordsperson&quot;.

In April 2007, the story was the 100th episode of &quot;Escape Pod&quot;, a science-fiction podcast.

==In popular culture==
In a 2022 episode of the comedy series &quot;Young Sheldon&quot;, after the death of Asimov the main character Sheldon Cooper sets up a book club to discuss Asimov&#x27;s works as a tribute to him. &quot;Nightfall&quot; is chosen to be the first book to be discussed at the club.

<doc id="677827" wikidata="Q3018407" url="?curid=677827" title="David McGuinty">
<text>David Joseph McGuinty (born February 25, 1960) is a Canadian lawyer and politician who has been the minister of public safety since December 2024. A member of the Liberal Party, McGuinty has served as the member of Parliament (MP) for Ottawa South since 2004. From 2017 to 2024, McGuinty was the first chair of the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP), an agency which oversees Canadian intelligence services.

==Early life==
David McGuinty was born and raised in Ottawa, Ontario in a family of twelve. His parents are politician and professor Dalton McGuinty Sr. and full-time nurse Elizabeth McGuinty (née Pexton). Being the son of a Francophone mother and an Anglophone father, McGuinty is bilingual. He earned a Diploma in Agriculture from the Kemptville College of Agriculture, a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature at the University of Ottawa, specialized diplomas in Civil and Comparative Law at Université de Sherbrooke in Quebec, a Bachelor of Laws at the University of Ottawa, and finally a Master of Laws at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

An environmental lawyer by profession, he has long been closely involved in Liberal politics. He was chosen to serve as president and chief executive officer (CEO) of the Prime Minister&#x27;s National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy, a government think-tank concerned with sustainable development.

==Political career==

===Elections===
===In government (2004-2006)===
While not invited to join Paul Martin&#x27;s Cabinet, McGuinty served on the House of Commons Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable Development. He also served as chairman of the Liberal Party&#x27;s National Capital Region Caucus.

===In opposition (2006-2015)===

On May 30, 2006, interim Liberal leader Bill Graham appointed McGuinty as the Official Opposition critic for Transport.

In the 2006 Liberal leadership contest, McGuinty endorsed the candidacy of Michael Ignatieff.

With the election of Stephane Dion as leader of the Liberal Party McGuinty became the critic for Environment in January 2007.

With the appointment of Michael Ignatieff as leader of the party, McGuinty was named Environment and Energy critic when Ignatieff announced his shadow cabinet on January 22, 2009. In September 2010, McGuinty was promoted to the role of Opposition House Leader.

Following the resignation of Michael Ignatieff, Interim leader Bob Rae named McGuinty as the Liberal Party&#x27;s Critic for Natural Resources in June 2011, a demotion from his previous position as Opposition House Leader.

====Leadership aspirations====
In 2008, following the failed leadership of Stephane Dion and his pending resignation, McGuinty was considered a potential candidate to succeed him but announced in November 2008, that he would not seek the leader and instead endorsed Michael Ignatieff, Dion later appointed him as the critic for International Trade.

In 2011, when Ignatieff led the Liberal Party to their worst result in its history, McGuinty&#x27;s name was again mentioned as a possible candidate to succeed Ignatieff.

At the Liberal Party&#x27;s biennial convention in January 2012, McGuinty announced he was considering a bid for the leadership of the party and that he would make his decision over the coming months. However, on November 15, 2012, McGuinty confirmed he would not be seeking the Liberal leadership.

====International work====
In 2012 McGuinty was elected to head the Canadian chapter of an international alliance of lawmakers, Globe International, that presses governments to address global environment and economy challenges. He received all-party support to become the president of Globe Canada on June 12.

In 2012 McGuinty was invited by the National Democratic Institute to join their Pre-Election Assessment Mission to Ukraine.

====Oil and gas criticism====
On November 20, 2012, following a meeting of the Natural Resources Committee, McGuinty stated, among other things, that Conservative MPs were &quot;shilling&quot; for the oil and gas industry, did not belong in the national legislature, and should &quot;go back to Alberta.&quot;

The Conservative response was critical, as exemplified by Prime Minister Stephen Harper who said: &quot;I find it shameful, I guess not surprising, but shameful, that 30 years after the National Energy Program, these anti-Alberta attitudes are so close to the surface in the Liberal party.&quot; Interim leader Bob Rae apologized on behalf of the Liberal Party and said McGuinty was away on family business for the following week.

The following day McGuinty resigned as natural resources critic. He apologized saying, &quot;As member of Parliament for Ottawa South, I would like to unreservedly and unequivocally apologize for comments which I made with respect to parliamentary colleagues from the province of Alberta. My words in no way reflect the views of my party or leader, and I offer my apology to them as well as my colleagues from Alberta. I hold all parliamentarians in high esteem, and I regret my choice of words, as I can understand the offence they have caused.&quot;

====Attendance record====
In early 2014, McGuinty was accused of being a &quot;part-time&quot; Member of Parliament by the Conservative Riding Association, who were subsequently unable to explain how they calculated McGuinty&#x27;s time in the House of Commons, given that the House does not keep attendance records.

=== Back in government (2015-) ===

==== NSICOP Chair ====
In 2017, McGuinty was appointed as the first chair to the new established National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP). In 2024, as the chair of NSICOP, a report was released on foreign interference in Canada&#x27;s elections and society. It stated that the interference came from foreign governments such as China, India and Iran. McGuinty stated that he welcomed Canadians having discussions on foreign interference. However, he took issue that much of the attention was focused on the revelations that some MPs worked with foreign governments and not other aspects of interference like the media. McGuinty, also stated that political party leaders should not be partisan on the topic of foreign interference.

====Minister of Public Safety ====
Following a cabinet shuffle, McGuinty was appointed Minister of Public Safety in the 29th Canadian Ministry on December 20, 2024.

==Personal life==
McGuinty is the brother of former premier of Ontario Dalton McGuinty (born 1955) and the son of former member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) Dalton McGuinty Sr. (1926–1990). He is married to Brigitte Bélanger and has four children.

<text>The global [[digital divide]] describes global disparities, primarily between developed and developing countries, in regards to access to computing and information resources such as the Internet and the opportunities derived from such access.

The Internet is expanding very quickly, and not all countries—especially developing countries—can keep up with the constant changes. The term &quot;digital divide&quot; does not necessarily mean that someone does not have technology; it could mean that there is simply a difference in technology. These differences can refer to, for example, high-quality computers, fast Internet, technical assistance, or telephone services.

==Statistics==

There is a large inequality worldwide in terms of the distribution of installed telecommunication bandwidth. In 2014 only three countries (China, US, Japan) host 50% of the globally installed bandwidth potential (see pie-chart Figure on the right). This concentration is not new, as historically only ten countries have hosted 70–75% of the global telecommunication capacity (see Figure). The U.S. lost its global leadership in terms of installed bandwidth in 2011, being replaced by China, which hosts more than twice as much national bandwidth potential in 2014 (29% versus 13% of the global total).




==Versus the digital divide==
The global digital divide is a special case of the digital divide; the focus is set on the fact that &quot;Internet has developed unevenly throughout the world&quot; causing some countries to fall behind in technology, education, labor, democracy, and tourism. The concept of the digital divide was originally popularized regarding the disparity in Internet access between rural and urban areas of the United States of America; the &quot;global&quot; digital divide mirrors this disparity on an international scale.

The global digital divide also contributes to the inequality of access to goods and services available through technology. Computers and the Internet provide users with improved education, which can lead to higher wages; the people living in nations with limited access are therefore disadvantaged. This global divide is often characterized as falling along what is sometimes called the North–South divide of &quot;northern&quot; wealthier nations and &quot;southern&quot; poorer ones.

==Obstacles to a solution==
Some people argue that necessities need to be considered before achieving digital inclusion, such as an ample food supply and quality health care. Minimizing the global digital divide requires considering and addressing the following types of access:

===Physical access===
Involves &quot;the distribution of ICT devices per capita…and land lines per thousands&quot;. Individuals need to obtain access to computers, landlines, and networks in order to access the Internet. This access barrier is also addressed in Article 21 of the convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by the United Nations.

===Financial access===
The cost of ICT devices, traffic, applications, technician and educator training, software, maintenance, and infrastructures require ongoing financial means.
Financial access and &quot;the levels of household income play a significant role in widening the gap&quot;.

===Socio-demographic access===
Empirical tests have identified that several socio-demographic characteristics foster or limit ICT access and usage. Among different countries, educational levels and income are the most powerful explanatory variables, with age being a third one.

While a Global Gender Gap in access and usage of ICT&#x27;s exist, empirical evidence shows that this is due to unfavorable conditions concerning employment, education and income and not to technophobia or lower ability. In the contexts understudy, women with the prerequisites for access and usage turned out to be more active users of digital tools than men. In the US, for example, the figures for 2018 show 89% of men and 88% of women use the Internet.

===Cognitive access===
In order to use computer technology, a certain level of information literacy is needed. Further challenges include information overload and the ability to find and use reliable information.

===Design access===
Computers need to be accessible to individuals with different learning and physical abilities including complying with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 in the United States.

===Institutional access===
In illustrating institutional access, Wilson states &quot;the numbers of users are greatly affected by whether access is offered only through individual homes or whether it is offered through schools, community centers, religious institutions, cybercafés, or post offices, especially in poor countries where computer access at work or home is highly limited&quot;.

===Political access===
Guillen &amp; Suarez argue that &quot;democratic political regimes enable faster growth of the Internet than authoritarian or totalitarian regimes.&quot; The Internet is considered a form of e-democracy, and attempting to control what citizens can or cannot view is in contradiction to this. Recently situations in Iran and China have denied people the ability to access certain websites and disseminate information. Iran has prohibited the use of high-speed Internet in the country and has removed many satellite dishes in order to prevent the influence of Western culture, such as music and television.

===Cultural access===
Many experts claim that bridging the digital divide is not sufficient and that the images and language needed to be conveyed in a language and images that can be read across different cultural lines. A 2013 study conducted by Pew Research Center noted how participants taking the survey in Spanish were nearly twice as likely not to use the internet.

==Examples==

In the early 21st century, residents of developed countries enjoy many Internet services which are not yet widely available in developing countries, including:

* Mobile phones and small electronic communication devices;
* E-communities and social-networking;
* Fast broadband Internet connections, enabling advanced Internet applications;
* Affordable and widespread Internet access, either through personal computers at home or work, through public terminals in public libraries and Internet cafes, and through wireless access points;
*E-commerce enabled by efficient electronic payment networks like credit cards and reliable shipping services;
*Virtual globes featuring street maps searchable down to individual street addresses and detailed satellite and aerial photography;
* Online research systems which enable users to peruse newspaper and magazine articles that may be centuries old, without having to leave home;
* Electronic readers such as Kindle, Sony Reader, Samsung Papyrus and Iliad by iRex Technologies;
*Price engines which help consumers find the best possible online prices and similar services which find the best possible prices at local retailers;
*Electronic services delivery of government services, such as the ability to pay taxes, fees, and fines online.
* Further civic engagement through e-government and other sources such as finding information about candidates regarding political situations.

==Proposed remedies==
There are four specific arguments why it is important to &quot;bridge the gap&quot;:

*Economic equality – For example, the telephone is often seen as one of the most important components, because having access to a working telephone can lead to higher safety. If there were to be an emergency, one could easily call for help if one could use a nearby phone. In another example, many work-related tasks are online, and people without access to the Internet may not be able to complete work up to company standards. The Internet is regarded by some as a basic component of civic life that developed countries ought to guarantee for their citizens. Additionally, welfare services, for example, are sometimes offered via the Internet.
*Social mobility – Computer and Internet use is regarded as being very important to development and success. However, some children are not getting as much technical education as others, because lower socioeconomic areas cannot afford to provide schools with computer facilities. For this reason, some kids are being separated and not receiving the same chance as others to be successful.
*Democracy – Some people believe that eliminating the digital divide would help countries become healthier democracies. They argue that communities would become much more involved in events such as elections or decision making.
*Economic growth – It is believed that less-developed nations could gain quick access to economic growth if the information infrastructure were to be developed and well used. By improving the latest technologies, certain countries and industries can gain a competitive advantage.

While these four arguments are meant to lead to a solution to the digital divide, there are a couple of other components that need to be considered. The first one is rural living versus suburban living. Rural areas used to have very minimal access to the Internet, for example. However, nowadays, power lines and satellites are used to increase the availability in these areas. Another component to keep in mind is disabilities. Some people may have the highest quality technologies, but a disability they have may keep them from using these technologies to their fullest extent.

Using previous studies (Gamos, 2003; Nsengiyuma &amp; Stork, 2005; Harwit, 2004 as cited in James), James asserts that in developing countries, &quot;internet use has taken place overwhelmingly among the upper-income, educated, and urban segments&quot; largely due to the high literacy rates of this sector of the population. As such, James suggests that part of the solution requires that developing countries first build up the literacy/language skills, computer literacy, and technical competence that low-income and rural populations need in order to make use of ICT.

It has also been suggested that there is a correlation between democrat regimes and the growth of the Internet. One hypothesis by Gullen is, &quot;The more democratic the polity, the greater the Internet use...The government can try to control the Internet by monopolizing control&quot; and Norris &quot;et al.&quot; also contends, &quot;If there is less government control of it, the Internet flourishes, and it is associated with greater democracy and civil liberties.

From an economic perspective, Pick and Azari state that &quot;in developing nations…foreign direct investment (FDI), primary education, educational investment, access to education, and government prioritization of ICT as all-important&quot;. Specific remedies proposed by the study include: &quot;invest in stimulating, attracting, and growing creative technical and scientific workforce; increase the access to education and digital literacy; reduce the gender divide and empower women to participate in the ICT workforce; emphasize investing in intensive Research and Development for selected metropolitan areas and regions within nations&quot;.

There are projects worldwide that have implemented, to various degrees, the remedies outlined above. Many such projects have taken the form of Information Communications Technology Centers (ICT centers). Rahnman explains that &quot;the main role of ICT intermediaries is defined as an organization providing effective support to local communities in the use and adaptation of technology. Most commonly, an ICT intermediary will be a specialized organization from outside the community, such as a non-governmental organization, local government, or international donor. On the other hand, a social intermediary is defined as a local institution from within the community, such as a community-based organization.

Other proposed remedies that the Internet promises for developing countries are the provision of efficient communications within and among developing countries so that citizens worldwide can effectively help each other to solve their problems. Grameen Banks and Kiva loans are two microcredit systems designed to help citizens worldwide to contribute online towards entrepreneurship in developing communities. Economic opportunities range from entrepreneurs who can afford the hardware and broadband access required to maintain Internet cafés to agribusinesses having control over the seeds they plant.

At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the IMARA organization (from Swahili word for &quot;power&quot;) sponsors a variety of outreach programs which bridge the Global Digital Divide. Its aim is to find and implement long-term, sustainable remedies which will increase the availability of educational technology and resources to domestic and international communities. These projects are run under the aegis of the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and staffed by MIT volunteers who give training, install and donate computer setups in greater Boston, Massachusetts, Kenya, Indian reservations the American Southwest such as the Navajo Nation, the Middle East, and the Fiji Islands. The CommuniTech project strives to empower underserved communities through sustainable technology and education. According to Dominik Hartmann of the MIT&#x27;s Media Lab, interdisciplinary approaches are needed to bridge the global digital divide.

Building on the premise that any effective solution must be decentralized, allowing the local communities in developing nations to generate their content, one scholar has posited that social media—like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter—may be useful tools in closing the divide. As Amir Hatem Ali suggests, &quot;the popularity and generative nature of social media empower individuals to combat some of the main obstacles to bridging the digital divide&quot;. Facebook&#x27;s statistics reinforce this claim. According to Facebook, more than seventy-five percent of its users reside outside of the US. Moreover, more than seventy languages are presented on its website. The reasons for the high number of international users are due to many the qualities of Facebook and other social media. Amongst them, are its ability to offer a means of interacting with others, user-friendly features, and the fact that most sites are available at no cost. The problem with social media, however, is that it can be accessible, provided that there is physical access. Nevertheless, with its ability to encourage digital inclusion, social media can be used as a tool to bridge the global digital divide.

Some cities in the world have started programs to bridge the digital divide for their residents, school children, students, parents and the elderly. One such program, founded in 1996, was sponsored by the city of Boston and called the Boston Digital Bridge Foundation. It especially concentrates on school children and their parents, helping to make both equally and similarly knowledgeable about computers, using application programs, and navigating the Internet.

===Free Basics===

Free Basics is a partnership between social networking services company Facebook and six companies (Samsung, Ericsson, MediaTek, Opera Software, Nokia and Qualcomm) that plans to bring affordable access to selected Internet services to less developed countries by increasing efficiency, and facilitating the development of new business models around the provision of Internet access. In the whitepaper realised by Facebook&#x27;s founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, connectivity is asserted as a &quot;human right&quot;, and Internet.org is created to improve Internet access for people around the world.

&quot;Free Basics provides people with access to useful services on their mobile phones in markets where internet access may be less affordable. The websites are available for free without data charges, and include content about news, employment, health, education and local information etc. By introducing people to the benefits of the internet through these websites, we hope to bring more people online and help improve their lives.&quot;

However, Free Basics is also accused of violating net neutrality for limiting access to handpicked services. Despite a wide deployment in numerous countries, it has been met with heavy resistance notably in India where the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India eventually banned it in 2016.

===Satellite constellations===
Several projects to bring internet to the entire world with a satellite constellation have been devised in the last decade, one of these being Starlink by Elon Musk&#x27;s company SpaceX. Unlike Free Basics, it would provide people with a full internet access and would not be limited to a few selected services. In the same week Starlink was announced, serial-entrepreneur Richard Branson announced his own project OneWeb, a similar constellation with approximately 700 satellites that was already procured communication frequency licenses for their broadcast spectrum and could possibly be operational on 2020.

The biggest hurdle to these projects is the astronomical, financial, and logistical cost of launching so many satellites. After the failure of previous satellite-to-consumer space ventures, satellite industry consultant Roger Rusch said &quot;It&#x27;s highly unlikely that you can make a successful business out of this.&quot; Musk has publicly acknowledged this business reality, and indicated in mid-2015 that while endeavoring to develop this technically-complicated space-based communication system he wants to avoid overextending the company and stated that they are being measured in the pace of development.

As of 2023, Starlink is being actively deployed with the goal to clear licensure hurdles in every country open to its services.

===One Laptop per Child===
One Laptop per Child (OLPC) was an attempt by an American non-profit to narrow the digital divide. This organization, founded in 2005, provided inexpensively produced &quot;XO&quot; laptops (dubbed the &quot;$100 laptop&quot;, though actual production costs vary) to children residing in poor and isolated regions within developing countries. Each laptop belonged to an individual child and provides a gateway to digital learning and Internet access. The XO laptops were designed to withstand more abuse than higher-end machines, and they contained features in context to the unique conditions that remote villages present. Each laptop was constructed to use as little power as possible, had a sunlight-readable screen, and was capable of automatically networking with other XO laptops in order to access the Internet—as many as 500 machines can share a single point of access. The project went defunct in 2014.

==World Summit on the Information Society==
Several of the 67 principles adopted at the World Summit on the Information Society convened by the United Nations in Geneva in 2003 directly address the digital divide.

<doc id="677835" wikidata="Q1472004" url="?curid=677835" title="Former Yan">
<text>Yan, known in historiography as the Former Yan (; 337–370), was a dynastic state of China ruled by the Murong clan of the Xianbei during the Sixteen Kingdoms period. From Liaoning, the Former Yan later conquered and ruled over Hebei, Shaanxi, Shandong and Henan at its peak. They were notably the first of several Xianbei states to have establish their rule over the Central Plains. The prefix of &quot;Former&quot; is used in historiography to distinguish them from the other Yan states that came after them such as Later Yan.

Initially, Murong Huang and his son Murong Jun claimed the Eastern Jin-created title &quot;Prince of Yan&quot;, but subsequently, in 352, after seizing most of the former Later Zhao territory, Murong Jun would declare himself emperor, and after that point, the rulers of the Former Yan declared themselves &quot;emperors&quot;. The Yan changed their capital from time to time, with their last capital, Ye being the most prestigious due to its status as a major population hub.

==History==

=== Background ===
The Murong, named after their chieftain of the same name, were a Xianbei tribe under Tanshihuai&#x27;s confederation during the late-2nd century. As the confederation disintegrated, they resettled themselves around the Liaoxi region, where they feuded with the neighbouring Duan and Yuwen tribes. During the Three Kingdoms period, when the Cao Wei commander, Sima Yi, campaigned against Gongsun Yuan in 237, the Murong offered their assistance, and after the campaign, they were allowed to move into northern Liaodong. They became vassals to the Wei and then their successor, the Western Jin dynasty.

In 285, Murong Hui was installed as the new chieftain of his tribe. Although Hui rebelled against Jin shortly after ascending, he resubmitted in 289 and was given the office of Commander of the Xianbei. Hui moved his tribe inwards, eventually settling at Jicheng (棘城, in modern Jinzhou, Liaoning) and making it their capital, where they adopted an agricultural lifestyle and the Jin governing system. In 307, he declared himself Grand Chanyu of the Xianbei.

During the upheaval of the Five Barbarians, Murong Hui welcomed many fleeing refugees into his territory and recruited Chinese scholar-officials into his administration, even setting up new commaderies to accommodate them based on their native provinces. The refugees not only provided the Murong with manpower, but also introduced them to Central Plains culture and advanced agricultural techniques. As the Jin was driven out of the north, Hui effectively held independent control over his territory, but retained his status as a Jin vassal. Between 317 and 318, the Jin court in Jiankang acknowledged his positions and offered him the title of Duke of Changli. Hui initially rejected his ducal title, but in 321, accepted the other title of Duke of Liaodong.

=== Reign of Murong Huang ===
Murong Hui died in 333 and was succeeded by his son, Murong Huang. The Murong attempted to establish the Chinese succession rule from father to eldest son of the main wife, but this was in conflict with their traditional practice of lateral succession. Shortly after ascending, Huang&#x27;s brother, Murong Ren rebelled in eastern Liaodong and split the domain into two. Huang defeated Ren in 336, but the issue of succession continued to persist for the Murong even after they established their states. 

In 337, he took the title of Prince of Yan through the support of his officials. Most historians regard this event as the start of the Former Yan dynasty, with the name &quot;Former Yan&quot; being used to distinguish it between the other Yan states that came after it. In 341, Huang pressured the Jin court into formally recognizing his imperial title, but throughout his reign, he never explicitly declared independence and continued to consider himself as a Jin vassal. 

Murong Huang&#x27;s reign saw Former Yan rapidly expanding its influence. In 338, Yan allied with the Later Zhao dynasty to conquer the Duan tribe in Liaoxi. Though the campaign was a success, Zhao then betrayed Yan and laid siege on Jícheng. Despite heavy odds, Yan was able to repel the Zhao forces. In 340, Yan carried out a massive raid on Zhao, reaching all the way to Gaoyang Commandery (高陽郡; around present-day Gaoyang County, Hebei) and capturing 30,000 households before withdrawing.

In 342, Murong Huang moved the capital to Longcheng. Later that year, Former Yan invaded Goguryeo and sacked the capital Hwando, forcing their king Gogugwon into submission. In 344, they attacked the Yuwen tribe and destroyed their power base, while in 346, they invaded Buyeo and captured their king, Hyeon. As a result of these campaigns, the Former Yan became the sole military power in northeastern China. Huang also abolished the Eastern Jin era names within his domain in 345, instead claiming that they were now in the 12th year of his reign since he first succeeded his father.

=== Reign of Murong Jun ===
After Murong Huang&#x27;s death in 348, his son Murong Jun took the throne. In 349, the Later Zhao descended into civil war between members of the imperial family. Taking advantage of the confusion, Murong Jun began an invasion of the Central Plains, during which he moved the capital to Jìcheng (薊城; modern day Beijing) in 350. Soon, the Former Yan went head-to-head with the Ran Wei state, which superseded the Later Zhao, and in 352, the Wei emperor, Ran Min was captured by Murong Jun&#x27;s brother, Murong Ke at the Battle of Liantai. A few months later, Ran Min&#x27;s Crown Prince, Ran Zhi, surrendered to Former Yan at Ye.

The destruction of Ran Wei established Former Yan as a regional power on the North China Plain, competing with the Di-led Former Qin in the west and the Eastern Jin in the south. In 353, Murong Jun declared himself emperor and formally broke away from Jin. He continued to entrust Murong Ke with defeating the remnants of the Later Zhao, including the Duan Qi state in Shandong. As the situation stabilized on the Central Plains, Jun once again shifted his capital, this time to Ye in 357. Jun also had ambitions to conquer Jin by mobilizing an army of 1.5 million strong, but died of illness before realizing it in 360. 

=== Reign of Murong Wei ===
Murong Jun&#x27;s son, Murong Wei was still a child when he ascended the throne and was assigned with multiple regents. Before his death, Jun had offered to pass the throne to Murong Ke, but Ke refused and settled with becoming one of his nephew&#x27;s regents. Still, Ke held considerable power under Murong Wei, and traditional historians regarded him as one of the greatest statesmen and commanders of his period. In 365, he captured the ancient capital, Luoyang from Jin and brought the empire to its peak.

However, although Ke&#x27;s regency was marked with political stability and military might, corruption was also beginning to take its toll on the empire. One issue that plagued the empire was the decline of the state&#x27;s fiscal revenue; after entering the Central Plains, the Yan nobility held large swathes of private land where they amassed commoners and concealed the household population from the state to avoid paying taxes. As a result, the imperial treasury was stretched thin, many officials had unpaid salaries and the public grain stores were exhausted. Ke&#x27;s leadership initially mitigated the issue, but the situation quickly deteriorated after his untimely death in 367. Real power was then passed down to his notoriously corrupt uncle, Murong Ping.

While Murong Ke was entrusted with real power, another brother of Murong Jun, Murong Chui, was viewed with extreme suspicion by the emperor&#x27;s inner circle throughout Jun and Murong Wei&#x27;s reigns. In 369, the Eastern Jin commander, Huan Wen, launched an expedition to conquer the Former Yan. As the Yan court was thrown into a panic, Chui volunteered to lead the defense and decisively defeated Huan Wen at the Battle of Fangtou. However, his newfound success made Murong Ping apprehensive of him. After Ping attempted to kill him, Chui defected to the Former Qin.

During the Jin invasion, Yan had agreed to cede the Luoyang region to Qin for reinforcements, but went back on their promise after repelling the attack. Chui’s defection only further prompted Qin to begin their own conquest of Yan. Despite their numerical advantage, the incompetently-led main Yan force was destroyed by Wang Meng&#x27;s army at the Battle of Luchuan. Qin forces eventually reached Ye and Murong Wei was captured in 370. The destruction of the Former Yan established Former Qin as the main hegemon in the north, beginning their rapid unification of northern China.

Despite the Former Yan&#x27;s demise, Murong Huang&#x27;s descendants would go on to establish three more states during the Sixteen Kingdoms period. In the wake of the Former Qin&#x27;s collapse following the Battle of Fei River in 383, the Yan was restored as the Later Yan (384–407/409), founded by Murong Chui, and the Western Yan (384–394), founded by Murong Wei&#x27;s brother, Murong Hong. The Southern Yan (398–410) was a Murong state founded by a son of Murong Huang, Murong De.

<doc id="677867" wikidata="Q4997049" url="?curid=677867" title="Bullseye (British game show)">
<text>Bullseye is a British darts-themed television game show created by Andrew Wood and Norman Vaughan.

The original series aired on the ITV network and was produced by ATV in 1981, then by Central from 1982 until 1995. Jim Bowen presented the show during its initial 14-year run. A revival produced by Granada Yorkshire for the Challenge TV network, hosted by Dave Spikey, aired in 2006. A Christmas special, hosted by Freddie Flintoff, aired on ITV1 on 22 December 2024.

The show sported an animated mascot named Bully, an anthropomorphic large brown bull who wore a red and white striped shirt and blue trousers. &quot;Bullseye&quot; attracted audiences of up to 20 million viewers at its peak.

==History==
&quot;Bullseye&quot; was created and owned by Andrew Wood (with comedian Norman Vaughan), who came up with the idea after research into aspects of game shows with mass appeal. Programme associates on the show were Mickey Brennan and Roger Edwards.

The series was centred on darts. Three teams of contestants, each consisting of one amateur darts player and one trivia/quizzing expert, competed against one another to win cash and prizes. Available items ranged from major prizes such as new cars, caravans and luxury holidays to consolation prizes that included sets of darts, tankards/goblets (for male and female contestants respectively) and &quot;Bendy Bully&quot; rubber dolls of the show&#x27;s mascot.

The show originally aired on Monday nights in September 1981 and was produced by ATV. In 1982, &quot;Bullseye&quot; was moved to Sunday afternoons under the production of Central Television, and a new co-host, Tony Green, a professional darts referee and commentator, was brought in to keep track of the scores, at first out of vision, but in later years Green was promoted to an on-screen presence and from 1989 announced the subject scores. Nick Owen announced the contestants for the first two series of the show. During its run, viewing figures swelled to around 17 million viewers.

&quot;Bullseye&quot; was moved from Sunday afternoons to Saturday afternoons from 1993 to 1995. A 15th series was planned in 1996, however this was cancelled after Andrew Wood deemed that various changes and additions that Carlton and the ITV network centre were pressing for to update and &#x27;modernise&#x27; the show to be unsuitable for the series and he believed it would lose its appeal as a result. At the end of its original run, &quot;Bullseye&quot; was still attracting audiences of up to 10 million viewers. After an eleven-year hiatus, &quot;Bullseye&quot; was revived for a new series, which was recorded for the digital channel Challenge. It was produced by Granada at Yorkshire Television in the Leeds Studios, and was hosted by Dave Spikey. Tony Green also returned to the show as co-host, reprising his role from the original series.

On screen, the show evolved as follows:

The first three series had the players throwing (from the point of view of the viewers and the audience) towards the right for the first round and to the left for all subsequent rounds. From the fourth series, all three boards in use rotated on a single pillar, and all throws were to the audience&#x27;s right. The first four series featured opening titles of Bully jumping out of a sign and walking into a pub to play darts; this was shortened from series 2 onwards, with new theme music and musical beds from series 4. The opening credits of series 1, much longer than the version used from series 2 onwards, although containing numerous elements of what would become the show&#x27;s familiar theme, feature a noticeably different arrangement of the theme tune.

From series 5, the entire set was essentially inverted. The studio audience would now be seen in shot throughout the show, and the viewers would see all darts being thrown to the left. From the studio audience&#x27;s point of view, everybody continued to throw to the right. Series 5 also saw Bully driving the team bus in the opening titles and ejecting himself from the driver&#x27;s seat to ride a flying dart. These titles also featured cartoon depictions of Bowen at the front of the coach, and Eric Bristow, John Lowe, Dave Whitcombe, Keith Deller, Cliff Lazarenko, Bob Anderson, Jocky Wilson and Mike Gregory at the back. This same title sequence was used for the revived series, but featuring depictions of presenter Dave Spikey at the front of the coach and professional darts players of the 2000s at the back.

A new set was introduced in the 11th series, with Bowen – who since the second series had opened the show by coming through the audience – now making his entrance through the opening that would then drop a panel behind which the star prize would be hidden. Once the show moved to Saturday afternoons, the opening titles consisted of Bully jumping out of the logo at the back of the studio and charging about to cause chaos on the set, introduced in the 13th series.

For &quot;Comic Relief&quot; in March 1993, a special crossover between &quot;Bullseye&quot; and the BBC&#x27;s snooker-based game show &quot;Big Break&quot; (the creation of which had been partly influenced by &quot;Bullseye&quot;) was planned, with guest comedians as contestants, and with Bowen and &quot;Big Break&quot; host Jim Davidson, along with scorers Tony Green and &quot;Big Break&quot;&#x27;s John Virgo, effectively taking their counterpart&#x27;s role within the game for humorous effect. Bowen and Davidson were both very enthusiastic about the idea; however the proposal never came to fruition, reportedly after ITV wanted the rights to repeat broadcasts as a self-contained programme, to which the BBC declined.

Bowen once described &quot;Bullseye&quot; as &quot;the second-best darts-based game-show on television&quot;. There were no others at the time.

===John Cooper appearance===
In 1989, John Cooper appeared on the show. He was later convicted of multiple burglaries, armed robberies, and, in 2011, following advances in forensic science, two double murders, one rape, and another sexual assault. Footage of his appearance on the show was later used by the prosecution to match him to witness reports at the time.

==Rounds==

===Bully&#x27;s Category Board===
A dartboard divided into 10 sectors was used, each representing a different category and further subdivided into outer, middle and inner areas. Three rounds were played, with every team receiving one turn in each and playing in the same order. On a team&#x27;s turn, the darts player threw one dart and attempted to hit either the bullseye or a category chosen by their partner. Doing so awarded a cash bonus to the team and allowed the partner to answer a question in the chosen category. However, if the dart hit a different category that was still in play, no bonus was awarded and the partner had to answer a question in that category instead. Hitting a category that was out of play or failing to hit the board at all forfeited the team&#x27;s turn. Questions were worth £30 each in Round 1, £50 in Round 2, and £100 in Round 3. The values on the board (working inward from the edge) were £30, £50, and £100; the bullseye awarded £200 and was always in play. Categories were removed from play after one question had been asked.

In the first series, the board values were £20, £10, and £30, working inward from the edge. The result of each throw determined the category and value of the question to be asked; no bonus was awarded for hitting the bullseye or the category chosen by the non-darts player. A bullseye allowed that contestant to select any question value and awarded £50 for a correct answer.

Starting in series 3, if the contestant in control missed the question, the first opponent to buzz-in could answer and attempt to steal the money. In early series, the opponents could silently buzz-in during the question and/or while the contestant was thinking, but were only asked for a response if the contestant missed. Later, they could only buzz-in after a miss, triggering an audible signal. If neither opponent buzzed-in, or if the first to do so also missed, the host gave the correct answer and the game continued.

For the first seven series, the lowest-scoring team was eliminated from the game after the first round. In the event of a tie for low score, the darts players for the tied teams each threw three darts at a standard matchplay board and the high scorer&#x27;s team advanced. From series 8 on, all three teams continued to the next portion of the game.

===Pounds for Points===
Each darts player threw three darts at a standard matchplay board, and the one who achieved the highest score won control of a question for their partner. Starting in series 2, an incorrect response passed the question to the team with the second-highest score, then the third if necessary; the first team to respond correctly won £1 per point scored by their darts player.

Initially, if two or more darts players achieved the same total, a re-throw was held and the high scorer won control of the question, for the value of the original throw. Later, the re-throw was eliminated and the question was played on the buzzer by the tied partners.

During the first series, the partner of the highest-scoring darts player in each round could choose to answer a question worth £25, £50, or £101. In the event of a tie, the darts players each threw one dart at a board divided into concentric circles, and the one who hit closer to the centre won control of the question.

After three questions, the team with the highest cash total from the first two games went through to play Bully&#x27;s Prize Board. In the first series alone, the team who won the most money in the Pounds for Points game alone went through to Bully&#x27;s Prize Board.

All three teams received their accumulated cash totals, as well as show-themed souvenirs that included darts, pens, key rings, patches, tankards (or goblets for female contestants), and &quot;Bendy Bully&quot; rubber dolls in the likeness of the show&#x27;s mascot.

At the beginning of part two, a professional darts player (or occasionally a celebrity during the first four series and the 2006 revival) would throw nine darts at the matchplay board. The show donated £1 per point scored to a charity of the winning team&#x27;s choice, or £2 per point if the total was 301 or higher. Celebrity players often performed badly and would contribute some of their own money to the donation.

One episode of series four originally broadcast on 3 December 1984, featured comedienne Carol Lee Scott as the celebrity guest darts thrower. Bowen and Scott had known each other for many years prior after both having appeared on the same bill at various working clubs. However, as mentioned in Bowen&#x27;s 1998 biography &quot;From a Bundle of Rags: Autobiography of Jim Bowen&quot;, the pair had a backstage exchange after filming of the episode, with Bowen commenting on Scott&#x27;s performance which led to the pair trading several offhand comments, after which they refused to ever speak again.

====Bronze Bully Trophy====
During series 5 through 13 (1985 to 1994), the professional who recorded the highest score in the charity interlude over the course of an individual series won a Bronze Bully Trophy. The winners:

*1985–86: John Lowe
*1986–87: Lionel Smith
*1987–88: Ray Farrell
*1988–89: Mike Gregory
*1989–90: Eric Bristow
*1990–91: Bob Anderson
*1991–92: Mandy Solomons
*1992–93: Mike Gregory
*1994: Kevin Painter
===Bully&#x27;s Prize Board===
The team with the highest cash total from both rounds faced a board divided into eight pairs of alternating narrow red and wide black sectors, with a bullseye at the centre. The red sectors were numbered 1 through 8, each corresponding to a different prize, and the bullseye represented a larger item, &quot;Bully&#x27;s Special Prize.&quot; The team threw nine darts, the first and last three by the darts player and the middle three by their partner, and won the prizes for all red sectors they hit. Black sectors awarded nothing, and hitting the same red sector twice forfeited that prize—hence the show&#x27;s catchphrase, &quot;Keep out of the black and in the red, nothing in this game for two in a bed.&quot; A third hit to the same sector awarded the prize once again.

For most of the programme&#x27;s original run, prize values were restricted by the Independent Broadcasting Authority, which may explain the perceived poor quality of prizes on offer. Although some prizes (such as a remote-controlled toy car or a &quot;TV with wired remote control&quot;) were laughed at by the studio audience even then, smaller prizes were taken for granted at the time, and they seemed relatively lavish compared to those on offer in BBC game shows such as &quot;Blankety Blank&quot;. In a 2006 episode, Bully&#x27;s Special Prize was a fully functional show-themed Fruit Machine.

During the first series, only the Pounds for Points scores were used to determine the winner, and the non-winning sectors were green rather than black.

===Bully&#x27;s Star Prize Gamble===
After throwing their nine darts at Bully&#x27;s Prize Board, the winning team had to decide whether to risk their prizes for a chance at &quot;Bully&#x27;s Star Prize,&quot; a large mystery prize hidden behind a screen in the studio. For the first ten series, the money they had won for themselves was not at risk; beginning with series 11, they had to put up both their money and prizes in order to play. (The team&#x27;s souvenirs and the money won by the professional for their charity were never at risk.) If they chose to try for the Star Prize, they were given six darts (three per person; non-darts player throwing first) to score 101 or more on a standard matchplay dartboard. If they succeeded, they received the Star Prize and kept their previous winnings; if not, they lost all cash/prizes they had risked. When money was at stake during Bowen&#x27;s tenure as host, he would tell the team that they would receive nothing except their &quot;BFH&quot; (bus fare home) if they lost.

If the winning team declined to play, the second-place team had the option to risk their money and try to win the prize; if this pair also declined, the third-place team was given the same choice. The actual prize was only revealed after a team had played the round, win or lose, or if all three teams chose not to play.

Bully&#x27;s Star Prize was usually a holiday (especially in later series), a car, a caravan or a speedboat. Less lavish Star Prizes (fitted kitchens and the like) were sometimes given away in the early series, so as to fit within the IBA&#x27;s prize limits at the time. In an episode from 1987, the Star Prize was a £2,000 fashion spree. After the prize limits were abolished in 1993, the Star Prize in Bowen&#x27;s final two series would sometimes be &quot;Bully&#x27;s Treasure Chest,&quot; a cash award of £5,000.

From series 8 onwards, if the second- and third-place teams had the same total, both were asked if they wanted to gamble. If both said yes, the two darts players threw three darts each at the matchplay board and the higher score won the right to play for the Star Prize.

On the show, it was never made clear if the two winning contestants had to share the Star Prize or if they got one each.

On charity Christmas specials, in which celebrities and professional darts players teamed up to play for nominated charities, the winning team&#x27;s accumulated cash total and prizes were not at risk. The cash would be doubled if they won Bully&#x27;s Star Prize Gamble.

==Remakes==
Although not strictly a remake but more of a show influenced by the original, Welsh language TV channel S4C has a darts gameshow called &quot;Oci, Oci, Oci&quot;, which uses the concept of darts and questions to win prizes. Instead of in a studio, the show is at various social clubs and pubs each week. The show has two people who handle the questions and two playing darts.

===&quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Gameshow Marathon&quot;===
In 2005, it was announced that programme creator Andrew Wood had signed a contract with Granada Media for Granada to produce a one-hour long celebrity special &quot;Bullseye&quot; show to be hosted by Ant &amp; Dec. This special was part of &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Gameshow Marathon&quot;, in turn part of ITV&#x27;s 50th anniversary celebrations, and was aired on ITV on 22 October 2005. Vernon Kay and &quot;Coronation Street&quot; star William Roache were the contestants, accompanied by professional darts players Eric Bristow and Andy Fordham, while Tony Green reprised his role as co-host.

===Challenge TV revival===
Subsequently, Granada decided that a new series of &quot;Bullseye&quot; would be produced early the following year on Challenge and that the show was to be hosted by comedian Dave Spikey. Bully was also redesigned for the new series, albeit very similar to the Bully used in the original series.

The new series of &quot;Bullseye&quot; returned on Challenge in April 2006. The show maintained the style of prizes from the original, bar white goods; none of the cash prizes had increased in value since the second series in 1982, although the bullseye on the category board had decreased to £150 from the £200 of the original series. Some of the prizes from Bully&#x27;s Prize Board were of more modern gameshow standard, such as a TFT television and an MP3 player. Dave Spikey and Tony Green commented on BBC Radio 1&#x27;s Colin and Edith show on 19 April 2006: &quot;...[&quot;Bullseye&quot; is] The only gameshow on the television in which the prizes get a round of applause...&quot;.

The revived series was strikingly similar to the original series. Whilst refreshed, the show maintained the original theme music and stings and used a remade version of the original&#x27;s second title sequence, Bully driving the team bus. A cartoon version of Dave Spikey replaced Jim&#x27;s in the titles. The Challenge revival ran for thirty episodes.

===&quot;Vernon Kay&#x27;s Gameshow Marathon&quot;===
On 19 May 2007, another one-hour long celebrity special was aired on ITV, this time as part of &quot;Vernon Kay&#x27;s Gameshow Marathon&quot;. This time the contestants were newsreader Andrea Catherwood, footballer Graeme Le Saux and another &quot;Coronation Street&quot; star, Michael Le Vell, paired with professional darts players Martin Adams, Phil Taylor and Raymond van Barneveld respectively. Once again, Tony Green reprised his co-host role. Jim Bowen did not appear on the &quot;Bullseye&quot; episode; instead, he appeared on the marathon&#x27;s remake of &quot;The Golden Shot&quot;, acting as &quot;Bowen the Bolt&quot; (instead of &quot;Bernie the Bolt&quot;). At one point, he did make the comment to Kay, &quot;Vernon, this is a bit like &quot;Bullseye&quot; used to be...throwing arrows for prizes!&quot;

===Potential series revival; &quot;Alan Carr&#x27;s Epic Gameshow&quot;===
In March 2018, it was rumoured that Vernon Kay would front a reboot of &quot;Bullseye&quot;. However, he later denied that he was fronting the new reboot of &quot;Bullseye&quot;. In June 2019 it was announced that &quot;Bullseye&quot;, as one of the country&#x27;s five all-time favourite game shows, was to be &quot;supersized and rebooted&quot; in a new series, &quot;Alan Carr&#x27;s Epic Gameshow&quot; for broadcast on 4 July 2020. Commissioned by ITV, the series was filmed at dock10 studios and presented by Alan Carr.

===2024 Christmas special revival===
A Christmas special was commissioned by ITV in 2024 with Freddie Flintoff as the host. He commented &quot;I love the darts and Bullseye was one of my favourite shows as a kid. Can’t quite believe I’ll get to host this Christmas special.” He added “You can’t beat a bit of Bully!”. Katie Rawcliffe, director of entertainment and daytime commissioning at ITV said: “Bullseye is back and we can’t wait to welcome Freddie Flintoff back to ITV too. “It’s a real treat to have both as key parts of our Christmas schedule on ITV1 and ITVX this year.”

==Merchandise==
For the Christmas 2005 season, a &quot;Bullseye&quot; DVD game was released by board game manufacturer Upstarts. Although the game did not feature Bowen or Green, it did feature a redesigned Bully. A second DVD game titled &quot;Classic Bullseye&quot; was released by ITV DVD for the 2006 Christmas season, which featured both Bowen and the voice of Green, and also classic footage from the show. An updated version, &quot;All New Bullseye&quot;, was released in 2007.

Several board games based on the show have also been released.

In the 80s and 90s, there were licensed videogames on the ZX Spectrum, the Acorn and the Commodore 64.

A version for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 was developed and published by Sabec, and released in June 2021.

<doc id="677868" wikidata="Q1804303" url="?curid=677868" title="Spuyten Duyvil Creek">
<text>Spuyten Duyvil Creek () is a short tidal estuary in New York City connecting the Hudson River to the Harlem River Ship Canal and then on to the Harlem River. The confluence of the three water bodies separate the island of Manhattan from the Bronx and the rest of the mainland. Once a distinct, turbulent waterway between the Hudson and Harlem rivers, the creek has been subsumed by the modern ship canal.

The Bronx neighborhood of Spuyten Duyvil lies to the north of the estuary creek, and the adjacent Manhattan neighborhood of Marble Hill lies to the north of the Ship Canal.

==Etymology==
The earliest use of the name &quot;Spuyten Duyvil&quot; was in 1653, in a document from Dutch landowner Adriaen van der Donck to the Dutch West India Company. It may be literally translated as &quot;Spouting Devil&quot; or &quot;Spuitende Duivel&quot; in Dutch; a reference to the strong and wild tidal currents found at that location. It may also be translated as &quot;Spewing Devil&quot; or &quot;Spinning Devil&quot;, or more loosely as &quot;Devil&#x27;s Whirlpool&quot; or &quot;Devil&#x27;s Spate.&quot; &quot;Spui&quot; is a Dutch word involving outlets for water. Historian Reginald Pelham Bolton, however, argues that the phrase means &quot;sprouting meadow&quot;, referring to a fresh-water spring. A folk etymology, &quot;to spite the Devil&quot; or &quot;in spite of the devil&quot;, was popularized by a story in Washington Irving&#x27;s &quot;A Knickerbocker&#x27;s History of New York&quot; published in 1809. Set in the 17th century, the story tells of fictional trumpeter Anthony Van Corlaer summoned by Dutch colonial governor Peter Stuyvesant to warn settlers of a British invasion attempt, with Corlaer attempting to swim across the creek in treacherous conditions.

An extensive appendix to &quot;Studies in Etymology and Etiology: With Emphasis on Germanic, Jewish, Romance and Slavic Languages&quot; (2009) by David L. Gold, which includes commentary by Rob Rentenaar, professor of onomastics at the University of Amsterdam, goes into great detail about all the various translations for &quot;Spuyten Duyvil&quot; which have been mooted over the years. Rentenaar concludes that &quot;Duyvil&quot; means &quot;devil&quot;, either literally or in a transferred sense, but he could not determine what the intended meaning of &quot;Spuyten&quot; was because of the many variants that have been used throughout history.

The local Lenape Native Americans referred to the creek by several names. The first was &quot;Shorakapok&quot; or &quot;Shorackhappok&quot;, translated as “the sitting down place” or “the place between the ridges”. A second term, spelled various ways including &quot;Paparinemo&quot; or &quot;Papiriniman&quot;, was shared with a triangular island formed by the junction of the creek and Tibbetts Brook in today&#x27;s Kingsbridge neighborhood. The word has been translated as &quot;place where the stream is shut&quot; or to &quot;parcel out&quot; or &quot;divide&quot;. A third name, &quot;Muscoota&quot;, was also used.

==History==

=== Early history ===

Spuyten Duyvil Creek was originally a narrow tidal strait connecting the Hudson River to the west and the headwaters of the Harlem River to the east, both of which were fed by the waters of Tibbetts Brook flowing south from the Bronx. When the Dutch settlers arrived they found its tidal waters turbulent and difficult to handle. Though its tides raced, there was no navigable watercourse joining it with the headwaters of the Harlem River, which flowed in an S-shaped course southwest and then north into the East River. Steep cliffs along the Spuyten Duyvil&#x27;s mouth at the Hudson prevented any bridge there, but upstream it narrowed into a rocky drainage. Prior to the development of the Bronx, the creek was fed by Tibbetts Brook, which begins in Yonkers, Westchester County and intersected with the creek at modern West 230th Street. The brook currently ends above ground within Van Cortlandt Park, emptying into the Harlem River system at the Wards Island Water Pollution Control Plant via underground sewers.

During the 17th century, the only mode of transportation across the Harlem River was by ferry from the east end of 125th Street. The ferry was established in 1667 and operated by Johannes Verveelen, a local landowner. Many settlers circumvented the toll for the ferry by crossing the creek from northern Marble Hill to modern Kingsbridge, Bronx, a point where it was feasible to wade or swim through the waters. This area was known as the &quot;wading place&quot;, and had previously been used by Native Americans. In response, Verveelen had the creek fenced off at the wading place, though travelers simply tore the barrier down. In 1669 Verveelen transplanted his ferry to the northern tip of Marble Hill, at today&#x27;s Broadway and West 231st Street.

In 1693 Frederick Philipse, a Dutch nobleman who had sworn allegiance to the Crown upon the British takeover of Dutch New Netherlands, built the King&#x27;s Bridge at Marble Hill near what is now West 230th Street in the Bronx. Originally a merchant in New Amsterdam, Philipse had purchased vast landholdings in what was then Westchester County. Granted the title Lord of Philipse Manor, he established a plantation and provisioning depot for his shipping business upriver on the Hudson in present-day Sleepy Hollow. His toll bridge provided access and opened his land to settlement. Later, it carried the Boston Post Road. In 1758, the Free Bridge was erected by Jacob Dyckman, opening on January 1, 1759. Stagecoach service was later established across the span. The new bridge proceeded to take much of the traffic away from the King&#x27;s Bridge. The Free Bridge was destroyed during the American Revolution. Following the war, Philipse Manor was forfeited to the state legislature, after which the King&#x27;s Bridge was free.

===Harlem River Ship Canal===

Over time the channels of the Spuyten Duyvil and Harlem River were joined and widened and additional bridges were constructed, but maritime transit was still difficult and confined to small craft. By 1817, a narrow canal was dug through the south end of Marble Hill at approximately 222nd Street, known as &quot;Boltons&#x27; Canal&quot; or &quot;Dyckman Canal&quot;.

With the completion of the Erie Canal in 1825, and the advent of large steamships in the second half of the 19th century, a broad shipping canal was proposed between the Harlem and Hudson Rivers to allow them thru-transit by bypassing the tight turn up and around Marble Hill. The Harlem Canal Company (then stylized as the &quot;Harlaem Canal Company&quot;) was founded in 1826, but did not make any progress towards building a canal. A second company also failed to complete the project. In 1863 the Hudson and Harlem River Canal Company was created, and began the final plans for the canal. The U.S. Congress broke the logjam in 1873 by appropriating money for a survey of the relevant area, following which New York state bought the necessary land and gave it to the federal government. In 1876, the New York State Legislature issued a decree for the construction of the canal. Construction of the Harlem River Ship Canal – officially the United States Ship Canal – finally started in January 1888. The canal would be in width and have a depth of to . It would be cut directly through the rock of Dyckman&#x27;s Meadow, making a straight course to the Hudson River. The first section of the canal, the cut at Marble Hill, was completed in 1895 and opened on June 17 of that year. Several festivities including parades were held to commemorate the occasion. At this time, Tibbets Brook was diverted into storm drains underneath Broadway, with the old right-of-way becoming Tibbett Avenue.

A bridge opened over the former Marble Hill alignment of the creek in 1900, carrying Broadway. The bridge&#x27;s superstructure was demolished shortly afterward, with the construction of the IRT subway above Broadway in 1904. The effect of channeling through what had been 222nd and 223rd streets was to physically isolate Marble Hill on the Bronx side of the new creek. In 1914 the original creekbed was filled in with rock from the excavation of Grand Central Terminal&#x27;s foundation during its construction; and the temporary island, comprising present-day Marble Hill, became physically attached to the Bronx, though it remained politically part of the borough of Manhattan, as it is today. The bridge carrying Broadway over the former alignment of the creek at 230th Street was destroyed in the late 1920s.
In 1919, New York State passed a bill in order to straighten the western end of the creek feeding into the Hudson. At the time, the creek was diverted south to avoid a peninsula that housed the Johnson Iron Works foundry. The foundry held out until 1923 when it vacated the premises, and in 1927 was awarded $3.28 million in compensation, just over a third of their original demand of $11.53 million. Plans to excavate the channel were finalized in 1935, and the channel was excavated from 1937 to 1938. The work severed the Johnson foundry&#x27;s peninsula of land from the Bronx, which was then absorbed into Manhattan&#x27;s Inwood Hill Park; the peninsula now contains the park&#x27;s Nature Center.

Today, Spuyten Duyvil Creek, the Harlem River Ship Canal, and the Harlem River form a continuous channel, referred to collectively as the Harlem River. Broadway Bridge, a combination road and rail lift span, continues to link Marble Hill with Manhattan. There is little evidence that the building of the Ship Canal enhanced commerce in the city.

==Bridges==
Three bridges cross the Spuyten Duyvil Creek; from west to east, they are:

*The Spuyten Duyvil Bridge, a railroad swing bridge that carries Amtrak&#x27;s Empire Corridor between Penn Station and Albany. The bridge opened in 1900 and carries one railroad track (though previously had two tracks).
*The Henry Hudson Bridge, a bi-level steel arch toll bridge carrying the Henry Hudson Parkway (NY 9A). The bridge was proposed in 1904, but due to opposition by local residents, was not completed and opened until 1936.
*Broadway Bridge, a vertical lift bridge carrying pedestrian and vehicular traffic using Broadway (US 9) on the lower level, and the New York City Subway&#x27;s on the upper level. The first bridge opened in 1895 and was later relocated to 207th Street/Fordham Road on the Harlem River, becoming known as the University Heights Bridge; the current bridge, the third on the site, opened in 1962.

<doc id="677885" wikidata="Q1815659" url="?curid=677885" title="Less than Zero (novel)">
<text>Less than Zero is the debut novel of Bret Easton Ellis, published in 1985. It was his first published effort, released when he was 21 years old, and still a student at Bennington College. The novel was titled after the Elvis Costello song of the same name.

==Plot summary==
The novel follows the life of Clay, a rich young college student who has returned to his hometown of Los Angeles, California for winter break circa 1984. Through first-person narration, Clay describes his progressive alienation from the culture around him, loss of faith in his friends, and his meditations on events in his recent past.

After reuniting with his ex-girlfriend Blair, and friends like Trent, now a successful model, Clay embarks on a series of drug-fueled nights of partying, during which he has one-night stands with both sexes. While partying, he tries to track down his best friend from high school, Julian, with whom he hasn&#x27;t spoken in months. In between descriptions of his days and nights, Clay recounts a vacation spent with his parents and grandparents, during which he seemed to be the only person concerned that his grandmother was dying of cancer.

Over time, Clay becomes progressively disillusioned with the party scene as he witnesses the apathy of his friends towards the suffering of each other and those around them. At one party he watches as the revellers joke and take Polaroids of his friend Muriel while she injects heroin; at another, he and Blair are the only two who exhibit revulsion when Trent shows a snuff film, which sexually excites several partygoers.

Clay ultimately tracks down Julian, who borrows a large sum of money from Clay. At first Julian says the money is for an abortion, but Clay doesn&#x27;t believe him. Later when Clay asks Julian to pay him back, Julian brings him to meet his abusive pimp, Finn. It is revealed that Julian has become a heroin addict and turned to prostitution in order to pay off a debt to unnamed drug dealers. Believing what he has been told, yet still feeling an empty desire to witness this awful scene for himself, Clay accompanies Julian to a rendezvous in a hotel room with a married closeted businessman from Indiana, where he is compelled by the john to watch the man and Julian have sex for several hours.

After attending a concert with his friends, Clay accompanies them to an alleyway where they stare fascinated at the corpse of a young man, presumably dead by overdose. Afterward, Clay follows the group back to the home of his drug dealer Rip, who wants to show off his latest acquisition: a sex slave whom Rip has been keeping drugged in his bedroom. When Clay tells Rip, &quot;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s right,&quot; Rip says, &quot;What&#x27;s right?&quot; Clay leaves, but Trent decides to stay so that he can participate.

Now feeling completely isolated and with winter break coming to an end, Clay reflects on the brutal nature of his surroundings as he returns to college in New Hampshire.

==Background==
Ellis began work on what would become &quot;Less than Zero&quot; in 1980. He cites his major influences as Joan Didion and Los Angeles noir, but he was also inspired by the moral ambiguity of &quot;American Gigolo&quot;.

&quot;Less than Zero&quot; was to become Ellis&#x27; first attempt at a proper novel, following much roman à clef juvenilia. Its first draft was incredibly emotional and overwrought, and in the third-person. Ellis&#x27;s creative writing teacher, novelist Joe McGinniss, advised that he return to the first-person style of roman à clef (which Ellis was hesitant to do) and Ellis stripped it back, from there evoking the minimalist style for which it became famous.

In the former child actor Danny Bonaduce&#x27;s 2002 autobiography, &quot;Random Acts of Badness&quot;, Bonaduce notes the striking similarity between the fictional high school in &quot;Less than Zero&quot; and The Buckley School in Sherman Oaks, California, where Bonaduce, recording artist Michael Jackson, film actor Christian Brando, and other children of wealth and celebrity, including Ellis himself, went to school together. In commenting on the novel, Bonaduce said, &quot;When the book &quot;Less Than Zero&quot; came out, all my classmates were pissed. Not because it was an exact portrayal of our school – but because we failed to get any royalties.&quot;

== Characters ==
&quot;Less than Zero&quot; has an extensive cast of characters; the ones listed play major roles throughout the novel.
; Clay
: The 18-year-old protagonist, a student at Camden College in New Hampshire, who comes home to Los Angeles for Christmas and meets his old friends. He revives his old life: parties, concerts, drugs, sex, the city. Clay has brief affairs (a male USC student named Griffin (pp. 35–39), and an unnamed female character (pp. 120–122)), but he goes through periods of apathy and longing for his girlfriend Blair.
; Blair
: Clay&#x27;s ex-girlfriend who is studying at USC. Clay is unsure how he feels about her; neither has he been faithful to her. They vacation together and though at first they enjoy the experience, it eventually becomes tedious and ends on a sour note.
; Julian Wells
: Clay&#x27;s friend from grade school and high school. Julian is often described as &quot;thin&quot; and many of Clay&#x27;s friends declare him &quot;completely fucked up&quot;. Julian has become a heroin addict and a prostitute.
; Trent Burroughs
: Another of Clay&#x27;s friends, a model who attends UCLA. He says things that Clay doesn&#x27;t understand and Clay gradually becomes disenchanted with him. Trent is shown as increasingly unethical and immoral, raping a drugged twelve-year-old girl in his penultimate scene.
; Rip Millar
: Clay&#x27;s dealer. Sporting a fedora and a penthouse on Wilshire Boulevard, Rip is also a DJ, but feels his trust fund &quot;might never run out.&quot; At the end of the story, he shows Clay and other young men a 12-year-old girl naked, drugged and tied to his bed to be a sex slave. When a distressed Clay questions Rip as to why he has done this, Rip replies &quot;Why not? What the hell?&quot;
; Daniel Carter
: Daniel is another student who attends Camden and is from Los Angeles. Many of the characters think he&#x27;s gay. In his earlier appearances, he was worried he had gotten a girl from Camden, Vanden, pregnant, but then doesn&#x27;t seem to care. In his final appearance, he tells Clay he won&#x27;t return to Camden, opting instead to stay in LA and write a screenplay. (Vanden, who isn&#x27;t seen in the book, later appears in &quot;American Psycho&quot; as well as &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot;, in which she and Clay are briefly &quot;involved&quot;.)
; The Handsome Dunce
: A minor character who has a cameo speaking to Clay at Blair&#x27;s Christmas party. He goes on to appear in &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot;, where it is revealed that he goes to Camden College and that his name is Steve.
; Kim
: One of Blair&#x27;s friends. During the course of the book she&#x27;s never sure where her film producer mother is and only knows what she reads in trade papers. At one point in the novel, she and Clay both agitate each other notably when they repeatedly question each other, &quot;What do you do?&quot;, &quot;What do you do?&quot;, this ending with Kim finally replying, &quot;Don&#x27;t ask me because...I don&#x27;t know.&quot;
; Alana
: Another one of Blair&#x27;s friends. She has an abortion and comes to Clay afterwards. Clay lets her stay in his room for the night while he lies by the pool until dawn. When he goes back up, she informs him she has bled a lot and feels weak before thanking him. When he asks &quot;what for?&quot; she says &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; and leaves. When Clay flushes his toilet, it becomes clogged up with tissue and blood clouds the water. Clay puts the lid down as &quot;there&#x27;s nothing else for me to do&quot;.
; Muriel
: An anorexic girl who Clay visits at a rehabilitation center. She appears a few times in the novel, most notably at a New Year&#x27;s party where she shoots heroin publicly while laughing and crying.
; Finn Delaney
: Julian&#x27;s pimp, who &quot;helps&quot; him pay off his drug debt. In public, he acts kindly towards Julian, calling him &quot;Julie&quot; and &quot;his best boy&quot; and often showing him off to his clients, but in private he abuses Julian emotionally and sexually and forces him to shoot up heroin.
; Clay&#x27;s family
: Clay has two sisters, aged 13 and 15, although his narration suggests he cannot distinguish between them and is unsure of their age. His parents are separated; his mother occupies their house while his father lives in an apartment. His mom has no job but nonetheless lives a life of off of her ex-husband&#x27;s large alimony payments, and his dad is &quot;in the film business&quot;, with an office in Century City. In flashbacks, Clay talks about his grandfather, proprietor of several hotels, and his grandmother, now deceased.

==Film adaptation==

The book &quot;Less than Zero&quot; was very loosely adapted into a movie in 1987 by 20th Century Fox. It starred Andrew McCarthy as Clay, Robert Downey Jr. as Julian, Jami Gertz as Blair, and James Spader as Rip. A then-unknown Brad Pitt also appeared as an extra. In the film, Clay is an anti-drug crusader who returns home from college to try to rescue his friends from their various narcotics addictions.

Due to all the liberties taken, Ellis refused to see the movie. In an interview, Ellis stated that he has warmed up to the movie, and appreciates it visually as a snapshot of a particular time. Ellis claimed that there was no connection between the book and the movie, except for the title, the location of Southern California and the names of the characters.

A long-running rumor in the film industry is that Quentin Tarantino has been interested in filming a new version of &quot;Less than Zero&quot;. His workmate Roger Avary adapted &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot; (also based on a novel by Ellis) in 2002, and since both he and Tarantino like the works by Ellis, Tarantino has been eyeing the possibility of adapting &quot;Less than Zero&quot;. Ellis stated in an interview for &quot;Vice&quot; magazine that Quentin Tarantino has been &quot;trying to get Fox to let him remake it.&quot; At a Q &amp; A at Harvard Book Store in 2012 Ellis stated in a reply to a question of whether &quot;Less than Zero&quot; will be remade that Tarantino &quot;has shown interest&quot; in adapting the story.

==TV adaptation==
On July 31, 2018, it was announced that Hulu had ordered a pilot for the series. Bret Easton Ellis was set to executive produce alongside Craig Wright, who was also the series developer, and Brett Morgan was set to direct the pilot. However, Hulu chose not to produce a series based on the pilot.

==Sequel==
Ellis announced in 2005 that he would be writing a sequel to &quot;Less than Zero&quot;: a story following the same characters, set in the present day, that focuses on their lives as they approach middle age.

In January 2008, Ellis announced that his forthcoming novel &quot;Imperial Bedrooms&quot; would be the sequel to &quot;Less than Zero&quot;. In keeping with the original, the title is taken from the title of an Elvis Costello record (both a 1982 album and song). The book was published in 2010.

==Reception==
The author stated in 2005:
Upon the release of &quot;Imperial Bedrooms&quot;, &quot;Details&quot; commented on &quot;Less than Zero&quot; and its original reviews, stating: &quot;Years ago people could have read some of your books and said, &#x27;Oh, this is just nihilism. These people don&#x27;t exist! There&#x27;s nobody that rich and stupid and narcissistic!. (The article states, &quot;When Michiko Kakutani first reviewed Less Than Zero in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in June of 1985, she began the review this way: &#x27;This is one of the most disturbing novels I&#x27;ve read in a long time.) Ellis remarks &quot;surprise!&quot;. They also credit him with &quot;In a way, [inventing] Paris Hilton and Spencer Pratt and the Kardashians.&quot;

<doc id="677886" wikidata="Q735657" url="?curid=677886" title="Pavonis Mons">
<text>Pavonis Mons (Latin for &quot;peacock mountain&quot;) is a large shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the middle member of a chain of three volcanic mountains (collectively known as the Tharsis Montes) that straddle the Martian equator between longitudes 235°E and 259°E. The volcano was discovered by the Mariner 9 spacecraft in 1971, and was originally called Middle Spot. Its name formally became Pavonis Mons in 1973. The equatorial location of its peak and its height make it the ideal terminus for a space elevator, and it has often been proposed as a space elevator location, especially in science fiction. It is also an ideal location for a Sky Ramp.

==General description==
Pavonis Mons stands at the southern edge of the Tharsis quadrangle - approximately 400 km southwest of Ascraeus Mons (the northernmost of the Tharsis Montes) and 400 km northeast of Arsia Mons (the southernmost member of the chain). The Tharsis Montes volcanoes lie along the crest of a northeast-trending rise (Tharsis bulge) that extends more than 3,000 km across the western equatorial region of Mars. Olympus Mons, the tallest volcano in the Solar System lies at the edge of the Tharsis bulge, about 1,200 km northwest of Pavonis Mons.

Pavonis Mons is the smallest of the Tharsis Montes volcanoes, measuring about 375 km across and standing 14 km above Mars&#x27; mean surface level. As a shield volcano, Pavonis Mons has an extremely low profile with flank slopes that average only 4°. The summit contains a deep, circular caldera that is 47 km in diameter and almost 5 km deep. A larger, shallower depression lies immediately northeast of the smaller caldera. The large depression is about 90 km in diameter and structurally more complex than the small caldera.

Like most of the Tharsis region, Pavonis Mons has a high albedo (reflectivity) and low thermal inertia, indicating that the volcano and surrounding areas are covered with large amounts of fine dust (see Martian surface). The dust forms a mantle over the surface that obscures or mutes much of the fine-scale topography and geology of the region. Tharsis is probably dusty because of its high elevations. The summit experiences an atmospheric pressure of around 130 Pa (1.3 mbar), about 21% of Mars&#x27; mean surface pressure. The atmospheric density is too low to mobilize and remove dust once it is deposited.

==Geology==
The bulk of the volcano&#x27;s surface consists of lava flows of the early Amazonian age. The northern flanks of the volcano are highly faulted with grabens and normal faults concentric to the volcano&#x27;s summit caldera. To its lower east flank, there is a chain of elliptical, or oval-shaped, pits, lined up down the center of a shallow trough. These features were formed by faulting and associated collapse; the scarp on each side of the trough is a fault line.

===Glaciers===
Using MGS and Odyssey data, combined with developments in the study of glaciers, scientists suggest that glaciers once existed on Pavonis Mons and probably still do to some extent. Evidence for this includes concentric ridges (moraines &quot;dropped&quot; by glaciers), a knobby area (caused by ice sublimating), and a smooth section that flows over other deposits (debris-covered glacial ice). The ice could have been deposited when the tilt of Mars changed the climate, thereby causing more moisture to be present in the atmosphere. Studies suggest the glaciation happened in the Late Amazonian period, the most recent period in Mars chronology. Multiple stages of glaciation probably occurred. The ice present today represents one more resource for possible future colonization of the planet.

===Possible evidence of plate tectonics===
Pavonis Mons is the middle of three volcanos (collectively known as Tharsis Montes) on the Tharsis bulge near the equator of the planet Mars. The other Tharsis volcanoes are Ascraeus Mons and Arsia Mons. The three Tharsis Montes, together with some smaller volcanoes to the north, form a fairly straight line. It has been proposed that this straight line of volcanoes is the result of the sort of plate motion which on Earth makes chains of &quot;hot spot&quot; volcanoes.

==In popular culture==
* Pavonis Mons provides the putative setting for the song &quot;Approaching Pavonis Mons by Balloon (Utopia Planitia)&quot; by The Flaming Lips, released as part of the album &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots&quot;.
* In Kim Stanley Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Mars Trilogy&quot;, Mars&#x27;s space elevator has its base on the southern rim of Pavonis – the highest place on the equator – and the city of Sheffield is built around it.
* Pavonis Mons is also the base of Mars&#x27;s space elevator in the GURPS Transhuman Space roleplaying game setting. The city of New Shanghai, the largest on Mars, is built around the elevator. Deimos is used as the anchor, having been shifted from its current orbit. Pavonis Mons also hosts a space elevator in other GURPS settings, including GURPS Mars.
* Pavonis Mons hosts a space elevator to Deimos in the &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot; franchise.
* Pavonis Mons is the name of a Settlement Defense Front destroyer in the game Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare in the mission &quot;Operation Deep Execute&quot;, Captain Khosi Siyada was the ship&#x27;s commander.

<doc id="677888" wikidata="Q1534482" url="?curid=677888" title="Later Yan">
<text>Yan, known in historiography as the Later Yan (; 384 – 407 or 409), was a dynastic state of China ruled by the Xianbei people during the era of Sixteen Kingdoms.

The prefix &quot;Later&quot; to distinguish them from the Former Yan before them and other Yan states from the period. Historiographers also consider the Former Yan and Later Yan as separate states despite both being ruled by the same imperial family, and the Later Yan&#x27;s founder, Murong Chui, had intended his state to be a restoration. Due to the devastation inflicted on the old Yan capital, Ye, the city of Zhongshan (中山, in modern Baoding, Hebei) became the first capital of the Later Yan. The Later Yan managed to recover most of their old territory in Liaoning, Hebei, Shaanxi, Shandong and Henan by 394. However, after the Northern Wei invasion in 396, they were reduced to Liaoning and parts of northeastern Hebei, where they made Longcheng their new capital. Their territory was further reduced during their war with Goguryeo as they lost the Liaodong Peninsula.

The Later Yan rulers initially declared themselves &quot;emperors&quot;, but towards the end they adopted the lesser title of &quot;Tiān Wáng&quot; (Heavenly King). Some historians consider Murong Xi the last ruler of Later Yan, while others consider it to be Gao Yun, an adopted member of the imperial family of Goguryeo ethnicity.

== History ==

=== Background ===
Murong Chui was the son of Murong Huang, the founder of the Xianbei Former Yan dynasty, and a key military general; in 369, he saved the state from ruin by defeating an Eastern Jin invasion led by Huan Wen at the Battle of Fangtou. On the other hand, he was also a subject of suspicion within the imperial family. After defeating Huan Wen, the regent, his uncle Murong Ping became apprehensive of his newfound reputation and wanted to kill him, prompting Chui to flee to the Di-led Former Qin dynasty.

In the next few years, Qin conquered Yan and reunified northern China. Although Qin&#x27;s ruler, Fu Jian treated him favourably, Chui harboured ambitions to restore his state. He fought for Qin in campaigns against the Eastern Jin and was one of the few officials who supported the ill-fated invasion of 383, which saw the Qin&#x27;s disastrous defeat at the Battle of Fei River. As Chui&#x27;s army remained mostly intact after the battle, he escorted the injured Fu Jian back to the north.

Sensing weakness, Chui began carrying out his restoration, but rather than kill Fu Jian, he requested to be transferred to Hebei, where Former Yan once ruled, ostensibly to maintain order in the region. There, he cooperated with Fu Jian&#x27;s son, Fu Pi, under mutual suspicion while secretly contacting the old Yan families and officials to join his movement. In 384, the Dingling people led by Zhai Bin rebelled around Luoyang. Fu Pi sent Chui to attack them, but during the campaign, Chui finally rebelled, joining forces with Zhai Bin.

=== Restoring the Yan ===
Initially, Murong Chui only took the title of Prince of Yan, as the last Former Yan emperor, Murong Wei, was still alive at the Qin capital, Chang&#x27;an. To distinguish between Former Yan and other Yan states of the period, historiographers refer to Chui&#x27;s state as the Later Yan. He led his forces to besiege Fu Pi at Ye while his generals secured the rest of Hebei. Unlike the Former Yan dynasty, the upper echelons of the Later Yan were dominated by the Xianbei clans rather than Han Chinese. The Later Yan also had to cooperate with the various fortified settlements (塢堡; wubao) in the northeast, who were typically led by the non-Chinese and had a large degree of autonomy over their strongholds.

Soon after Chui&#x27;s rebellion, the Western Yan and Later Qin also broke away around Chang&#x27;an, constraining Fu Jian and preventing him from sending aid to the east. Despite rebelling, Chui upheld a framing of still being indebted to Fu Jian. While besieging Ye, he attempted to assure Fu Pi&#x27;s safety and allowed him an escape route to the west. Members of the Fu clan that surrendered were also welcomed and allowed to serve under him.

The battle for Ye lasted around a year as Fu Pi held firmly to the city. During this time, the Zhai-Dingling rebelled and Chui had to fight a brief alliance between Qin and Jin. The war in Hebei and famines that accompanied it devastated the region&#x27;s economy, but Fu Pi finally abandoned Ye for Jinyang in late 385. Later Yan captured the city, and at this point had occupied most of Hebei.

=== Wars with Zhai Wei and Western Yan ===
In 386, Murong Chui made Zhongshan (中山, in modern Baoding, Hebei) his capital, as the city underwent significant development during the war. Later that year, his cousin, Murong Yong of Western Yan occupied Shanxi and declared himself emperor. By now, both Murong Wei and Fu Jian had died, so Chui also changed his title to emperor. The Dingling rebels under Zhai Liao founded the Zhai Wei state at Huatai (滑台, in modern Anyang, Henan) in 388. Rebellions frequently broke out in Yan territory, and the Yan was in a constant state of warfare.

In 392, Murong Chui campaigned against and destroyed Zhai Wei. In 394, seeking to establish Later Yan as Former Yan&#x27;s true successor, Chui began a campaign to conquer Western Yan. He captured the Western Yan capital and executed Murong Yong, annexing Shanxi for Later Yan. Then, he sent his generals to capture Shandong from the Eastern Jin dynasty, bringing the state to its peak.

At this point, Murong Chui was already at an advanced age, and so he began empowering his Crown Prince, Murong Bao. In 388, he assigned Bao to run the government from Zhongshan while still retaining his decision-making power on important matters. Chui also introduced a separate governing system between his Han Chinese and &quot;Hu&quot; subjects within Yan by appointing Bao the Grand Chanyu, tasked with supervising the tribes. This system was further developed during the reign of Murong Sheng, who established the Yan Ministry to manage the tribes, and then Murong Xi, who set up the Grand Chanyu Administration.

=== War with Northern Wei ===
Previously in 386, to counter Western Yan, Later Yan allied themselves with the Tuoba-Xianbei state of Northern Wei. Initially, Wei relied on Later Yan&#x27;s assistance against their rival tribes, but an incident in 391 led to relations breaking down. Wei aligned themselves with Western Yan, and hostilities continued even after Western Yan fell. In 395, to further elevate his Crown Prince, he sent Murong Bao to lead a force of around 90,000 strong on a punitive expedition against Wei, but the campaign ended in disaster as the Yan was heavily routed at the Battle of Canhe Slope, with Bao barely escaping with his life. In 396, Murong Chui personally led a campaign against Wei, but despite early success, became extremely ill and was forced to withdraw. He soon died and was succeeded by Murong Bao.

Bao&#x27;s rule was immediately troubled by conflict between him and his family members, along with his sudden and unpopular attempt at rectifying the state&#x27;s household registry. Shortly after Bao&#x27;s ascension, the Wei ruler, Tuoba Gui invaded Yan. Bao concentrated his forces to Zhongshan and other major cities, believing that Wei would besiege them and withdraw once their supply ran out. Instead, Wei forces quickly overran the Central Plains and consolidated their rule over captured territory. When a rebellion broke out near the Wei capital, Gui negotiated peace, but Bao refused to accept it. He attacked the Wei army as they prepare to retreat, but the Yan army was severely defeated at the Battle of Baisi.

After the loss at Baisi, Bao&#x27;s brother, Murong Lin started a coup in Zhongshan but failed and escaped the city. Worried that Lin may occupy the key city of Longcheng, Bao decided to abandon Zhongshan for Longcheng. Hereafter, more infighting ensued; at Longcheng, Bao survived rebellions by his son, Murong Hui and his general Duan Sugu (段速骨). Meanwhile, at Zhongshan, a cousin, Murong Xiang held out against Wei and declared himself emperor, but was soon killed and replaced by Murong Lin. However, Zhongshan then fell to Wei, and Lin fled to Ye, where he convinced his uncle, Murong De to abandon the city for Huatai. There, De declared himself the Prince of Yan in 398, founding the Southern Yan and splitting the state into two.

=== Rule from Liaoning ===
Supplanted by the Northern Wei, the Later Yan ceased to be a major player on the Central Plains as their territory was reduced to present-day Liaoning. In 398, Murong Bao was assassinated by his granduncle, Lan Han, who was then killed by Bao&#x27;s son, Murong Sheng, shortly after. Sheng demoted his imperial title from Emperor to Commoner Heavenly King in 400. He had success in waging war against the Kumo Xi and Goguryeo but was also very strict and suspicious of his own officials. In 401, he was killed during a coup, and his uncle Murong Xi replaced him as Heavenly King.

Murong Xi is described in records as a remarkably cruel and wasteful ruler, acting on the whims of his lovers, the sisters Fu Song&#x27;e and Fu Xunying. Xi engaged in several costly construction projects and launched repeated campaigns against the Khitan and Goguryeo. However, he was largely unsuccessful in his campaigns, even losing Liaodong to Goguryeo in 404. Taking advantage of Fu Xunying&#x27;s funeral in 407, Murong Bao&#x27;s adopted son, Murong Yun, launched a coup and killed Murong Xi.

Murong Yun was originally named Gao Yun and a descendant of the Goguryeo royal family. Upon ascending, he changed his name back to Gao Yun. Depending on one&#x27;s interpretation, he was either the last ruler of Later Yan or the first ruler of a separate regime known as the Northern Yan (hence, Later Yan ending with Murong Xi&#x27;s death in 407). Gao Yun established friendly relations with Goguryeo before he was assassinated in 409. His Han Chinese general, Feng Ba replaced him on the throne, thus ending the Later Yan and beginning the Northern Yan.

<text>Ascraeus Mons is a large shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the northernmost and tallest of three shield volcanoes collectively known as the Tharsis Montes.

==Discovery==
The volcano&#x27;s location corresponds to the classical albedo feature Ascraeus Lacus.

Ascraeus Mons was discovered by the Mariner 9 spacecraft in 1971. The volcano was originally called North Spot because it was the northernmost of only four spots visible on the surface due to a global dust storm that was then enshrouding the planet. As the dust cleared, the spots were revealed to be extremely tall volcanoes whose summits had projected above the dust-laden, lower atmosphere.

==Name==
Ascraeus Lacus had been named after Ascra, the rustic birthplace of Hesiod; in Greek, the word &quot;ascraeus&quot; is a poetic metonym for &quot;rural.&quot;
The volcano&#x27;s name officially became Ascraeus Mons in 1973.

==General description==
The volcano is located in the southeast-central portion of the Tharsis quadrangle at 11.8°N, 255.5°E in Mars&#x27; western hemisphere. A group of three smaller volcanoes (the Ceraunius-Uranius group) lies about 700 km to the northeast, and Pavonis Mons (the middle volcano of the Tharsis Montes) lies 500 km to the southwest. The 70-km diameter crater Poynting is located 300 km to the west-southwest.

Ascraeus Mons is roughly 480 km in diameter and is the second highest mountain on Mars, with a summit elevation of 18.1 km. The volcano has a very low profile with an average flank slope of 7°. Slopes are steepest in the middle portion of the flanks, flattening out toward the base and near the top where a broad summit plateau and caldera (collapse crater) complex are located.

Volcanic vents, located on the northeastern and southwestern edges of the volcano, are sources for broad lava aprons, or fans, that bury nearby portions of the volcano and extend over 100 km out into the surrounding plains. The southwest–northeast orientation of the aprons matches the orientation of the Tharsis Montes, suggesting that a major fissure or rift in the Martian crust is responsible for the orientation of both the aprons and the Tharsis Montes chain. The presence of the lava aprons causes some disagreement in the actual dimensions of the volcano. If the aprons are included as part of the edifice then Ascraeus Mons has dimensions closer to 375 × 870 km.

Like most of the Tharsis region, Ascraeus Mons has a high albedo (reflectivity) and low thermal inertia, indicating that the volcano and surrounding areas are covered with large amounts of fine dust. (See the Martian Surface.) The dust forms a mantle over the surface that obscures or mutes much of the fine-scale topography and geology of the region. Tharsis is probably dusty because of its high elevations. The atmospheric density is too low to mobilize and remove dust once it is deposited. The atmospheric pressure at the summit of Ascraeus Mons averages 100 pascal (1.0 mbar); this is only 17% of the average surface pressure of 600 pascal.

Ascraeus Mons is surrounded by lava flow plains that are mid to late Amazonian in age. The elevation of the plains averages about 3 km above datum (Martian &quot;sea&quot; level), giving the volcano an average vertical relief of 15 km. However, the elevation of the plains varies considerably. The plains northwest of the volcano are less than 2 km in elevation. The plains are highest (&gt;3 km) southeast of the volcano.

The lava plains northwest of Ascraeus Mons are notable for having two dark collapse pits photographed by the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) in November 2010 (pictured in gallery below). The pits resemble those imaged around Arsia Mons by the Mars Odyssey spacecraft. The two pits measure about 180 and 310 m wide, and the larger pit is approximately 180 meters deep. The eastern walls of the pits consist of steep, overhanging ledges. The bottoms of both pits contain sediments and large boulders. These rimless pit craters are believed to form by collapse of surface material into a subsurface void created either by a dike or lava tube. They are analogous to volcanic pit craters on Earth, such as the Devil&#x27;s Throat crater on the upper east rift zone of Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii. In some cases, they may mark skylights/entrances to subsurface lava caves.

==Geology==
Ascraeus Mons was built by many thousands of fluid basaltic lava flows. Except for its great size, it resembles terrestrial shield volcanoes like those that form the Hawaiian Islands. The flanks of Ascraeus Mons are covered with narrow, lobate lava flows and lava channels. Many of the lava flows have levees along their margins. Levees are parallel ridges formed at the edges of lava flows. The cooler, outer margins of the flow solidify, leaving a central trough of molten, flowing lava. Partially collapsed lava tubes are visible as chains of pit craters.

By examining the morphologies of lava flow structures on Ascraeus Mons, geologists are able to calculate the rheological properties of the lava and estimate the rate at which it poured out during eruption (effusion rate). Results show that the lava was highly fluid (low viscosity) with low yield strength, resembling Hawaiian and Icelandic basaltic lavas. Average effusion rates are about 185 m3/s. These rates are comparable to those seen in Hawaii and Iceland. Earth-based radar studies show that Ascraeus Mons has a higher radar echo strength than other volcanic structures on the planet. This could indicate that the lava flows on the flanks of Ascraeus Mons consist of rough Aā-type flows, a conclusion supported by photogeologic analysis of lava flow morphologies.
The flanks of Ascraeus Mons have a rumpled appearance caused by numerous low, rounded terrace-like structures arranged concentrically around the summit of the volcano. The terraces are spaced 30 to 50 km apart, have lengths up to 100 km, radial widths of 30 km, and heights of about 3 km. Individual terraces are not continuous around the volcano, but instead consist of arcuate segments that overlap with each other, forming an imbricate pattern. They are interpreted to be the surface expression of thrust faults that formed due to compression along the volcano&#x27;s flanks. Flank terraces are also common on Olympus Mons and the other Tharsis shield volcanoes. The source of the compressive stresses is still debated. The flank terraces may be due to compressional failure of the volcano, flexing of the underlying lithosphere due to the volcano&#x27;s massive weight, cycles of magma chamber inflation and deflation, or shallow gravitational slumping.
Fissures, or flank vents, at the southwestern and northeastern edges of the volcano are the sources of the lava aprons that spread out across the surrounding plains. The fissures seem to have formed by the merger of numerous, narrow rille-like depressions. In places, the depressions form sinuous channels with islands and other features suggestive of erosion by a fluid. Whether the channels were formed predominately by water or lava is still a topic of debate, though extensive study of analogous environments (e.g. Hawaii, the Moon, elsewhere on Mars) and morphologic features by multiple researchers has led to the conclusion that a volcanic origin is most probable.

The caldera complex consists of a central caldera surrounded by four coalesced calderas. The central caldera measures about 24 km across and 3.4 km deep and is the youngest of the collapse structures. Crater counting indicates that the central caldera is about 100 million years (Myr) old. The surrounding calderas have ages of about 200, 400, and 800 Myr old, or earlier. A small, partly preserved depression southeast of the main caldera may be as old as 3.8 billion years (Gyr). If the dates are valid, then Ascraeus Mons may have been active through most of Mars&#x27; history.

An area of peculiar, fan-shaped deposits (FSD) lies on the volcano&#x27;s western flank. The FSD consists of a zone of knobby terrain outlined by a semicircular zone of concentric ridges. Similar deposits are also found at the northwestern edges of the other two Tharsis Montes, Pavonis Mons and Arsia Mons, as well as on Olympus Mons. The FSD at Ascraeus Mons is the smallest of those on the Tharsis Montes, covering an area of 14,000 km2 and extending outward from the volcano&#x27;s base for about 100 km. The origin of these deposits has been debated for decades. However, recent geologic evidence suggests that FSDs are deposits left by glaciers, which covered portions of the volcanoes during a recent period of high obliquity. During periods of high obliquity (axial tilt) the polar regions receive higher levels of sunlight. More water from the poles enters the atmosphere and condenses as ice or snowfall in the cooler equatorial regions. Mars changes its obliquity from about 15° to 35° in cycles of 120,000 years.

<doc id="677892" wikidata="Q704936" url="?curid=677892" title="Arsia Mons">
<text>Arsia Mons is the southernmost of three volcanoes (collectively known as Tharsis Montes) on the Tharsis bulge near the equator of the planet Mars. To its north is Pavonis Mons, and north of that is Ascraeus Mons. The tallest volcano in the Solar System, Olympus Mons, is to its northwest. Its name comes from a corresponding albedo feature on a map by Giovanni Schiaparelli, which he named in turn after the legendary Roman forest of Arsia Silva. Historically, it was known as Nodus Gordii (&quot;Gordian knot&quot;) before being renamed.

==Structure==

Arsia Mons is a shield volcano with a relatively low slope and a massive caldera at its summit. The southernmost of the three Tharsis Montes volcanoes, it is the only major Tharsis volcano south of the equator.

The volcano is in diameter, almost high (more than higher than the surrounding plains), and the summit caldera is 110 km (72 miles) wide. It experiences atmospheric pressure lower than 107 pascals at the summit. Excluding Olympus Mons, it is the largest known volcano in terms of volume. Arsia Mons has 30 times the volume of Mauna Loa in Hawaii, the largest volcano on the Earth.

The caldera of Arsia Mons was formed when the mountain collapsed in on itself after its reservoir of magma was exhausted. There are many other geologic collapse features on the mountain&#x27;s flanks. The caldera floor formed around 150 Mya ago.

The shield is transected roughly northeast to southwest by a set of collapse features. The collapse features on the shield are connected by a line of small shield volcanoes on the floor of the caldera. It is possible that this line represents a significant fault similar to others found on the Tharsis bulge. This fault may represent the source of the Arsia lavas.

The rift area to the southwest has been imaged in significant detail by the European Space Agency probe Mars Express. In 2004, a 3D map of this region was created at high resolution. Cliffs, landslides, and numerous collapse features can be seen in this detailed image. Combined with the extensive lava flows at the termination of the rift, this may reveal areas that drained the caldera lavas and contributed to the collapse.

The northwest flank of the volcano is significantly different and rougher than the southeast flank, and the features may represent evidence of glaciers.

==Possible plate tectonics==

The three Tharsis Montes, together with some smaller volcanoes to the north, form a rather straight line. It has been proposed that these are the result of plate tectonics, which on Earth makes chains of &quot;hot spot&quot; volcanoes.

==History==
The most recent eruptive episode in the history of Arsia Mons, among the youngest on Mars, involved at least 29 vents within the caldera and also eruptions on the flank aprons along the north-south axis of the volcano. This activity is thought to have extended from 200–300 Ma to 10–90 Ma ago, peaking at 150 Ma with eruption rates in the caldera of 1–8 km3 per Ma. This low recent rate contrasts with an average rate of 270 km3/Ma over the volcano&#x27;s inferred entire 3400 Ma history.

==Weather==
A repeated weather phenomenon occurs each year near the start of southern winter over Arsia Mons. Just before southern winter begins, sunlight warms the air on the slopes of the volcano. On the leeward slope, water ice condenses, forming a cloud which can extend westward for more than 1000 km. The autumn of 2018 saw a particularly pronounced version of this orographic cloud, as the planet-wide dust storm finally subsided. The presence of some dust undoubtedly emphasised the phenomenon. This phenomenon has been repeatedly observed by the Mars Express orbiter.

A study using a global climate model found that the Medusae Fossae Formation could have been formed from ancient volcanic ash from Apollinaris Mons, Arsia Mons, and possibly Pavonis Mons.

==Glaciers==

Recent work provides evidence for glaciers on Arsia Mons at both high and low elevations. A series of parallel ridges resemble moraines dropped by glaciers. Another section looks as if ice melted under the ground and formed a knobby terrain. The lower part has lobes and seems to be flowing downhill. This lobed feature may still contain an ice core that is covered with a thin layer of rocks that has prevented ice from sublimating.

==Possible cave entrances==

As of 2007 seven putative cave entrances, have been identified in satellite imagery of the flanks of Arsia Mons. They have been informally dubbed Dena, Chloë, Wendy, Annie, Abbey, Nikki, and Jeanne and resemble &quot;skylights&quot; formed by the collapse of lava tube ceilings.

From day to night, temperatures of the circular features change only about one-third as much as the change in temperature of surrounding ground. While this is more variable than large caves on Earth, it is consistent with there being deep pits. However, due to the extreme altitude, it is unlikely that they will be able to harbour any form of Martian life.

A more recent photograph of one of the features shows sunlight illuminating a side wall, suggesting that it may simply be a vertical pit rather than an entrance to a larger underground space. Nonetheless, the darkness of this feature implies that it must be at least 178 meters deep.

<doc id="677893" wikidata="Q3357743" url="?curid=677893" title="Ottawa Centre (federal electoral district)">
<text>Ottawa Centre () is an urban federal electoral district in Ontario, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1968. While the riding&#x27;s boundaries (mainly to the south and west as the north and east borders have remained the Ottawa River and Rideau River, respectively) have changed over the years to account for population changes, the riding has always comprised the central areas of Ottawa, the nation&#x27;s capital.

The House of Commons of Canada meets in the West Block of the Parliament Buildings on Parliament Hill, which is located within this district.

==History==
The riding was created in 1966 from Carleton, Ottawa West and Ottawa East ridings. It initially consisted of that part of Ottawa north of the Rideau River, west of a line following the Rideau Canal to the Canadian Pacific Railway line (currently about where Nicholas Street is), and generally east of Bayswater Road (now Ave.), and south of that the CPR line where the O-Train currently is.
===1976 Federal Redistribution===

The 1976 redistribution saw significant changes to the riding. It lost territory around Mechanicsville (north of Wellington Street West, west of the current O-Train) and Old Ottawa East (north of Clegg St), while gaining all of the Civic Hospital and Hintonburg neighbourhoods east of Holland Avenue and south of Wellington, Carleton Heights, Riverside Park and the Hunt Club area west of the current O-Train line.
===1987 Federal Redistribution===

The 1987 redistribution saw the riding expand westward to Island Park Drive, while losing all of its territory south of the Rideau River. Additionally, the riding gained back all of Old Ottawa East south of The Queensway.
===1996 Federal Redistribution===

The 1996 redistribution saw the riding expand further westward to Sherbourne Road / Maitland Avenue north of the Queensway, as well as gaining the eastern half of Carlington (east of Merivale Road). Also, the area of Old Ottawa East north of the Queensway was added back to the riding.
===2003 Federal Redistribution===

The riding did not change its boundaries in 2003.

===2012 Federal Redistribution===

Following the Canadian federal electoral redistribution, 2012, there was a minor change in the riding&#x27;s southwestern boundary, which was moved from the former city limits to Baseline Road and Fisher Avenue.

===2022 Federal Redistribution===
The &quot;2022 Federal Redistribution&quot; has become law and will be in effect for the next Federal election which must be held no later than 2025.

Several neighbourhoods in the west end of the riding were moved to Ottawa West—Nepean following the 2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution. North of the Queensway the western boundary was moved from &quot;Maitland Ave&quot; and &quot;Sherbourne Rd&quot; east to &quot;Golden Ave&quot; and then along &quot;Carling Ave&quot;. As a result the neighbourhoods of McKellar Park and McKellar Heights were shifted to &quot;Ottawa West—Nepean&quot;.

The south-west boundary along &quot;Merivale Rd&quot; was moved east to &quot;Fisher Ave&quot;, reallocating the entire Carlington neighbourhood to &quot;Ottawa West—Nepean&quot; (previously the eastern portion of &quot;Carlington&quot; was within &quot;Ottawa Centre&quot;).

This was somewhat compensated for by changes in the riding&#x27;s southern boundary, which pushed south and east of the &quot;Rideau River&quot; for the first time following &quot;Bank St&quot; and the railway line north of &quot;Heron Rd&quot;. This change affects the neighbourhoods of Riverside Park, Billings Bridge and Heron Park which are in future part of &quot;Ottawa Centre&quot; and not Ottawa South.

===Members of Parliament===
The riding was won in the 1984 election by New Democrat Mike Cassidy. The riding was subsequently won by Liberal Mac Harb in the 1988 election who held it until 2003 when he was appointed to the Senate. The riding was left vacant by Prime Minister Paul Martin until the 2004 election when Ed Broadbent, a former leader of the NDP, defeated Liberal Richard Mahoney, a high-profile lawyer and Liberal strategist and long-time ally of former Prime Minister Paul Martin. The other candidates in 2004 were Mike Murphy of the Conservatives, David Chernushenko of the Greens, Louis Lang of the Marxist-Leninists, Michael Foster, Stuart Ryan of the Communists, Robert Gauthier, and Carla Marie Dancey. Paul Dewar, son of former Ottawa mayor, Marion Dewar, held the riding from 2006 until 2015. Notably, Dewar won the riding with 52 percent of ballots cast in the 2011 federal election.

Ottawa Centre is represented in the House of Commons of Canada by Yasir Naqvi from the Liberal Party of Canada.







==Geography==
The riding covers most of downtown Ottawa, including the Parliament Buildings. From the Rideau River, the riding stretches west encompassing the neighbourhoods of Downtown, Centretown (Centretown West which includes Little Italy is usually considered a distinct neighbourhood), LeBreton Flats, Civic Hospital, Mechanicsville, Hintonburg, Wellington Village, Westboro, eastern part of Carlington, Highland Park, and McKellar Park. The riding encompasses additional neighbourhoods south of downtown, including The Glebe, Old Ottawa South, Lees Avenue, Old Ottawa East and others.

Many public sector workers live in the riding. The northern part of the riding contains many government office buildings, including Parliament Hill. The riding also includes Carleton University and Saint Paul University&#x27;s (where many UOttawa students have residence) campuses and residences.

==Demographics==
:&quot;According to the 2021 Canadian census&quot;

Ethnic groups: 72.4% White, 5.5% Black, 4.5% Chinese, 4.1% South Asian, 3.8% Indigenous, 2.4% Arab, 1.7% Southeast Asian, 1.4% Latin American, 1.0% West Asian
Languages: 67.0% English, 9.1% French, 1.9% Arabic, 1.8% Mandarin, 1.5% Spanish, 1.1% Cantonese, 1.1% Italian
Religions: 42.2% Christian (22.9% Catholic, 4.4% Anglican, 3.4% United Church, 1.8% Christian Orthodox, 1.0% Presbyterian, 8.7% Other), 4.8% Muslim, 2.0% Jewish, 1.4% Hindu, 1.3% Buddhist, 46.9% None 
Median income: $54,800 (2020) 
Average income: $77,800 (2020)

The Ottawa Centre riding has the highest percentage of master&#x27;s degree holders in all of Canada (12.7%)

In the 2015 election, the riding had the highest turnout in the country with just over 82% of electors casting a ballot in the election.

==Election results==
===2021 federal election===


===2019 federal election===
Still holding the Cabinet post of Environment Minister, Ms McKenna was challenged by a new NDP candidate, Emilie Taman, along with other challengers Carol Clemenhagen for the Conservative Party, Angela Keller-Herzog for the Green Party, and Merylee Sevilla for the People&#x27;s Party. Ms McKenna gained over 4,000 votes from the previous election in 2015, beating her nearest rival by over 15,000 votes.

===2015 federal election===
Ottawa Centre lost a sliver of territory to Ottawa West—Nepean, as its southwestern border moved from the former Ottawa City limits to Fisher Avenue and Baseline Road. The total population of this area lost (2011 Census) was 424.

Ottawa Centre saw the highest turnout in the entire country in the 2015 election.






===2011 federal election===






===2008 federal election===

===2006 federal election===
Broadbent announced in 2005 that he would not run for re-election so he could devote more time to care for his ailing wife, Lucille. Richard Mahoney was again the Liberal candidate, hoping that, without an opposing star candidate, such as Broadbent, he would be elected this time. The NDP nominated Paul Dewar, a teacher and son of former mayor Marion Dewar. As the Liberal national numbers declined over the course of the campaign, it seemed more likely that the NDP could retain the seat. Mahoney went on the offensive late in the campaign, claiming a vote for Paul Dewar would help the Conservatives. Dewar retained most of Broadbent&#x27;s voters and won by over 5000 votes. The riding also gave the Green Party of Canada one of its best performances nationwide with over 6,500 votes, over 10%.
2006 nomination contests



===2004 federal election===

The 2004 election was an unusual campaign in Ottawa Centre. The seat was vacated in September 2003 when Liberal incumbent Mac Harb received his patronage appointment to the Senate of Canada from outgoing Prime Minister Jean Chrétien. Paul Martin loyalist Richard Mahoney won the Liberal nomination and expected to win the riding.

Former NDP leader and widely respected statesman Ed Broadbent came out of political retirement to win the NDP nomination in January. As the seat was vacant, a by-election was expected to fill the seat and campaigning began in early 2004. However, Prime Minister Paul Martin delayed calling the by-election, in the expectation that a general election would soon be called.

In May 2004, a federal election was called, pre-empting the by-election. Broadbent was increasingly favoured to win, a mid-campaign poll showed him ahead. In addition to Broadbent&#x27;s personal popularity, the NDP under new leader Jack Layton had greatly increased its popularity, especially in urban Ontario. The campaign was still hard-fought. In the end, Broadbent won a strong victory, and subsequently announced his retirement the following year, in April 2005.

<doc id="677899" wikidata="Q11449356" url="?curid=677899" title="Space vehicle">
<text>A space vehicle is the combination of a spacecraft and its launch vehicle which carries it into space. The earliest space vehicles were expendable launch systems, using a single or multistage rocket to carry a relatively small spacecraft in proportion to the total vehicle size and mass. An early exception to this, the Space Shuttle, consisted of a reusable orbital vehicle carrying crew and payload, supported by an expendable external propellant tank and two reusable solid-fuel booster rockets.

Reusable launch systems are currently being developed by private industry.

Early spacecraft or space vehicles were sometimes known as &quot;spaceships&quot;, a term which comes from science fiction to designate a hypothetical vehicle which travels beyond low Earth orbit and is 100% reusable, needing only to be refueled like an airplane.

==History==
In the 1865 Jules Verne novel &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, successful attempts are made to launch three people in a projectile with the goal of a Moon landing. In 1880, &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot; described Verne’s &quot;Columbiad&quot; as a &quot;space-ship&quot; — the first recorded use of this term.

The concept of a &quot;space ship&quot; (or &quot;rocket ship&quot;) was further developed in twentieth century science fiction such as &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, as a self-contained, presumably rocket-powered, unitized vehicle capable of reaching an extraterrestrial destination keeping its structure intact, and requiring only refueling, like an airplane. Real-world rocket technology did not make this possible; while the airplane requires an amount of fuel occupying a relatively small fraction of the total size and mass, the rocket requires an oxidizer in order to operate in the vacuum of space. It also cannot use atmospheric air as its propellant; this function is served by the high-volume and high-mass fuel and oxidizer. Also, the high amount of energy required to reach at least low Earth orbital speed requires an extremely high proportion of propellant to dry vehicle mass. Also, mid-twentieth century structural technologies made it impossible to construct a single set of propellant tanks capable of holding enough mass to reach the required velocity. Thus, expendable multi-stage launch vehicles were the necessary design choice when spaceflight began in the late 1950s. However, starting in the 1990s, developmental work began on such unitary single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) space vehicles with projects like X-33, Roton, McDonnell Douglas DC-X, and Skylon. By 2020, most SSTO developmental projects had failed with the exception of Skylon, which continues development.

==Current space vehicles==
A majority of space vehicles currently in use are expendable, designed to carry a single payload into space but not for recovery and reuse. They typically consist of several stages which detach in sequence as the vehicle gains speed and altitude and propellant is exhausted.

Reusable launch systems are capable of launching multiple payloads and can be recovered after each use. The only fully reusable space vehicles currently in use are New Shepard and SpaceShipTwo. Both of them perform suborbital spaceflights. SpaceX is developing their Starship to be a fully reusable orbital space vehicle.

<text>Bayside is an American punk rock band from the Bayside, Queens, neighborhood of New York City, formed in 2000 by lead vocalist Anthony Raneri. The group also consists of lead guitarist Jack O&#x27;Shea, bassist Nick Ghanbarian, and drummer Chris Guglielmo.

Since their formation, the group has released nine full-length albums, with their debut, &quot;Sirens and Condolences&quot;, in 2004, and the release of 2005&#x27;s follow-up, &quot;Bayside&quot;, launching the band into mainstream success. The band released seven more albums: &quot;The Walking Wounded&quot; (2007), &quot;Shudder&quot; (2008), &quot;Killing Time&quot; (2011), &quot;Cult&quot; (2014), &quot;Vacancy&quot; (2016), &quot;Interrobang&quot; (2019) and &quot;There Are Worse Things Than Being Alive&quot; (2024).

==History==
===Early years and debut album (2000–04)===
Bayside was formed by Anthony Raneri, Vinny Daraio, Chris Jackson (formerly of the Showoffs and Waste Management), and Mike Kozak in October 2000 in Queens, New York City. The band got its name when on their way to a Drive-Thru Records showcase on Long Island featuring New Found Glory, with the intention of giving New Found Glory a demo CD, and they were trying to think of a name to write on the CD. They passed the Bayside train station, and decided to write &quot;Bayside&quot; on the CD, which stuck. The group self-released a five-song demo and signed to Dying Wish Records to issue their first release, &quot;Long Stories Short&quot; EP in 2001. In early 2002, the band toured with the likes of My Hotel Year, Don&#x27;t Look Down, A440, Brand New, and Hot Rod Circuit.

In June 2002, Kozak left the band and was replaced by JR Manning of Caroline. In October 2002, the band supported Shelter for two weeks on their headlining US tour, before spending November and December touring with Unsung Zeros and Junction 18, and two weeks with the Rocking Horse Winner and Twothirtyeight. In March 2003, the band released a split EP with Name Taken, through Dying Wish Records. It was promoted with an east coast US tour with the Goodwill and Junction 18 in April and May 2003. Later in 2003, Bayside signed to Victory Records, where the band resided for the next six years. Bayside&#x27;s debut full-length album, &quot;Sirens and Condolences&quot;, was released on January 27, 2004, through Victory Records.

===Self-titled album and &quot;Acoustic&quot; EP (2004–06)===
The band&#x27;s self-titled follow-up album, &quot;Bayside&quot;, was released on August 23, 2005, by Victory Records. While touring in support of the album, the band was involved in a van accident on October 31, 2005, at 3 AM in Cheyenne, Wyoming. After leaving their Boulder, Colorado show, their vehicle hit a patch of ice, skidded off the road, and flipped over. Drummer John &quot;Beatz&quot; Holohan, age 31, was killed, and bassist Nick Ghanbarian was seriously injured when he was ejected through one of the van&#x27;s windows. Ghanbarian broke his L-4 lumbar vertebrae, which required surgery, while bandmates Anthony Raneri and Jack O&#x27;Shea escaped with minor injuries.

Bayside released &quot;Acoustic&quot;, a collection of acoustic versions of their songs which featured the song &quot;Winter&quot;, a tribute to Holohan. The band Punchline dedicated their album &quot;37 Everywhere&quot; to the memory of Holohan. The first song on the record, &quot;Flashlight,&quot; features backing vocals from Raneri, and the song &quot;They Are Strong Hands&quot; is a reference to Bayside&#x27;s song &quot;They Looked Like Strong Hands&quot; from their self-titled album. &quot;They Are Strongs Hands&quot; also makes a lyrical shout out to Holohan saying &quot;Ain&#x27;t nobody gonna bring me down, &#x27;cause my boy John Beatz got my back.&quot; Several other bands wrote songs dedicated to his memory, including Aiden, I Am the Avalanche, Silverstein, and The Sleeping.

===&quot;The Walking Wounded&quot; and &quot;Shudder&quot; (2006–09)===
The band released &quot;The Walking Wounded&quot; on February 6, 2007, and was re-released as &quot;The Walking Wounded: Gold Edition&quot; on July 22, 2007, with the newer edition containing bonus live acoustic tracks as well as a bonus DVD, which includes live acoustic recordings, music videos, and documentaries. The drums and percussion on the album were performed by Chris Guglielmo, who joined the band as their new drummer after the death of John Holohan. A remix of the song &quot;Duality&quot; was featured in the soundtrack to &quot;Resident Evil: Extinction&quot;.

On September 30, 2008, the band released its fourth full-length album, &quot;Shudder&quot;, and a live album, &quot;Live at the Bayside Social Club&quot;. The album had been leaked onto various file-sharing sites earlier in the month on September 5, 2008. A week before the official release on September 22, 2008, the album was put up to stream on the band&#x27;s official MySpace page. On October 4, 2008, the music video for the song &quot;No One Understands&quot; was posted for viewing on the band&#x27;s official MySpace page.

===&quot;Killing Time&quot; (2009–12)===
On May 2, 2009, the band performed at Bamboozle Festival at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, the band&#x27;s third stint at the festival. During this time, Bayside finished their contract obligations with Victory Records, and released a cover of &quot;Beautiful Girls&quot; by Sean Kingston for the Fearless Records&#x27; cover compilation album &quot;Punk Goes Pop 2&quot;. The following summer the band finished its fourth stint on the Vans Warped Tour, and much of 2010 the band worked on its fifth album with plans on releasing it in early 2011, which the magazine Alternative Press named one of the most anticipated albums of 2010 in its annual feature.

On March 10, 2010, the Alternative Press website released news that Bayside has signed to the record label Wind-up Records, projecting the band&#x27;s next release to be fall of the same year. The band began tracking their fifth album and Wind Up Records debut on June 1, 2010, at Dreamland Studios in Woodstock, New York. Bayside enlisted the help of prolific British rock producer Gil Norton, who is best known for his work with the Foo Fighters, The Pixies, Counting Crows, Echo and the Bunnymen, Jimmy Eat World and Dashboard Confessional. In September 2010 the band announced through their Twitter account that the new album will be called &quot;Killing Time&quot;, and will be released on February 22, 2011. On October 5, 2010, the band announced the track listing for &quot;Killing Time&quot; on their Twitter. The first song, &quot;Already Gone&quot;, was put up for streaming exclusively on AbsolutePunk.net on October 18, 2010. Their first single from &quot;Killing Time&quot;, &quot;Sick, Sick, Sick&quot;, was released on November 16, 2010. On February 3, 2011, &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; was released on the Alternative Press website to be streamed for free, although it was played previously at an Acoustic set for 104.5 Radio with &quot;On Love, On Life&quot;.

Bayside played the 2011 Take Action Tour with Silverstein co-headlining, with opening acts including Polar Bear Club, The Swellers, and Texas In July. On April 26, 2011, the Take Action Vol. 10 compilation was released, which included a previously unreleased Bayside song, &quot;Battle Scars&quot;. Bayside announced that they would be going on tour with Saves The Day, I Am The Avalanche, and Transit from the middle of September 2011 to the middle of November 2011. During the tour, Rise Records released a 7&quot; vinyl compilation featuring one song from each of the bands touring, which was limited to only 2000 copies. The Bayside song featured on the 7&quot; split was the original demo of their new single &quot;Sick, Sick, Sick.&quot; After a break from touring, the band announced that they would be doing Warped Tour 2012 from June 16 to July 30, and Raneri would be playing solo acoustic sets on the Acoustic Basement Stage for the same tour dates.

===&quot;Covers Volume #1&quot; (EP) and &quot;Cult&quot; (2012–15)===
On September 17, 2012, Bayside announced they were self-releasing a cover EP entitled &quot;Covers Volume #1&quot;, through their own record label Gumshoe Records, which would be released on October 23, 2012. The EP contained covers of songs from Van Morrison, The Ronettes, Del Shannon, Elvis Costello and Billy Joel. They also announced that they would start writing a new album tentatively in January 2013. In an interview with Alternative Press on September 25, 2012, Raneri stated the intention of making more volumes of cover EPs as the reasoning behind naming this first one &quot;Covers Volume #1&quot;. Previously they had announced that they would be going on tour with Taking Back Sunday for their &quot;Tell All Your Friends&quot; 10 Year Anniversary Tour, which for Bayside started on October 4, 2012, and ended on November 23, 2012, in their hometown of New York City. On August 16, 2013, the band revealed that they have signed to Hopeless Records.

On November 12, 2013, Bayside revealed their sixth album, &quot;Cult&quot;, after a series of photos on their Instagram page symbolizing their previous albums. In the last picture, all symbols were depicted inside of a hexagram with six tally marks in the six point of the star. With the release, Bayside provided pre-orders that included a download of &quot;Pigsty&quot;, and a track list of the new album was also released on the band&#x27;s website. The album released on February 18, 2014, and the following April the band went on a UK tour with Alkaline Trio in support of the new album. They also featured on 2014 Warped Tour.

Bayside announced a 15-year anniversary tour beginning on March 5, 2015, with Senses Fail, Man Overboard, and Seaway. On June 25, 2015, the band announced a tour to be supported by The Early November and Better Off. The tour ran from August 31, 2015, through to September 18 with the tour concluding with a date at Riot Fest in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

===&quot;Vacancy&quot; and &quot;Acoustic Volume 2&quot; (2016–2018)===
On August 19, 2016, Bayside released their seventh studio album entitled &quot;Vacancy&quot; through Hopeless Records.

The band embarked on a US tour to support the album through August and September 2016 and have announced Australian tour dates for November 2016.

On August 16, 2018, the band announced they would be making another acoustic album, titled &quot;Acoustic Volume 2&quot;, updated with songs from newer albums. The album includes a new song, &quot;It Don&#x27;t Exist&quot;, and a music video was released for it on the day of the announcement. The album was released on September 28, 2018.

===&quot;Interrobang&quot;, &quot;The Red EP&quot; and &quot;The Blue EP&quot; (2019–present)===
On August 20, the band released a new single, titled &quot;Prayers&quot;.

On September 20, the band announced their eighth studio album, &quot;Interrobang&quot;, and released the title track along with a music video. The album&#x27;s release date was also set as October 4, only two weeks from this announcement.

A week later, a tour in support of the new album was announced along with a battle of the bands submission and voting based on the band&#x27;s website. The Contest was meant as a way for the band to support local unsigned bands and give them a chance to perform in front of a large crowd. Each concert would feature a local band as an opener.

In 2020, the band announced a 20th anniversary tour with Senses Fail, Hawthorne Heights, and Can&#x27;t Swim, but was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In May 2022, the band announced that they would be releasing an EP later in the year. With this announcement came the EP&#x27;s first single, &quot;Strangest Faces&quot;. On August 11, the second single, &quot;Good Advice&quot;, was released and on October 19 The Red EP was fully released via Hopeless Records.

The band then released &quot;The Blue EP&quot; on March 17, 2023, also via Hopeless Records.

==Other projects==
===Anthony Raneri solo project===
Frontman Anthony Raneri, through his personal blog, Twitter account and various interviews, hinted to a solo release. At midnight on December 4, 2009, Raneri released a demo version of the solo song &quot;The Ballad of Bill the Saint&quot; on his personal Myspace page, the first recorded song from a reported upcoming solo album. The song was recorded in one night at Chris Kirkpatrick&#x27;s studio in his own home, after the two met at one of Raneri&#x27;s solo shows in Orlando, Florida. On January 22, 2011, in an interview with Alternative Press, Raneri stated that he has no plans to release a solo album any time soon. However, as recently as August 20, 2011, Raneri stated at a solo show he was playing in Rhode Island, &quot;I was thinking about maybe putting out a solo record next year,&quot; and also mentioned that he had not revealed to his record label of his intentions about putting out a solo album yet, but joked that they would know of his intentions after he would post a video of the show on the internet. Raneri began recording his solo EP on December 13 in Los Angeles. Steve Choi from Rx Bandits, Davey Warsop from Beat Union, and Jarrod Alexander of My Chemical Romance were announced as his backing band and collaborators on the recording. On December 20, 2011, it was announced via Facebook that the solo EP was named &quot;New Cathedrals&quot; and was scheduled for an early 2012 release. On December 31, Raneri posted to his Facebook page that the EP would be released before the start of the &quot;Where&#x27;s the Band? Tour&quot; in January.

On January 10, 2012, the first song from the EP, &quot;Sandra Partial&quot;, was released for free streaming on Alternative Press. Also, via his Facebook page, Raneri released the artwork and track list of the EP. On January 16, another song from the EP, entitled &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Leave&quot;, was released on AbsolutePunk. That same day the full EP was released on iTunes, and within hours made it to number seven on the iTunes Store Top 10 Alternative Albums chart. On June 30, 2015, Raneri&#x27;s second EP was released on Hopeless Records. The title of the EP is &quot;Sorry State of Mind&quot; and its first single is titled &quot;Gone&quot;. The EP was recorded at his longtime friend Steve Soboslai&#x27;s, guitarist from the band Punchline, studio on Nashville&#x27;s Music Row.

Anthony announced a new solo EP, Everyday Royalty on August 22, 2024 to be released on November 15, 2024. The first single, Bones featuring Sam Tinnesz is an example of the Alt-Country vibe of the record. &quot;The seven tracks on the record seamlessly string together anthemic alt-rock, soul-searching indie-folk and full-tilt country.&quot;

===Chris Guglielmo solo project===
In 2024, drummer Chris Guglielmo launched his own solo project under the name Headtrip. His first EP &quot;No Love&quot; featured three new original songs, released on January 5, 2024. The EP was followed the next week by the single &quot;Black Tongues&quot;.

<text>St Erth () is a civil parish and village in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom.

St Erth takes its name from Saint Erc, one of the many Irish saints who brought Christianity to Cornwall during the Dark Ages, and is at the old crossing point of the River Hayle. The Cornish name of the place derives from St Uthinoch of whom little is known. The church of St Erth dates from the 15th-century, though an older church is said to have once stood on St Erth Hill overlooking the village.

The St Erth railway station is 0.75 miles from the village, at Rose-an-Grouse, and is on the Cornish Main Line from London Paddington to Penzance. It is also the junction for scenic St Ives Bay Line.

==Geography==
The village is four miles (6.5 km) southeast of St Ives and six miles (10 km) northeast of Penzance. The parish shares boundaries with Ludgvan in the west, Hayle in the north, and St Hilary in the south.

The old coaching road once led through the village, before the building of the causeway in 1825 along the edge of the Hayle Estuary. Prior to 1825 anyone wanting to go from Hayle to St Ives or Penzance had to cross the sands of the Hayle Estuary or make a significant detour crossing the River Hayle at the ancient St Erth Bridge. The Star Inn, in St Erth village centre, is a Grade II listed building coaching inn dating from the fourteenth/fifteenth centuries. It was along this route that tin was carried upcountry from the stannaries of Penwith. Guides took travellers across the sands, but, even with guides, it was sometimes a perilous journey and the shifting sand and racing tide claimed several lives. Because of this major obstacle to trade, a turnpike trust was formed, with Henry Harvey a trustee, to build the causeway which now takes the road below the plantation west to the Old Quay House. Costing £5000 in 1825, the investors charged a toll to use the causeway to recover their costs.

St Erth was the site of a large creamery operated by United Dairies: this was responsible for processing a large quantity of milk produced in Penwith.

===Manor houses===
Trewinnard Manor is an early 18th-century house built on a different site from its medieval predecessor by the Hawkins family. Trelissick Manor is a medieval house remodelled in 1688 for the Jacobite James Paynter, again remodelled in the 18th century and extended in the 19th century. Tredrea Manor is a 17th-century house but it was largely rebuilt c. 1856. The front is of five bays built in ashlar.

===St Erth Sand Pits===
St Erth Sand Pits were worked for Pliocene sands and clays. The clay was used for fixing candles to miners&#x27; helmets and also for puddling the dry dock at Penzance. Later it was used by Bernard Leach at his pottery in St Ives. The clay was the source of significant fossil finds and in 1886 the Royal Society obtained a government grant to search the shell-beds. In 1962 the pits were designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). However, the main use of the sand in this location was for the metal foundries throughout Cornwall, but especially for Harvey&#x27;s of nearby Hayle, and beyond. The sand grains are found coated with a thin film of clay. With gentle pressure and the correct percentage of water the sand grains will bind together and can be used for making a sand mould into which molten metals can be poured to make engineering castings. One of the disused pits is a geological nature reserve owned by Cornwall Wildlife Trust and part of St. Erth Sand Pits SSSI is owned by the Diocese of Truro (via their Diocesan Board of Finance). Another good source of clay for fixing candles to miners&#x27; helmets was on St Agnes Beacon.

==Parish church==

The parish church is dedicated to St Erc (Latin &quot;Ercus&quot;) and is probably of the 14th-century. It is not a large church and has a west tower of three stages. There are north and south aisles, the arcade in the north aisle having piers of two different types. The church was restored in 1874, at which time two dormer windows were inserted in the roof. The wagon roof of the south porch is old and the font is Norman and of an unusual square design. The ornate wooden roofs of the nave and aisles and fine oak screen decorated with the Four Evangelists are due to the restoration of 1874.

The church is sited in a wooded area and the churchyard, according to Charles Henderson, &quot;greatly enhances the building&quot;. The names of eight places in the parish are recorded as having chapels or shrines in the medieval registers, including Bosworgey (St Mary Magdalene) and Gurlyn.

There are six Cornish crosses in the parish: two are in the churchyard and the others are in the churchtown and at Battery Mill, Tregenhorne and Trevean.

==Cornish wrestling==
There have been Cornish wrestling tournaments, for prizes, have been held in St Erth at least throughout the last century. Tournaments have been held at the field at Treloweth, near St Erth station and at Tredrea Manor.

==Local government==
For the purposes of local government St Erth forms a civil parish and elects eleven parish councillors every four years to St Erth Parish Council. The local authority is Cornwall Council.

==Twinning==
St Erth has been twinned with Ploulec&#x27;h in Brittany, France since 1998.

<doc id="677909" wikidata="Q834815" url="?curid=677909" title="New Life Movement">
<text>The New Life Movement () was a government-led civic campaign in the 1930s Republic of China to promote cultural reform and Neo-Confucian social morality and to ultimately unite China under a centralised ideology following the emergence of ideological challenges to the status quo. Chiang Kai-shek as head of the government and the Chinese Nationalist Party launched the initiative on 19 February 1934 as part of an anti-Communist campaign, and soon enlarged the campaign to target the whole nation.

Chiang and his wife, Soong Mei-ling, who played a major role in the campaign, advocated a life guided by four virtues, &quot;lǐ&quot; (禮/礼, proper rite), &quot;yì&quot; (義/义, righteousness or justice), &quot;lián&quot; (廉, honesty and cleanness) and &quot;chǐ&quot; (恥/耻, shame; sense of right and wrong). The campaign proceeded with help of the Blue Shirts Society and the CC Clique within the Nationalist Party, and Christian missionaries in China.

== Historical context ==
The New Life Movement was founded at a time when China, already weakened by Western imperialism, faced the threats of rising Japanese militarism, domestic factionalism and communism. The launch of the New Life Movement was set in the context of the Chiangs&#x27; growing concern with corruption, and moral decadence that they blamed on foreign influences. Historian Colin Mackerras writes that &quot;Corruption was an abiding feature of Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s rule&quot; and that nepotism and bribery were rife among the bureaucracy. Chiang charged that &quot;If we do not weed the present body of corruption, bribery, perfunctoriness, and ignorance, and establish instead a clean, effective administration, the day will soon come when the revolution will be started against us as we did the Manchus&quot;.

Chiang claimed that Chinese were &quot;unbearably filthy&quot;, &quot;hedonistic&quot;, &quot;lazy&quot;, and physically and spiritually &quot;decrepit&quot;, and thus leading lives that were &quot;barbaric and devoid of reason.&quot; Chiang&#x27;s political rival, Wang Jingwei described Chinese life as a life of &quot;smoking,&quot; &quot;sickness,&quot; &quot;gambling,&quot; &quot;filth,&quot; &quot;ghosts&quot; (i.e., superstition), and &quot;indolence&quot;. Wang argued the fundamental psychological basis of such behaviour was &quot;lackadaisicalness&quot; (隨便主義, &quot;suibian zhuyi&quot;) and &quot;self seekingness&quot; (自理主義, &quot;zili zhuyi&quot;). He contended that &quot;lackadaisicalness&quot; led to lives without a sense of right or wrong, and hence with no distinctions or purpose. &quot;Self-seekingness,&quot; he argued, led to the rejection of all outside interference with this kind of behaviour as encroachment on &quot;freedom&quot;. There was no consideration for others and their rights, only of one&#x27;s own comfort, inevitably obstructing social life and group solidarity.

In Chiang&#x27;s mind, these concerns were compounded by the influx of foreign ideas following the New Culture Movement and May Fourth Movement which fostered Western concepts such as liberalism, pragmatism and nationalism as well as more radical ideas including Marxism respectively. The Movement attempted to counter such threats through a resurrection of traditional Chinese morality, which it held to more suitable to Chinese society to modern Western values. As such the Movement was based upon Confucianism, mixed with Christianity, nationalism and authoritarianism which have some similarities to fascism, which some saw as rejecting individualism and liberalism, while also opposing radical movements such as socialism and communism.

Soong Mei-ling called for a program of spiritual enlightenment. She wrote in &quot;Forum&quot;, an American magazine, in 1935, that &quot;the mere accumulation of great wealth is not sufficient to enable China to resume her position as a great nation.&quot; There must be, she continued, &quot;also revival of the spirit, since spiritual values transcend mere material riches. She played a major role both in launching the Movement and in representing its public face.

Soong Meiling insisted that while some puritanical Chinese politicians tried to co-opt the New Life Movement for their own ends, her husband made efforts to put an end to their activities. In her interview with Fulton Oursler, a famous American journalist who interviewed her in Shanghai regarding the Movement in August 1937, she stated that: &quot;No. China would never take Fascism or any form of the totalitarian state. We can&#x27;t ever be really regimented. Every Chinese is a personality. He will always think for himself. He has an ancient and magnificent culture, a sense of justice, a love of freedom. The New Life Movement has definitely rejected all forms of regimentation as being opposed to the principles of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and so betraying the people.&quot;

The New Life targeted the official, educated, and affluent classes in the belief that China&#x27;s ills could be cured &quot;by example
and exhortation from above.&quot; This trickle-down philosophy of societal transformation neatly paralleled a Confucian belief: &quot;The virtue of the
gentleman is like wind; the virtue of the commoner is like grass. Let the wind blow over the grass and it is sure to bend.&quot; This concept of &quot;salvation from within&quot; was also purportedly on some level modeled on the Christian notion of changing the world by changing individuals.

Although Meiling acknowledged that the Blue Shirts were &quot;stupid, overzealous, dizzy with success&quot;, she also stated that the government did not officially support most of their activities or condone their behavior. Several prominent figures within the KMT itself, however, also openly criticized the New Life Movement. Soong Chingling, Meiling&#x27;s elder sister who long espoused socialist ideals in contrast with Meiling&#x27;s more traditional Christian ones, dismissed the New Life Movement as a &quot;pedantic&quot; exercise that &quot;gives nothing to the people&quot; and that such profound emphasis on ancient Confucian ideals of proper behavior were largely impractical and ill-advised in a time when millions of Chinese families were still starving daily. She further argued that, &quot;The aim of revolution is the material welfare of human beings...if that is not reached then there has been no revolution.&quot; Their essential differences, with Chingling focusing mostly on the Chinese people&#x27;s considerable material necessities, and Meiling on what she saw as their people&#x27;s lofty spiritual needs, contributed to the rift between the two once-close sisters, which eventually led to Chingling leaving the KMT entirely and joining the Communists.

The leading prominent liberal voice in the KMT, Hu Shih, stated that as &quot;there is neither any panacea to save the country nor will there be any miracle cure to revive the nation&quot;, the problems that the Movement sought to address were indeed considerable and prevalent, but Chiang&#x27;s methods of countering them were much less valid, and that the ROC should focus on renewing the material well-being of the Chinese people before trying to revive their so-called spirituality. According to Hu Shih, &quot;When children were scouring rubbish dumps to find half a burnt-out coal, or a bit of filthy rag, how could you accuse them of dishonesty if they pocketed a lost item they had picked up? The first responsibility of the government is to make sure the average man can live a decent life…To teach them how to lead this so-called new life can only be the last thing.&quot;

James Gareth Endicott, who served as Meiling&#x27;s New Life Movement adviser and had a close relationship with her, protested to Meiling about what he saw as the KMT&#x27;s drift towards non-liberal ideologies, feeling that she was perhaps among the more reasonable members of the Nationalist government. Although Endicott supported some aspects of the Movement, he disagreed that it should be involved in the government. After she urged him to share his growing concerns with Chiang personally, Endicott brusquely told Chiang that if he failed to base the government&#x27;s domestic policies on the needs of the people, including instituting agrarian reform, then revolutionary forces would eventually rise against him. Chiang replied that while he had plans for land reform, he could not carry them out &quot;while there are so many Communists around to take advantage of it&quot;, ending their discussion after a heated exchange.

Chiang&#x27;s original inception of the New Life Movement purportedly stemmed from his personal negative experiences in both the Soviet Union and in Communist parts of China, where he became repulsed by their harsh reality of class struggle. &quot;The poor were told it was right to rob the rich; employees were encouraged to betray or even kill their employers; children were urged to denounce their parents. To Chiang, these &#x27;struck at all the fundamental principles&#x27; of traditional Chinese ethics. He took it upon himself to resurrect the ethics of old China, in which loyalty and honour were essential.&quot;

Chiang Kai-shek used the Confucian and Methodist notion of self-cultivation and correct living for the Movement; to this end it prescribed proper etiquette on every aspect of daily life. He considered the New Life Movement a key part of the program to carry out the &quot;principle of the people&#x27;s livelihood&quot; in Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s Three Principles of the People.

== Doctrines and principal beliefs ==
Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s September 1934 speech stated that the New Life Movement aimed at the &quot;promotion of a regular life guided by the four virtues,&quot; – &#x27;Lǐ&#x27; (proper rite), &quot;Yì&#x27; (righteousness or justice), &quot;lián &quot;(honesty and cleanness) &quot;and chǐ&quot; (shame; sense of right and wrong)&quot;. These virtues, he went on,
:must be applied to ordinary life in the matter of food, clothing, shelter, and action. The four virtues are the essential principles for the promotion of morality. They form the major rules for dealing with men and human affairs, for cultivating oneself and for adjustment to one&#x27;s surroundings. Whoever violates these rules is bound to fail, and a nation that neglects them will not survive.&quot; 

Chiang later extended the four virtues to eight by the addition of &quot;Promptness&quot;, &quot;Precision,&quot; &quot;Harmoniousness,&quot; and &quot;Dignity&quot;. These elements were summarized in two basic forms: &quot;cleanliness&quot; and &quot;discipline&quot; and were viewed as the first step in achieving a &quot;new life&quot;. People were encouraged to engage in modern polite behaviour, such as not to spit, urinate or sneeze in public. They were encouraged to adopt good table manners such as not making noises when eating. Nearly 100 such rules governed everyday life.
== Influences on the Movement ==
The ideological strictness of the New Life Movement had many similarities with Neo-Confucianism, which had been the dominant moral philosophy of previous centuries. The New life Movement &quot;four virtues&quot; were taken from Confucian school of thought. Paul Linebarger had stated that the New Life Movement&#x27;s &quot;principles consist of a simple restatement of the cardinal Confucian personal virtues, interpreted to suit modern conditions.&quot;

The historian Lloyd Eastman saw Chiang&#x27;s goal as unifying China under a singular ideology, a fascist one at that, with the resulting New Life Movement being a popularized or a &quot;sloganized Confucianism&quot;. According to Keith Schoppa, the new set of beliefs was seen to be easy to execute, with four main virtues backed by 95 further sub-rules that regulated the everyday life of the regular Chinese citizen.

The Movement was also shaped by Chiang&#x27;s Christianity. According to Elmer Clark, the new doctrine was &quot;an ambitious moral and ethical enterprise which proposed nothing less than a Chinese renaissance, a complete reformation of the habits, customs and manners of one fourth of the human race, to bring them more in line with the accepted morals of Christian civilisation&quot;. Overlapping moral guidelines exist between Confucianism and Christianity. The 95 rules placed in the New Life movement often blur the lines between the influence of the two on the Movement, such as &quot;do not gamble&quot; or &quot;be polite and courteous to women and children&quot;.

This Movement has also been accused of having a totalitarian element. Dirlik sees the movement as a &quot;modern counterrevolution&quot; opposed to an &quot;anti-revolutionary conservatism&quot; due to the fact that it instrumentalised traditional moral codes and societal constructs. Some historians regard this movement as imitating Nazism and regarded this movement as being a neo-nationalistic movement used to elevate Chiang&#x27;s control of everyday lives. Frederic Wakeman suggested that the New Life Movement was &quot;Confucian fascism&quot;. Other historians, however, have provided more positive or mixed reviews of the New Life Movement, noting that it was not without some positive benefits to Chinese society at the time, and have argued that while a flawed, overidealistic and puritanical movement, it was not necessarily a fascist one at its core.

== Reception ==
Despite the grandiose goal of revitalising and revolutionising China, the New Life Movement ultimately ended in failure as both domestic and foreign reception remained paltry throughout the duration of the movement. The combination of the movement&#x27;s inability to formulate a systematic ideology and the seeming banality of its concerns caused both Chinese and foreign commentators to ignore the significance of New Life ideology and intentions and instead to stress the more superficial aspects of the movement. Consequently, the movement was approached variously as a joke, or to those taking it more seriously, a shallow and antiquated regression to Chinese tradition when tradition had already proved incapable of solving China&#x27;s problems. Historian Suzy Kim summarizes its failure as due to a &quot;lack of cohesion.&quot; 

The Movement&#x27;s inability to formulate a systematic ideology and abstract code of ethics contrasted sharply with the promises of the Communists, who spoke sharply and to the point on taxation, distribution of land and the disposition of overlords. From the perspective of some impoverished Chinese citizens, the policies of Marxists were far more practical and coherent, leading to the lack of significance attributed to the New Life Movement. On a Western perspective, Chiang&#x27;s complex code of ethics was far too abstract and lacking in action to be useful or pragmatic, perceived as being superficial and inordinately idealistic.  

The lack of popular domestic reception is exacerbated by the behaviour of the Blue Shirts, a far-right fascist group that enforced the rules of the New Life Movement. Historian Sterling Seagrave writes &quot;by 1936, the Blue Shirts were running amok, driven by excesses of zeal and brutality, giving the New Life Movement a bad name&quot;. The Literary Digest observed that year, &#x27;Most likely to upset the teacups were Chiang&#x27;s own civilian, anti-foreign, bombing, stabbing, shooting &#x27;Blue Shirt&#x27; terrorists, who once useful, now unmanageable, have become something of a Frankenstein monster.&quot; The association of the violent and repressive behaviour of the Blue Shirts compounded the less than enthusiastic reception of the Movement, further attributing to it a negative reputation as well.

Other historians assert that the New Life Movement was not without its merits and positive values either, although they also concede it was not able to offset the KMT&#x27;s painstaking struggle to resolve China&#x27;s deep-rooted and complex socioeconomic problems.

According to Jonathan Fenby, &quot;Many New Life rules were eminently sensible, such as those advocating healthy living, cleanliness, vaccination, and the killing of flies and mosquitoes. Compared to attempts to re-educate and dragoon the Chinese people by Chiang&#x27;s Communist successor, the movement was positively benign. But, in a country with problems on the scale of those faced by China, the initiative was like the admonitions of a frustrated father wagging his finger at his unruly children. The message never reached the bulk of illiterate peasants, who were, in any case, more concerned with survival than with wearing their hats straight. Being told to eat in silence and go to bed early could only make the modern-minded urban elite regard the regime as a bunch of petty busybodies.&quot; Fenby also notes that modern-day China itself has also tried similar government-sponsored efforts to encourage the Chinese people to &quot;behave better&quot;, citing the Public Morality Day of autumn 2003 as &quot;a loud echo of the New Life movement.&quot;

Rana Mitter commented that, &quot;Despite its anti-communism, it shared many values and assumptions with the CCP, with its stress on frugality and collective values. Yet it never had much success. While China suffered from a massive agricultural and fiscal crisis, prescriptions about clothes and orderly behaviour did not have much popular traction.&quot; He also asserted that contemporary China has consciously or not imitated many aspects of the New Life Movement in recent years, pointing to Chinese society, where points are given by local committees to residents who throw away their
garbage and put out plants to decorate their houses. In the run-up to the Olympics, Beijing residents were told of a new &#x27;morality evaluation index&#x27; which would give credit for &#x27;displays of patriotism, large book collections, and balconies full of potted plants&#x27; and lower grades for &#x27;alcohol abuse, noise complaints, pollution, or a violation of licences covering internet cafes and karaoke parlours&#x27;. Public toilets in tourist areas are also being upgraded and star-rated.&quot;

Jay Taylor argues that Chiang&#x27;s motives for launching the New Life Movement were overall understandable given China&#x27;s dire situation at the time, even if it did not achieve the results that many had hoped or imagined, nor did Chiang really seek to use the Movement itself to engage in imperialism, but to address legitimately overwhelming issues in Chinese society: &quot;The values that the movement sought to inculcate were mostly simple neo-Confucian merits and traditional Japanese habits—frugality and conscience, simplicity, honesty, and even promptness, hygiene, and neatness. For critics,
the disturbing aspect of the movement was its intention to &quot;thoroughly militarize the lives of the citizens of the entire nation.&quot; Yet the purpose of this
&quot;complete militarization&quot; was not to conquer other people but to cultivate &quot;courage and swiftness, the endurance of suffering, a tolerance of hard work,
especially the habit and ability of unified action.&quot; The aim was to say &quot;farewell to yesterday&#x27;s barbarian way of life, its disorderliness, lethargy, and depression.&quot; These were hardly objectionable goals, especially when framed in the innocent bromides of Confucius and Christ.&quot; He also notes that Chiang developed deep personal reservations regarding the Blue Shirts, having mused in a letter to the newspaper &quot;&#x27;Dagongbao&quot;, &quot;How would I differ from the Communists...if I were to imitate the so-called fascists...of Italy?&quot; and by mid-1934, had become &quot;thoroughly disillusioned with the organization&quot;. Unlike the Brown Shirts, who numbered two million and functioned as Hitler&#x27;s private paramilitary around the same time period, the exclusive Blue Shirts had only about three hundred official members when it finally disbanded in 1938.

Federica Ferlanti notes that for all its shortcomings, the New Life Movement was nevertheless able to help rally considerable number of ordinary Chinese people to the anti-Japanese war effort, particularly urbanite Chinese women, who in one instance helped raise an &quot;extraordinary amount of money during the New Life Movement Fifth Anniversary fund-raising campaign of 1939.&quot; She further states that &quot;the involvement of civil servants through the New Life Movement wartime campaigns prevented the disintegration of society and administrative institutions under the impact of the war in the first phase of the conflict&quot; and that in conclusion, &quot;the complex network of New Life Movement organisations in the administrative structure helped stabilise the Nationalist state during the first years of the war, and the involvement of civil servants tempered the centrifugal drifting of the administrative institutions.&quot;

== Implementations ==
The New Life Movement aimed to control Chinese lifestyles. Some measures and moral codes included: opposition to littering and spitting at random; opposition to opium use; opposition to conspicuous consumption; rejection of immoral entertainment in favour of artistic and athletic pursuits; courteous behaviour; saluting the flag. Chiang urged citizens to bathe with cold water, since the (supposed) Japanese habit of washing their faces with cold water was a sign of their military strength.

Chiang relied on government law enforcement to reinforce moral behaviour. Task forces were created in different regions to implement the movement, yet, in reports from some districts on the implementation, the movement was seen to be severely underfunded, understaffed and poorly understood by law enforcement officials.

The Blue Shirts were also instrumental in the implementation of the New Life movement. The neo-right wing group at first sought to correct the behaviour of those not following the four virtues and the further 95 rules placed. However, they soon turned to force to reinforce Chiang&#x27;s ideals, giving bad publicity and views on the movement. The excessive violence used by the Blue Shirts encompassed the movement, leading to a reluctant public in following the new dogma in place by the KMT.

==Historical evaluations==
In the words of Soong Mei-ling&#x27;s biographer, the New Life Movement was a &quot;curious East-West ideological fusion of neo-Confucian precepts, thinly disguised, New Testament Christianity, YMCA-Style social activism, elements of Bushido—the samurai code—and European fascism, along with a generous dose of New England Puritanism.&quot; She concluded that, &quot;In reality, the real and lasting impact of the New Life Movement on Chinese society was limited. Albeit noble, its battle against the immemorial ills of Chinese life—gambling, opium, debauchery, poverty, begging, robbery, filth, corruption, and indifference to the public good amounted to tilting at windmills. A mass movement that rejected popular initiative, New Life tried to imbue the public with a political consciousness while denying it a political voice.&quot; Arif Dirlik explains the Movement as motivated by the need to counter Communist success in both ideological appeal and political organization. 

Historian Suzy Kim contrasts the New Life Movement with the later Cultural Revolution. While both movements had superficial similarities in terms of changing everyday behavior, &quot;The New Life Movement sought to expand the power of the state and was instituted from the top down for the purposes of mobilizing people around its own agenda as a form of &#x27;controlled popular mobilization,&#x27; whereas the Cultural Revolution was a bottom-up movement that periodically escaped control of the state[.]&quot;

According to American professor and political scientist A. James Gregor, who disputes other historians&#x27; critical assessment of the Movement, &quot;In effect, there was nothing in the New Life Movement that was specifically fascist. Certainly the Chinese Marxists did not so characterize it when it first manifested itself in early 1934. In fact, for a very long time Chinese Marxists did not identify &#x27;fascism&#x27; in the political activities of the Kuomintang, even though as early as 1928 they conceived its suppression of Communist activities in China as part of a program of &quot;White Terror.&quot; &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot; briefly mentions the New Life Movement, describing it as neither a specifically reactionary nor a particularly successful sociopolitical movement, simply as &quot;a program that sought to halt the spread of communism by teaching traditional Chinese values&quot;.

According to Hans van de Ven, &quot;Although it is easy to lampoon the New Life Movement – as indeed it was at the time – it has had a long influence. Even today many schools and offices in China display &#x27;civility certificates&#x27; in the same way that those in the West display hygiene and health and safety certifications. Today, CCP general secretary Xi Jinping&#x27;s administration has again imposed limits on entertainment allowances and continues to campaign against extravagance. New Life ideals have sufficiently broad appeal that their promotion bolsters the standing of those in power. He also points to the Hunan peasant revolution in 1927, in which former CCP leader Mao Zedong noted that &quot;they [the peasantry] were eradicating the old China&#x27;s vices of gambling, opium-smoking, vulgar opera performances, superstition, excessive feasting and banditry&quot;, through which Mao defended the use of extreme force to end what he saw as corrupt and harmful practices. Mao himself eventually implemented the &#x27;Three Rules of Discipline&#x27; (obedience to orders, no confiscations of peasant property and the prompt surrender to higher authority of all things taken from landlords) and &#x27;Eight Points of Attention&#x27; (politeness, honesty, courtesy to women and so on) in an effort to make Chinese soldiers aspire to higher standards of behavior.

<text>200 Cigarettes is a 1999 American comedy film directed by Risa Bramon Garcia and written by Shana Larsen. The film follows multiple characters in New York City on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1981. The film features an ensemble cast consisting of brothers Ben and Casey Affleck, Dave Chappelle, Guillermo Díaz, Angela Featherstone, Janeane Garofalo, Gaby Hoffmann, Kate Hudson, Courtney Love, Jay Mohr, Nicole Ari Parker, Martha Plimpton, Christina Ricci and Paul Rudd, with a cameo by Elvis Costello, as well as paintings by Sally Davies.

==Plot==
The film follows various plot arcs all occurring on New Year&#x27;s Eve of 1981. Monica is throwing a big party and is desperately afraid no one will attend. Early on, the only arrival is her friend Hillary. As Monica tries to convince Hillary to stay, various other groupings are shown making their way to the celebration.

The plot follows these several characters as they spend New Year&#x27;s Eve in New York City before eventually turning up at Monica&#x27;s party. The party guests are:
* Monica&#x27;s cousin Val and her friend Stephie, who are from Ronkonkoma and who get lost in the seedy Alphabet City section of the borough and wander into a punk club where they meet Dave and Tom, who have a &quot;package&quot; they need to deliver.
* Ditsy and awkward Cindy, who is on a dinner date with the paranoid Jack.
* Lucy and her best friend Kevin, who are struggling with their mutual sexual tension. The film&#x27;s title stems from the carton of cigarettes Lucy buys Kevin that night, a present on a holiday he loathes, which is also his birthday.
* Kevin&#x27;s feminist ex-girlfriend Ellie, who walks in on Kevin and Lucy making out in a restroom stall
* A dim-witted and flirtatious bartender.
* Competitive friends Bridget and Caitlyn who attempt to ditch Bridget&#x27;s boyfriend Eric, who is also Monica&#x27;s ex.
* And an eccentric cab driver who takes them all around town throughout the evening in his disco-themed taxi.

Eventually, everyone finds their way to the party, although Monica has passed out after drowning her sorrows in alcohol. She wakes the next morning to find unrecognizable people on her floor, including Stephie, who tells her what a big hit her party was. Monica is thrilled, even though she missed it all, especially when she finds out that Elvis Costello showed up.

The final montage shows Polaroids of the party, narrated by the disco cabbie, mostly featuring the unlikely romances from the night and the unconscious Monica being propped up by her guests.

==Cast==
==Release==
The film received generally negative reviews and grossed $6.8 million in the United States.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a &quot;rotten&quot; approval rating of 30% based on 63 reviews, with an average rating of 4.4/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;[a] clumsy and scattered comedy with a poorly executed script&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 33 out of 100 based on reviews from 26 critics, indicating &quot;Generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;dismally unfunny&quot; and questions &quot;if any director could have surmounted the script&#x27;s limitations&quot; and of the acting performances he says &quot;only Garofalo and Ben Affleck manage to project any wit that cracks through the prevailing humorlessness.&quot;

Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; gave it a positive review, saying &quot;&quot;200 Cigarettes&quot; doesn&#x27;t have a bad scene or a false note. The picture is a succession of pointed little moments, nicely written by Shana Larsen and acted with comic assurance and sensitivity.&quot;

<doc id="677922" wikidata="Q765177" url="?curid=677922" title="The Standells">
<text>The Standells are an American garage rock band from Los Angeles, California, formed in the 1960s, who have been referred to as a &quot;punk band of the 1960s&quot;, and said to have inspired such groups as the Sex Pistols and Ramones. They recorded the 1966 hit &quot;Dirty Water&quot;, written by their producer, Ed Cobb. (Ed Cobb also wrote &quot;Tainted Love&quot;, a Gloria Jones song which became world famous when Soft Cell did a version of it.) &quot;Dirty Water&quot; is the anthem of several Boston sports teams and is played following every Boston Red Sox and Boston Bruins home win.

==History==
The Standells band was formed in 1962 by lead vocalist and keyboard player Larry Tamblyn (born Lawrence Arnold Tamblyn, February 5, 1943), guitarist Tony Valentino (born Emilio Bellissimo, May 24, 1941), bass guitarist Jody Rich, and drummer Benny King (aka Hernandez). Tamblyn had previously been a solo performer, recording several 45 singles in the late 1950s and early 1960s including &quot;Dearest&quot;, &quot;Patty Ann&quot;, &quot;This Is The Night&quot;, &quot;My Bride To Be&quot; and &quot;Destiny&quot; for Faro and Linda Records. He is the brother of actor Russ Tamblyn and the uncle of actor Amber Tamblyn.

The Standells band name was created by Larry Tamblyn, derived from &quot;stand&quot;ing around booking agents&#x27; offices trying to get work. In early 1962, drummer Benny King joined the group, and as &quot;the Standels&quot;, their first major performance was in Honolulu at the Oasis Club. After several months, Rich and King departed. Tamblyn then assumed leadership of the group. He and Valentino re-formed the Standels, adding bass guitarist Gary Lane (September 18, 1938 – November 5, 2014) and drummer Gary Leeds, later known as Gary Walker of The Walker Brothers. Later that year, the band lengthened its name to &quot;Larry Tamblyn &amp; the Standels&quot;. In 1963 an extra &quot;L&quot; was added, and as &quot;Larry Tamblyn and the Standells&quot; the group made its first recording &quot;You&#x27;ll Be Mine Someday/Girl In My Heart&quot; for Linda Records (released in 1964). In the latter part of the year, the band permanently shortened its name to &quot;The Standells&quot;. After the Standells signed with Liberty in 1964, Leeds left the group, and was replaced by lead vocalist and drummer Dick Dodd. Dodd was a former Mouseketeer who had been the original drummer for The Bel-Airs, known for the surf rock song &quot;Mr. Moto&quot;, and eventually became the singer who sang lead on all of the Standells hit songs.

In 1964, Liberty Records released three Standells singles and an album, &quot;The Standells in Person at P.J.s&quot;. The album was later re-issued as &quot;The Standells Live and Out of Sight&quot;. The band also appeared on &quot;The Munsters&quot; TV show, as themselves in the episode &quot;Far Out Munsters,&quot; performing &quot;Come On and Ringo&quot; and a version of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;. In late 1964, they signed with Vee Jay and released two singles in 1965. Later in the year they signed with MGM for one single.

The group appeared in several low-budget films of the 1960s, including &quot;Get Yourself a College Girl&quot; (1964) and cult classic &quot;Riot on Sunset Strip&quot; (1967). The Standells performed incidental music in the 1963 Connie Francis movie &quot;Follow the Boys&quot;, which coincidentally co-starred Larry Tamblyn&#x27;s brother, Russ Tamblyn. The Standells played the part of the fictional rock group the &quot;Love Bugs&quot; on the television sitcom &quot;Bing Crosby Show&quot; in the January 18, 1965, episode &quot;Bugged by the Love Bugs&quot;. In addition to appearing in the aforementioned &quot;The Munsters&quot; episode as themselves, they also appeared performing an instrumental in the background in the March 29, 1965 &quot;Ben Casey&quot; series episode, &quot;Three &#x27;Lil Lambs.&quot; The band also performed the title song for the 1965 children&#x27;s movie, &quot;Zebra in the Kitchen&quot;.

Some reports state that early versions of the band had a relatively clean image and performed only cover songs. However, early 1964 photos counter that notion, showing the Standells with long hair, making them one of the first American rock groups to adopt that style. In order to work in conservative nightclubs like P.J.&#x27;s, the group members were forced to cut their shaggy locks. Like the Beatles, early rock groups did mostly cover songs in nightclubs.

In 1965 the group – Dodd, Tamblyn, Valentino and Lane – signed with Capitol Records&#x27; label Tower, teaming up with producer Ed Cobb. Cobb wrote the group&#x27;s most popular song, &quot;Dirty Water&quot;, which the band recorded in late 1965. The song&#x27;s references to the city of Boston are owed to Cobb&#x27;s experiences with a mugger in Boston. The song also makes reference to the Boston Strangler and the dorm curfews for college women in those days.

&quot;Dirty Water&quot; reached No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts on July 09, 1966, No. 8 on the &quot;Cashbox&quot; charts on July 9, 1966, and No. 1 on the Record World charts. &quot;Dirty Water&quot; was on the WLS playlist for 17 total weeks, tied only by &quot;California Dreamin&#x27;&quot; for most weeks on that playlist during the 1960s. Though the song is credited solely to Cobb, band members Dodd, Valentino and Tamblyn have claimed substantial material-of-fact song composition copyright contributions to it as well as contributing to its arrangement. Tamblyn has stated that Cobb&#x27;s version was a &quot;standard blues song&quot;, adding: &quot;We took the song with the condition that we could arrange in any way we want; we added the guitar riff into it and all of the wonderful vocal asides like, &#x27;I&#x27;m gonna tell you a story, It&#x27;s all about my town, I&#x27;m going to tell you a big fat story&#x27;...that was all written by us.&quot;

According to critic Richie Unterberger,&quot;Dirty Water&quot; [was] an archetypal garage rock hit with its Stones-ish riff, lecherous vocal, and combination of raunchy guitar and organ. While they never again reached the Top 40, they cut a number of strong, similar tunes in the 1966–1967 era that have belatedly been recognized as 1960s punk classics. &quot;Garage rock&quot; may not have been a really accurate term for them in the first place, as the production on their best material was full and polished, with some imaginative touches of period psychedelia and pop. &quot;Dirty Water&quot; is listed in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s &quot;500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.&quot;

Dodd briefly left the Standells in early 1966, and was replaced by Dewey Martin, who became a member of Buffalo Springfield. Dodd returned to the group a few months later, as the &quot;Dirty Water&quot; song began to climb the charts. The band recorded additional songs for their first full studio album &quot;Dirty Water&quot; in April 1966. Another popular track on the album was &quot;Sometimes Good Guys Don&#x27;t Wear White&quot;, which would later be recorded by Washington, D.C. hardcore band Minor Threat, New York City punk band The Cramps, and Swedish garage band The Nomads.

The follow-up studio album, &quot;Why Pick on Me — Sometimes Good Guys Don&#x27;t Wear White&quot;, was released in November 1966 and included the single &quot;Why Pick on Me&quot;, which peaked at No. 54 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. Gary Lane left the Standells in 1966, and was replaced by bass guitarist Dave Burke. John Fleck (born John William Fleckenstein in Los Angeles, August 2, 1946 – October 18, 2017), formerly of Love, soon replaced Burke in early 1967. The band then released their third album, &quot;The Hot Ones!&quot; In early 1967. It was simply a selection of popular songs that they covered. The band&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Try It&quot;, released in October 1967, contained the song &quot;Riot on Sunset Strip&quot;, which had been released earlier in 1967 to support the soundtrack for the movie of the same name. The title track &quot;Try It&quot; was later recorded by Ohio Express and Cobra Killer. Picked by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine to be the Standells&#x27; next hit, &quot;Try It&quot; was banned by Texas radio mogul Gordon McLendon, who deemed the record to have sexually suggestive lyrics. The Standells were asked by Art Linkletter to debate with McLendon on his &quot;House Party&quot; TV show in 1967. By most accounts, McLendon was handily defeated, but, by then, most radio stations had followed McLendon&#x27;s lead and would not play the record. A third single released from this album, &quot;Can&#x27;t Help But Love You&quot;, would be the Standells last entry into the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, reaching No. 78, while also peaking at No. 9 in the &quot;Cashbox&quot; charts.

In 1968, Dick Dodd left the band to pursue a solo career. The Standells continued to perform with a varying line-up thereafter, briefly including guitarist Lowell George who went on to play with Little Feat.

==Later reformations and versions of the band==

In the 1980s, Dodd, Tamblyn and Valentino performed at a few shows with The Fleshtones. In 1984 the Standells played at the Club Lingerie on Sunset in Los Angeles and did some casino shows in Reno, Nevada.
In the late 1980s, the Standells, with Tamblyn and Valentino, recorded and released an independent single featuring Tamblyn singing &quot;60&#x27;s Band&quot; In 1999, the Standells, featuring Dodd, Valentino and Tamblyn, along with bass player Peter Stuart, appeared at the Cavestomp festival in New York, and their performance was subsequently released as an album called &quot;Ban THIS!&quot;. As the title suggests, the Standells were thumbing their noses at McLendon. In 2000, bassist Gary Lane re-joined the Standells to perform at Las Vegas Grind. Between 2004 and 2007 the band was called upon to reform to make several appearances at major Boston sporting events. In 2006 the band sued Anheuser Busch for over $1 million after the company used &quot;Dirty Water&quot; in sports-related beer commercials without permission.

After a show at the Cannery Casino and Hotel in Las Vegas in May 2009, The Standells reformed with Tamblyn and former bassist John Fleck, along with guitarist Paul Downing and veteran drummer Greg Burnham. The group went on to make appearances at Los Angeles venues Amoeba Records, Echoplex and the Whisky a Go Go. In 2010 they toured in Europe, performing in several countries, including their first ever UK show at 229 The Venue in London on June 19, 2010. In late 2010, Downing was replaced by guitarist Adam Marsland. In 2011, the band decided to record their first new album in over 40 years. Through Kickstarter, the Standells raised money towards the cost of the album. Marsland left the group shortly thereafter. He was replaced by singer/guitarist Mark Adrian, a former member of the rock group . In March 2012, the Standells performed at the SXSW Festival.

In September 2012, Dick Dodd briefly rejoined the group, and they appeared at the Monterey Summer of Love &quot;45 Years On&quot; Festival that month. On August 9, 2013, they released a new album, &quot;Bump&quot;, on GRA Records. Dodd did not participate in the album. In June, Dodd again departed from the Standells for personal reasons. The group (without Dodd) headlined at the Satellite Club in Los Angeles, California, August 9, the Adams Ave. St. Fair, San Diego, California on September 28, and at the Ponderosa Stomp in New Orleans, Louisiana, October 5, 2013.

Dick Dodd died of cancer on November 29, 2013.

The Standells completed an extensive national tour from April 27 through May 21, 2014. It was their first major U.S. tour since the 1960s. The group performed in Parma, Italy, on July 5 for the Festival Beat, and returned to California for the Tiki Oasis on August 17, 2014.

Former band member, Gary Lane (Gary McMillan) died on November 5, 2014, from lung cancer aged 76.

John &quot;Fleck&quot; Fleckenstein died October 18, 2017, of complications of AML Leukemia.
He was also a noted cinematographer.

On October 22, 2022, the Standells biography &quot;From Squeaky Clean to Dirty Water&quot;, written by Larry Tamblyn, was published by Bear Manor Media. On December 23, 2023, Larry Tamblyn was inducted into the California Music Hall of Fame, introduced and officially inducted by his brother, actor Russ Tamblyn.

==Boston connection==
Despite the references to Boston and the Charles River in &quot;Dirty Water,&quot; the Standells are not from Massachusetts. Tower Records producer Ed Cobb wrote the song after a visit to Boston, during which he was robbed on a bridge over the Charles River. None of the Standells had been to Boston before the song was released.

In 1997, &quot;Dirty Water&quot; was decreed the &quot;official victory anthem&quot; of the Red Sox, and is played after every home victory won by the Boston Red Sox. Also, in 1997 two Boston area music-related chain stores celebrated their joint 25th anniversary by assembling over 1500 guitarists, plus a handful of singers and drummers, to perform &quot;Dirty Water&quot; for over 76 minutes at the Hatch Shell adjacent to the Charles River. At short notice, at the invitation of the Red Sox, The Standells played &quot;Dirty Water&quot; before the second game of the 2004 World Series at Fenway Park. The band played at Fenway Park again in 2005 and 2006. In 2007, the Standells performed the national anthem at the first game of the 2007 American League Division Series, also at Fenway Park; the Red Sox swept the Division Series and later the 2007 World Series.

In 2007, &quot;Dirty Water, as sung by the Standells&quot; was honored by official decree of The Massachusetts General Court. The song is now played not only at Red Sox games, but also those of the Boston Celtics, the Boston Bruins, and the Northeastern Huskies&#x27; hockey games. A book &quot;Love That Dirty Water: The Standells and the Improbable Red Sox Victory Anthem&quot; was published.

In April 2019, Liverpool F.C., a club in the English Premier League, began playing &quot;Dirty Water&quot; after home matches, due to the fact that the club is owned by Fenway Sports Group, the same owners as the Boston Red Sox.

<text>The Honda NSX, marketed in North America as the Acura NSX, is a two-seater, rear mid-engined, rear-wheel drive sports car manufactured by Honda.

The origins of the NSX trace back to 1984, with the HP-X (Honda Pininfarina eXperimental) concept, for a V6 rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive sports car. Honda, with the intention of meeting or exceeding the performance of the then V8 engine Ferrari range, committed to the project, aiming at both reliability and a lower price. The concept evolved and had its name changed to NS-X, which stood for &quot;New&quot;, &quot;Sportscar&quot; &quot;eXperimental&quot;, although the production model was launched as the NSX.



== First generation (NA1/2; 1990–2005) ==
The NSX was designed by a team led by Chief Designer Masahito Nakano and Executive Chief Engineer Shigeru Uehara. It benefited from advanced aerodynamics and styling inspired by the F-16 fighter jet cockpit as well as input, during the final development stages, from Formula One World Champion Ayrton Senna.

The NSX was the first general production car to feature an all-aluminium semi-monocoque. It was powered by an all-aluminium 3.0 L V6 engine, which featured Honda&#x27;s VTEC (Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control) system developed in the 1980s, a 5-speed manual transmission, or starting in 1994 the SportShift 4-speed automatic transmission, also known as F-Matic, which allows the option of conventional automatic shifting or manually shifting with a fingertip shift lever on the steering column.

The car was presented at the 1989 Chicago Auto Show. Production started in a purpose-made factory in Japan, for sale from 1990. It was originally available as a &quot;coupé&quot;, then, from 1995 onwards, as a targa top. It underwent a performance upgrade in 1997, which saw the arrival of a larger 3.2 L V6 engine, and a facelift in 2002 where the pop-up headlights were removed. The first-generation NSX was discontinued in 2005. North American models were sold as the Acura NSX. The rarity is that only less than 20,000 were made making it highly expensive.

Cars with the 3.0 L C30A engine are referred to as NA1 models, while the 3.2 L C32B engine cars are known as NA2 models.

== Second generation (NC1; 2016–2022) ==


In December 2007, Acura announced plans to launch a NSX successor by 2010, based on the styling of the front V10-engined Acura ASCC (Advanced Sports Car Concept). Despite prototypes being tested for production, Honda announced, just one year later, that production plans had been canceled due to &quot;poor economic conditions.&quot; Instead, in March 2010, Honda unveiled the HSV-010 GT that participated in the Japanese Super GT Championship. The HSV-010 GT never reached production as a street-legal car.

Reports that Honda was again developing a successor to the NSX re-emerged in April 2011. By December 2011, Honda officially announced a second-generation NSX concept, which was unveiled the following month at the 2012 North American International Auto Show as the Acura NSX Concept.

The production model was displayed three years later at the 2015 North American International Auto Show, for and was released for sale in 2016. 

Although the original name was retained, this time it was defined as &quot;New Sports eXperience&quot;. Unlike the first-generation NSX which was manufactured in Japan, the second-generation NSX was designed and engineered in Marysville, Ohio, at Honda&#x27;s plant, led by Chief Engineer Ted Klaus.

The second-generation NSX has a hybrid electric powertrain, with a 3.5 L twin-turbocharged V6 engine and three electric motors, two of which form part of the SH-AWD (Super Handling-All Wheel Drive) drivetrain, altogether capable of . The transmission is a 9-speed dual-clutch automatic. The car&#x27;s body utilizes a space frame design, which is made from aluminum, ultra-high-strength steel, and other rigid and lightweight materials, some of which are the world&#x27;s first applications.

The first production vehicle with VIN #001 was auctioned off by Barrett Jackson on 29 January 2016. NASCAR team owner Rick Hendrick won the auction with a bid for . The entire bid was donated to the charities Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation and Camp Southern Ground. 

The first NSX rolled off the production line in Ohio on 27 May 2016 and Hendrick was there to drive it off. The first sales of the second-generation NSX in the US were registered in June 2016.

The NSX Type S was revealed on August 12, 2021, with an increase to 602 hp. The Type S is the last update before the November 2022 discontinuation. 300 units only of the NSX Type S were destined for the United States, with 30 units for Japan, and 15 units for Canada.

<doc id="677929" wikidata="Q1570923" url="?curid=677929" title="Half Baked">
<text>Half Baked is a 1998 American stoner film starring Dave Chappelle, Jim Breuer, Harland Williams, and Guillermo Díaz. The film was directed by Tamra Davis, co-written by Chappelle and Neal Brennan and produced by Robert Simonds. &quot;Half Baked&quot; was released in the United States by Universal Pictures on January 16, 1998. It received negative reviews and grossed $17.5 million.

==Plot==
Four lifelong stoners and friends (Thurgood, Scarface, Brian, and Kenny) live together in New York City. Thurgood, a janitor at a medical lab, orders some weed from Samson, the famous local dealer, and the four smoke it. When Kenny, a gentle kindergarten teacher, is out on a munchie run, he is arrested for accidentally killing a diabetic police horse called Buttercup by feeding it junk food. His friends are forced to raise $1 million to bail him out before the other prisoners take advantage of his gentle nature. While visiting Kenny in prison, Thurgood meets Mary Jane and pursues a romantic relationship, which is strained by his having to conceal his marijuana smoking from her, as she is adamantly anti-drug.

Thurgood gets asked one day by a scientist at the lab to get a pound of cannabis from storage and Thurgood freaks out when he realizes what the scientist had him get. The grateful scientist thanks Thurgood for the good deed by giving him some free weed. Thurgood brings it home and the three friends get high. Scarface gets the idea to have Thurgood steal medical marijuana from his work so that the three of them can sell it to raise money to free Kenny.

When the success of the friends&#x27; marijuana business grows enough to raise the ire of local drug lord Samson Simpson, Samson extorts them for $20,000 a week, while Mary Jane dumps Thurgood when she finds out he is dealing drugs. The friends plan a robbery of the medical laboratory to increase their earnings enough to both fend off Samson and free Kenny, but are arrested when they try to execute the plan.

Thurgood strikes a deal with the police to wear a wire to a meeting with Samson in exchange for freeing Kenny and dropping the charges against him and his friends. They meet with Samson, but their plan is exposed when the police detectives fail to arrive as backup since they are high. However, Thurgood and his friends are able to take out Samson&#x27;s henchwomen, and Samson is taken out by the ghost of Jerry Garcia. The police detectives arrive soon after to arrest Samson and his henchwomen, while Thurgood and friends are released from police custody. Thurgood meets with Mary Jane to tell her he is giving up marijuana and wants to get back together. The film ends with their reuniting.

==Cast==
Additionally, co-writer Neal Brennan appears as an employee. Other cameos include: Jon Stewart as the enhancement smoker, Snoop Doggy Dogg as the scavenger smoker, Stephen Baldwin as the MacGyver smoker, Gladys O&#x27;Connor as the grandma smoker, Willie Nelson as the historian smoker, and Tracy Morgan as the V.J. Steven Wright makes an uncredited appearance, as do Janeane Garofalo and Bob Saget.

==Production==
Chappelle and Breuer shared a manager and had previously planned working together on the short-lived TV sitcom &quot;Buddies&quot;. In Spring 1996, both were working separately on marijuana-related film projects. Chappelle and Brennan&#x27;s script was complete, so Breuer was asked to join their project.

The film was shot in Toronto in late 1997. Bob Saget, who directed &quot;Dirty Work&quot;, filmed a short, uncredited cameo for &quot;Half Baked&quot;.

Chappelle asked Harrison Ford to do a cameo in the film but he declined.

==Release==
&quot;Half Baked&quot; was released theatrically in the United States on January 16, 1998, earning $7,722,540 in its opening weekend, ranking at number six. It went on to gross a total of $17,460,020.

==Sequel==
A direct-to-video sequel, &quot;Half Baked: Totally High&quot;, was released on April 16, 2024, by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment on direct-to-video format. The film was directed by Michael Tiddes, and stars Dexter Darden, Moses Storm, Ramona Young, David Koechner, Frankie Muniz, Ash Santos, and Joel Courtney. Rachel True reprises her role as Mary Jane while Harland Williams has a cameo in the boys&#x27; bathroom. The project was a joint-venture production between Universal 1440 Entertainment, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, and STX Entertainment.

==Reception==

Brendan Kelly of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;A couple of hash brownies short of a satisfying cinematic picnic, with far too few comic highs during the bigscreen reefer party.&quot; Martin Musgrave of the Chicago Sun-Times said: &quot;&quot;Half Baked&quot; is a stupid comedy that tries to be something better than it is while maintaining awareness of its own stupidity.&quot;

<doc id="677931" wikidata="Q1752317" url="?curid=677931" title="Tandem">
<text>Tandem, or in tandem, is an arrangement in which two or more animals, machines, or people are lined up one behind another, all facing in the same direction. &quot;Tandem&quot; can also be used more generally to refer to any group of persons or objects working together, not necessarily in line.

The English word &quot;tandem&quot; derives from the Latin adverb , meaning &quot;at length&quot; or &quot;finally&quot;. It is a word play, using the Latin phrase (referring to time, not position) for English &quot;at length, lengthwise&quot;.

== Horse driving ==
When driving horses, &quot;tandem&quot; refers to one horse harnessed in front of another to pull a load or vehicle. A tandem arrangement provides more pulling power than a single horse, such as for pulling a heavy load up a steep hill, out of heavy mud or snow, or pulling heavy loads on narrow tracks or through narrow gates and doorways (too wide for a pair of horses side-by-side). For example, a Brewer&#x27;s van fully loaded with 25 barrels might weigh 8 tons, requiring 2 or 3 horses.

In &quot;carting&quot;, when pulling heavy loads with tandem harness, the &quot;carter&quot; walks to the left of the shaft horse holding its left rein with his right hand, and holding the reins of the lead horse in his left hand.

The harness for the leader (front horse) is slightly different than for the wheeler (rear horse). For instance, the leader doesn&#x27;t have shafts, so shaft holders are not needed, but often there are straps to support the traces (pulling straps) from sagging too low. Any straps running across the back of the leader should be sewn or use special buckles which don&#x27;t leave a loose tab that might catch a rein in it. In carriage driving, the driver should carry a whip long enough to reach the shoulder of the leader.
A &quot;tandem cart&quot; is constructed in the style of a dogcart and used mainly for show, and should be tall enough for the driver to look over the head of the lead horse. A &quot;drayel&quot; is hardware at the tip of the shafts to attach the traces (pulling straps) from the front horse. Alternative to using a drayel, the leader&#x27;s traces are hooked or buckled into the forward end of the wheeler&#x27;s traces.

Driving a tandem is challenging and led to the creation of tandem driving clubs and matches in the 19th century.

Three horses in a row is sometimes called a &quot;randem/random&quot; or &quot;trandem/trandom&quot;.

== Bicycles ==
Tandem bicycles are named for their tandem seating, a more common arrangement than side-by-side &quot;sociable&quot; seating. Tandem bikes are also used in road racing, track racing, and para-cycling.

== Motor vehicles ==

The Messerschmitt KR200 was an example of a very small automobile that used tandem seating; one passenger behind the driver.

&quot;Tandem parking&quot; means parking one car in front of the other.

The word tandem is also used to indicate a semi-trailer truck pulling more than one trailer.

&quot;Tandem axles&quot; means one axle mounted closely in front of another. For trailers, the purpose is to bear heavier loads than a single axle provides.
In heavy trucks, tandem refers to two closely spaced axles. Legally defined by the distance between the axles (up to in the European Union, in the United States), mechanically there are many configurations. Either or both axles may be powered, and often interact with each other. In the United States, both axles are typically powered and equalized; in the European Union, one axle is typically unpowered, and can often be adjusted to load, and even raised off the ground, turning a tandem into a single-axle.

== Aviation ==

The two seating configurations for trainer, night and all-weather interceptor or attack aircraft are pilot and instructor side by side or in tandem. Usually, the pilot is in front and the instructor behind. In attack helicopters, sometimes the pilot sits in back with the weapons operator in front for better view to aim weapons, as the Bell AH-1 Cobra was a tandem cockpit redesign which produced a much slimmer profile than the Bell UH-1 Iroquois on which it was based. Attack aircraft and all-weather interceptors often use a second crew member to operate avionics such as radar, or as a second pilot. Bombers such as the Convair B-58 Hustler seated three crew members in tandem. A common engineering adaptation is to lengthen the cockpit or fuselage to create a trainer with tandem seating from a single-seater aircraft.

=== Side-by-side seating ===

An alternative configuration is side-by-side seating, which is common in civil aircraft of all sizes, trainers and large military aircraft, but less so in high performance jets and gliders where drag reduction is paramount. The Boeing B-47 Stratojet and Boeing XB-52 bombers used fighter-style tandem seating, but the final B-52 bomber series used a conventional side-by-side cockpit. The Grumman A-6 Intruder, General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark, Sukhoi Su-24, and the Sukhoi Su-34 are examples of combat aircraft that use this configuration. For training aircraft, it has the advantage that pilot and instructor can see each other&#x27;s actions, allowing the pilot to learn from the instructor and the instructor to correct the student pilot. The tandem configuration has the advantage of being closer to the normal working environment that a fast jet pilot is likely to encounter.

In some cases, such as the Northrop Grumman EA-6B Prowler, a two-place aircraft can be lengthened into a four-place aircraft. Also, a single seat cockpit can be redesigned into a side-by-side arrangement in the case of the Douglas A-1 Skyraider, TF-102 trainer or the Hawker Hunter training versions.

== Insects ==
During mating among odonata (dragonflies and damselflies), a male uses claspers at the end of his abdomen to grab a female between the head and thorax, forming a tandem. The pair may take flight while in tandem.

<text>Cramton Bowl is a 21,000-seat stadium located in Montgomery, Alabama. Cramton Bowl opened in 1922 as a baseball stadium and has been home to Major League Baseball spring training and to minor league baseball. Today, however, its primary use is for American football.

It is the host of the annual Salute to Veterans Bowl (formerly the Camellia Bowl) for the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS); the FCS Kickoff, an annual season-opening game in the Division I Football Championship Subdivision; and of Montgomery&#x27;s five high school squads. It was previously home to the former Blue–Gray Football Classic, a collegiate all-star game usually played on Christmas Day, the Alabama State Hornets football team, and hosted the first ever football game played under the lights in the South.

==Stadium history==

Cramton Bowl is named for Fred J. Cramton, a local businessman who donated the land on which the stadium is built. After a conversation with friends about the need for a baseball stadium, Cramton donated his sanitary landfill to the city so a facility could be constructed there. The city held the land for a time and then returned it, stating that Cramton&#x27;s stadium idea was too big of a project for the city to undertake. Cramton then decided to take matters into his own hands; with the help of the Junior Chamber of Commerce, Cramton raised $33,000 to build the sports venue.

Seating capacity was expanded in 1929 to 7,991. More additions were made in 1946, increasing the seating capacity to 12,000. East stands were added in 1962 bringing the seating capacity up to 24,000. After new renovations were completed in July 2011 the capacity was reduced to 21,000. The stadium&#x27;s modern boundaries are Madison Avenue (north); Hall Street (east); Pelham Street (south); and buildings and Hilliard Street (west).

==Baseball==

The first baseball game played on the new field was in May 1922 between Auburn University and Vanderbilt University. Shortly after its completion in 1922, the Philadelphia Athletics decided to move their spring training operations from Eagle Pass, Texas to Montgomery. They used the facility for their 1923 and 1924 spring training and exhibition games before moving to a newer stadium in Fort Myers, Florida.

After the departure of the Philadelphia Athletics spring training, Minor League Baseball&#x27;s newly formed Southeastern League placed a team in Montgomery which became known as the Montgomery Lions. The Lions played in Cramton Bowl from 1926 to 1930. There was no team from 1931 to 1936 due to problems within the Southeastern League and the ongoing negative economic effects of the Great Depression. The team returned for the 1937 season as the Montgomery Bombers and garnered their first major league baseball affiliation with the Cleveland Indians. The Indians pulled out for the 1938 season and were replaced by the Philadelphia Phillies. After one season the Phillies dropped their affiliation; the team became a co-op franchise and were renamed the Montgomery Rebels. In 1943, the Rebels would disband due to the manpower shortage caused by World War II. On July 11 of that year, the Chattanooga Lookouts moved their home games to Cramton Bowl to play out the rest of the season. The Lookouts managed to move back to Chattanooga and reverse the trend of declining attendance sometime later in the 1940s. The Rebels returned in 1946 through 1949 before moving to the newly constructed Paterson Field located just across the street.

The eighth and deciding game of the 1943 Negro World Series was held at the Cramton Bowl, with the Homestead Grays defeating the Birmingham Black Barons, 8–4.

==Football==
On September 23, 1927, Cramton Bowl became the site of the first game played &quot;under the lights&quot; in the South with Cloverdale taking on Pike Road High School. Former superintendent D. H. &quot;Sarge&quot; Caraker remembers fondly, &quot;[We] used dishpans for reflectors and sent to California for the lamps. We drew 7,200 people from all over the South to see it.&quot;

===College football===
Cramton Bowl was host to all home games for Alabama State Hornets football prior to ASU&#x27;s construction of an on-campus stadium in 2012 and was the host to all home games for the Faulkner University Eagles football team until 2012 when Faulkner University constructed its own facility. It was also home to the Turkey Day Classic and in 2009 hosted the inaugural HBCU All-star Bowl.

Cramton Bowl also provided a location for Alabama Crimson Tide football home games in the capital city. The Crimson Tide played home games at Cramton Bowl in the 1922 through 1932 seasons, in 1934, from 1944 through 1946 and again from 1951 through 1954. Alabama&#x27;s all-time record at Cramton Bowl was 17 wins and 3 losses.

Cramton Bowl probably achieved its greatest fame as the home of the Blue–Gray Football Classic, an annual college football all-star game which was held there each December from 1938 until 2001.

Beginning in 2014, Cramton Bowl began hosting the Camellia Bowl, a college football bowl game with tie-ins with the Sun Belt Conference and Mid-American Conference. The game was renamed the Salute to Veterans Bowl in 2024.

In 2017, the stadium became the regular host of the FCS Kickoff, a season-opening Division I FCS game operated by ESPN and nationally televised on one of ESPN&#x27;s networks.

In October 2020, Cramton Bowl was announced as the host stadium for the Montgomery Bowl, a one-off bowl game played in December 2020, during the pandemic.

===High school football===
Several area high schools call Cramton Bowl home including the Johnson Abernathy Graetz Jaguars, Percy Julian Phoenix, Park Crossing High School Thunderbirds, and Carver Wolverines. In July 2011, Cramton Bowl hosted the Alabama High School Athletic Association Alabama All-Stars Sports Week football game.

==2011 renovations==
By the start of the 21st century, Cramton Bowl was widely regarded as being functionally obsolete for major sporting events. The stadium&#x27;s relatively small capacity was not a concern as much as its age and condition. The stadium was not well maintained for most of its history, and by the dawn of the new millennium, it was actually crumbling. These issues were factors, although not the predominant ones, in the Blue-Gray Game not being held in 2002 and its subsequent relocation in 2003 to Troy University&#x27;s Veterans Memorial Stadium, about 50 miles (80 km) from Montgomery.

In mid-2010 the City of Montgomery approved a measure for a $10 million renovation and addition to Cramton Bowl. The renovations planned for Cramton Bowl were a unique mix of the old and the new. The old structure was revamped and updated with four entrances, a state-of-the-art press box, an aesthetically enhanced plaza area, and a &quot;Walk of Fame,&quot; which celebrates Montgomery&#x27;s sports history and houses various articles of historic sports memorabilia. Perhaps the most important and impressive addition was the multi-purpose sports facility. Demolition of the north end zone and press box began in late November 2010, which was phase one of the project. Phase two began in early January 2011 as crews removed an existing brick wall from the south end zone and dismantled the scoreboard to make way for the new multi-purpose sports facility. Work on the stadium was completed in 2011 while the new multi-purpose facility was finished in 2012.

<doc id="677950" wikidata="Q3423633" url="?curid=677950" title="Canadian Firearms Registry">
<text>The Canadian Firearms Registry () is the gun registry of Canada, requiring the registration of all restricted and prohibited firearms in the country. It is managed by the Canadian Firearms Program of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) as part of the RCMP&#x27;s responsibilities under the &quot;Firearms Act&quot;.

The registry was introduced by the Liberal government of Prime Minister Jean Chrétien in 1993 and implemented by successive justice ministers Allan Rock and Anne McLellan. The net annual operating cost of the program was originally estimated to be $2 million.

Originally, the program required the registration of all non-restricted firearms but this requirement was dropped on April 6, 2012, by the coming into force of Bill C-19. Bill C-19 also mandated the destruction of the non-restricted records of the registry as soon as feasible. The province of Quebec immediately filed a request for an injunction to prevent the destruction of the data. A temporary injunction was granted by the Superior Court of Quebec on April 5, 2012 to prevent the data for Quebec residents from being destroyed until legal arguments could be heard. On March 27, 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in &quot;Quebec (AG) v Canada (AG)&quot; that the destruction of long-gun registry records was within the constitutional power of Parliament to make criminal law, denying the Government of Quebec&#x27;s legal challenge and allowing for those records to be destroyed.

==History==
Canada had a gun registry during the Second World War, when all people were compelled to register their firearms out of fear of enemy subversion. This registry in Canada was discontinued after the war; however, all handguns (restricted) have been subject to registration since 1934. In addition, fully automatic firearms have been prohibited (with grandfathering exemptions to existing, licensed collectors of full-automatic weapons and theatrical users) since 1977. A Firearms Acquisition Certificate (FAC) was required to purchase any firearm since its implementation in 1977, although additional restrictions applied for handguns (restricted - 1934) and fully automatic firearms (prohibited −1977). To obtain an FAC, no training was required until the Canadian Firearms Safety Course and Test program (non-restricted, restricted, or combined courses/tests) was created as a prerequisite in Bill C-17 in 1991. This formal training, once common in families and even schools, has been credited with the marked reduction of accidents involving the improper handling of firearms. Under bill C-17 (1991), and subsequent legislation and/or orders in council, short-barreled handguns and those firing .25 ACP and .32 ACP ammunition, and all handguns with a barrel length under 105mm (~4.1&quot;), with the exception of certain guns typically used in shooting competitions, were added to the list of prohibited firearms. In addition, a large reclassification of firearms was made to place many firearms with certain cosmetic and functional characteristics into the category and registration of &#x27;restricted&#x27; or &#x27;prohibited&#x27; firearms. Some classes of these firearms have also been subject to grandfathering provisions of the law to owners and collectors, including some limited allowances of willing/gifting certain prohibited firearms to a family member to preserve them for historic value as pre-1945 collectors pieces.

The École Polytechnique massacre—a mass shooting incident on December 6, 1989, in which Marc Lépine used a Mini-14 rifle to shoot 28 people, including 14 women killed, before committing suicide—sparked a substantial rise in activism to tighten Canada&#x27;s gun licensing and registry legislation. The first steps toward the Canadian long-gun registry began under the federal Progressive Conservative Party government of Prime Minister Kim Campbell. It was the child of former Conservative Senator Nathan Nurgitz, who wrote then Prime Minister Campbell requesting all guns be registered.
*May 1990 – Justice Minister Kim Campbell introduces Bill C-80, which improves the FAC screening process, defines safe storage, bans some military weapons and large-capacity magazines, but, notably, does not ban semi-automatic rifles such as the Ruger Mini-14, register non-restricted firearms, or control the sale of ammunition.
*November 1990 – In an almost unprecedented turn of events, because of opposition in Kim Campbell&#x27;s own Conservative caucus, Bill C-80 fails second reading and is sent to a &quot;Special Committee.&quot;
*November 1990 – February 1991 – The Special Committee on Bill C-80 conducts hearings.
*March 1991 – Parliament prorogues and Bill C-80 dies on the order paper.
*April 1991 – Student activists from l&#x27;École Polytechnique, along with family members of the victims of the massacre, police organizations, health care professionals, organized labor, and others banded together with the existing Canadians for Gun Control organization to form the Coalition for Gun Control. The Coalition holds its first national press conference in Ottawa with representatives from the Canadian Police Association, Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, the Victims of Polytechnique, the Canadian Criminal Justice Association, and others calling on the Government to reintroduce gun-control legislation.
*May 1991 – Justice Minister Kim Campbell unveils Bill C-17, a revised version of Bill C-80. The first witness, the Minister of Justice, argues that the Standing Committee on Justice and the Solicitor General do not need to conduct extensive hearings but should send the bill back to the House of Commons for third reading. Gun organizations push for hearings in an effort to weaken the bill. Gun-control advocates push for hearings in order to strengthen the bill. The National Action Committee on the Status of Women storms the hearings, arguing that women have the right to be heard, and the bill is subsequently sent to the Standing Committee on Justice and the Solicitor General.
*May–September 1991 – The Legislative Committee hears witnesses on both sides. This time,the Coalition for Gun Control appears with support from health-care, crime-prevention and other experts. Its position is endorsed by over 50 groups and 5000 individuals. The Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women recommends improvements to the bill to counter problems with guns in domestic violence. Both the Canadian Police Association and Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police advocate registration of all firearms. In response to an advertising campaign by the gun lobby, the Coalition issues a joint statement in support of Bill C-17, with additional measures such as registration of all firearms. The statement is signed by hundreds of community leaders, chiefs of police, and violence-prevention organizations and issued to all MPs and Senators. A campaign by the Coalition lands over 300,000 postcards on MPs&#x27; desks, calling for amendments to strengthen the law. The Liberal and NDP parties support the position of the Coalition for Gun Control advocating licensing of firearm owners and registration of firearms.
*November 7, 1991 – The House of Commons passes Bill C-17. Members of all four political parties acknowledge the efforts of the Coalition for Gun Control.
*November–December 1991 – The Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs reviews the legislation. Priscilla DeVilliers, whose daughter Nina was killed months earlier, and John Bickerstaff, whose son Lee was accidentally killed by a friend playing with his father&#x27;s service revolver, testify.
*December 5, 1991 – Bill C-17 passes Senate. Legal and Constitutional Affairs Chair, Senator Nathan Nurgitz, writes to Justice Minister Kim Campbell advising her to look carefully at the regulations and to registration of all firearms.

===Bill C-68===
The &quot;Firearms Act&quot; was created by Bill C-68, &quot;An Act Respecting Firearms and Other Weapons&quot;, which was introduced in 1993, and aimed at the licensing of all gun owners and registration of all firearms. The bill also classified replica firearms as prohibited devices, with those already owned being grandfathered. It was passed by Parliament and given Royal Assent in 1995. The Canadian Firearms Centre was established in 1996 to oversee the administration of its measures.

The registration portion of the &quot;Firearms Act&quot; was implemented in 1995 and the deadline for gun owners to register their non-restricted firearms was January 1, 2003. There is disagreement on the percentage of gun-owners who complied with the registry. The Law-Abiding Unregistered Firearms Association estimated that over 70% of all firearms in Canada were never registered. Meanwhile, the Coalition for Gun Control claimed that ninety per cent of all gun owners registered their firearms, representing ninety percent of guns.

==Debate on the registry==

===Initial opposition===
Political opposition to the registry, particularly outside of Canada&#x27;s major cities, was immediate. The provincial governments of Alberta, Ontario, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador also attacked the bill arguing it exceeded the federal government&#x27;s mandate and arguing that it was too expensive; however the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the registry in Reference re Firearms Act.

The Conservative Party of Canada campaigned for many years to repeal portions of the registry related to non-restricted firearms and did so on April 5, 2012.

===Cost overruns===
The registry again became a political issue in the early 2000s when cost overruns were reported.

In early 2000, the Canadian Firearms Program released a report that showed that implementation costs were rising. Major backlogs in registration—largely as a result of firearm owners waiting until the last minute to apply—general increase in costs, fee waivers for early applications, and high error rates in applications submitted by firearm owners were all cited as contributing factors to the rising costs.

In December 2002, the Auditor General of Canada, Sheila Fraser, reported that the project was running vastly above initial cost estimates. The report showed that the implementation of the firearms registry program by the Department of Justice has had significant strategic and management problems throughout. Taxpayers were originally expected to pay only $2 million of the budget while registration fees would cover the rest. In 1995, the Department of Justice reported to Parliament that the system would cost $119 million to implement, and that the income generated from licensing fees would be $117 million. This gives a net cost of $2 million. At the time of the 2002 audit, however, the revised estimates from the Department of Justice were that the cost of the whole gun control program would be more than $1 billion by 2004-05 and that the income from licence fees in the same period would be $140 million.

Information technology expenditures were disproportionally high especially throughout the program’s early development. However, the program was not
exceptional compared to other government-run programs with large IT projects. A 2006 report by the Auditor General regarding large IT Projects demonstrates that after more than a full decade of IT projects had passed within the government since its last IT audit, and whereby a TB Framework had been developed for IT, only two of the seven large IT projects assessed met all audit criteria for well-managed projects. When CFP was merged into the RCMP in 2006, IT comprised almost 50% of total program expenditures – the industry standard is 20-30%. By 2009, costs had stabilized to 21-27% of direct program expenditures and were expected to be reduced further within the existing RCMP IT architecture.

===Allegations of improper lobbying===
In January 2006, Tony Bernardo, director of the 12,000-member Canadian Shooting Sports Association, asked the RCMP to probe a Liberal Party consultant over a $380,000 contract that was awarded to lobby the federal government for funds for the ailing firearms registry. The five-month contract was awarded by the Justice Department in March 2003 to lobby the federal Solicitor General, Treasury Board and Privy Council, according to a detailed lobbyist report. No formal probe by the RCMP resulted. Bernardo asked rhetorically, &quot;[isn&#x27;t it] inappropriate for the Federal Government to hire a private lobbyist with taxpayers&#x27; dollars to lobby itself?&quot;

===Effects on public safety===
There are conflicting views on the effectiveness of the Gun Registry from a public safety standpoint.

In a Canada Firearms Centre (CAFC) survey, 74% of general duty police officers stated that the registry &quot;query
results have proven beneficial during major operations.&quot;.

However, the Auditor General&#x27;s report found that the program did not collect data to analyze the effectiveness of the gun registry in meeting its stated goal of improving public safety. The report states:

The performance report focuses on activities such as issuing licences and registering firearms. The Centre does not show how these activities help minimize risks to public safety with evidence-based outcomes such as reduced deaths, injuries and threats from firearms.

Former Ontario Provincial Police Commissioner Julian Fantino opposed the gun registry, stating in a press release in 2003:

We have an ongoing gun crisis including firearms-related homicides lately in Toronto, and a law registering firearms has neither deterred these crimes nor helped us solve any of them. None of the guns we know to have been used were registered, although we believe that more than half of them were smuggled into Canada from the United States. The firearms registry is long on philosophy and short on practical results considering the money could be more effectively used for security against terrorism as well as a host of other public safety initiatives.&quot; However, in 2010, the OPP had representation on the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police(CACP)&#x27;s Special Subcommittee on Firearms, from January–August 2010, and voted in favour of retaining the long gun registry at the CACP AGM.

Meanwhile, Edgar MacLeod, former president of the CACP, states that &quot;while the cost of the registry had become an embarrassment, the program works and provides a valuable service. In a typical domestic violence situation,&quot; he says, &quot;investigating police officers rely on the registry to determine if guns are present. Onboard computers in police cruisers, or a call to central dispatch, alerts [sic] officers to any firearms registered to occupants of the house.&quot;

The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police are strongly supportive of the gun registry, claiming that getting rid of the registry will make Canada less safe, and compromise the ability of law enforcement to deal effectively with gun violence. However, support for the registry among Chiefs of Police is not unanimous. There have also been serious questions raised regarding donations made to the CACP by CGI Group, the corporation behind the registry. These donations were partially responsible for the resignation of ethicist Dr. John Jones from the CACP&#x27;s ethics committee. Furthermore, the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police has been criticized for suppressing opposition to the registry among its own law enforcement officers. These allegations have been disputed.

There is also debate as to whether frontline police officers oppose the registry. Opponents of the registry cite an online straw poll to suggest 92% regular officers believe that the registry is ineffective and should be dismantled; that poll, conducted by Cst. Randy Kuntz of the Edmonton Police Service, was open to active police members only through an online forum in a popular police-related magazine where respondents were all confirmed Canadian police officers. In addition to this, Cst. Kuntz solicited input from members of police forces across Canada through various means of advertising to promote awareness of this poll. After approximately fourteen months, 2631 Canadian police officers (of about 69,000 total, or 3.8%) responded to this survey. Of the 2631 respondents, 2410 voted to scrap the registry. Meanwhile, an RCMP report shows 81% of police officers are in favour of the registry.

A survey in August 2010 revealed that 72 percent of Canadians believe the long-gun registry has done nothing to prevent crime. Organizations like the Canadian Taxpayers Federation have circulated petitions to end the registry and have collected tens of thousands of signatures supporting the elimination of the registry.

In April 2011, a survey was conducted by the Edmonton Police Association. Its members voted 81 percent in favour of scrapping the long-gun registry.

The coming into force of Bill C-19 removes the requirement to register &#x27;non-restricted&#x27; firearms. All firearms classified as &#x27;restricted&#x27; or &#x27;prohibited&#x27; by law and orders in council in 1934, 1977, 1991, 1996, and subsequently would remain registered and unchanged. A Possession and Acquisition Licence (PAL), and the prerequisite course and exam, is mandatory to purchase or possess any firearm. Hunter education programs are a requirement of all hunters in Canada.

===Privacy and security issues===
The information contained in the firearms registry is available to police through the Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC). This database is one of many applications which are protected under the National Police Service Network (NPSN).

In a 2001 Access to Information Request, the RCMP explained that they do not record statistics on which applications are targeted by hackers. As a result, they do not know how many times the Canadian Firearms Program (CFP) database has been breached. Chief Superintendent David Gork, Departmental Security Officer, is quoted as saying, CPIC is but one of many applications that are protected on the NPSN (National Police Service Network) and attacks on the network cannot be broken down as to which application is the intent of the attack. In general, attacks are to gain access through the protective measures, and from there to &#x27;look around&#x27; for opportunities as to where the attacker &#x27;can go&#x27;. Therefore there are no stats that are collected that would indicate where any attacks are directed with the NPSN.

In his final response to the Access to Information request, the Information Commissioner concluded, During the course of our investigation, my investigator met with officials from the RCMP and was provided with a detailed and comprehensive explanation regarding the department&#x27;s security systems. They confirmed that CPIC is one of many applications protected within the National Police Service Network and there is no way of determining what application is being targeted, if an unauthorized access is being attempted.

John Hicks, an Orillia-area computer consultant, and webmaster for the Canada Firearms Centre, has said that anyone with a home computer could have easily accessed names, addresses and detailed shopping lists (including make, model and serial number) of registered guns belonging to licensed firearms owners. Hicks told the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (OFAH) that &quot;During my tenure as the CFC webmaster I duly informed management that the website that interfaced to the firearms registry was flawed. It took some $15 million to develop and I broke inside into it within 30 minutes.&quot;

The Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters questioned the security of the gun registry after a home invasion that seemed to target a licensed gun collector. The OFAH argued that, in the wrong hands, a database detailing the whereabouts of every legally-owned firearm in Canada is a potential shopping list for criminals.

In response to these privacy and security claims, the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, the Canadian Police Association, and the Canadian Association of Police Boards released a joint statement claiming that, &quot;The CFP&#x27;s national database has never been breached by hackers. Information is safe and secure.&quot;

==Usage==
The RCMP Canadian Firearms Program produces a quarterly report called &quot;Facts and Figures&quot;. The information most often quoted in the media is the total number of queries, in the section entitled Average Daily Queries to the CFRO (Canadian Firearms Registry On-line). This number is what is commonly used to determine how often the registry is accessed by police officers. Changes to the system and the level of automation have resulted in the total number of queries increasing dramatically since the RCMP began tracking these numbers in 2003.
*2003 – 1,813;
*2004 – 2,087;
*2005 – 4,101;
*2006 – 6,650;
*2007 – 7,109;
*2008 – 9,606;
*2009 – 11,347;
*2010 – 14,729;
*2011 – 17,782;
*2012 – 18,555

As of June 2010, the CFRO is reportedly accessed 14,012 times per day. Only 530 (3.7%) of those &quot;hits&quot; are specific to firearms registration (licence number, serial number and certificate number). The remaining 13,482 (96.3%) are automatically generated every time an address is checked or a licence plate is verified. Officers claim that these automatic checks are valuable to them since they now know if the person or address whom they are researching has registered firearms and where they are. Officers claim that they feel safer knowing about present firearms when addressing a call, specifically in rural regions with domestic violence calls.

While there is reliable information to suggest how many times per day police officers access the firearms registry, the mostly non-automatic inclusion of this information in vehicle and address reports, whereby police must specifically request the information, is considered by many to be a valuable policing tool.

==Current status==
The Conservative minority government that was elected in both 2006 and 2008 had a platform calling for a repeal of portions of the registry, but did not successfully alter legislation on the registry. However, the government brought forward regulatory changes to bring in an amnesty for rifle and shotgun owners facing prosecution for failing to register their firearms. The government extended this one-year amnesty four times, with the most recent amnesty having expired on May 16, 2011.

In 2009, the Conservative government supported a Private Member&#x27;s Bill (C-391) which proposed to repeal the portion of the requirement requiring the registration of non-restricted firearms, but would have continued the registration requirement for guns classified as restricted. Despite every other party leader in the House of Commons opposing the bill, Bill C-391 passed second reading in the House of Commons in November 2009 by a vote of 164 to 137 due to eight Liberal MPs, 12 New Democrats and one independent voting with the minority Conservative government.

In response to Liberal MPs breaking party ranks to support Bill C-391, Liberal Opposition Leader Michael Ignatieff announced on April 19, 2010, that Liberal MPs would be whipped to vote against C-391 and other proposals by the Conservative government to kill the long-gun (non-restricted) portion of the registry, with the condition that the party will instead support a reduction in the severity of penalties for those who fail to successfully register. The NDP did not enforce a party stance on parliamentary votes regarding the registry in relation to Bill C-391, as it was a Private Member&#x27;s Bill. A third reading on September 22, 2010, failed to pass by a narrow margin (153 to 151). Six NDP MPs and the Conservative caucus favoured the bill, while the remaining NDP MPs, the Liberal Party and the Bloc Québécois opposed it.

The Conservatives won a majority in the 2011 election; during the campaign, party leader Stephen Harper reiterated his party&#x27;s support for eliminating registration of non-restricted long guns.

On October 25, 2011, the government introduced Bill C-19, legislation to remove the requirement to register non-restricted firearms. The bill additionally mandated the destruction of all records pertaining to the registration of non-restricted firearms currently contained in the Canadian Firearms Registry and under the control of the chief firearms officers. The bill passed second reading in the House of Commons (156 to 123). On February 15, 2012, Bill C-19 was passed in the House of Commons (159 to 130) with support from the Conservatives and two NDP MPs. On April 4, 2012, Bill C-19 passed third reading in the Senate by a vote of 50–27 and received royal assent from the Governor General on April 5.

Upon passage of Bill C-19, the Province of Quebec moved for a motion to prevent the destruction of the Quebec portion of the records. A temporary injunction was granted on April 5, 2012 in order to leave enough time for proper legal arguments to be heard. On March 27, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled against Quebec, allowing the destruction of the long-gun registry records.

On September 8, 2014, an appeal by the Barbra Schlifer Clinic to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice to rule that the withdrawal of the non-restricted firearms registration requirement was unconstitutional was denied. The applicants sought to show that the removal of the registration requirement denied women their rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms to: &quot;life, liberty and security of the person&quot;. In its judgment the court ruled that there was not sufficient evidence to conclude that the registration of non-restricted firearms had been of any measurable benefit to women and that statistically rates of firearms-related violence had been following a trend downward before the requirement was introduced and had not changed after the requirement had been withdrawn.

<text>Troy University is a public university in Troy, Alabama, United States. It was founded in 1887 as Troy State Normal School within the Alabama State University System, and is now the flagship university of the Troy University System. It was one of about 180 &quot;normal schools&quot; founded by state governments in the 19th century to train teachers for the rapidly growing public common schools. Some closed but most steadily expanded their role and became state colleges in the early 20th century and state universities in the late 20th century. 

Troy University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACS) to award associate, baccalaureate, master&#x27;s, education specialist, and doctoral degrees.

In August 2005, Troy State University, Montgomery; Troy State University, Phenix City; Troy State University, Dothan; and Troy State University (main campus) all merged under one accreditation to become Troy University. Prior to the merger, each campus was independently accredited. The merger combined staff, faculty, and administrators into a single university.

Today, the university serves the educational needs of students in four Alabama campuses and 60 teaching sites in 17 U.S. states and 11 countries. Troy University has over 100,000 alumni in 50 states of the U.S. and in other countries.

==History==

Troy University is a public university with its main campus located in Troy, Alabama. It was founded as a normal school in 1887 with a mission to educate and train new teachers. Laura Montgomery Henderson was one of the school&#x27;s original teachers.

Over time, the school evolved into a four-year college and in 1957 the Alabama Board of Education adopted the name &quot;Troy State College&quot; and granted it the right to issue master&#x27;s degrees. In the 1960s the college opened satellite sites in Montgomery, Phenix City, and Dothan to serve the military personnel posted at Maxwell AFB, Fort Benning (now Fort Moore), and Fort Rucker (now Fort Novosel). More sites associated with military centers located throughout the United States and abroad followed in the subsequent decades, as well as support centers for students and alumni unrelated to the military. As a leader in online education, Troy University began offering online courses in the Fall Semester of 1997. Troy University is known for its innovation in offering in-class and online academic programs in servicing traditional, nontraditional, and military students. In spring 2018, Troy University was ranked #19 among the &quot;Most Innovative Schools&quot; in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; annual peer assessment survey. The main campus enrollment as of the fall of 2016 is 7,911 students. The campus consists of 36 major buildings on plus the adjacent Troy University Arboretum.

At least three prominent political figures have been associated with Troy University. George Wallace Jr., son of the late Governor George C. Wallace, who was a former administrator at the university. Max Rafferty, the California Superintendent of Public Instruction from 1963 to 1971, was dean of the education department from 1971 until his death in 1982. Former Governor John Malcolm Patterson taught U.S. history at the institution during the 1980s.

===Name change===
On April 16, 2004, the board of trustees voted to change the name of the institution from Troy State University to Troy University. The transition to the new name was completed in August 2005 and was the fourth in the school&#x27;s history. When created by the Alabama Legislature on February 26, 1887, it was officially named the Troy State Normal School. The school was located in downtown Troy until moving to the present location on University Avenue in 1930. In 1929, the name was changed to Troy State Teachers College and it subsequently conferred its first baccalaureate degree in 1931. In 1957, the legislature voted both to change the name to Troy State College and to allow it to begin a master&#x27;s degree program. The name was changed once again in 1967 to Troy State University.

==Troy University System==
The Troy University System (formerly known as the Troy State University System) is a public university system in Alabama that coordinates and oversees the three branch universities of Troy University. The system was formed in 1982, as the campuses in Dothan and Montgomery were granted independent accreditation status. In April 2004, &quot;State&quot; was dropped from the university&#x27;s name to reflect the institution&#x27;s new, broader focus. In August 2005, all Troy campuses were unified under one accreditation.

Troy University has a total of four campuses located across the state of Alabama:
* Troy University (main campus)
* Troy University at Montgomery
* Troy University at Dothan
* Troy University at Phenix City

In addition to the four campuses, there are also 23 additional support sites across the southeastern United States and other countries.

==Academics==
Troy University cumulatively offers 46 bachelor&#x27;s degree programs, 22 master&#x27;s degree programs, and 3 doctoral programs.

===Organization===
The university is composed of five colleges, a graduate school, and a division of general studies:

*College of Arts &amp; Sciences
*College of Communications &amp; Fine Arts
*College of Education
*College of Health &amp; Human Services
*The Sorrell College of Business
*The Graduate School
*The Division of General Studies

===Confucius Institute===
Established in 2007, the Confucius Institute at Troy University is a public institution affiliated with the Ministry of Education of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, funded and arranged in part by Hanban, which is itself affiliated with the Chinese government, and the stated aim of which is to promote the Chinese language and culture, support local Chinese teaching, and facilitate cultural exchanges. The institute also offers summer camps for high school students, consultation for economic development, and promotion of Chinese outreach programs. Some have expressed concerns related to academic freedom and political influence of the Chinese government specially regarding such things as the comment of a former senior Chinese official, Li Changchun that Confucius Institutes are &quot;an important part of China&#x27;s overseas propaganda set-up&quot;. Troy University was the first college in Alabama to open a Confucius Institute. The institute was closed in March of 2023.

===Center for International Programs===
The university has over 800 international students from 75 countries on the main campus, and offers special programs for students such as the English as Second Language Center (ECL). Troy also has a dormitory named Pace Hall.

===Rankings===

Troy University has acquired different institutional rankings from various sources:

*In 2019, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Troy as the 640th-best school in the nation. &quot;Forbes&quot;″ overall ranking centers on the value of the degree obtained by a university&#x27;s students and measures, in part, the marketplace success of a school&#x27;s graduate.
*&quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in several categories for Regional Universities, South Region, for 2020:
==Campus==
Troy University&#x27;s main campus is located near downtown Troy. The campus sits along rolling hills with many old oak trees present along the streets and throughout campus. The first two buildings that were built on campus were John Robert Lewis Hall (formerly Bibb Graves Hall) and Shackelford Hall, both of which are still standing on campus today. Bibb Graves, who was Alabama&#x27;s governor at the time of the building&#x27;s dedication, is remembered for commissioning the Olmsted Brothers architectural firm of Brookline, Massachusetts, to design the campus landscape plan. The Troy University Board of Trustees voted to rename the hall in John Lewis&#x27;s honor on August 26, 2020.

Across from the chapel is a very small lake named Lake Lagoona, which is the drainage point of the creek that runs through the Trojan Oaks Golf Course.

The Trojan Oaks Golf Practice Course, which used to be full-service, 9-hole, 3,211-yard golf course, is one of the pristine features of the campus with its rolling hills, oak and pine trees, and a creek running through most of the course. Troy was one of only 87 universities in the United States to have operated a full-service golf course on its own campus before closing the course and revamping it into a golf practice facility, and is still one of the few schools to operate a 9-hole or greater practice course on its campus.

One of the favorite features of the campus is Janice Hawkins Park, which features an amphitheater, walking trails, a lagoon and several prominent art installations. Paved sidewalks curve throughout that park, and a pedestrian bridge straddles the lagoon on one end. Among the art installations are the &quot;Violata Pax Dove&quot;, by the artist Fred &quot;Nall&quot; Hollis, and 200 replica terracotta warriors that are spread throughout the park, representing the famous excavations in China.

==Student life==

in 2017, TrojanVision was ranked as the #1 Best College TV Station by the Southeast Journalism Conference (SEJC).

===The &quot;Sound of the South&quot; marching band===
The Sound of the South is the official marching band of Troy University. The marching band was established in 1939 and has been referred to by its current name since 1965. The band was named by John M. Long soon after he was hired as band director. The band, now boasting over 300 members on a regular basis, has enjoyed major success in performing at hundreds of marching band competitions, as well as dozens of different college and professional athletic venues. The band usually follows the football team to almost every away game, and has a smaller pep-band that plays at every home basketball game. It was during the thirty-two year tenure of Johnny Long, as he was commonly referred to, that the band program at Troy University established a prominent national reputation through its many featured appearances at music conventions, concert tours and recordings with the symphony band, as well as several nationally televised appearances with the &quot;Sound of the South&quot; Marching Band. The band&#x27;s &quot;trademark&quot; piece that is played before every performance of the band is called &quot;The Fanfare&quot; and was written by John M. Long in 1965.

==Athletics==

Troy State Normal School began its sports program in 1909, when it fielded its first football team. Through the early years, Troy&#x27;s athletics nicknames were not official and varied by the sport and the coach. Eventually, teams all began to use the name &quot;Troy State Teachers&quot;, but when the athletic teams moved into NAIA competition, the nickname was then changed to the &quot;Red Wave&quot;. In the early 1970s, the student body voted to change the name to Trojans after many felt that Red Wave was too similar to the University of Alabama&#x27;s nickname, the Crimson Tide. Prior to becoming a member of NCAA Division I athletics in 1993, Troy University was a member of the Gulf South Conference of the NCAA Division II ranks. Troy&#x27;s primary rivals were Jacksonville State University, Livingston University (now the University of West Alabama), and the University of North Alabama. In 2004, Troy joined the Sun Belt Conference of the Football Bowl Subdivision.

===Football===

Troy University began playing football in 1909. The program has won three national championships, the NAIA national football championship in 1968, and the NCAA Division II national football championship in 1984 and 1987. Troy transitioned to the NCAA&#x27;s Division I-A in 2001, became a football only member of the Sun Belt Conference in 2004, and joined the conference for all other sports in 2005. In 2001, Troy defeated Mississippi State at Scott Field in Starkville, Mississippi, by a score of 21–9 which was the Trojans&#x27; first victory over a BCS level program. In 2004, the Trojans defeated a ranked BCS program for the first time ever, defeating #17 Missouri 24–14 at home on ESPN2. The Trojan football team made its first bowl game appearance in the Silicon Valley Football Classic on December 30, 2004, but lost to Northern Illinois, 34–21. In 2006, Troy won the Sun Belt Conference for the first time after defeating Middle Tennessee State toward the end of the 2006 season. Troy represented the Sun Belt Conference in the 2006 New Orleans Bowl as the conference champion for the first time where the Trojans defeated the Rice Owls of Conference USA by a score of 41–17. Troy participated in the 2010 New Orleans Bowl where the Trojans routed Ohio by a score of 48–21. Troy has most recently participated in the 2023 Birmingham bowl in Birmingham , Alabama, which the Trojans lost to Duke 10–17. That same year the Trojans became back-to-back Sun Belt Conference champions after beating Appalachian State 49-23 and Costal Carolina the previous year 45-26. 
Former Troy football head coach Larry Blakeney served 25 seasons as head coach between 1990 and the end of the 2014 season. He has led the program to three Southland Football Conference titles and five Sun Belt Conference titles, as well as guided the Trojans to seven FCS playoff appearances and five FBS bowl games. Blakeney boasts an overall record of 178–113–1 as head coach at Troy. Blakeney is the winningest coach in the Troy University history and he is the 4th-winningest collegiate coach all time in the state of Alabama, only behind Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant, Cleve Abbott, and Ralph &quot;Shug&quot; Jordan. Blakeney is one of two coaches in college football history to be the head coach of a football program during its transition from Division II to I-A (the other being UCF&#x27;s Gene McDowell).

===Basketball===
The Troy University men&#x27;s basketball team was under the direction of head coach Don Maestri for 31 years until his retirement in 2013. Coach Maestri is the winningest coach in school history, with exactly 500 career wins, and he has won numerous conference coach-of-the-year awards during his tenure at Troy University. The program has won 11 conference championships in basketball, with six of them coming in the Division I era. On January 12, 1992, Troy defeated DeVry University of Atlanta by the score of 258–141 (or 253–141, according to some journalists). This is the highest-scoring game in NCAA basketball history and Troy State&#x27;s score of 258 is the highest score in NCAA basketball history. The Trojans competed in the 2003 NCAA Tournament in Nashville against Xavier University after winning the Atlantic Sun Conference title. In 2004, Troy was an NIT participant in a match-up against Niagara University. In 2008, coach Maestri was inducted into the Wiregrass Sports Hall of Fame at a ceremony in Dothan, Alabama. In 2009, the Trojans finished 3rd place in the Sun Belt Conference and competed in the CBI against College of Charleston. After winning the Sun Belt regular-season title in 2010, the Trojans would be invited to play in the NIT once again against Ole Miss. Maestri is a member of the Troy University Sports Hall of Fame.


===Baseball===
The Troy University baseball team won two Division II national championships in 1986 and 1987 under the leadership of coach Chase Riddle. One of Troy&#x27;s biggest victories in baseball came in April 1998 when the Trojans knocked off the #3 nationally ranked University of Alabama Crimson Tide by a score of 8–4 at Riddle-Pace Field on the Troy campus. Under the direction of current head coach Bobby Pierce, the Trojan baseball program has competed in the NCAA Baseball Tournament in 2006 and 2007. Troy also competed in the 1995 and 1997 NCAA Division One tournament under head coach John Mayotte. In 1999, the program tied the NCAA Division I record for most hits in the 6th inning, belting 14 hits (in the 6th) in a 34–4 rout of Stetson.

===Rodeo===
The program&#x27;s governing body is the National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association. The rodeo program&#x27;s home facility is the Pike County Cattlemen&#x27;s Arena in Troy where it hosts a three-day rodeo each October that features college rodeo programs from throughout the southern region of the United States. Troy University calf roper Ben Mayworth won the 2007 national title in Casper, Wyoming, at the National Finals Collegiate Rodeo.

===Women&#x27;s soccer===
The Troy University women&#x27;s soccer team began in 2003 when the stadium, Jesse H. Colley Track/Soccer Stadium, was first constructed, seating 500. Later, in 2010, the stadium was renovated to include a press box to be used by both the track and soccer team. The field, costing around $1 million to build, measures about 115 yards by 75 yards. The team plays in the Sun Belt Conference, along with: South Alabama, Georgia State, Coastal Carolina, Appalachian State, Georgia Southern, Arkansas State, Louisiana, Texas State, Little Rock, and ULM. Though, they are currently last in the east division with four conference points, compared to the leader&#x27;s, South Alabama&#x27;s, twenty-four points. Currently the team is led by head coach Ged O&#x27;Connor, and assistant coaches Nicole Waters and the new addition Kayla Saager. Ged O&#x27;Connor, hired in January 2017, is just the seventh head coach in this program&#x27;s history. O&#x27;Connor had prior experience to coaching from being the head coach of the Saint Leo University women&#x27;s soccer team for eleven seasons. Furthermore, Nicole Waters will enter her third season with the Troy University women&#x27;s soccer program come fall of 2021. Before Troy, Waters was a graduate assistant at Mercer University for two seasons. She is a Canada native, but after her collegiate career at Dayton, coach Waters played professionally at FC Slovacko Zeny of the Czech Republican league. The newly hired Kayla Saager joined the Trojans in 2020. Her soccer experience includes playing at three colleges in her career (NC State, West Virginia, and Binghamton). Saager will be held responsible for coaching the Troy University&#x27;s attacking side, specifically.

==Campus academic features==
===Hall of Fame of Distinguished Band Conductors===
The Hall of Fame of Distinguished Band Conductors was established on the campus of what was then known as Troy State University in Troy, Alabama by the National Band Association in 1979. The Hall of Fame contains the picture and biographies of band directors who have distinguished themselves in some way or who have made significant contributions to the field of band directing, conducting, or leadership.

===The Manuel H. Johnson Center for Political Economy===
Troy University&#x27;s Manuel H. Johnson Center for Political Economy was formed in September, 2010 as the result of a $3.6 million gift from Troy alumnus Dr. Manuel H. Johnson, BB&amp;T, and the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation. The center&#x27;s mission is the advancement of free market economic ideas and its research and teaching efforts explore the idea that economic freedom improves the quality of life for citizens. The new center is part of the university&#x27;s Sorrell College of Business and it is housed inside Bibb Graves Hall. Dr. Scott Beaulier served as the center&#x27;s executive director from 2010 to 2015.

===University libraries===
The libraries on the Dothan, Montgomery, and Troy campuses house collections of more than 300,000 volumes, hundreds of thousands of eBooks, and over 250 databases. The Troy University Library on the Troy campus is a Federal Depository Library.

===Janice Hawkins Cultural Arts Park===
The Janice Hawkins Cultural Arts Park is a park on the Troy University campus that features an amphitheater, walking trails, a lagoon and the International Arts Center, which houses two art galleries and an interpretive center known as Warriors Unearthed. In addition, there are 200 replica terracotta warriors designed by the artist Huo Bao Zhu that are displayed throughout the park in exhibits representing the historic excavations in China. It is built in the honor of Mrs. Janice Hawkins.

===Center for Materials and Manufacturing Sciences===
The university was recently awarded a $3.2 million grant from NIST to establish the Center for Materials and Manufacturing Sciences, a facility for research in recycling of plastic materials. The establishment of the center will facilitate and enhance Troy University&#x27;s partnership with the local plastic recycling industry in order to increase competitiveness in the marketplace. This will assist in improving and increasing job creation in Pike County. The assistance of Senator Shelby (R-Ala) was instrumental in obtaining the funding for this venture.

<text>Pesher (; , pl. pesharim), from the Hebrew root meaning &quot;interpretation,&quot; is a group of interpretive commentaries on scripture. The &quot;pesharim&quot; commentaries became known from the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls. The &quot;pesharim&quot; give a theory of scriptural interpretation of a number of biblical texts from the Hebrew Bible, such as Habakkuk and Psalms.

The authors of &quot;pesharim&quot; said that scripture is written in two levels; the surface level for ordinary readers with limited knowledge, and the concealed level for specialists with higher knowledge. The Habakkuk Pesher (1QpHab) said that God has made known to the Teacher of Righteousness, a prominent figure in the history of the Essene community, &quot;all the mysteries of his servants the prophets&quot; (1QpHab VII:4–5).

== Types ==
There are two types of &quot;pesharim&quot; found in the dead sea scrolls: &quot;Continuous pesharim&quot; and &quot;Thematic pesharim.&quot;

=== Continuous ===
The first type of pesharim, &quot;continuous pesharim&quot;, go through specific biblical books and quote the book phrase by phrase; after each quotation, an interpretation of the verse is added. There are 15 continuous pesharim that have been found and dated, including: five on Isaiah (4Q161, 4Q162, 4Q163, 4Q164, 4Q165); three on the Psalms (1Q16, 4Q171, 4Q173); and seven on books of the Minor Prophets (1QpHab on Habakkuk; 1Q14 on Micah; 1Q15 and 4Q170 on Zephaniah; 4Q166 and 4Q167 on Hosea; 4Q169 on Nahum). Below is an example of &quot;continuous pesharim&quot; from 1QpHab:
&quot;Behold the nations and see, marvel and be astonished; for I accomplish a deed in your days, but you will not believe it when told&quot; [Hab 1.5].

=== Thematic ===
The other type of pesharim, &quot;Thematic pesharim&quot;, are similar to &quot;continuous pesharim&quot; in that they comment on and cite from biblical verses, but &quot;thematic pesharim&quot; focus on a particular theme (eg. &quot;the end of days&quot;) and pull from multiple biblical books as opposed to commenting on books verse by verse. In these texts, scriptural books were connected and therefore a passage or verse in one book, could be interpreted or clarified by passages or verses found either later in the same book, or even another text. An example of &quot;thematic pesharim&quot; is text 4Q174, which is known as Florilegium. This scroll discuses several biblical texts including: 2 Sam 7, Ps 1 &amp; 2, Exod 15, Ezek 37, Isa 8 &amp; 65, and Amos. It looks at these texts with messianic implications and characterizes the Davidic Messiah as God&#x27;s son.

==Historic individuals==
The Pesharim (plural) contain references to a number of individuals and groups throughout their interpretation of the texts. As the Pesharim refer to specific events and make mention of these specific individuals, the Pesharim are important in understanding Qumran&#x27;s history and culture during the times that their authors lived. Below are the most prominent individuals and groups cited.

Teacher of Righteousness: The Teacher of Righteousness is spoken of, referred to, and cited in many of the Pesharim, including the Damascus Document, the Habakkuk Commentary, the Commentary on the Psalms, and many others. The Teacher of Righteousness is the main spiritual leader of the Essenes at Qumran, and his exact identity is unknown. The Teacher of Righteousness is believed by many scholars to have been the author of some of the texts found at Qumran, such as the &quot;Teacher Hymns&quot;. Throughout the Pesharim, the &#x27;interpreter&#x27; who writes the Pesher can be seen identifying biblical individuals as if they are actually The Teacher of Righteousness, such as the passage found in the Psalms 37 portion of the &quot;Commentaries on Psalms&quot; which states;

&quot;&quot;I have been young, and now I am old, but I have not seen a righteous man abandoned and his children begging food&lt;br&gt;All the time he is lending generously, and [his] chil[dren] are blessed (37:25–26)&lt;br&gt;[This] refers to the Teacher of [Righteousness . . ]&quot; (4Q171 Col.3)&quot;

Wicked Priest: The Wicked Priest is the Teacher of Righteousness&#x27;s main opponent, who also sought to kill the Teacher of Righteousness. The identity of the Wicked Priest is more clear than that of the Teacher of Righteousness, with scholars suggesting that he was a Hasmonean high priest such as Jonathan Apphus or Alexander Jannaeus. The Wicked Priest is referenced the most in the Commentary on Habukkuk, which states that the Wicked Priest was originally reliable, but once he became ruler he forsook God for riches and rebelled against God and committed abhorrent deeds. In the Commentary on the Psalms, the Wicked Priest sought to kill the Teacher of Righteousness for sending a law to him; some scholars have suggested that this law was 4QMMT. If the Wicked Priest was in fact Jonathan, then he met his own end in 142 BCE at the hands of Diodotus Tryphon, which would match well with the Habakkuk Commentary that comments on the terrible end met by the Wicked Priest.

Man of Mockery: The Teacher of Righteousness also had opponents with regard to interpretation of scripture and the law who grew out of the Qumran community&#x27;s own ranks. The Man of Mockery is one such individual who rejected the Teacher of Righteousness&#x27;s claims, withdrew himself from the group, and took some followers with him. These were then referred to as the Men of Mockery.

The Man of Lie: The Teacher of Righteousness&#x27;s opponent was also called the Man of Lie. According to the Pesher on Psalms, this individual is prophesied in scripture and was indeed successful in leading people astray.

Kittim: A group called the Kittim is mentioned in several Pesharim, including &quot;Apocalypse of Weeks, Pesher on Isaiah, Pesher Habakkuk,&quot; and &quot;Pesher Nahum.&quot; The Kittim are usually identified as the Romans. The Kittim are portrayed as Gentiles who will play a role in the great wars of the end times.

== Themes ==
Within the &quot;pesharim&quot; found at Qumran, different themes occur within separate texts.

Salvation

The Pesher on Psalms has the theme of salvation, focusing on those who are wrongdoers in the eyes of God and how those who do good will see the rewards of life. For instance, 4Q171 Fragment 1 insists that as a devoted believer you shall respect the Law, and those who don&#x27;t will not be saved. &quot;Renounce your anger and abandon your resentment, don&#x27;t yearn to do evil, because evildoers will be wiped out&quot; (37:8–9a). Such interpretations of the psalms assign them a deeper meaning and connect them to all human beings, splitting those who are good from those who are not.

Apocalyptic

Apocalyptic themes also exist within the Pesharim. Several interpretations with apocalyptic themes are found in these commentaries from Qumran. These include &quot;Pesher Isaiah&quot; and &quot;Pesher Habakkuk,&quot; which talk about the fate of Israel&#x27;s enemies and several other apocalyptic events. Topics of particular interest for modern scholars interpreting the Dead Sea Scrolls include the origin of belief in an apocalyptic war near the end of time, and identification of the enemy in such a war.

Several scholars have investigated similarities between beliefs found in early Christian communities and those expressed by the Qumran community. For example, Stephen Goranson compares the Dead Sea Scrolls with the Apocalypse of John. The War Scroll and the Apocalypse of John, which both use apocalyptic language, differ sharply in their views of the apocalyptic war.

<text>The &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class was a group of light cruisers built for the United States Navy during World War II. They were the most numerous class of light cruisers ever built. Fifty-two were ordered, and 36 were completed, 27 as cruisers and nine as the of light aircraft carriers. They were deactivated within a few years after the end of the war, but six were converted into missile ships, and some of these served into the 1970s. One ship of the class remains as a museum ship.

==Development==
A development of the preceding , the &quot;Cleveland&quot; class was designed with increased cruising range, anti-aircraft armament, and torpedo protection compared with earlier U.S. cruisers.

After the London Naval Treaty of 1930, the U.S. Navy took up a renewed interest in the 6-inch gun-armed light cruiser, partially due to the Navy complaining about the 8-inch gun&#x27;s slow rate of fire of three rounds per minute compared to the ten rounds per minute of 6-inch guns. At this time, the U.S. Navy began to deploy drones to use as targets for anti-aircraft targets, which could simulate both dive and torpedo bombers. The simulations showed that without fire control directors and computers, the ships of the fleet would be almost helpless against the density of aircraft attacks envisioned in any future war. Mechanical computers alone could weigh up to 10 tons and had to be housed below decks for both weight and protection measures. As World War II was to prove, the pre-war assumptions were optimistic as eventually, every anti-aircraft gun platform above 20 mm would end up having remote power, with fire control and radar aiming.

As designed, the &quot;Cleveland&quot; class was already a tight design, but requests to widen the ship were turned down as it would affect production rates. Shortly after the Fall of France, the Two-Ocean Navy Act changed those production rates rapidly. In order to fit the new heavier fire control and radar systems within the allotted tonnage for a cruiser, the No. 3 gun turret was omitted. This also gave room for the enlargement of the bridge spaces to accommodate the new combat information center and necessary radars, along with enough tonnage to fit an additional pair of 5-inch/38 twin mounts, located fore and aft of the superstructure, with wider arcs of fire. Despite the loss of three 6-inch guns compared to the preceding &quot;Brooklyn&quot; and &quot;St. Louis&quot; classes, the more advanced fire control gave the &quot;Cleveland&quot; class a firepower advantage in practical use.

Towards the end of World War II, the increase of light anti-aircraft weapons made the class top-heavy, so to compensate, some ships had one of the two catapults, and No. 1 turret rangefinders removed. Top weight issues would plague the class with every addition of equipment having to be weighed against what would have to be removed. For example, the tighter installation of the control radar necessitated the removal of the 20 mm clipping rooms, where 20 mm rounds were loaded into their magazines.

===Subclasses===
Fifty-two ships were originally planned, but nine of them were completed as the light aircraft carriers of the , and two were completed to a different design, with a more compact superstructure and a single stack, called the . Of the 27 &quot;Cleveland&quot; class commissioned, one () was completed as a guided missile cruiser, and five were later modified as and guided missile cruisers. Two of each of these had enlarged superstructures to serve as flagships. Following the naming convention at the time, all the ships completed as cruisers were named for U.S. cities or towns.

==Service==
The &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class cruisers served mainly in the Pacific Fleet during World War II, especially with the Fast Carrier Task Force, and some served off the coasts of Europe and Africa in the U.S. Atlantic Fleet. All of these warships, though worked heavily, survived the war. All were initially decommissioned by 1950, except for , which remained in service until 1956. None were recommissioned for the Korean War, as they required a crew almost as large as the ships, so those were reactivated instead. All non-converted ships were sold off from the reserve fleet for scrapping beginning in 1959. The six that were completed as or converted into guided missile cruisers were reactivated during the 1950s and then served into the 1970s. All, particularly the Talos-armed ships, suffered from greater stability problems than the original design due to the extra top weight. This was particularly severe in &quot;Galveston&quot;, leading to its premature decommissioning in 1970. and had to have a large amount of ballast and internal rearrangement to allow service into the 1970s. The last of these missile ships in service, &quot;Oklahoma City&quot;, was decommissioned in December 1979.

===Museum ship===
One &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class ship remains. The , refit in 1960 and re-designated as &quot;Galveston&quot;-class guided missile light cruiser CLG-4 (later CG-4), is now a museum ship at the Buffalo and Erie County Naval &amp; Military Park in Buffalo, New York, alongside the , and the , .

<text>A cryptosystem is considered to have information-theoretic security (also called unconditional security) if the system is secure against adversaries with unlimited computing resources and time. In contrast, a system which depends on the computational cost of cryptanalysis to be secure (and thus can be broken by an attack with unlimited computation) is called computationally secure or conditionally secure.

== Overview ==

An encryption protocol with information-theoretic security is impossible to break even with infinite computational power. Protocols proven to be information-theoretically secure are resistant to future developments in computing. The concept of information-theoretically secure communication was introduced in 1949 by American mathematician Claude Shannon, one of the founders of classical information theory, who used it to prove the one-time pad system was secure. Information-theoretically secure cryptosystems have been used for the most sensitive governmental communications, such as diplomatic cables and high-level military communications.

There are a variety of cryptographic tasks for which information-theoretic security is a meaningful and useful requirement. A few of these are:
# Secret sharing schemes such as Shamir&#x27;s are information-theoretically secure (and also perfectly secure) in that having less than the requisite number of shares of the secret provides no information about the secret.
# More generally, secure multiparty computation protocols often have information-theoretic security.
# Private information retrieval with multiple databases can be achieved with information-theoretic privacy for the user&#x27;s query.
# Reductions between cryptographic primitives or tasks can often be achieved information-theoretically. Such reductions are important from a theoretical perspective because they establish that primitive formula_1 can be realized if primitive formula_2 can be realized.
# Symmetric encryption can be constructed under an information-theoretic notion of security called entropic security, which assumes that the adversary knows almost nothing about the message being sent. The goal here is to hide &quot;all functions&quot; of the plaintext rather than all information about it.
# Information-theoretic cryptography is quantum-safe.

== Physical layer encryption ==
=== Technical limitations ===
Algorithms which are computationally or conditionally secure (i.e., they are not information-theoretically secure) are dependent on resource limits. For example, RSA relies on the assertion that factoring large numbers is hard.

A weaker notion of security, defined by Aaron D. Wyner, established a now-flourishing area of research that is known as physical layer encryption. It exploits the physical wireless channel for its security by communications, signal processing, and coding techniques. The security is , , and quantifiable (in bits/second/hertz).

Wyner&#x27;s initial physical layer encryption work in the 1970s posed the Alice–Bob–Eve problem in which Alice wants to send a message to Bob without Eve decoding it. If the channel from Alice to Bob is statistically better than the channel from Alice to Eve, it had been shown that secure communication is possible. That is intuitive, but Wyner measured the secrecy in information theoretic terms defining secrecy capacity, which essentially is the rate at which Alice can transmit secret information to Bob. Shortly afterward, Imre Csiszár and Körner showed that secret communication was possible even if Eve had a statistically better channel to Alice than Bob did.
The basic idea of the information theoretic approach to securely transmit confidential messages (without using an encryption key) to a legitimate receiver is to use the inherent randomness of the physical medium (including noises and channel fluctuations due to fading) and exploit the difference between the channel to a legitimate receiver and the channel to an eavesdropper to benefit the legitimate receiver.
More recent theoretical results are concerned with determining the secrecy capacity and optimal power allocation in broadcast fading channels.
There are caveats, as many capacities are not computable unless the assumption is made that Alice knows the channel to Eve. If that were known, Alice could simply place a null in Eve&#x27;s direction. Secrecy capacity for MIMO and multiple colluding eavesdroppers is more recent and ongoing work, and such results still make the non-useful assumption about eavesdropper channel state information knowledge.

Still other work is less theoretical by attempting to compare implementable schemes. One physical layer encryption scheme is to broadcast artificial noise in all directions except that of Bob&#x27;s channel, which basically jams Eve. One paper by Negi and Goel details its implementation, and Khisti and Wornell computed the secrecy capacity when only statistics about Eve&#x27;s channel are known.

Parallel to that work in the information theory community is work in the antenna community, which has been termed near-field direct antenna modulation or directional modulation.
It has been shown that by using a parasitic array, the transmitted modulation in different directions could be controlled independently.
Secrecy could be realized by making the modulations in undesired directions difficult to decode. Directional modulation data transmission was experimentally demonstrated using a phased array.
Others have demonstrated directional modulation with switched arrays and phase-conjugating lenses.

That type of directional modulation is really a subset of Negi and Goel&#x27;s additive artificial noise encryption scheme. Another scheme using pattern-reconfigurable transmit antennas for Alice called reconfigurable multiplicative noise (RMN) complements additive artificial noise.
The two work well together in channel simulations in which nothing is assumed known to Alice or Bob about the eavesdroppers.

== Secret key agreement ==
The different works mentioned in the previous part employ, in one way or another, the randomness present in the wireless channel to transmit information-theoretically secure messages.
Conversely, we could analyze how much secrecy one can extract from the randomness itself in the form of a secret key.
That is the goal of &quot;secret key agreement&quot;.

In this line of work, started by Maurer and Ahlswede and Csiszár, the basic system model removes any restriction on the communication schemes and assumes that the legitimate users can communicate over a two-way, public, noiseless, and authenticated channel at no cost. This model has been subsequently extended to account for multiple users and a noisy channel among others.

<text>The Container Security Initiative (CSI) a.k.a. the 24-Hour Rule was launched in 2002 by the U.S. Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP), an agency of the Department of Homeland Security. Its purpose was to increase security for container cargo shipped to the United States. As the CBP puts it, the intent is to &quot;extend [the] zone of security outward so that American borders are the last line of defense, not the first.&quot;

==Rationale==
Containerized shipping is a critical component of international trade. According to the CBP:

* About 90% of the world&#x27;s trade is transported in cargo containers.
* Almost half of incoming U.S. trade (by value) arrives by containers on board ships.
* Nearly seven million cargo containers arrive on ships and are offloaded at U.S. seaports each year.

As terrorist organizations have increasingly turned to destroying economic infrastructure to make an impact on nations, the vulnerability of international shipping has come under scrutiny. Under the CSI program, the screening of containers that pose a risk for terrorism is accomplished by teams of CBP officials deployed to work in concert with their host nation counterparts.

==CSI core elements==

CSI consists of four core elements:

* Using intelligence and automated information to identify and target containers that pose a risk for terrorism.
* Pre-screening those containers that pose a risk at the port of departure before they arrive at U.S. ports.
* Using detection technology to quickly pre-screen containers that pose a risk.
* Using smarter, tamper-evident containers.

The initial CSI program has focused on implementation at the top 20 ports shipping approximately two-thirds of the container volume to the United States. Smaller ports, however, have been added to the program at their instigation, and participation is open to any port meeting certain volume, equipment, procedural, and information-sharing requirements. Future plans include expansion to additional ports based on volume, location, and strategic concerns.

Much of the original idea behind the CSI program stemmed from the work of James Giermanski, who was an early proponent of Supply Chain Security.

==Global impact==
The CSI program offers its participant countries the reciprocal opportunity to enhance their own incoming shipment security. CSI partners can send their customs officers to major U.S. ports to target ocean-going, containerized cargo to be exported from the U.S. to their countries. Likewise, CBP shares information on a bilateral basis with its CSI partners. Japan and Canada are currently taking advantage of this reciprocity.

CSI has also inspired and informed global measures to improve shipping security. In June 2002, the World Customs Organization unanimously passed a resolution that will enable ports in all 161 of the member nations to begin to develop programs along the CSI model. On 22 April 2004, the European Union and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security signed an agreement that calls for the prompt expansion of CSI throughout the European Community.

<doc id="677977" wikidata="Q6900341" url="?curid=677977" title="The Reason (Celine Dion song)">
<text>&quot;The Reason&quot; is a song by Canadian singer Celine Dion, recorded for her fifth English-language studio album, &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot; (1997). It was written by Carole King, Mark Hudson and Greg Wells, and produced by Sir George Martin. &quot;The Reason&quot; was released as the second single from the album in selected European countries on 24 November 1997 by Columbia and Epic Records. In France, it was issued as a double A-side single with &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;. Its music video was directed by Scott Lochmus, featuring Dion recording the song in a studio.

==Background and release==
Carole King wrote this song first for the band Aerosmith.

Dion performed &quot;The Reason&quot; during her Let&#x27;s Talk About Love Tour, and as a duet with Carole King on VH1 Divas and at the 48° Festival di Sanremo on 1998 in Italy. On that occasion she also performed &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;.

The track was included later on &quot;The Collector&#x27;s Series, Volume One&quot; in 2000 and &quot;My Love: Ultimate Essential Collection&quot; European edition in 2008.

The recording of this song was included as a bonus on the &quot;Au cœur du stade&quot; DVD.

From 2011 to 2014, &quot;The Reason&quot; was included in the set list of Dion&#x27;s Las Vegas show, &quot;Celine&quot;. The song was also performed in Dion&#x27;s 2017 tour and 2018 tour. &quot;The Reason&quot; was performed by Dion during her BST Hyde Park concert in London on 5 July 2019. The song was also performed during the first two US shows of Dion&#x27;s Courage World Tour in 2019.

Carole King recorded also her own version of this song for her 2001 album &quot;Love Makes the World&quot;, this time with Dion on backing vocals.

==Critical reception==
A reviewer from &quot;Music Week&quot; gave &quot;The Reason&quot; three out of five, stating that &quot;Celine is back in classic power ballad territory here, though this track lacks the mega hooks of her previous hits. More of an album taster than a Christmas number one.&quot; &quot;The New York Observer&quot; editor Jonathan Bernstein reviewed, &quot;It kicks off in time-honored fashion with a bombastic power ballad, &quot;The Reason&quot;, co-written by Carole King and produced by Sir George Martin. Thus, straight away, we find the inherent wrongheadedness of this record. Carole King hasn&#x27;t written a memorable song in many a year and-hello?-didn&#x27;t George Martin recently announce that he was quitting the producing racket because his hearing was going? The latter affliction was probably incurred by a silent prayer offered up during the recording of &quot;The Reason&quot; to be struck deaf&quot;. &quot;Smash Hits&quot; gave it four out of five, writing, &quot;&#x27;The Reason&#x27; starts off as you&#x27;d expect — all soft and lovely — then in come the strings and Celine steps up a gear. It all builds up into one of those huge production numbers with our fave Canadian warbler wailing over the top like she &quot;really&quot; means it. There ain&#x27;t many people out there on Planet Pop that can do &#x27;em like Celine! It&#x27;s big, it&#x27;s Christmassy and we love it! Top five.&quot;

==Retrospective response==
Pip Ellwood-Hughes from Entertainment Focus noted that the song &quot;immediately reminds you of why Dion has become such a powerhouse.&quot; He added that &quot;it highlights how she can pack power and emotion into everything she sings.&quot; Bob Waliszewski of &quot;Plugged In&quot; felt that &quot;The Reason&quot; celebrate&#x27;s love &quot;and the affection of a good man&quot;. Christopher Smith from TalkAboutPopMusic declared the song as &quot;a typical Celine mid-tempo ballad with plenty of high notes for Celine to hit and re-establish her presence.&quot;

==Music video==
The accompanying music video for &quot;The Reason&quot; was directed by Scott Lochmus and released in December 1997. It shows the recording of the song in the studio.

<text>Richard Jago (1 October 1715 – 8 May 1781) was an English clergyman poet and minor landscape gardener from Warwickshire. Although his writing was not highly regarded by contemporaries, some of it was sufficiently novel to have several imitators.

==Life==
Richard Jago was the third son of the Rector of Beaudesert, Warwickshire, and was named after him. His father&#x27;s family was of Cornish origin, while his mother was from the immediately adjoining village of Henley in Arden. He was educated at Solihull School, where one of its five houses is now named after him. While there he formed a lifelong friendship with William Shenstone.

In 1732, he went up to University College, Oxford and while there Shenstone made him acquainted with other students with a literary taste. He took his master&#x27;s degree 9 July 1738, having entered into the church the year before, and served the curacy of Snitterfield, Warwickshire, near Stratford upon Avon. In 1744, he married Dorothea Susanna Fancourt, daughter of the rector of Kimcote in Leicestershire, whom he had known from her childhood. In 1751 his wife died, leaving him with the care of seven very young children. Three of these were boys, who predeceased him, but he was eventually survived by three of his daughters. In 1759, he married a second wife, Margaret Underwood, but had no children by her.

Jago had become vicar of Harbury in 1746, and shortly after of Chesterton, both in Warwickshire. Through aristocratic patrons, he was given the living of Snitterfield in 1754, and later was presented with his former father-in-law&#x27;s living in Kimcote in 1771, after which he resigned the livings of Harbury and Chesterton, keeping the others. Snitterfield remained his favourite residence and it was there that he would die at the age of 66.

Jago shared with Shenstone an interest in landscape gardening and occupied himself with making improvements to the Snitterfield vicarage garden. Both became part of the likeminded circle about Henrietta Knight, Lady Luxborough which also included other literary friends, William Somervile and Richard Graves, rector of Claverton. Shenstone dedicated a bench to Jago at the end of the viewing circuit near his house, The Leasowes, and both dedicated poems to each other.

==Poetry==
Jago&#x27;s first independent publications were two sermons. The first, &quot;The Cause of Impenitence Considered&quot; (1755), was published for the benefit of Harbury Free School; the second was a funeral sermon, &quot;The nature and grounds of a Christian&#x27;s happiness in and after death&quot; (1763). Shenstone&#x27;s letters mention an Essay on Electricity written by Jago, written in 1747, but this seems to have remained unpublished.

Poems of his were also beginning to appear in Robert Dodsley&#x27;s anthologies, &quot;Collection of Poetry by several hands&quot;, among which the sentimental elegy &quot;The Blackbirds&quot; had made something of a stir after it first appeared in the ephemeral magazine &quot;The Adventurer&quot; in 1753. This was a lament on the death of a self-sacrificing blackbird and was shortly followed by similar poems on goldfinches and swallows. They were particularly praised by Dr. John Aikin in his &quot;Essay on the application of Natural History to poetry&quot;, who also noted that there were soon imitations among other minor poets, including Samuel Jackson Pratt&#x27;s &quot;The Partridges, an elegy&quot; (1771) and James Graeme&#x27;s &quot;The Linnet&quot; (1773).

Jago&#x27;s most ambitious publication was the four-part topographical poem, &quot;Edge Hill, or the rural prospect delineated and moralised&quot; (1767). It was written in blank verse and was once described as &quot;the most elaborate local poem in our language&quot;. The poet takes his stance on the hill in the morning, facing south-west (book 1); at noon he is on Ratley Hill in the centre (books 2–3) and then moves along the ridge to look north-east at evening. The poem intermingles description with legendary, historical and antiquarian particulars, principally the battle at the start of the English Civil War. Imaginary excursions are made to Warwick, Coventry, Kenilworth, Solihull, and industrial Birmingham (under the name Bremicham), as well as many &quot;flattering descriptions of all the great houses and seats of important people which come within his survey&quot;. Local rivers are also included and even the nearby canal on which &quot;sooty barks pursue their liquid track&quot;. There are many digressions as well, including descriptions of industrial processes and of the nature of vision and the working of the telescope.
The critic already quoted finds the poem &quot;really interesting; with the scene before us, it is impossible not to admire the ingenuity and scrupulous thoroughness with which the author has performed his task,&quot; although ultimately it is lacking in poetic execution. The &quot;Cambridge History of English and American Literature&quot; judges that &quot;his catalogues have little picturesqueness or colour; while his verse, although it is not without the accent of local association, is typical, as a whole, of the decadence of the Miltonic method of natural description in the 18th century. Every group of trees is a grove, every country house a dome, and every hill a precipice&quot;. Particular examples of hackneyed diction include Latin-derived adjectives, as in &quot;Honington&#x27;s &quot;irriguous&quot; meads&quot;, or else 18th century circumlocutions such as &quot;the woolly tribes&quot; when sheep are meant. Nevertheless, the poem seems to have inspired the writing of the much shorter and simpler &quot;Ode to Lansdowne Hill&quot; (1785), which celebrates the site of another Civil War battle.

In the following year Jago published &quot;Labour and Genius, or the mill-stream and the cascade&quot;, a humorous fable in octosyllabic verse written in memory of William Shenstone and his landscaped grounds at the Leasowes. Poems of lesser significance appeared here and there and Jago was working on a revised edition of his collected poems just before his death. This appeared posthumously as &quot;Poems, Moral and Descriptive&quot; in 1784. Included there was another homage to Milton in the oratorio &quot;Adam, or the fatal disobedience, compiled from Milton&#x27;s Paradise Lost and adapted to music&quot;. The rhymed choruses there were of Jago&#x27;s composition, but the main body of the work is adapted directly from Paradise Lost. Though it found no composer to set it, another of Jago&#x27;s pieces did. This was the &quot;Roundelay for the Stratford Jubilee&quot; organised by David Garrick in 1769, which was set for singing by Charles Dibdin.

One other humorous piece also found an imitator. In Jago&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&#x27;s soliloquy imitated&quot;, a minor poet agonises over whether &quot;to print or not to print&quot; and run the danger, by submitting his verses to Dodsley, to &quot;lose the name of author&quot;. A subsequent parody titled &quot;The Presbyterian parson&#x27;s soliloquy&quot; over the question to &quot;conform or not conform&quot; appeared in &quot;The Hibernian Magazine&quot; in 1774 and was often reprinted thereafter, ascribed to Samuel Badcock. One later commentator gave it as his opinion that &quot;the hint of this parody was probably borrowed from Mr Jago&#x27;s&quot;. Slight Jago&#x27;s output may have been, but it appears to have been influential in its time.

<text>Oncidium, abbreviated as Onc. in the horticultural trade, is a genus that, , contains about 340 species of orchids from the subtribe Oncidiinae of the orchid family Orchidaceae. It is distributed across tropical and subtropical America from Mexico, Central America and the West Indies to northern Argentina, with one species (&quot;O. ensatum&quot;) extending into Florida. Common names for plants in this genus include dancing-lady orchid and golden shower orchid.

A 2008 molecular phylogenetic study labeled the &quot;Oncidium&quot; alliance &quot;grossly polyphyletic.&quot; In the same year, the American Orchid Society labeled the genus a &quot;dumping ground&quot;. A consensus announced in April 2013 resulted in major taxonomic changes to &quot;Oncidium&quot;, &quot;Gomesa&quot;, &quot;Odontoglossum&quot;, &quot;Miltonia&quot;, and others. Much of this debate and subsequent housekeeping was initiated by significant research for the scientific publication &quot;Genera Orchidacearum&quot; Volume 5. As a result, much of the information in this article is now deprecated, but still of great value. One significant change is the move of most Brazilian &quot;Oncidium&quot; with a fused lateral sepal to the genus &quot;Gomesa&quot;. The Royal Horticultural Society system, the World Checklist of Monocots database and the American Orchid Society have updated their databases to reflect most of these changes.

==Description==

This genus was first described by Olof Swartz in 1800 with the orchid &quot;Oncidium altissimum&quot;, which has become the type species. Its name is derived from the Greek word ὀγκος, &quot;onkos&quot;, meaning &quot;swelling&quot;. This refers to the callus at the lower lip.

Most species in the genus are epiphytes (growing on other plants), although some are lithophytes (growing on rocks) or terrestrials (growing in soil). They are widespread from northern Mexico, the Caribbean, and some parts of South Florida to South America. They usually occur in seasonally dry areas.

They can be divided into three categories, according to their growth pattern:
* Some have green pseudobulbs and long racemes with small flowers and a dominant lip. They are mostly golden yellow with or without reddish-brown barring, but some are brown or yellowish-brown. Other &quot;Oncidium&quot; species have white and pink blooms, while some even have startling, deep red colors in their flowers.
* Another group has extremely small pseudobulbs and stiff, erect, solitary leaves. These cylindrical leaves act as a water reserve. They have long racemes with yellow flowers that seem to fan out at the top. Sizes of these orchids can vary from miniature plants of a couple of centimetres to giants with 30 cm-long leaves and racemes of more than one metre long. These species, known as the Mule-Ears, are now classed as &quot;Psychopsis&quot;.
* Formerly there was a third group, called the Variegata or equitant oncidiums. They have no pseudobulbs, giving fan-shaped shoots of less than 15 cm, with triangular section leaves. These oval, broad and spongy leaves act as storage organs. Their flowers are most complicated with exquisite colors. The sepals are somewhat fleshy. The petals and the lip are membranaceous. These orchids are now classified as &quot;Tolumnia&quot;. &quot;Cyrtochilum&quot; is another genus that many &quot;Oncidium&quot; species have been reclassified into; &quot;Cyrtochilum&quot; species have extremely long, winding inflorescences that can sometimes reach 20&#x27; or more, curled petals that result in three-pointed blooms, and rambling growth habits in which each new pseudobulb appears on top of the old one.

&quot;Oncidium&quot; species are characterised by the following properties :
* presence of column wings,
* presence of a complicated callus on the lip (this can be used to separate the taxa),
* pseudobulbs with one to three leaves,
* several basal bracts at the base of the pseudobulbs.

The flowers come in shades of yellow, red, white and pink. The petals are often ruffled on the edges, as is the lip. The lip is enormous, partially blocking the small petals and sepals.

Some &quot;Oncidium&quot; orchids are very tall: &quot;Oncidium altissimum&quot; and &quot;Oncidium baueri&quot; can grow to a height of 5 m.

They are known as &#x27;spray orchids&#x27; among some florists. They are very varied and are easily hybridised with other closely related genera forming the &quot;Oncidium&quot; alliance (&quot;Miltonia&quot;, &quot;Cuitlauzina&quot;, &quot;Miltoniopsis&quot;, &quot;Leochilus&quot;, &quot;Comparettia&quot;, &quot;Cyrtochilum&quot;, &quot;Tolumnia&quot;, &quot;Rhynchostele&quot; [formerly &quot;Lemboglossum&quot;], &quot;Psychopsis&quot;, etc.). Some of the best &quot;Oncidium&quot; alliance hybrids originate from &quot;Oncidium tigrinum&quot; and &quot;Oncidium incurvum&quot; when crossed with species formerly placed in &quot;Odontoglossum&quot;, although hybridization possibilities of this group of orchids are endless, and there are literally hundreds of thousands of hybrids in the &quot;Oncidium&quot; alliance.

==Nothogenera==
Many hybrids have been created artificially involving species of &quot;Oncidium&quot;, often with species of other genera. Named hybrid genera (nothogenera) are listed in the table below, together with their parent genera. , &quot;Cochlioda&quot; and &quot;Odontoglossum&quot; are included within &quot;Oncidium&quot;, and &quot;Baptistonia&quot; within &quot;Gomesa&quot;, so that nothogenus names which include these three genera are redundant.

<text>The Norwegian Football Federation (, ; NFF) is the governing body of football in Norway. It was formed in 1902 and organises the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s national teams, as well as the league systems for men and women (whose top levels are respectively the Eliteserien and Toppserien). The current president of NFF is Lise Klaveness. By 1 January 2004, there were 1,814 clubs organized in Norway and 373,532 registered players. It is the largest sports federation in Norway.

The NFF joined FIFA in 1908, and UEFA in 1954.

The NFF was part of an unsuccessful joint bid with the SvFF, the DBU and the SPL to host the UEFA Euro 2008 championship. The SvFF invited the NFF to join them in bidding for the UEFA Euro 2016 championship. The NFF and Norwegian politicians expressed support for such a proposal, but Euro 2016 was eventually awarded to France.

==Foundation==
In Spring 1902, Lyn invited representatives from Grane and Spring (both now defunct) to join together in forming a national football association. On 30 April, 14 delegates from the three clubs met at the Hotel Bristol in Oslo. These were Trygve Karlsen, Arthur Nordlie, Leif Eriksen and Bredo Eriksen from Lyn; Just Hagemann, Isak Benjaminsen, Walter Aigeltinger and Emil Wettergreen from Grane; and Christen Hummel Johansen, Arne Baggerud, Birger Freihow, Thorleif Wibe and Thorvald Torgersen from Spring. Together they agreed to form a football association, and voted 9 to 5 to adopt the name proposed by Lyn - &quot;Norsk Fodboldforbund&quot;. Isak Benjaminsen from Grane was adopted as the first chairman.

<text>Felix Arndt (May 20, 1889October 16, 1918) was an American pianist and composer of popular music. His mother was the Countess Fevrier, who was related to Napoleon III. His father, Hugo Arndt, was Swiss-born.

Educated in New York (his music teachers included Carl Lachmund), Arndt composed songs for the famous vaudeville team of Jack Norworth and Nora Bayes, and recorded over 3000 piano rolls for Duo-Art and QRS Records. He died in New York City from the &quot;Spanish flu&quot; influenza. Arndt is interred at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, Tarrytown, NY.

Arndt is best remembered for his 1915 composition &quot;Nola,&quot; written as an engagement gift to his fiancée (and later wife), Nola Locke. It is sometimes considered to be the first example of the novelty piano or &quot;novelty ragtime&quot; genre, published by Sam Fox Publishing Company. It was the signature theme of the Vincent Lopez orchestra, and a top ten hit for Les Paul in 1950. A vocal recording by Billy Williams, featuring lyrics by Sunny Skylar, became a minor hit in 1959.

<doc id="678016" wikidata="Q334851" url="?curid=678016" title="Zail Singh">
<text>Giani Zail Singh (, born Jarnail Singh; 5 May 1916 – 25 December 1994) was an Indian politician from Punjab who served as the president of India from 1982 to 1987 and chief minister of Punjab. He was the first Sikh to become president.

Born in Sandhwan in the princely state of Faridkot, Singh trained to be a granthi and was given the title of giani, meaning a learned man, while training at the Sikh Missionary School in Amritsar. Singh was associated with peasant agitations and the movement seeking a representative government in Faridkot. His political activism in the Praja Mandal, an organisation allied with the Indian National Congress, saw him sentenced to solitary confinement between 1938 and 1943. He led a flag satyagraha and formed a parallel government in Faridkot State which were called off only after the intervention of Jawaharlal Nehru and Vallabhbhai Patel. The stints in jail inspired him to change his name to Zail Singh.

After independence, Faridkot was merged with the Patiala and East Punjab States Union and Singh served as its minister of revenue and agriculture during 1949–51 and oversaw the introduction of land reforms in Punjab. Singh was a member of the Rajya Sabha during 1956–62 and member of the Punjab Legislative Assembly during 1962–67 during which time he served briefly as a minister under Partap Singh Kairon. He had served as president of PEPSU Pradesh Congress Committee during 1955–56 and became president of Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee in 1966 serving in that post until his election as chief minister of Punjab in 1972.

As chief minister, Singh is credited with having established India’s first semiconductor manufacturing unit in Mohali, legislating the Punjab Land Reforms Act of 1972, ensuring reservation for Mazhabi Sikhs and Valmikis in education and public employment and repatriating the remains of Udham Singh which were then cremated in Punjab with state honours. Singh’s policies aimed to undercut the influence of the Shiromani Akali Dal party by championing Sikh religious causes. Following the defeat of the Congress party in the elections of 1977, Singh and Sanjay Gandhi extended political and financial support to Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, a radical Sikh preacher. Bhindranwale soon became the flagbearer of Sikh separatism and an insurgency seeking the establishment of Khalistan broke out in Punjab.

Elected to the Lok Sabha in 1980, Singh was appointed India’s home minister by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. His tenure witnessed the worsening of the insurgency in Punjab where his rivalry with the state&#x27;s new chief minister and support for Bhindranwale prevented resolute action against the insurgents. In 1982, he was elected president of India, succeeding Neelam Sanjiva Reddy. The initial years of his presidency saw the Operation Blue Star, the assassination of Indira Gandhi, and the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. After Rajiv Gandhi became prime minister, relations with Singh turned frosty as Gandhi refused to meet with or inform Singh on matters of policy and placing curbs on his foreign and domestic travels. Singh hit back by questioning government policy and subjecting proposals sent to him to minute scrutiny. In 1986, he employed a pocket veto on the Indian Post Office (Amendment) Bill passed by Parliament. Allegations of corruption in the procurement of howitzers from Bofors, the government’s refusal to furnish the documents sought for by President Singh and his much-publicized reproach to the government led to speculation that Singh intended to dismiss the government of Rajiv Gandhi. Singh however retired at the end of his tenure in 1987 and was succeeded as president by R. Venkataraman.

Singh died in 1994 of injuries sustained in a road accident. His samadhi is at the Ekta Sthal in Delhi. Singh’s memoirs were published in 1997. His birth centenary was celebrated in 2016 where a documentary film and a book on his life were released.

==Early life==
Jarnail Singh was born in Sandhwan, Faridkot district on 5 May 1916 to Kishan Singh and Ind Kaur, as the youngest of their five children. He was a Ramgarhia Sikh, (Tarkhan) belonging to a caste associated with carpentry. Although his formal education ended with matriculation, Singh trained to be a granthi and studied at the Shaheed Sikh Missionary College in Amritsar where he was given the title of giani as a mark of his knowledge of the scriptures. Although his grasp of English was less than fluent, he was known for his earthy speeches in the Urdu and Punjabi languages. He married Pardhan Kaur with whom he had three daughters and a son. His nephew, Kultar Singh Sandhwan, became speaker of the Punjab Legislative Assembly in 2022.

== Praja Mandal ==
In 1936, Singh was imprisoned for a year for his participation in the Kisan Morcha. In 1938, he founded the Praja Mandal, a political organisation allied to the All India States Peoples&#x27; Conference, in Faridkot. The Mandal sought the establishment of an elected government in the princely state – a demand rejected by its ruler, Sir Harinder Singh Brar. Singh was jailed between 1938 and 1943, spending time in solitary confinement in a Faridkot prison. Upon his release in 1943, he was forced to leave Faridkot but took up the cause of the people&#x27;s movement in Faridkot outside the state. It is during his time in prison that Singh changed his name from Jarnail Singh to Zail Singh.

In 1946, he launched a satyagraha against the Faridkot government and was involved in the Flag agitation of that year for which he was imprisoned. The flag agitation ended with the Nehru-Harinder Pact by which the maharaja agreed to the formation of political associations in the state and revoked the ban on hoisting the Congress flag in Faridkot. The maharaja&#x27;s failure to fully implement the pact led to a renewed agitation in the state in 1948 when Praja Mandal activists besieged the state&#x27;s secretariat and Singh declared the formation of a parallel government in Faridkot. The agitation ended only after the intervention of Vallabhbhai Patel with the maharaja agreeing to free Singh and three other ministers of the parallel government from prison besides Praja Mandal activists arrested for their participation in the agitation. In 1948, the States Ministry of India merged Faridkot with the other Phulkian states of Punjab to form the Patiala and East Punjab States Union.

==Political career in independent India (1947–72)==
In January 1949, Singh became minister for revenue in the government of PEPSU under Chief Minister Gian Singh Rarewala. The Rarewala ministry, however, was replaced with a caretaker government within ten months of its formation owing to political dissension. In 1951, Col. Raghbir Singh became the chief minister and Zail Singh was appointed minister for agriculture. His actions as minister include the repeal of the Criminal Tribes Act, the promulgation of the Political Sufferers ordinance and changes introduced to land laws that abolished the right of the Raja of Faridkot to seize lands of the peasants and removing the privileges enjoyed by landlords under existing land laws. He piloted the Biswedar Abolition Ordinance that provided for the appropriation without compensation of land owned by the landlords and tenancy rights to the cultivators. In the elections of 1952, Singh lost from the Kotkapura Jaito constituency. He became president of PEPSU Pradesh Congress Committee during 1955–56 when it was merged with Punjab.

During 1956 to 1962, he served as Member of Parliament in the Rajya Sabha. He resigned his membership in March 1962 to contest the Punjab Legislative Assembly elections and won from the Faridkot constituency. He briefly served as a minister in the Partap Singh Kairon ministry but resigned in the wake of the 1962 war with China and the reduction in size of the ministry. In 1966, he became president of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee, a post he held until his appointment as chief minister in 1972. Although he did not contest the election of 1967, he was re-elected to the Punjab Assembly from Anandpur Sahib through a by-election in 1970.

==Chief Minister of Punjab (1972–77)==
In the 1972 elections to the Punjab Legislative Assembly, Singh was elected from Anandpur Sahib constituency. The Congress party won a majority and formed the government with Singh as chief minister. He and a ten member ministry were sworn in on 17 March 1972. Singh was the first Other Backward Class leader and the only non-Jat Sikh to be elected chief minister of Punjab since its reorganisation in 1966 until 2021 when Charanjit Singh Channi, a Dalit Sikh, became chief minister.

From the outset Singh projected himself as a champion of the Sikh religion, in part, because he did not belong to the dominant Jat caste and also to counter the Akali Dal party. As part of this policy, he inaugurated the Guru Gobind Singh Marg – a highway linking Punjab’s most prominent gurudwaras, renamed several government hospitals after Sikh gurus, started the Guru Nanak Dev University in Amritsar and renamed a town near Chandigarh after one of Guru Gobind Singh’s sons. In response to their electoral setbacks, Akali Dal politicians gathered at Anandpur Sahib in October 1972 and passed a resolution demanding greater autonomy to Punjab and self-determination for the Sikhs.

Singh’s government enacted the Punjab Land Reforms Act, 1972, which fixed land ceilings at per family. Several key provisions of the Act were struck down the following year by the Punjab and Haryana High Court prompting a further appeal by the state government in India&#x27;s Supreme Court. The Act, which also provided for redistribution of surplus land, failed in its implementation and consequently there was little change in land ownership.

Singh introduced a scheme for life-long pension for participants in India’s independence movement. In 1974, he repatriated the remains of Udham Singh from the United Kingdom which were then taken in a procession to Punjab, cleverly utilising the media attention and popular interest in it to burnish his credentials. The remains were cremated in Sunam with full state honours and Singh himself lit the funeral pyre. He also took to honouring the legacy of Bhagat Singh, declaring a gazetted holiday on his birthday, converting his ancestral home at Khatkar Kalan into a museum and honouring his mother with the title of ‘Punjab Mata’.

He was also responsible for getting the Department of Electronics to establish the Semiconductor Complex Limited at Mohali in 1974 overriding their preferred choice of Madras (now Chennai). This was India’s first semiconductor fabricating unit. It became operational in 1983 and manufactured integrated chips using American know-how. In 1975, Singh introduced a reservation of fifty per cent of jobs for Valmikis and Mazhabi Sikhs under the quota of jobs reserved for the scheduled castes. The move aimed to consolidate the dalit vote behind the Congress party and enhanced his own standing amongst them.

Following the imposition of the Emergency of 1975, Singh zealously implemented the policies of Sanjay Gandhi’s five point program. The national population policy with its focus on compulsory sterilisation was implemented often through coercive steps of the police and administration. Singh was forced to implement the policy, in part, to retain favour with Sanjay Gandhi, whom he had once described as his saviour, and to stave off the challenge to his leadership from other Congress leaders of Punjab, notably Mohinder Singh Gill who was the party’s president.

In the general elections of 1977 that followed the Emergency, the Congress party for the first time failed to win even a single seat from Punjab. Singh’s tenure as chief minister ended on 30 April 1977 when Punjab was placed under President&#x27;s rule. In the elections to the state Assembly held in June 1977, the Shiromani Akali Dal was elected to office winning 58 out of 104 seats in the Legislative Assembly.

The defeat of the Congress party in the elections of 1977 led Sanjay Gandhi and Singh to look for a Sikh leader who would weaken the Akali Dal by espousing a strident stand on matters of Sikh faith thus undercutting the Akalis. The tactic was inspired partly by Partap Singh Kairon who, as chief minister, had propped up Fateh Singh as a counter to the Akali leader Tara Singh during the 1960s. Their choice was Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale who was then a little known Sikh preacher but would go on to be a Frankenstein&#x27;s monster for his patrons. Bhindranwale came to limelight in 1978 when a clash between his followers and Nirankari Sikhs led to the death of a dozen people. The Congress party lionised Bhindranwale and helped him establish the Dal Khalsa party. In the general elections of 1980, Bhindranwale even campaigned for Congress candidates.

==Union Minister of Home Affairs (1980–82)==
In the general election of 1980, which the Congress party under Indira Gandhi won; Singh was elected to Parliament from Hoshiarpur. He was inducted into the government as Minister of Home Affairs on 14 January 1980 continuing in that post till 22 June 1982. The Punjab government under Parkash Singh Badal was dismissed and the state brought under President’s rule in February 1980. In the elections held in June, the Congress party won a majority in the Assembly and Darbara Singh, a political rival of Zail Singh, was appointed chief minister. The out of power Akali Dal now revived the demands in the Anandpur Sahib resolution and allied with pro-Khalistan forces abroad.

The factionalism in the Congress and the political feuding between Zail Singh and Darbara Singh further complicated the situation in Punjab and prevented resolute administrative action against the insurgents. Bhindranwale was able to use the discord between the central and state governments to his advantage. He was suspected of involvement in the murders of the Nirankari guru Gurbachan Singh in April 1980 and of the newspaper magnate Lala Jagat Narain in September 1981. Even though arrest warrants were issued against him, who was then in the state of Haryana, Bhindranwale was able to escape to his gurudwara in the Punjab in an official car provided to him by the Haryana Chief Minister Bhajan Lal on the instructions of Singh. Bhindranwale gave himself up for arrest later that month but was released from jail in October following widespread unrest in the Punjab and after Singh declared in Parliament that Bhindranwale was not involved in Narain’s murder. In each of these instances even as Darbara Singh wanted to crack down on Bhindranwale, Zail Singh intervened on his behalf in the hope of using him as a pawn in his political battle against Darbara Singh.

Bhindranwale&#x27;s release served to demoralise the Punjab Police as they now became targets for Sikh extremists and furthered emboldened Bhindranwale. Similarly, requests to ban the Dal Khalsa by the state government were stonewalled by the Union Home Ministry before the prime minister intervened to have the ban imposed. Singh’s tenure as India’s home minister has generally been viewed unfavourably. He was seen as a weak and inept minister who was appointed to prevent him from developing strong base in Punjab and as someone who mishandled crises in the Punjab, Kashmir and the North East.

== President of India (1982–87) ==

In June 1982, Singh was chosen by the Congress party to be its candidate for the presidential election to succeed Neelam Sanjiva Reddy, rejecting a proposal by the opposition to have a consensus candidate. A group of ten opposition parties decided to field the Communist politician Hiren Mukherjee as their candidate. Singh’s nomination was seen as a gesture to the Sikhs at a time when the separatist agitation for Khalistan was gaining popularity. However, it was also aimed at keeping Singh out of active politics allowing Singh’s bête noire Darbara Singh to run the Punjab government without interference from the Centre. Singh’s loyalty to the prime minister was another reason for his nomination as the Congress party was unsure of its prospects in the general elections scheduled for 1985.

The opposition’s original candidate was dropped as Mukherjee was not a registered voter, which is a prerequisite for any person contesting a presidential election. Hans Raj Khanna, a former judge of the Supreme Court of India who had defended fundamental rights and championed the inviolability of the basic structure of the constitution during the Emergency and was subsequently overlooked for appointment as Chief Justice, became the opposition candidate.

The election was held on 12 July 1982 with the electoral college comprising 756 members of Parliament and 3827 members of legislative assemblies. When the votes were counted on 15 July, Singh emerged the winner with 754,113 votes, or 72.7 per cent, against Khanna’s 282,685 votes and was declared elected the same day by the returning officer. Singh won a majority in each of India’s state assemblies except for West Bengal and Tripura. He was sworn in the seventh president of India on 25 July 1982. He was the first Sikh as also the first person from a backward caste to become president.

=== Indira Gandhi ministry (1982–84) ===

Singh was known for his loyalty to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and had remarked that he would pick up a broom and become a sweeper if she were to ask him to do so. It was reported that Singh would walk down to the South Court of Rashtrapati Bhavan to receive her when she called on him, even opening her car door in breach of all protocol. In 1983, New Delhi hosted both the seventh summit of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip arrived on a state visit in November 1983, as the guests of President Singh and stayed at the Rashtrapati Bhavan.

As president, he spoke out against the Akali Dal’s assertion that Sikhs were being discriminated against in India, challenged the rule of jathedars and the role of religious leaders in the separatist movement in Punjab, and criticised the use of Sikh shrines as sanctuaries by criminals. In June 1984, the Indian Army launched Operation Blue Star to neutralise Sikh militants based in the Golden Temple complex in Amritsar. Singh was not appraised of these plans neither when Punjab was brought under President’s rule nor when Prime Minister Gandhi met him for a routine briefing the day before the operation was launched. When Singh visited the Golden Temple complex on 8 June, he was shot at by a sniper. Although he was not hit, his security officer was seriously injured. Singh was deeply upset at the damage done to the temple complex. Singh later justified the military operation saying bloodshed could have been avoided had militants surrendered and urging all Sikhs to ensure that their temples would not in the future be used to house arms and material not sanctioned by Sikh tradition. In September, the Akal Takht, the highest temporal body in Sikhism, condemned Singh for his alleged role in the military operation and held him guilty of religious misconduct. He was exonerated 24 days later by the Sikh high priests after he expressed contrition and sought forgiveness before the Akal Takht for the ‘unfortunate incidents’ that had happened there.
In August 1984, Rashtrapati Bhavan became the venue of an unusual political gathering when N. T. Rama Rao, who had been dismissed as chief minister of Andhra Pradesh by the governor, met Singh with over 160 members of the Legislative Assembly. The Governor Thakur Ram Lal had appointed N. Bhaskara Rao as the new chief minister and provided him a month’s time to prove his majority in the assembly despite the ousted chief minister’s claim of being able to prove his own majority in two days’ time and evidence that he was supported by a majority of legislators. Following widespread protests, the governor was recalled and Rama Rao returned as chief minister following a vote of confidence. The Singh presidency saw similar dismissal of state governments and imposition of President’s rule in Jammu and Kashmir and in Sikkim.

Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated on 31 October 1984 by her Sikh bodyguards. Her son Rajiv Gandhi and Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee were in West Bengal campaigning for upcoming Assembly elections while Singh was on a state visit to North Yemen. He returned to Delhi the same evening and visited the All India Institute of Medical Sciences where Indira Gandhi had been admitted. The presidential cavalcade was pelted with stones en route and violence against Sikhs began in Delhi. After the deaths of prime ministers Nehru in 1964 and Shastri in 1966, the president had appointed the senior most Cabinet minister, Gulzarilal Nanda, as the acting prime minister while the Congress Parliamentary Party went about electing a new leader who would then become prime minister. That convention would have required Singh to appoint Pranab Mukherjee as the acting prime minister. However, the Congress Parliamentary Board, the executive committee of the parliamentary party, nominated Rajiv Gandhi for appointment as prime minister. Accordingly, Singh swore Rajiv Gandhi in as prime minister the same evening (31 October). The choice of Rajiv Gandhi was unanimously approved by the Congress Parliamentary Party three days later.

=== Rajiv Gandhi ministry (1984–87) ===

Indira Gandhi’s assassination was followed by anti-Sikh rioting across India which lasted for four days till 3 November 1984. Although constitutionally the supreme commander of the Indian Armed Forces, Singh was unable to act to stop the violence. Tarlochan Singh, President Singh’s press secretary, later alleged that although the president had tried to talk to the prime minister regarding the rioting in Delhi, Rajiv Gandhi never got back to him whereas Home Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao told him that the government was busy arranging Indira Gandhi’s funeral. Singh later admitted that his commitment to the Congress party and to the Indian Constitution were severely tested by these events but he chose to remain in his post. Rajiv Gandhi soon called for parliamentary elections which were held between 24 and 28 December 1984. The Congress party won 404 out of the 514 seats, the highest number ever won by a party in India’s general elections. A forty member council of ministers with Gandhi as the prime minister were sworn in on 31 December 1984.

The relationship between President Singh and Prime Minister Gandhi quickly turned sour. Gandhi viewed Singh as a rustic parvenu whose actions were partly responsible for the imbroglio in the Punjab that had led to his mother’s assassination. As prime minister, Gandhi called on Singh only once before the elections and dispensed with the practice of calling on the president to discuss matters of state entirely. Following his cue, union ministers too stopped calling on Singh, a situation that lasted for almost two years before Gandhi gave-in and called on Singh in March 1987. Gandhi stopped briefing Singh about matters of domestic and foreign policy and refused to sanction official visits abroad for Singh and Congress governments in the states began to put off visits by the president. Singh retaliated by subjecting all proposals sent to him to minute scrutiny, seeking explanations from the government on not formulating a policy on judicial appointments, questioning its television coverage policy and cautioning the governor of Andhra Pradesh, Kumudben Joshi, to desist from interfering in the state’s politics besides seeking an explanation from the Chief Election Commissioner of India about the delay in holding scheduled elections in the state of Haryana. These interventions caused the government considerable embarrassment.
Singh is also remembered for his stance on the Indian Post Office (Amendment) Bill, 1986. The bill, passed by both houses of Parliament, empowered central and state governments to intercept, inspect and detain any items in the post perceived to be a threat to national security. In effect, the bill gave the government unbridled powers to surveil postal communication and violated citizens’ rights. Singh, instead of returning the bill to Parliament for its reconsideration, decided to withhold his assent to it. If the bill were to be sent back to Parliament, in which the Congress party held an overwhelming majority, it could have reiterated its support for the bill which would have forced Singh to give it his assent. As the Constitution places no time limit within which presidential assent is to be given to legislation sent to him, Singh decided to keep it in abeyance – thus effecting a pocket veto. The bill remained unsigned even by his successor who returned it to the Rajya Sabha for its reconsideration.

During 1986–87, as allegations of corruption began to surface in the procurement of Bofors howitzers by the Indian government; Singh sought information regarding the matter from the government. Gandhi took the stance that the president did not have the right to know every classified matter made available to the prime minister or the Council of Ministers and the Cabinet passed a resolution rejecting Singh’s demand. In Parliament, however, Gandhi stated that the &quot;president was being fully informed&quot;, a patently false statement. Singh responded by writing to the prime minister narrating specific instances where no information had been furnished despite repeated demands. A copy of the letter was leaked to the press. This allegation by the head of state against the head of government served to further reduce the government’s credibility.

By 1987, it was widely speculated that Singh intended to dismiss the Rajiv Gandhi ministry and appoint in its place a caretaker ministry under either R. Venkataraman or P. V. Narasimha Rao. As Singh’s tenure was drawing to a close, it was thought that such a move would lead to a second term in office for him with support from the opposition and members of the Congress party opposed to Gandhi. Gandhi, who had strained relations with the Chief of the Army Staff General Sundarji and his Defence Minister Arun Singh, was opposed to giving Singh a further term in office. Singh, however, never acted on the plan and decided not to seek a second term as he failed to get the open support of the opposition and feared it could lead to an army takeover.

=== State visits ===
Singh led state visits to Bahrain, Czechoslovakia, and Qatar in 1983; to Argentina, Mauritius, Mexico, North and South Yemen in 1984. Singh was in Aden, Yemen when Indira Gandhi was assassinated. He also made visits to Greece, Nepal, Poland, and Yugoslavia 1986. As the relationship between Rajiv Gandhi and Singh soured, the government began sending Vice-President R. Venkataraman on trips abroad in place of Singh. Even visits to nations which were customarily made by the head of state began to be made by the vice-president or the prime minister and some, such as a visit to Zimbabwe, which had been finalised were cancelled. Consequently, Singh became one of the least travelled presidents of India.

==Later life and death==
Singh was succeeded to the presidency by Ramaswamy Venkataraman, who was sworn in on 25 July 1987. Singh chose to spend his retirement in Delhi where the government provided him with a bungalow on Circular Road.

Singh was severely injured in a road accident when his car collided with a truck at Kiratpur Sahib in the Ropar district of Punjab on 29 November 1994. He was admitted to the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research in Chandigarh where he died on 25 December 1994, aged 78. The Government of India declared 7 days of national mourning. His cremation was held on 26 December in Delhi where his samadhi is located at Ekta Sthal.

Singh&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;The Memoirs of Giani Zail Singh&quot;, was published in 1996.

== Commemoration ==

A commemorative postage stamp was issued by India&#x27;s Department of Posts on the occasion of Singh&#x27;s first death anniversary in 1995. The Giani Zail Singh Campus College of Engineering and Technology, Bhatinda is named after him. The birth centenary of Singh was celebrated in 2016 at which a documentary film on his life and a book were released in his honour.

<text>Alfred Earl &quot;Al&quot; Hansen (5 October 1927 – 20 June 1995) was an American artist. He was a member of Fluxus, a movement that originated on an artists&#x27; collective around George Maciunas.

He was the father of Andy Warhol protégé Bibbe Hansen and the grandfather and artistic mentor of rock musician Beck and artist Channing Hansen. Bibbe and Channing continue his legacy by performing some of his most iconic works.

== Biography ==
Hansen was born in 1927 in New York City, to a family of Norwegian heritage. He was a friend to several notable artists, including Yoko Ono and John Cage. Hansen served in Germany during World War II. During his service, Hansen once pushed a piano off the roof of a five-story building, which became the foundation of one of his most recognized performance pieces, the &quot;Yoko Ono Piano Drop.&quot; Many artists have also destroyed or altered pianos including John Cage, Joseph Beuys, Nam June Paik and Raphael Montañez Ortiz.

Hansen studied with composer John Cage at the now famous 1958 Composition Class at the New School for Social Research in New York City along with fellow students, Dick Higgins, George Brecht, and Allan Kaprow amongst others. Hansen was perhaps best known for his performance pieces, his participation in Happenings, and for his collages in which he often used cigarette butts and candy bar wrappers as the raw materials, among them numerous variations of a sculpture referring to the Venus of Willendorf.

He wrote an important book about performance art, &quot;A Primer of Happenings and Time Space Art&quot; published by Something Else Press in 1965.

In 1966 he attended the Destruction in Art Symposium in London organized by Gustav Metzger, where he met and befriended many of the Viennese Action Artists. In October 1966 Otto Muhl organized an event called &quot;Action Concert for Al Hansen&quot; in Vienna.

Hansen was a frequent visitor to &quot;The Factory&quot;, Andy Warhol&#x27;s studio in New York. In 1969, Hansen founded the underground magazine &quot;Kiss&quot;, which featured a gossip column by Warhol and contributions by his Factory superstars.

He was an art professor at Rutgers College in Newark, New Jersey, into the 1970s.

In 1977 Hansen managed Los Angeles punk bands the Controllers and the Screamers in Hollywood. In the 1980s Hansen moved to Cologne, Germany, where he and colleague Lisa Cieslik established an art school, the &quot;Ultimate Akademie&quot;. Inspired among others by the &quot;Final Academy&quot; of Genesis P-Orridge it became a meeting point for local and international performers of the time-based arts.

He died in Cologne, Germany, in 1995, with a number of friends celebrating a Fluxus funeral according to his plan.

<doc id="678022" wikidata="Q1965191" url="?curid=678022" title="Snark (Lewis Carroll)">
<text>The snark is a fictional animal species created by Lewis Carroll. &quot;Snark&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;snake&quot; and &quot;shark&quot;. This creature appears in Carroll&#x27;s nonsense poem &quot;The Hunting of the Snark.&quot; His descriptions of the creatures were, in his own words, unimaginable, and he wanted that to remain so.

==The origin of the poem==

According to Carroll, the initial inspiration to write the poem – which he called an &quot;agony in eight fits&quot; – was the final line, &quot;For the snark was a boojum, you see&quot;.

Carroll was asked repeatedly to explain the snark. In all cases, his answer was he did not know and could not explain. Later commentators have offered many analyses of the work. One such likens the contemporary Commissioners in Lunacy individually to the ten hunters, noting that Carroll&#x27;s favourite uncle, Skeffington Lutwidge, himself a member of the commission had, like the poem&#x27;s Baker, met his end in a &quot;chasm&quot;—Lutwidge was murdered by an asylum inmate called McKave.

==Descriptions of the snark==

The poem describes several varieties of snark. Some have feathers and bite, and some have whiskers and scratch. The &quot;boojum&quot; is a particular variety of snark, which causes the baker at the end of the poem to &quot;softly and suddenly vanish away, and never be met with again&quot;.

The Bellman in the poem describes &quot;five unmistakable marks&quot; that identify a snark. One, the snark&#x27;s flavour; &quot;meager and hollow, but crisp&quot; (apparently like a coat too tight in the waist). Two, it sleeps late into the day, waking near five in the afternoon. Three, it dislikes jokes, especially puns. Four, it likes bathing-machines, and carries them with it wherever it goes. Fifth and last, it is ambitious. The Baker relays his uncle&#x27;s narration, which says that a snark prepared as a meal is served with greens, and is &quot;handy for striking a light&quot;; the Annotated Snark suggests that this could mean either that its skin is useful for striking matches on, or that it breathes fire.

The domain of the snark is an island filled with chasms and crags, very distant from England. On the same island may also be found other creatures such as the jubjub and bandersnatch. The snark is a peculiar creature that cannot be captured in a commonplace way. Above all, courage is required during a snark hunt. The most common method is to seek it with thimbles, care, forks, and hope. One may also &quot;threaten its life with a railway share&quot; or &quot;charm it with smiles and soap&quot;.
