<text>Gary Robert Ablett (born 1 October 1961) is a former professional Australian rules footballer who represented and in the Australian Football League (AFL). Nicknamed &quot;God&quot;, Ablett is widely regarded as one of Australian football&#x27;s greatest players, and was especially renowned for his high-flying spectacular marks and his prolific goalkicking.

After playing for several country teams in and around his hometown of Drouin, Victoria, Ablett was recruited by Hawthorn and made his Victorian Football League (VFL) debut in 1982. However, he struggled to adjust to city life and retreated to Myrtleford the following year. The Geelong Football Club managed to lure him back to professional football in 1984, and by the late &#x27;80s, he had become one of the VFL&#x27;s biggest stars. His 1989 VFL Grand Final appearance, during which he kicked a grand final record nine goals for a losing side (and tying the outright grand final record with Gordon Coventry), is regarded as one of football&#x27;s greatest individual performances, earning him the Norm Smith Medal. At the beginning of the 1991 season, Ablett shocked the football world by abruptly announcing his retirement from the game, but he made a comeback midway through the year. He went on to appear in the 1992, 1994, and 1995 grand finals, before officially retiring on September 25, 1997.

Ablett&#x27;s individual accolades and achievements include an induction into the Australian Football Hall of Fame, an AFL Team of the Century selection, the 1993 AFL Players Association MVP award (now known as the Leigh Matthews Trophy), and three Coleman Medals. He remains Geelong&#x27;s all-time leading goalkicker, with 1021 goals; and, in 2006, was voted by past and present Geelong Football Club players as the greatest Geelong footballer of all time.

==Early life==

Born in Drouin to Alfred and Colleen Ablett, Gary Ablett grew up in Gippsland, Victoria, alongside his four elder brothers and three sisters. Ablett displayed a love for sport at an early age, winning the state school high jump at 10 years of age. He was also awarded both club and competition best-and-fairest awards for Drouin at the under-11s, under-12s and under-14s levels.

After his interest waned in attending school, Ablett dropped out of high school at 15 to become a bricklayer. He also began to concentrate on his football and joined his brothers in the Drouin senior team at just 16 years of age. After appearing in several country league representative games, the Hawthorn Football Club, which had already signed Gary&#x27;s elder brothers Geoff and Kevin onto their lists, invited him to play reserves football.

==Career==

===AFL===

====The Hawthorn experience (1981–1983)====
After signing a reserves contract and featuring in six reserves games for Hawthorn, Ablett retreated back to his home in Drouin. He returned to Hawthorn in 1982 and made his senior VFL debut versus Geelong in Round 2, kicking 1 goal and helping the Hawks defeat the Cats by 19 points. He played a further five games for Hawthorn that year for a total of six games and ten goals. Ablett claimed difficulty coping with city life in Melbourne and his continual absenteeism from training sessions forced Hawthorn coach, Allan Jeans into parting ways with the talented, but wayward young half forward.

In 1983, he moved with his young family to the country town of Myrtleford. Ablett spent the year playing under the tutelage of his cousin Len Ablett for Myrtleford in the Ovens and Murray Football League. Ablett&#x27;s footballing ability soon came on notice again, this time to the Geelong Football Club and their long-time recruiting officer Bill McMaster. McMaster convinced Ablett to give the game another shot, this time in the confines of the rural city of Geelong. After protracted negotiations with Hawthorn, Geelong finally paid a $60,000 transfer for Ablett in 1984.

====The early years at Geelong (1984–1988)====
Ablett signed a one-year contract for the 1984 season with Geelong, and he began his first season under the guidance of Tom Hafey. He debuted for the Cats in Round 1 and after just nine games on the wing, Ablett was selected to his first State of Origin game for Victoria. Ablett earned best-on-ground honours after kicking 8 goals from the half-forward flank. He played 15 games and kicked 33 goals in the 1984 season, and was awarded the Carji Greeves Medal as the Geelong Football Club&#x27;s &quot;best and fairest&quot; player of the year. Following his first season with Geelong, Ablett signed a new three-year contract with the club.

Playing mostly on the half forward flank, Ablett won the club&#x27;s goalkicking award for the following two seasons with 82 and 65 goals respectively. Although Ablett had developed a reputation for his laconic, lazy attitude to training under coach John Devine, this did not prevent him from earning top three placings in the best and fairest awards from 1985 to 1987.

With his contract expiring at the conclusion of the 1987 season, Ablett shocked the VFL by signing a new five-year contract with his former club, Hawthorn. After a &quot;cooling-off&quot; period, however, Ablett opted to remain with Geelong by agreeing to a lucrative five-year contract that tied him to the club for the long-term.

Ablett began the 1988 season with 59 goals after just 11 games, placing him second on the goalkicking list behind Hawthorn&#x27;s Jason Dunstall. In these games, he kicked 10 goals against Richmond in the Anzac Day game, and 11 against Brisbane—one shy of breaking the ground record of 12 goals at Carrara. Although he missed out on State honours and failed to place within the top three in the club best and fairest award, Ablett finished with 82 goals during the season for the second time in his career.

====A September to remember (1989–1990)====
The 1989 season was marked by the arrival of Ablett&#x27;s third coach, former North Melbourne Brownlow Medallist Malcolm Blight. Ablett helped the Cats reach the finals on the back of a ten match winning streak to end the regular season. In a 134-point victory against Richmond, Ablett scored 14 goals, breaking a 22-year club record, and moving club legend and former club premiership coach Bobby Davis to laud Ablett as the equal of the legendary Graham &#x27;Polly&#x27; Farmer, the finest footballers he had seen at Geelong. His season lowlight occurred in Round 12 when he was suspended for 3 matches after he controversially felled the Melbourne captain, Gary Lyon behind the play.

In his first ever final, the Qualifying Final at the MCG versus Essendon, Gary Ablett kicked three goals, but this was not enough. The Bombers humbled Geelong by 76 points to force the Cats into a sudden-death Semi Final showdown with Melbourne. The Cats posted a 63-point win against the Demons. Ablett kicked seven goals, and helped set up another meeting with Essendon in the Preliminary Final. Ablett kicked 8 goals this time, as the Cats crushed Essendon by 94 points to advance to their first grand final since 1967.

Against the reigning premiers Hawthorn in the 1989 VFL Grand Final, Ablett asserted himself from the opening bounce, leading out from full forward, marking the first centre clearance kick and slotting through the game&#x27;s first goal. By half-time, Ablett had kicked four goals, but the Cats trailed at the main break by 37 points. Ablett kicked a further five goals in the second half, which saw an injury-depleted Hawthorn&#x27;s lead reduced to just 6 points with less than a minute to go. However, the Cats fell short, and Hawthorn held on to defeat Geelong in one of the toughest grand finals of the modern era, winning by 6 points. Ablett&#x27;s performance in kicking 9 goals earned him the Norm Smith Medal, and in doing so became only the second member of the losing team in VFL/AFL history to be awarded the honour – a performance regarded by many as unrivalled on football&#x27;s biggest stage. Ablett&#x27;s 9 goals also saw him equal Gordon Coventry&#x27;s goals record set in the 1928 Grand Final.

====Shock retirement and return (1991–1992)====

On 1 February 1991, Ablett, aged 29, stunned most football fans when he announced his retirement, citing personal reasons and a loss of enjoyment for the game. His previous season in 1990 was marred by injury, dipping motivation, and personal issues, including a separation from his wife. He was eventually encouraged to reverse his decision and he made his return in Round 12 for the Geelong reserves team. This generated enormous media interest and drew an abnormally large crowd for the curtain-raiser game at Princes Park. 
Ablett was named in the senior side for the following game against , which drew a crowd of over 40,000 to the MCG. He had ten possessions and kicked two goals, one of them an important steadier for the Cats in the last quarter after the Demons had closed to within 24 points. Due to his late season start and lack of conditioning, it was probably no surprise that Ablett failed to recapture his best form, ending his season on a sour note when he was suspended for striking St Kilda rover Nathan Burke in the first week of the finals, and he subsequently missed Geelong&#x27;s finals defeats to Hawthorn and West Coast.

Ablett put the disappointment of 1991 behind him, and he dedicated himself to improving his fitness base ahead of the 1992 season. A consistent first half of the year helped the Cats achieve an 11–3 record, eventually earning them a spot in the grand final—this time against the West Coast Eagles. After establishing a two-goal lead at half-time, the Cats failed to sustain their momentum during the second half, eventually going down by 28 points to the fast-finishing Eagles. Ablett, who finished with 3 goals, had again failed to finish the year with the same good form in which he had begun it.

====One special season (1993)====

Before the 1993 season, Ablett was encouraged by his coach, Malcolm Blight, to move from his customary roaming half-forward position to full-forward, in an effort to prolong his career. The move up forward proved to be a master-stroke, with Ablett thriving in his goal-kicking role, reaching the 50-goal mark in just six games, equalling the sixty-year record of South Melbourne legend Bob Pratt. He brought up his maiden century of goals in the season just eight games later, one game slower than record-holder Pratt, and became the first Geelong player to kick 100 goals in a season since Larry Donohue in 1976. Although the Cats did not make the Finals, Ablett&#x27;s new-found dominance up forward was highlighted during the season with his bags of ten or more goals on five occasions, including a 14-goal performance against Essendon in Round 6. His end-of-season total of 124 goals, achieved in just 17 appearances, earned him his first Coleman Medal as the League&#x27;s leading goal-scorer, the Leigh Matthews Trophy, the AFMA Player of the Year Award, and a top-ten placing in the Brownlow Medal.

====1993 to 1996====

Ablett continued his dominance as a full-forward in 1994 and 1995 by winning the Coleman Medal in each year. Ablett is the only player in VFL/AFL history to kick 100 goals and win the Coleman Medal in three successive seasons. In addition to his explosive pace and skills, Ablett was also an accomplished aerialist with strong hands. A highlight was the 1994 Mark of the Year over Collingwood&#x27;s Gary Pert on Mother&#x27;s Day at the MCG, a mark which is captured in Jamie Cooper&#x27;s painting &quot;the Game That Made Australia&quot;, commissioned by the AFL in 2008 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the sport. There is still debate over whether he had enough control of the ball to be paid a mark.

In early 1996, Ablett was suspended for five games for striking St Kilda&#x27;s 172 cm Kristian Bardsley with a raised forearm. He later remarked that his lengthy suspension was the &quot;beginning of the end&quot;, and he finished out the season with 69 goals in 17 games. His last AFL appearance was against North Melbourne in a Qualifying Final in 1996. Ablett managed to kick only one goal in a disappointing 60-point loss. In October 1996, he missed Geelong&#x27;s first training session and was fined $10,000.

On 22 November 1996, Ablett was admitted to hospital with a severe bout of gastro. On 28 November, Ablett faced traffic charges.

====1997, end of career====
Ablett was ready to start the serious training with the club by the first week of January. By February, it was reported that he was still under pressure to improve his fitness. In March, Geelong confirmed that Ablett would play in 1997. On Sunday, 31 March 1997, Ablett played in the reserves against Richmond. Gary booted 7 goals but injured his knee. Three days later, on 3 April, he underwent arthroscopic surgery. In early June, Ablett had still not recovered; he faced knee surgery. During the preliminary finals in September, he announced his retirement from football.

===State of Origin===
Ablett had a prolific State of Origin career, kicking 43 goals in 11 games. He was first selected to play for Victoria in 1984, against Western Australia, only nine games into his career at Geelong, kicking 8 goals in a best-on-ground performance.

He performed well again the following year, kicking 4 goals against South Australia. In the following few years Ablett was largely out of the side, apart from 1987, when he kicked 2 goals against South Australia. Ablett again performed at the highest level in 1990, kicking 6 goals, against Western Australia in Perth. After returning from retirement midway through 1991, and after only several games, Ablett was controversially selected for Victoria, kicking 2 goals. In 1992 Ablett performed well, kicking 3 goals and being named among the best players, against Western Australia.

In 1993, he kicked 4 goals, against a combined New South Wales–Australian Capital Territory side, and in the same year Ablett again performed on the big stage, kicking 5 goals in the State of Origin Carnival Grand Final. In 1994, he kicked 4 goals, against South Australia, in what has been regarded as &quot;one of the greatest Australian football games of all time&quot; and followed up that performance with 4 goals against South Australia in 1995. On representing Victoria, Ablett has said &quot;I&#x27;ve always found it a tremendous honour to represent your state, in a State of Origin game&quot;.

==Legacy==
Ablett combined strength, speed, and skill to produce many spectacular highlights and goal-kicking feats. A noted big game player, Ablett kicked 43 goals in 11 State appearances. Also significantly, he booted 64 goals over the course of his 16 finals – an average of four goals a game. His individual haul of 27 goals in the 1989 finals series from four games is a VFL/AFL record that still stands. He was awarded the Norm Smith Medal for his performance in the 1989 Grand Final, where he was adjudged best player afield. In doing so, he became one of only four players to win the medal playing for the losing side (the others being Maurice Rioli in 1982, Nathan Buckley in 2002, and Chris Judd in 2005). In 1996, Ablett joined Gordon Coventry, Doug Wade, Jason Dunstall, and Tony Lockett as the only players in league history to kick 1000 VFL/AFL goals. Lance Franklin would join this exclusive club in 2022.

Martin Flanagan&#x27;s representation of Australian football pioneer Tom Wills in his 1996 novel &quot;The Call&quot; is modeled on Ablett. According to Flanagan, Wills and Ablett polarised opinion in similar ways, and displayed a lack of insight into their actions—they simply did what came naturally to them, &quot;like a lot of artists&quot;. Ablett is the subject of the song &quot;Kicking the Footy with God&quot;, released by The Bedroom Philosopher on his 2005 debut album &quot;In Bed with My Doona&quot;.

In 1996, Ablett was named in the AFL Team of the Century on the interchange bench, alongside Jack Dyer and Greg Williams. In 2001, Ablett was named in the Geelong Team of the Century, on a half-forward flank. In 2005, after many years of controversy and debate (see below), he was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame. The following year, he was honoured yet again when he was voted as the Greatest Geelong player of all-time ahead of Graham Farmer.

In 2006, Ablett was honoured with the naming of a terrace in his name within the newly renovated Skilled Stadium. Ablett once had a set of gates named in his honour, but he was upgraded to a terrace at the beginning of the 2006 AFL season.

===Induction into the Australian Football Hall of Fame===
Despite his footballing achievements on the field, Ablett&#x27;s induction into the Australian Football Hall of Fame was initially delayed. Despite Ablett&#x27;s undoubted footballing credentials, his well-publicised contribution to the death of Alisha Horan was responsible for the Australian Football Hall of Fame committee&#x27;s reluctance to induct him. In 2004, after several years of speculation over his induction, Ablett personally requested that the Geelong Football Club stop nominating him for selection, which the club agreed to. However, the following year it was announced that Ablett would be inducted into the Hall of Fame as part of the 2005 intake.

Ablett did not attend the induction ceremony and instead released a statement through his then-manager, Michael Baker:
&quot;Due to my current battle with depression I am not in a position to be able to accept this award in person. I did not make this decision lightly but due to medical advice it was deemed best for my health that I do not attend tonight. I feel blessed to have had the opportunity to play this great game and also to have played at the elite level alongside many celebrated champions. Being chosen to be inducted into the Hall of Fame is one of the highest honours a player could dream of. I thank those who deem me worthy enough to be placed alongside such respected company.&quot;

==Personal life==
The youngest of eight children, Ablett grew up alongside four elder brothers and three elder sisters. In 1985, Ablett wed his long-time girlfriend Sue, and the couple had four children – Natasha, Gary Jr., Nathan, and Alisha.

In 1986, Ablett became a born-again Christian and has been said to be slightly aggrieved at constantly being referred to as &quot;God&quot; by fans, a nickname based on his supreme football abilities. Ablett&#x27;s faith was often highlighted in several tribunal appearances, in one case confessing and pleading guilty to striking Garry Lyon in a 1989 incident, declaring he &quot;wasn&#x27;t prepared to lie about it or compromise the truth in [his] relationship with God&quot;. Ablett&#x27;s public acknowledgement of his faith, in particular the influence of God in his life, during his acceptance speech for the Norm Smith Medal in the 1989 Grand Final, was also much publicised.

On 26 June 2006, Ablett was allegedly assaulted at 11:15pm while browsing through a car yard in Fyans Street, South Geelong. A 31-year-old Geelong man was charged with the assault. However, he was reported to have committed suicide on 10 July 2006 by jumping from a Melbourne high-rise apartment block the day before he was due to appear before the Geelong Magistrates court to defend the assault charges.

In December 2007, Ablett hit back at media claims that his son Nathan had walked away from his football career because of the publicity surrounding the release of a new book about his father. Although normally reluctant to make public comments, Ablett felt that the media intrusion into his family life had gone too far. As part of a series of books, &quot;Legends of Australian Sport&quot;, Ablett contributed to a book regarding himself. It was the first time he revealed intimate details regarding his life publicly.

In September 2020, Ablett released a 27-minute YouTube video discussing his belief in the rapture as being forthcoming. In this video, he declared that the COVID-19 pandemic had been manufactured and released by the Illuminati and Freemasons in order to depopulate Earth, create a cashless society and &quot;put Lucifer on the throne of the world&quot;.

===A footballing family===
Two of Ablett&#x27;s brothers played in the Victorian Football League – Kevin Ablett, who played for Hawthorn, Richmond and Geelong, and Geoff Ablett, who played for Hawthorn, Richmond and St Kilda.

Ablett&#x27;s eldest son, Gary Jr., has followed in his footsteps to play for Geelong. In 2007 and 2009, Ablett Jr. won the Cats&#x27; best and fairest award, emulating a feat established by his father in his first season with the Cats back in 1984; he also won the Brownlow Medal in 2009 and 2013. Another son, Nathan, was drafted in 2004 (48th pick) by Geelong under the father–son rule. Nathan initially refused to play AFL Football because of his father&#x27;s experience with the media, but, with encouragement from the club, was signed ahead of the 2005 AFL Season and established himself in the full forward role Gary Sr. made his own.

On 29 September 2007, both Gary Jr. and Nathan contributed to Geelong winning its first flag in 44 years, capturing the premiership that proved elusive to Gary Snr in his 12 years at the club. Nathan retired suddenly before the 2008 season, but he and his brother Gary Jr. were members of the Gold Coast Football Club&#x27;s inaugural team for the 2011 season.

In addition to his sons, Ablett has a nephew, Luke Ablett, who played for the Sydney Swans and won a premiership with them in 2005. Two other nephews, from his sister&#x27;s marriage to Hawthorn legend Michael Tuck, also played in the AFL – Richmond&#x27;s Shane Tuck and Travis Tuck, who played for Hawthorn.

===Criminal offences===
Ablett had well-documented off-field problems, particularly with illegal drug use, and depression in the wake of the Alisha Horan death. In 1990, Ablett was placed on a $10,000 good behaviour bond after he pleaded guilty to repeatedly hitting a man he found sitting in a car with his estranged wife.

In 2000, Ablett was investigated, charged and convicted of four drug offences as a result of twenty-year-old Geelong woman Alisha Horan dying of a drug overdose (involving heroin, ecstasy and amphetamines) while in Ablett&#x27;s hotel room. After a prolonged period of refusing to answer police questions and refusing to answer questions at an April 2001 inquest (on the grounds that he may incriminate himself), Ablett later admitted to providing Horan with heroin and ecstasy. Horan had found a small quantity of heroin in Ablett&#x27;s coat pocket and asked him what it was. Rather than admit that it was heroin, Ablett told her it was cocaine, which they both then ingested, leading to Horan&#x27;s overdose. Ablett was charged with, and pleaded guilty to four drugs charges, and was convicted and fined $1500.

==Concussion lawsuit==
In April 2023, Ablett commenced legal proceedings in the Supreme Court of Victoria against the AFL and the Geelong and Hawthorn football clubs claiming breach of duty and negligence over AFL-related brain injuries that he suffered during his playing career.

==Statistics==
In 2019, a sharp-eyed &quot;footy history enthusiast&quot; by the name of Stephen Wade noticed a statistical discrepancy while watching a YouTube video of a 1982 game that had been uploaded in 2017. He found a discrepancy with the goal total, as he saw Ablett kick two but was only credited for one. Wade brought his discovery to the attention of Col Hutchinson, the AFL&#x27;s statistics and history consultant, who updated the official records. The goal, which had been erroneously attributed to Hawthorn teammate Richard Loveridge for 37 years, increased Ablett&#x27;s total goal tally from 1,030 to 1,031.

<text>Young Bosnia () refers to a loosely organised grouping of separatist and revolutionary cells active in the early 20th century, that sought to end the Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Its members, primarily Bosnian Serbs but also Bosniaks and Bosnian Croats, were driven by various ideologies, prominently Yugoslavism, the unification of South Slavic peoples into a single Yugoslav state. The group drew inspiration from a diverse range of philosophical influences, including German Romanticism, anarchism, and Russian revolutionary socialism. Young Bosnia&#x27;s activities were influenced by historical events such as the Battle of Kosovo and figures like Fyodor Dostoevsky and Friedrich Nietzsche.

The most infamous act associated with Young Bosnia was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914 by Gavrilo Princip, one of its members.

== Background ==

The 1878 occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria-Hungary changed the political circumstances in the region from a long-term status quo under the Ottoman Empire. In 1882, an uprising broke out against the Austro-Hungarian military and administrative occupation authorities, but was suppressed by force.

There were a number of youth-oriented organizations before the rise of Young Bosnia, such as United Serb Youth in the 1860s and 1870s. Defining membership and the vague idea of &quot;youth&quot; (omladina) was debated at length among South Slavic intellectuals. One major obstacle to defining and organizing the youth in Bosnia-Herzegovina was the educational system, which underwent major changes in the Habsburg period. By 1900, a small but growing number of young men from Bosnia were studying in Prague, Zagreb, Vienna, Graz, Istanbul, and Belgrade. This put them in touch with Serbian and Croatian nationalist circles.

The rise to power of the popular Karađorđević dynasty in Serbia in the 1900s after the May Overthrow of the Obrenović dynasty by the Serbian Army in 1903, stimulated support by both Serbs and South Slavs for their unification into a state led by Belgrade. The Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia in 1908 ignited a crisis in European politics and unrest in the province. The establishment of the Diet of Bosnia happened only in February 1910, and the 1910 Bosnian parliamentary election in May the same year. In June 1910, Bogdan Žerajić attempted to assassinate General Marijan Varešanin, the Austro-Hungarian governor of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Support for revolutionary Yugoslavism in Bosnia grew with the rise of the Serb-Croat Progressive Organization in 1911 which drew in support for the cause from Serbs as well as Croats and some Bosnian Muslims. The organization was a youth society led by Ivo Andrić that promoted unity and friendship between Serb and Croat youth and opposed the Austro-Hungarian occupation, but was decried by nationalists and harassed by the government.

== Formation, membership and ideology ==

In 1909 the Young Bosnia was a loose circle of mainly Bosnian Serb students whose interest in revolutionary and romantic Yugoslavism was prompted by the annexation. The extent and significance of the influence from neighbouring Kingdom of Serbia has been debated by historians, and it seems that the interactions between Young Bosnia and Black Hand were largely initiated by the former, rather than the latter.

Vladimir Gaćinović was the ideologue of Young Bosnia and of tyrannicide as its method of political struggle. In 1911 Gaćinović published an article titled &quot;Young Bosnia&quot; in Almanac () published by Prosvjeta.

Petar Kočić led the most ardent anti-Austrian Serb nationalists and had ties to Young Bosnia. While there has been a published claim about how the name of Young Bosnia was first mentioned by Petar Kočić in the journal &quot;Homeland&quot; () in 1907, this was apparently a mistake about the year of publication.

The members were predominantly school students, primarily Serbs but also Bosniaks and Croats. There were several motivations promoted among different members of the group. There were members who promoted Yugoslavist aims of pan-South Slav unification of territories including Bosnia into a Yugoslavia. There were members such as Dimitrije Mitrinović, one of its leading ideologists, who promoted Serbian nationalist aims of pan-Serb unification into Serbia. Young Bosnia was inspired from a variety of ideas, movements, theorists, and events; such as German romanticism, anarchism, Russian revolutionary socialism, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Friedrich Nietzsche, and the Battle of Kosovo.

== Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria ==

Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914 by Gavrilo Princip, a member of Young Bosnia. The group received assistance from the Black Hand, a secret organisation founded by members of the Serbian Army. During a Serbian court-martial in French-occupied Salonika in 1916–17, Chief of Serbian Military Intelligence Dragutin Dimitrijević, known as &quot;Apis,&quot; claimed responsibility for organising the assassination. Apis used his influence over the Serbian military and the Black Hand to smuggle weapons and assassins into Austrian-occupied Bosnia. Following the trial&#x27;s conclusion on 26 June 1917, Apis was executed by firing squad. Vladimir Gaćinović, the only Young Bosnia leader to join the Black Hand, condemned the assassination in a letter after the First World War began, presumably to evade responsibility.

Princip during his trial:


Claimed members of Young Bosnia who participated in the assassination were:

*Danilo Ilić (27 July 1890 – 3 February 1915)
*Veljko Čubrilović (1 July 1886 – 3 February 1915)
*Miško Jovanović (15 June 1878 – 3 February 1915)
*Nedeljko Čabrinović (2 February 1895 – 20 January 1916)
*Vladimir Gaćinović (25 May 1890 – 11 August 1917)
*Trifko Grabež (28 June 1895 – February 1916)
*Gavrilo Princip (25 July 1894 – 28 April 1918)
*Muhamed Mehmedbašić (1886 – 29 May 1943)
*Cvjetko Popović (1896 – 9 June 1980)
*Vaso Čubrilović (14 January 1897 – 11 June 1990)

An evening before the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, Princip, Čabrinović and Ilić visited the grave of Bogdan Žerajić for the last time. Žerajić&#x27;s proclamation &quot;He who wants to live, let him die. He who wants to die, let him live&quot;, was quoted by Gavrilo Princip in one of the songs he wrote ().

== Legacy ==
=== Museum of Young Bosnia ===
The Museum of Young Bosnia was built in the period of SFR Yugoslavia in 1953, at the place where the assassination took place. It commemorates the assassins, popularly known in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia as the &quot;Vidovdan heroes&quot;. At the front of the museum was a plaque, inscribed: &quot;From this place, on 28 June 1914, Gavrilo Princip, expressed with his shot the people&#x27;s revolt against tyranny and their centuries-old struggle for freedom. (Са овога мјеста 28. јуна 1914. године Гаврило Принцип својим пуцњем изрази народни протест против тираније и вјековну тежњу наших народа за слободом.)&quot; In 1992, soldiers of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina destroyed both the plaque and Princip&#x27;s footprints. German forces had removed the 1930 plaque in 1941. The museum still exists today, but nowadays documents aspects of life in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina during Austro-Hungarian rule.

<doc id="670137" wikidata="Q7575105" url="?curid=670137" title="Spectacular mark">
<text>A spectacular mark (also known as a specky, speckie, speccy, screamer or hanger) is a mark (or catch) in Australian rules football that typically involves a player jumping up on the back of another player.

The spectacular mark has become a much celebrated aspect of the sport. Many of the winners of the Australian Football League&#x27;s annual Mark of the Year competition could be considered &#x27;speckies&#x27;, and commentators will often call an individual specky &quot;a contender&quot; in reference to this competition and the mark&#x27;s likeliness to win it.

== History ==

Up until the early 1870s, Australian football was typically played low to the ground in congested rugby-style packs, and as such marks were generally taken on the chest. Occasional high marks were recorded; as early as 1862 a Melbourne Football Club player was praised for leaping &quot;wonderfully high into the air&quot; to mark the ball. Spectacular marks became more common in the 1880s, a time in which the game&#x27;s style of play opened up and teams adopted positional structures resembling those in use today. Essendon&#x27;s Charlie &quot;Commotion&quot; Pearson was a prominent high-flyer of this period. An 1886 match report captured the excitement his aerial skills were generating: &quot;Mr Pearson ... gave spectators many thrilling moments with his phenomenal leaps skyward. What a thrill the game would become as a spectacle if all players tried out this new idea.&quot; Albert Thurgood was a later exponent at the turn of the century. 
It was only when the push-in-the-back rule was introduced in 1897 that high-flyers were protected from being pushed in mid air. This prevented potential serious injury. 

In the 1900s, an &quot;unintentional interference&quot; (incidental contact) rule (i.e. jumping on an opponent&#x27;s back in an effort to mark the ball in the air is not considered a push), first introduced by the VFL in 1904 which reached widespread adoption by the Australasian Football Council in 1907. This paved the way for forwards to climb up opposition players&#x27; backs to take spectacular marks.

Dick Lee consistently pulled down high marks in the early 1900s. In South Australia, Harold Oliver was considered the best exponent of the high-flying mark prior to World War I. In the 1920s, Roy Cazaly was a frequent exponent, as was Bob Pratt in the 1930s. In the 1940s, John Coleman was known for his high marking. In the 1970s, Paul Vander Haar and Peter Knights were renowned for their aerial prowess.

The 1980s saw an era of increased professionalism including the use of the ruck pad in training, as well as long direct kicking, combining to produce more aerial feats. Several players in this decade would consistently take spectacular marks, including Gary Ablett Snr and Trevor Barker. It also became common for exponents of the spectacular mark to achieve extra elevation by levering or propping the hands or arms off the shoulders of opponents. Warwick Capper was a regular proponent of this technique. According to the strict interpretation of the rules, this is in fact illegal interference. Sometimes, however, umpires would interpret in favour of the marking player if the interference was minor and deemed to be part of the jumping action. The AFL Rules Committee in 2007 effectively disallowed this type of spectacular mark altogether with a polarizing adjustment of the &quot;hands-on-the-back&quot; rule. The intention was that players would use vertical leap only; however, it did not increase the frequency of spectacular marks and resulted in many more frustrating free kicks. Many players use their arms and hands to balance naturally while in the air to gain greater height without pushing their opponent. As a result, the AFL relaxed this interpretation again in 2018.

==In popular culture==
The specky has been widely celebrated in Australian popular culture. The phrase &quot;the big men fly&quot; is invariably used to describe speckies and ruckmen contesting a ball-up, and has even spawned a play of the same name, written by Alan Hopgood and first staged in 1963. Alex Jesaulenko&#x27;s famous specky in the 1970 VFL Grand Final gave rise to the catchphrase &quot;Jesaulenko, You Beauty!&quot;. Songs such as Mike Brady&#x27;s &quot;Up There Cazaly&quot; (1979) also celebrate the popular spectator phenomenon. In his poem &quot;The High Mark&quot;, Bruce Dawe sees the specky as an expression of the human aspiration to fly. The poem ends with a footballer falling &quot;back to Earth&quot;—a &quot;guernseyed Icarus&quot;.

There is also a popular series of football-themed children&#x27;s novels, co-written by Felice Arena and AFL star Garry Lyon, named &quot;Specky Magee&quot;.

In Australian slang, a stepladder describes the player over whom another player marks to take a &quot;specky&quot;. In the past, full-backs have been renowned for inadvertently acting as stepladders.

Some players have achieved fame for their role as stepladders of famous marks, including Graeme &quot;Jerker&quot; Jenkin, who was the stepladder for Alex Jesaulenko&#x27;s mark in the 1970 VFL Grand Final. Melbourne band TISM wrote the 1986 song &quot;The Back Upon Which Jezza Jumped&quot; about him.

Strong full-backs Gary Pert, Mick Martyn, Chris Langford and Matthew Scarlett have been stepladders for speckies on multiple occasions.

Warren Tredrea was the stepladder of a rare Grand Final spectacular mark taken by Paul Chapman in the 2007 AFL Grand Final.

In some rare cases, a would-be stepladder becomes a springboard when the marking player gets a secondary boost off another player. A famous example is a 2001 Essendon–Western Bulldogs game where Essendon&#x27;s Gary Moorcroft took Mark of the Year by using Western Bulldogs&#x27; Brad Johnson as a springboard, a mark which many consider to be the greatest mark of all time.

<text>Larry LaPrise ( Roland Lawrence LaPrise) (November 11, 1912 - April 4, 1996) at one point held the U.S. copyright for the &quot;Hokey Pokey&quot; song.

LaPrise was born in Detroit, Michigan. He wrote &quot;Do The Hokey Pokey&quot; in the early 1940s for the après-ski crowd at a club in Sun Valley, Idaho. The song was first recorded by his group the Ram Trio (on the record they&#x27;re known as the Sun Valley Trio) (with Charles Macak and Tafit Baker) in 1948. They were awarded U.S. copyright in 1950.
The authorship of the Hokey Pokey is disputed, with Irish songwriter Jimmy Kennedy having published the original &quot;Cokey-Coney&quot; in 1942. Robert Degan sued LaPrise for copyright infringement of his 1946 &quot;The Hokey-Pokey Dance&quot;. They settled out of court.

After the group broke up in the mid-1960s, LaPrise worked for the Post Office in Ketchum, Idaho.
LaPrise died, aged 83, in Gooding, Idaho.

<text>Kawaiahaʻo Church is a historic Congregational church located in Downtown Honolulu on the Hawaiian Island of Oʻahu. The church, along with the Mission Houses, comprise the Hawaiian Mission Houses Historic Site, which was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark (NHL) in 1962. In 1966 it and all other NHLs were included in the first issuance of the National Register of Historic Places.

At one time the central church of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi and chapel of the Hawaiʻian royal family, the church is popularly known as “Hawaiʻi&#x27;s Westminster Abbey”. The name comes from the Hawaiian noun phrase &quot;ka wai a Haʻo&quot; (“the water of Haʻo”), because its location had a spring and freshwater pool of a High Chiefess named Haʻo. It has also been called &quot;hale pule lahui&quot; (“Great Stone Church”), the Hawaiian Tabernacle (&quot;luakini&quot;), the Mother Church, the Kingʻs Church, the Kingʻs Chapel, and the &quot;&quot;Aliʻi&quot; Church&quot;.

Today, Kawaiahaʻo continues to use the Hawaiian language for parts of its services. It is the oldest church on Oʻahu and one of the oldest standing Christian places of worship in Hawaiʻi, although four thatched churches stood at or near the site of the present coral church. The oldest standing church is Mokuaikaua Church on the Island of Hawaiʻi. Denominationally, it is part of the United Church of Christ.

== History ==
The Kawaiaha&#x27;o mission was started in 1820. The stone building of Kawaiahaʻo Church was commissioned by the regency of Kaʻahumanu, during the reigns of Kamehameha II and Kamehameha III. Designed by Rev. Hiram Bingham in the New England style of the Hawaiian missionaries, it was constructed between 1836 and 1842 of some 14,000 thousand-pound slabs of coral rock quarried from an offshore reef on the southern coast of Oʻahu. Hawaiian divers dove three to six metres below sea-level to chisel out each coral block with hand tools, and the blocks then were transported from the reef onto the shore.

The church house rivaled the concurrent construction of the Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace by the Roman Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of the Hawaiian Islands. Construction began on that churchhouse in 1840 and was substantially completed in 1843, one year after the completion of Kawaiahaʻo Church.

The name Kawaiahaʻo was not applied to the site until 1853.

Kawaiahaʻo Church was frequented by the chiefs of the Hawaiian Islands as well as the members of the reigning Kamehameha dynasty and Kalākaua dynasty. Kamehameha III, Kamehameha IV, Kamehameha V and Kalakaua took their oaths of office to their constitutions at Kawaiahaʻo Church. State burials were also held at the church as well the baptisms of aliʻi including aliʻi members who would eventually convert to other denominations or faiths.

Today, the upper gallery of the sanctuary is adorned with 20 portraits of Hawaiian royalty (Aliʻi). The body of King Lunalilo, who preferred burial in a church cemetery to burial in the Royal Mausoleum, is buried in a crypt along with his father near the front courtyard.

But Kawaiahaʻo Church was not the only site of royal worship in the Islands. Kamehameha IV and his wife Emma were devout members of the Church of England and established the Anglican Church of Hawaiʻi, which evolved into the present-day Episcopal Diocese of Hawaiʻi after the islands were annexed by the United States and later gained statehood. The royal couple commissioned the construction of the Cathedral Church of Saint Andrew, which replaced Kawaiahaʻo Church as the principal centre of royal worship. Kamehameha V, Kalākaua, and Liliʻuokalani (after the rebellion which overthrew the kingdom) preferred to use the cathedral – even though, before her reign, then Princess Liliʻuokalani had directed the choir of Kawaiahaʻo Church. When Liliʻuokalani died in 1917, she lay in state in the church for a week before her funeral at Iolani Palace.

== People associated with the church ==

Other well-known persons associated with the church include:

* Kīnaʻu, kuhina nui of the Hawaiian Kingdom;
* Timothy Kamalehua Haʻalilio, the Hawaiian envoy that helped to secure Hawaiian independence;
* John (Ioane) Iʻi, an advisor to Kamehameha III and teacher at the Chiefʻs Children School;

<doc id="670153" wikidata="Q682306" url="?curid=670153" title="Izanami">
<text>, formally referred to with the honorific , is the creator deity of both creation and death in Japanese mythology, as well as the Shinto mother goddess. She and her brother-husband Izanagi are the last of the seven generations of primordial deities that manifested after the formation of heaven and earth. Izanami and Izanagi are held to be the creators of the Japanese archipelago and the progenitors of many deities, which include the sun goddess Amaterasu, the moon deity Tsukuyomi and the storm god Susanoo. In mythology, she is the direct ancestor of the Japanese imperial family. In Shinto and Japanese mythology, Izanami gave humans death, so Izanami is sometimes seen as a shinigami.

==Name==
Her name is given in the () both as &quot;Izanami-no-Kami&quot; (伊弉冉神) and &quot;Izanami-no-Mikoto&quot; (伊邪那美命), while the (720 AD) refers to her as &quot;Izanami-no-Mikoto&quot;, with the name written in different characters (伊弉冉尊).

The names &quot;Izanagi&quot; (&quot;Izanaki&quot;) and &quot;Izanami&quot; are often interpreted as being derived from the verb (historical orthography ) or &quot;iⁿzanap&quot;- from Western Old Japanese &#x27;to invite&#x27;, with &quot;-ki&quot; / &quot;-gi&quot; and &quot;-mi&quot; being taken as masculine and feminine suffixes, respectively. The literal translation of Iⁿzanaŋgî and Iⁿzanamî are &#x27;Male-who-invites&#x27; and &#x27;Female-who-invites&#x27;. Shiratori Kurakichi proposed an alternative theory which instead sees the root &quot;iza-&quot; (or rather &quot;isa-&quot;) to be derived from &quot;isao&quot; (historical orthography: &quot;isawo&quot;) meaning &#x27;achievement&#x27; or &#x27;merit&#x27;.

==Goddess of creation==
The first gods Amenominakanushi and Kunitokotachi summoned two divine beings into existence, the male Izanagi and the female Izanami, and charged them with creating the first land. To help them do this, Izanagi and Izanami were given a spear decorated with jewels, named (heavenly spear). The two deities then went to the bridge between heaven and earth, &quot;Ame-no-ukihashi&quot; (&quot;floating bridge of heaven&quot;), and churned the sea below with the spear. When drops of salty water fell from the spear, Onogoroshima was created. They descended from the bridge of heaven and made their home on the island.

Eventually they wished to be mated, so they built a pillar called &quot;Ame-no-mihashira&quot; (天の御柱,&quot;pillar of heaven&quot;; the &quot;mi-&quot; is an honorific prefix) and around it they built a palace called &quot;Yahiro-dono&quot; (八尋殿, one &quot;hiro&quot; is approximately 1.82 m, so the &quot;eight-&quot;hiro&quot;-palace&quot; would have been 14.56 m. In reality, &quot;ya, was a sacred number to the Japanese, and may often be translated as ‘myriad’&quot;). Izanagi and Izanami circled the pillar in opposite directions and, when they met on the other side, Izanami spoke first in greeting. Izanagi did not think that this was proper, but they mated anyhow. They had two children, Hiruko (&quot;leech-child&quot;), who later came to be known in Shinto as the god Ebisu, and Awashima, but they were born deformed and were not considered deities.

They put the children into a boat and set them out to sea, then petitioned the other gods for an answer as to what they did wrong. They were told that the male deity should have spoken first in greeting during the marriage ceremony. So Izanagi and Izanami went around the pillar again, this time Izanagi speaking first when they met, and their marriage was finally successful.

From their union were born the &quot;Ōyashima&quot;, or the &quot;great eight islands&quot; of the Japanese chain:
*&quot;Awaji&quot;
*&quot;Iyo&quot; (later Shikoku)
*&quot;Oki&quot;
*&quot;Tsukushi&quot; (later Kyūshū)
*&quot;Iki&quot;
*&quot;Tsushima&quot;
*&quot;Sado&quot;
*&quot;Yamato&quot; (later Honshū)
:Note that Hokkaidō, Chishima and Okinawa were not part of Japan in ancient times.

They bore six more islands and many deities. Izanami died giving birth to the child Kagu-tsuchi (incarnation of fire) or Ho-Musubi (causer of fire). She was then buried on Mt. Hiba, at the border of the old provinces of Izumo and Hōki, near modern-day Yasugi of Shimane Prefecture. Izanagi was so angry at the death of his wife that he killed the newborn child, thereby creating dozens of deities.

==In the &quot;Kojiki&quot;==
The talks of the death of Izanami and her tomb, which was located at the boundary between country Izumo and Hōki. It implies that Izanami transferred her soul to an animal and a human before her death, but does not state whether or not Izanami had incarnations.

==Death and the underworld==

Izanagi-no-Mikoto lamented the death of Izanami-no-Mikoto and undertook a journey to Yomi (&quot;the shadowy land of the dead&quot;). He searched for Izanami-no-Mikoto and found her. At first, Izanagi-no-Mikoto could not see her for the shadows hid her appearance. He asked her to return with him. Izanami-no-Mikoto informed Izanagi-no-Mikoto that he was too late. She had already eaten the food of the underworld and was now one with the land of the dead. She could no longer return to the living but would try to ask for permission to leave.

The news shocked Izanagi-no-Mikoto, but he refused to leave her in Yomi. While Izanami-no-Mikoto was sleeping, he took the comb that bound his long hair and set it alight as a torch. Under the sudden burst of light, he saw the horrid form of the once beautiful and graceful Izanami-no-Mikoto. She was now a rotting form of flesh with maggots and foul creatures running over her ravaged body.

Crying out loud, Izanagi-no-Mikoto could no longer control his fear and started to run, intending to return to the living and abandon his death-ridden wife. Izanami-no-Mikoto woke up, shrieking and indignant, and chased after him. She also sent &quot;Yakusa-no-ikazuchi-no-kami&quot; (demons who are like &quot;Raijin&quot;) and &quot;shikome&quot; (foul women) to hunt for Izanagi-no-Mikoto and bring him back to Yomi. 

Izanagi-no-Mikoto burst out of the entrance and pushed a boulder in the mouth of the &quot;Yomotsuhirasaka&quot; (; cavern that was the entrance of Yomi) to create a separation between the world of the living and the world of the dead, as well as separating Izanagi from Izanami.

Izanami-no-Mikoto screamed from behind this impenetrable barricade and told Izanagi-no-Mikoto that if he left her she would destroy 1,000 residents of the living every day. He furiously replied he would give life to 1,500 residents.

Izanagi is said to have performed ritualistic cleansing, &quot;harai&quot;, after witnessing the decomposing body of his wife. This is the traditional explanation for the purification rituals often performed at Shinto shrines in Japanese religion, where shrine-goers wash themselves with water before entering the sacred space. While he bathed, Izanagi gave birth to the sun goddess, Amaterasu, from his left eye, the moon god, Tsukuyomi, from his right eye, and the storm god, Susanoo, from his nose.

==In the &quot;Nihonshoki&quot;==
While similar in many aspects, the version of the tale of Izanagi and Izanami in the &quot;Nihonshoki&quot; differs from the version in that Izanagi does not descend into the Underworld (Yomi), instead residing permanently on the island of Awaji in a temple. Additionally, in the &quot;Nihonshoki&quot;, the three deities Amaterasu, Tsukiyomi, and Susanoo were said to have been created by both Izanagi and Izanami, instead of Izanagi alone.

==In Tenrikyo==
In Tenrikyo, Izanami-no-Mikoto is one of the .

== In popular culture ==
Izanami appears as a playable god in the video game &quot;Smite&quot;. She also, alongside Amaterasu and Susanoo, appears in the video game &quot;DKO&quot; (&quot;Divine Knockout&quot;). Izanami is a recurring important character in the &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; video game series; such as being the true primary antagonist in &quot;Persona 4&quot;.

&quot;Austin music&quot; in its modern form emerged in 1972 when &quot;a new form of country music exploded on the scene that turned its back on Nashville and embraced the counterculture&quot;, much of it centered around the Armadillo World Headquarters music venue, which opened in 1970, alternating country and rock music shows. In 1972, Willie Nelson left Nashville and moved to Austin.

Austin has become renowned as a haven for young innovative musicians who were drawn in by the creativity, liberal politics, and low cost-of-living. Austin&#x27;s reputation continued to grow and become celebrated for its folk, blues, jazz, bluegrass, Tejano, zydeco, new wave, punk, and indie music scenes.

The City also hosts the Austin Symphony, Austin Civic Orchestras, Austin Opera, Austin Baroque Orchestra and La Folia Baroque.

== History ==

A large portion of Austin&#x27;s early musical heritage began in the German Beer Gardens and Halls in the late 1800s, in places such as Scholz Garten and Hall (the hall later to become Saengerrunde Hall) and further up the road at Dessau Hall. Dessau Hall peaked in the 1940s and 1950s with acts as diverse as Glenn Miller, Hank Williams, and Elvis Presley. 

Other major venues for country music included Big Gil&#x27;s on South Congress and The Skyline on North Lamar. Local singer/yodeler Kenneth Threadgill opened Threadgill&#x27;s in 1933 on North Lamar, a venue that later hosted Folk/Country jams where Janis Joplin participated in her early days. On the east side of town, which historically had a rich culture of African American heritage and influence, music venues such as the Victory Grill, Charlie&#x27;s Playhouse, Big Mary&#x27;s, Ernie&#x27;s Chicken Shack, and Doris Miller Auditorium featured local and touring acts. These destinations, which were part of the &quot;Chitlin&#x27; Circuit&quot; featuring big bands, jazz and blues, became famous for later hosting musical legends including Duke Ellington, Ray Charles, Bobby Bland, B.B. King, Ike Turner and Tina Turner.

In 1964 the Broken Spoke opened, featuring country acts such as Bob Wills, Ernest Tubb, and the young Willie Nelson. The late-1960s and 1970s saw the country music popularized by Willie Nelson and others being joined by a host of other music brought by the more liberal inhabitants, who migrated to Austin during these two decades. Specifically, Roky Erickson and his 13th Floor Elevators helped bring in this psychedelic era.

In the 1960s in Austin, Texas, legendary music venues included the Vulcan Gas Company and the Armadillo World Headquarters and musical talent like Janis Joplin, the 13th Floor Elevators, (Johnny and Edgar) Winter brothers, Shiva&#x27;s Headband and, later, Stevie Ray Vaughan. Austin was also home to a large New Left activist movement, one of the earliest underground papers, The Rag, and graphic artists like creator Gilbert Shelton, underground comix pioneer Jack Jackson (Jaxon), and surrealist armadillo artist Jim Franklin.
The Vulcan morphed into the Armadillo World Headquarters in 1970 and for more than ten years featured music of all genres, from Bruce Springsteen to Bette Midler, as well as local ballet, blues and jazz. The artwork from this establishment was a part of the Austin scene and the Armadillo became the Austin city animal. Songs such as Gary P. Nunn&#x27;s &quot;London Homesick Blues&quot; (which includes in the chorus &quot;I want to go home with the armadillo&quot;) made this a staple of Austin. The artist who began the Armadillo logo was Jim Franklin, who is still working today.

&quot;Austin music&quot; in its modern form emerged in 1972 when &quot;a new form of country music exploded on the scene that turned its back on Nashville and embraced the counterculture&quot;. Eddie Wilson had opened the Armadillo World Headquarters music venue in 1970, alternating country and rock music shows, but in 1972, Willie Nelson left Nashville and moved to Austin, following others including Michael Martin Murphey, Marcia Ball, Steve Earle, Gary P. Nunn, Jerry Jeff Walker, Ray Wylie Hubbard, and Waylon Jennings. 

Willie Nelson&#x27;s audiences at the Armadillo included both hippies and rednecks. On New Year&#x27;s Eve, Austin&#x27;s local KOKE-FM radio station switched to a new programming format geared to the mixed crowds first called &quot;country rock&quot;, and later &quot;progressive country&quot;.

By November of that year; the first pilot for the iconic Austin City Limits was being filmed with Willie Nelson, Billboard Magazine named KOKE “the most innovative radio station in the country,&quot; and Austin had a national reputation thanks largely to the reporting of Rolling Stone stringer Chet Flippo, who seemed to get a dispatch from the Armadillo into every issue.&quot;&quot;&quot;

In the following years, Austin gained a reputation as a place where struggling musicians could launch their careers in front of receptive audiences, at informal live venues. A major influence during this time was Clifford Antone and the namesake blues club he founded in 1975, at the age of 25. Antone&#x27;s located on Austin&#x27;s 6th Street fostered the careers of a number of musicians, including Stevie Ray Vaughan. 

Liberty Lunch was a live-music venue in Austin and during its heyday in the late 1970s and 1980s featured all kinds of music, including reggae and ska, punk, indie, country and rock. The venue was forced to close to make way for Austin&#x27;s downtown redevelopment in the late 1990s. Since then, Liberty Lunch has attained a legendary status in the history of Austin music. Now-defunct Armadillo World Headquarters has attained a similar status.

Austin&#x27;s live music scene has experienced a resurgence in the past few years after losing some of its best loved venues (Liberty Lunch, Armadillo and others), a host of new clubs have risen up to continue Austin&#x27;s rich live music heritage. However, The Hole in the Wall, open since 1974 and a live music staple that lent a corner and then finally a stage to Doug Sahm and Blaze Foley, is still operating. Places such as the Skylark Lounge, Stubb&#x27;s, Ginny&#x27;s Little Longhorn, and a list of others have also become a stalwart of a new generation of live music venues throughout the city.

The punk/new wave era in Austin began in earnest in 1978. The Club Foot played an important role in hosting many of the local punk/new wave acts. The city&#x27;s first two rock/new wave bands, the Skunks and the Violators, made their debut at a University-area club called Raul&#x27;s in February. 

The explosive show by the Sex Pistols in San Antonio the previous month helped build toward an excited reception for local purveyors of the style. The Skunks&#x27; lineup consisted of Jesse Sublett on bass and vocals, Eddie Munoz on guitar and Bill Blackmon on drums. The Violators featured Kathy Valentine (later of The Go-Go&#x27;s), Carla Olson (later of the Textones), Marilyn Dean and Sublett on bass. The Violators were short-lived, as all the members except for Sublett moved to LA the following year. Margaret Moser, of the Austin Chronicle, later wrote that &quot;The Skunks put Austin on the rock n&#x27; roll map.&quot; Another influential band that led the punk scene in Austin was the Big Boys.

Austin became one of the important stops on every tour of important punk/new wave acts. Many of these bands, such as the Police, Joe Jackson, Blondie and Talking Heads, played at the Armadillo. A number of them, including the Clash, Elvis Costello and Blondie, would make appearances at gigs by the Skunks and take the opportunity to jam with the band.

The 1980s and 1990s also helped shape Austin&#x27;s music scene. Waterloo Records, which has been voted the best independent record store in the country and hosts live in-store shows, first opened in 1982. Austinite Stevie Ray Vaughan won a Grammy in 1990 for best contemporary blues album. After tragically dying in a helicopter crash, he was memorialized with a statue on the shores of Austin&#x27;s Lady Bird Lake. Additionally in 1991, Austin city leaders named Austin, &quot;The Live Music Capital of the World&quot;, because of the number of live music venues.

Visitors and Austinites alike may notice the 10-foot guitars standing on the sides of the city&#x27;s streets. In 2006, Gibson Guitar brought Guitar Town to Austin, placing 35 of these giant guitars around the city.

The Austin Music Foundation is one of several Austin groups that help independent artists further their music careers. Assisting musicians with medical needs are the SIMS Foundation and Health Alliance for Austin Musicians (HAAM). Promotion, preservation and education is the mission of the Austin Blues Society, formed in 2006 by Kaz Kazanoff and other blues community notables. 

Helping to promote the $1 billion music industry in the city is the Austin Music Office. A department of the Austin Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau, the Austin Music Office offers creative, personalized assistance in booking live music, discounted Austin Compilation CDs and mini-guides to the city&#x27;s live music scene, assistance with utilization of live music venues for off-site events, and guidance with local music attractions and creation of music tours.

== Television ==
The PBS live music television show &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; began in 1974 and has featured, , over 500 artists of various genres, including rock, folk, country, bluegrass and zydeco. Partly responsible for Austin&#x27;s reputation as a live music hub, the show is broadcast worldwide and stands as the longest running music television program ever. On February 26, 2011, &quot;ACL&quot; held its first taping in its new purpose-built Moody Theater and studio in downtown Austin&#x27;s W Austin Hotel and Residences. Despite a seating capacity of over 2,700, audiences will be limited to around 800 (the original total seating capacity of the old studio). The additional seating capacity will be used for the &quot;ACL Live&quot; concert series at the venue.

Austin was also home to the Austin Music Network (AMN), which broadcast from 1994 to 2005. AMN, featured on cable channel 15, proclaimed itself to be the only non-profit independent music television channel, and its programming was mostly music videos or recorded live sessions, interspersed with presenters. Although all musical tastes were broadcast, AMN emphasized non-mainstream music such as indie, punk, blues, country and jazz.

Channel 15 was a 24-hour music channel now run by Music and Entertainment Television (M*E). M*E launched October 1, 2005, and was broadcast to Austin and the 44 surrounding cities. M*E was a regional network dedicated to showcasing and providing television exposure for regional artists as well as the hundreds of touring groups that make up the vibrant Texas live music scene. Supporting established artists and promoting and discovering new talent is a priority. M*E represented different musical genres and areas of the arts community with numerous original programs highlighting everything from filmmakers to art galleries, and musicians to the ballet. In addition, M*E&#x27;s mostly music lineup, spotlighted live performance footage, concept music videos as well as biographies, reviews, restaurant tours and more.

<text>Moosehead Breweries Limited is Canada&#x27;s oldest independent brewery, located in Saint John, New Brunswick. The brewery was founded in 1867 and is still privately owned and operated by the Oland family. The company is now in the sixth generation of family ownership.

In 2003, Moosehead Lager won a Gold award at the World Beer Cup, and earned another at Monde Selection in 2005. In 2015, Moosehead won a single Gold award in the Canadian Brewing Awards where most of the winners are craft beers. In 2016, two of the company&#x27;s products won a Gold and a Silver award, respectively.

This company had an estimated four percent share of the Canadian domestic market in 2018. Since all major competitors are owned by multi-nationals, Moosehead is now the largest fully Canadian-owned brewer. This is a private company that is not required to release financial information, but the IBISWorld Industry Report on Breweries in Canada stated the company was expected to generate $263.8 million in revenue over 2016.

== History ==

In 1865, Susannah Oland moved from England to Nova Scotia, Canada. With her husband John and nine other employees, Susannah opened The Army and Navy Brewery in 1867, a name that came after their most appreciative customers. After John Oland&#x27;s untimely death in 1870, the brewery changed its name to S. Oland, Sons and Co. Over the next eight years, the brewery faced two fires, but recovered after each. In 1886, Susannah Oland died, and the company went to her two sons, Conrad and George. With the approach of the 20th century, the company changed its name to the Maritime Brewing &amp; Malting Co. It faced hard times once again when the Halifax Explosion of 1917 killed Conrad Oland and destroyed the brewery. A year later, George Oland and his sons moved to Halifax and bought another brewery. In 1928, George bought a second, larger brewery in the city of Saint John, New Brunswick, site of the present day facility.

In 1931, the symbol of the moose came into existence as George launched &quot;Moosehead Pale Ale&quot;. After the success of its &quot;Pale Ale&quot;, the Oland-owned brewery changed its name to Moosehead Breweries Ltd. in 1947. Thirty-one years later, in 1978, the brewery president Philip Oland expanded the brand and launched &quot;Moosehead Lager&quot; in the United States. In 1982, Derek Oland, then the president of the company (after succeeding his father P.W. Oland), expanded the company worldwide.

In his autobiography &quot;Lucky Man&quot;, Michael J. Fox relayed how he told Jay Leno as a guest on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, that he did not like American beer, describing it as &#x27;too watery&#x27; and that he instead would drink&quot; Moosehead Ale&quot;. Not long afterwards, a huge truckload of &quot;Moosehead&quot; Ale made its way to Fox&#x27;s house as a free gift from the company.

Once a popular premium import beer in the United States that was distributed by RJR Nabisco, Moosehead lost vast market share in the 1980s when it lowered its price in an attempt to compete with larger US brewers on price instead of quality and prestige.

Today, Derek Oland&#x27;s sons Andrew, Patrick and Matthew are the sixth generation of Olands to own and work for the family brewery. Andrew is the current president, Matthew is a Vice President and Patrick is the CFO. Moosehead sells its beer throughout Canada, in many US locations, and in 15 countries around the world. Moosehead USA has recently become its own importer, replacing its importing partner Gambrinus. Moosehead wholly owns the Niagara Falls Brewing Company in Ontario.

In 2005, Moosehead Lager won Gold at the prestigious Monde Selection; the company had also won Gold medals at the World Beer Cup and 2003 Canadian Brewing Awards.

In 2008, Moosehead sold its minority interest in McAuslan Brewing to Les Brasseurs RJ. McAuslan will continue to brew and distribute Moosehead beer in the province of Quebec. In the same year, Derek Oland&#x27;s son Andrew assumed the role of President.

The annual Canadian Brewing Awards recognizes the best beers in Canada using blind taste tests. Most of the 2015 and 2016 winners were craft beers. However, some were made by larger brewers, including Moosehead; this company won a Gold in 2015 for their Pale ale and a Gold and Silver, respectively for their Alpine Lager and Cracked Canoe in 2016. For the 2017 competition, new rules allow for entries only from fully Canadian-owned breweries (and that includes Moosehead) for the 55 categories of beer.

In June 2016, the company announced plans to build a small-batch brewery. In January 2017 however, Moosehead announced that the plan had been cancelled because it could not be achieved within the intended budget.

In addition to overwhelming success, the Oland dynasty has also experienced tragedy with the Murder of Richard Oland who had been a Vice President of Moosehead until 1981. (Richard Oland had vied with his brother Derek for the control of Moosehead. Their father, P.W. Oland, decided to select Derek to succeed him as president; Richard subsequently left the company.)
On July 7, 2011, the body of 69-year-old Richard Oland was found dead in his Saint John office at the investment firm Far End Corp. Oland had been bludgeoned to death. His son Dennis Oland, a financial planner, was charged in 2015 with second degree murder. Throughout the high-profile court case, intimate details about the private lives of the entire family were revealed. On conviction in December 2015, Dennis Oland was sentenced to life in prison, with no possibility of parole for at least 10 years.

Less than a year later, in October 2016, the New Brunswick Court of Appeal threw out his conviction based on errors made by the trial judge, and ordered a new trial. The Crown attorneys said they would ask the Supreme Court of Canada for leave to appeal the lower court ruling; the defense said it might request a full acquittal from the Supreme Court.

In 2018, the company decided to redesign the labeling of its products for a &quot;fresh and modern look and to attract millennial consumers while not alienating an older demographic&quot;, starting in April. At the time, Moosehead products had a 4% market share in Canada, and 5% in the province of Ontario.

In 2019, the Canadian Premier League announced that Moosehead would be the official domestic brewery for the league.

== Stolen batch ==
In August 2004 a truck driver transporting over 50,000 cans of Moosehead beer to Mexico for a Mexican supermarket chain disappeared with the beer, leaving the nearly empty transport truck abandoned in a parking lot in Grand Falls, New Brunswick. Easily identified by the Spanish writing on the labels (which is not distributed in English and French speaking Canada) the beer was slowly tracked.

The first signs of the missing beer showed up in Fredericton, New Brunswick, with two empty cans; another report of two cans were reported later in northern New Brunswick. Police working on a tip eventually found the truck driver in Ontario; earlier in the same week, police discovered nearly 8,000 cans of the stolen beer in a trailer that went off the road near Woodstock, New Brunswick.

With most of the beer recovered and the driver in custody, the police in the New Brunswick area began to look in wooded areas for the remaining beer. Knowing the area in which the police were looking, many civilians took up the search as well. Because of the media attention on the story almost all of the beer was quickly found by civilians and police, and most of it was returned to Moosehead Breweries.

The final piece of the story occurred in October 2004 when 200 cans of the stolen beer were found at a marijuana growing operation in the forest near Doaktown, New Brunswick about 100 kilometres northeast of Fredericton. &quot;Six of the cans were discovered with bite marks in them indicating a bear had, at one point, been into the beer,&quot; the RCMP said in a news release. The release said there was no sign of either the animal or the people who had stashed the beer. Eventually, after a lengthy investigation, a total of 14,000 cans were recovered. Wade Haines, a New Brunswick truck driver, was found guilty of stealing the shipment and was sentenced to 19½ months in jail.

The unique and quirky nature of this crime story made international headlines and resulted in publicity for Moosehead; it has also been the basis of a book.

== Second stolen batch ==
In September 2007, two tractor trailers carrying 77,000 cans and 44,000 bottles with a reported retail value of $200,000 were stolen from a transport company in Mississauga, Ontario. Peel Region police arrested a man from Vaughan, Ontario during the first week of October 2007 and charged him with possession of stolen property. Police believe he is responsible for the theft and of selling the beer to bars and after-hours clubs and that he may not have worked alone.

<text>The Torne, also known as the Tornio (, , , , ), is a river in northern Sweden and Finland. For approximately half of its length, it defines the border between these two countries. In the upper parts, the river is situated in Sweden before it meets the Muonio River where it adjoins the international border. It rises at the lake Torneträsk near the border with Norway and flows generally southeast for a distance of into the Gulf of Bothnia. It is the largest river in Norrbotten County both by length and by watershed area.

At its source, the Torne is located close to the North Atlantic and Narvik on the other side of the watershed, with several thousands of kilometres between the locations via waterways.

== Geography ==
The Torne basin has a total area of or (see sidebar). Of this, or is in Sweden, or is in Finland and or is in Norway.

=== Nominal source and hydrological source ===
The source of the Torne is generally believed to be the lake Torneträsk near the border with Norway.
But the main feeder of this lake is Abiskojåkka, flowing out of Abiskojaure, which is mainly fed by Kamajåkka, coming from tributary Gamajávri. This lake&#x27;s major tributary is Válfojohka. That river comes from Lake Válfojávri in Norway&#x27;s Nordland, but near to that lake it is joined by a nameless, longer stream, according to official Swedish maps fed by a small glacier, above sea level ().

=== Lake Torne ===
Other affluents of Lake Torne are Njuoraätno and Kåppasjåkka in the west, Gurttejohka, Snurrijåkka, Bessešjohka, Bággesgorsajohka, Davip Duoptejohka, Lulip Duoptejohka, Sarvájohka and others in the north, and Rákkasjohka, Gohpasjohka, Miellejohka, Bessešjohka, Golkkokjohka, Nivsakkjohka and others in the south.
Above Torne lake, the watershed of the Torne includes the villages Riksgränsen, Katterjåkk, Vassijaure, Låktatjåkka, Kopperåsen and Tornehamn. 
On the south shore of Torne lake are Björkliden, Abisko, Stordalen, Kaisepakte. Stenbacken and Torneträsk.
On the north shore are the Sami villages Laimoluokta and Kattuvuoma.

=== Upper river ===
Beyond the lake, the Torne River flows unhindered by any concentrations of human inhabitants until the village of Kurravaara, around northeast of Kiruna.
The river splits in two parts that only join at Kurravaara; the part between the river is Alajávri nature reserve.
Between the lake and Kurravaara, the streams Čearrojogaš and Rávdojohka join on the right side, and shortly before Kurravaara, the long Rautas River
flows into the Torne.
On the left side, the streams Gukkajohka, Reaskkajohka and Dápmokjohka join.
In the area between the two streams, the Beallejohka joins the right arm from the left.

After Kurravaara, the river proceeds Laxforsen, where it is joined from the right by the Luossajoki.
Here is the first bridge over the river for the road leading from the E10 to Laxforsen, Luossajärvi and Esrange. The river continues to Jukkasjärvi, where an ice hotel is built in winter from the river ice.

==== To the Bifurcation ====
Beyond Paksuniemi, the river is joined by the Pounujoki from the right.
At Vittangi, the long Vittangi river, which passes by Esrange, joins from the left.
Here is the second river-crossing bridge, used by the E45 to Karesuando.
The river then proceeds to Kuoksu, where it is crossed by the road to Lainio and Oksajärvi, and to Juopakosku, where the Junojoki joins from the left.
At Junosuando, the Torne river loses 56% of its water to the Tärendö River in one of the four bifurcations in the watershed area.
Here is also a bridge for the road to Kangos and Parkolombolo; this is the fourth bridge over the river.

Shortly after Junosuando, the Piipionjoki joins from the left and at Palokorva, the long Lainio River joins from the left.
In the Lainio River watershed are two more, smaller bifurcations: the lakes Goldajávri, Råstojaure flow toward contributaries of the Laino river as well as to the Norwegian streams Signaldalselva and Råstaelva respectively.

==== Down to Pajala ====
Between Junosuando and Pajala, the Käymäjoki joins from the left and the Liviöjoki and the Mertajoki join from the right.
The village Anttis is located on the left bank of the river, with Swedish road Riksväg 395 on the right bank; the fifth bridge connects Anttis to the main road.
Shortly after Pajala, the Torne river joins with the long Muonio River, the biggest contributary of the Torne river.
Near Pajala are two more bridges going north.
North of this point, the Muonio river forms the border with Finland.
From this point, the border with Finland is formed by the Torne river.

=== Lower river ===

From here the river flows south along the Finno-Swedish border.
This part is known as Meänmaa and is a popular tourist destination.
Slightly south of Pajala is a border-crossing bridge for a road leading to Kolari, the eighth bridge over the main river from the source.
The river proceeds to the village Kassa.
At the village of Pello, which lies on both sides of the river, is a bridge between the two parts.
The river continues south to Svanstein, crosses the arctic circle at Juoksengi and proceeds to Niskanpää and Kuivakangas.
In Övertorneå (Finnish: Ylitornio) there is another bridge, the final road bridge before the sea.
Here, the long Tengeliön River joins from the (Finnish) left side .
The river continues to Hedenäset and Risudden.

At Karungi, the Liakanjoki departs from the Torne river and flows to the Gulf of Bothnia independently in Finland.
From Karungi south, there are railways on both sides of the valley.
At Kukkola is Kukkolaforsen, a rapids which is also a tourist attraction.
Before finally arriving at the twin city of Haparanda/Tornio, it passes by the villages Vojakkala and Mattila.

In the twin city of Haparanda/Tornio are four more bridges: one for cyclists and pedestrians, one for local traffic, one for the E4 and the southernmost, last and 14th bridge over the Tornio river is a dual gauge railway bridge connecting the Swedish and Finnish railway systems.

== History ==
Antti Keksi authored a poem about the 1677 river flood.

In the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809, when Sweden lost the areas which constitute present-day Finland to Imperial Russia, the river was together with the Muonio River and Könkämä River chosen as border between Sweden and the new Russian Grand Duchy of Finland, thus splitting the provinces of Lappland and Västerbotten.

According to the treaty, the border shall follow the deepest part of the river. Near Haparanda/Tornio the border was fixed in the treaty, partly on land, so the city of Tornio would belong to Russia. Once every 25 years, a commission of Swedish and Finnish representatives shall review this border. This means that the border can move, such as in 2006 when such a border change was undertaken.

==Natural history==
Research on ice breakup on the river and on Lake Suwa in Japan suggested &quot;global processes including climate change and variability are driving the long-term changes in ice seasonality.&quot;

== Culture ==

Historically, the language used on both sides of the river was Finnish. In the late 19th century, schools were opened in both countries. Then there was a decision to make the Swedish part of area Swedish speaking by teaching the school children only written Swedish and allowing only Swedish to be spoken during lessons, sometimes also during breaks. As an effect, during the second half of the 20th century, Swedish was the dominant language on the Swedish side. The Finnish spoken in informal conversation is similar on both sides of the river, although some newer words differ. To support the traditional language on the Swedish side a new written language has been devised, Meänkieli. On the Finnish side only Finnish is used in written communication. These two languages differ considerably in spelling.

<text>, or sometimes Torne Valley or Torne River Valley (; ) lies at the border of Sweden and Finland. It is named after the Torne River flowing through the valley and into the Gulf of Bothnia. Geographically the townships and municipalities that make up the area are Haparanda, Övertorneå, Pajala and Kiruna in Sweden, and Tornio, Ylitornio, Pello, Kolari, Muonio and Enontekiö in Finland. Culturally the highland Swedish municipality Gällivare is sometimes also considered part of Meänmaa due to the large share of Meänkieli-speaking population in it. Torne Valley should not be confused with Torne Valley Sub-region.

Meänkieli surnames and village names are common on the Swedish side of the border to this day, in spite of the dominance of the Swedish language in the area. The Finnish side of the border has standard Finnish as the sole spoken language.

== History and culture ==

The cultural environment around the Torne River is characterized by agriculture, reindeer farming and fishing.
Meänmaa was one of the oldest inhabited areas in northern Finland. Archeological excavations have revealed evidence of permanent settlements at least from the 11th century, but there are signs of earlier settlements.
Agriculture has long been practiced on the fertile flooding meadows by the river. Trading routes followed the river and some trading centers were formed. One of the centers since 16th century was the island Oravaisensaari at Vojakkala. Today, the main center is the twin city of Haparanda-Tornio.

The Finnish and Swedish sides of the river were once one cultural entity, as before 1809 they were both parts of Sweden. Once the current border between the two countries had been established, each side of the river has become influenced by the majority culture in its respective country, but still retains some traditional elements.

== Language ==

On the Swedish side of the valley, Finnish was still the majority language until the 20th century. This is obvious in the many Finnish village and other place names on the Swedish side of the border. The number of Finnish speakers has now declined drastically, because of national Swedish influence and compulsory schooling in Swedish. People in the younger generations mostly have Swedish as their primary language, though it is still widely spoken in many homes as a secondary language.

The local Finnic variant, Meänkieli, has been recognised as a minority language in Sweden. The people who speak it are often referred to as Tornedalians, although this term could also be defined as referring to people living in Meänmaa, who are not all speakers of Meänkieli. The originally Finnish-speaking land area is far greater than the actual river valley; it extends as far west as Gällivare. Although confusing from a geographic point of view, this whole area is often referred to as Meänmaa. Meänmaa, Sápmi and Swedish areas bind together, most places in Norrbottens län have three names, but are mostly called by their Swedish name which often just has a different spelling. For example Kiruna is called Kieruna (Meänkieli), Giron (North Sámi), and Kiruna (Swedish), but is mainly known as Kiruna.

The area where Meänkieli is spoken is also called &quot;Meänmaa&quot;. Since 15 June 2006, the Tornedalians have their own flag.

<text>The Shaking Ray Levis is an ongoing collaboration of musicians with a common interest in free improvisation. The project was conceived and led by the Chattanooga, Tennessee-based team of Dennis Palmer and Bob Stagner. They use storytelling, synthesizers, samplers and percussion to achieve their distinctive sound. They are the first American group to have recorded for Incus Records, the record label of British free improvisational guitarist Derek Bailey. Additionally, they have performed and recorded with Borbetomagus, John Zorn, David Greenberger, Killick Erik Hinds, Fred Frith, Min Tanaka, Amy Denio, and Derek Bailey, as well as with many other critically acclaimed artists.

Dennis Palmer died in Chattanooga on February 15, 2013.

<text>David Laʻamea Kahalepouli Kinoiki Kawānanakoa (February 19, 1868 – June 2, 1908) was a prince of the Hawaiian Kingdom and founder of the House of Kawānanakoa. Born into Hawaiian nobility, Kawānanakoa grew up the royal court of his uncle King Kalākaua and aunt Queen Kapiʻolani who adopted him and his brothers after the death of their parents. On multiple occasions, he and his brothers were considered as candidates for the line of succession to the Hawaiian throne after their cousin Princess Kaʻiulani but were never constitutionally proclaimed. He was sent to be educated abroad in the United States and the United Kingdom where he pioneered the sport of surfing. After his education abroad, he served as a political advisor to Kalākaua&#x27;s successor, Queen Liliʻuokalani until the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom in 1893. After Hawaii&#x27;s annexation to the United States, he co-founded the Democratic Party of Hawaii.

== Birth and family ==
Kawānanakoa was born February 19, 1868, at Kaʻalaʻa at the mouth of the Pauoa Valley, in Honolulu, on the old homestead of his aunt Queen Kapiʻolani. Kawānanakoa was the first child of his father David Kahalepouli Piʻikoi from Kauaʻi island, and his mother Victoria Kinoiki Kekaulike, a noble from the district of Hilo who was later the royal governor of the island of Hawaiʻi. His younger brothers were Edward Abnel Keliʻiahonui (1869–1887) and Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole (1871–1922).

Both his parents were linked to the reigning House of Kalākaua. Kawānanakoa&#x27;s mother was the youngest sister of Queen Kapiʻolani, consort to King Kalākaua, who ruled from 1874 to 1891. Kawānanakoa&#x27;s father was also King Kalākaua&#x27;s paternal first cousin.

His family was of the aliʻi class of the Hawaiian nobility and traced their descents to the ruling lines of each of the Hawaiian Islands prior to conquest. His mother&#x27;s paternal line goes back to the ruling families of the island of Hawaiʻi while her maternal grandfather was King Kaumualiʻi, the last ruler of an independent Kauaʻi before its cession to King Kamehameha I who united the Hawaiian Kingdom in 1810. Kaumualiʻi was also descended from the ruling families of Maui and Oʻahu. Kawānanakoa&#x27;s father&#x27;s paternal line was descended from a junior line of Kauaʻi while his father’s mother maternal line also originated from the ruling line of Hawaiʻi Island.

His name Kawānanakoa translates as &quot;fearless prophecy&quot; in Hawaiian. Born with the surname Piʻikoi, Kawānanakoa and Kalanianaʻole (more commonly referred to as Kūhiō) later adopted their given Hawaiian names as their surname. Sources state the brothers either changed their names in 1883 or 1891.

=== Royal succession ===
At a young age, Kawānanakoa and Kūhiō were &quot;hānai&quot; (informally adopted) by the childless Kapiʻolani and Kalākaua while the second brother Keliʻiahonui was &quot;hānai&quot; by their other maternal aunt Poʻomaikelani.

After their father&#x27;s death in 1878, his mother Kekaulike brought Kawānanakoa and his brothers to live in Honolulu. The family split their times living with the king and queen on the premise of the old ʻIolani Palace or at Kapiʻolani&#x27;s private residence Pualeilani in Waikīkī where the Hyatt Regency Waikiki now stands. After the completion of the new palace in 1882, they occupied a in large second floor bedroom, which later became known as the &quot;Imprisonment Room&quot; because it was where Kalākaua&#x27;s successor Queen Liliʻuokalani was imprisoned in 1895.

On February 10, 1883, Kawānanakoa was granted by letters patent the title of Prince and style of His Royal Highness by King Kalākaua along with his mother, brothers and aunt. On February 14, Kawānanakoa served as bearer of the crown and Kūhiō as either the bearer of the &quot;palaoa&quot; or the consort crown during Kalākaua&#x27;s and Kapiʻolani&#x27;s coronation ceremony at ʻIolani Palace.
After the death of Kekaulike in 1884, Kalākaua and Kapiʻolani assumed legal guardianship over all three boys.

In Kalākaua&#x27;s will drafted in 1888, Kawānanakoa and his brother Kūhiō (their other brother Keliʻiahonui was deceased by this point) were included in a proposed line of succession after Liliʻuokalani, the king&#x27;s niece Princess Kaʻiulani, Queen Kapiʻolani, and Princess Poʻomaikelani. The king also furthered outlined that he wished in the case that the throne passed to Kawānanakoa or his brother that they &quot;assume the name and title of Kalakaua, and to be numbered in order from&quot; him.

On Article 22 of proposed 1893 Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom, Queen Liliʻuokalani outlined the succession to include Kaʻiulani followed by Kawānanakoa and Kūhiō and their legitimate heirs.

== Education ==
Kawānanakoa and his brothers were educated at St. Alban&#x27;s College (now ʻIolani School) and Oahu College (now Punahou School). After completing their basic education in Hawaii, they also traveled abroad for further study. His uncle King Kalākaua championed future Hawaiian leaders attaining a broader education with his 1880 Hawaiian Youths Abroad program. The Hawaiian government sent Kawānanakoa and his brothers to attend Saint Matthew&#x27;s School, a private Episcopal military school in San Mateo, California. Kawānanakoa was enrolled in the fall of 1884 and his younger brothers were enrolled in the spring of 1885. Keliʻiahonui fell ill at school and returned to Hawaii where he died. Kawānanakoa and Kūhiō returned to Hawaii shortly afterward. 

Kawānanakoa would also attend the Royal Agricultural College in Cirencester from 1890 to 1891.

While attending school in San Mateo, Kawānanakoa and his two brothers would travel south to the Pacific seashore at Santa Cruz. The brothers demonstrated the Hawaiian sport of board surfing to the locals, becoming the first California surfers in 1885. In September 1890, Kawānanakoa and Kūhiō became the first surfers in the British Isles and taught their English tutor John Wrightson to surf on the beaches of Bridlington in northern England.

== Political career ==

On August 31, 1891, Queen Liliʻuokalani appointed Kawānanakoa as a member of her Privy Council of State, a constitutionally-created advisory body purposed to advise and consent to acts made by the monarch. 
Kawānanakoa was also created Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Order of Kalākaua.

Liliʻuokalani was overthrown on January 17, 1893, and the Provisional Government of Hawaii established under pro-annexation leader Sanford B. Dole was officially recognized. The queen temporarily relinquished her throne to the United States, rather than the Dole-led government, in hopes that the United States would restore Hawaii&#x27;s sovereignty to the rightful holder. A pro-annexationist delegation headed by Lorrin A. Thurston was sent by the provisional government for Washington, D.C., on January 19, to lobby for immediate annexation by the United States. The queen wrote letters to President Benjamin Harrison and President-elect Grover Cleveland outlining her case. However, the provisional government refused the queen&#x27;s request to send her own envoys on the same ship as their delegation. Liliʻuokalani appointed Kawānanakoa and her lawyer Paul Neumann to represent her case. Archibald Scott Cleghorn paid for the travel expenses of Edward C. Macfarlane, another of the queen&#x27;s envoys, to protect the rights of his daughter Princess Kaʻiulani. Annexationist William Richards Castle, who was a commissioner on Thurston&#x27;s delegation, described Kawānanakoa as &quot;a very pleasant fellow,&quot; but, &quot;of course, [is] purely ornamental.&quot;

The trio left Honolulu on the &quot;Australia&quot; on February 2, arrived in San Francisco on February 11, and reached Washington, DC, on February 17. Macfarlane and Kawānanakoa were dispatched to present the queen&#x27;s letter to President-elect Cleveland. While in New York, Kawānanakoa also visited his cousin Princess Kaʻiulani, who was in the United States to protest the proposed annexation of Hawaii, with her guardian Theophilus Harris Davies. Dissent developed between Davies and Liliʻuokalani&#x27;s representatives in the United States over Davies&#x27; influence over Kaʻiulani. Kawānanakoa along with Neumann, Macfarlane and John Mott-Smith, the Hawaiian Minister to the United States, voiced criticism at Davies&#x27; action in bringing Kaʻiulani to the United States without the consent of Cleghorn or the queen. Cleveland was inaugurated on March 4. The new president withdrew the treaty of annexation from the Senate on March 9 and appointed James Henderson Blount on March 11 as special commissioner to investigate the overthrow. Neumann, Macfarlane and Kawānanakoa returned on April 7.
After the formation of the Republic of Hawaii, Kawānanakoa became a supporter of the Royalist resistance and opposition to the overthrow of the monarchy. On January 6–9, 1895, supporters of the monarchy launched an unsuccessful counter-revolution led Robert William Wilcox to restore Liliʻuokalani to the throne. After the failed rebellion, the queen was imprisoned in the former bedrooms of the princes at ʻIolani Palace. Documents presented against the former queen at the subsequent trials included signed commissions for a restored monarchial government with Kawānanakoa and Kūhiō as governors of Maui and Kauai, respectively. A month after the rebellion, Kawānanakoa was arrested and jailed at Oahu Prison for misprision of treason on February 21. Kawānanakoa would be released due to lack of evidence. His brother Kūhiō played a more active role in the rebellion and was found guilty by a military tribunal and sentenced to one year imprisonment.

The Republic of Hawaii was annexed via the Newlands Resolution, a joint resolution of Congress, on July 7, 1898. The annexation ceremony was held on August 12, 1898, at the former ʻIolani Palace, now being used as the executive building of the government. President Dole handed over &quot;the sovereignty and public property of the Hawaiian Islands&quot; to United States minister Harold M. Sewall. The flag of Hawaii was lowered, and the flag of the United States was raised in its place. Liliʻuokalani with Kaʻiulani, Kawānanakoa and Kūhiō, their family members and retainers boycotted the event and shuttered themselves away at Washington Place, the private residence of Liliʻuokalani, in mourning. Many Native Hawaiians and royalists followed suit and refused to attend the ceremony.

=== Territory of Hawaii ===

Following annexation, the Hawaiian Organic Act established the Territory of Hawaii.
Kawānanakoa became one of five founders of the Democratic Party of Hawaii.
He attended the 1900 Democratic National Convention in Kansas City, Missouri and was the first royal to attend a national presidential nominating convention, where he was successful in gaining affiliation between his party and the Democratic Party in a party vote at the convention to incorporate Hawaii. He voted to break a tie about inserting a plank into the convention platform regarding free silver.

The Democrats nominated Kawānanakoa to run for the position of delegate to the United States Congress for the Territory of Hawaii in 1900. He placed third behind the Home Rule Party victor Robert William Wilcox and the Republican nominated Samuel Parker. In the subsequent election cycle, his younger brother Kūhiō (who was a former member of the Home Rule Party) joined the Republicans while the Democrats including Kawānanakoa allied with Wilcox. There was allegedly no animosity between the two brothers over the political differences. Kūhiō ended up winning the election, becoming the first former royal prince to serve in the United States Congress.

== Personal life ==
Records indicate that there may have been a written agreement of betrothal with Princess Kaʻiulani, that was quickly aborted. An unsubstantiated announcement dated February 3, 1898, was printed in &quot;The San Francisco Call&quot; and later reprinted in newspapers across the United States. According to the report, the betrothal was dependent upon the finalization of deeds to a sizeable real estate holding, transferred from Queen Kapiʻolani to both Kawānanakoa and Kalanianaʻole. On February 19, a denial of betrothal from Kawānanakoa was printed in the newspapers. Kapiʻolani did deed all her property, real and personal, to the brothers on February 10, with the express stipulation that the documentation not be executed until she was ready. Kapiʻolani wanted to hold off the transfer until she was too old to manage the property herself, and/or otherwise would believe she was close to death. She last saw the document with her notary Carlos A. Long, with her instructions to have changes made in the wording. Instead, the brothers had the deed executed immediately, without her knowledge.

Family lore also conflicts over the exact nature of her relationship with Kawānanakoa. Kaʻiulani&#x27;s niece Mabel Robertson Lucas said that the two cousins were close but only like siblings. Nancy and Jean Francis Webb&#x27;s 1962 biography of Kaʻiulani says that Kawānanakoa&#x27;s eventual wife told an unnamed biographer or close friend that &quot;of course I never could have married David if Kaʻiulani had lived&quot;.
On January 6, 1902, Kawānanakoa married Abigail Wahiʻikaʻahuʻula Campbell in a Roman Catholic ceremony officiated by Patrick William Riordan, Archbishop of San Francisco at the Occidental Hotel. His wife was the eldest daughter of Scots-Irish industrialist James Campbell and Abigail Kuaihelani Maipinepine Bright, who refused to let her daughter marry the prince until he signed a prenuptial agreement. Two days prior, his mother-in-law had remarried to Kawānanakoa&#x27;s former political rival Samuel Parker. After their marriage, Abigail assumed the courtesy title of princess. Their children were Princess Abigail Kapiʻolani (1903–1961), Prince David Kalākaua (1904–1953), and Princess Lydia Liliʻuokalani (1905–1969). His descendants which continues through his daughter Kapiʻolani are recognized by factions of the Hawaiian community as heirs to the Hawaiian throne.

Kawānanakoa converted to Roman Catholicism in 1907, no doubt through the urging of his wife.

Kawānanakoa died of pneumonia June 2, 1908, in San Francisco. After an elaborate funeral, he was buried in the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii.

<text>John Owen Dominis (March 10, 1832 – August 27, 1891) was prince consort of the Kingdom of Hawaii as the husband of Queen Liliuokalani from January 29, 1891, until his death that year.

==Family==

His father was a sea captain named John Dominis (1796–1846) who came to America in 1819 from Trieste during the Napoleonic Wars. He was often called &quot;Italian&quot; from then a family of Venetian &quot;Conti Palatini de Dominis de Arba&quot; (Count Palatines of Rab), that had its origins in the island of Rab, in Dalmatia. His mother, Mary Jones, was an American of English descent. Working for Josiah Marshall of Boston, Massachusetts, Captain Dominis sailed from North America across the Pacific, often stopping in Hawaii. One of his ships used on the trading voyages was called &quot;Owhyhee&quot; (an older transcription of &#x27;O Hawai&#x27;i). The captain married Mary Lambert Jones (1803–1889), daughter of Owen Jones and Elizabeth Lambert, on October 9, 1821, and had two daughters, Mary Elizabeth (1825–1838) and Frances Ann Dominis (1829–1842). About 1831, they moved to Schenectady, New York, and son John Owen Dominis was born on March 10, 1832.

==Early life==
In 1837 the captain moved his wife and son from New York to Honolulu, Hawaii, leaving their two daughters at boarding school where they died young. King Kamehameha III awarded some land to the family in 1842 as settlement of a lawsuit with the British Consul Richard Charlton. The captain continued to take voyages to raise money for the construction of a large house. In 1846 he sailed for China on the Brig &quot;William Neilson&quot;, intending to purchase Chinese-made furniture for the house which was nearing completion. The ship was lost at sea, along with the American Agent George Brown, and Mary became a widow. Mary rented a suite of rooms to support herself and young John Owen. One of the first boarders established the American Legation in the house and named it &quot;Washington Place&quot;. It was used as a governor&#x27;s residence and is now a museum.

John attended a day school run by Mr. and Mrs. Johnston that was next to the Royal School founded for the children of the native Hawaiian nobility. Dominis would climb the fence to look at the princes and princesses, and became friends with them.
For a time, Dominis was a mercantile clerk in San Francisco, and later he served as a clerk in a Honolulu commercial house. By 1856 he was on staff to a Prince, and accompanying the royal family on their travels.

==Prince consort==
On September 16, 1862 Dominis married Lydia Kamakaʻeha Pākī, later Queen Liliʻuokalani, whom he had met during school days. They had been engaged for two years, but had to delay their wedding due to the death of Prince Albert, the young son of King Kamehameha IV. The marriage was not happy. She wanted children of her own, but could not have any. John chose to socialize without her, and Mary Dominis looked down upon her non-caucasian daughter-in-law. Liliʻuokalani notes in her autobiography that his mother considered her an &quot;intruder&quot;, but became more affectionate in her later years.

His marriage to Liliʻuokalani and his friendship with King Kamehameha V brought him many honors. For example, he was a Royal Commander of the Royal Order of Kamehameha, the Royal Order of Kalākaua, and several others.
From 1863 he served on the King&#x27;s Privy Council.
Dominis served from 1864 to 1886 in the House of Nobles, and from 1868 until his death as Royal Governor of Oʻahu. He served on the Board of Health, Board of Education, Bureau of Immigration, and was Quartermaster General and Commissioner of Crown Lands. From 1878 to 1886 he served as Royal Governor of Maui. In 1886, he was appointed Lieutenant General and Commander in Chief.

According to his wife&#x27;s testimony, Governor Dominis was a very dedicated freemason and held the 33rd degree.

Mary Dominis died on April 25, 1889, and he and Liliʻuokalani inherited Washington Place. Liliʻuokalani became Queen when her brother King Kalākaua died on January 20, 1891, which made Dominis Prince Consort. Dominis died less than a year later on August 27, 1891, in Washington Place and was buried in the Royal Mausoleum known as Mauna Ala.

==Issue==

He had a natural son, John ʻAimoku Dominis, with Mary Purdy Lamiki ʻAimoku, a servant of his wife, born January 9, 1883. Liliʻuokalani accepted her husband&#x27;s constant unfaithfulness and adopted her husband&#x27;s son in 1910 and changed his name to John ʻAimoku Dominis. He married Sybil McInerny and left descendants. They continued to live at Washington Place until Liliʻuokalani died on November 11, 1917.

<doc id="670210" wikidata="Q7592795" url="?curid=670210" title="St Chad's College, Durham">
<text>St Chad&#x27;s College is one of the recognised colleges of Durham University. Founded in 1904 as St Chad&#x27;s Hall for the training of Church of England clergy, the college ceased theological training in 1971 and now accommodates students studying the full range of Durham University courses. Its members are termed &quot;Chadsians&quot; and it is the smallest Durham college by number of undergraduates, but has extensive college library facilities and among the highest level of academic performance.

The college&#x27;s main site is on the Bailey, occupying historic Georgian buildings at the east end of Durham Cathedral. It neighbours Hatfield College to its north, while St John&#x27;s College and St Cuthbert&#x27;s Society are to its south. The college is named after Saint Chad, a seventh-century Anglo-Saxon bishop known for spreading Christianity in the Mercian kingdom.

Although Durham students study their degree centrally with the university, St Chad&#x27;s runs its own collegiate studies and tutor system. College societies include the St Chad&#x27;s College Boat Club (SCCBC), theatre company Green Door Productions, and the music society Chad&#x27;s Music.

Gowns are worn by students for formal dining, matriculation and some other college activities, and its members still say grace in Latin. St Chad&#x27;s has a traditional rivalry with the university&#x27;s other recognised college, St John&#x27;s, with an annual &quot;John&#x27;s/Chad&#x27;s Day&quot; featuring sporting competition between the two colleges. The college became fully mixed in 1988, after eight decades of admitting men exclusively.

==History==

=== Hostel and hall ===


In 1902, Frederick Samuel Willoughby, vicar of Hooton Pagnell near Doncaster, opened St Chad&#x27;s Hostel to prepare men of limited financial means for entry to Church of England theological colleges. He was supported by the lady of the manor, Julia Warde-Aldam, who in 1903 funded a dedicated building for the hostel in Hooton Pagnell.

The further financial support of Douglas Horsfall, a wealthy Liverpool businessman and devoted churchman (who also funded the building of several large Anglo-Catholic churches in his home city), made it possible in 1904 to establish a hall at Durham University as a sister institution to the Hooton Pagnell hostel, to allow students to read for university degrees alongside training for ordination. Durham University had a provision in its statutes to recognise independent colleges, permitting students to matriculate through those institutions and then to sit for Durham exams.

A licence from the university was obtained and St Chad&#x27;s Hall opened in October 1904 at 1 South Bailey, Durham, with nineteen students. With the expansion to Durham, Willoughby withdrew from the project and the Revd Stephen Moulsdale, a Durham graduate who had been vice-principal of the hostel, became the first principal of the hall as well as principal of the hostel.

The college soon expanded into neighbouring buildings, starting with 28 North Bailey (adjoining 1 South Bailey) which was rented from the dean and chapter of Durham Cathedral. In 1909, a small wooden chapel was constructed behind the South Bailey buildings, and dedicated by the Bishop of Jarrow.

The Durham hall and Hooton Pagnell hostel continued to operate in partnership, with students studying for a year at the hostel before moving to the hall to complete their studies, until 1916 when the Hooton Pagnell building was requisitioned as a war hospital and all teaching was moved to Durham. The hostel building was returned after the war, and re-opened for a short time, but the financial problems of running in two locations led to the hostel finally closing in 1921.

=== College ===

In 1918, after the college had established a number of endowed fellowships, the university recognised St Chad&#x27;s as the university&#x27;s second college.

The college continued to expand with the lease and purchase of further buildings on the Bailey, including Douglas House at 18 North Bailey, purchased in 1925. In 1928, the current chapel (intended as a temporary building) was built behind Douglas House, with the previous chapel building given to found St Chad&#x27;s Church, Sunderland.

In 1937, C. E. Whiting&#x27;s centenary history of the university recorded that the college had 55 students and five staff, but could easily double its numbers if accommodation were available.

=== Consolidation on North Bailey ===

In the 1960s, the college took steps to consolidate its site on North Bailey, with the houses at the junction of Bow Lane and North Bailey being demolished in 1961 to enable the construction of a new dining hall and quadrangle, designed by neo-classical architect Francis Johnson. These new buildings were joined to existing 18th century houses at 16–18 North Bailey to form the present Main College.

In 1965, the college&#x27;s original home on South Bailey was exchanged with neighbouring St John&#x27;s College for 22 and 22A North Bailey (now Grads House) which with other purchases gave the college a 95m-long frontage on North Bailey.

=== Later events ===

The college ceased formal ordination training in 1971, but remains a Church of England foundation with students studying for degrees across all departments of the university.

St Chad&#x27;s was among the last university colleges in the UK to admit women undergraduates: as a part of a co-ordinated step-change in the university, the final all-male year entered in September 1987.

The college has continued to slowly expand, and new buildings have been acquired to allow for this increase, including former Durham School boarding house Trinity Hall as postgraduate accommodation, and additional houses on North Bailey.

==Buildings==
Students who study at St Chad&#x27;s are accommodated in nine different houses: Queen&#x27;s Court, Epiphany House, Main College, Lightfoot House, Langford House, Grads and Ramsey House and Trinity Hall all accommodate undergraduates; Hallgarth Street and Trinity Hall, along with part of Main College, are home to the college&#x27;s postgraduate community.

Most of the college buildings are Grade II listed. Grade I listed 12th-century castle walls run through the college&#x27;s gardens.

=== North Bailey ===

==== Main College ====

Main College is located at 18 North Bailey, adjacent to Bow Lane, and consists of the college dining hall (the Moulsdale Hall), designed in 1961 by neo-classical architect Francis Johnson, joined to a number of primarily 18th-century houses along North Bailey.

At the centre of Main College, adjacent to the Moulsdale Hall, is the Cassidy Quad. This was originally an open quadrangle between buildings, but was given a glass roof for the college&#x27;s centenary in 2004. Main College houses the college&#x27;s major public areas, including the Junior, Middle and Senior Common Rooms (JCR, MCR and SCR), bar, libraries, the punishment chamber (gymnasium), and most college offices.

The college&#x27;s croquet lawn, chapel and laundry are behind main college, along with walled gardens associated with the historic houses that make up the college.

A graffito on the Bow Lane side of the dining hall reads &quot;Pulchra Semper&quot; (Latin: &quot;always beautiful&quot;), and has been in place since at least the 1970s.

==== Queen&#x27;s Court ====

Queen&#x27;s Court, 1 and 2 North Bailey, is a grade II listed building located at the junction between Saddler Street, North Bailey, and Owengate. It was built in the early 19th century and contains 24 student rooms. The college for many years occupied only 1 North Bailey, while no. 2 housed the Music Department. The two parts were reunited in 2013.

==== Epiphany House ====

Epiphany House, 5 North Bailey, is a Grade II listed house built around 1700 and acquired by the college in 2006 to house undergraduates.

==== Lightfoot House ====

Lightfoot House, 19 North Bailey (directly across the road from Durham Cathedral) is one of the buildings that comprise the college. It consists of two adjacent Grade II listed buildings that were constructed in the 18th century and have since been connected internally. The building is used as a hall of residence for first-year and third-year undergraduates. It is named after Joseph Barber Lightfoot, who was Bishop of Durham from 1879 to 1889.

==== Langford House ====

Langford House, 21 North Bailey, is a Grade II listed building built in the 18th century and named after a former Judaism scholar and College Chaplain. For many decades, it was the home of the college&#x27;s chaplains, but today is used as a hall of residence for third year (and some first year) undergraduate students.

==== Grads House ====

Grads House, 22 North Bailey, is a Grade II listed building used as undergraduate accommodation. The building is largely late 18th-century, with a rainwater head dated 1796, but it contains a notable 17th century staircase. Its name derives from its use in the 1960s and 70s as a residence for students studying for postgraduate diplomas in Theology.

==== Ramsey House ====

Ramsey House, 25 North Bailey, is a Grade II listed building built around 1820, now owned by the college and now used primarily for undergraduate accommodation. It is named for Arthur Michael Ramsey, the 100th Archbishop of Canterbury who was once resident in Ramsey House. He was also a member of the Governing Council for the college.

For many decades, Ramsey House was the home of successive college principals, but it is now given over to student accommodation. There are now seven student rooms, a well-equipped kitchen, a self-contained fellows&#x27; flat, and the Ann Loades room, available for meetings.

=== Other sites ===

==== Trinity Hall ====

Trinity Hall is a former Durham School boarding house, located on Grove Street, across the river from the main college site. It was built in 1847 as the Second Master&#x27;s House, later called Caffinites after Benjamin Charles Caffin, Second Master from 1863 to 1877, before becoming the school&#x27;s junior house under the name Ferens House. It was acquired by the college in 2002 and converted into housing for 25 postgraduates and a house for the college principal. In 2017 the principal&#x27;s house was converted into additional student accommodation.

==== Hallgarth Street ====

30 Hallgarth Street, located across the river from the main college site, is a Grade II listed building constructed around 1840. Formerly the college chaplain&#x27;s house, it is now used as postgraduate accommodation.

=== Libraries ===

There are three library rooms on the ground floor of Main College (the Bettenson Room and the Brewis and Williams Libraries). The Williams Library doubles as a multi-media room and is often used for meetings and lectures. There are two more libraries on the first floor: the Wetherall Library, which houses most of the theology and philosophy collections; and the Reserve Library, which contains the core curricula texts for all of the courses currently on offer in the university (as well as the special church history and liturgy collections). The Fenton Library and the Trounson Library, which opened in October 2006, are located on the third floor. Comprising three separate rooms, the Fenton and Trounson Libraries contain individual study carrels and are used primarily for private study. The college is unusual (in the Durham collegiate context) in the extent to which it has invested in libraries and study space.

The Durham University Library holds most of the college&#x27;s medieval manuscripts and its oldest books, which include a number of 16th and 17th century imprints including Quintus Aurelius Symmachus&#x27;s &quot;Epistolae familiares&quot; and the &quot;Concilia omnia&quot;.

===Chapel===
The college chapel, located behind Main College, was built in 1928, replacing an earlier chapel built on South Bailey in 1909. Intended only as a temporary building, the wood-frame building seats 120 people and has been in continuous use. The chapel&#x27;s contents are older than its structures, with older donated pews from various churches and a ballroom dance floor from a decommissioned ocean-liner. The architecture of the chapel has been described as bearing resemblance to a &quot;colonial mission chapel&quot;. Its reredos of 1923 was designed by William H. Wood.

In 2023, the chapel underwent a thorough refurbishment including a new roof, the restoration and replacement of all damaged segments of its wooden cladding, new lighting and heating systems. This project was paid for in its entirety by the generosity of alumni, supporters and a number of Trusts and Foundations; the names of all who contributed may be seen on a Donors&#x27; Board inside the Chapel.

The chapel is overseen by the college chaplain, an Anglican priest. The college&#x27;s roots in the Catholic tradition of the Church of England are still evident in services in the college chapel. Chapel attendance is entirely voluntary, given that the college accepts students without regard to their religious background.

The college maintains a collegiate choral tradition, headed by the director of music. Membership in the college choir is un-auditioned, except for those wishing to be gain a choral scholarship. The choir is involved in the College&#x27;s outreach work amongst schools and other organisations in the North East and, when possible, goes on tours. The college offers a number of choral and organ scholarships every year.

===Boat house===

The college&#x27;s boat house is located on college-owned land on the banks of the River Wear, below the college&#x27;s original home at 1 South Bailey, now part of St John&#x27;s College. In 2016, the boat house and landing stage were completely replaced.

==College life==

===Academic dress===
Along with most Bailey Colleges, St Chad&#x27;s students wear their college gowns to formal hall, matriculation, college congregations and other academic or formal events. St Chad&#x27;s has also retained its own distinctive academic hood (of black stuff with green lining and trim): previously designed for pre-1970s ordinands, the hood is today worn by honorary fellows. The rector has a distinctive robe (a full-sleeved gown of black corded silk, faced with silver-trimmed palatinate purple, and with sleeves lined with palatinate purple); college officers generally wear the academic regalia associated with their highest degrees.

===Formal hall===
Twice a week throughout most of the whole academic year, members of the college gather for formal hall. This tradition brings students and staff together, though fellows, tutors and their guests sit at high table. This not only enables students who are living out to visit college, but it enables the college to entertain official guests regularly.

Members of the college are required to wear academic gown to formal hall and are turned away and fined when entering the hall late, that is, after High Table have entered. Students and guests stand when the bell signals that the High Table party is arriving. Everyone shall remain standing until a senior student (usually JCR/MCR President, or whoever is presiding at Low Table) says the Grace:

Students are usually refrained from standing throughout the meal, and if must do so for an urgent matter, should stand up and catch the eye of the Principal (or whoever is presiding at High Table) and bow towards them. Once bell sounds at the end of the meal, all students stand again for the evening Grace, remaining standing until after the high table party leaves. A senior student would then recite:

The tradition of &quot;pennying&quot;, as part of a meal or drinking game, whereby dropping a penny in a person&#x27;s drink means that they must finish it (or some such variation thereof) is banned at St Chad&#x27;s College, with risk of possible expulsion from the dining hall by staff members and even fines.

===Traditions and customs===
Along with many of the ancient colleges, St Chad&#x27;s has evolved its own traditions and customs over the centuries.

Though all Durham University students now participate in large matriculation ceremonies in the cathedral, St Chad&#x27;s has, for over a hundred years, conducted its own matriculation. This signifies that students are obliged to follow the regulations of both the university and of the college. Matriculants wear academic dress at the ceremony and every student signs the university&#x27;s matriculation book, thereby sealing an oath to adhere to the rules and traditions of the college and the university.

For over a half-century, the college has conducted an Advent procession in Durham Cathedral. The candle-lit choral service is unusual in not solely anticipating Christmas, but in anticipating the Second Coming, which is the traditional theological focus of the Advent season itself. The choir splits into two, with one group seated in the choir and the other processing from the entrance to the cathedral. The two groups call back and forth to each other, using chants based on the Great Advent Antiphons. These antiphons form the basis not only of the advent procession, but also of the popular advent hymn, &quot;O come, O come, Emmanuel&quot;. The procession is advertised widely in the City of Durham; after the event the college hosts its annual reception for city residents.

The patron saint of the college is Saint Chad of Mercia. On his feast day (2 March), the college features a day-long celebration and begins early in the morning with a noisy wake-up call. After a green breakfast, students wear green clothes and body paint to various events and challenges held throughout the day, including a large mass service in Durham Cathedral and a noon-day run around Palace Green. Various musical and social events are held throughout the day and evening. The college also has a number of feasts throughout the year. Both the Dining Hall and the Quad are used to provide a four-course meal for up to 250 people. Among the largest is the Principal&#x27;s Feast, usually scheduled at the end of the Epiphany term. The Rector&#x27;s Feast, at the end of the Easter term, welcomes the rector to the college for a formal &quot;visitation&quot;.

===Bars===
St Chad&#x27;s College has two bars - one its traditional cellar bar which is an atmospheric social hub built into the College&#x27;s cellars, the second a more recent addition in the College&#x27;s central Quad. The St Chad&#x27;s Bar is one of the few remaining college bars still run by full-time undergraduate students elected by the student body.

=== Junior Common Room ===
Most undergraduates are members of the Junior Common Room (JCR). The JCR committees are elected by the members of the JCR, with these committees running events, aspects of student life and representing JCR members at various levels. As of August 2021, the JCR has the following committees:

* JCR Executive – Has overall responsibility for the activities of the JCR. Consists of the President, Vice-President, Wellbeing Officer, Secretary, Treasurer, Domestic Representative, Bar President, Social Secretary, Representatives&#x27; Committee Chair, Sports Officer and the Chair.
* Bar Committee – Runs the college bar. Consists of the Bar President, Manager, Secretary, Treasurer and Head Cellarman.
* Social Committee – Runs social events throughout the course of the year. Consists of the Social Secretary, Secretary of the Social Committee, Treasurer, Decorations Officer, Technical Officer and Sponsorship &amp; Publicity Officer.
* Wellbeing Committee – Responsible for running campaigns, providing sexual health supplies, signposting and running wellness events around periods of intense academic pressures. Consists of the Welfare Officer, Assistant Welfare Officer, Campaigns Officer(s) and Livers-Out Officer(s).

Other smaller JCR committees include the Candlemas Ball, Sports Committee, and Charity Fashion Show amongst others.

=== Middle Common Room ===
Most if not all postgraduates (consists of all the PhD, MPhil, MA, MSc, and LLM students and students on a four-year Integrated Master&#x27;s programme) are members of the Middle Common Room (MCR). Similar with the JCR, the MCR executives are elected by members of the MCR, and is the representative body for postgraduate students at St Chad&#x27;s College. With 150 postgraduates each year, St Chad&#x27;s enjoy the highest proportion of postgraduates studying and researching alongside undergraduates in any Durham colleges. St Chad&#x27;s MCR is particularly active in research and host regular &quot;Research Forums&quot; where students have the opportunity to present their research to a non-specialist audience. Under its Constitution and Standing Orders, the MCR is governed by the following executives:

* President of the MCR (&quot;ex officio&quot; Governor) – exercise overall responsibility for furthering the Aims and Objectives of the MCR through liaison with the Executives of the JCR and SCR, and any other bodies within the University. The President of St Chad&#x27;s MCR is also ex officio Governor of St Chad&#x27;s College. 
* Secretary of the MCR – administer and take, distribute and file the Minutes of all General Meetings of the MCR and of the Executive Committee. They are also responsible for communicating business of the MCR to its members.
* Treasurer of the MCR – administer the finances of the MCR and is responsible for preparing quarterly reports for the scrutiny of College committees.
* Six Other Executive Officers – six other Executive Officers is elected and take such responsiblities as necessary for the smooth running of the activities of the MCR.
* Chair and Keeper of the Great Seal of the MCR – The Chair of the MCR is an administrative post not of Executive rank in the MCR of St Chad&#x27;s College. It holds responsibility to preside over all General Meetings of the MCR and ensure that the Great Seal of the MCR is not to be removed from the City of Durham, hence its title.

===Societies and events===

St Chad&#x27;s College Boat Club (SCCBC) is the college rowing club and was founded in 1906. It operates from the college boathouse on the River Wear. SCCBC is a registered Boat Club through British Rowing, with Boat Code &quot;SCH&quot; and is a member organisation of Durham College Rowing.

2011 saw the re-establishment of a theatre company at St Chad&#x27;s, Green Door Productions, which aims to promote all aspects of theatre within the college, be it acting, directing, set design or backstage work. In 2011, Australian actor Russell Crowe visited the college to give a masterclass in acting.

The college&#x27;s music scene regularly perform at University events across Durham, including Durham Cathedral. The college ensembles include both a chamber and pop choir, the latter of which were invited to perform at the UK Choir Festival 2024, as well as a Jazz Band and Chamber Orchestra. May 2024 saw students from the college putting on a sell-out performance of Captain Noah and His Floating Zoo at Durham&#x27;s Gala Theatre Durham in May 2024, involving school students from across the county.

Every year the college hosts a Candlemas Ball. Founded in 1956, this is one of the older and more flamboyant balls in the university. It is recognised, along with University College&#x27;s June Ball, as being one of Durham&#x27;s versions of the University of Cambridge&#x27;s May Balls. Due to restrictions on social activities related to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, Candlemas 64 was cancelled, with the decision made for the next event to be called Candlemas 65.

===Arms and motto===
The College was granted its arms in 1951 by the College of Arms. Its blazon are as follows:

: &quot;Vert a Cross potent quadrate Or in chief a Durham Mitre of the last between two Lions rampant Argent.&quot;

The college&#x27;s motto, &quot;non vestra sed vos&quot; (literally &quot;not yours but you&quot;) reflects the college&#x27;s beginnings, when it sought to enable students of modest means to gain access to a university education. The motto commits the college to being concerned with the person, rather than with what the person owns.

==Organisation and administration==
===Status===
St Chad&#x27;s is a &quot;recognised college&quot; of Durham University, but it is not maintained or governed by the university (St John&#x27;s College has the same status). The college was originally licensed by the university as a hall of residence, becoming a college in 1919. The distinction between colleges and halls at that time was more a matter of style than substance, as nothing but the name changed. The college had argued for the change because it had gradually built up several endowed fellowships, which it thought were characteristic more of a college than of a hall (that said, other halls in Durham quickly followed suit without having such endowments). The term &quot;recognised college&quot; was first used in the 1937 statutes to refer to those colleges not maintained by the university.

===Governance===

The college&#x27;s visitor is the Archbishop of York, currently Stephen Cottrell. The visitor exercises customary visitorial functions and is the court of final appeal for any matters referred to the archbishop by the governors. The visitor is appointed by the governors for a renewable five-year period. In matters regarding the university itself (such as those brought forward by students), the university&#x27;s visitor has jurisdiction.

The college&#x27;s rector is Philip Plyming, Dean of Durham. The rector is the titular head of the college, who has responsibility for monitoring the college&#x27;s furtherance of its Anglican foundation and tradition. Ceremonially, the rector presides at certain official functions in college: the role is in some ways akin to the chancellor&#x27;s role in the university.

The college is formed by up to twenty governors who are its legal members, and who act as the trustees of the charity and directors of the limited company. The Chair of Governors is Father Mark Woodruff, an alumnus whose work mainly involves engagement with the civil voluntary sector, especially in the fields of social development and inclusion. He is also a Catholic priest of the Diocese of Westminster, serving also at the Ukrainian Greek Catholic of the Holy Family of London. The university and the dioceses of York, Durham, Newcastle and Carlisle all nominate governors, though they must be elected by the college. The Principal and the Presidents of the Senior, Middle and Junior Common Rooms serve as governors ex officio, and the undergraduates and the tutors may also each nominate a governor for election. Other governors are elected from outside the college.

===Finance===
The college has a modest endowment, which is enough to fund significant annual capital improvements, and a number of named scholarships. A private charity, as opposed to a public body, the college&#x27;s funding comes largely from income raised from student residence fees, from its commercial and conference trade, from philanthropic gifts, and from an annual college fee paid by the University, calculated to match that spent on each maintained college to facilitate the colleges&#x27; wider student experience responsibilities. The college is a registered charity. Its annual turnover is £3.1 million.

===Admissions===
Competition for membership in the college is strong and the St Chad&#x27;s is regularly one of the most over-subscribed colleges in Durham University in terms of applications per place. Applications for postgraduate places similarly outnumber availability. Admissions have been managed centrally by Durham University since 2014. Like other colleges, applicants are considered chiefly on the basis of academic merit, and 90% of undergraduates at St Chad&#x27;s attain a first or upper second class degree.

In the recent past, the college was one of four Durham colleges designated by the university to accept open postgraduate applications in all disciplines, though now virtually all colleges accept such applicants. St Chad&#x27;s has a number of dedicated postgraduate residences and an unusually high percentage (more than 30%) of postgraduate students.

===Patronage===
The governors of the college possess the advowson for ten benefices of the Church of England. Five are located in the Diocese of Liverpool (St Agnes&#x27;, Toxteth; St Stephen&#x27;s with St Catherine&#x27;s; St Faith&#x27;s, Great Crosby; St Paul&#x27;s, Stoneycroft; and St Margaret&#x27;s, Toxteth), two in the Diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich (Hadley (St Mary), and Wratting (Great and Little) and one in each in the Durham (Longnewton), Hereford (Pontesbury) and Leicester (Syston) dioceses. Many of the advowsons were given to the college in the early twentieth century. In the past, the patron would have had complete power to appoint the new priest; that power is now exercised jointly with the local bishop and parish (and often with other patrons).

==Academic profile==
===Institutes===
Though most Durham colleges are primarily residential rather than teaching institutions, St Chad&#x27;s has its own research and academic staff. Responsibility for purely academic matters is overseen by the Principal in consultation with the Fellows, one of whom, Professor Tony Chapman, is head of research and Director of Policy&amp;Practice, working in the fields of government policy and conducting primary research into regional development, regional economics and third sector activities. Other professorial and research fellows and academics associated with the college often work in conjunction with various university departments. Still others work chiefly outside the college and university.

===Charitable activities===
In addition to its primary charitable object of supporting students and scholars in Durham, the college supports the students in volunteering in charities and communities in the local region. To widen participation, the college has created partnerships with a number of secondary schools in the North East and beyond and has worked with primary schools in County Durham and Newcastle upon Tyne, and further afield.

===Collegiate studies===
All Durham colleges are interdisciplinary, enabling staff and students to broaden their study and research interests. St Chad&#x27;s runs a collegiate studies programme, (currently named &quot;Outside the Box&quot;) which complements departmentally-based studies. The programme is explicitly justice-orientated, reflecting the ethos and history of the college. Students and staff are introduced to complex social issues; they are invited to participate in a weekly programme of training-events that go beyond traditional transferable skills to include such things as ethical decision-making and eco-friendly life-strategies.

==Notable people==
===College fellows===
Senior college officers include the Principal, the Vice-Principal, the Finance &amp; Operations Director, the Chaplain, and the Librarian. In addition, St Chad&#x27;s has over 30 college fellows, research fellows and research associates. There are around 50 college tutors who act as mentors for both undergraduates and postgraduates. The College offers a number of visiting fellowships to academics of all disciplines. A further 100 university staff associate themselves with the college, chiefly through membership in the Senior Common Room. The college awards honorary fellowships to those who have made significant contributions to the College, the church or to public life.

<doc id="670219" wikidata="Q1825137" url="?curid=670219" title="Portuguese grammar">
<text>In Portuguese grammar, nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and articles are moderately inflected: there are two genders (masculine and feminine) and two numbers (singular and plural). The case system of the ancestor language, Latin, has been lost, but personal pronouns are still declined with three main types of forms: subject, object of verb, and object of preposition. Most nouns and many adjectives can take diminutive or augmentative derivational suffixes, and most adjectives can take a so-called &quot;superlative&quot; derivational suffix. Adjectives usually follow their respective nouns.

Verbs are highly inflected: there are three tenses (past, present, future), three moods (indicative, subjunctive, imperative), three aspects (perfective, imperfective, and progressive), three voices (active, passive, reflexive), and an inflected infinitive. Most perfect and imperfect tenses are synthetic, totaling 11 conjugational paradigms, while all progressive tenses and passive constructions are periphrastic. There is also an impersonal passive construction, with the agent replaced by an indefinite pronoun. Portuguese is generally an SVO language, although SOV syntax may occur with a few object pronouns, and word order is generally not as rigid as in English. It is a null subject language, with a tendency to drop object pronouns as well, in colloquial varieties. Like Spanish, it has two main copular verbs: &quot;ser&quot; and &quot;estar&quot;.

It has a number of grammatical features that distinguish it from most other Romance languages, such as a synthetic pluperfect, a future subjunctive tense, the inflected infinitive, and a present perfect with an iterative sense.

==Sentence structure==

===Word classes===

Like most Indo-European languages, including English, Portuguese classifies most of its lexicon into four word classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, and adverbs. These are &quot;open&quot; classes, in the sense that they readily accept new members, by coinage, borrowing, or compounding. Interjections form a smaller open class.

There are also several small closed classes, such as pronouns, prepositions, articles, demonstratives, numerals, and conjunctions. A few grammatically peculiar words are difficult to categorize; these include &quot;cadê&quot; (&quot;where is&quot;—Braz., colloq.), &quot;tomara&quot; (&quot;let&#x27;s hope&quot;), &quot;oxalá&quot; (&quot;let&#x27;s hope that&quot;), and &quot;eis&quot; (&quot;here is&quot;; cf. Latin &quot;ecce&quot; and French &quot;voilà&quot;).

Within the four main classes there are many semi-regular mechanisms that can be used to derive new words from existing words, sometimes with change of class; for example, &quot;veloz&quot; (&quot;fast&quot;) → &quot;velocíssimo&quot; (&quot;very fast&quot;), &quot;medir&quot; (&quot;to measure&quot;) → &quot;medição&quot; (&quot;measurement&quot;), &quot;piloto&quot; (&quot;pilot&quot;) → &quot;pilotar&quot; (&quot;to pilot&quot;). Finally, there are several phrase embedding mechanisms that allow arbitrarily complex phrases to behave like nouns, adjectives, or adverbs.

===Subject, object, and complement===

Following the general Indo-European pattern, the central element of almost any Portuguese clause is a verb, which may directly connect to one, two, or (rarely) three nouns (or noun-like phrases), called the subject, the object (more specifically, the &quot;direct&quot; object), and the complement (more specifically, the object complement or objective complement). The most frequent order of these elements in Portuguese is subject–verb–object (SVO, as in examples (1) and (2) below), or, when a complement is present, subject–verb–object-complement (SVOC — examples (3) and (4)):
:(1) &quot;{A Maria}S {ama}V {o Paulo}O&quot;, &quot;Maria loves Paulo.&quot;
:(2) &quot;{O pedreiro}S {construiu}V {a casa}O&quot;, &quot;The mason has constructed the house.&quot;
:(3) &quot;{O presidente}S {nomeou}V o {Pedro}O {ministro}C&quot;, &quot;The president appointed Pedro (as) minister.&quot;
:(4) &quot;{Ela}S {achou}V {o livro}O {uma chatice}C&quot;, &quot;She found the book a bore.&quot;

Any of the three noun elements may be omitted if it can be inferred from the context or from other syntactic clues; but many grammatical rules will still apply as if the omitted part were there.

A clause will often contain a number of adverbs (or adverbial phrases) that modify the meaning of the verb; they may be inserted between the major components of the clause. Additional nouns can be connected to the verb by means of prepositions; the resulting prepositional phrases have an adverbial function. For example:
:&quot;Ele carregou {sem demora} a mala {para ela} {do carro} {até a porta}&quot;, &quot;He carried {without delay} the bag {for her} {from the car} {to the door}.&quot;

===Null subject language===
Portuguese is a null subject language, meaning that it permits and sometimes mandates the omission of an explicit subject.

In Portuguese, the grammatical person of the subject is generally reflected by the inflection of the verb. Sometimes, though an explicit subject is not necessary to form a grammatically correct sentence, one may be stated in order to emphasize its importance. Some sentences, however, do not allow a subject at all and in some other cases an explicit subject would sound awkward or unnatural:
*&quot;I&#x27;m going home&quot; can be translated either as &quot;vou para casa&quot; or as &quot;eu vou para casa&quot;, where &quot;eu&quot; means &quot;I&quot;.
*&quot;It&#x27;s raining&quot; is &quot;está a chover&quot; in European Portuguese, or &quot;está chovendo&quot; in Brazilian Portuguese, neither of which occurs with an explicit subject. Some older speakers say &quot;ele está a chover&quot; &quot;it is raining&quot;, where &quot;ele&quot; &quot;he/it&quot; refers to the masculine subject &quot;o tempo&quot; &quot;the weather&quot;. Nowadays this usage is uncommon and seen as old-fashioned.
*&quot;Que horas são?&quot; &quot;what time is it?&quot; (literally &quot;what hours are they?&quot;). Some older speakers say &quot;que horas são ele?&quot;, where &quot;ele&quot; refers to &quot;o tempo&quot; &quot;the time&quot; (&quot;o tempo&quot; can also mean &quot;the weather&quot;). Nowadays this usage is uncommon and seen as old-fashioned.
*In European Portuguese, only in exceptional circumstances would &quot;I&#x27;m going home; I&#x27;m going to watch TV&quot; be translated as &quot;eu vou para casa; eu vou ver televisão&quot;. At least the second &quot;eu&quot; (&quot;I&quot;) would normally be omitted, if not both. Meanwhile, in Brazilian Portuguese, the subject pronoun is more likely to be repeated.

As in other null subject language with a SVO word order, the subject is often postponed, mostly in existential sentences, in answers to partial questions and in contrast structures:
*&quot;Existem muitos ratos aqui!&quot; (&quot;There are many mice here!&quot;) — Verb &quot;existem&quot;, subject &quot;ratos&quot;, complement &quot;aqui&quot; indicating place.
*&quot;Quem é que foi? Fui eu.&quot; (&quot;Who was it? It was me.&quot;) — Verb &quot;fui&quot;, subject &quot;eu&quot;.
*&quot;Ela não comeu o bolo, mas comi-o eu.&quot; (European Portuguese) or &quot;...mas eu comi&quot; (Brazilian Portuguese) (&quot;She didn&#x27;t eat the cake, but I did.&quot;) — Subject &quot;ela&quot;, negation &quot;não&quot;, verb &quot;comeu&quot;, object &quot;o bolo&quot;; the complement divides itself into: adversative conjunction &quot;mas&quot;, verb &quot;comi&quot;, object &quot;-o&quot;, subject &quot;eu&quot;.

Portuguese declarative sentences, as in many languages, are the least marked ones.

Imperative sentences use the imperative mood for the second person. For other grammatical persons and for every negative imperative sentence, the subjunctive is used.

Yes/no questions have the same structure as declarative sentences, and are marked only by a different tonal pattern (mostly a raised tone near the end of the sentence), represented by a question mark in writing.

Wh-questions often start with &quot;quem&quot; (&quot;who&quot;), &quot;o que&quot; (&quot;what&quot;), &quot;qual&quot; (&quot;which&quot;), &quot;onde&quot; (&quot;where&quot;), &quot;aonde&quot; (&quot;where... to&quot;), &quot;quando&quot; (&quot;when&quot;), &quot;por que&quot; (&quot;why&quot;), etc. The interrogative pronouns &quot;quem&quot;, &quot;o que&quot; and &quot;qual&quot; can be preceded by any preposition, but in this case &quot;o que&quot; will usually be reduced to &quot;que&quot;. Frequently in oral language, and occasionally in writing, these words are followed by the interrogative device &quot;é que&quot; (literally, &quot;is [it] that&quot;; compare French &quot;est-ce que&quot; in wh-questions).
&lt;br&gt;Wh-questions sometimes occur without wh-movement, that is, wh-words can remain &quot;in situ&quot;. In this case, &quot;o que&quot; and &quot;por que&quot; are replaced by their stressed counterparts &quot;o quê&quot; and &quot;por quê&quot; (Brazilian Portuguese) or porquê (European Portuguese).

For example:
:&quot;O que/Que é que ela fez?&quot; or &quot;O que/que fez ela?&quot;
::&quot;What did she do?&quot;
:&quot;Ela fez o quê?&quot;
::&quot;What did she do?&quot; or, if emphatic, &quot;She did &quot;what&quot;?&quot;
:&quot;Por quê?&quot; (Brazilian Portuguese) &quot;/ Porquê?&quot; (European Portuguese)
::&quot;Why?&quot;
:&quot;Em que dia é que isso aconteceu?&quot;
::&quot;On what day did that happen?&quot;
:&quot;Isso aconteceu em que dia?&quot;
::&quot;On what day did that happen?&quot;
In Brazilian Portuguese, the phrase &quot;é que&quot; is more often omitted.

===Replying===

&quot;Não&quot; (&quot;no&quot;) is the natural negative answer to yes/no questions. As in Latin, positive answers are usually made with the inflected verb of the question in the appropriate person and number. Portuguese is one of the few Romance languages keeping this Latin peculiarity. The adverbs &quot;já&quot; (&quot;already&quot;), &quot;ainda&quot; (&quot;yet&quot;), and &quot;também&quot; (&quot;too&quot;, &quot;also&quot;) are used when one of them appears in the question.

:Q: Gostaste do filme? A: Gostei. / Não.
::Q: &quot;Did you like the movie?&quot; A: &quot;Yes.&quot;, literally, &quot;I liked.&quot; / &quot;No.&quot;
:Q: Eu não tinha deixado aqui uma chave? A: Tinhas!
::Q: &quot;Didn&#x27;t I leave a key here?&quot; A: &quot;Yes, you did!&quot;, literally, &quot;[You] did.&quot;
:Q: Já leste este livro? A: Já. / Ainda não.
::Q: &quot;Have you already read this book?&quot; A: &quot;Yes&quot;, literally, &quot;Already.&quot; / &quot;Not yet.&quot;

The word &quot;sim&quot; (&quot;yes&quot;) may be used for a positive answer, but, if used alone, it may in certain cases sound unnatural or impolite. In Brazilian Portuguese, &quot;sim&quot; can be used &quot;after&quot; the verb for emphasis. In European Portuguese, emphasis in answers is added with the duplication of the verb. In both versions of Portuguese, emphasis can also result from syntactical processes that are not restricted to answers, such as the addition of adverbs like &quot;muito&quot; (&quot;much&quot;) or &quot;muitíssimo&quot; (&quot;very much&quot;).

It is also acceptable, though sometimes formal, to use &quot;yes&quot; before the verb of the question, separated by a pause or, in writing, a comma. The use of &quot;sim&quot; before the verb does &quot;not&quot; add emphasis, and may on the contrary be less assertive.

:Q: Gostou do filme? A: Gostei, sim!
::Q: &quot;Did you like the movie?&quot; A:&quot;Yes, I did!&quot; 
:Q: Gostaste do filme? A: Gostei, gostei!
::Q: &quot;Did you like the movie?&quot; A:&quot;I did, I did!&quot;
:Q: Há comboios a esta hora? A: Há, há!
::Q: &quot;Are there any trains at this time?&quot; A:&quot;Yes, there are!&quot; 
:Q: Ele gostou do filme? A: Sim, gostou...
::Q:&quot;Did he like the movie?&quot; A: &quot;He did, yes...&quot;

==Articles==

Portuguese has definite and indefinite articles, with different forms according to the gender and number of the noun to which they refer:

The noun after the indefinite article may be elided, in which case the article is equivalent to English &quot;one&quot; (if singular) or &quot;some&quot; (if plural): &quot;quero um também&quot; (&quot;I want one too&quot;), &quot;quero uns também&quot; (&quot;I want some too&quot;).

==Nouns==

Nouns are classified into two grammatical genders (&quot;masculine&quot; and &quot;feminine&quot;) and are inflected for grammatical number (singular or plural). Adjectives and determiners (articles, demonstratives, possessives, and quantifiers) must be inflected to agree with the noun in gender and number. Many nouns can take diminutive or augmentative suffixes to express size, endearment, or deprecation.

Portuguese does not inflect nouns to indicate their grammatical function or case, relying instead on the use of prepositions (simple and phrasal), on pleonastic objects, or on the context or word order. Personal pronouns, on the other hand, still maintain some vestiges of declension from the ancestor language, Latin.

===Gender and number===

Most adjectives and demonstratives, and all articles must be inflected according to the gender and number of the noun they reference:

:&quot;esta linda casa branca&quot; (&quot;this lovely white house&quot;)
:&quot;este lindo carro branco&quot; (&quot;this lovely white car&quot;)
:&quot;estas lindas aves brancas&quot; (&quot;these lovely white birds&quot;)
:&quot;estes lindos gatos brancos&quot; (&quot;these lovely white cats&quot;)

The agreement rules apply also to adjectives used with copulas, e.g. &quot;o carro é branco&quot; (&quot;the car is white&quot;) vs. &quot;a casa é branca&quot; (&quot;the house is white&quot;).

===Plural formation===

Portuguese nouns form their plurals by adding &quot;-s&quot; if the singular ends in a vowel, and &quot;-es&quot; if the singular ends in &quot;n&quot;, &quot;r&quot; or &quot;z&quot;. If the singular ends in &quot;s&quot;, then if the last syllable is stressed, the plural adds &quot;-es&quot;, and otherwise the plural is the same as the singular. Words ending in &quot;m&quot; change that &quot;m&quot; into &quot;ns&quot;, and words ending in &quot;l&quot; change that &quot;l &quot; into &quot;-is&quot; (e.g. &quot;animal&quot; &gt; &quot;animais&quot;). Before 1943, the plural of words that ended in &quot;l&quot;, was -es, so: Crystal -&gt; Crystaes, Papel -&gt; Papees. Words ending in &quot;ão&quot; vary in how they form their plurals: some replace the &quot;ão&quot; with &quot;ães&quot;, others with &quot;ões&quot;, and others just add an &quot;-s&quot; like the other nouns ending in a vowel.

====Gender determination====

Grammatical gender of inanimate entities is sometimes different from that used in sister languages: thus, for example, Portuguese &quot;árvore&quot; (&quot;tree&quot;) and &quot;flor&quot; (&quot;flower&quot;) are feminine, while Spanish &quot;árbol&quot; and Italian &quot;fiore&quot; are masculine; Portuguese &quot;mar&quot; (&quot;sea&quot;) and &quot;mapa&quot; (&quot;map&quot;) are masculine, while French &quot;mer&quot; and &quot;carte&quot; are feminine.

In many cases, the gender and number of a noun can be deduced from its ending: the basic pattern is &quot;&quot;-o&quot; / &quot;-os&quot; for masculine singular and plural, &quot;-a&quot; / &quot;-as&quot;&quot; for feminine. So, &quot;casa&quot; (&quot;house&quot;), &quot;mala&quot; (&quot;suitcase&quot;), &quot;pedra&quot; (&quot;stone&quot;), and &quot;inteligência&quot; (&quot;intelligence&quot;) are feminine, while &quot;carro&quot; (&quot;car&quot;), &quot;saco&quot; (&quot;bag&quot;), &quot;tijolo&quot; (&quot;brick&quot;), and &quot;aborrecimento&quot; (&quot;annoyance&quot;) are masculine. However, the complete rules are quite complex: for instance, nouns ending in &quot;-ção&quot; are usually feminine, except for augmentatives like &quot;bração&quot; (&quot;big arm&quot;). And there are many irregular exceptions. For words ending in other letters, there are few rules: &quot;flor&quot; (&quot;flower&quot;), &quot;gente&quot; (&quot;folk&quot;), &quot;nau&quot; (&quot;ship&quot;), &quot;maré&quot; (&quot;tide&quot;) are feminine, while &quot;amor&quot; (&quot;love&quot;), &quot;pente&quot; (&quot;comb&quot;), &quot;pau&quot; (&quot;stick&quot;), &quot;café&quot; (&quot;coffee&quot;) are masculine.

On the other hand, the gender of some nouns, as well as of first- and second-person pronouns, is determined semantically by the sex or gender of the referent: &quot;aquela estudante é nova, mas aquele estudante é velho&quot; (&quot;this (female) student is new, but that (male) student is old&quot;;
or &quot;eu sou brasileiro&quot; (&quot;I am Brazilian&quot;, said by a man) and &quot;eu sou brasileira&quot; (the same, said by a woman). Honorific forms of address such as &quot;Vossa Excelência&quot; (&quot;Your Excellency&quot;) exhibit noun/adjective agreement internally, but require agreement according to the gender of the referent for other modifiers, as in &quot;Vossa Excelência está atarefado&quot; (&quot;Your Excellency is busy&quot;).

Also, many animate masculine nouns have specific feminine derivative forms to indicate female sex or social gender: &quot;lobo&quot; (&quot;wolf&quot; or &quot;male wolf&quot;, masculine gender) → &quot;loba&quot; (&quot;she-wolf&quot;, feminine), &quot;conde&quot; (&quot;count&quot;, m.) → &quot;condessa&quot; (&quot;countess&quot;, f.), &quot;doutor&quot; (&quot;doctor&quot; or &quot;male doctor&quot;, m.) → &quot;doutora&quot; (&quot;female doctor&quot;, f.), &quot;ator&quot; (&quot;actor&quot;, m.) → &quot;atriz&quot; (&quot;actress&quot;, f.), etc. The feminine noun derivations should not be confused with the adjectival gender inflections, which use different (and more regular) rules.

===Diminutives and augmentatives===

The Portuguese language makes abundant use of diminutives, which connote small size, endearment or insignificance. Diminutives are very commonly used in informal language. On the other hand, most uses of diminutives are avoided in written and otherwise formal language.

The most common diminutive endings are &quot;-inho&quot; and &quot;-inha&quot;, replacing &quot;-o&quot; and &quot;-a&quot;, respectively. Words with the stress on the last syllable generally have &quot;-zinho&quot; or &quot;-zinha&quot; added, such as &quot;café&quot; &quot;coffee&quot; and &quot;cafezinho&quot; &quot;coffee served as a show of hospitality&quot;. In writing, a &quot;c&quot; (but not a &quot;ç&quot;) becomes &quot;qu&quot; in some words, like &quot;pouco&quot; (&quot;few&quot;) and &quot;pouquinho&quot; (&quot;very few&quot;), in order to preserve the [k] pronunciation.

Possible endings other than &quot;-inho(a)&quot; are:

-ito(a), &quot;e.g.&quot; copo/copito (&quot;glass&quot;)
-ico(a), &quot;e.g.&quot; burro/burrico (&quot;donkey&quot;)
-(z)ete, &quot;e.g.&quot; palácio/palacete (&quot;palace&quot;)

-ote, &quot;e.g.&quot; saia/saiote (&quot;skirt&quot;)
-oto, &quot;e.g.&quot; lebre/lebroto (&quot;hare/leveret&quot;)
-ejo, &quot;e.g.&quot; lugar/lugarejo (&quot;place&quot;)

-acho, &quot;e.g.&quot; rio/riacho (&quot;river&quot;)
-ola, &quot;e.g.&quot; aldeia/aldeola (&quot;village&quot;)
-el, &quot;e.g.&quot; corda/cordel (&quot;rope&quot;)

It is also possible to form a diminutive of a diminutive, e.g. &quot;burriquito&quot; (burro + -ico + -ito).

Portuguese diminutive endings are often used not only with nouns but also with adjectives, e.g. &quot;tonto/tontinho&quot; (&quot;silly&quot; / &quot;a bit silly&quot;), or &quot;verde/verdinho&quot; (&quot;green&quot; / &quot;nicely green&quot;) and occasionally with adverbs, e.g. &quot;depressa/depressinha&quot; (&quot;quickly&quot;) and some other word classes, e.g. &quot;obrigadinho&quot;—diminutive for the interjection &quot;obrigado&quot; &quot;thanks&quot;. Even the numeral &quot;um&quot; (one) can informally become &quot;unzinho&quot;.

The most common augmentatives are the masculine &quot;-ão&quot; and the feminine &quot;-ona&quot;, although there are others, like &quot;-aço(a)&quot; e.g. &quot;mulher/mulheraça&quot; (&quot;woman&quot;); or &quot;-eirão&quot;, e.g. &quot;voz/vozeirão&quot; (&quot;voice&quot;), less frequently used. Sometimes the masculine augmentative can be applied to a feminine noun, which then becomes grammatically masculine, but with a feminine meaning, e.g. &quot;a mulher / o mulherão&quot; (&quot;the woman&quot; / &quot;the big woman&quot;).

==Adjectives==

Adjectives normally follow the nouns that they modify. Thus &quot;white house&quot; is &quot;casa branca&quot;, and &quot;green fields&quot; is &quot;campos verdes&quot;; the reverse order (&quot;branca casa&quot;, &quot;verdes campos&quot;) is generally limited to poetic language.

However, some adjectives—such as &quot;bom&quot; (&quot;good&quot;), &quot;belo&quot; (&quot;nice&quot;), and &quot;grande&quot; (&quot;great&quot;, &quot;big&quot;)—often precede the noun. Indeed, some of these have rather different meanings depending on position: compare &quot;um grande homem&quot; &quot;a great man&quot;, vs. &quot;um homem grande&quot; &quot;a big man&quot;.

Adjectives are routinely inflected for gender and number, according to a few basic patterns, much like those for nouns, as in the following table:

A feminine adjective ending in &quot;-eia&quot; may correspond either to a masculine adjective ending in &quot;-eu&quot; (e.g. &quot;europeu, europeia&quot;) or to one ending in &quot;-eio&quot; (e.g. &quot;feio, feia&quot;).

Although, some adjectives are invariable, usually the ones whose singular form ending is &quot;-s&quot;, and a few colour adjectives, generally the compound ones, as in the table below:
 
The adjectives for &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; are irregular:

Comparison of adjectives is regularly expressed in analytic form using the adverb &quot;mais&quot;: &quot;mais alto (do) que&quot; = &quot;higher than&quot;, &quot;o mais alto&quot; &quot;the highest&quot;. Most adjectives have—in addition to their positive, comparative, and superlative forms—a so-called &quot;absolute superlative&quot; form (sometimes called &quot;elative&quot;), which enhances the meaning of the adjective without explicitly comparing it (&quot;lindo&quot;, &quot;beautiful&quot;; &quot;muito lindo&quot; or &quot;lindíssimo&quot;, &quot;very beautiful&quot;), it can appear in both analytic or synthetic form.
A few adjectives (besides &quot;mais&quot; itself) have suppletive comparative/superlative forms:

==Adverbs==

Portuguese adverbs work much like their English counterparts, e.g. &quot;muito&quot; (&quot;very&quot;), &quot;pouco&quot; (&quot;not much&quot;), &quot;longe&quot; (&quot;far&quot;), &quot;muito&quot; (&quot;much, a lot&quot;), &quot;quase&quot; (&quot;almost&quot;), etc. To form adverbs from adjectives, the adverbial suffix &quot;-mente&quot; is generally added to the feminine singular of the adjective, whether or not it differs from the masculine singular. Thus:

* &quot;claro&quot; (&quot;clear&quot;, m. sg.) → &quot;clara&quot; (f. sg.) → &quot;claramente&quot; (&quot;clearly&quot;)
* &quot;natural&quot; (&quot;natural&quot;, m. &amp; f. sg.) → &quot;naturalmente&quot; (&quot;naturally&quot;)

Unlike Spanish, an orthographic accent on the adjective is not retained on the adverb; thus for example &quot;rápido&quot; → &quot;rapidamente&quot; (&quot;fast, quickly&quot;).

As with adjectives, the comparative of adverbs is almost always formed by placing &quot;mais&quot; (&quot;more&quot;) or &quot;menos&quot; (&quot;less&quot;) before the adverb. Thus &quot;mais cedo&quot; (&quot;earlier&quot;), &quot;mais rapidamente&quot; (&quot;faster, more quickly&quot;), etc.

The adjectives &quot;bom&quot; (&quot;good&quot;) and &quot;mau&quot; (&quot;bad&quot;) have irregular adverbial forms: &quot;bem&quot; (&quot;well&quot;) and &quot;mal&quot; (&quot;badly&quot;), respectively. And, like their corresponding adjectival forms, &quot;bem&quot; and &quot;mal&quot; have irregular comparative forms: &quot;melhor&quot; (&quot;better&quot;) and &quot;pior&quot; (&quot;worse&quot;), respectively.

Adverbs of place show a three-way distinction between close to the speaker, close to the listener, and far from both:

:&quot;aqui&quot;, &quot;cá&quot; = &quot;here&quot;
:&quot;aí&quot;, &quot;lá&quot; = &quot;there&quot; (near you)
:&quot;ali&quot;, &quot;acolá&quot; = &quot;over there&quot; (far from both of us)

These adverbs (except by &quot;cá&quot; and &quot;lá&quot;) get contracted with &quot;de&quot; (from).

The English concept of phrasal verb—a verb-and-adverb sequence that forms a single semantic unit, such as &quot;set up&quot;, &quot;get by&quot;, &quot;pick out&quot;, etc.—is rare in Portuguese. There are, however, some exceptions, such as &quot;ir embora&quot; (&quot;to go away / to leave&quot;) and &quot;jogar fora&quot; (&quot;to throw away&quot;).

==Prepositions==

Simple prepositions consist of a single word, while compound prepositions are formed by a phrase.
The unprefixed &quot;pôr&quot; has the circumflex accent to distinguish it from the preposition &quot;por&quot;.

The &quot;-ar&quot; conjugation class is the largest of the three classes, and it is the only one open to neologisms, such as &quot;clicar&quot; (&quot;to click&quot; with a mouse).

Each conjugation class has its own distinctive set of some 50 inflectional suffixes: &quot;cant/ar&quot; → &quot;cant/ou&quot; (&quot;he sang&quot;), &quot;vend/er&quot; → &quot;vend/eu&quot; (&quot;he sold&quot;), &quot;part/ir&quot; → &quot;part/iu&quot; (&quot;he left&quot;). Some suffixes undergo various regular adjustments depending on the final consonant of the stem, either in pronunciation, in spelling, or in both. Some verbal inflections also entail a shift in syllable stress: &quot; &#x27;canto&quot; (&quot;I sing&quot;), &quot;can&#x27;tamos&quot; (&quot;we sing&quot;), &quot;canta&#x27;rei&quot; (&quot;I will sing&quot;). See Portuguese verb conjugation.

Verbs with some irregular inflections number in the hundreds, with a few dozen of them being in common use. Some of the most frequent verbs are among the most irregular, including the auxiliaries &quot;ser&quot; (&quot;to be&quot;), &quot;haver&quot; (&quot;there to be&quot; or &quot;to have&quot;), &quot;ter&quot; (&quot;to possess&quot;, &quot;to have&quot;, &quot;there to be&quot; – in Brazilian Portuguese), &quot;ir&quot; (&quot;to go&quot;).

===Gerund and participle forms===

The gerund form of a verb always ends with &quot;-ndo&quot;. It is used to make compound tenses expressing continuing action, e.g. &quot;ele está cantando&quot; (&quot;he is singing&quot;), &quot;ele estava cantando&quot; (&quot;he was singing&quot;); or as an adverb, e.g. &quot;ele trabalha cantando&quot; (&quot;he works while singing&quot;). It is never inflected for person or number.

In European Portuguese, the gerund is often replaced by the infinitive (preceded by &quot;a&quot;) when used to express continuing action.

The participle of regular verbs is used in compound verb tenses, as in &quot;ele havia cantado&quot; (&quot;he had sung&quot;). It can also be used as an adjective, and in this case it is inflected to agree with the noun&#x27;s gender and number: &quot;um hino cantado&quot; (&quot;a sung anthem&quot;, masculine singular), &quot;três árias cantadas&quot; (&quot;three sung arias&quot;, feminine plural). Some verbs have two distinct forms (one regular, one irregular) for these two uses. Additionally, a few verbs have two different verbal participles, a regular one for the active voice, and an irregular one for the passive voice. An example is the verb &quot;matar&quot; (to kill): &quot;Bruto havia matado César&quot; (&quot;Brutus had killed Cesar&quot;), &quot;César foi morto por Bruto&quot; (&quot;Cesar was killed by Brutus&quot;). Regular participle forms always end with &quot;-ado&quot;, for first conjugation verbs, or with &quot;-ido&quot;, for second and third conjugation verbs.

===Synthetic moods and tenses===

Grammarians usually classify the verbal inflections (i.e. the synthetic verb forms) into the following moods, tenses, and non-finite forms:
*indicative mood, used in the main clauses of declarative sentences:
**present tense: &quot;cantamos&quot;, &quot;we sing&quot;
**past tenses:
***preterite: &quot;cantámos&quot; (EP), &quot;cantamos&quot; (BP) &quot;we sang&quot;
***imperfect: &quot;cantávamos&quot;, &quot;we were singing&quot;
***pluperfect: &quot;cantáramos&quot;, &quot;we had sung&quot;
**future tense: &quot;cantaremos&quot;, &quot;we will sing&quot;
*conditional mood: 
**conditional tense: &quot;cantaríamos&quot;, &quot;we would sing&quot;
*subjunctive mood used in certain subordinate clauses:
**present subjunctive: &quot;que cantemos&quot;, &quot;that we sing&quot;
**preterite subjunctive: &quot;se cantássemos&quot;, &quot;if we sang&quot;
**future subjunctive: &quot;se cantarmos&quot;, &quot;if we sing/should we sing&quot;
*imperative mood: used to express a command, advice, encouragement, etc.:
**positive: &quot;canta!&quot; &quot;sing!&quot;
**negative: &quot;não cantes!&quot; &quot;don&#x27;t sing!&quot;
*verbals
**infinitives:
***impersonal: &quot;cantar&quot;, &quot;to sing&quot;
***personal: &quot;cantarmos&quot;, &quot;for us to sing&quot;, &quot;that we sing&quot; or &quot;our singing&quot;
**participles:
***present participle: &quot;cantando&quot; &quot;singing&quot;
***past (or passive) participle: &quot;cantado&quot; &quot;sung&quot;

The conditional tense is usually called &quot;future of the past&quot; in Brazilian grammars, whereas in Portugal it is usually classified as a separate &quot;conditional mood&quot;. Portuguese grammarians call subjunctive &quot;conjuntivo&quot;; Brazilians call it &quot;subjuntivo&quot;.

Note that the synthetic future and conditional have largely disappeared from everyday speech. The synthetic future is generally replaced by &quot;ir&quot; + infinitive (e.g. &quot;vou cantar&quot; &quot;I will sing&quot;), while the conditional is replaced either by the imperfect (especially in its modal use; &quot;se você me desse dinheiro, eu cantava&quot; &quot;if you gave me money, I would sing&quot;) or by the imperfect of &quot;ir&quot; + infinitive (in its non-modal, &quot;future of the past&quot; usage; &quot;ele disse que ia cantar&quot; &quot;he said that he would sing&quot;). However, the synthetic future subjunctive is still in common use (e.g. &quot;se você for&quot; &quot;if you should go&quot;). The synthetic future and conditional of verbs with one-syllable infinitives also sometimes occur (e.g. &quot;será/seria&quot; &quot;it will/would be&quot; or in the compound tenses &quot;terá/teria sido&quot; &quot;it will/would have been&quot;).

In regular verbs, the personal infinitive is identical to the subjunctive future tense; but they are different in irregular verbs: &quot;quando formos&quot; (&quot;when we go&quot;, subjunctive) versus &quot;é melhor irmos&quot; (&quot;it is better that we go&quot;).

There are also many compound tenses expressed with inflected forms of the auxiliary verbs &quot;ser&quot; and &quot;estar&quot; (variants of &quot;to be&quot;), &quot;haver&quot; and &quot;ter&quot; (variants of &quot;to have&quot;).

===Compound forms===

Portuguese has many compound verb tenses, consisting of an auxiliary verb (inflected in any of the above forms) combined with the gerund, participle or infinitive of the principal verb.

The basic auxiliary verbs of Portuguese are &quot;ter&quot;, &quot;haver&quot;, &quot;ser&quot;, &quot;estar&quot; and &quot;ir&quot;. Thus, for example, &quot;he had spoken&quot; can be translated as &quot;ele havia falado&quot; or &quot;ele tinha falado&quot;.

====Compound perfect====

Tenses with &quot;ter&quot;/&quot;haver&quot; + past participle (compound tenses):
* Preterite perfect indicative – &quot;temos falado&quot; (&quot;we have been speaking&quot;; see &quot;Preterite vs. present perfect&quot; below). &quot;Haver&quot; is not used nowadays. This tense may also be equivalent to the simple preterite for some fixed expressions, such as &quot;Tenho dito/concluído&quot;.
* Pluperfect indicative – &quot;tínhamos/havíamos falado&quot; (&quot;we had spoken&quot;)
* Anterior pluperfect indicative – &quot;tivéramos/houvéramos falado&quot; (&quot;we had spoken&quot;, literary use only)
* Future perfect indicative – &quot;teremos/haveremos falado&quot; (&quot;we will have spoken&quot;)
* Conditional perfect – &quot;teríamos/haveríamos falado&quot; (&quot;we would have spoken&quot;)
* Preterite perfect subjunctive – &quot;desde que tenhamos/hajamos falado&quot; (&quot;provided that we have spoken&quot;)
* Pluperfect subjunctive – &quot;se/que tivéssemos/houvéssemos falado&quot; (&quot;if/that we had spoken&quot;)
* Future perfect subjunctive – &quot;se/quando tivermos/houvermos falado&quot; (&quot;if/when we have spoken&quot;)
* Personal perfect infinitive – &quot;termos/havermos falado&quot; (&quot;for us to have spoken&quot;)
With no inflection:
* Impersonal perfect infinitive – &quot;ter/haver falado&quot; (&quot;to have spoken&quot;)
* Perfect gerund – &quot;tendo/havendo falado&quot; (&quot;having spoken&quot;)

====Compound vs. simple pluperfect====

In addition to the compound forms for completed past actions, Portuguese also retains a synthetic pluperfect: so, &quot;ele tinha falado&quot; and &quot;ele havia falado&quot; (&quot;he had spoken&quot;) can also be expressed as &quot;ele falara&quot;. However, the simple (one-word) pluperfect is losing ground to the compound forms. While pluperfect forms like &quot;falara&quot; are generally understood, their use is limited mostly to some regions of Portugal and to written language. In Brazil, they are used nearly exclusively in the printed language, though even in that environment the &quot;-ra&quot; synthetic pluperfect has been losing ground to the compound form using &quot;tinha&quot; in the last decades.

====Preterite vs. present perfect====

The simple past (or &quot;pretérito perfeito simples&quot; in Portuguese) is widely used, sometimes corresponding to the present perfect of English (this happens in many dialects of American Spanish, too).

A present perfect also exists (normally called &quot;pretérito perfeito composto&quot;), but it has a very restricted use, denoting an action or a series of actions which began in the past and are expected to continue into the future, but will stop soon. For instance, the meaning of &quot;Tenho tentado falar com ela&quot; may be closer to &quot;I have been trying to talk to her&quot; than to &quot;I have tried to talk to her&quot;, in some contexts.

====Progressive tenses====

Portuguese originally constructed progressive tenses with a conjugated form of the verb &quot;to be&quot;, followed by the gerund of the main verb, like English: e.g. &quot;Eu estou trabalhando&quot; &quot;I am working&quot; (cf. also the corresponding Italian phrase: &quot;(Io) sto lavorando&quot;). However, in European Portuguese an alternative construction has appeared, formed with the preposition &quot;a&quot; followed by the infinitive of the main verb: e.g. &quot;Eu estou a trabalhar&quot;. This has replaced the ancient syntax in central and northern Portugal. The gerund may also be replaced with &quot;a&quot; followed by the infinitive in less common verb phrases, such as &quot;Ele ficou lá, trabalhando&quot; / &quot;Ele ficou lá, a trabalhar&quot; &quot;He stayed there, working&quot;. However, the construction with the gerund is still found in southern and insular Portugal and in Portuguese literature, and it is the rule in Brazil.
:&quot;estou falando&quot; or &quot;estou a falar&quot; (&quot;I am speaking&quot;)
:&quot;estava falando/ a falar&quot; (imperfective: &quot;I was speaking&quot; [at the moment])
:&quot;estive falando/ a falar&quot; (perfective: &quot;I was speaking [for a while]&quot; / &quot;I have been speaking&quot; [for a while])
:&quot;estivera falando/ a falar&quot; (&quot;I had been speaking&quot;)
:&quot;estarei falando/ a falar&quot; (&quot;I will be speaking&quot;)
:&quot;esteja falando/ a falar&quot; (&quot;[that] I/he/she be speaking&quot;; or &quot;am&quot; or &quot;is speaking&quot;)
:&quot;se estivesse falando/ a falar&quot; (&quot;if I were speaking&quot;)
:&quot;quando estiver falando/ a falar&quot; (&quot;when you are speaking&quot; [in the future])
:&quot;estar falando/ a falar&quot; (&quot;to be speaking&quot;)

====Other compound tenses====

Tenses with &quot;ir&quot; + infinitive 
:&quot;vamos falar&quot; (&quot;we will speak&quot;, &quot;we are going to speak&quot;)
:&quot;íamos falar&quot; (&quot;we were going to speak&quot;)
:&quot;iríamos falar&quot; (&quot;we would speak&quot;, &quot;we would be going to speak&quot;)

In the spoken language, the construction &quot;ir&quot; + infinitive almost completely replaces the use of the synthetic future (e.g. &quot;vamos falar&quot; rather than &quot;falaremos&quot;).

Tenses with multiple auxiliaries:
:&quot;teríamos estado falando/a falar&quot; (&quot;we would have been speaking&quot;)
:&quot;tenho estado falando/a falar&quot; (&quot;I have been speaking [until now]&quot;)

===Passive voice===

An active clause with a transitive verb and direct object can be transformed into a passive clause much the same as is done in English: the original object becomes the subject; the verb is replaced by &quot;ser&quot; (in the same mood and tense) followed by the past participle of the original verb; and the original subject may become an adverbial complement with the preposition &quot;por&quot; (&quot;by&quot;):

:&quot;O rato comeu o queijo&quot; (&quot;The mouse ate the cheese&quot;)
:&quot;O queijo foi comido pelo rato&quot; (&quot;The cheese was eaten by the mouse&quot;)

:&quot;Aquela senhora cantará a ária&quot; (&quot;That lady will sing the aria&quot;)
:&quot;A ária será cantada por aquela senhora&quot; (&quot;The aria will be sung by that lady&quot;)

:&quot;Se você cantasse a ária, ele ficaria&quot; (&quot;If you were to sing the aria, he would stay&quot;)
:&quot;Se a ária fosse cantada por você, ele ficaria&quot; (&quot;If the aria were to be sung by you, he would stay&quot;)

As in Spanish, there is also—for third-person objects, and when the agent is not expressed—a &quot;reflexive&quot; passive, which uses the pronoun &quot;se&quot;:

:&quot;Fizeram-se planos e criaram-se esperanças.&quot; (&quot;Plans were made and hopes were created.&quot;)

The same construction extends to some intransitive verbs, in which case they are rendered &quot;impersonal&quot;, in the sense that their subject is not expressed:

:&quot;Comeu-se, bebeu-se e bailou-se.&quot; (&quot;There was eating, drinking, and dancing.&quot;)

===Subjunctive mood===
The Portuguese subjunctive mood is used mainly in certain kinds of subordinate clauses. There are three synthetic subjunctive inflections, conventionally called &quot;present&quot;, &quot;past&quot; and &quot;future&quot;. The rules of usage, in broad terms, are the following:
* The present subjunctive is used in clauses, often introduced with &quot;que&quot; (&quot;that&quot;), which express generally non-assertive notions, such as wishes, orders, possibilities, etc.:
::&quot;quero que cante&quot;, &quot;I want her/him to sing&quot;
::&quot;supondo que cante&quot;, &quot;assuming that he/she will sing&quot;
::&quot;ele será pago, cante ou não&quot;, &quot;he will be paid, whether he sings or not&quot;
*The past subjunctive is used for adverbial subordinate clauses, introduced with &quot;se&quot; (&quot;if&quot;) or equivalent, that are conditions for a main cause in the conditional tense. 
::&quot;se cantasse, seria famoso&quot; (&quot;if he/she sang [if he/she were a singer], he/she would be famous&quot;) 
::&quot;se cantasse, teríamos aplaudido&quot; (&quot;if he/she had sung, we would have applauded&quot;)
It is also used for noun clauses, introduced with &quot;que&quot;, that are the object of past wishes or commands:
::&quot;esperávamos que cantasse&quot; (&quot;we hoped that he would sing&quot;)
::&quot;eu mandei que cantassem&quot; (&quot;I ordered them to sing&quot;)
*The future subjunctive is an uncommon feature among Indo-European languages. It is used in adverbial subordinate clauses, usually introduced by &quot;se&quot; (&quot;if&quot;) or &quot;quando&quot; (&quot;when&quot;), or in adjectival subordinate clauses that express a neutral or expected condition for a present- or future-tense main clause:
::&quot;se cantarmos, seremos pagos&quot; (&quot;If we (should) sing, we will be paid&quot;)
::&quot;se cantarmos, ele fica&quot; (&quot;If we (should) sing, he stays&quot;)
::&quot;quando cantarmos, ele escutará&quot; (&quot;When we (should) sing, he will listen&quot;)
*Often, the option between indicative and subjunctive depends on whether the speaker does or does not endorse the proposition expressed by the subordinate clause:

::&quot;Admito que ele &quot;roubou&quot; a bicicleta.&quot; (&quot;I admit that he &quot;stole&quot; the bicycle.&quot;)
::&quot;Admito que ele &quot;possa ter roubado&quot; a bicicleta.&quot; (&quot;I admit that he &quot;could have stolen&quot; the bicycle.&quot;)
*In relative clauses, the option between indicative and subjunctive depends on whether the speaker does or does not identify a single object with the property expressed by the relative clause:

::&quot;Ando à procura de um cão que fala!&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m looking for a certain dog which can speak!&quot;)
::&quot;Ando à procura de um cão que fale!&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m looking for any dog that speaks!&quot;)

===Verbal derivatives===

Portuguese has many adjectives that consist of a verbal stem plus an ending in &quot;-nte&quot;, which are applied to nouns that perform the action of the verb; e.g. &quot;dançar&quot; (&quot;to dance&quot;) ~ &quot;areia dançante&quot; (&quot;dancing sand&quot;), &quot;ferver&quot; (&quot;to boil&quot;) ~ &quot;água fervente&quot; (&quot;boiling water&quot;).

However, those adjectives were not always derived from the corresponding Portuguese verbs. Most of them were directly derived from the accusatives of the present participles of Latin verbs, a form which was not retained by Portuguese. Thus, for example, Portuguese &quot;mutante&quot; (&quot;changing&quot;, &quot;varying&quot;) does not derive from the Portuguese verb &quot;mudar&quot; (&quot;to change&quot;), but directly from the Latin accusative present participle &quot;mutantem&quot; (&quot;changing&quot;). On the other hand, those pairs of words were eventually generalized by Portuguese speakers into a derivational rule, that is somewhat irregular and defective but still productive. So, for example, within the last 500 years we had the derivation &quot;pï&#x27;poka&quot; (Tupi for &quot;to pop the skin&quot;) → &quot;pipoca&quot; (Portuguese for &quot;popcorn&quot;) → &quot;pipocar&quot; (&quot;to pop up all over&quot;) → &quot;pipocante&quot; (&quot;popping up all over&quot;).

Similar processes resulted in many other semi-regular derivational rules that turn verbs into words of other classes, as in the following examples:
:&quot;clicar&quot; (&quot;to click&quot;) → &quot;clicável&quot; (&quot;clickable&quot;)
:&quot;vender&quot; (&quot;to sell&quot;) → &quot;vendedor&quot; (&quot;seller&quot;)
:&quot;encantar&quot; (&quot;to enchant&quot;) → &quot;encantamento&quot; (&quot;enchantment&quot;)
:&quot;destilar&quot; (&quot;to distill&quot;) → &quot;destilação&quot; (&quot;distillation&quot;)
The latter rule is quite productive, to the point that the pervasive &quot;-ção&quot; ending (derived from Latin &quot;-tione&quot;) is a visually striking feature of written Portuguese.

===Pronominal suffixes===

A specific feature of Portuguese, unusual among the Romance languages, is the placement of pronominal suffixes between the verb stem and the tense/person inflection in future and conditional verb forms. In Brazilian Portuguese it is limited to extremely formal and mostly written style. It has been losing ground in European Portuguese as well:

*&quot;Ela levá-lo-ia&quot; (&quot;She take-it-would&quot; – &quot;She would take it&quot;).
*&quot; dar-no-lo-ão&quot; (&quot;They give-us-it-will&quot; – &quot;They will give it to us&quot;).

<text>John Rogers SC (born 11 September 1947) is an Irish barrister who served as Attorney General of Ireland from 1984 to 1987.

He was educated at Rockwell College and Trinity College Dublin.

The Labour Party demanded the right to choose the Attorney General in the coalition government of 1984. At the time Mary Robinson was expected to be chosen; instead the nomination went to John Rogers, who had not yet been appointed a senior counsel (SC). Traditionally a new Attorney General would have practised as a senior counsel for a number of years prior to his or her appointment. Rogers was appointed an SC on the day he was made Attorney General of Ireland. He has worked as a senior counsel in the Law Library, Dublin, from 1987 to date. Rogers was banned from driving, for 2 years, in 1998 after being arrested for drink driving. He was more than twice over the legal limit.

<text>The Chronicles of Riddick is a 2004 American science fiction action film written and directed by David Twohy. It is a sequel to &quot;Pitch Black&quot; (2000) and the second installment in the &quot;Riddick&quot; film series. Vin Diesel reprises his role as Richard B. Riddick and acts as producer, alongside Thandiwe Newton (credited as Thandie), Karl Urban, Alexa Davalos, Colm Feore, and Keith David. It follows the adventures of Riddick as he attempts to elude capture and face an invading empire.

The film received negative reviews. It grossed $115.8 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film in the franchise but a financial disappointment. A sequel, titled &quot;Riddick&quot;, was released in 2013.

==Plot==

A crew of bounty hunters led by Toombs arrives at the frozen planet U.V. to hunt down Riddick, a notorious wanted fugitive. Riddick effortlessly kills Toombs&#x27; crew and forces Toombs to reveal the source of his intel: New Mecca on planet Helion Prime.

Commandeering Toombs&#x27; ship, Riddick heads to Helion Prime. He confronts Imam, whom he rescued five years earlier, and one of the few that knows of his hiding place. Imam tried to reach out to Riddick as he believes Helion Prime is the target of the Necromongers, religious fanatics crusading across the stars to absorb all human life into their ranks and kill the rest. Aereon, an Air Elemental, believes Riddick is a Furyan, a member of a race of warriors long thought extinct.

That night, massive Necromongers carriers unleashed countless ships upon Helion Prime and take control of the planet within hours. During the battle, Imam is killed, Aereon is captured, and Riddick sneaks onto a Necromonger ship.

As &quot;the Purifier,&quot; the Necromonger high priest, coerces the populace into converting, Riddick shows himself and kills the warrior who killed Imam. Intrigued, Lord Marshal, the Necromongers&#x27; leader, orders Riddick be scanned by the Quasi-Dead telepaths, who determine he is a Furyan survivor. A shocked Lord Marshal orders Riddick&#x27;s death, but he escapes only to be captured by Toombs. Toombs&#x27; new crew takes Riddick to Crematoria, a scorching subterranean prison moon.

Lord Marshal sends Commander Vaako to hunt down Riddick. Vaako&#x27;s wife speaks to Aereon, who reveals Lord Marshal devastated planet Furya after he was told a child from that planet would kill him. Dame Vaako and her husband determine Lord Marshal wants Riddick dead, as he may be the child of said prophecy.

On Crematoria, Riddick quickly asserts his position in the prison&#x27;s populace. He finds Jack, the girl he also rescued 5 years ago, now named Kyra, who resents him for abandoning her. Meanwhile, tension brews between Toombs and the prison warden, who knows this bounty has attracted the Necromongers to Crematoria. A firefight breaks out, killing most of the bounty hunters except for Toombs.

Overpowering and locking Toombs&#x27; in a cell, Riddick escapes the prison and leads several prisoners across Crematoria&#x27;s volcanic surface to the hangar to steal Toombs&#x27; ship. As the prisoners reach the outside of the hangar, they find that Necromonger ships have also landed. A three-way fight breaks out between the Necromongers, the prisoners, and the hangar guards. In the end, all of the guards and prisoners are killed, Riddick is incapacitated by Vaako, and Kyra is captured. As the deadly sunrise approaches, Vaako leaves Riddick to die and departs. He later reports Riddick dead and is promoted by the Lord Marshal.

The Purifier, who stays behind, drags Riddick to safety. He reveals that he too is a Furyan and, fighting his brain-washing, encourages Riddick to kill the Lord Marshal, then commits suicide by walking into the scorching sunlight.

Flying back to Helion Prime on Toombs&#x27;s ship, Riddick infiltrates the Necromongers&#x27; flagship. Dame Vaako sees him but encourages her husband to let Riddick fight Lord Marshal first, then kill the victor and take place as leader. Taking advantage of the Necromonger&#x27;s culture, Riddick openly challenges Lord Marshal, who taunts him by revealing Kyra has been converted. Riddick fights Lord Marshal, who keeps the upper hand with his supernatural powers. When Riddick&#x27;s life is at risk, Kyra stabs the Lord Marshal with a spear and gets knocked into a column of spikes. Vaako attempts to strike the wounded Lord Marshal, who evades the blow. However, Riddick intercepts and kills him. After Kyra dies in Riddick&#x27;s arms, the Necromongers, including Vaako, kneel before Riddick as their new leader.

==Production==
Universal Pictures decided to develop a sequel to &quot;Pitch Black&quot; after the success of &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot;, another action film that starred Vin Diesel. Diesel was offered $11 million to return for the sequel, a million dollars more than what he was offered for &quot;XXX&quot;. Universal hired David Hayter to come up with a script, which was later revised by Akiva Goldsman. However, Universal passed it up for a new draft from the first film&#x27;s director and writer, David Twohy.

According to Diesel, the film&#x27;s broader fantasy elements were introduced by him; the concept of Elementals came from &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, of which Diesel is a fan. Judi Dench was performing at Haymarket Theatre when Diesel made an offer for her to be in &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick&quot;. Dench said, &quot;Vin sent me a bouquet of flowers that were so big they couldn&#x27;t fit up the stairs to my dressing room. They could not get them into the corridor. Then he asked if I would be in his film. And of course I said yes. Why ever not?&quot; Filming took place in Vancouver, Canada.

==Release==
There are three versions of the film: the theatrical cut, which was PG-13; the director&#x27;s cut, which is unrated (both are available on DVD); and the third version, a mix of the two assembled for television viewing, which has some, but not all, of the added footage from the director&#x27;s cut. For instance, the minor subplot in the director&#x27;s cut of Riddick&#x27;s visions, as well as his moments with Toombs&#x27;s second in command, are both absent, but the ending from the director&#x27;s cut is present.

The &quot;unrated director&#x27;s cut&quot; DVD (featuring scenes which were cut in order to obtain a PG-13 rating) was released on November 16, 2004, and sold 1.5 million copies on the first day alone.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The production budget for &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick&quot; was reported to have been between $105 million and $120 million. The film grossed $57 million in North America, and its total worldwide gross stands between $107 million and $115 million.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 29% based on reviews from 167 critics and an average score of 4.60/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;As an action movie, &quot;Riddick&quot; offers some thrills, but as a sequel to &quot;Pitch Black&quot;, it&#x27;s a disappointment&quot;. Metacritic gives the film a score of 38 out of 100 based on reviews from 34 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

&quot;Slant Magazine&quot; gave the film 1.5 out of 4 and stated, &quot;Eschewing the claustrophobic minimalism of its predecessor &quot;Pitch Black&quot;, &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick&quot; is an extravagant orgy of used sci-fi parts.&quot; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a score of &#x27;C&#x27; and called it &quot;mostly a ponderous chronicle.&quot; Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; gave the film 1.5 out of 4 and criticized its pacing. Mick LaSalle of &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; gave the film 1 out of 4 and stated that it is &quot;an inane film rendered sometimes laughable by an atmosphere of dead-serious reverence.&quot; Ann Hornaday of &quot;Washington Post&quot; gave the film a negative review and stated that &quot;&quot;The Chronicles of Riddick&quot; doesn&#x27;t hark back merely to the classic horror or science fiction canon but to nearly every single cinematic genre in the book, from westerns to film noir to sword-and-sandal epics.&quot; Desson Thomson of &quot;Washington Post&quot; also gave the film a negative review and said that &quot;the muddy, convoluted story revolves around the star&#x27;s cool-guy poses and one-liners.&quot;

James Berardinelli of &quot;ReelViews&quot; gave the film 2.5 out of 4 and stated that &quot;although &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick&quot; offers its share of solidly entertaining moments, it doesn&#x27;t hold together as a single, coherent motion picture experience.&quot; Ty Burr of &quot;Boston Globe&quot; gave the film 2 out of 4 and called it &quot;a hodgepodge of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, and the more recent &quot;Star Wars&quot; films.&quot; Roger Ebert of &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 2 out of 4 and called it &quot;an exercise in computer-generated effects.&quot; Paul Clinton of &quot;CNN&quot; gave the film a negative review and called it &quot;a big, cheesy sci-fi flick tailor-made for a young male audience looking for things that go boom.&quot; BBC gave the film 2 out of 5 and praised Diesel&#x27;s &quot;imposing screen presence&quot;, but criticized its &quot;risible dialogue&quot;. &quot;Time Out&quot; also gave the film a negative review and stated, &quot;The sequel baton pass at the finale is pretty nifty, but it&#x27;s surely asking too much to think the filmmakers could leave us wanting more. Come to think of it, much, much less would have been best.&quot; Nell Minow of &quot;Common Sense Media&quot; gave the film 2 out of 5 and termed it a &quot;very violent, brainless explosion movie.&quot; &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; gave the film 3 out of 5 and called it a &quot;bloated, but enjoyable production.&quot;

=== Awards ===
For his performance in the film, Vin Diesel was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Actor at the 2004 Golden Raspberry Awards, but lost to George W. Bush for &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;.

== Spinoffs ==
The film spun off books, an action figure line, animation and video games.

=== Video game ===
The Xbox game &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay&quot; was released simultaneously with the film and was well-received. On April 7, 2009, a remake of the video game was included with the release of the game sequel &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena&quot;.

=== Short film ===
The animated short film &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury&quot; was released by &quot;Aeon Flux&quot; director Peter Chung.

<text>The Acura RL is a mid-size luxury car that was manufactured by the Acura division of Honda for the 1996–2012 model years over two generations. The RL was the flagship of the marque, having succeeded the Acura Legend, and was replaced in 2013 by the Acura RLX. All models of the Legend, RL and RLX lines have been adapted from the Japanese domestic market Honda Legend. The model name &quot;RL&quot; is an abbreviation for &quot;Refined Luxury.&quot;

The first-generation Acura RL was a rebadged version of the third-generation Honda Legend, and was first introduced to the North American market in 1996, to replace the second-generation Acura Legend. The second-generation Acura RL was a rebadged version of the fourth-generation Honda Legend, introduced to the North American market in September 2004, as a 2005 model. This iteration of the RL received an extensive mid-generational facelift for the 2009 model year, and a further update for 2011. The third-generation debuted for the 2014 model year as the [[Acura RLX]].

==First generation (1996–2004)==
===1996 (KA9)===
In 1996, Acura introduced the Acura 3.5RL, known internally as &quot;KA9,&quot; to replace the Legend. Acura dropped the Legend name when market research showed that consumers referred to Acura products by their model names, &quot;Legend&quot; and &quot;Integra,&quot; and did not necessarily associate the names with Honda&#x27;s &quot;Acura&quot; brand.

The 3.5RL&#x27;s longitudinally mounted V6 engine had its center-line mounted in-line with the car&#x27;s axis, and not transversely (i.e., 90 degrees offset from the vehicle axis) like most other front-wheel-drive cars. As a result, the longitudinal placement of the engine allowed for a smaller turning radius and easy in-town maneuverability, as well as 56/44 front/rear weight distribution for the 1996MY. Some of the engine&#x27;s internals such as the connecting rods and the crankshaft are forged. The connecting rods in particular are of note as they use a new process called &quot;block forging&quot;. The engine also employs a balance shaft in order to reduce NVH. A 4-speed automatic transmission equipped with Gradelogic is standard for all trim levels.The 3.5RL uses a double-wishbone front and multilink rear suspension. Both front and rear suspension uses coilsprings with progressive shock absorbers. Some bushings on this car are liquid filled in order to reduce harshness over bumps. This car uses speed-sensitive rack and pinion steering. Furthermore, some models were equipped with TCS also known as traction control. A powered moonroof is standard for all models. OE tire size was 215/60R16 mounted on 16x6.5&quot; rims. The body was finished in a 23 step, 5-coat, 4-bake paint process. An optional HDD based GPS navigation system was available in California for 1996. A cellular phone fitted in the center console was an optional extra.

=== 1998 ===
In 1998, the pre-facelift 3.5RLs received minor improvements. The Base and Premium trims received a new directional, spiral rim design. A one-year Special Edition trim level was offered which included two 2-tone paint schemes and unique 16x6.5&quot; 7-spoke alloy rims.
=== 1999 ===
In late 1998, the 1999 3.5RL received a front and rear facelift with integrated foglights, revised bumpers, hood, headlights, taillights, trunk, and fenders as well as driver and front passenger side-impact airbags. The suspension and chassis were stiffened, and new 8-spoke 16x7&quot; alloy wheels were fitted. HID low-beam headlights are now standard. Aerodynamics were improved as drag coefficient was reduced to 0.32 from 0.34 and lift coefficient was decreased to 0.102 from 0.155. The interior design changed somewhat, as some wood was removed from the dashboard. The steering wheel has changed in design with a floating horn switch instead of the 2 horn buttons on the 96-98&#x27; RLs. Homelink is now standard. The brakes were revised to be larger than pre-facelift models. Front and rear brake rotors are larger and thicker and new calipers are used to house bigger brake pads. New control arms were fitted to improve handling. 

=== 2000 ===
In 1999, a larger navigation system screen was added for the 2000 model year. Along with that larger screen came the conversion to easy-to-replace DVD map databases. The emissions systems were revised to allow the car to be granted &quot;LEV&quot; status. The TCS system was replaced with the VSA system. VSA is a electronic stability program that allows the car to mitigate under and oversteer using both the anti-lock braking system and TCS to improve stability in harsh cornering situations. 

=== 2001 ===
For the 2001 model year, the 3.5RL had child seat latches added to the rear deck, and a manual trunk release was added as well.

=== 2002 ===
In 2001, the 2002 model year 3.5RL received painted lower trim and mudflaps along with redesigned 7-spoke alloys and a newer, sportier suspension setup which included new springs, dampers, larger and solid sway bars, and new front upper control arms. A new dual-diaphragm master cylinder was fitted to allow for increased braking with reduced pedal force. The ABS was revised and is now 4 channel all the time. The OE tire size changed to 225/55R16. OE tires were the Michelin Pilot HX MXM4 rated at 94V. The revised engine produced and of torque due to a new variable-muffler. More insulation was added in the engine compartment for 2002. OnStar is now standard for the 2002 model year. The Onstar antenna is mounted on the roof. Service was terminated in 2008 with the discontinuation of the 1G AMPS service in the U.S. 

=== 2003 ===
For 2003, RLs received clear turn signal lenses in the rear lights, a new 10-spoke alloy wheel design, larger emblems, and various interior upgrades including new wood staining and a new interior color scheme. 

=== 2004 ===
For the 2004 model year, the 3.5RL offered as standard equipment a revised navigation system and integrated satellite radio in the Continental United States in addition to a redesigned center console and chrome door lock pulls. The 2004 3.5RL was the first production saloon car to offer satellite radio as standard equipment. As a result, the antenna design was revised to include a body-colored base for the XM radio. The Bose audio system saw 2 new tweeters added next to the 6.5&quot; speakers in the front door. The 6-Disc CD changer is now in the dash instead of in the trunk like previous years. As a result, the climate control system was revised to have the controls integrated with the navigation system instead of analog dials and buttons like on previous years. The amplifier was revised to accommodate the new tweeters. New gauges were fitted for the 2004 model year. A new, thicker steering wheel was fitted for the 2004MY as well as a new steering wheel airbag. In the lower 48 there was only one available factory trim level. The only options available were dealer options.

The 1996–2004 3.5RL&#x27;s engine was the last in the Acura lineup not to use Honda&#x27;s variable valve timing system (VTEC), This 3.5 L 90-degree V6 engine was internally designated as the C35A, and was the last of the Honda C engine V6 engines used in Honda and Acura lineups, being replaced by the newer Honda J engine 60-degree V6 engines. The 2004 RL was also the last Acura to use the numeric designation (i.e., 3.5) for its engine displacement.

==Second generation (2005–2012)==
===2005 (KB1)===

The new-generation car, known internally as &quot;KB1,&quot; was launched in late 2004 for the 2005 model year. Without the rumored V8 engine, it featured an all-wheel drive system marketed by Acura as &quot;Super Handling-All Wheel Drive&quot; (SH-AWD). It integrated active differentials with the all-wheel-drive system and traction control to improve handling, similar to the &quot;ATTS&quot; system featured on the 1997 Honda Prelude &quot;SH&quot;. At the time of its introduction, the Acura RL&#x27;s SH-AWD was the first all-wheel-drive system to vary the distribution of power not only from front to back, but also side to side in the rear using a technique called torque vectoring. The RL can direct up to 70% of available torque to the rear wheels, and up to 100% of that available rear torque can be directed to just one wheel. In combination with a specially designed planetary gear-set which can over-drive the rear wheels at up to five percent greater speed than the front wheels, the torque directed to one wheel, or torque vectoring, can have a steering effect. As the car speeds around a curve, torque vectored to the outside rear wheel will push the rear end around the curve faster, just as paddling the outside oar of a row boat faster than the inside oar will cause the row boat to turn, to minimize the understeer common in front-heavy vehicles.

The first-generation RL had been powered by the 90-degree C-series non-VTEC V6 engine. The second-generation RL used a newer design 60-degree J-series 3.5 L V6 SOHC VTEC engine delivering , (later revised to due to amended SAE testing procedures). To give the car a more sporty feel, the car featured drive-by-wire throttle control and a five-speed sequential sport shifting automatic transmission with shift paddles mounted on the steering wheel. As with the first-generation Acura RL, the second-generation Acura RL required premium unleaded fuel rated at 91 (R+M)/2 octane.

A first for the RL was the use of aluminum four-piston front brake calipers over 12.6-inch cast-iron ventilated front rotors. These multi-piston calipers, derived from racing applications, are extremely rigid. In the rear, 12.2-inch cast-iron ventilated discs attached to their hub with lightweight aluminum collets were gripped by one-piston aluminum brake calipers. The RL was equipped with unique five-spoke 17-inch alloy wheels and Michelin Pilot HX MXM4 245/50R17 98V all season grand touring tires. 

New features on the 2005 RL included a keyless entry system that allowed the driver to both lock and unlock the car by touching the door handle without having to use the remote control, and a keyless start system. A new 260 watt, ten speaker Bose DVD-Audio 5.1 sound system equalized for the RL cabin featured several Bose technologies. Bose AudioPilot is a noise compensation technology which analyzes background environmental cabin noise and uses an algorithm based on cabin acoustics to boost certain portions of the musical signal so that it may be heard more clearly above environmental sound &quot;clutter&quot; without any apparent change in volume. Bose Centerpoint processes stereo and matrix surround sound recordings to allow play through the 5.1 sound system even though the source may only be a stereo sound track. Bose Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) rounded out the suite. The ANC was always on, whether the stereo was on or not. The ANC took input from two microphones placed in the cabin to analyze drivetrain-related low-frequency sound waves entering the cabin. The ANC sent information to the sound system to create a precisely shaped and timed reverse-phased audio signal from the door speakers and the subwoofer. The result was a dramatic reduction in perceived engine and exhaust noise.

XM Satellite Radio, integrated Bluetooth hands-free technology for wireless phone use, voice recognition technology with over 560 voice commands to control navigation system and displays, wireless phone, audio system, heating and ventilation controls rounded out the cabin&#x27;s technological features. Heating and air conditioning systems were tied into a solar sensor and GPS positioning so that cabin temperature remained constant in a mixed sun and shade situation. Based on sun position and cabin orientation, the system could automatically send additional cooling air to the sunny side of the car to keep that occupant comfortable, while not freezing out the occupant on the shady side.

The Alpine Electronics DVD-based navigation system was integrated with an 8-inch LCD display and a multi-use Interface Dial, which could move up, down, left and right like a mouse, turn like a knob, scroll through preset menus, and click when pushed to act as a selector button. Unlike many in-car navigation systems, the Alpine DVD-based navigation unit allowed the driver to change destinations and routes &quot;on the fly&quot; while driving, rather than being locked out unless the car was in Park. The tightly integrated voice recognition system worked with the navigation system and could recognize spoken city and street names. Also unique at the time was two-way communication via AcuraLink satellite communication. Using a facility of XM Radio service, the system could send a variety of messages to the car, including service appointment reminders (appointments first made via Internet) or important messages such as recall notices. The use of OnStar was carried over from the previous generation RL. Use of digital/analog trimode (two digital bands and one analog band) technology allowed the 2005 RL OnStar technology to survive the planned 2007 phase-out of the analog OnStar to fully digital OnStar service.

Other new RL features included the Active Front Lighting System, in which the high intensity discharge headlamps swiveled in concert with the steering up to twenty degrees, for improved night cornering vision. Light emitting diodes (LED) replaced traditional incandescent bulbs in the tail and brake lights, the turn signals integrated in the side mirror housings, and many interior cabin lights.
The 2005 RL was also the first Honda vehicle to use the &quot;Advanced Compatibility Engineering&quot; (ACE) body structure, which has since proliferated throughout every newly introduced Honda and Acura vehicle design. The ACE structure features extensive use of high-tensile steel and lightweight aluminum components in a front-mounted polygonal main frame, designed to engage vehicles of differing size and weight in a frontal collision and spread the forces through multiple structural pathways, while preventing or minimizing cabin deformation. In practical terms, this means in an SUV versus ACE structure car collision, there is a greater chance that the ACE body structure will engage with the SUV&#x27;s frame and dissipate collision forces around the passenger compartment. In more conventional non-ACE car structures, the SUV frame has a much greater chance of missing or over-riding the conventional car&#x27;s major structural components and a greater chance of deforming the passenger compartment.

The 2005 RL car structure used aluminum alloy in the hood, front fenders, trunk lid and frame, front and rear subframes, suspension arms, front knuckles and bumper beams. Magnesium was used in the intake manifold, and the two-piece center drive shaft was made of a carbon reinforced composite. The new RL featured extensive aerodynamic design treatment including details such as flush side glass, plus underbody covers and diffusers to reduce lift, resulting in a very low drag coefficient of 0.29.

=== 2006 ===
For 2006, the Acura RL was also offered in a second trim level, the optional &#x27;Technology Package&#x27; which included three new features: adaptive cruise control (ACC), Collision Mitigation Braking System, and Michelin PAX System run-flat tires on unique PAX 235 mm x 460 mm A (&quot;A&quot; for asymmetric) aluminum alloy wheels with unique 245-680R460A Michelin Pilot HX MXM4 all-season Grand Touring type radials designed for the Michelin PAX System. The metric sized, run-flat Michelin PAX System wheels and tires are equivalent to wheels and 245/45-R18 conventional tires. The previously standard color-matched mud guards were removed in 2006. All 2006 models had a slight change to the navigation system that allowed the installation of an optional rearview camera. MSRP increased by $200 over the equivalent 2005 model.

=== 2007 ===
For 2007, the Acura RL was offered in three trim levels: a &quot;standard&quot; or &quot;base&quot; package; a newly defined &quot;Technology Package;&quot; and the highest level trim, the &quot;Technology Package with CMBS/PAX.&quot;

Base model cars were well equipped, but deleted certain features such as the navigation system and Adaptive Front Lighting System (AFS), and substituted plastic simulated wood for the dashboard maple wood trim.

Technology Package cars were essentially the same as the 2005 and 2006 standard models, coming with navigation and AFS, while adding as standard equipment a rear backup camera and a 3.5 mm stereo input jack for Apple iPod and other MP3-type devices.

The Technology Package plus CMBS/PAX trim level had no 2005 equivalent, though it was most similar to the 2006 Technology Package that had also included ACC/CMBS and PAX technologies. While the label &quot;CMBS/PAX&quot; might appear to indicate ACC was dropped as a feature, in reality, ACC was an extension of the CMBS system, and so was included.

As noted above, the MP3 audio player feature (usable for any device with a 3.5 mm headphone jack) was added to all trim levels. An integrated rearview camera was added to the top two trim levels. An integrated rearview camera could be added to the non-navigation Base model as a dealer installed option. The Base model optional rearview camera was installed in the same manner and position as on the 2006 models, mounted dead center in the trunk trim, with the trunk release button displaced to the right of center (passenger side). The difference was subtle, but the factory rearview camera installation on the Technology Package and the Technology Package with CMBS/PAX is to the left side (driver&#x27;s side) of the center-mounted trunk release.

In 2005 and 2006, all models came standard with &quot;genuine curly maple wood dashboard trim.&quot; With the introduction of three trim levels, the genuine curly maple wood dashboard trim now only appeared on the two higher level cars: the Technology Package and the Technology Package with CMBS/PAX. OnStar was deleted as a feature from all trim levels. Colors were added and deleted. MSRP increased by $100 from the roughly equivalent 2006 trims.

=== 2008 ===
The 2008 Acura RL continued unchanged in the U.S. market from the 2007 model, with three trim levels. Colors were added and deleted. MSRP increased $500 for each trim:

In Canada, the 2008 Acura RL was available in two different models, Base and Elite Package. The Elite Package added Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS), Active Front Lighting System (AFS), Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), heated and cooled ventilated front seats, and burled maple wood trim.

===2005–2008 A-Spec Performance Package===

For the 2005–2008 models, Acura offered an A-Spec package for the RL. The dealer-installed package consisted of a body kit, badging, revised suspension and different wheels. The package was first announced at a late 2004 Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) trade show in Las Vegas. The A-Spec package for sale was distinctly different from the Acura RL A-Spec Concept Vehicle announced and shown as a striking dark red one-of-a-kind custom creation in early 2005 at the Detroit Auto Show.

The performance part of the package included the A-Spec sport suspension and A-Spec 18-inch alloy wheels, which allowed the use of more sports-oriented lower profile tires.

The A-Spec sport suspension changed out the four spring and damper (shock absorber) strut assemblies. The A-Spec suspension featured lowering springs (approximately 0.75 inch) and re-valved dampers. The ride was stiffer, but not overly so, and handling was improved with less body roll, more controlled cornering and enhanced feel. Reportedly Acura chose to make the RL&#x27;s A-Spec suspension more compliant than the very stiff A-Spec sport suspension upgrade for the Acura TL, in keeping with the two different missions of the cars: luxury for the RL, luxury sport for the TL. Acura RL A-Spec retained the same suspension geometry as the stock Acura RL suspension alignment specifications.

The other A-Spec performance upgrade was a set of A-Spec 18x8 inch alloy wheels. The 10-spoke lightweight design was about the same weight as the 5-spoke, 17x8&quot; standard wheels. Recommended tires were either the Michelin Pilot Sport PS2 ultra high-performance summer tires or Michelin Pilot Sport A/S ultra-high-performance all-season tires sized in 245/45R18. Alternatively, less sport-oriented Michelin Pilot HX MXM4 Grand Touring All Season tires were also available in the same size.

The A-Spec appearance package consisted of a front air dam, side skirts, rear bumper air diffuser, an &quot;A-Spec&quot; badge on the trunk lid, and a subtle trunk decklid lip style spoiler all of which were designed to give the car a more aggressive &quot;aero&quot; look. The parts came pre-painted from the factory to match factory colors. All parts were dealer installable. If the dealer installed the A-Spec parts at the time of purchase, the original new car warranty of four years/50,000 miles would apply. If installed after purchase, the normal one year/12,000 mile parts warranty would apply.

As of the 2009 mid-model change, A-Spec options were no longer offered. However, Acura moved to a firmer standard suspension for 2009, plus larger and wider inch standard wheels and lower-profile 245/45-18 size tires. More aggressive &quot;aero&quot; look body work was also standard, and a revised trunk decklid spoiler was made available as a dealer installed option.

===2009 mid-model change (KB2)===
For the 2009 model year, the RL received an extensive mid-model change (MMC), and made its introduction at the Chicago Auto Show on February 6, 2008, marketed by Acura as &quot;the most extensive Acura MMC ever&quot;. The new sedan was designated KB2 in the VIN codes, differentiating it from the 2005–2008 KB1 chassis VIN code. The revised sedan was released on July 1, 2008, to dealerships. The engine is upgraded to 3.7 liters with . While on paper, the engine may seem to be the same unit as shared with the Acura MDX, it is actually a variant that introduces, for the first time ever on an SOHC Honda V6, an implementation of the Honda VTEC variable valve train technology on both intake and exhaust for improved horsepower and torque. Heretofore, all previous SOHC Honda V6 engines with VTEC used the technology on the intake side only. Engine emissions were reduced to meet the stricter U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) TIER 2 – BIN 5 and California Air Resources Board ULEV-2 standards. Implementation of the SH-AWD was adjusted for earlier intervention and a greater rear-wheel bias for better handling dynamics.

The MMC RL suspension was upgraded with higher-rate coil springs, larger diameter anti-sway bars and stiffer bushings all around. The MMC RL was equipped with a new larger front anti-sway bar of hollow construction, 30mm diameter overall with a 6.5mm wall thickness, and a larger rear solid anti-sway bar, 19mm in diameter. The pre-MMC models sported a solid 29mm front and 17mm rear sway bar.

Standard 18- x 8-inch seven-spoke alloy wheels with 245/45-18 tires replaced the previous years&#x27; 17- x 8-inch five-spoke offerings for not only the Base and Tech package models, but also for the highest trim level, the ACC/CMBS equipped model. Previous years&#x27; ACC/CMBS equipped models were equipped with [Michelin PAX System] run-flat tires on 18-inch equivalent (460 mm diameter) five-spoke wheels.

Inside, the front seats were revised for greater comfort and to allow a slight increase in rear leg room. The passenger front seat received the same full 10-way power control as the driver&#x27;s seat. Both front seats featured active head restraint systems, and the existing seat-heating feature was supplemented by six levels of cooling ventilation. Controls for heating and air conditioning were simplified, and additional individual vent controls were added for the driver and passenger. The shift gear no longer had a gated sequence, but moved straight fore and aft like the ones in the Acura TSX and Acura TL. Simulated woodgrain trim was added to the steering wheel and the top of the shifter, to emphasize the RL&#x27;s upscale aspirations compared to its less costly TL and TSX siblings.

Additional insulation, improved acoustic isolation, windshield design, and a new implementation of the Active Noise Cancellation system (ANC) combined to make the 2009 RL&#x27;s interior quieter in a variety of conditions. Whereas the former ANC was set to cancel out only low frequency noises from the engine and exhaust, the MMC system, called Active Sound Control, was expanded in its range to cancel some higher frequency road and tire noise. Unlike its predecessor ANC, Active Sound Control was now linked to throttle position and engine RPM to provide a quieter cockpit during normal cruising, yet allowed more of the new 3.7 L engine&#x27;s &quot;muscular sound&quot; to be heard at higher engine speeds and higher velocities.

An additional microphone as well as some switchable directionality was added to the HFL (Hands Free Link) and Voice Activated Navigation and Convenience controls. When the system was in &quot;accept commands&quot; mode, the new microphone system provided more accurate system &quot;understanding&quot; of the driver&#x27;s voice. Extraneous sounds, such as other voices in the cabin and wind noise, were better distinguished and filtered out by the dual microphone system. Directionality was removed when an HFL voice call was established, so that all passengers could still participate in a phone call as in the pre-MMC model. The number of voice recognition commands was increased to over 700, up from 560 previously.

The DVD-based navigation system improved on previous XM satellite-linked traffic flow reporting, adding continuously updated real-time weather reporting and the capability to reroute based on current traffic conditions. The DVD Audio-capable 10-speaker sound system remained, but integration with the audio system was improved with the addition of Bluetooth stereo and a USB port that allowed integration and operation of Apple iPod and other MP3 type devices. Also new was the ability to display iPod or other MP3 device (such as a USB flash memory device) folder and playlist information on the car&#x27;s 8-inch central navigation display screen.

New shifter and center console arrangements were added, including a Sport mode. The steering wheel paddle shifters were reprogrammed for faster response, and the paddle shifters could be operated in both Drive and Sport modes. In pre-MMC models, the gear selector had to be put in manual mode for the paddle shifters to operate.

In exterior length, the 2009 RL grew slightly by . The height grew by a scant , while the width, track and wheelbase remained the same. The front end including the hood, and the rear including the trunkline, were revised, and the headlights and taillights redesigned. One of the poorly received features of the 2009 RL was its revised grille design, marketed as the &quot;Power Plenum,&quot; the first of three similar designs that was soon joined by the second-generation 2009 Acura TSX and the fourth-generation 2009 Acura TL.

Curb weights increased for 2009. The MMC Base weighed in at 4083lbs, the Technology Package model 4085lbs, and the ACC/CMBS with no PAX weighed 4110. The equivalent 2006 pre-MMC Technology Package had weighed 4012lbs, and the pre-MMC with ACC/CMBS/PAX weighed 4074lbs.

MSRP for the 2009 Acura RL increased by $500 over 2008 model for each of its three trim levels. For 2009, the Michelin PAX Run Flat Tire system was no longer offered in combination with the CMBS/ACC package. ACC was now featured alongside CMBS as part of the package name, after a two-year hiatus. In reality, ACC was always included as a part of the CMBS. Colors were also added and deleted.

The 2010 Acura RL continued with few changes in the U.S. from the 2009 model, as indicated on the Acura.com website for the RL. Colors were added and deleted once again, and MSRP increased $150 in each trim:

=== 2011 update ===

The 2011 Acura RL added new color combinations, an all new six-speed automatic transmission, power folding mirrors, and rear backup/parking sensors.

The six-speed automatic transmission, first introduced on the 2010 Acura ZDX, finally replaced the RL&#x27;s five-speed automatic, long criticized by the press as outdated. The transmission upgrade was credited for an EPA gas mileage improvement to city, highway, and combined, an increase of 2 miles per U.S. gallon in highway driving. In addition, 0-60 times were said to decrease by 0.5 seconds, to 6.0 seconds. There have been reports that the 2009 Acura RL Mid Model Change was originally the introduction candidate for the six-speed feature within the Acura lineup, but that the transmission was still undergoing testing and was not yet ready at that time.

Power folding mirrors had been available in markets other than North America since the 2004 introduction in Japan. Parking/backup sensors had been available in the North American market as a dealer installed option since the second generation Acura RL&#x27;s introduction in late 2004. A host of other features had also been available since the car&#x27;s introduction in late 2004, some of which are detailed in the Safety section below.

The RL exterior was updated for 2011 with a toned-down version of the controversial &quot;power plenum&quot; front grille. Inside, the RL offered a new interior color (Sea Coast), new Dark Burlwood interior trim, and thin-thread stitching on the steering wheel.

Unique new diameter 15-spoke aluminum wheels included a new noise quieting technology: a polypropylene &quot;Helmholtz resonator&quot; that encircled the center portion of the inside of the wheel. The resonator served to suppress specific frequencies between 100 and 500 hertz, and in combination with increased floorboard insulation, decreased interior noise by 1.3 dB, or 15%. The Helmholtz resonators in the wheels were touted as a &quot;world&#x27;s first&quot; for a passenger vehicle. The new wheels appeared to be conventional alloy wheels modified to incorporate an internal noise reduction device. A diagram showed an elastomer-type ring with multiple hollow chambers surrounding the center line of the wheel circumference. This resonator was designed to absorb the resonances generated by rough road surfaces such as highway seams.

=== 2012 ===

The 2012 Acura RL appears to be a carryover from the 2011 refresh with no substantive changes. Price increases US$1,000. The color Platinum Frost Metallic had been dropped in 2011, but appears to be added back in 2012.

===Reception===
The second-generation 2005 Acura RL appeared on &quot;Car and Driver&quot;&#x27;s Ten Best list for 2005. The car also garnered a CNET.com &quot;Editor&#x27;s Choice&quot; Award for Top Tech Car and has had been reviewed in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, and 2011 as well as 2013 for its successor, the RLX. The SH-AWD all-wheel-drive system was lauded by &quot;Popular Science&quot; as one of the best automotive innovations of 2004, and earned the 2005 &quot;Tech Car of the Year&quot; from CNET.com. In a comparison of 2006–2007 model year mid-luxury sedans with all-wheel drive (prices ranging from $60,000 to 65,000 CAD), the RL compared favorably to a Mercedes-Benz E300 4MATIC and a BMW 528xi with xDrive. Subsequent moves by both Audi and BMW to design and market their own versions of torque vectoring all-wheel-drive systems bear out the innovative nature of the SH-AWD design.

While critically acclaimed, sales did not meet expectations. Despite the mid-generational update in 2009, only 2,043 cars were sold in the U.S., a 55 percent drop from 2008. Among Japanese luxury flagships marketed in America during the first six months of 2010, Acura sold only 872 RLs, compared to 5,650 Lexus LS and 6,602 Infiniti M sedans. Only 379 RLs were sold in North America in 2012.

Enthusiasts and dealers said that the RL was not competitive because it lacked the full-size dimensions (the back seat was regarded as tight for a car of this size), a V8 engine performance option, and the better handling and balanced rear-wheel drive of its larger rivals in the mid-luxury segment. The 2009 refresh and 2011 update did not keep the RL competitive enough in acceleration or fuel economy, considering that other marques had released new generations of their mid-size luxury sedans, and as the 2009-10 RL retained a five-speed automatic transmission while other rivals had automatics with six or seven gears. Other competitors that were midway through their model cycle, such as the 2004-07 BMW 530i and 2005–08 Audi A6 3.2 FSI (with naturally-aspirated 6-cylinder engines that were less powerful than the Acura RL&#x27;s 3.5L V6) received updated engines with turbocharging/supercharging; the resulting 2008 BMW 535i and 2009 Audi A6 3.0 TFSI proved more powerful and fuel-efficient than the 2009 Acura RL (with a 3.7L V6). The RL&#x27;s styling, while generally considered handsome, was not viewed as inspiring or passionate enough to alert buyers to its technological features or stand out in a crowded field, and the 2009 model was criticized for its &quot;power plenum&quot; grille, a bright horizontal pentagon of chrome that formed a shield across the upper center.

Some have suggested that the Acura RL&#x27;s failure in the market was due to its initial pricing which was perceived to be out of its bracket. Honda Japan believed that the new RL offered more features and performance than the base version of its luxury competitors (i.e., the base six-cylinder BMW 5 Series), and suggested that it could charge more, though Honda Canada disagreed. The RL&#x27;s initial MRSP was $69,500 CAD, considerably more than the six-cylinder BMW 525i and close to that of the V8-powered 2005 BMW 545i at $70,000 CAD. At the RL&#x27;s price point, most consumers expected a V8. Furthermore, they did not perceive the Acura brand as being on par with its German rivals (Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz) and expected more value from the Japanese marque, particularly with Acura&#x27;s more expensive offerings (as opposed to entry-level offerings like the Acura TL which were much more successful in their price brackets). The damage from Honda Japan&#x27;s alleged hubris was done, perhaps giving the RL an unfavorable image that could not be removed, even though Honda Canada has since reduced the RL&#x27;s price as well as releasing a decontented trim to hit a lower price point. Although other Japanese manufacturers have had limited success in the mid-luxury market which has been dominated by the Germans, the Lexus GS 350 and Infiniti M35 (which debuted around the same time as the second-generation Acura RL) sold considerably better than the Acura RL as they followed a strategy of undercutting the German executive cars with lower pricing and/or more standard features. Late in its production lifespan the RL also faced competition from the Hyundai Genesis which was less expensive yet similarly refined, while featuring rear wheel drive and an optional V8 engine.

In 2009, the new generation of the Acura TL was released. The TL&#x27;s high performance trim features essentially the same engine (but slightly more horsepower, so Acura advertised the TL as its most powerful car), the SH-AWD system, similar dimensions, and many of the RL&#x27;s other key features for only $44,900 CAD, causing some to question whether it rendered the costlier RL superfluous in Acura&#x27;s own showrooms. An auto journalist remarked of the RL&#x27;s successor, the Acura RLX, saying &quot;Making the RLX bigger fixes nothing. The RL&#x27;s problem, and now the RLX&#x27;s, is that the car looks and feels like an exalted, compulsively over-equipped Honda Accord&quot;.

===Safety===
In October 2010, the Acura RL was named by &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; as the most reliable new car among luxury sedans, one of five Honda models so honored in their respective categories. The others were the front-wheel-drive version of the Acura TL among upscale sedans, the Honda CR-V small SUV, the Acura RDX small upscale SUV, and the Honda Ridgeline compact pickup truck.

From 2005 to 2008, Acura RL has been ranked #1 and has achieved the best car safety score (46.4) in Informed for LIFE&#x27;s &quot;2003–2009 Vehicle risk index SCOREs&quot;. For both the 2009 and 2010 model years, the Acura RL received a five-star crash safety ratings from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). For the 2009 model year, the Acura RL received a Top Safety Pick designation from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) earning a &quot;Good&quot; — the highest score possible — on frontal offset, side impact and rear crash protection tests. The &quot;Good&quot; scores continued for all tests conducted on the 2010 model. When a roof strength (rollover) evaluation was added to the battery of tests, the RL was rated only &quot;Marginal&quot; in this category, causing it to lose the Top Safety Pick award.

* The Acura RL consistently garnered National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Five Star (the highest rating) ratings for Frontal, Side and Rollover crash testing. The injury measures on the driver in the front test were some of the lowest ever recorded in a NHTSA test at the time, and were still considered top notch as of 2010.
* The Acura RL consistently earned a green G for &quot;Good&quot; (the highest rating) in Frontal Offset and Side Impact tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS).
* The facelifted 2009 Acura RL has revised head restraints, thus improving the rear crash protection rating for the 2005–2008 models from Marginal to Good for the 2009, and earning it recognition as an IIHS Top Safety Pick.
* The Acura RL incorporated most modern, and some unique, safety features including:
* Advanced Compatibility Engineering (ACE) body structure - ACE features extensive use of high-tensile steel and lightweight aluminum components in a front-mounted polygonal main frame, designed to engage vehicles of differing size and weight in a frontal collision and spread the forces through multiple structural pathways, while preventing or minimizing cabin deformation. The Acura RL was the launch vehicle for the ACE body structure. In 2009, all production Acura vehicles featured the ACE body structure. The ACE body structure is one factor in Acura achieving an all time first in US automotive history, winning simultaneous top marks in both Government National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) crash test ratings
* Super Handling-All Wheel Drive (SH-AWD) - In addition to its performance benefits, the front to rear and side to side torque distribution of SH-AWD works actively to keep the car on the desired line
* Anti-lock Braking System - 3-channel ABS
* Vehicle Stability Assist (Honda Acura version of Vehicle Stability Control) - 4 channel VSA integrated with SH-AWD, ABS, yaw, lateral G, speed and steering angle sensors
* Electronic Traction Control (uses individual wheel ABS sensor and engine modulation)
* Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD) (redistributes front and rear brake pressures as the situation dictates)
* Brake Assist - &quot;learns&quot; the driver&#x27;s braking habits, rate of pressure and total pressure applied, then quickly activates full ABS in a perceived panic stop
* Front Air Bags (2 ea) - including two-stage activation which minimizes injury due to deployment geometry (deploying upward rather than forward into the occupant) and speed
* Front Side Air Bags (2 ea) - including Occupant Position Detection System (OPDS)
* Side Curtain Air Bags (2 ea) - for front and rear passengers
* Occupant Position Detection Sensor (OPDS) system - detects weight and positioning of passenger in the front seat and disables the passenger front side air bag deployment if the system calculates that deployment could cause injury to the occupant, such as a child or small-statured adult
* LATCH child seat anchors
* Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS]) - provides individual pressure readings for each tire and tire position in a graphical display, and alerts the driver in the event of low or no pressure
* bumpers front and back
* Optional Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS) (2006-forward)
* Optional Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) (2006-forward)
* Optional Michelin PAX System run-flat tires (2006–2008)

From the 2006 model year forward, the Acura RL features an optional precrash system called the Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS), which can alert drivers of objects up to 330 feet ahead. If the driver gets dangerously close and does not take evasive action, the RL first provides visible and audible alerts. If the driver does not respond, the electronic pretensioning seatbelt system tugs on the shoulder belts. If the driver still does not react and the collision is deemed unavoidable, the RL retracts and locks seatbelts and brakes hard. Depending on the situation, all three stages may blend together as if one. 

The same CMBS millimeter wave radar was also used to operate the optional Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) feature. The driver selected a cruise speed and could set a timed following distance of 2.0, 1.5 or 1.0 seconds. When the ACC detected a target at any distance up to 330 feet ahead, the engine throttle would be modulated to keep the timed following distance. If throttle modulation did not provide enough slowing, the car would also apply the brakes to help maintain the chosen distance.

RL/Legend models in all markets featured energy-absorbing hood and fender supports and deformable windshield wiper pivots to minimize pedestrian injury.

=== Michelin PAX System ===
From 2006 through 2008, Michelin PAX System run-flat tires were also offered as an option. This system allowed the car to run up to at with a flat.

Michelin PAX System run-flat tires require special equipment to replace them. Such equipment is available only at a limited number of specially certified tire and car dealerships. In April 2008, Michelin announced that it would discontinue its PAX run-flat tires. Unless special equipment is available, the Acura RL&#x27;s optional run-flat tires are usually fixed by replacing the entire wheel/tire assembly. Unlike Honda dealers, Acura dealers were not required to become PAX certified service centers, which included expensive training and specialized machinery. Acura dealers would generally take a flat tire/wheel assembly off and put a new PAX System on the vehicle, or refer the customer to the nearest PAX certified facility.

For warranty and safety reasons, it is not recommended that owners of PAX equipped vehicles switch to another type of tire assembly. Both Acura and Michelin have not been forthcoming about how current owners of PAX equipped Acura RLs can address this impasse once the current supply of PAX tires run out. Some hope that the PAX tire supply will not run out and that they will be continued to be produced on a specialty basis, just as the ill-fated Michelin TRX system tires are still produced today.

Reasons for discontinuing the PAX run-flat system were several, one big reason probably being the class-action suit against Honda and Michelin. Other reasons may have been the difficulty in repair and replacement of PAX tires, which are generally special order and require special mount/demount machinery and training, and the paucity of PAX certified dealers throughout the United States. While RLs have reportedly low incidence of complaints with the premium Michelin Pilot MXM4 all season tires, the opposite was true of the top-of-the-line Honda Odyssey Touring model minivan equipped with Michelin Energy LX4 PAX tires that allegedly did not live up to their promise of long tread life and easy replacement. In addition, during this time, Michelin announced that due to the low general acceptance of the PAX technology throughout the industry, new PAX development would be stopped, although tires would be provided for the foreseeable future. Other PAX equipped vehicles include the world&#x27;s fastest production car, the Bugatti Veyron EB 16.4, and certain Rolls-Royce and Audi vehicles.

===Recalls===

There have been two recalls on the second-generation Acura RL, based on defects in parts used in both Acura and Honda vehicles.

In December 2007, certain 2005–2008 model Acura RLs were subject to a safety recall for the power steering hose. Prolonged high under-hood temperatures may cause the power steering hose to deteriorate prematurely and may cause the hose to crack and leak power steering oil. Oil leaking onto a hot catalytic converter will generate smoke and possibly lead to an under-hood fire. Affected vehicles were to be inspected and repaired, as applicable, at no charge. Reportedly, this recall extended to both 2005–2008 Acura RL and 2004–2008 Acura TL models.

In December 2010, certain 2005–2007 model Acura RLs were subject to a safety recall for potential leaking of the brake master cylinder seal. A seal in the brake master cylinder may be susceptible to damage following the use of brake fluid other than the recommended Acura or (Honda) Genuine DOT3 brake fluid. If the seal is damaged, it can result in a brake fluid leak under certain conditions. If a leak should occur, the driver might see a low brake fluid indicator light or a BRAKE FLUID LOW or CHECK BRAKE SYSTEM message. If the driver continues to drive the vehicle after receiving this message without refilling the brake fluid reservoir, it could result in a brake pedal that feels soft or spongy, and may eventually affect braking performance, increasing the risk of a crash. Affected vehicles were to be inspected and repaired, as applicable, at no charge. Reportedly, this recall applied to both 2005–2007 Acura RL and 2005–2007 Honda Odyssey models.

==Successor==
In April 2012, the Acura RLX concept was introduced by Honda, and the production model debuted at the Los Angeles Auto Show. The initial available trim of the RLX will be front-wheel drive; later the all-wheel drive version will be released featuring a 377-horsepower hybrid engine mated to a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission.

<doc id="670234" wikidata="Q893393" url="?curid=670234" title="Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855">
<text>The Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855 resulted from the 1855 Exposition Universelle de Paris, when Emperor Napoleon III requested a classification system for France&#x27;s best Bordeaux wines that were to be on display for visitors from around the world. Brokers from the wine industry ranked the wines according to a château&#x27;s reputation and trading price, which at that time was directly related to quality.

The wines were ranked in importance from first to fifth growths (&quot;crus&quot;). All of the red wines that made it on the list came from the Médoc region except for one: Château Haut-Brion from Graves. The white wines, then of much less importance than red wine, were limited to the sweet varieties of Sauternes and Barsac and were ranked only from superior first growth to second growth.

== Changes to the classification ==
Within each category, the various châteaux are ranked in order of quality and only twice since the 1855 classification has there been a change: first when in 1856 Cantemerle was added as a fifth growth (having either been originally omitted by oversight or added as an afterthought, depending on which of the conflicting accounts is correct) and, more significantly, in 1973, when Château Mouton Rothschild was elevated from a second growth to a first growth vineyard after decades of intense lobbying by the powerful Philippe de Rothschild. A third, but less known &quot;change&quot;, is the removal of Château Dubignon, a third growth from Margaux that was absorbed into the estate Château Malescot St. Exupéry.

A superficial change is that since 1855, when only five of the estates were styled with the word &quot;château&quot; in their name, most Bordeaux wine estates now use this nomenclature.

== Critique ==
As a classification of châteaux, the actual vineyards owned by some wineries have expanded, shrunk and been divided without any reclassification, and considerable plots of valued &quot;terroir&quot; have changed ownership. Indeed, it is a peculiarity of Bordeaux that as long as a vineyard parcel lies within the boundaries of the wine commune, it is eligible to be used by any chateau, independent of the quality of the parcel itself.

Many wine critics have argued that the 1855 Classification became outdated and does not provide an accurate guide to the quality of the wines being made on each estate. Several proposals have been made for changes to the classification, and a bid for a revision was unsuccessfully attempted in 1960. Alexis Lichine, a member of the 1960 revision panel, launched a campaign to implement changes that lasted over thirty years, in the process publishing several editions of his own unofficial classification and the &quot;Alexis Lichine&#x27;s Guide to the Wines and Vineyards of France&quot;, in which he devoted a chapter to the subject. In support of his argument, Lichine cited the case of Chateau Lynch-Bages, the Pauillac Fifth Growth that, through good management and by patiently collecting the best parcels as they come on the market, makes wine that in his view are worthy of a much higher classification. Conversely, poor management can result in a significant decline in quality, as the example of Chateau Margaux shows—the wines it made in the 1960s and 1970s are widely regarded as far below what&#x27;s expected of a First Growth. Other critics have followed a similar suit, including Robert Parker who published a top 100 Bordeaux estates in 1985 and &quot;L&#x27;histoire de la vigne &amp; du vin&quot; () by Bernard and Henri Enjalbert in 1989, as well as efforts made by Clive Coates (MW) and David Peppercorn (MW). Ultimately nothing has come of them; the likely negative impact on prices for any downgraded châteaux and the 1855 establishment&#x27;s political muscle are considered among the reasons.

In March 2009, the British wine exchange Liv-ex released The Liv-ex Bordeaux Classification, a modern re-calculation of the 1855 classification, with an aim to apply the original method to the contemporary economical context.

Many of the leading estates from the Médoc appellation that were not included in the 1855 classification are classified as &quot;Cru Bourgeois&quot;, a classification system that has been updated on a regular basis since 1932, banned in 2007, but reinstated in 2010.

==The Médoc Classification of 1855==


In French &quot;Les Grands Crus classés en 1855&quot;. The estates are listed with their commune (village), and their AOC in parentheses, if different from the commune. The 19th-century names appear as listed by the brokers on April 18, 1855, followed by the modern names, as the use of &quot;second cru&quot; for red wines and &quot;deuxième cru&quot; for white wines.

<doc id="670241" wikidata="Q1429000" url="?curid=670241" title="Pulvinar nuclei">
<text>The pulvinar nuclei or nuclei of the pulvinar (nuclei pulvinares) are the nuclei (cell bodies of neurons) located in the thalamus (a part of the vertebrate brain). As a group they make up the collection called the pulvinar of the thalamus (pulvinar thalami), usually just called the pulvinar.

The pulvinar is usually grouped as one of the &quot;lateral thalamic nuclei&quot; in rodents and carnivores, and stands as an independent complex in primates. 

Pulvinar acts as an association nucleus that, along with medial dorsal nucleus, connected with parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes, but the function is largely unknown. No distinctive syndrome or obvious sensory deficit can be linked to either one.

==Structure==
By convention, the pulvinar is divided into four nuclei:

Their connectomic details are as follows:

* The &quot;lateral&quot; and &quot;inferior&quot; pulvinar nuclei have widespread connections with early visual cortical areas.
* The dorsal part of the &quot;lateral&quot; pulvinar nucleus predominantly has connections with posterior parietal cortex and the dorsal stream cortical areas.
* The &quot;medial&quot; pulvinar nucleus has widespread connections with cingulate, posterior parietal, premotor and prefrontal cortical areas.
* The pulvinar also has input from the superior colliculus to &quot;inferior&quot;, &quot;lateral&quot; and &quot;medial&quot; sections, which seems to be important in the initiation and compensation of saccade, as well as the regulation of visual attention

==Clinical significance==
No distinctive syndrome or obvious sensory deficit can be linked to the pulvinar. Lesions of the pulvinar can result in neglect syndromes and attentional deficits. In addition, lesions in early life can impact normal visuomotor behaviors such as reaching and grasping. Furthermore, the pulvinar was demonstrated to be instrumental in the preservation of vision afforded to a boy who lost his primary visual cortex bilaterally at birth as well as other forms of blindsight in monkeys and humans. Strokes affecting the pulvinar have also been implicated in the development of chronic pain. In a case study of photophobia caused by blue light, pulvinar nuclei associated with the melanopsin containing ipRGCs visual pathway where bilaterally activated.

==Other animals==
The pulvinar varies in importance in different animals: it is virtually nonexistent in the rat, and grouped as the lateral posterior-pulvinar complex with the lateral posterior thalamic nucleus due to its small size in cats. In humans it makes up roughly 40% of the thalamus making it the largest of its nuclei. Significant research has been undertaken in the marmoset examining the role of the retinorecipient region of the inferior pulvinar (medial subdivision), which projects to visual cortical area MT, in the early development of MT and the dorsal stream, as well as following early-life lesions of the primary visual cortex (V1).

==Etymology==
The word &quot;pulvinar&quot; () in Latin broadly means an armchair lined with numerous pillows. It was first neuroanatomically named by Karl Friedrich Burdach in 1817: &quot;The cushion (pulvinar), a swelling at the posterior end of the inner edge of the upper quadrigemina like a pillow over seats&quot;, English translation (original German: &quot;Das Polster (pulvinar), eine Anschwellung am hintern Ende des inner Randes der obern Vierhügel wie ein Kissen herüber legt&quot;). In Latin &quot;pulvinus&quot; could refer to &quot;a sofa, cushioned seat, seat of honor, easy couch; of the couch or marriage-bed &quot;, or more specifically, &quot;a couch made of cushions, and spread over with a splendid covering, for the gods and persons who received divine honors; a couch or cushioned seat of the gods&quot;. In the religion of ancient Rome, a pulvinar was an hetoimasia or empty throne, cushioned for occupation by a deity. While anatomically, neuroanatomically there was no Roman deity between its arms, there was the pineal gland, that had in the 17th century, been identified by the French philosopher René Descartes as the seat of intellect and soul, and it has been suggested this link contributed to the first naming of this part of the brain by Karl Friedrich Burdach.

<doc id="670264" wikidata="Q815370" url="?curid=670264" title="Beledweyne">
<text>Beledweyne (, ) is a city in central Somalia. Beledweyne District is the capital city of the Hiran region.

The city is situated in the Shebelle Valley riverine near the Ethiopian border, 210 miles (345 km) north of Mogadishu. Beledweyne is divided by the Shebelle River into eastern and western sections. In 2019, Safiya Jimale became the first female mayor in Somalia.

==History==
During the Ethiopian invasion that occurred during June 1982, Beledweyne was a primary objective before driving onto the Somali coastline. On 30 June 1982 the first offensive came at the border town of Ferfer a few kilometers away from the city, in an attempt to capture the high ground overlooking a vital roadway connecting north and south Somalia. Despite heavy ground and air attacks, the army garrison stationed in Beledweyne inflicted heavy losses on the invaders and repulsed the Ethiopians. Soon after a stalemate ensued as the conflict became a border war. 

During the invasion of Somalia in 2006, the Ethiopian Air Force began carrying out airstrikes on Islamic Courts Union targets in the city of Beledweyne and other towns in central Somalia. After Beledweyne had become the target of airstrikes, the Courts decided to withdraw from the city. There were battles in 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2011. In December 2011, the Transitional Federal Government took control of Beledweyne from al-Shabaab. Somali National Army (SNA) soldiers and around 3,000 Ethiopian Army troops descended on the city, capturing it following several hours of fighting.

In April 2008 al-Shabaab fighters killed British/Somalian Headteacher Daud Ali and three of his teachers at the Hiran Educational Project in Beledweyne. This project had been started by Mr Ali to provide a British type education to primary-aged children in the war-torn region.

In 2009, an al-Shabaab suicide car bomber killed 57 people at a hotel. In 2013, they killed 16 people at a restaurant in October and 19 people at a police station in November. In February 2022, an al-Shabaab suicide bomber killed 14 people at a restaurant. In March 2022, they killed over 50 people in a series of attacks.

==Municipality==
On May 7, 2012, Beledweyne held its first mayoral elections since the start of the civil war in the early 1990s. Two hundred delegates took part in the contest, which was overseen by the Hiran region&#x27;s head of elections, Sadaq Omar Sabriye. Mohamed Hassan Nuriye emerged as the new city mayor, obtaining 135 votes versus 11 and 8 votes, respectively, for the two nearest competitors.

In his first day in office, Mayor Nuriye officially banned firearms within the city limits. He also warned that people found contravening the edict would have their weapons impounded and could face imprisonment. In addition, Nuriye indicated that for security reasons, government soldiers who were not on patrol should remain within their bases. Soldiers would likewise only be permitted to carry weapons in the city while conducting security operations.

To further tighten up on security, Beledweyne municipality over a three-day period started simultaneously registering all local residents. Mayor Nuriye also unveiled plans for a citywide beautification campaign. In July 2012, his administration imposed a two-day night-time curfew in Beledweyne, while government soldiers demolished structures that had been illegally erected along the area&#x27;s main road in one of the Municipality&#x27;s first urban renewal initiatives.

In March 2015, the Beledweyne municipality launched a civilian tax collection program in the city. The tax revenue is earmarked for essential public social services. Additionally, the city government is slated to register all local businesses, which will further facilitate tax gathering. The municipal authorities are also scheduled to set up a new citywide house numbering system.

==Transportation==
Beledweyne is served by Beledweyne Airport. As of February 2015, the Djibouti Defense Forces have refurbished the airstrip.

==Demographics==
The district has a total population of 1,500,000 with 79/21 percent rural/urban divide, and it is inhabited by the Hawadle clans.

==Climate==
Beledweyne has a hot arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;). Between March and April, the average daily maximum temperature in the city is . In January and February, the average daily minimum temperature is .

==Notable residents==
* Aden Abdullah Osman Daar, first President of Somalia

<text>Vincennes University (VU) is a public college with its main campus in Vincennes, Indiana, United States. Founded in 1801 as Jefferson Academy, VU is the oldest public institution of higher learning in Indiana. VU was chartered in 1806 as the Indiana Territory&#x27;s four-year university and remained the state of Indiana&#x27;s sole publicly funded four-year university until the establishment of Indiana University in 1820. In 1889, VU was chartered by the State of Indiana as a two-year university. From 1999 to 2005, Vincennes University was in a state-mandated partnership with Ivy Tech State College (changing its name to Ivy Tech Community College). In 2005, VU began offering baccalaureate degrees.

VU&#x27;s campus in Vincennes is a residential campus on the banks of the Wabash River. Other VU sites include a campus in Jasper, Indiana, the Center for Advanced Manufacturing and Logistics in Fort Branch, Indiana, along with centers for Aviation, Logistics, Advanced Manufacturing, and American Sign Language, in the Indianapolis area.

==History==

===Territorial University===
Vincennes University is one of the oldest universities north of the Ohio River and west of the Alleghenies. The institution was founded in 1801 as Jefferson Academy and incorporated as Vincennes University on November 29, 1806. Founded by William Henry Harrison, VU, along with the University at Buffalo and the University of Virginia, are the only colleges founded by United States presidents. For over two hundred years, VU was the only two-year university in Indiana, although baccalaureate degrees in seven select areas are now available and were available prior to 1889.

Vincennes University, also known colloquially as Territorial University during the early 19th century, was the only public university established by the Indiana Territory, prior to the formation of the states of Indiana and Illinois. The town of Vincennes was chosen as the location of both the capital of the Indiana Territory and of the university because it was centrally located at the approximate population-density center of the Indiana Territory. Father Jean Francois Rivet, former professor of Latin at the Royal College of Limoges, France, was the first headmaster of Jefferson Academy, with classes taking place in the main room of the church rectory.

When the Illinois Territory was split from the Indiana Territory in 1809 in preparation for Indiana statehood, Vincennes fell slightly east of the Indiana and Illinois territory border. The formation of the state of Indiana in 1816 (which considered itself an entirely new and separate legal entity from Indiana Territory that had created VU), and the formation of the state of Illinois in 1818, funding for Vincennes University became less and less certain because VU was considered to be owned by the now-defunct Indiana Territory.

Because of Vincennes&#x27; status as the capital of the Indiana Territory, it figured prominently in early Indiana-Illinois territorial and statehood policy. For example, on February 3, 1809, the 10th U.S. Congress passed legislation establishing the separate Indiana Territory in preparation for Indiana&#x27;s proposed statehood. That act established the Indiana-Illinois border not with reference to a landmark along Lake Michigan near Chicago, but rather via direct reference to Vincennes: &quot;all that part of the Indiana Territory which lies west of the Wabash river, and a direct line drawn from the said Wabash river and Post Vincennes, due north to the territorial line between the United States and Canada&quot;.

===State of Indiana&#x27;s state university===
Further complicating the question of funding for VU was the state of Indiana&#x27;s desire to establish its own state-controlled public university in Bloomington, Indiana. Until the establishment of Indiana University, Vincennes University was the sole public university within the entire Indiana Territory and then more narrowly within the state of Indiana. The states of Indiana and Illinois partially abandoned their financial responsibility for the Territorial University after they had established their own separate public universities that did not present the legal complications of an institution whose legal control perhaps spanned the borders of at least two states and had been established by a defunct governmental entity. Conversely, these complications also set the stage for VU&#x27;s two-century long history with some of the most architecturally-significant early 19th-century buildings to be found at any two-year institution in the U.S.

In the mid-19th century, the Indiana state legislature tried to reclaim the original VU land grant, to be used for what would become Indiana University. The resulting lawsuit (Trustees for Vincennes University v Indiana, 1853) was eventually heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, who decided in VU&#x27;s favor, based on its earlier decision in a similar case regarding Dartmouth College. The legal dispute arose in part because a portion of VU&#x27;s status as a land-grant public university derived from the fact that VU is the inheritor of the land-grant and facilities of Territorial University.

To clarify the mission of VU &quot;vis a vis&quot; Indiana&#x27;s other institutions of higher education at the time (Purdue University, the State Normal School, and Indiana University), the state of Indiana rechartered VU in 1889, changing it from a four-year university to a two-year university.

===Tau Phi Delta and the Sigma Pi fraternity===

In 1897, a small literary society called Tau Phi Delta was started at VU, which soon after became the founding (&quot;Alpha&quot;) chapter of Sigma Pi fraternity, making that organization the first of its kind to be founded west of the Ohio Valley. A clock tower on the VU campus commemorates that event. The fraternity has since grown into one of the largest collegiate fraternities and, despite relocating its headquarters to Tennessee; they continue to recognize VU as its birthplace.

===Relationship with Ivy Tech Community College===
In 1999, Indiana Governor Frank O&#x27;Bannon and Stan Jones, commissioner for higher education, persuaded the Indiana state legislature to mandate a &quot;coordinated partnership&quot; between Vincennes University and what was then called Ivy Tech State College. Writing for a national publication, reporter William Trombley characterized the &quot;shotgun marriage&quot; as something that was spoken of cautiously by officials at both institutions: &quot;It was not our initiative,&quot; Vincennes President Phillip M. Summers said in an interview. &quot;We were asked if we would participate and we agreed&quot;. Thomas Cooke, dean of instruction at the Ivy Tech Indianapolis campus, said &quot;We have everything except the liberal arts degree ... And that could be easily accommodated within our present structure&quot; (4). This tenuous arrangement was dissolved by the 2005 rechartering of Ivy Tech State College as a statewide system of comprehensive community colleges named Ivy Tech Community College.

==Athletics==

VU is a member of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA). In honor of its local heritage, the VU team moniker is the Trailblazers. Trailblazers refers to the early years of Vincennes as a French fur-trading post and American outpost in the frontier of the Northwest Territory and its later period as capital of the Indiana Territory. When the Trailblazers moniker needs to be personified by a mascot, VU depicts a Trailblazer as minute man or woodsman-type frontier settler, inspired by such as George Rogers Clark who resided in Indiana after his military career.

The VU Trailblazers compete in baseball, bowling, golf, basketball, cross country, volleyball, and track and field. Its bowling team is particularly well known as it has won 21 NJCAA national championships. The men&#x27;s bowling team won the 1983 USBC collegiate national championship. The men&#x27;s basketball team is a national NJCAA power, winning national titles in 1965, 1970, 1972 and 2019; they were national finalists in 1986. The men&#x27;s cross-country team won NJCAA titles in 1969 and 1971; they have 12 additional &quot;Top Ten&quot; finishes in the NJCAA National Finals.

<doc id="670267" wikidata="Q3502714" url="?curid=670267" title="Suburbia (film)">
<text>Suburbia (also known as Rebel Streets and The Wild Side) is a 1983 American coming-of-age thriller drama film written and directed by Penelope Spheeris and produced by Roger Corman. The film&#x27;s plot concerns a group of suburban youths who run away from home and adopt a punk lifestyle by squatting in abandoned suburban tract homes. The punks are played by Chris Pedersen, Bill Coyne, Timothy Eric O&#x27;Brien, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea and others.

The film contains live footage of D.I. performing &quot;Richard Hung Himself&quot;, T.S.O.L. performing &quot;Wash Away&quot; and &quot;Darker My Love&quot; and the Vandals performing &quot;The Legend of Pat Brown&quot;.

The film inspired the 1986 Pet Shop Boys song of the same name.

==Plot==
Sheila, a hitchhiking teenage runaway, is picked up on Interstate 605 in the Greater Los Angeles Area by a woman with a toddler. When the car gets a flat tire, they find a telephone booth on the edge of an abandoned tract housing district. While the mother is on the phone, the toddler is attacked and killed by a stray dog.

Another teenage runaway, Evan Johnson, leaves his suburban home and abusive, alcoholic mother, ending up at a punk rock concert by D.I., where Keef slips drugs into his drink. The concert ends abruptly when a female attendee has her clothes torn off by the punks in the audience. Jack Diddley offers Evan a place to stay at &quot;T.R. House&quot;, a punk house in the abandoned tract housing district off Interstate 605. Along the way, they pick up Joe Schmo, who also intends to move into the house. Joe changes his mind when he learns each resident must be branded with the letters T.R. (&quot;The Rejected&quot;), but winds up coming back and accepting the brand. He begins to form a romantic relationship with Sheila, who has also moved into the house.

The next morning, several men from &quot;Citizens Against Crime&quot;, including Jim Tripplett and Bob Skokes, kill local stray dogs in a drive-by shooting. T.R. kids Razzle and Skinner confront them, but the situation is defused by Jack&#x27;s stepfather, police Officer Bill Rennard. Jack, Evan, and Skinner steal food for the house by raiding the garages of a nearby suburban neighborhood, and they make further enemies of Jim and Bob by disrupting their garage sale. When Evan sees on the news that his mother has been arrested for drunk driving, he collects his younger brother, Ethan, and brings him to live at T.R. House, where Sheila gives him a mohawk. Sheila admits to Joe that she was physically and sexually abused by her father.

During a T.S.O.L. concert, the T.R. gang get into a fight defending Skinner. The men (Possibly Citizens Against Crime members) with whom they were fighting enter the concert and stab a security guard, framing the T.R. kids for the crime by using the knife to hang a flier with &quot;T.R.&quot; written in blood. Jim and Bob next witness the T.R. crew vandalizing a convenience store. At a Citizens Against Crime meeting, they accuse Bill and the rest of the police of not doing enough to curb the teenagers&#x27; criminal behavior, declaring their willingness to take the law into their own hands. Bill goes to T.R. House and implores the teens to stay out of trouble. That night, Jim and Bob invade the house and threaten the teens, assaulting Sheila in the process. The next morning, the kids find that Sheila has killed herself by overdosing on Keef&#x27;s drugs. Not knowing what to do, they bring her body back to her parents. When the T.R. kids come to the funeral, Sheila&#x27;s father insists that they leave. Joe reveals his knowledge of Sheila&#x27;s abuse, and a fight breaks out, hospitalizing Sheila&#x27;s father.

At a Vandals concert that night, Bill shows up and warns the T.R. kids to clear out of T.R. house immediately, before their actions bring the Citizens Against Crime down on their heads, but they decide to stay. Learning of the violence at the funeral, Jim and Bob show up at the house and are attacked by the teens, who drive them off. They bring their car back around for another pass, accidentally running over and killing Ethan. Bill arrives, but is too late to prevent the tragedy. It is likely that Jim and Bob were either arrested or charged.

==Cast==
Cameos
* D.I. (Casey Royer, Fredric Taccone, Tim Maag, Derek O&#x27;Brien)
* T.S.O.L. (Jack Grisham, Ron Emory, Mike Roche, Todd Barnes, Greg Kuehn)
* The Vandals (Stevo, Jan Ackerman, Joseph Escalante, Steve Pfauter)

==Production==
Director Penelope Spheeris was inspired to write and direct the film when seeing a lack of release for her punk documentary &quot;The Decline of Western Civilization&quot; (1981). As such, owing to her time spent around the scene, she took inspiration from stories and incidents she had seen or heard when writing the script, whether that was stray dogs that actually were roaming streets owing to a guard dog training school being closed down to let the dogs run wild. She recruited street youths and punk-rock musicians to play each role rather than hiring actors.

Spheeris said she provided $250,000 of the budget and Roger Corman the other $250,000. She said, &quot;Roger made biker movies and exploitation movies and that sort of thing, so luckily he wanted to do the movie because he felt this might be the new wave. But, you know, he didn&#x27;t really interfere too much. It was mostly that he wanted me to have that scene up front where the kid gets nuked by the dog.&quot;

==Reception==
Vincent Canby called the film a &quot;clear-eyed, compassionate melodrama about a bunch of young dropouts&quot; and &quot;probably the best teen-agers-in-revolt movie since Jonathan Kaplan&#x27;s &quot;Over the Edge&quot;.&quot;

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 93% based on 15 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10.

<doc id="670269" wikidata="Q1540440" url="?curid=670269" title="Government Center, Boston">
<text>Government Center is an area in downtown Boston, centered on City Hall Plaza. Formerly the site of Scollay Square, it is now the location of Boston City Hall, courthouses, state and federal office buildings, and a major MBTA subway station, also called Government Center. Its development was controversial, as the project displaced thousands of residents and razed several hundred homes and businesses.

Controversial in design since before it was completed, the use of Brutalist architecture for its main buildings, as well as the open brick-and-concrete plaza at the center of the development, have been alternately praised for its innovative design, and scorned for its lack of character and uninviting appearance. After decades of calls for a redesign to make it more friendly and usable, a major rebuild of City Hall Plaza, the main public space of Government Center, was begun in 2020 and is to include additional seating areas, play spaces for children, and space for public art.

==History==

===Post-colonial development and commerce===
Scollay Square was named for William Scollay, a prominent local developer and militia officer who bought a landmark four-story merchant building at the intersection of Cambridge and Court Streets in 1795. Local citizens began to refer to the intersection as Scollay&#x27;s Square, and, in 1838, the city officially memorialized the intersection as Scollay Square.

Early on, the area was a busy center of commerce, including the city&#x27;s first daguerreotypist (photographer), Josiah Johnson Hawes (1808–1901), and Dr. William Thomas Green Morton, the first dentist to use ether as an anaesthetic.

Local cultural landmarks took form, attracting visits from such intellectual contemporaries as Charles Dickens.

===Abolitionism===

Scollay Square was also a flashpoint for the early abolition movement. Author William Lloyd Garrison was twice attacked by an angry mob for printing his anti-slavery newspaper &quot;The Liberator&quot;, which began publication in 1831. Sarah Parker Remond&#x27;s first act of civil disobedience occurred in 1853 at the Old Howard when she was refused the seat she had purchased but was instead seated in the &#x27;black&#x27; section. Many of the buildings in the area in and around Scollay Square had hidden spaces where escaped slaves were hidden, as part of the Underground Railroad.

===The Old Howard===
Among the most famous (and infamous) of Scollay Square landmarks was the Old Howard Theatre, a grand theater which began life as the headquarters of a Millerite Adventist Christian sect which believed the world would end in October 1844. After the world failed to end on schedule, the building was sold in 1844 and reopened as a vaudeville and Shakespearean venue. Later, in the 1900s and 1910s, it would showcase the popular minstrel shows.

By around the 1940s the Scollay Square area began to lose its vibrant commercial activity, and the Howard gradually changed its image and began to cater to sailors on leave and college students by including burlesque shows, as did other nearby venues such as the Casino Theater and Crawford House. &quot;Always Something Doing&quot; became the Old Howard&#x27;s advertising slogan. The venue also showcased boxing matches with such old-time greats as local Rocky Marciano and John L. Sullivan, and continued to feature slapstick vaudeville acts, from likes of The Marx Brothers and Abbott and Costello.

But it was the success and prominence of the burlesque shows that brought the Old Howard down. In 1953, vice squad agents sneaked a home movie camera into the Old Howard, and caught Mary Goodneighbor on film doing her striptease for the audience. The film led to the closure of the theater, and it remained closed until it caught fire mysteriously in 1961.

The square was also the home of Austin and Stone&#x27;s Dime Museum.

===Destruction and redevelopment===
As early as the 1950s, city officials had been mulling plans to completely tear down and redevelop the Scollay Square area, in order to remove lower-income residents and troubled businesses from the aging and seedy district. Attempts to reopen the sullied Old Howard by its old performers had been one of the last efforts against redevelopment; but with the theater gutted by fire, a city wrecking ball began the project of demolishing over 1000 buildings in the area; 20,000 residents were displaced.

With $40 million in federal funds, the city built an entirely new development on top of old Scollay Square, renaming the area Government Center, and peppering it with city, state, and federal government buildings.

A 1958 report by the Boston Planning Board, entitled Government Center Project, set out the case for construction of a center:

==Major structures==

===Boston City Hall===
The dominant feature of Government Center is the enormous, imposing, and brutalist Boston City Hall, designed by Kallmann McKinnell &amp; Wood and built in the 1960s as part of Boston&#x27;s first large urban renewal scheme. While considered by some to have architectural merit, the building is not universally admired, and is sharply unpopular among locals. Furthermore, it is resented for having replaced the Victorian architecture of Boston&#x27;s Scollay Square, a lively commercial district that lapsed into squalor in the twentieth century.

===John Fitzgerald Kennedy Federal Building===
John Fitzgerald Kennedy Federal Building is a United States government office building. It is located across City Hall Plaza from Boston City Hall. An example of 1960s modern architecture, it consists of two 26 floor towers that sit on-axis to each other and a low rise building of four floors that connects to the two towers via an enclosed glass corridor. The two towers stand at a height of .

===City Hall Plaza===
City Hall Plaza is not a well-loved space, either. As Bill Wasik wrote in 2006, &quot;It is as if the space were calibrated to render futile any gathering, large or small, attempted anywhere on its arid expanse. All the nearby buildings seem to be facing away, making the plaza&#x27;s of concrete and brick feel like the world&#x27;s largest back alley. ... [It is] so devoid of benches, greenery, and other signposts of human hospitality that even on the loveliest fall weekend, when the Common and Esplanade and other public spaces teem with Bostonians at leisure, the plaza stands utterly empty save for the occasional skateboarder…&quot; The plaza is often colloquially referred to as &quot;the brick desert.&quot;

===Government Service Center===
Another very large Brutalist building at Government Center, less prominently located and thus less well known than City Hall, is the Government Service Center, designed by architect Paul Rudolph. The building is unfinished as the tall central tower in the original plan was never built. In the mid-1990s, the adjacent space was filled with the Edward W. Brooke Courthouse, which houses a division of the Boston Municipal Court. This irregularly shaped, sloping lot was the last parcel to be developed of the Government Center urban renewal plan; in the interim the space was used as surface parking. In a 2014 article, architectural historian Timothy M. Rohan praised the building for having &quot;a wondrous interior courtyard like something from baroque Rome, a space that even in its incomplete and neglected state contrasts sharply with nearby City Hall and its alienating plaza.&quot;
===Government Center Garage===
This 2,300-space privately owned garage was built as part of the Government Center urban renewal project. In 2016, the Boston Redevelopment Authority gave final approval for the replacement of the garage with &quot;Bulfinch Crossing,&quot; a mixed-use development designed by Pelli Clarke Pelli Architects. Construction began in January 2017. The design of the office tower was revealed in June 2019.

===Center Plaza===
This office and retail structure, built by developer Norman B. Leventhal, is across Cambridge Street from City Hall Plaza. In 2014, the property was sold by the Blackstone Group to Shorenstein Properties. Shorenstein Properties has proposed a $25 million renovation designed &quot;to add some new buzz&quot; to the building. The renovation was approved by the Boston Redevelopment Authority in 2016.

===Nearby public buildings===
Several state and federal government buildings near Government Center were not built as part of the urban renewal project. These include the Massachusetts State House, the McCormack Building, the Saltonstall Building, the Suffolk County Courthouse, and the Thomas P. O&#x27;Neill Jr. Federal Building.

===Sears&#x27; Crescent and Sears&#x27; Block===

The Sears&#x27; Crescent and Sears&#x27; Block are a pair of 19th century buildings that border City Hall Plaza on the south.

The golden steaming kettle mounted on the corner of the Sears&#x27; Block, 63-65 Court Street, pre-dates the Government Center redevelopment. It was manufactured for the Oriental Tea Company in 1873, which held a contest to guess the volume of the kettle and staged a spectacle in which nine children and a tall man crawled out of the kettle. Its volume was measured by the city&#x27;s official sealer of weights and measures at 227 gallons, 2 quarts, 1 pint, and 3 gills, () which for a time was painted on the side. The tea shop at 85-87 Court Street was demolished, but the owner, Nathan Sharaf, opened Steaming Kettle Coffee Shop in the new building and mounted the kettle. It became Croissant Du Jour in 1988, then Coffee Connection, then Starbucks in 1997.

==Geography and transportation==
Government Center is located between the North End, Downtown, and Beacon Hill neighborhoods.

===Boundaries===
Government Center does not have official boundaries. A 2011 Boston Redevelopment Authority map of Boston neighborhoods shows most of the Government Center area as part of the Downtown neighborhood, and the rest as part of the West End.

Other maps and documents show a variety of different boundaries for Government Center. The Boston Zoning Code has a map called &quot;1H Government Center/Markets District.&quot; The map shows the Government Center portion of the district extending as far west as the Massachusetts State House and including all of the major structures listed in this article. The Boston Redevelopment Authority map of &quot;Urban Renewal Areas&quot; includes a somewhat smaller area that excludes the McCormack and Saltonstall Buildings.

By contrast, a search for &quot;Government Center&quot; on Google Maps yields a map showing an even smaller area that is bounded by Court, Cambridge, Sudbury, and Congress Streets. The AirBnB neighborhood map shows a somewhat larger area than the Google Map. An undated Boston Redevelopment Authority map entitled &quot;Government Center Urban Renewal Area Illustrative Site Plan&quot; showed similar boundaries.

===Mass transit===
Scollay Square station opened as part of the third phase of the Tremont Street Subway in September 1898, bringing subway service to the area with a stone headhouse in the center of the square. Court Street station opened on the East Boston Tunnel in December 1904; it was closed in 1914 and replaced by a lower level (Scollay Under) to the Scollay Square station in 1916. The station was rebuilt in 1963 as Government Center station with a low brick headhouse, and again from 2014 to 2016 with a large glass headhouse that dominates the south side of the plaza. It serves as the transfer point between the MBTA&#x27;s Blue and Green Lines.

===Surroundings===
Government Center is adjacent to historic Faneuil Hall and popular Quincy Market and very near the Old State House. It is two blocks away from the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway, which was created as part of the Big Dig. Major city streets in the vicinity include Tremont, Congress, Cambridge, State, New Chardon, and Washington Streets. Hints of another street, Cornhill, still exist along one edge of City Hall Plaza. Two of the neighborhood&#x27;s few remaining old buildings, the Sears&#x27; Crescent and Sears&#x27; Block, face the plaza and follow the original curve of Cornhill. A veteran&#x27;s home &amp; services provider, still has an entrance with a Cornhill address. Plans for Government Center, including the Boston Redevelopment Authority&#x27;s &quot;Government center 2000 project&quot;, called for the construction of two footbridges over Congress Street to connect City Hall Plaza to the Faneuil Hall area. Neither bridge was built.

<text>David Pablo Nalbandian (; born 1 January 1982) is an Argentine former professional tennis player. He reached his highest ranking in singles of world No. 3 in March 2006, during a career that spanned from 2000 to 2013. Nalbandian was runner-up in the singles event at the 2002 Wimbledon Championships. During his career, he won 11 singles titles, including the Tennis Masters Cup in 2005 and two Masters 1000 tournaments. Nalbandian is the only Argentine man in history to reach the semifinals or better at all four majors and to reach the Wimbledon final. He was a member of the Argentinian Davis Cup team who reached the finals of the World Group in 2006, 2008 and 2011. Nalbandian played right-handed with a two-handed backhand, regarded at the time to be one of the best on tour. Nalbandian was considered one of the greatest players to have never won a Grand Slam title. Since his retirement, Nalbandian has taken up the sport of rally racing and has competed in Rally Argentina.

==Biography==
Of Armenian and Italian descent, David Nalbandian was born in the small city of Unquillo in Córdoba Province, Argentina. He became a professional tennis player at the age of 18.

==Career on the ATP==

===Junior career===
As a junior, Nalbandian reached as high as No. 3 in the world in December 1998 (and No. 5 in doubles in 2000), soon after winning the US Open boys&#x27; singles final over fellow junior Roger Federer.

===2000–2002===
He turned professional in 2000. In 2001, he finished in the ATP top 50 for the first time. He finished 2002 as the No. 1 Argentine and South American for the first time in his career, winning two ATP titles and reaching the Wimbledon final, where he beat David Sánchez, Paul-Henri Mathieu, George Bastl, Wayne Arthurs, Nicolás Lapentti and Xavier Malisse before losing to Lleyton Hewitt. 

===2003–2004===
Nalbandian did not reach another major final in 2003. At Wimbledon he lost to Tim Henman, following a stomach injury during his previous match against Karol Kucera. In 2004, Nalbandian achieved his best result at the French Open reaching the semifinals, losing to eventual champion Gastón Gaudio. Although he did not win any titles in 2004, he did finish runner-up at both the Rome Masters and the Madrid Masters, by Carlos Moyá and Marat Safin respectively. He broke into the top 5 for the first time in his career in August and finished 2004 ranked as the World No. 9 player.

===2005===
In 2005, Nalbandian advanced to the quarterfinals of the Australian Open, Wimbledon, and the U.S. Open. At Wimbledon, Nalbandian came from two sets down to defeat Andy Murray in the third round, in what was Murray&#x27;s first Major tournament. He wound up being the only player to ever defeat Murray from two sets down. He also won the Tennis Masters Cup, becoming only the second Argentine tennis player in history (after Guillermo Vilas in 1974) to win the year-end tournament. Having replaced Andy Roddick, he won two of his three group matches (to Federer, Ivan Ljubičić, and Guillermo Coria). In the semifinals, he defeated Russian Nikolay Davydenko, and in the final, he beat World No. 1 Roger Federer in a fifth-set tiebreak after coming from two sets down, with Federer succumbing to a right ankle injury after laboring out the first two sets in tiebreaks. Nalbandian became the first player to win the cup without previously attaining a Grand Slam or Masters Series title.

===2006===
In January 2006, Nalbandian beat Fabrice Santoro in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open, becoming, at the time, only the second active player (along with Roger Federer) to have reached the semifinals of each Grand Slam tournament. He lost in the semifinals to Marcos Baghdatis in a hard-fought five-set match, despite holding a two-set-to-love advantage and four games to two in the final set. In May, he won the Estoril Open Tournament in Portugal for the second time, being one of only three men to achieve this accomplishment (Carlos Costa, 1992 and 1994; and Thomas Muster, 1995 and 1996). One month later, Nalbandian reached his second French Open semifinal. It was the only time in his career that he reached two Grand Slam semifinals in one calendar year. He played Federer and started strongly, winning the first set and going 3–0 up in the second set. At 5–2 down in the third set, Nalbandian decided to retire from the match due to stomach injury. At Wimbledon, Nalbandian was beaten in the third round, where he lost to Fernando Verdasco in straight sets. At the US Open, Nalbandian was beaten in the second round by Marat Safin.

Nalbandian then competed in the Davis Cup semifinal tie against Australia. David easily won against Mark Philippoussis to give Argentina a 1–0 lead. Argentina went on to win 5–0 to reach the Davis Cup final. Later in the year, Nalbandian reached semifinals at the Masters Series Madrid and the Masters Cup, where he lost to Roger Federer and James Blake, respectively. Despite winning both of his singles rubbers in the Davis Cup final against Safin and Nikolay Davydenko, Nalbandian could not stop the Russian Davis Cup team. Argentina went on to lose 3–2. 

===2007===
2007 saw Nalbandian drop out of the world&#x27;s top 20 for the first time since 2003, after losing in the fourth round of the 2007 French Open to Nikolay Davydenko. Nalbandian suffered various abdominal injuries, a back injury, and a leg injury during the year.
He fell to no. 26 in the world until his season changed after winning the 2007 Madrid Masters. He won the tournament by defeating second seed Rafael Nadal, third seed Novak Djokovic, and top seed Federer in consecutive rounds, becoming the third player after Boris Becker and Djoković to defeat the world&#x27;s top three players in a single tournament. He defeated Nadal in the quarterfinals. His good form carried him to his second top-3 win of the tournament, defeating Djoković in the semifinals. He stunned Federer in the final and reached the doubles semifinals with Guillermo Cañas in the tournament, before losing to top-seeded brothers Bob and Mike Bryan in the semifinals. After the tournament, his singles ranking moved up from no. 25 on the tour to No. 18. Nalbandian was the only player ever to defeat all 3 members of the big three at the same tournament.

He played at the 2007 Paris Masters and again defeated Federer, in the third round. He beat David Ferrer in the quarterfinals in a closely fought match. After beating Richard Gasquet in the semifinals, Nalbandian won his second straight ATP Masters Series title over Rafael Nadal, thus, becoming the first player to win the Madrid and Paris Masters back to back since former world no. 1, Marat Safin in 2004. This win allowed him to move back into the world&#x27;s top 10 at No. 9. After the Paris Masters, Nalbandian became the first player to defeat No. 1 and No. 2 players in consecutive tournaments and win them. 

===2008===

Nalbandian began his 2008 season back in the top 10. However, at the Australian Open, he failed to reach the quarterfinals, suffering a straight sets loss to the 22nd seed Juan Carlos Ferrero in the third round. On 24 February 2008, he won the Copa Telmex in Buenos Aires, beating José Acasuso in the final. With that win, he moved to World No. 8. The following week, He arrived at the Abierto Mexicano Telcel in Acapulco, Mexico and cruised all the way to the finals, along the way defeating Boris Pašanski, Santiago Ventura, Potito Starace, and Luis Horna, beating them all in straight sets, but then lost in the final, to Spaniard Nicolás Almagro.

He entered his first ATP Masters Series tournament of the year at the 2008 Pacific Life Open, and defeated Ernests Gulbis, Radek Štěpánek and Juan Carlos Ferrero, to whom he lost earlier in the year at the Australian Open. He lost, however, in the quarterfinals against Mardy Fish in a very close match. He lost at the Monte Carlo Masters to eventual finalist Federer. In Barcelona, he was the third seed but was eliminated by Stanislas Wawrinka in the third round. At the 2008 Rome Masters, he fell in his opening match to Almagro.

At the French Open, Nalbandian suffered a shock loss in the second round to Frenchman Jérémy Chardy. After being two sets up and seemingly in control, he lost the next three to hand Chardy the win. He also suffered early exits from both Wimbledon and the US Open, losing in the second round and third round, respectively. His indoor season, however, was a success, as he won his ninth career title at the 2008 Stockholm Open, defeating Robin Söderling in the final. He was defending champion at the Madrid Masters but was quickly eliminated by fellow Argentine Juan Martín del Potro in the third round. He then entered both the Davidoff Swiss Indoors and the BNP Paribas Masters, where he was once again the defending champion. He did not win either of these tournaments but found himself in the finals of both.

To end the year, he participated in the 2008 Davis Cup and was up on an opening match against David Ferrer. Despite a victory, he ended up on the losing team against Spain in the Davis Cup finals in Argentina (The Argentine team lost 1–3). He made some offensive comments in the press against Spain, the Spanish tennis team, and Rafael Nadal. It was rumoured that he and Agustín Calleri were involved in a fight after they lost their doubles rubber. Nalbandian denied this. He was fined $10,000 for leaving the stadium after his and Calleri&#x27;s defeat in doubles to Spaniards Fernando Verdasco and Feliciano López, and for his refusal to appear at a subsequent press conference to comment on the Argentine team&#x27;s setback. 

===2009===
Nalbandian started his 2009 tour by winning his tenth career ATP title at the Medibank International in Sydney, Australia, after defeating Finland&#x27;s Jarkko Nieminen in the final. At the Australian Open, he defeated Marc Gicquel in the first round, in four sets before being upset by unseeded Taiwanese player Lu Yen-Hsun in five sets in the second round. At the 2009 BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, California, he lost to World No. 1 Rafael Nadal in the fourth round for the first time, failing to convert on five match points in the second set. In May, he announced that he would have to undergo hip surgery, resulting in not being able to compete in the remaining Grand Slams and the Davis Cup. In August, he announced that he would return to practice and eventually to competitive tennis at the Australian Open in January. A few days before the beginning of the tournament, he was forced to withdraw from the event due to an abdominal injury. 

===2010===
Because of several knee injuries in the early part of the 2010 season, he finally made a return, beginning at the 2010 Copa Telmex, his hometown tournament. He beat Potito Starace in the first round over a period of two days due to a rain delay. In the second round, he beat Daniel Gimeno-Traver. However, he pulled out of his quarterfinals match against fifth seed Albert Montañés due to a right leg injury. He made a return to tennis by playing doubles for Argentina in the Davis Cup against Sweden in Stockholm, which he won in straight sets. He played the deciding singles rubber, defeating Vinciguerra and helped Argentina reach the quarterfinals. 

Playing in his first Masters Series event since Monte Carlo the previous year, he appeared at the 2010 BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells. There, he won his first-round match against Stefan Koubek. In his next-round match, he played 22nd seed Jürgen Melzer and lost. He then entered the 2010 Sony Ericsson Open in Miami as a wildcard entrant. He beat Łukasz Kubot and Viktor Troicki before falling to Rafael Nadal in three sets. He entered the 2010 Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters in Monaco, ranked No. 151 in the world, beating Andreas Beck in straight sets, before coming through against World No. 13 Mikhail Youzhny of Russia in the second round. Nalbandian beat Tommy Robredo, before losing in the quarterfinals to the second-ranked Novak Djokovic. Nalbandian withdrew from the 2010 Internazionali BNL d&#x27;Italia with a right leg injury. The injury persisted, and he withdrew from the 2010 Mutua Madrileña Madrid Open, the 2010 Roland Garros and the 2010 Wimbledon Championships. 

In July, he played two singles matches for Argentina against Russia in the Davis Cup at the Olympic Stadium in Moscow. He defeated Nikolay Davydenko in the first rubber and Mikhail Youzhny in the fifth and final rubber, giving Argentina a victory of 3–2 to qualify for the semifinals. He made his return in the 2010 Legg Mason Tennis Classic, where he won the title, his first since 2009 Medibank International Sydney after wins over Rajeev Ram, Stanislas Wawrinka, Marco Chiudinelli, Gilles Simon and Marin Čilić. He defeated Marcos Baghdatis in the finals, guaranteeing a jump in the rankings up to the vicinity of world no. 45. The following week, he had a successful run to the quarterfinals in the Roger&#x27;s Masters Series in Toronto, defeating David Ferrer, Tommy Robredo, and Robin Söderling, before losing to World No. 4 Andy Murray after this 11-match winning streak. This run took his rank up to world No. 37. He competed at the 2010 BNP Paribas Masters, where he lost again to Murray in the second round. 

In November he was granted the Platinum Konex Award as the best tennis player of the last decade in Argentina.

===2011===

Nalbandian began the year ranked No. 27 in the world. As sixth seed in the Auckland Open, Nalbandian beat Fabio Fognini, Philipp Kohlschreiber, John Isner, and Nicolás Almagro, without losing a set. However, he lost in the final against David Ferrer. His performance propelled him to the rank of No. 21 in the world, while also achieving the no. 1 Argentina position at the expense of Juan Martín del Potro, who was also injured. He faced Lleyton Hewitt again. The match, dubbed the &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot;, went in the fifth set as in 2005, but this time for Nalbandian, after 57 games. He saved two match points, but in the second round was forced to retire due to cramps and fatigue, 1–6, 0–6, 0–2, to Ričardas Berankis. After the Australian Open, he played in the Movistar Open.

He began his tour on clay by beating his compatriot Carlos Berlocq, before losing against Horacio Zeballos. In Buenos Aires, he lost in the quarterfinals to Tommy Robredo. He played a Davis Cup match, winning in four sets against Romanian Adrian Ungur. Due to a torn hamstring and a hernia, he missed many tournaments including Indian Wells, Miami, Monte Carlo, Madrid and Rome Masters. He lost to Roger Federer in the third round of Wimbledon. 

===2012===
In the Australian Open, Nalbandian had a five-set loss to Isner and was fined $8,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct following the match. On February, David participated in two Davis Cup matches for Argentina against the German team, defeating Florian Mayer in a singles match and then partnering with Eduardo Schwank to win a doubles match against Tommy Haas and Philipp Petzschner to help the Argentinian team advance to the quarterfinals. Afterward, Nalbandian played a string of clay tournaments, reaching the quarterfinals in the Brasil Open, semifinals in Buenos Aires and a first-round exit at the Mexican Open. He then entered the first ATP Masters 1000 tournament of the year, the 2012 BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, losing in the quarterfinals to Rafael Nadal. After the tournament, Nalbandian reached No. 40 in the ATP rankings but failed to progress past the first round in the 2012 French Open as he was beaten by the Romanian, Adrian Ungur in four sets.

====Queen&#x27;s Club Championships incident====
In June, Nalbandian reached the final of the Aegon Championships at the Queen&#x27;s Club in England for the first time. He led his opponent Marin Čilić by a set but, having been broken to trail 3–4 in the second, was disqualified when he violently kicked a wooden partition in front of a seated line judge, injuring the linesman and drawing blood from his shin.

The kick was broadcast live on the BBC television coverage of the event, and a clip showing the incident was widely viewed on YouTube. A complaint alleging assault was made to the Metropolitan Police, who commenced investigations. An ATP spokesman stated that:Nalbandian automatically forfeited his prize money and ranking points due to his conduct default. A maximum £8,000 (10,000 euro) fine was issued on site by the ATP Supervisor for unsportsmanlike conduct. In forfeiting his potential prize money of £36,114 [$57,350] plus the £8,000 [$12,560] conduct fine, he incurred a total loss over the weekend of £44,114 [$69,910]. He was additionally docked 150 ranking points by the ATP.

Nalbandian was unseeded at the Wimbledon championships, which followed soon after, and was defeated in straight sets by Janko Tipsarević in the first round. He lost again to Tipsarević in the first round at the London Olympics.

====US Open withdrawal====
Nalbandian withdrew from the 2012 US Open due to a strained muscle in his chest, one day before his scheduled first-round match against compatriot and 2009 champion Juan Martín del Potro.

===2013===
He played the last final of his career at the 2013 Brasil Open, where he lost to Rafael Nadal. After the quarterfinal win over France in the Davis Cup, where he played doubles, he was forced to undergo an operation on his right shoulder, sidelining him for much of the 2013 season. On 1 October, he announced his retirement.

==After tennis==
Nalbandian has sought to continue a sporting career and has taken up Rallying in the Argentine Rally Championship. Since then his career has progressed to appearances in the Codasur South American Rally Championship and one appearance in the World Rally Championship. Mostly he races an Argentine specification Chevrolet Agile.

In February 2021, he has been hired as a coach by Miomir Kecmanović.

==Playing style==
Nalbandian was an all-court player and a clean ball-striker, hitting powerful groundstrokes. He had a decent, but not particularly dominating service game compared to top 20 players. His signature play was the wide drive that swings out of court on both sides, low and spinning. He could return high balls on both wings with acute angles and low trajectories, using these skills with great tactical intelligence.

His ground game was complemented by his anticipation, speed and ability to end points at the net. Nalbandian&#x27;s trademark shot is his double-handed backhand down-the-line, which was often regarded as one of the best double-handed backhands of all time. He often used it to set up a point, by either hitting a clean winner or forcing a weak return from the opponent. Nalbandian is also known to be one of the game&#x27;s best returners. He was consistently able to knock balls back deep on the baseline to effectively set up the point or hit return winners off second serves, but he also had the ability to block it back deep when returning a more effective serve. He also used a &quot;chip-and-charge&quot; technique against the opponents&#x27; serves to surprise them.

Early in his career, Nalbandian was considered one of the most talented young players on tour, and touted as a future star of the game, alongside the likes of Roger Federer, Marat Safin and Andy Roddick. Early in his career, he was cited as a rival of Federer, having beaten him five times consecutively between 2002 and 2003. However, injuries, lack of consistency, and poor mental temperament have been cited as his biggest weaknesses that prevented him from achieving his full potential. Nalbandian has been considered by a lot of commentators and fans as one of the biggest underachievers in the game.

<text>Nathaniel de Rothschild (1812–1870), was a businessman, banker and winemaker. He established the Château Mouton Rothschild.

== Early life ==
Nathaniel de Rothschild was born on 2 July 1812 in London. He was the fourth child of Nathan Mayer Rothschild (1777–1836) and Hannah W. Cohen (1783–1850). 

He was a member of the Rothschild banking family of England, closely connected to the Rothschild banking family of France. While he was in his thirties, he was injured in a hunting accident, after which he was rarely seen in public. 

== Career ==
He moved to Paris, France in 1850 to work in the banking business owned by his uncle, James Mayer Rothschild (1792–1868).

In 1853, he acquired the Château Brane Mouton, a vineyard in Pauillac in the Gironde département from a Paris banker named Thuret who had previously bought it from Baron Hector de Branne in 1830. Rothschild paid 1,175,000 francs for Brane-Mouton&#x27;s 65 acres (263,000 m2) of vineyards and renamed the estate, Château Mouton Rothschild. It would become one of the world&#x27;s best known winemakers.

In 1868, his uncle James acquired the neighboring Château Lafite vineyard. A prestigious first growth (premier cru) property more than three times the size of Chateau Mouton, it created a family rivalry. In the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855, Château Mouton was ranked second, something that upset its owner a great deal. In response, he composed the motto: &quot;&quot; (&quot;First I cannot be, second I do not choose to be, Mouton I am.&quot;), a hint on the apocryphal motto of the House of Rohan.

== Personal life ==
In 1842, he married Charlotte de Rothschild (1825–1899), the only daughter of James Mayer Rothschild.. They had the following children:
* Nathalie de Rothschild (1843–1843)
* James Edouard de Rothschild (1844–1881), married Laura Thérèse von Rothschild ( 1871)
* Mayer Albert de Rothschild (1846–1850)
* Arthur de Rothschild (1851–1903)

In 1856, Nathaniel and his wife purchased the property at 33 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré in Paris from Denis, duc Decrès. At the time it was rented to the Russian Embassy but when the lease ran out in 1864, he renovated the building and made it his city residence. Passed down to his son Arthur de Rothschild, he sold it in 1918 to the Cercle de l&#x27;Union interalliée. In 1878, Nathaniel bought the Abbaye des Vaux de Cernay in Cernay-la-Ville in the Vallée de Chevreuse, at the time only a ruins of a Cistercian abbey built in 1118. He and his wife undertook extensive restoration work and new construction to turn the lakeside property into a luxurious country home.

The property of Château Mouton Rothschild will pass to his son James Nathan and through him, to his great grandson Philippe de Rothschild

== Death and legacy ==
He died on 19 February 1870 in Paris, France.

After his death, his children and grandchildren showed little enthusiasm for the wine business. It would be 118 years later before Château Mouton, under the leadership of Nat&#x27;s great-grandson Philippe de Rothschild (1902–88), would become the only French vineyard to ever achieve reclassification to First Growth.

<text>In C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot; series of novels, Calormen () is a large country to the southeast of Narnia. Lewis probably derived its name from the Latin &quot;calor&quot;, meaning &quot;heat&quot;. When using the name as an adjective or an ethnonym, Lewis spelled the name with an &#x27;e&#x27; at the end: a Calormene () soldier; &quot;The Calormenes have dark faces and long beards.&quot;

Narnia and Calormen are separated by the country of Archenland and a large desert. In &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;, Calormen is described as being many times the size of its northern neighbours, and it is implied that its army is always either conquering more land or keeping down rebellions, in wars with which neither Narnia nor Archenland are involved. The border of the Calormene Empire extends from the Western Mountains to the Great Eastern Ocean. The Calormene capital is Tashbaan, a large walled city located on an island hill at the mouth of a river and close to the northern desert.

==History==
The country of Calormen was first mentioned by Lewis in a passing reference in chapter 2 of &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;, though in the first edition it was spelt &quot;Kalormen&quot;. He first wrote about Calormene characters in the subsequent &quot;Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;, though neither of these is their first chronological appearance in the series. They are presented with the following words: &quot;The Calormenes have dark faces and long beards. They wear flowing robes and orange-coloured turbans, and they are a wise, wealthy, courteous, cruel and ancient people&quot;. As narrated in that book, after the Telmarine kings cut Narnia off from the sea, the Lone Islands—though in theory remaining a Narnian possession—fell into the Calormene sphere of influence, becoming a major source of slaves for Calormen and adopting the Calormene Crescent as the islands&#x27; currency. After Caspian the Seafarer restored Narnian rule and abolished slavery in the islands, there was some apprehension of Calormen resorting to war to regain its influence there. The book&#x27;s plot then moves away and it remains unknown whether such a war took place. However, Lewis later placed Calormen at the focus of &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;—set a thousand years earlier, at the time of High King Peter.

The origins of Calormen and the Calormenes are not made clear during the &quot;Chronicles&quot;. According to the Narnian timeline published by Walter Hooper, Calormen was founded by Archen outlaws, who traveled over the Great Desert to the south some 24 years after Archenland&#x27;s founding. In an alternative theory, Calormen was founded by people accidentally crossing into Calormen from our world through a Middle Eastern portal (similar to the English wardrobe in The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe), which was subsequently lost or destroyed, preventing their return. The Calormenes speak a flowery version of the standard English favoured by both human and animal Narnians, which might support this argument; however, Jadis also speaks English. The reason for the ancient Arabian, Persian, Moorish, Mughal, and Ottoman Turkish aspects of Calormene culture, or the origin of their religion, was not satisfactorily explained, but stand in strong counterpoint to the largely European, Anglo and Greco-Roman (and Christian) aspects of Narnia and Archenland.

Throughout the times covered by the &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, Calormen and Narnia maintain an uneasy, albeit generally peaceable, coexistence. &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot; and &quot;The Last Battle&quot; contain plot lines that focus on Calormen, while some of the other books have peripheral references. In &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot; the main characters (one a young member of the Calormene nobility) escape from Calormen to Archenland and Narnia whilst the Calormene cavalry under Prince Rabadash attempts to invade Narnia and capture the Narnian Queen Susan for his bride. The rather small (200 horse) Calormene invasion force is rebuffed at the gates of the Kingdom of Archenland. In &quot;The Last Battle&quot;, there is a reference to King Erlian having fought a war with the Calormenes. King Tirian is—until the events narrated in the book—at peace with them, and some level of trade and travel exist between Narnia and Calormen. The Narnian King maintains a supply of Calormene armour and weapons for the purpose of conducting undercover operations in their country—suggesting a kind of cold war.

Calormenes are described as dark-skinned, with the men mostly bearded. Flowing robes, turbans and wooden shoes with an upturned point at the toe are common items of clothing, and the preferred weapon is the scimitar. Lavish palaces are present in the Calormene capital Tashbaan. The overall leitmotif of Calormene culture is portrayed as ornate to the point of ostentation. The people of Calormen are concerned with maintaining honour and precedent, often speaking in maxims and quoting their ancient poets. Veneration of elders and absolute deference to power are marks of Calormene society. Power and wealth determine class and social standing, and slavery is commonplace. The unit of currency is the Crescent. Narnians hold Calormenes in disdain for their treatment of animals and slaves. Conversely, Calormenes refer to the human inhabitants of Narnia as &quot;barbarians&quot;. All of this appears quite consistent with the Osmanli Turkish Ottoman Empire (1299-1923), its known and purported splendor, rigid class structure, and the always-volatile relationship with many of its European neighbors.

The ruler of Calormen is called the Tisroc and is believed by the Calormene people to have descended in a direct line from the god Tash, whom the people worship in addition to other gods and goddesses. The illustrations of Tash, a vulture headed god, by Pauline Baynes appear to be inspired by Hindu as opposed to Islamic imagery, with multiple arms and a distinct resemblance to the ancient Indian deity Garuda. Calormenes always follow a mention of the Tisroc with the phrase &quot;may he live forever&quot;. Ranking below the Tisroc are his sons (princes), a Grand Vizier, and the noble classes, who are addressed as Tarkaan (male) and Tarkheena (female). The nobility have a band of gold on their arm and their marriages are usually arranged at a young age. Beneath them are soldiers of the empire&#x27;s vast army, merchants, and the peasantry, with slaves being the lowest rung on the social ladder. The Calormene leaders are portrayed as quite war-like, and the Tisrocs generally seem to have a wish to conquer the &quot;barbarian&quot; lands to their north - to some degree deterred, however, by the magical reputation of the countries, their various rulers and their being known to be under the protection of Aslan. Significantly, the final, successful invasion of Narnia by the Calormene military, which precipitates the end of the Narnian universe, was conducted in close cooperation with the appearance of the false Aslan and the proclamation that Aslan and Tash are one and the same.

Calormene social and political institutions are depicted as essentially unchanged between the time of &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot; and &quot;The Last Battle&quot;—more than a thousand years, in which Narnia has profoundly changed several times. This is clearly an artifact of the order in which C. S. Lewis wrote and published the stories, with the two stories above and The Magician&#x27;s Nephew which also references ancient Mesopotamian civilisation in its depiction of Queen Jadis and Charn, appearing last three of the seven.

When at the end of &quot;The Last Battle&quot; the characters cross into the Real Narnia and find there the counterparts of all the places they had known in the destroyed Narnia, there is a reference to a counterpart of Calormen being also there to its south, complete with the capital Tashbaan—presumably without the nastier aspects of Calormene culture, but this is not discussed in detail.

==Tashbaan==
The capital of Calormen is the walled city of Tashbaan, situated on a river mouth located on the southern verge of the great desert dividing the empire from the northern states of Narnia and Archenland.

Tashbaan is described as one of the wonders of the world.
The city is a hot and crowded place, though with fine streets, magnificent palaces, and gardens. It is built on a natural slope, rising to the palace of the Tisroc and the great Temple of Tash at the pinnacle of the hill. The palace of the Tisroc is referred to as being magnificent beyond description and opens onto gardens that run right down to the river wall. Tashbaan is surrounded by a strong wall that rises out of the water and is reached by long bridges from both banks, providing the only place where crossing the great river of Calormen is possible for many miles. The banks of the river are lined with gardens and country houses. The Tombs of the Ancient Kings, believed by the Carlomenes to be haunted, lie directly across the river from Tashbaan, on the edge of the desert.

==Calormene Poetry==
The poetry of Calormen is prolix, sententious, and moralizing. Quotations from Calormen poets are often quoted as proverbs. These include such as the following:
Calormenes disparage Narnian poetry, contending that it is all about things like love and war and not about useful maxims, but when the Calormen-raised Cor and Aravis first hear Narnian (or Cor&#x27;s native Archenlandish) poetry they find it much more exciting. Calormen also prizes the art of story-telling, which, according to Lewis, forms part of the education of the nobility. The talking horse Bree, though not fond of most things Calormene, thoroughly enjoys a story told in Calormene style by Aravis. He also has the habit of rolling like inarticulate Calormene horses.

== Concepts of freedom and slavery ==
In &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;, Lewis uses the cultural settings of Narnia, Archenland, and Calormen to develop a theme of freedom in contrast to slavery. Lewis depicts the Calormene culture as one in which a primary guiding principle is that the weak must make way for the strong:

He also reveals the motivation for Calormene attempts to invade Archenland and, ultimately, Narnia, as a refusal to abide the thought of free countries so close to the border of the Calormene empire, as illustrated by this speech given by the Tisroc:

In contrast, the kings and queens of Narnia and Archenland, as rulers of free people, hold themselves responsible for the well-being of their subjects. As King Lune tells Shasta/Cor:
== Accusations of racism ==
C. S. Lewis has been accused of racism, particularly in his depiction of the Calormenes. In the &quot;Companion to Narnia&quot;, the Catholic theologian Paul F. Ford wrote &quot;C. S. Lewis was a man of his time and socioeconomic class. Like many English men of this era, Lewis was unconsciously but regrettably unsympathetic to things and people Middle Eastern. Thus he sometimes engages in exaggerated stereotyping in contrasting things Narnian and things Calormene. He intends this in a broadly comic way, almost vaudevillian. But in our post-September 11, 2001, world, he would, I am sure, want to reconsider this insensitivity.&quot; Outspoken atheist critic and novelist Philip Pullman has called the &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot; &quot;blatantly racist&quot; and in an interview with &quot;The Observer&quot;, criticised the film adaptation of &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; by saying the books contained &quot;a peevish blend of racist, misogynistic, and reactionary prejudice&quot;.

Calormenes live south of a desert, wear turbans and pointed shoes, their noblemen are called Tarkaans (similar to the medieval Central Asian title tarkhan), they are armed with scimitars, and their money is called &quot;crescents&quot;.

Of Lewis, Kyrie O&#x27;Connor writes: &quot;In his time, people thought it was amusing to make fun of other cultures. We don&#x27;t. Read the stories, ask questions, and remember that the person who wrote this story was altogether too human.&quot; Claims of racism can be seen as countered by Lewis&#x27;s positive portrayal of two Calormenes and the lack of racism shown to them by Narnian nobility. Lewis writes in &quot;The Last Battle&quot; that those who worship Tash and who are virtuous are in fact worshipping Aslan, and those who are immoral and who worship Aslan are in fact worshipping Tash:
== In foreign languages ==
In the Russian translation of the Narnia books, Calormen is known as &quot;Tarkhistan&quot; (Тархистан), as a reference to the Tarkaan nobles and its Turkish and Persian cultural influences.

<text>In computer science, cycle detection or cycle finding is the algorithmic problem of finding a cycle in a sequence of iterated function values.

For any function that maps a finite set to itself, and any initial value in , the sequence of iterated function values

:formula_1

must eventually use the same value twice: there must be some pair of distinct indices and such that . Once this happens, the sequence must continue periodically, by repeating the same sequence of values from to . Cycle detection is the problem of finding and , given and .

Several algorithms are known for finding cycles quickly and with little memory. Robert W. Floyd&#x27;s tortoise and hare algorithm moves two pointers at different speeds through the sequence of values until they both point to equal values. Alternatively, Brent&#x27;s algorithm is based on the idea of exponential search. Both Floyd&#x27;s and Brent&#x27;s algorithms use only a constant number of memory cells, and take a number of function evaluations that is proportional to the distance from the start of the sequence to the first repetition. Several other algorithms trade off larger amounts of memory for fewer function evaluations.

The applications of cycle detection include testing the quality of pseudorandom number generators and cryptographic hash functions, computational number theory algorithms, detection of infinite loops in computer programs and periodic configurations in cellular automata, automated shape analysis of linked list data structures, and detection of deadlocks for transactions management in DBMS.

==Example==

The figure shows a function that maps the set to itself. If one starts from and repeatedly applies , one sees the sequence of values
The cycle in this value sequence is .

==Definitions==

Let be any finite set, be any endofunction from to itself, and be any element of . For any , let . Let be the smallest index such that the value reappears infinitely often within the sequence of values , and let (the loop length) be the smallest positive integer such that . The cycle detection problem is the task of finding and .

One can view the same problem graph-theoretically, by constructing a functional graph (that is, a directed graph in which each vertex has a single outgoing edge) the vertices of which are the elements of and the edges of which map an element to the corresponding function value, as shown in the figure. The set of vertices reachable from starting vertex form a subgraph with a shape resembling the Greek letter rho (): a path of length from to a cycle of vertices.

Practical cycle-detection algorithms do not find and exactly. They usually find lower and upper bounds for the start of the cycle, and a more detailed search of the range must be performed if the exact value of is needed. Also, most algorithms do not guarantee to find directly, but may find some multiple . (Continuing the search for an additional steps, where is the smallest prime divisor of , will either find the true or prove that .)

==Computer representation==
Except in toy examples like the above, will not be specified as a table of values. Such a table implies space complexity, and if that is permissible, an associative array mapping to will detect the first repeated value. Rather, a cycle detection algorithm is given a black box for generating the sequence , and the task is to find and using very little memory.

The black box might consist of an implementation of the recurrence function , but it might also store additional internal state to make the computation more efficient. Although must be true &quot;in principle&quot;, this might be expensive to compute directly; the function could be defined in terms of the discrete logarithm of or some other difficult-to-compute property which can only be practically computed in terms of additional information. In such cases, the number of black boxes required becomes a figure of merit distinguishing the algorithms.

A second reason to use one of these algorithms is that they are pointer algorithms which do no operations on elements of other than testing for equality. An associative array implementation requires computing a hash function on the elements of , or ordering them. But cycle detection can be applied in cases where neither of these are possible.

The classic example is Pollard&#x27;s rho algorithm for integer factorization, which searches for a factor of a given number by looking for values and which are equal modulo &quot;without knowing in advance.&quot; This is done by computing the greatest common divisor of the difference with a known multiple of , namely . If the gcd is non-trivial (neither 1 nor ), then the value is a proper factor of , as desired. If is not prime, it must have at least one factor , and by the birthday paradox, a random function has an expected cycle length (modulo ) of .

==Algorithms==

If the input is given as a subroutine for calculating , the cycle detection problem may be trivially solved using only function applications, simply by computing the sequence of values and using a data structure such as a hash table to store these values and test whether each subsequent value has already been stored. However, the space complexity of this algorithm is proportional to , unnecessarily large. Additionally, to implement this method as a pointer algorithm would require applying the equality test to each pair of values, resulting in quadratic time overall. Thus, research in this area has concentrated on two goals: using less space than this naive algorithm, and finding pointer algorithms that use fewer equality tests.
===Floyd&#x27;s tortoise and hare===

Floyd&#x27;s cycle-finding algorithm is a pointer algorithm that uses only two pointers, which move through the sequence at different speeds. It is also called the &quot;tortoise and the hare algorithm&quot;, alluding to Aesop&#x27;s fable of The Tortoise and the Hare.

The algorithm is named after Robert W. Floyd, who was credited with its invention by Donald Knuth. However, the algorithm does not appear in Floyd&#x27;s published work, and this may be a misattribution: Floyd describes algorithms for listing all simple cycles in a directed graph in a 1967 paper, but this paper does not describe the cycle-finding problem in functional graphs that is the subject of this article. In fact, Knuth&#x27;s statement (in 1969), attributing it to Floyd, without citation, is the first known appearance in print, and it thus may be a folk theorem, not attributable to a single individual.

The key insight in the algorithm is as follows. If there is a cycle, then, for any integers and , , where is the length of the loop to be found, is the index of the first element of the cycle, and is a whole integer representing the number of loops. Based on this, it can then be shown that for some if and only if (if in the cycle, then there exists some such that , which implies that ; and if there are some and such that , then and ). Thus, the algorithm only needs to check for repeated values of this special form, one twice as far from the start of the sequence as the other, to find a period of a repetition that is a multiple of . Once is found, the algorithm retraces the sequence from its start to find the first repeated value in the sequence, using the fact that divides and therefore that . Finally, once the value of is known it is trivial to find the length of the shortest repeating cycle, by searching for the first position for which .

The algorithm thus maintains two pointers into the given sequence, one (the tortoise) at , and the other (the hare) at . At each step of the algorithm, it increases by one, moving the tortoise one step forward and the hare two steps forward in the sequence, and then compares the sequence values at these two pointers. The smallest value of for which the tortoise and hare point to equal values is the desired value .

The following Python code shows how this idea may be implemented as an algorithm.
def floyd(f, x0) -&gt; (int, int):
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Floyd&#x27;s cycle detection algorithm.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 # Main phase of algorithm: finding a repetition x_i = x_2i.
 # The hare moves twice as quickly as the tortoise and
 # the distance between them increases by 1 at each step.
 # Eventually they will both be inside the cycle and then,
 # at some point, the distance between them will be
 # divisible by the period λ.
 tortoise = f(x0) # f(x0) is the element/node next to x0.
 hare = f(f(x0))
 while tortoise != hare:
 tortoise = f(tortoise)
 hare = f(f(hare))
 # At this point the tortoise position, ν, which is also equal
 # to the distance between hare and tortoise, is divisible by
 # the period λ. So hare moving in cycle one step at a time, 
 # and tortoise (reset to x0) moving towards the cycle, will 
 # intersect at the beginning of the cycle. Because the 
 # distance between them is constant at 2ν, a multiple of λ,
 # they will agree as soon as the tortoise reaches index μ.

 # Find the position μ of first repetition. 
 mu = 0
 tortoise = x0
 while tortoise != hare:
 tortoise = f(tortoise)
 hare = f(hare) # Hare and tortoise move at same speed
 mu += 1
 # Find the length of the shortest cycle starting from x_μ
 # The hare moves one step at a time while tortoise is still.
 # lam is incremented until λ is found.
 lam = 1
 hare = f(tortoise)
 while tortoise != hare:
 hare = f(hare)
 lam += 1
 return lam, mu
This code only accesses the sequence by storing and copying pointers, function evaluations, and equality tests; therefore, it qualifies as a pointer algorithm. The algorithm uses operations of these types, and storage space.

===Brent&#x27;s algorithm===

Richard P. Brent described an alternative cycle detection algorithm that, like the tortoise and hare algorithm, requires only two pointers into the sequence. However, it is based on a different principle: searching for the smallest power of two that is larger than both and . For , the algorithm compares with each subsequent sequence value up to the next power of two, stopping when it finds a match. It has two advantages compared to the tortoise and hare algorithm: it finds the correct length of the cycle directly, rather than needing to search for it in a subsequent stage, and its steps involve only one evaluation of the function rather than three.

The following Python code shows how this technique works in more detail.

def brent(f, x0) -&gt; (int, int):
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Brent&#x27;s cycle detection algorithm.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 # main phase: search successive powers of two
 power = lam = 1
 tortoise = x0
 hare = f(x0) # f(x0) is the element/node next to x0.
 # this assumes there is a cycle; otherwise this loop won&#x27;t terminate
 while tortoise != hare:
 if power == lam: # time to start a new power of two?
 tortoise = hare
 power *= 2
 lam = 0
 hare = f(hare)
 lam += 1

 # Find the position of the first repetition of length λ
 tortoise = hare = x0
 for i in range(lam):
 # range(lam) produces a list with the values 0, 1, ... , lam-1
 hare = f(hare)
 # The distance between the hare and tortoise is now λ.

 # Next, the hare and tortoise move at same speed until they agree
 mu = 0
 while tortoise != hare:
 tortoise = f(tortoise)
 hare = f(hare)
 mu += 1
 return lam, mu
Like the tortoise and hare algorithm, this is a pointer algorithm that uses tests and function evaluations and storage space. It is not difficult to show that the number of function evaluations can never be higher than for Floyd&#x27;s algorithm. Brent claims that, on average, his cycle finding algorithm runs around 36% more quickly than Floyd&#x27;s and that it speeds up the Pollard rho algorithm by around 24%. He also performs an average case analysis for a randomized version of the algorithm in which the sequence of indices traced by the slower of the two pointers is not the powers of two themselves, but rather a randomized multiple of the powers of two. Although his main intended application was in integer factorization algorithms, Brent also discusses applications in testing pseudorandom number generators.

===Gosper&#x27;s algorithm===
R. W. Gosper&#x27;s algorithm finds the period formula_2, and the lower and upper bound of the starting point, formula_3 and formula_4, of the first cycle. The difference between the lower and upper bound is of the same order as the period, i.e. formula_5.

The algorithm maintains an array of tortoises formula_6. For each formula_7:
* For each formula_8 compare formula_7 to formula_6.
* If formula_11, a cycle has been detected, of length formula_12
* If no match is found, set formula_13, where formula_14 is the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of formula_15. I.e. the greatest power of 2 which divides formula_15.

If it is inconvenient to vary the number of comparisons as formula_17 increases, you may initialize all of the formula_18, but must then return formula_19 if formula_11 while formula_21.

====Advantages====

The main features of Gosper&#x27;s algorithm are that it is economical in space, very economical in evaluations of the generator function, and always finds the exact cycle length (never a multiple). The cost is a large number of equality comparisons. It could be roughly described as a concurrent version of Brent&#x27;s algorithm. While Brent&#x27;s algorithm uses a single tortoise, repositioned every time the hare passes a power of two, Gosper&#x27;s algorithm uses several tortoises (several previous values are saved), which are roughly exponentially spaced. According to the note in HAKMEM item 132, this algorithm will detect repetition before the third occurrence of any value, i.e. the cycle will be iterated at most twice. HAKMEM also states that it is sufficient to store formula_22 previous values; however, this only offers a saving if we know &quot;a priori&quot; that formula_2 is significantly smaller than formula_24. The standard implementations store formula_25 values. For example, assume the function values are 32-bit integers, so formula_26 and formula_27 Then Gosper&#x27;s algorithm will find the cycle after less than formula_28 function evaluations (in fact, the most possible is formula_29), while consuming the space of 33 values (each value being a 32-bit integer).

====Complexity====

Upon the formula_17-th evaluation of the generator function, the algorithm compares the generated value with formula_31 previous values; observe that formula_17 goes up to at least formula_33 and at most formula_28. Therefore, the time complexity of this algorithm is formula_35. Since it stores formula_36 values, its space complexity is formula_37. This is under the usual transdichotomous model, assumed throughout this article, in which the size of the function values is constant. Without this assumption, we know it requires formula_38 space to store formula_33 distinct values, so the overall space complexity is formula_40

===Time–space tradeoffs===
A number of authors have studied techniques for cycle detection that use more memory than Floyd&#x27;s and Brent&#x27;s methods, but detect cycles more quickly. In general these methods store several previously-computed sequence values, and test whether each new value equals one of the previously-computed values. In order to do so quickly, they typically use a hash table or similar data structure for storing the previously-computed values, and therefore are not pointer algorithms: in particular, they usually cannot be applied to Pollard&#x27;s rho algorithm. Where these methods differ is in how they determine which values to store. Following Nivasch, we survey these techniques briefly.

*Brent already describes variations of his technique in which the indices of saved sequence values are powers of a number other than two. By choosing to be a number close to one, and storing the sequence values at indices that are near a sequence of consecutive powers of , a cycle detection algorithm can use a number of function evaluations that is within an arbitrarily small factor of the optimum .
*Sedgewick, Szymanski, and Yao provide a method that uses memory cells and requires in the worst case only formula_41 function evaluations, for some constant , which they show to be optimal. The technique involves maintaining a numerical parameter , storing in a table only those positions in the sequence that are multiples of , and clearing the table and doubling whenever too many values have been stored.
*Several authors have described &quot;distinguished point&quot; methods that store function values in a table based on a criterion involving the values, rather than (as in the method of Sedgewick et al.) based on their positions. For instance, values equal to zero modulo some value might be stored. More simply, Nivasch credits D. P. Woodruff with the suggestion of storing a random sample of previously seen values, making an appropriate random choice at each step so that the sample remains random.
*Nivasch describes an algorithm that does not use a fixed amount of memory, but for which the expected amount of memory used (under the assumption that the input function is random) is logarithmic in the sequence length. An item is stored in the memory table, with this technique, when no later item has a smaller value. As Nivasch shows, the items with this technique can be maintained using a stack data structure, and each successive sequence value need be compared only to the top of the stack. The algorithm terminates when the repeated sequence element with smallest value is found. Running the same algorithm with multiple stacks, using random permutations of the values to reorder the values within each stack, allows a time–space tradeoff similar to the previous algorithms. However, even the version of this algorithm with a single stack is not a pointer algorithm, due to the comparisons needed to determine which of two values is smaller.

Any cycle detection algorithm that stores at most values from the input sequence must perform at least formula_42 function evaluations.

==Applications==

Cycle detection has been used in many applications.
*Determining the cycle length of a pseudorandom number generator is one measure of its strength. This is the application cited by Knuth in describing Floyd&#x27;s method. Brent describes the results of testing a linear congruential generator in this fashion; its period turned out to be significantly smaller than advertised. For more complex generators, the sequence of values in which the cycle is to be found may not represent the output of the generator, but rather its internal state.
*Several number-theoretic algorithms are based on cycle detection, including Pollard&#x27;s rho algorithm for integer factorization and his related kangaroo algorithm for the discrete logarithm problem.
*In cryptographic applications, the ability to find two distinct values &quot;x&quot;&quot;μ&quot;−1 and &quot;x&quot;&quot;λ&quot;+&quot;μ&quot;−1 mapped by some cryptographic function &quot;ƒ&quot; to the same value &quot;x&quot;&quot;μ&quot; may indicate a weakness in &quot;ƒ&quot;. For instance, Quisquater and Delescaille apply cycle detection algorithms in the search for a message and a pair of Data Encryption Standard keys that map that message to the same encrypted value; Kaliski, Rivest, and Sherman also use cycle detection algorithms to attack DES. The technique may also be used to find a collision in a cryptographic hash function.
*Cycle detection may be helpful as a way of discovering infinite loops in certain types of computer programs.
*Periodic configurations in cellular automaton simulations may be found by applying cycle detection algorithms to the sequence of automaton states.
*Shape analysis of linked list data structures is a technique for verifying the correctness of an algorithm using those structures. If a node in the list incorrectly points to an earlier node in the same list, the structure will form a cycle that can be detected by these algorithms. In Common Lisp, the S-expression printer, under control of the codice_1 variable, detects circular list structure and prints it compactly.
*Teske describes applications in computational group theory: determining the structure of an Abelian group from a set of its generators. The cryptographic algorithms of Kaliski et al. may also be viewed as attempting to infer the structure of an unknown group.
* briefly mentions an application to computer simulation of celestial mechanics, which she attributes to William Kahan. In this application, cycle detection in the phase space of an orbital system may be used to determine whether the system is periodic to within the accuracy of the simulation.
*In Mandelbrot Set fractal generation some performance techniques are used to speed up the image generation. One of them is called &quot;period checking&quot;, which consists of finding the cycles in a point orbit. This article describes the &quot;&quot; technique. You can find another explanation here. Some cycle detection algorithms have to be implemented in order to implement this technique.

<text>Lambert Cadwalader (December 1742 – September 13, 1823) was an American merchant and leader in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. He fought in the Revolutionary War, then represented New Jersey in the Continental Congress and the U.S. Congress.

==Early life==
Lambert was born in Trenton, New Jersey, to Doctor Thomas and Hannah (née Lambert) Cadwalader. By 1750, his family had returned to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he attended Dr. Allison&#x27;s Academy.

In 1757, he entered the College of Philadelphia (later the University of Pennsylvania), but did not graduate. Instead, he went into business with his brother John Cadwalader.

==Career==
The brothers&#x27; business was a success and they became more active in civic affairs, both in Philadelphia and the wider field of the colony of Pennsylvania. They signed the non-importation agreement in 1765, to support the boycott of English merchants. Lambert became a particularly outspoken opponent of the Stamp Act and later measures. In 1768 he was elected to the American Philosophical Society. In 1774, he has elected to the Provincial Assembly, and, in Philadelphia, he was appointed to the city&#x27;s Committee of Correspondence.

===Revolutionary years===
In 1775, Lambert returned again to the colonial Assembly. He also advanced in the militia, and was named captain of one of the companies raised in the city. Then, in the spring of 1776, he played a prominent role in the call for a state Constitutional Convention. He was named as a delegate, but attended only the first few meetings, as military duty called him away.

In January 1776, Cadwalader had been promoted to lieutenant colonel of the 3rd Pennsylvania Battalion of the Continental Army. Late in the summer, he was in New York to aid that city&#x27;s defense. He began work on building the defenses at Fort Washington in August. After the Battle of Brooklyn, he worked with George Washington to set up defenses on the Brooklyn Heights, but they were forced to withdraw to Manhattan on August 30, because the British had overwhelming numbers.

The 3rd Pennsylvania returned to the defense of Fort Washington. At the beginning of the battle for the Fort, on November 15, Cadwalader was holding the old line on the Harlem Heights. Facing two British regiments, with three more landed to their rear, the Americans were forced to withdraw to the fort. When Colonel Magaw surrendered the fort on the next day, Cadwalader was among those taken prisoner. He was soon released, after giving his parole to British General Howe. Lambert&#x27;s quick release was partly due to the consideration that his father, Dr. Thomas Cadwalader, had shown to General Richard Prescott as a prisoner of war in Philadelphia in 1776.

Early in 1777, Cadwalader was named colonel and commander of the 3rd Battalion, now called the 4th Pennsylvania Regiment. He declined to take up the assignment because he was on parole and could not serve until exchanged. He was carried on the rolls for almost two years, but a suitable exchange was never arranged. Finally, after officer exchanges broke down, Washington accepted his resignation on January 29, 1777.

When the British occupied Philadelphia in 1777, he withdrew to his father&#x27;s property near Trenton, New Jersey. This home, called &quot;Greenwood&quot;, would be his residence for the rest of his life.

===Later life===
In 1784, New Jersey selected him as a delegate to the Continental Congress. He would serve there for the remaining life of that institution, being returned each year until 1787. When the new government was established for the United States, Cadwalader was a Federalist in national politics. He was elected to the U.S. Congress twice, in 1788 and 1792.

Although eligible, Cadwalader did not join The Society of the Cincinnati as an original member when it was established in 1783. He did however qualify for membership and became eligible for representation by a living descendant after the &quot;Rule of 1854&quot; was adopted by the Society as a way to revive the membership.

==Personal life==

In 1793, in his early 50s, Cadwalader married Mary McCall (1764–1848), the daughter of Archibald and Judith (née Kemble) McCall. They had one child:

* Thomas McCall Cadwalader (1795–1873), who married Maria Charlotte Gouverneur (1801–1867). Maria was the sister of Samuel Laurence Gouverneur (1799–1865) and the niece of Elizabeth Kortright and U.S. President James Monroe.

He died at Greenwood, in Trenton, Mercer County, New Jersey on September 13, 1823, and is buried in the Friends Burying Ground at Trenton.

<text>Keith Fullerton Whitman (born May 29, 1973) is an American electronic musician who has recorded albums influenced by many genres, including ambient music, drill and bass, and krautrock. He records and performs using many aliases, of which the best-known is Hrvatski (the Croatian word for &quot;Croatian&quot;). His works under the Hrvatski moniker mainly fell under the &#x27;drill and bass&#x27; subgenre of IDM, and were his main musical outlet in the mid-to-late 1990s. Other solo aliases include &quot;ASCIII&quot; and &quot;Anonymous&quot;. Keith was in many bands in the 1990s, including &quot;El-Ron&quot;, &quot;The Liver Sadness&quot;, &quot;Sheket/Trabant&quot;, &quot;The Finger Lakes&quot; and &quot;Gai/Jin&quot;.

Fullerton Whitman started recording using his own name in 2001, and most of his work recorded today is under that name. His brother, former MIT scientist Brian Alexander Whitman and co-founder of The Echo Nest, is also an electronic musician and sound artist performing under name &quot;Blitter&quot;.

==Electronic music career==
Whitman studied computer music at Berklee College of Music, where he was exposed to modern electronic music composition and synthesis. Whitman says that before this he was initially drawn to making music by listening to the radio in the New York city suburbs in the 1980s. His moniker &quot;ASCIII&quot; has released music distributed with an academic journal. His studio and live setup usually consists of a PowerBook running Max/MSP or Logic Pro, and other analogue instruments, such as guitars, ouds and synthesizers.

Whitman has released albums on labels such as Planet Mu, Kranky, Carpark Records as well on his own Entschuldigen and (now defunct) Reckankreuzungsklankewerkzeuge labels.

In 2013, Whitman released &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; on SoundCloud: a 12-hour-long audio project developed from samples of pop songs from Whitman&#x27;s youth. Sample are snipped out, slowed to half speed and then run through Whitman&#x27;s signature array of boxes and generators to create an &quot;automatic enhancement&quot; of the original tune.

Whitman currently runs Mimaroglu Music Sales which offers distribution of an extensive collection of avant-garde music.

<text>In the Russian Federation, a city of federal importance (), also known as a [[federal city]], is a city that has a status of both an inhabited locality and a constituent federal subject. Russia has three federal cities: Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and Sevastopol, which was annexed in 2014 but remains internationally recognised as part of Ukraine.

Moscow and Saint Petersburg are the largest cities in the country: Moscow is the national capital and Saint Petersburg is a former Russian capital and an important port city by the Baltic Sea. Currently, Sevastopol houses the Sevastopol Naval Base, the main port of the Russian Black Sea Fleet.

<text>Daklon (born Joseph Levy; 6 April 1944) is an Israeli singer. He was born in Tel Aviv&#x27;s Kerem Hateimanim neighborhood, the son of Jewish immigrants from the Shar&#x27;ab region in Yemen.

Daklon explains the source of his nickname: &quot;In those days everyone in the Kerem had a nickname. Your given name was a form of identification . As a kid I was quite short and skinny, (Hebrew: דק, &quot;dak&quot;; &quot;daq&quot;), and so, they called me &quot;Daklon&quot;.&quot; He started his musical career as an 11-year-old when his teacher sent him to do a piece for a religious music radio show.

==Career==
At the end of the 1950s Daklon&#x27;s professional career took off. He was first inspired to take his music to the professional level by the famous Moroccan-born Israeli singer, Joe Amar. Daklon had also translated famous Greek and Hindi songs into Hebrew in the 1960s, at the beginning of his career. Since the 1960s, he has been performing with Haim Moshe and Avihu Medina. He has produced more than 35 albums to date.

Daklon music draws on Jewish, Middle-Eastern and Yemenite Jewish poetry, psalms, Bible, and ancient Jewish hymns.

<doc id="670309" wikidata="Q941864" url="?curid=670309" title="White-shouldered ibis">
<text>The white-shouldered ibis (Pseudibis davisoni) is a large species of bird in the family Threskiornithidae. It is native to small regions of Southeast Asia, and is considered to be one of the most threatened bird species on this part of the continent.

==Taxonomy and systematics== 
The white-shouldered ibis was first described by Hume (1875), who originally named the species &quot;Geronticus davisoni&quot; after his bird collector William Ruxton Davison. Based on this species’ observed similarity with the black ibis (Elliot, 1877), the two species were placed in the same genus. In the more recent past, this ibis has often been classified as a subspecies of the black ibis; but is currently recognised as a separate species.

==Description==
The adult stands 60–85 cm tall, with males being slightly larger and having slightly longer bills than females. Its only available biometrics are measurements from a single unsexed specimen originating from the 19th century, which include a wing length of 419mm, culmen length of 197mm, tarsus length of 83mm and tail length of 229mm. The plumage is brownish-black, with glossy blue-black wings and tail, and a bare slate-black head which has also been reported as blue or white. A conspicuous neck collar comprising a bluish-white band of bare skin which is broader at the back and narrower at the front extends from the chin around to the nape at the base of the skull. The pale blue is most easily detectable at close range, although this collar may sometimes be completely white. The legs are dull red, the iris is orange-red, and the large de-curved bill is yellowish-grey.

The white-shouldered ibis owes its name to the clear white patch visible on the upper part of the neck and chin in some individuals. These white patches may appear as “white shoulders” in flight. In flight, it is also identified by its conspicuous white wing patch, which is visible only as a thin white line when the wings are closed. 
The white-shouldered ibis is morphologically similar to its Indian congener the black or red-naped ibis &quot;Pseudibis papillosa&quot;, but lacks the red tubercles on the nape; and is slightly larger, more robust and has a longer neck and legs. The tail also appears shorter and spreads downwards, not straight as in the black ibis.

The juvenile has dull-brown plumage with a tuft of brown feathers on the bluish-white nape, a grey-brown iris, pale yellow legs and dull white feet.

Vocalizations generally consist of loud, mournful calls that have been described as “weird and unearthly screams”. The hoarse calls of territorial individuals have been described as “errrrh” or “errrrrroh”. It also utters honking screams of “errrrh owk owk owk owk owk” and more subdued “ohhaaa ohhaaa” and “errrrrah”. It makes a loud, harsh “klioh klioh” call during copulation, resembling that of the black woodpecker.

==Distribution and habitat==

This southeast Asian ibis was once much more widespread than presently. It used to extend throughout Southeast Asia from Myanmar to Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and north into Yuman in China. The current population is very small and its distribution highly fragmented, being restricted to northern and eastern Cambodia, southern Vietnam, extreme southern Laos and East Kalimantan.

Cambodia, the species&#x27; largest stronghold, holds an estimated 85-95% of the global population. The largest known Cambodian white-shouldered ibis subpopulation resides in Western Siem Pang Important Bird Area (minimally 346 individuals). Other sites in Cambodia that hold considerable numbers of white-shouldered ibis include Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary, Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary and the central section of the Mekong River. It is now functionally extinct from Thailand, Myanmar, and southern China; and very scarce in Indonesian Borneo and southern Laos. Thailand was once the stronghold for this species, but no official records of its occurrence have been made here since 1937.

The white-shouldered ibis is a lowland specialist and has been observed in various habitats including dry dipterocarp forest, margins of seasonal pools (these pools are known locally as “trapaengs”) interspersed within forest, fallow rice fields, shrubby grasslands, forested lakesides and river margins, gravel and shingle banks at low river levels, sandbanks at wide rivers and, on the Sekong river, sandy islands. At least in Indochina, dry dipterocarp forest seems to be the most important habitat. However, one field study of the local population around the Mekong River in Cambodia found that the ibises nested both in flooded riverine forest and dry inland dipterocarp forest; which was a combination of utilised habitats not observed for any other population.

This species appears to capitalize on traditional local agricultural practices that create and maintain its preferred microhabitats, specifically through grazing and trampling of forest vegetation by livestock such as domestic cattle and water buffalo to create clearings as space for preferential foraging habitat; and through wallowing of ungulates in mud to create seasonal pools. This ibis&#x27;s reliance on human-mediated activity may be especially strong considering both the marked local population declines of many wild ungulates in the white-shouldered ibis&#x27;s range in the past few decades and the local extinction of many other species such as the Asian elephant; although wild boar may still be important contributors to creating seasonal pools through wallowing. These anthropogenic processes of creating and nurturing suitable habitats may be especially important in the early dry season when such habitat conditions are limited. Anthropogenic burning practices in dipterocarp forest may also have a similar role to grazing for creating suitable clearings.

==Ecology==
===Feeding===

Unlike other sympatric wading birds, the white-shouldered ibis is largely terrestrial in its foraging strategy and has not been seen foraging in open water. It preferentially forages in muddy seasonal pools covered with short vegetation less than 25 cm high, on the ground in dry dipterocarp forest preferentially with bare underlying substrate, in fallow rice fields, and more occasionally in river channels with large extents of mud and sand. However, it forages almost exclusively at seasonal pools during the breeding season, probably due to high densities of refuge-seeking prey residing between the frequent cracks in the dry mud and hence high availability of food to feed to chicks. With its highly maneuverable, penetrative downcurved bill, the white-shouldered ibis is well adapted to probing into the cracks potentially harbouring concealed prey. This specific bill morphology gives the ibis an adaptive feeding advantage over other sympatric waders with straight bills, and is therefore commonly followed and by kleptoparasitic species such as cattle egrets and Chinese pond herons. Individuals feed singly, in pairs, or in family groups (flocks of up to 14 being reported). Flock size is much larger in the wet (non-breeding) than the dry (non-breeding) season.

Its diet comprises small invertebrates such as large worms, mole crickets, leeches, insect and beetle larvae; amphibians such as Paddy Frogs &quot;Fejervarya limnocharis&quot; and frogs of &quot;Microhyla&quot; species; and eels. Although amphibians appear to form the bulk of the diet, the main prey taken at a given place or time may depend on the texture of the underlying substrate. For example, intake rate of invertebrate prey has been found to be significantly higher in saturated than moist or dry grounds; and amphibian intake rate significantly greater in dry than moist, and moist than saturated grounds. However, dry substrate appears to be most favourable, probably because of the high level of available biomass constituted by large amphibians (Wright et al. 2013b). Incidentally, there are also unsubstantiated claims of this ibis feeding on fruit.

After rainfall during the wet season, individuals increasingly use forests and fields as foraging ground instead of pools, probably because of dilution of prey density in the water at pool margins. Additionally, swamp eels and crabs which are primarily aquatic and occur in saturated substrate have not been identified in white shouldered-ibis diet because these potential prey could easily evade predation by burrowing or swimming away.

Breeding pairs are demanding in their food requirements, with each pair in Cambodia estimated to utilise nearly two thirds of the total amphibian biomass at a given time for a water hole over an entire breeding season. Therefore, breeding pairs would need to use multiple waterholes for adequate sustenance over the breeding season to avoid prey depletion at one pool, and the supposedly high resultant intraspecific competition would lead to large dispersion of the breeding population. Therefore, any conservation recommendations for this species would need to consider a landscape scale approach.

===Breeding===
The white-shouldered ibis is a solitary breeder. In its Cambodian stronghold, it nests December–April during the mid- to late dry season November – May in dipterocarp tree canopies. This breeding strategy contrasts with those in other sympatric water bird species which nest during the wet season or from the late wet to mid- dry seasons. However, the dry-season breeding in Cambodia is probably synchronized with water drawdown in seasonal pools because of high density of amphibian prey taking refuge in the cracks in the dry mud at pool margins; thereby increasing the potential food availability for chicks and breeding adults. Different breeding seasons have been reported elsewhere in its range; with February–March in Myanmar when it still persisted here, September–December in East Kalimantan, and late August–December in Borneo, with copulation observed in February in this region.

It builds large nests 10-25m aboveground, composed of twigs and fresh leaves, usually in emergent trees such as Koompasia excels as in Borneo. Both partners continue to add nesting material throughout the breeding season and the same nests may be used in successive years. It also more occasionally uses abandoned raptor nests. The clutch contains 2-4 eggs, which are pale blue and hatch asynchronously. The eggs are incubated for 28–31 days by the female. Available reported egg measurements are 61.0-68.2mm in length and 43.9-46.7mm in width. The nestling period from hatching to fledging lasts 26–40 days.

===Other behaviour===
In contrast to their solitary breeding during the dry season, white-shouldered ibises become gregarious in the wet season July–October (non-breeding season); when they roost communally in trees. During the wet season, large congregations of white-shouldered ibis (up to 185 individuals at a time have been noted) have also been observed foraging on open terrestrial habitats such as abandoned paddy fields and less frequently at seasonal pools with higher water levels than during the dry season (during breeding).

The white-shouldered ibis is considered sedentary, but some small movements of just over 5 km between roosting and foraging grounds may occur during the wet season. During the wet season in Cambodia, there is considerable movement from pools and wet ground in the dipterocarp forest towards drier forest ground, probably due to easy accessibility of terrestrial invertebrate prey compared to evasive amphibians at the pools. On Borneo, white-shouldered ibises move along large rivers such as the Mahakam in response to large fluctuations in water levels and hence spatiotemporal variations of exposed river banks that serve as suitable feeding grounds. Additionally, large-scale forest fires in East Kalimantan induced by the El Nino Southern Oscillation in the mid-1990s caused large-scale habitat destruction, leading to appreciable movements of individuals into unburnt forest stretches and thereby resulting in a more aggregated local population distribution.

==Threats and survival==

The white-shouldered ibis is considered one of the most threatened birds of SE Asia. The largest threats to populations of this species are habitat conversion such as wetland drainage for agricultural developments such as plantations, unsustainable rural development, changing land management through land concessions, and infrastructural developments. In the last case for example, the relatively large subpopulations in Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary and at the unprotected section of the Mekong River could be threatened with proposed dams and encroaching human settlement. Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary is also an example region particularly threatened by economic land concessions, through which extensive development could substantially reduce suitable habitat.

The majority of roosting individuals censused in Cambodia (where the largest known populations occur) during the wet season (about three quarters) have been found to occur outside protected areas, revealing an unfortunate spatial mismatch between important roosting sites and these protected areas. This may be because most protected areas are situated far from human settlement; and given the ibis&#x27;s synanthropic nature (reliant on humans for creating suitable microhabitats), this bird is likely to occur relatively close to settlements; whereby its association with humans may also make it more vulnerable to hunting. Roosting of white shouldered ibises near to or within Economic Land Concessions will likely be severely affected by loss of foraging habitat and human exploitation.

Further, the population at the Mekong River may be particularly vulnerable to human exploitation because the ibis&#x27;s use of both riverine and dryland forest in this region, thereby potentially exposing it to more human nest exploiters (various workers in the inland forest, and fishers on the river). This ibis may also be in potential competition with humans during amphibian and swamp eel harvesting during the dry season.
Alongside direct habitat loss through land development, the white-shouldered ibis&#x27;s habitat could also be threatened indirectly through modern agricultural mechanization to replace traditional keeping of domestic ungulates that graze and trample on underlying vegetation and wallow in mud to maintain forest clearings and seasonal pools as important foraging ground for ibis. The potentially adverse agricultural changes may be driven by the increasing profitability of mechanised farming. The hypothesis concerning the importance of ungulates to ibises in creating suitable habitats has been supported in exclosure experiments which show increased vegetation height and cover in exclosures fenced to bar ungulates compared to unfenced controls. Therefore, the marked decline of traditional farming livelihood practices potentially beneficial to white-shouldered ibis could lead to increased vegetation growth beside pools in clearings, and thereby render these sites unsuitable foraging ground for this ibis. This may be especially likely considering the local extinction or dramatic decline of many wild ungulate species whose role in ibis habitat creation and maintenance has been largely taken over by human-reared ungulates with equivalent functions.

Opportunistic exploitation of nests by humans for food through taking eggs and chicks presents another potential threat. Although human exploitation has been identified as a cause of nest failure, humans are more likely to exploit nests in the late nestling stage; and given that most nest failures have been noted to occur in egg and early nestling stages, natural predation is a more likely cause. Nest guarding schemes in Western Siem Pang have been implemented to investigate chief causes of nest failure, and no significant difference in nest failure has been found between guarded and unguarded control nests; suggesting that natural causes of mortality are more likely. Counterintuitively, conservation interventions to protect nests may disturb the nests so as to increase egg and nestling mortality. Such nest guarding schemes have also faced societal problems.

A potential natural predator of white-shouldered ibis young is the southern jungle crow &quot;Corvus macrorhynchos&quot;, one individual of which was once observed to remove all eggs of a clutch in the absence of parents, and another of which predated a newly hatched chick. The ibis may also be threatened by mammalian predators such as civets and yellow-throated marten &quot;Martes flavigula&quot;, although such predators may be more abundant farther from human settlement due to hunting pressure on these mammals. Despite increased likelihood of exploitation of nests closer to settlement, these nests may therefore receive increased indirect protection from predators. Weather poses another potential threat, with some chicks in Cambodia reported as being blown from nests by high winds.

The white-shouldered population on the Mahakam River in East Kalimantan was severely affected by fire damage to forest during an El Nino Southern Oscillation during the mid-1990s. Alongside the primary implication of loss of suitable habitat, the fire may have also led to increased riverbank erosion due to fewer trees, decreased water clarity, and changes in water temperature patterns through fewer overhanging branches; all of which may have affected the birds’ ability to successfully forage on riverbanks and gravel beds.

==In relation with humans==
Given this species&#x27; large apparent reliance on human agricultural activity (both traditional arable and pastoral) to maintain its habitats, they live closer to human habitation than do similar sympatric species such as the giant ibis; and may even roost and nest in trees near to rice paddies even when in use by people. However, this ibis is more likely more attracted to the agricultural foraging grounds close to human habitation rather than humans per se. Although the white-shouldered ibis is exploited opportunistically by humans for food, it is not commercially valued for trade.

The only captive record for this species is for one specimen that was imported into Thailand from Cambodia in 1989, and held at the Queen&#x27;s Bird Park at Ayuthhaya near Bangkok in 1990.

==Status==
Populations of the white-shouldered ibis declined severely in the late 20th century. Given the scarcity of recorded sightings in the past few decades, the small population size and persistent habitat loss, it has been classified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN. The global population is estimated at 1000 individuals, an estimated 670 of which are mature. A total of 973 individuals were counted in a nationwide population census in Cambodia in 2013, whereas 30-100 individuals are estimated for the Indonesian portion of the species’ range.

<text>David Markey (born December 3, 1963, in Burbank, California, United States) is an American film director.

==Biography==
As a self-taught filmmaker and musician, David Markey directed, produced, edited, and photographed most of his films, the majority of which have been self-funded. His work is also noted as documenting the punk scene in Southern California throughout the 1980s, growing to find a larger audience in the 1990s while continuing to produce work throughout the 2000s and 2010s. Markey has worked with Sonic Youth, Nirvana, Dinosaur Jr, Mudhoney, Redd Kross, Bob Mould, Circle Jerks, The Ramones, Black Flag and the Meat Puppets.

Markey made his first film in 1974 at the age of 11 with his father&#x27;s hand-wound 8mm Brownie camera, cast from the children of his Santa Monica, California neighborhood. He soon discovered the burgeoning LA punk scene a few years hence through bands like X, Black Flag, and Redd Kross in 1980. Markey was driven to form his own band, SIN 34, in 1981 as well as Painted Willie in 1984. He also started &quot;We Got Power&quot; fanzine in 1981 along with Jordan Schwartz, spawning Markey&#x27;s cinematic Super-8 cult punk scene document &quot;The Slog Movie&quot; in 1982. Following closely behind was &quot;Desperate Teenage Lovedolls&quot; (1984) and its 1986 sequel &quot;Lovedolls Superstar&quot;. These films were distributed underground and critically well-received, putting Markey on the cinematic punk map before he was of legal age. Markey&#x27;s work has since been exhibited internationally, including theatrical release in the US and Canada of &quot;1991: The Year Punk Broke&quot;, followed by a VHS release by the David Geffen Company. In 2011 Universal Music Group re-released the film in the DVD format with an hour plus of bonus material produced by Markey. Theatrical screenings of his work have taken place in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Toronto and elsewhere. His 2008 documentary &quot;The Reinactors&quot; was included in international film festivals in Argentina, England, Scotland, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Portugal, Angola, China, Korea, Italy and The Netherlands.

David Markey has appeared in the documentary films &quot;American Hardcore and&quot; &quot;We Jam Econo.&quot; Markey was interviewed for the 20th Century Fox re-release of Russ Meyer&#x27;s &quot;Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls&quot; Special Edition DVD in 2006. He played a bouncer in the 2007 film &quot;What We Do Is Secret.&quot; He is also seen as an uncredited extra in Penelope Spheeris 1983 film &quot;Suburbia&quot; and the 1984 film &quot;Girls Just Want To Have Fun&quot;.

In October 2012, he became a published author as Bazillion Points released the critically acclaimed hard bound book &quot;We Got Power: Hardcore Punk Scenes From 1980&#x27;s Southern California, c&quot;onsisting primarily of the photographic work of Markey and his longtime collaborator Jordan Schwartz. The book&#x27;s release was timed with a gallery retrospective of the duo&#x27;s photos from the early 1980s to the early 1990s entitled &quot;We Survived The Pit&quot; at Track 16 Gallery in Santa Monica, blocks away from where Markey and Schwartz grew up.

<text>The Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV) is the Raytheon-manufactured interceptor component with subcontractor Aerojet of the U.S. Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD), part of the larger National Missile Defense system.

The EKV is boosted to an intercept trajectory by a boost vehicle (missile), where it separates from the boost vehicle and autonomously collides with an incoming warhead.

The EKV is launched by the Ground-Based Interceptor (GBI) missile, the launch vehicle of the GMD system. The EKV&#x27;s own rockets and fuel are for corrections in the trajectory, not for further acceleration.

The successor to the EKV, known as the Redesigned Kill Vehicle (RKV), was scheduled to debut in 2025. The RKV program, headed by Boeing and lead subcontractor Raytheon, was canceled by the Department of Defense on August 21, 2019. Earlier in the year, the Pentagon had issued a stop work order on the project following a design review deferment in December 2018 due to the failure of critical components meeting technical specification.

Raytheon is contracted to sustain, upgrade, and repair the EKV through 2034 until after the deployment of the Next Generation Interceptor (NGI), which will start to replace the EKV in 2030.

<text>Poul Holmskov Schlüter (; 3 April 1929 – 27 May 2021) was a Danish politician who served as Prime Minister of Denmark from 1982 to 1993. He was the first (and to date, only) member of the Conservative People&#x27;s Party to become Prime Minister, as well as the first conservative to hold the office since 1901. Schlüter was a member of the Folketing (Danish parliament) for the Conservative People&#x27;s Party from 1964 to 1994. He was also Chairman of the Conservative People&#x27;s Party from 1974 to 1977 and from 1981 to 1993.

==Early life==
Schlüter&#x27;s paternal grandfather was a bricklayer from Holstein, who had moved to Tønder and married a Dane. His family was not immune to the antagonisms that developed in North Schleswig between the Danish majority and the German minority following the 1920 Schleswig plebiscites.

Born in Tønder, south Jutland, he graduated from the University of Copenhagen in 1957 with a degree in law, and joined the bar in 1960.

==Political career==

In 1964, Schlüter was elected to the Folketing for the Conservative People&#x27;s Party. He was elected leader of the Conservatives from 1974, defeating Erik Ninn-Hansen. Though he lost the position in 1977, he regained it two years later. 

In 1982, after Prime Minister Anker Jørgensen was forced to resign, Schlüter constructed a four-party coalition and was appointed his successor. During his time as Prime Minister, he was named &quot;Nordic Politician of the Year&quot; (in 1984). He was subsequently granted a large number of Danish and international awards and medals.

Previously, he had served as a member of the Council of Europe from 1971 to 1974, and had headed the Danish Delegation to the Nordic Council, where he served as a member of the Council Presidium, in 1978 and 1979. He retired as Prime Minister in 1993 after an inquiry found that he had misinformed the Danish Parliament. The case was known as the Tamil Case (), as it involved asylum requests from Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka who fled because of the civil war.

When Schlüter resigned in 1993, he attempted to have Uffe Ellemann Jensen (Venstre) appointed acting prime minister until the Conservative Henning Dyremose could take over. The attempt was dropped as royal cabinet secretary Niels Eilschou Holm considered the maneuver unconstitutional. Instead, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (Social Democrats) was appointed prime minister following a &quot;Queen&#x27;s round&quot;.

Following his retirement as Prime Minister in 1993, Schlüter served as a member of the European Parliament from 1994 to 1999, the first three years as Vice-President of the body.

==Other ventures==
In 2003, Schlüter was appointed by the Swedish Minister of Co-operation as her special envoy to promote freedom of movement in the Nordic countries. Schlüter was to work on ways of increasing individual freedom of movement and present specific proposals to the Nordic Council Session in October 2003.

In 2004, Schlüter co-founded the first Danish free-market think tank CEPOS, and gave the opening speech at CEPOS&#x27; opening reception at the Hotel D&#x27;Angleterre in Copenhagen.

==Personal life==

Schlüter was married three times: On 16 March 1963, he married Majken Steen-Andersen, but the couple divorced in 1978. Their only child, Peter, was born in 1963. Schlüter then married Lisbeth Povelsen on 20 September 1979. She died during her husband&#x27;s premiership on 17 February 1988.

On 21 July 1989, while still prime minister, Schlüter married the Danish ballet dancer Anne Marie Vessel as his third wife. 

==Death==
Schlüter died of natural causes at the Bispebjerg Hospital in Frederiksberg, Copenhagen, on 27 May 2021, at the age of 92. According to his family statement, it was announced that Schlüter had fallen asleep peacefully, surrounded by his loved ones.

Many Danish politics, who paid tribute to Schlüter included four living prime ministers (Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, and Helle Thorning-Schmidt), current prime minister Mette Frederiksen, and former Danish foreign minister Per Stig Møller: 

Schlüter was interred at the Holmen Church in Copenhagen.

<text>Washington Place is a Greek Revival palace in the Hawaii Capital Historic District in Honolulu, Hawaii. It was where Queen Liliuokalani was arrested during the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom. Later it became the official residence of the governor of Hawaii. In 2007, it was designated as a National Historic Landmark. The current governor&#x27;s residence was built in 2008 behind the historic residence, and is located on the same grounds as Washington Place.

==Construction==

An American merchant sea captain, John Dominis (1796–1846) came to America in 1819 from Trieste, probably from a Croatian family. After making a number of voyages across the Pacific, he relocated to the islands in 1837 with his Bostonian wife Mary Jones Dominis (1803–1889) and son John Owen Dominis (1832–1891) from New York. The captain was awarded some land in 1842 as settlement of a lawsuit with the British Consul Richard Charlton. The captain continued to take voyages to raise money for the construction of a house. In 1846 he sailed for China on the Brig &quot;William Neilson,&quot; intending to purchase Chinese-made furniture for the house, which was nearing completion. The ship was lost at sea, along with the American Agent George Brown, and Mary Dominis became a widow. She rented out a suite of rooms to support herself and young John Owen. One of the first boarders was Anthony Ten Eyck, an American Commissioner to the islands appointed by President James K. Polk who established the American Legation in the house. Ten Eyck named the house &quot;Washington Place&quot; in a February 22, 1848 letter, after George Washington in celebration of the first US president&#x27;s birthday. King Kamehameha III officially approved the name.

The American flag was raised at the residence until Mary Dominis&#x27;s death in 1889 when Liliuokalani had it removed. In 1917, Liliuokalani raised the American flag at Washington Place in honor of five Hawaiian sailors who had perished in the sinking of the SS &quot;Aztec&quot; by German submarines. Her act was interpreted by many as her symbolic support of the United States.

The building was designed by the master carpenter Isaac Hart, who had helped build the first Iolani Palace. The building was also constructed by Daniel Jenner, an Italian master mason. The interior was originally finished by the master painter Israel Wright. Native Hawaiians were also involved with the construction of the building, but are not named individually by the archival records. Washington Place was constructed with &quot;open lānais&quot; on all sides.

The foundation of the building, the lower level walls and the lower columns are constructed of coral stone. The upper floor is of wood-frame construction. Washington Place conforms to period French Creole Greek Revival houses that were built along the lower Gulf-Coastal region of the southeastern United States. The home was constructed with an almost square core surrounded by a peristyle, a two tiered verandah, Tuscan columns on its upper floor, and a hipped roof. The interior of the home is arranged in a traditional Georgian floor plan, with four distinct parlors on the first floor and four bedchambers on the second floor.

==History==

William Little Lee made Washington Place his home from 1849–1854. Lee was instrumental in integrating a Western legal system in the Hawaiian Islands, based upon the Massachusetts model. Lee also authored the Great Mahele, which introduced private land ownership into Hawaiian culture.

Lydia Kamakaeha Pākī, the future Queen Liliuokalani and the heir apparent to the throne of the Kingdom of Hawaii, married John Owen Dominis in 1862, making Washington Place the private residence of the princess and future queen. Another Massachusetts lawyer, Alfred S. Hartwell, rented a guest room from 1868 until 1872. He describes Mary as still expecting her husband to return any day.
Mary Dominis died on April 25, 1889, and John Owen Dominis died on August 27, 1891, leaving the property to Liliuokalani, who had just become Queen after the death of her brother, King Kalākaua.

===Arrest of the Queen===
During 1893, Washington Place was the site of the dramatic events of the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom. It was there that the queen was arrested by the new governmental forces that were aided by a detachment of United States Marines. The queen was tried before a military tribunal, where she was charged with concealment of treason against the new government, the Republic of Hawaii. She was convicted and was confined for several months at Washington Place after her release from imprisonment at Iolani Palace.

Queen Liliuokalani resided at Washington Place for the remainder of her life. She died in the downstairs bedroom of the house on November 11, 1917. The home offers the citizens of Hawaii a strong sense of place and belonging in association with the kingdom and of Queen Liliuokalani&#x27;s memory.

===Executive Mansion===
In her book, &quot;Hawaii&#x27;s Story by Hawaii&#x27;s Queen&quot;, Liliuokalani described the building as &quot;a palatial dwelling&quot; and a &quot;choice tropical retreat in the midst of the chief city of the Hawaiian islands.&quot;

On May 14, 1921, the territorial legislature of Hawaii purchased Washington Place for $55,000 from the estate of Queen Liliuokalani to serve as the Executive Mansion of the Territorial Governor of Hawaii. It was remodeled in 1922 by Governor Wallace Rider Farrington. In all, it was the residence of twelve territorial and state governors of Hawaii. Technically, it was the residence of thirteen governors, because John Owen Dominis, Liliuokalani&#x27;s consort, had been Governor of the island of Oahu from 1868 to 1891. The house served in this role until 2002, when it was converted into a historic house museum. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 18, 1973, and was designated a National Historic Landmark on March 29, 2007.

In 2002 a new governor&#x27;s residence was built behind the historic Washington Place, within its grounds, and continues to serve the same purpose.

<text>Bear Mountain is a peak of the southern Taconic Mountains in Salisbury, Connecticut. At (note, per references 1 and 3, there is disagreement about the precise elevation), Bear Mountain is the highest mountain that lies wholly within Connecticut. However, it is not the state highpoint: in the 1940s, the United States Geological Survey determined that the highest elevation in the state, at , was actually on the nearby Connecticut-Massachusetts border, on the southern slope of Massachusetts’ Mount Frissell. There is a stone monument on the Bear Mountain summit. The Appalachian Trail crosses the mountain in a generally north-south direction.

<text>Bread is a British television sitcom, written and created by Carla Lane, about a close-knit, working-class family in Liverpool, England. It was produced by the BBC and screened on BBC1 from 1 May 1986 to 3 November 1991. In 1988, the ratings for the series peaked at 21 million viewers.

==Plot summary==
The series focused on the extended Boswell family of Liverpool, in the district of Dingle. The family were Catholic and working class, and led by the acid-tongued matriarch Nellie Boswell (Jean Boht) who ruled over her family with an iron fist. Early series focused on her children attempting to make enough money (in English slang, &quot;&quot;) to support the family through various illicit means. Later series saw less emphasis on moneymaking schemes, and more storylines focusing on the characters&#x27; love lives and marriages.

==Characters==
The Boswell family consisted of Nellie&#x27;s philandering, free-spirited husband Freddie (Ronald Forfar) who spent most of the series with one foot in the family household, and the other with his mistress, the red-haired Irish siren Lilo Lil (Eileen Pollock). This union led to one of the series&#x27; most famous catchphrases, which Nellie frequently declared about Lilo Lil in a storm of rage: &quot;She is a tart!&quot;

Eldest child Joey (Peter Howitt/Graham Bickley) was essentially the level-headed household head, with his leather trousers, classic Jaguar, and charming demeanor (&quot;Greetings!&quot; was his catchphrase), Joey was involved in tax fraud after making a fortune selling personalised number plates and not declaring this to the taxman. Throughout the series, Joey was in love with dour, demanding divorcee Roxy (Joanna Phillips-Lane), whom he finally married in the final series. The character was extremely popular for the first four series, and Peter Howitt was considered the series&#x27; heartthrob and breakthrough star. When he decided to leave &quot;Bread&quot; to concentrate on directing and other acting opportunities, his replacement was not as popular with viewers, so the character wasn&#x27;t as prominent in the later series.

Second-eldest child Jack was the thoughtful, sensitive type who ran an antique-dealing business, often with disastrous results. Actor Victor McGuire was absent in series 4, and Jack went to America for a year. He returned in series 5 and eventually fell in love with an older woman, Leonora (Deborah Grant), who moved in across the road. Adrian (Jonathon Morris) was the theatrical poet, who had his poetry published (&#x27;My Granny&#x27;s Bucket&#x27;). His real name was Jimmy, but he changed his name to Adrian which he considered &quot;less common&quot;. He endured relationships with several highly-sexed women and was frequently seen emerging red-faced from the bushes.
The youngest Boswell son, Billy (Nick Conway), was loud-mouthed, annoying, and immature. He somehow managed to father Francesca with his miserable mistress Julie (Caroline Milmoe/Hilary Crowson) who lived across the road. Billy married Julie in series 3, but they were divorced by series 5, and Julie moved to Sefton Park (and left the series), leaving Billy devastated. Billy drove an old Volkswagen Beetle which constantly backfired when driven, as well as a van from the back of which he sold sandwiches.

The only Boswell daughter was Aveline (Gilly Coman/Melanie Hill), a colourful, enduring model who married Protestant vicar Oswald Carter (Giles Watling) at the end of series 4 (to staunchly-Catholic Nellie&#x27;s outrage); after trying to conceive throughout series 5, Aveline gives birth to Ursula in series 6.

Next door is grumpy, permanently-hungry Grandad (Kenneth Waller). The series doesn&#x27;t make explicitly-clear whether he is Nellie&#x27;s or Freddie&#x27;s father, as he is only ever referred to and called Grandad. However, in a fleeting sequence in a series-4 episode, Freddie is arrested for stealing his rubbish cart. When the family arrive at the Police Station to collect him, Nellie refers to Freddie as Grandad&#x27;s son-in-law for the only time, confirming that he is, in fact, her own father. In later series we are told Grandad&#x27;s name is William Duvall and Nellie refers to her maiden name of Duvall. This confirms that Grandad was Nellie&#x27;s father. He appeared in all seven series and was in the last episode&#x27;s final scene, alongside Jean Boht. Grandad was frequently seen telling people to &quot;Piss off!&quot; and reminiscing about his childhood sweetheart Edie Matteson. However, in the spin off book &quot;Mrs Boswells Slice of Bread&quot;, it is confirmed that Grandad is Nellie&#x27;s father. Grandad speaks in a noticeable Lancashire accent rather than his family&#x27;s distinctively Liverpudlian tones, suggesting that the Duvall clan may originate outside of Liverpool.

There are also several notable supporting characters seen throughout the series: the deadpan Department of Health and Social Security clerk Martina (Pamela Power) spent all seven series enduring the various tales the Boswells spun to get more dole money. She perfected her catchphrase &quot;Next!&quot; but ultimately failed to snare her favourite Boswell, &#x27;Shifty&#x27; (Bryan Murray), after several attempts at a relationship with him. Shifty arrived in series 4, ostensibly to cover Jack&#x27;s absence in the series, but he stayed on in &quot;Bread&quot; after Jack&#x27;s return and lived next door with Grandad until the end of the sixth series.

Other neighbours include Celia Higgins, played by Rita Tushingham during series 4; in series 6 and 7, Leonora Campbell (Deborah Grant) moved into Julie&#x27;s old house and eventually began dating Jack. The Boswells had a mongrel dog as a pet, called Mongy, who was run over and killed in one episode, leading to the family scattering his ashes into the Mersey.

The show&#x27;s title is a reference to &quot;bread&quot; meaning &quot;money&quot;; though this is not a Liverpudlian Scouse expression but cockney rhyming slang (&quot;bread and honey&quot;). Liverpudlians at the time largely referred to money as &quot;dough&quot;. A regular scenario in each episode was that of Nellie opening a cockerel-fashioned kitchen egg-basket prior to the evening meal into which the family would place money for their upkeep. The amount of money placed in the pot by each depended on how successful a day they&#x27;d had. The pot would be at the forefront of the screen at the end of each episode as the credits rolled.

Other frequently-seen scenarios included Nellie answering a cordless phone (a newfangled item in the mid-1980s) which she kept in the pocket of her pinny (she always said &quot;Hello, yes?&quot; when answering, followed by a series of frantic &quot;Thank you&quot;s when it was Derek (Peter Byrne), Nellie&#x27;s secret park-bench pal, on the other end); also ensuring the parking places outside the terraced house were kept free for the family&#x27;s many vehicles, by putting out illicitly-acquired police traffic cones.

The show featured soap opera-style cliffhangers, meaning that viewers had to watch each week to see how the previous week&#x27;s cliffhanger would be resolved. This also meant that each episode was not self-contained, but the plot unfolded as the series progressed. This was unusual for a comedy at the time, but has been used to great effect by comedies since.

==Episodes==


==Spin-offs==
The theme tune was sung by the cast members and was released on BBC Records but failed to make the UK singles chart. The theme was re-recorded for the fifth series of the show, due to BBC1&#x27;s transition from mono to NICAM stereo sound – the original theme had been recorded in mono - and also to allow Graham Bickley and Melanie Hill, who joined the cast in Series 5 replacing the original Joey and Aveline respectively, to replace the originals in the vocals.

A comic strip based on the series featured in the BBC&#x27;s Teen magazine &quot;Fast Forward&quot;, although the overall tone was altered for the magazines younger readership, and most of the featured stories were of a generic nature, not following the continuity of the television series and mostly just using the characters to tell simple joke stories .

After the series had finished, a stage play of the show entitled &quot;Bread – The Farewell Slice&quot; toured the UK.

Also following the end of the series, Jonathon Morris announced his desire for a follow-up series about his character, theatrical poet Adrian, feeling that the character &#x27;had a lot of potential and a lot of stories yet to tell beyond the &quot;Bread&quot; setting&#x27;, and suggested the premise of Adrian moving down to London in hopes of cracking the bigger theatrical scene. He proposed his idea to the BBC and even announced his hopes for the series during an appearance in March 1991 on Saturday morning programme &quot;Going Live!&quot; as filming for the final series of &quot;Bread&quot; was drawing to a close. The BBC declined on the suggestion; Morris went on to co-write a one-man play based around Adrian which he intended to tour with, and also in hope of using it as an example to the BBC of what could be done with the character. The project was eventually dropped, due to ownership rights for the character with Carla Lane. However the effort was not completely detrimental to Morris, as his enthusiasm led to &quot;Going Live!&quot; host Phillip Schofield recommending Morris for his replacement as presenter for &quot;Children&#x27;s BBC&quot; series &quot;The Movie Game&quot;, a position which Morris went on to fill.

==Criticism==
Though the show was popular, and received audiences over 21 million, &quot;Bread&quot; was criticised for mocking Liverpudlian culture and people, who had suffered significant economic downturn and unemployment in the 1980s. Lane countered these criticisms saying that her characters were cartoonish and one-dimensional, and were not intended to be a serious social comment on the state of Liverpool.

== DVD releases ==
In the UK, the first four series were released in two 3-DVD sets in 2003. However, the first series&#x27; episodes had some, but not all, profanity bleeped out or muted. A 16-DVD &quot;Complete Collection&quot; followed in 2014, containing all 74 episodes and the three Christmas specials. This time, episodes from series three onwards and the specials were uncensored but the first two series consisted of the previously-released censored discs.

In Australia, only the first 5 seasons have been released so far and it is unknown if the remaining seasons will follow.

<text>Grouseland, the William Henry Harrison Mansion and Museum, is a National Historic Landmark important for its Federal-style architecture and role in American history. The two-story, red brick home was built between 1802 and 1804 in Vincennes, Indiana, for William Henry Harrison (1773–1841) during his tenure from 1801 to 1812 as the first governor of the Indiana Territory. The residence was completed in 1804, and Harrison reportedly named it Grouseland due to the abundance of grouse in the area.

==History==
===Construction===
In 1800, U.S. president John Adams appointed twenty-seven-year-old William Henry Harrison the first governor of the Indiana Territory. Soon after his arrival in Vincennes in 1801, Harrison began planning the construction of a home on of land he purchased adjacent to the town. When Harrison was certain of remaining for a second term as territorial governor, construction began on his Federal-style mansion, which was built between 1802 and 1804.

Grouseland was home to William Henry and Anna Tuthill (Symmes) Harrison and their children until 1812. At least three of the Harrisons&#x27; ten children were born at Grouseland, including John Scott Harrison, the father of Benjamin Harrison (the 23rd president of the United States). The Harrisons left Grouseland in 1812 and moved to North Bend, Ohio. Harrison served in the U.S. Army during the War of 1812, and later as a member of the Ohio Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the U.S. Senate before his election in 1840 as the 9th president of the United States.

Grouseland was designed by the architect William Lindsay and constructed in the Federal style, reminiscent of the aristocratic homes where Harrison spent his boyhood in Virginia. Grouseland was a marked contrast to the log cabins of the Indiana Territory&#x27;s other residents. 
In the early 19th century, the territory was on the edge of the American frontier with few established roads, and Vincennes, the territorial capital, had an American and French population estimated at only 700. Grouseland was built at great personal expense to Governor Harrison; it is believed to have cost an estimated US$20,000 at the time of its construction.

Grouseland&#x27;s builder used skilled labor and local bricks manufactured not far from Vincennes. It is believed to have been the first brick building in Vincennes as well as the Indiana Territory. Limestone blocks for the home&#x27;s foundation were obtained from nearby quarries. Grouseland was decorated in grand style with items imported from Europe. At least one biographer surmises that Harrison&#x27;s motives in constructing such an elaborate home in the wilderness included establishing the respect due to him as governor, despite his relative youth at the time. Grouseland reflected Harrison&#x27;s position and marked his place in American aristocracy. (William Henry Harrison was the youngest son of Benjamin Harrison, V, a signer of the Declaration of Independence.)

===Governor&#x27;s home===
During Harrison&#x27;s governorship of the Indiana Territory, Grouseland was the focal point of the social and official life of the territory. Visiting legislators were frequently entertained and overnight guests at the governor&#x27;s home. (When it was the capital of the Northwest Territory, more territory was governed from Vincennes than any city outside Washington, D.C.) Governor Harrison also met with Indian leaders that included Little Turtle, Buckongahelas, and other representatives from various American Indian tribes to negotiate a number of important land cession treaties. (Harrison&#x27;s eleven treaties with Native American leaders between 1803 and 1809 resulted in cession of American Indian lands in the southern third of present-day Indiana and most of Illinois, comprising millions of acres of land for future settlement.) Five of the land-ceding treaties that Harrison negotiated with Native American leaders were signed at Grouseland, including the Treaty of Grouseland (1805), which was signed in the mansion&#x27;s council chamber (main floor parlor).

Harrison also had two confrontations with the Shawnee leader Tecumseh at Grouseland. On August 12, 1810, Harrison met with Tecumseh, who was accompanied by 100 to 400 braves (sources report different numbers), on the lawn in front of Grouseland. The meeting lasted for eight days but ended without a treaty. Their differences were later settled in battle as part of Tecumseh&#x27;s War. Harrison defeated Tenskwatawa (the Prophet), who was Tecumseh&#x27;s brother, at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811, and defeated Tecumseh at Battle of the Thames in 1813.

===Other uses===
After Harrison&#x27;s departure from Grouseland in 1812, its next resident was Judge Benjamin Parke. In 1821, Grouseland was deeded to Harrison&#x27;s son-in-law, John Cleves Symmes Harrison, who lived in the home with his wife, Clarissa, and their six children for about ten years. Harrison family heirs retained their home until 1850. Afterwards, Grouseland served several purposes, including a grain warehouse, library, hotel, and a private residence.

===Preservation===
In 1909 the Vincennes Water Company acquired the property and planned to demolish the historic home and use the site for other purposes. However, the Francis Vigo Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution raised funds to purchase the home and save it from demolition. By 1916 the local DAR chapter had raised US$2,000 from the community and were given a limited deed to property. The DAR restored the home to the period when William Henry Harrison lived there, including furnishing it with a few Harrison family possessions. It opened as a historical museum in 1911. The City of Vincennes acquired the water company in 1935 and gave the local DAR chapter a quitclaim deed to Grouseland.

===House museum===
Grouseland was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960 and listed on the National Register of Historical Places in 1966. Situated at the northwest corner of Park and Scott streets, within the present-day Vincennes Historic District, it is owned by the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, the organization that saved the building from destruction. The property is maintained by the Grouseland Foundation, a volunteer board of directors composed of DAR and non-DAR members that manages the structure and programs. The Grouseland Rifle is owned by the Foundation and exhibited at Grouseland; dating from the early 19th century, it has been designated the state firearm of Indiana. The main campus of Vincennes University is adjacent to the property. Other state historic sites in Vincennes include the Territorial Capitol building.

==Description==
Grouseland&#x27;s present-day site on a half-city block about from the Wabash River was part of Harrison&#x27;s estate in Vincennes. The two-story, redbrick home in the Federal style has a high roof and dormer windows with an attic. The structure rests on a basement with a limestone foundation. The main house and rear dependency are joined by a covered passage. The first floor of the main house has a parlor (council chamber) to the left and a dining room to the right of an entry and hallway leading to a library at the rear. The second floor has six bedrooms and a passageway connecting to the rear dependency.

<doc id="670328" wikidata="Q462918" url="?curid=670328" title="Flag of Vojvodina">
<text>There are two flags in official use in the Serbian Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, the Flag of Vojvodina and the Traditional flag of Vojvodina. Two flags are given the equal status in the 
&quot;Provincial Assembly Decision on the Appearance and Usage of Symbols and Traditional Symbols of AP Vojvodina&quot; adopted in 2016.

Both the Flag and the Traditional flag of Vojvodina are based on the Serb tricolour. It consists of three horizontal strands of red, blue and white, with the blue portion being significantly wider in the Flag and all three strands being of the same width in the Traditional flag. The blue portion of the Flag of Vojvodina contains three yellow stars representing the three geographic regions of Vojvodina: Bačka, Banat and Srem. The flag of Vojvodina was adopted on 27 February 2004. The Traditional flag of Vojvodina has two variants, with and without the Traditional coat of arms of Vojvodina in the middle. Both variants have equal status. The Traditional flag was adopted on 15 September 2016.
==History==
===Historical flag of Serbian Vojvodina===
*According to the Constitution of Serbian Vojvodina, the flag was a Serbian tricolour (red-blue-white).
*The flag of the Serbian Vojvodina was introduced in 1848, and featured a coat-of-arms which was essentially the Austrian Habsburg imperial arms, with the coat-of-arms of the Serbs (Serbian cross) on the chest of the black eagle. The bearer of the Serbian arms was the Austrian black eagle, instead of the Serbian white one, in order to show the fidelity of the newly established Voivodship to the Imperial Court in Vienna. The coat-of-arms was added to the yellow-black background. Thus the flag differed from the flag of the Principality of Serbia, which used Serbian national tricolour and had a different arms in the middle of its state flag.

On March 17, 2015, the Assembly of Vojvodina failed to meet two-thirds of votes on the legislation of parallel use of the historical coat of arms and flag from 1848.

===1990s proposed unofficial flag===
The blue-yellow-green flag (vertical and horizontal) was used as an unofficial flag of Vojvodina by some regionalist political parties such as League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina, Vojvodina Coalition, etc. This flag was introduced during the 1990s (at the time when Vojvodina did not have its official flag) with the proposal that it should become the future flag of Vojvodina. Since the adoption of the official Vojvodina flag in 2004, the proposed flag has mostly been abandoned as an unofficial symbol of the province, and is today only sporadically used as the LSV party flag. The proposed 1990s flag is based on the similar flag that dates back to 11 May 1848, when it was adopted as the flag of the Serb revolutionaries from Šajkaška (central part of Vojvodina, east of Novi Sad). More precisely, that flag was used by the Šajkaš Battalion that belonged to the Germanic-Illyric Regiment of the Banatian Military Frontier. However, the original flag had a brownish colour instead of green. There are horizontal variants of the flag as well.

Those who proposed the flag during the 1990s contended that blue, yellow and green colours representing the sky, corn and grazing land (pasture), respectively. Another interpretation is that those colours representing the sky, sun and fertile land of Vojvodina, respectively.

During the 1990s, this flag was one of the symbols of Vojvodinian regionalist movement that was opposing Milošević&#x27;s regime in Belgrade. Today this flag is used as a party flag of the League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina, which advocated that Vojvodina should become a constituent republic of the new regionalised and federalised Serbia. However, even this party now uses the official flag of Vojvodina, as a symbol of the region.

<doc id="670329" wikidata="Q7788184" url="?curid=670329" title="Thomas Cadwalader">
<text>Thomas Cadwalader ( – November 14, 1779) was an American physician in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

==Early life==
Cadwalader was born in Philadelphia in . He was the only son of four children born of Martha ( Jones) Cadwalader (1679–1747) and John Cadwalader (1677–1734), who was born in Bala, Wales before coming to the Province of Pennsylvania in British America in 1697, seeking a place to practice his Quaker faith.

He was educated at the Friends Public Schools (today known as the William Penn Charter School) in Philadelphia.

==Career==
After studying medicine with his uncle Dr. Evan Jones, he traveled to London, where he was an understudy of English surgeon William Cheselden. In France, he likely attended lectures at Rheims University. 

In 1739, he moved to Trenton, New Jersey, where he served as commissioner of the pleas and peace from 1739 to 1744 and as chief burgess of Trenton from 1746 to 1750. In 1745, his medical essay on &quot;dry-gripes,&quot; a condition similar to colic, was published. Before he moved back to Philadelphia, he donated five hundred pounds to Trenton to erect a public library.

After returning to Philadelphia in 1750, he was elected in 1751 to the city&#x27;s Common Council. He served on Pennsylvania&#x27;s Provincial Council from 1755 until the Revolution. He was a founder in 1751, and one of the first doctors, at the Pennsylvania Hospital, where he worked until his death. 

Dr. Cadwalader was one of the first to inoculate patients against smallpox. He was a founder and director of the Library Company of Philadelphia, and a member of the American Philosophical Society, where he served as vice president from 1769 to 1770.

==Personal life==

In June 1738, Thomas married Hannah Lambert (1712-1786), a daughter of Thomas Lambert Jr. and Anne ( Wood) Lambert. Together they had eight children, six daughters and two sons who were both active in the American Revolutionary War: 

* Anne Cadwalader, who died in infancy.
* Martha Cadwalader (1739–1791), who married Gen. John Dagworthy in 1774.
* John Cadwalader (1742–1786), who married Elizabeth Lloyd, the daughter of Edward Lloyd and sister of Edward Lloyd IV, in 1768. After her death, he married Williamina Bond, a daughter of Dr. Phineas Bond, and niece of Thomas Bond, in 1779.
* Lambert Cadwalader (1742–1823), who married Mary McCall, the daughter of Archibald and Judith (née Kemble) McCall.
* Mary Cadwalader (1744–1791), who married her cousin Sen. Philemon Dickinson, a younger brother of Founding Father John Dickinson.
* Rebecca Cadwalader (1746–1821), who married Sen. Philemon Dickinson, after the death of her sister Mary.
* Margaret Cadwalader (1748–1820), who married Gen. Samuel Meredith in 1772; he later became the 2nd Treasurer of the United States.
* Elizabeth Cadwalader (1754–1799), who died unmarried.

Cadwalader died on November 14, 1779, at age 72, in Trenton.

===Descendants===
Through his daughter Martha, he was a grandfather of Rachael Dagworthy, who married U.S. Senator William H. Wells.

Through his son Lambert, he was posthumously a grandfather of Thomas McCall Cadwalader, who married Maria Charlotte Gouverneur (the sister of Assemblyman Samuel L. Gouverneur and the niece of Elizabeth Kortright and U.S. President James Monroe).

==Legacy==
Cadwalader Park, in Trenton, New Jersey, was named in his family&#x27;s honor. The park has an area of nearly , and was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and built starting in 1887.

<text>Lispkit Lisp is a lexically scoped, purely functional subset of Lisp (Pure Lisp) developed as a testbed for functional programming concepts. It was first used for early experimentation with lazy evaluation. An implementation based on a &quot;stack, environment, control, dump&quot; virtual machine and abstract machine (SECD machine) written in an ALGOL variant was published by the developer Peter Henderson in 1980. The compiler and virtual machine are highly portable and as a result have been implemented on many machines.

== Base language ==
The base language provides the following functions only but extensions are discussed in Henderson&#x27;s book for the explicit support of lazy evaluation and nondeterministic programming.
:codice_1 – given an expression returns True if its value is atomic; False if not
:codice_2 – given two expressions returns the sum of their numeric values
:codice_3 – given an expression whose value is a pair, returns the pair&#x27;s first value
:codice_4 – given an expression whose value is a pair, returns the pair&#x27;s second value
:codice_5 – given two expressions returns a value pair consisting of their values
:codice_6 – given two expressions returns the quotient of their numeric values
:codice_7 – given two expressions returns True if their values are equal; False if not
:codice_8 – given three expressions returns the value of the second if the value of the first is True, otherwise returns the value of the third
:codice_9 – given an argument list and an expression, returns them as a function
:codice_10 – given an expression with declarations (as named expressions visible in the expression) returns its value
:codice_11 – like let, except the declared names are also visible in the declarations themselves
:codice_12 – given two expressions, returns True if the value of the first is numerically less than or equal to the value of the second; False if not
:codice_13 (or codice_14) – given two expressions, returns the modulus (also known as the remainder) of their numeric values
:codice_15 – given two expressions, returns the product of their numeric values
:codice_16 – given an expression, returns that expression as a value
:codice_17 – given two expressions, returns the difference of their numeric values

The functions, codice_9, codice_10, and codice_11, are similar but have subtle differences in the way that they treat named variables which make them useful in different ways: codice_9 defines and returns a function, codice_10 binds expressions to variable names, and codice_11 is essentially similar to codice_10 except it allows defining of recursive functions and values, e.g., infinite series.

<text>&quot;November Rain&quot; is a song by American hard rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses. Written by the band&#x27;s lead vocalist Axl Rose, the power ballad was released on February 24, 1992 in the United Kingdom and Europe as the third single from the band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; (1991). The single was released in the United States in June 1992 and peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It was the longest song to enter the top ten of the chart at the time of its release. , it was also the fourth longest song to enter the Hot 100 chart. Additionally, &quot;November Rain&quot; reached number two on the Portuguese Singles Chart, number four on the UK Singles Chart, and the top 10 on several other music charts around the world.

==Background==
Slash states in his autobiography that the band recorded in 1986 an 18-minute version of &quot;November Rain&quot; at a session with guitarist Manny Charlton (of rock band Nazareth) the year prior to beginning sessions for &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;.

According to a story Axl Rose reported during the 2006 leg of the Chinese Democracy Tour, no other band members wanted to participate in the production of this song (or the other notable ballad &quot;Estranged&quot;). Slash and Duff McKagan were opposed to the band&#x27;s drift to symphonic ballads, feeling their choice of more direct rock songs were being overlooked by Rose. Eventually, Rose persuaded the others during work at Can-Am Studios (where some of the album was recorded and mixed). Slash disputed Axl&#x27;s claims of harsh musical differences in his autobiography released the next year.

Slash reported that his guitar solo in the song&#x27;s album version developed directly from an improvisation.

==Writing and composition==
&quot;November Rain&quot; is the third-longest song by Guns N&#x27; Roses, behind &quot;Coma&quot; (10:14) from the same album, and &quot;Estranged&quot; (9:24) from &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot;. It was the longest song ever to reach the top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 until November 2021, when surpassed by Taylor Swift&#x27;s extended rerecording of &quot;All Too Well&quot;. The song&#x27;s composition was influenced by Elton John&#x27;s 1973 opus &quot;Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding&quot;.

Its distinct symphonic overtone owes to a sweeping string arrangement, orchestrated by Rose. &quot;We call it &#x27;the Layla song&#x27;,&quot; joked Slash, referencing a similarly-constructed rock song with a long, instrumental second part. It was later preceded by the coda from Layla on the Not in This Lifetime... Tour.

On November 4, 2022, the original track was re-released on a &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot; reissue, but with newly recorded orchestration replacing the sampled sounds used on the original mix. The orchestration consists of a real 50-piece orchestra, conducted and arranged by Christopher Lennertz. The track was mixed by Steven Wilson.

==Critical reception==
Robert Hilburn from &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;This sweeping ballad – reminiscent of Elton John and Bernie Taupin’s most majestic work – underscores the ambition and range of the best and most volatile American hard-rock group in a decade.&quot; Dave Jennings from &quot;Melody Maker&quot; said, &quot;There&#x27;s probably no other band who can match the Gunners&#x27; ability to sound frighteningly real and then laughably crass in rapid succession. [...] On &quot;November Rain&quot;, they fit both extremes into one nine-minute epic ballad.&quot; Another editor, Simon Reynolds, declared it as &quot;a lush, swoony, mock-orchestral epic mid-way between Trevor Horn, Jim Steinman and &#x27;Purple Rain&#x27;.&quot; Parry Gettelman from &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; viewed it as &quot;a schlocky, over-produced ballad&quot;. Richard Harrington from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; felt that in the wake of their breakthrough power ballad &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot;, Guns N&#x27;Roses &quot;have wisely chosen to play to their female constituency&quot; with &quot;November Rain&quot;. He explained that the song &quot;finds Axl in an Elton John mood with a piano, synthesized strings and the realization that while &#x27;It&#x27;s hard to hold a candle/ in the cold November rain,&#x27; we should &#x27;never mind the darkness/ we can still find a way/ cause nothin&#x27; lasts forever/ even cold November rain.&#x27; On the other hand, at almost nine minutes, this song comes close.&quot;

==Chart performance==
In the United States, the song peaked at number three for two weeks in 1992, making it Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; sixth and last top-10 hit. It stayed in the top 10 for 10 weeks and on the Hot 100 for 30 weeks. The song also peaked at number nine in Germany and remained on the chart for 51 weeks. In Australia, &quot;November Rain&quot; was ranked at number two on the 1992 end-of-year chart despite only reaching number five on the ARIA Singles Chart. It was included on ARIA&#x27;s year-end charts in two consecutive years (1992 and 1993, when it appeared at 36). A similar situation took place in New Zealand, where the song peaked at number seven but stayed in the top 20 for 24 non-consecutive weeks, ending 1992 as New Zealand&#x27;s second-best-selling single.

==Music video==

The accompanying music video for &quot;November Rain&quot;, directed by Andy Morahan, was inspired by Del James&#x27;s short story &quot;Without You&quot;, for which he is credited in the long version of the video. The short story portrays a rock star struggling to come to terms with the loss of his girlfriend, who died by suicide (gunshot) after he repeatedly strayed from their relationship. &quot;November Rain&quot; is one of the most expensive music videos ever.

The video tells a story reminiscent of &quot;Without You&quot;, and features a live performance footage from Los Angeles&#x27; Orpheum Theater. First, in a silhouette, Rose&#x27;s character is seen going to bed and taking pills; a bottle of whisky is also visible next to him. The scene, now in color, changes to the wedding of the main characters, played by Rose and his then-girlfriend Stephanie Seymour. The other band members are among the many guests.

Slash&#x27;s character realizes he forgot the wedding rings, when McKagan&#x27;s character offers his rings as a substitute. After the wedding couple leaves the church, we see the wedding reception which is later interrupted by sudden, heavy rain, causing everyone to run for shelter.

The next scene shows a funeral at the same church. Rose&#x27;s character grieves at the death of his wife, now inside a casket with a mirrored object obscuring half of her face. A heavy rain falls upon the cemetery when the casket is laid to rest.

A final scene shows Seymour&#x27;s character back at the wedding, tossing her white bouquet, which turns red in the air and lands on her coffin. Black and white scenes Rose&#x27;s character&#x27;s nightmares show a mix of wedding and funeral scenes. The music video ends with Rose&#x27;s character kneeling beside her grave and the bouquet turns back to white as the rain washes the red color away.

For the outside shots of Slash&#x27;s first guitar solo, Rose had originally envisioned it taking place in a &quot;cool field&quot;. However, since the video was shot in winter, there were no good-looking fields around, and the band decided to film in New Mexico, where they had a church building transported specifically for the shoot. The larger church, for the wedding scenes, is Los Angeles&#x27; St. Brendan Catholic Church.

The music videos for &quot;November Rain&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; and &quot;Estranged&quot; form an unofficial trilogy of sorts. While never specifically confirmed by the band, Del James&#x27; short story &quot;Without You&quot; served as inspiration for the video, and received recognition in the video&#x27;s end credits.

In July 2018, the music video became the first video created prior to YouTube to surpass one billion views. In February 2023, the music video reached another milestone after it surpassed two billion views and remaining the oldest song (from the early 1990s) to achieve that feat.

The video was re-released in November 2022, with the newly-synced orchestration, to promote the &quot;Use Your Illusion (Super Deluxe Edition)&quot; box set.

==Live performances==

The band performed a nearly nine-minute live version of the song with British musician Elton John on piano at the end of the 1992 VMAs ceremony. On January 22, 2023, Rose performed a shortened, solo version of &quot;November Rain&quot; during the memorial service of Lisa Marie Presley in Graceland.

==Retrospective response==
&quot;November Rain&quot; was voted number one on the Rock 1000 2006, an annual countdown of the top 1,000 rock songs by New Zealand radio listeners. It was voted number two on the 2007 version, beaten by &quot;Back in Black&quot; by AC/DC. The song topped the &quot;album tracks&quot; section of a 1993 readers&#x27; poll in GN&#x27;R fanzine &quot;Controversy&quot;, beating &quot;Coma&quot;. The top ten was completed by &quot;Estranged&quot;, &quot;Civil War&quot;, &quot;Paradise City&quot;, &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot;, &quot;Patience&quot; and &quot;Mr. Brownstone&quot;.

The song placed number 140 on &quot;Pitchfork&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Top 200 Tracks of the 90s&quot;. In Chile, the song placed at number 73 on Chilean radio Rock &amp; Pop. In 2017, &quot;Paste&quot; ranked the song number nine on their list of the 15 greatest Guns N&#x27; Roses songs, and in 2020, &quot;Kerrang&quot; ranked the song number six on their list of the 20 greatest Guns N&#x27; Roses songs.

NPR described the song as &quot;one of the ultimate hard-rock power ballads&quot;, while VH1 added that the song &quot;is the sprawling, cosmic-reaching, just-so-insane-it-works hard rock epic toward which every previous single-track hard rock epic had led and from which every subsequent single-track hard rock epic has emerged&quot;. &quot;Glide Magazine&quot; named the song at second in their list of &quot;Favorite Hair-Metal Power Ballads&quot;.

As of October 2024, November Rain is the most viewed song on YouTube released in the 1990s.

<doc id="670342" wikidata="Q1385086" url="?curid=670342" title="Keiichi Tsuchiya">
<text>is a Japanese professional race car driver. He is known as the for his nontraditional use of drifting in non-drifting racing events and his role in popularizing drifting as a motorsport. In professional racing, he is a two-time 24 Hours of Le Mans class winner and the 2001 All Japan GT Championship runner-up. He is also known for touge driving.

The car he drives, a Toyota AE86 Sprinter Trueno, has become one of the most popular sports cars; the car is also known as &quot;Hachi-Roku&quot; in Japan (&quot;hachi-roku&quot; meaning &quot;eight-six&quot;); his car is also called &quot;The Little Hachi that could.&quot; A 2-part video known as &#x27;The Touge&#x27; produced by Pluspy (styled as +P) documents Tsuchiya&#x27;s touge driving with his AE86.

He was a consultant for the popular manga and anime series, &quot;Initial D&quot;, of which the main character Takumi Fujiwara is a character which describes him. He also served as a stunt coordinator and stuntman on &quot;The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift&quot;, where he also made a cameo appearance.

==Biography==
Tsuchiya started his career through the Fuji Freshman series in 1977. Unlike many drivers who came from wealthy families or motorsport backgrounds, he honed his skills from street racing and became noted in the underground scene.

===Racing career===
; National championships

He would continue to take part in the Japanese Formula Three Championship, Japanese Touring Car Championship (JTCC), the latter while driving a Cosmo Oil Sierra Cosworth and Nissan Skyline GT-R (Team Taisan) in the Group A championships and later a Honda Civic in the Supertouring car championships.

; Le Mans
He went on to score a class win and an 8th place overall at the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans in a Honda NSX. In the same race in 1999, this time in a Toyota GT-One, during the last hour while co-driver Ukyo Katayama was building up pace to the leading BMW V12 LMR he was forced into the grass by a backmarker privateer&#x27;s BMW LMR, blowing the tire out. They survived the ordeal and went on to score the fastest lap but were forced to settle for second.

; NASCAR
He has raced in NASCAR-sanctioned exhibition races at Suzuka Circuit (Suzuka Thunder 100) and at Twin Ring Motegi Superspeedway for the 1998 NASCAR-sanctioned exhibition and 1999 NASCAR Grand National Division, AutoZone West Series races at the circuit, both named the Coca-Cola 500K.

===Drifting career===
When Tsuchiya was a freshman in circuit racing, he was about to get his racing license suspended because of the illegal racing he was recording for Pluspy. In the movie series &quot;Shuto Kousoku Trial&quot;, he advised street racers to leave the illegal racing scene if they want to become involved with professional racing.

===After retirement===
After his retirement, he was Team Director for both GT500 for one year and GT300 Class of ARTA JGTC Team until the team disbanded their GT300 operation at the end of the 2005 season. He owned the aftermarket company Kei Office until he sold the business in the end of 2005 to form DG-5. After quitting D1 in January 2011, he co-founded amateur drifting series Drift Muscle, where he also worked as judge.

His trademark color is jade green, which appears on his overalls and helmet and is the adopted color of the former company. It was also the colour of the D1 Grand Prix Kei Office and DG-5 S15 Silvia of driver and employee Yasuyuki Kazama who also wears a suit similar in pattern.

He also hosts the video magazine &quot;Best Motoring&quot; which features road tests of new Japanese cars including a special section called &quot;Hot Version&quot; which focuses on performance-modified cars. He is a guest presenter in &quot;Video Option&quot; alongside fellow racing drivers Manabu Orido and Nobuteru Taniguchi, a monthly video magazine, similar to Hot Version except regularly covers the D1GP and its sister video magazine &quot;Drift Tengoku&quot; which deals purely with drifting.

He has been an editorial supervisor on the televised anime &quot;Initial D&quot; and &quot;Wangan Midnight.&quot; He also appeared in the semi biographical film &quot;Shuto Kousoku Trial&quot; 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 was also featured in the Super GT magazine show in Japan. His life in driving is parallel to that of the &quot;Initial D&quot; main character, Takumi, as both of them started exploring their local touge while doing regular deliveries for their family businesses. He makes a number of cameos in the series: in the First Stage, he briefly converses with Takumi&#x27;s father, Bunta; in the Third Stage, a motorcycle rider wearing a similar racing suit overtakes Takumi as he was en route to an invitation battle with Ryosuke Takahashi; and in the Final Stage, he meets Takumi in person while the latter spectates a circuit race in the end credits. The color of Tomo&#x27;s racing suit from the Initial D 4th Stage is jade green and has a similar pattern to Tsuchiya&#x27;s suit. He also made an appearance opposite Top Gear&#x27;s Jeremy Clarkson in a Motorworld in Japan special showing drifting competition in the mid 1990s in Japan.

After 1995, he sometimes appeared as a Formula One guest commentator in Japanese Fuji TV.

In 2006, he made a cameo as a fisherman in the movie &quot;The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift&quot; in which he served as a stuntman.

In 2014, he announced a joint venture with the King of Europe Drift ProSeries in order to create the King of Asia ProSeries. He would also act as one of the main judges for several important races in the King of Europe ProSeries, being called in as a guest representative throughout the years.

<text>The Fabulous Life Of... is a VH1 television series detailing the places, things, and services various celebrities enjoy. It first aired in 2003, with a special about Jennifer Lopez. The show is similar in format to &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous&quot;, albeit being narrated with mostly stills and file video, and without the cooperation of the profiled subjects.

The show is narrated by Christopher Flockton.

==&quot;Really Rich Real Estate&quot;==
&quot;The Fabulous Life Presents: Really Rich Real Estate&quot; is a spin-off focusing on the Westside Estate Agency and their wealthy celebrity clients. Frankie Muniz and Inge Bongo were featured in the first episode which premiered in November 2006. Unlike &quot;The Fabulous Life of...&quot;, which focuses on the celebrities themselves, this series focuses on a business which caters to celebrities and has a different tone and style. The houses are featured because someone wants to buy or sell them with Westside.

<doc id="670345" wikidata="Q931759" url="?curid=670345" title="Giant ibis">
<text>The giant ibis (Pseudibis gigantea) is a wading bird of the ibis family, Threskiornithidae. It is confined to northern Cambodia, with a few birds surviving in extreme southern Laos and a recent sighting in Yok Đôn National Park, Vietnam. It is sometimes placed in the genus &quot;Thaumatibis&quot;.

==Description==
True to its name, it is the largest extant ibis species. Adults are long and weigh about . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the tarsus is and the culmen is . The adults have overall dark grayish-brown plumage with a naked, greyish head and upper neck. There are dark bands across the back of the head and shoulder area and the pale silvery-grey wing tips also have black crossbars. The beak is yellowish-brown, the legs are orange, and the eyes are dark red. Juveniles have short black feathers on the back of the head down to the neck, shorter bills and brown eyes.

It has a loud, ringing call, frequently repeated around dawn or dusk, &quot;a-leurk a-leurk&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The giant ibis is a lowland bird that occurs in marshes, swamps, lakes, wide rivers, flooded plains and semi-open forests as well as pools, ponds and seasonal water-meadows in denser deciduous forest. It generally is found in lowlands. One bird was collected in a Malay paddyfield. Formerly the giant ibis was believed to breed in eastern Thailand, central and northern Cambodia, southern Laos and southern Vietnam. It was still fairly common in the Mekong Delta until the 1920s but is now almost depleted, with a small remnant population breeding in Cambodia, southern Laos and possibly in Vietnam.

==Behavious and ecology==

===Food and feeding===
The giant ibis eats aquatic invertebrates, eels, crustaceans and small amphibians and reptiles. Insects such as locusts and cicadas are eaten regularly when abundant and seeds occasionally supplement the diet. Outside of the breeding season, frogs and mole-crickets appear to be perhaps the most significant prey types for giant ibises. They mainly forage in muddy substrate in shallow waters, though can feed at all depths in seasonal forest pools. Feeding flocks may consist of a breeding pair or small family group and have been observed mixing with black ibises.

===Breeding===
Next to nothing is known of its breeding behaviour, but it nests in trees, with a possible preference for &quot;Dipterocarpus&quot; trees. Usually, nests are located at least from human habitations, although the species is not especially shy around or fearful of humans unless persistently harassed or hunted. Females lay two eggs at the start of the rainy season, around June to September. Earthworms taken from their mounds in wet grasslands appears to be an important food source for nesting ibises of this species. In general, the species is residential but can wander widely for food or in response to disturbances. The giant ibis is generally territorial and may remain with a family group throughout the year. However, in the dry season, when they are not nesting, groups of up to seven individuals, sometimes likely unrelated, have been observed feeding together.

==Status==
The giant ibis is considered to be Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. The primary causes seem to be drainage of wetlands for cultivation and the epidemic clear-cutting of forest for rubber, cassava, wood pulp and teak plantations in south-east Asia. Habitats may also face ravaging due to local human warfare. Increasing human populations in Cambodia have in turn lead to disturbance and further lowland deforestation. The ibis may be hunted for meat by people and eggs may be predated by the Asian palm civet and the yellow-throated marten, with the species certainly unable to withstand sustained predation. A reduction in seasonal pools in forest, previously made by now depleted populations of megafauna (especially wild Asian water buffalo), may also negatively effect them. Local droughts, possibly related to global climate change, have appeared to have further compromised the breeding habitat and behaviour of the species. Some conservation efforts have been undertaken, including protecting nests by the installation of metal belts that prevent predators from accessing them, but the protection of ideal habitat and the increasing human populations in Cambodia continues to be a vexing challenge. Increasing ecotourism in the region and education to local people is clearly required for the species to successfully recover from the brink of extinction. The current population is estimated at 100 pairs, with a total population (including young and juveniles) of fewer than 500 individuals. However, even these figures may be optimistic. In 2018 the IUCN stated there were less than 200 mature individuals in the population.

<doc id="670346" wikidata="Q1199501" url="?curid=670346" title="Technology tree">
<text>In strategy games, a technology, tech, or research tree is a hierarchical visual representation of the possible sequences of upgrades a player can unlock (most typically representing the research progress of a given faction). Because these trees are technically directed and acyclic, they can more accurately be described as a [[directed acyclic graph]] of technologies. The diagram is tree-shaped in the sense that it branches between each &#x27;level&#x27;, allowing the player to choose one sequence or another. Each level is called a &quot;tier&quot; and is often used to describe the technological strength of a player. Typically, at the beginning of a session of a strategy game, a player will start at tier 1, which offers only a few options for research. Each technology that a player researches will normally open up one or more new options, but may also, depending on the computer game, close off the paths to other options. The tech tree is the representation of all possible paths of research a player can take, up to the culmination of said sequence.

A player who is engaged in research activities is said to be &quot;teching up&quot;, &quot;going up the tech tree&quot;, or &quot;moving up the tech tree&quot;. Analysis of a tech tree can lead players to memorize and use specific build orders.

==Types==
===Classic research===
The Classic tech tree is the one where extensive research into new technologies must be conducted parallel to the progression of a game. Some real-time strategy (RTS) games as well as most turn-based strategy (TBS) games employ this type of tech tree. In these games, players typically have a &#x27;command center&#x27;, &#x27;unit-training-facility&#x27; and &#x27;research facility&#x27; at their disposal from the start, allowing them to both start research into more advanced technologies, or engaging in combat with enemies using the basic units (&quot;Warzone 2100&quot;, &quot;Mega Lo Mania&quot;, &quot;Master of Orion&quot; series, &quot;Civilization&quot; series, &quot;Space Empires&quot; series).

===Allocation===
In some games, the requirement of an actual research facility is absent. In this case players can allocate research points, or in-game resources to purchase new technologies. In some games the allocation yields direct results, meaning that procuring the new technology isn&#x27;t paired with allotted time for the research of said technology to complete.

===Building-based===
In most RTS games the technology tree consists of buildings which must be built in a specific sequence, which in turn unlocks new technologies. These newly unlocked technologies can be more advanced units, upgrades for research or more advanced buildings. (&quot;StarCraft&quot;, &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; series.)

===Prerequisites for technology advances===
In most types of strategy games, the player needs particular buildings in order to research specific technologies or build specific advanced units (&quot;StarCraft&quot;, &quot;Total Annihilation&quot;), while in other games upgrades/technologies are unlocked through research alone (&quot;Warzone 2100&quot;). In many TBS games the prerequisite is one or more lower-level technologies, with no dependency on specific buildings (&quot;Master of Orion&quot; series, &quot;Civilization&quot; series, &quot;Space Empires&quot; series).

===Complexity===

The structures of tech trees vary quite widely. In the simplest cases (e.g. &quot;Master of Orion&quot;) there are several completely separate research areas and one could research all the way up to the highest level in one area without researching other areas (although this would often be far from ideal). In more complex cases (e.g. &quot;Civilization&quot;) every technology above the starting level has more than one prerequisite and one has to research most of the lower-level technologies in order to research any of the top-level technologies. And there are many possibilities between these two variants, for example in &quot;Space Empires&quot; researching to a specified level in one field may enable the player both to research to a higher level in that field &quot;and&quot; to start research in a new field which was previously not available.

Major 4X games like &quot;Civilization&quot; and &quot;Master of Orion&quot; have a much larger technology tree than most other strategy games; as an extreme example, &quot;Space Empires III&quot; has over 200 technologies.

===Availability of technologies===

Some RTSs make different techs available to different races or cultures (especially &quot;StarCraft&quot;; but many RTSs have special units or buildings for different cultures, e.g. &quot;Age of Empires&quot; expansion pack and later versions, &quot;Red Alert 2&quot;). Most TBSs make all technologies available to all cultures (e.g. &quot;Civilization&quot;). &quot;Master of Orion&quot; (original version) is a complex special case in this respect: the full tree is the same for all; but in each game each player gets a subset of the full tech tree that depends on which race was selected.

===Balance between civilian and military techs===
In many RTS games tech advances are almost exclusively military (e.g. &quot;StarCraft&quot;). But in most TBS and some RTS games the research and production costs of top-end military techs are so high that you have to build up your economy and your research productivity first (RTS – &quot;Age of Empires&quot; and &quot;Empire Earth&quot;, where one of the most significant costs is going up an epoch; TBS – the &quot;Civilization&quot; series and &quot;Master of Orion&quot; series).

===What happens after researching everything ===
In many games there&#x27;s nothing useful to do and the player may scrap research centers to save maintenance costs and/or devote the resources to something else (&quot;Space Empires&quot; series).

In later installments of the &quot;Civilization&quot; series the last technology (called &quot;future tech&quot;) represents an amalgamation of all possible future discoveries and can be researched repeatedly. In &quot;Civilization V&quot;, it increases a player&#x27;s score, while in &quot;Civilization IV&quot; it raises the health and the happiness in the empire. Note that to reach the last technology in Civilization V, all spaceship technologies required to win must also have been discovered, so the game will likely be nearing its conclusion.

In the &quot;Galactic Civilizations&quot; series the final technology solves the nature of existence, and &quot;is&quot; victory.

In the &quot;Master of Orion&quot; series more advanced research reduces the size and cost of spaceship components, and &quot;hyper-advanced&quot; research in areas which have military applications therefore enables players to build more high-tech weapons into a given ship size and at lower production cost.

In &quot;Rise of Nations&quot;, the final four technologies result in such an advantage that the game will likely end quickly. Also, the &quot;knowledge&quot; resource needed to research is also used late in the game to produce cruise missiles and nuclear weapons.

== History ==
Typically the board game &quot;Civilization&quot; by Francis Tresham (1980) is given the credit of introducing a technology tree. &quot;Sid Meier’s Civilization&quot; (1991) is considered as an iconic computer turn-based strategy game for using them. Since &quot;Civilization&quot;, technology trees have been used in various digital games. Likewise, the first creation of a technology tree as a mechanism refers to &quot;Civilization&quot;.

The arcade shoot &#x27;em up &quot;Gradius&quot; used a power-up system functionally identical to a tech tree in 1985.

Tech trees started showing up in turn-based strategy games in the early 1990s. The 1991 video game &quot;Mega Lo Mania&quot; had a tech tree with a system of research levels/epochs that allowed the deployment of better units and defences and is considered to be the first game to combine a technology tree into a &quot;Real-time strategy&quot; game.

<text>John Cadwalader (January 10, 1742 – February 10, 1786) was a commander of Pennsylvania troops during the American Revolutionary War and served under George Washington. He was with Washington at Valley Forge.

==Early life==
John Cadwalader was born in Trenton, New Jersey of Quaker parentage, the eldest son of Thomas Cadwalader (1707–1779) and Hannah Lambert, his wife. In 1750, the Cadwalader family removed to Philadelphia where John and Lambert Cadwalader, his brother, were merchants. His paternal side of the family was Welsh, while his mother was from England.

In 1768 he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

==Career==

In 1776, Colonel John Cadwalader was elected senior officer of the Philadelphia Associators, a volunteer militia founded by Benjamin Franklin in 1747. By December, Cadwalader and the Associators were positioned about 10 miles south of Trenton on the west side of the Delaware River in Bucks County, Pennsylvania at the ferry between Bristol, Pennsylvania and Burlington, New Jersey. Cadwalader had received orders to send his column across the river on the night of December 25–26 and march to Trenton from the south. Meanwhile, George Washington&#x27;s column would cross the river to the north of Trenton and attack the city from that direction. After successfully crossing his light forces, Cadwalader discovered that river ice prevented crossing his artillery. He then returned his column to the Pennsylvania side, leaving Washington&#x27;s forces unsupported in New Jersey. It was fortunate for Washington that a Hessian column, having marched from their garrison at Bordentown to Mount Holly where they were engaged in the Battle of Iron Works Hill, were no longer in position to defend Trenton. Washington was successful in his surprise attack on the morning of December 26 against the Hessian garrison in Trenton.

Cadwalader and his column did cross the river the next day. Cadwalader subsequently took part in the further actions in New Jersey, which forced the British commander General William Howe and his principal subordinate, Lord Cornwallis, to surrender the colony to the Americans.
After the Conway Cabal, he fought a duel with Thomas Conway in 1778 in which Cadwalader wounded his opponent with a shot in the mouth. Supposedly Cadawalader, a supporter of Washington throughout the cabal, boasted, &quot;I have stopped that damned rascal&#x27;s lying anyway&quot; as he stood over the bleeding Conway.

===Post-war===
In 1779, Cadwalader became a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania and returned to his estate on the banks of the Sassafras River at Shrewsbury, Kent County, Maryland. He became a member of the Maryland State Assembly.

==Personal life==

On September 25, 1768, John Cadwalader married Elizabeth Lloyd (1742–1776), the daughter of Edward Lloyd, of Talbot County, Maryland. Her brother, Edward Lloyd IV, was a delegate to the Continental Congress for Maryland. Among their children were:

* Anne Cadwalader (b. 1771)
* Elizabeth Cadwalader (b. 1774)
* Maria Cadwalader (1776–1811), who married Samuel Ringgold, who became a congressman representing Maryland. Two of their sons, Samuel Ringgold and Cadwalader Ringgold, had distinguished military careers.

After the death of his first wife, Cadwalader married Williamina Bond (1753–1837) in 1779. She was a daughter of Dr. Phineas Bond, of Philadelphia and niece of Thomas Bond. Together, they were the parents of: 

* Thomas Cadwalader (1779–1841), who became a general of the Pennsylvania militia. 
* Frances Cadwalader (1781–1843), who married the Hon. David Erskine in 1799. He served as the British Ambassador to the United States from 1807 to 1809 before succeeding as the 2nd Baron Erskine in 1823.
* John Cadwalader (b. 1784)

Cadwalader died February 10, 1786, of pneumonia. He is buried at Shrewsbury Chapel, Kent County, Maryland. Thomas Paine wrote his epitaph:

His early and inflexible patriotism will endear his memory to all true friends of the American Revolution. It may with strictest justice be said of him, that he possessed a heart incapable of deceiving. His manners were formed on the nicest sense of honor and the whole tenor of his life was governed by this principle. The companions of his youth were the companions of his manhood. He never lost a friend by insincerity nor made one by deception. His domestic virtues were truly exemplary and while they served to endear the remembrances they embitter the loss of him to all his numerous friends and connections.

===Descendants===
Through his daughter Frances, he was a grandfather of Thomas Americus Erskine, 3rd Baron Erskine (1802–1877), and John Cadwalader Erskine, 4th Baron Erskine (1804–1882), Edward Morris Erskine (1817–1883), and James Stuart Erskine (1821–1904), who was created Graf Erskine by King Ludwig II of Bavaria.

===Slaveholding===
The Cadwalader family papers at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania detail and contextualize Cadwalader&#x27;s slaveholding. A personal estate inventory lists each of Cadwalader’s enslaved people by name and age, in total 107 women, children, and men.

===Legacy ===
John and Elizabeth Cadwalader built a city house on 2nd between Spruce &amp; Union (now Delancey) Streets in Philadelphia in 1770, and they commissioned suites of furniture from cabinetmakers such as Thomas Affleck and Benjamin Randolph. Surviving pieces are among the finest and best-documented Philadelphia Chippendale furniture ever made. &quot;Colonial Grandeur in Philadelphia: The House and Furniture of General John Cadwalader&quot; (The Historical Society of Pennsylvania, 1964) Examples are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Winterthur Museum, and other collections. A Cadwalader easy (wing) chair with hairy-paw feet by Affleck sold at Sotheby&#x27;s New York for $2.75 million on January 31, 1987, setting a world record for the highest price ever paid for any piece of furniture at auction.

<doc id="670355" wikidata="Q5610758" url="?curid=670355" title="Groton–New London Airport">
<text>Groton–New London Airport is a state-owned public-use airport located three nautical miles (6 km) southeast of the central business district of Groton, a town in New London County, Connecticut, United States. It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021, in which it is categorized as a regional general aviation facility. It serves the southeastern Connecticut region, including the shoreline localities of Groton, New London, and Mystic.

The airport has not had scheduled service since 2004, when US Air ceased service to the airport. Despite this loss, CTDOT/CAA continue to operate Groton-New London to commercial airport standards in an effort to keep the airport open and prepared for the possible return of commercial passenger service. 

Groton-New London Airport has been used by several presidents speaking at the commencement of the nearby US Coast Guard Academy.

== History ==
Groton–New London Airport was established as the first State of Connecticut airport in 1929. Originally called Trumbull Airport after Governor Jonathan Trumbull, the airport was taken over by the United States Army Air Corps in August 1941 as a First Air Force group training base, although the runways were still grass. In 1942, the Army constructed a base and hard-surfaced runways and designated the airport as Groton Army Airfield. Through all of 1943, a total of 10 squadrons of P-47 Thunderbolt fighter groups trained at the field, with the last unit departing for overseas combat in January 1944.

In January 1944, the USAAF turned the airfield to the United States Navy. The commissioning of Groton as a Naval Airfield occurred on February 1, 1944, as an auxiliary of Quonset Point. Initially, Groton hosted various individual squadrons. Later, entire CAGs of three or four squadrons formed up at the base. The CAGs attached here during the war included CAG 83, 10, 92, 152, and 4, with their F6Fs, F4Us, SB2Cs, and TBMs. CASU 28, on board in support of the CAGs, operated one OS2U Kingfisher, one J4F Widgeon, 12 SNJs, and one NH Howard. The station had one airplane assigned, a GH Howard.

In March 1944, station personnel consisted of 87 officers and 678 enlisted men with barracks for 114 officers and 1,091 men. The peak number of aircraft reached 114 in March 1945. Groton had three concrete runways: two 4,000 ft and one of 5,000 ft. In July 1946, the Navy returned the airport to the State of Connecticut.

In 1980, the name of the airport changed to Groton–New London Airport. Today, the airport is one of two state-owned airports with commercial air carrier service. The funds necessary to operate Groton–New London Airport come from the Connecticut State Transportation Fund. Likewise, revenue derived from the airport is returned to the Transportation Fund.

The airport is integrated into the statewide transportation plan, as well as the National Airport System Plan. There were 80,319 aircraft operations during 1999 at Groton–New London Airport which included military, general aviation and commercial flights. The terminal building was last renovated in 1997, with a new roof, HVAC system, ADA compliance, new carpeting and other improvements. The terminal is mostly a single floor structure, with a second floor that houses offices in one section. 

== Facilities and aircraft ==


Groton–New London Airport covers an area of 489 acres (198 ha) at an elevation of 9.1 feet (2.8 m) above mean sea level. It has two asphalt paved runways: 5/23 is 5,000 by 150 feet (1,524 x 46 m) and 15/33 is 4,000 by 100 feet (1,219 x 30 m). EMAS is installed on both ends of runway 5/23. 

For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2009, the airport had 38,582 aircraft operations, an average of 105 per day: 87% general aviation, 10% military, and 4% air taxi. At that time there were 30 aircraft based at this airport: 63% single-engine, 17% multi-engine, 10% jet, 3% helicopter, and 7% military.

The Connecticut Wing of the Civil Air Patrol Thames River Composite Squadron (NER-CT-075) operates out of the airport. 

Groton-New London has been home to the Connecticut National Guard’s 1109th Theater Aviation Support Maintenance Group (abbreviated as &quot;TASMG&quot;) since August 1st 1979 when the groups location was changed to the airport when it was converted and redesignated from &quot;Detachment 1, 1109th Transportation Company&quot; to Detachment 1, Groton Connecticut Army Aviation Classification and Repair Depot. In March 2012 the detachment was reorganized and redesignated to Connecticut Army National Guard 1109th Aviation Group.

== Scheduled air service ==
Over the years, and usually no more than one at a time, various domestic airlines served the airport, including Pan Am Clipper Connection, NewAir, Allegheny Airlines, Piedmont, and Pilgrim Airlines. Scheduled commercial passenger service was limited to small turboprop aircraft such as de Havilland Dash 8 and Beechcraft 1900, with service to Boston, New York, Philadelphia, or Washington, DC. After the 1996 expansion of T. F. Green Airport and the popularity of Southwest Airlines, the Groton airport ceased to be a profitable destination. US Airways Express, the last scheduled carrier to serve the airport, terminated its GON–PHL service in 2004. Charter services are available through the onsite fixed-base operator.

== Fixed-base operators ==
Columbia Air Services (since 1983) and Lanmar Aviation (since 2003) have been the two fixed-base operators serving the airport. In 2012, faced with declining demand for services, the two proposed merging their Groton operations as a joint venture called Mystic Jet Center. In January 2013, the U.S Department of Justice&#x27;s Antitrust Division announced that it would not interfere with the merger, citing sufficient competition from nearby airports.

<doc id="670357" wikidata="Q3295988" url="?curid=670357" title="The Yes Album">
<text>The Yes Album is the third studio album by English progressive rock band Yes, released in the UK on 19 February 1971 and in the US on 19 March 1971 by Atlantic Records. It was the band&#x27;s first album to feature guitarist Steve Howe, who replaced Peter Banks in 1970, as well as their last to feature keyboardist Tony Kaye until 1983&#x27;s &quot;90125&quot;.

The band spent mid-1970 writing and rehearsing new material at a farmhouse at Romansleigh, Devon, and the new songs were recorded at Advision Studios in London in the autumn. The album was the first by the band to feature all-original material. While the album retained close harmony singing, Kaye&#x27;s Hammond organ, and Chris Squire&#x27;s melodic bass, as heard on earlier releases, the new material also covered further styles including jazz piano, funk, and acoustic music. All of the band members contributed ideas, and tracks were extended in length to allow music to develop. Howe contributed a variety of guitar styles, including a Spanish laúd, and recorded the solo acoustic guitar piece &quot;Clap&quot;, live at the Lyceum Theatre, London.

The album was a critical success and a major commercial breakthrough for Yes, who had been at risk of being dropped by Atlantic due to the commercial failures of their first two albums. It reached number 4 in the United Kingdom and number 40 in the United States, and was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for surpassing one million copies. The album has been reissued on CD several times, and was given a Blu-ray release in 2014 remixed by Steven Wilson.

==Background==
Yes had already recorded two albums for Atlantic Records by mid-1970, but neither had been commercially successful and the label was considering dropping them. They had replaced founding member Banks with Howe, who enjoyed playing a wider variety of styles, including folk and country music, and played a mix of electric and acoustic guitars. Singer Jon Anderson later said that Howe could &quot;jump from one thing to the other, very fast, very talented.&quot; After some warm-up gigs with Howe, the band moved to Devon to write and rehearse new material. They arrived at a cottage in Churchill, north of Barnstaple, but felt restricted there and were not allowed to make any noise after dark. They advertised in the local paper for a new location, and moved to Langley Farm in Romansleigh, near South Molton, some away. Howe in particular enjoyed working on the farm, and eventually bought it. Following rehearsals, the band booked Advision Studios in London with producer Eddie Offord and spent the autumn recording. The band enjoyed the sessions, and soon had enough material ready for an album.

Several weeks into the Langley Farm rehearsals, manager Roy Flynn came to tell the band he was leaving them and taking money he believed he was owed. This put the band under severe financial stress, leaving concerts as their only source of income at the time. Flynn also owned 5 per cent of the band&#x27;s publishing revenues in perpetuity; that was later terminated but it left the band bitter enough to retitle a short Bill Bruford instrumental on their next album, &quot;Fragile&quot;, &quot;Five Per Cent for Nothing&quot; in protest. Flynn was soon replaced by Brian Lane.

On 23 November 1970, the group were involved in a head-on vehicle collision at Basingstoke, while returning from the previous evening&#x27;s gig at the Plymouth Guildhall. The band all suffered shock, and Kaye&#x27;s foot was fractured. He had to do the next few gigs, and the album cover&#x27;s photo shoot, with it in plaster.

Howe mostly used a Gibson ES-175 semi-acoustic guitar and a Martin 00-18 acoustic for recording, though he did attempt to play a variety of styles with the two instruments. Squire played a 1964 Rickenbacker RM1999 bass with Rotosound Swing Bass steel roundwound strings. His amplification was a Marshall 100W tube head with 4x12 cabinets. Kaye&#x27;s main instruments were the Hammond organ and piano, including a solo on &quot;A Venture&quot;. Kaye had previously played the Hammond M-100, but for this album used the B-3, a move which he saw as &quot;a turning point&quot;. He was not interested in playing synthesizers, which had started to appear on the market. This proved to be a problem with the other members of the band, and Kaye thought his style conflicted too much with Howe&#x27;s. He left the group during rehearsals for the follow-up album in mid-1971, to be replaced by Rick Wakeman.

==Songs==
Yes had started their career as a covers band, performing radical re-arrangements of hit songs, and their first two albums included covers in this vein. &quot;The Yes Album&quot; was the first to feature group-written material in its entirety. Some familiar elements remained: Anderson, Howe and Squire sang three-part vocal harmony throughout the record, while Squire&#x27;s melodic bass and Bill Bruford&#x27;s spacious drumming made up their unique rhythm section.

&quot;Yours Is No Disgrace&quot; originated from some lyrics written by Anderson with his friend David Foster. This was combined with other short segments of music written by the band in rehearsals. Howe worked out the opening guitar riff on his own while the rest of the band took a day&#x27;s holiday. The backing track was recorded by the group in sections, then edited together to make up the final piece.

Howe&#x27;s solo acoustic tune, &quot;Clap&quot; (incorrectly titled &quot;The Clap&quot; in original album pressings), was influenced by Chet Atkins and Mason Williams&#x27; &quot;Classical Gas&quot;. The piece was written to celebrate the birth of Howe&#x27;s son Dylan on 4 August 1969. The version that appears on the album was recorded live at the Lyceum Theatre in London on 17 July 1970. The studio take of the piece, which was added as a bonus track on the 2003 Rhino remaster, continues into a section that would return almost unaltered in Howe&#x27;s next solo acoustic piece &quot;Mood for a Day&quot; on their next album, &quot;Fragile&quot;.

The spacey, electronic-sounding effect in &quot;Starship Trooper&quot; was achieved by running the guitar backing track through a flanger. Anderson wrote the bulk of the song, while Squire wrote the &quot;Disillusion&quot; section in the middle. The closing section, &quot;Würm&quot; is a continuous cadenza of chords (G-E-C) played ad lib. It evolved from a song called &quot;Nether Street&quot; by Howe&#x27;s earlier group, Bodast.
&quot;I&#x27;ve Seen All Good People&quot; is a suite of two tunes. Anderson wanted the piece to start quietly and develop, leading into a large church organ sound, before moving into the funky second movement. The band had difficulty recording the initial &quot;Your Move&quot; section, which was resolved by making a tape loop of bass and drums, over which Howe overdubbed a Spanish laúd, miscrediting it as a &quot;vachalia&quot; on the album&#x27;s credits. Gnidrolog&#x27;s Colin Goldring played recorder on the track. The group also used a Dewtron bass pedal synthesiser on the track, which Anderson would then play in concert.

Anderson wrote &quot;A Venture&quot; in the studio; the song was then arranged by the rest of the band. Kaye played piano on the track, contributing a jazzy solo towards the end. Howe played a guitar solo on the original recording, but it was left off the final mix, which faded out just as it started. The song was never played live by the original group, but an arrangement was worked out when Yes decided to play the whole album live in 2013.

Anderson was inspired to write the lyrics for &quot;Perpetual Change&quot; by the view of the countryside from the cottage at Churchill. He thought of humans completing the Moon landing at a time when &quot;our own environment is all fouled up&quot;, and a space mission that involved an explosion on the Moon to observe its thickness and the subsequent Pakistani floods in 1970. &quot;So I was thinking, ok you knock the moon off its axis and you&#x27;re going to mess up the world.&quot; The song&#x27;s familiar opening chords, Gsus4 and Asus4, are simultaneously played on the guitar and organ. The middle of the track features a polyrhythmic structure, where two pieces of music in different time signatures are playing simultaneously.

==Artwork==
The front cover was shot by Phil Franks the day after the Basingstoke gig accident. Franks had already taken some photos from the Lyceum gig, but felt he needed something more for the front cover. The band showed up late having been in hospital earlier that day, and only 30 minutes were available for a shoot. Unable to get a satisfactory photo in the studio, Franks took the band round to his flat, grabbed a polystyrene mannequin head from a bin, put a 1,000 watt bulb in the kitchen light fitting, and improvised the shot. Franks credited the sleeve designer, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; art director Jon Goodchild, for making the cover a success. When Yes performed a live version of &quot;Yours is No Disgrace&quot; for the German television series &quot;Beat-Club&quot; in April 1971, footage of the band was combined with that of another mannequin head spinning over a chair, mimicking the cover&#x27;s concept.

The inside of the album&#x27;s gatefold sleeve shows Kaye playing a Hammond organ, while the front cover showed his leg in plaster, following the accident. Anderson is credited as &quot;John Anderson&quot; on the album but he had dropped the &quot;h&quot; from his first name by the next album, &quot;Fragile&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;The Yes Album&quot; was released in the UK on 19 February 1971. It was a commercial success and was the band&#x27;s breakthrough album, selling around 60,000 copies upon release and reaching number 4 in the UK. and number 40 in the US. It has been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling over one million copies.

At that time British postal workers were on strike, preventing record stores from sending sales reports to &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, which compiled the charts most followed by the music industry. Richard Branson owned a record store on Oxford Street in London, the first business enterprise in what he later built up into Virgin Group. He began compiling a chart from sales at his store and several others; in the interim the BBC and other media used it. Lane, newly hired as the band&#x27;s manager, promised them he would get their album in the charts, and did so by buying enough copies of it at the Virgin store to make it the bestselling album there and thus put it high in the charts. By the time the strike had ended, the album had started to sell well due to its initial apparent success. It remained on the charts for 34 weeks, selling over a million copies.

===Reception===
The album had a positive reception from critics. John Koegel, writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, praised the instrumental unity between Squire, Howe and Kaye, but missed the cover songs present in the band&#x27;s earlier albums. The album is one of three by Yes to appear in the book &quot;1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die&quot;. Author Tom Moon preferred the group unity that he felt was missing on later releases and gave a positive impression of Anderson&#x27;s vocals, saying the melodies in &quot;I&#x27;ve Seen All Good People&quot; were &quot;instantly singable and still somehow deep.&quot; The album is also featured in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.
In 2000 it was voted number 317 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

Anderson was worried about the initial response to the album, but after about a month noticed that fans started singing along at concerts, and concluded that this musical style could be developed and still remain popular. Kaye concluded that overall it was &quot;quite a simple album, considering where Yes went onto from there.&quot; Rush singer and bassist Geddy Lee included &quot;The Yes Album&quot; among his favourite albums. Genesis keyboardist Tony Banks has said it is his favourite Yes album and that he preferred the band when Kaye was a member. &quot;It was the addition of Steve Howe&#x27;s guitar pyrotechnics that finally allowed Yes to find their true identity. &quot;The Yes Album&quot; is a giant leap forward,&quot; wrote J. D. Considine in&quot; The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;.

===Reissues===
&quot;The Yes Album&quot; was remastered and reissued in 2003 by Rhino Records with several bonus tracks, including a studio version of &quot;Clap&quot;, entitled as Howe intended. In 2014, Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree created a new stereo mix and a 5.1 surround sound mix, available as either a DVD or Blu-ray Disc. It was released on 21 April with bonus tracks including the studio version of &quot;Clap&quot;, an extended version of &quot;A Venture&quot;, and an alternate version of the album with live tracks, single edits, and an extended mix. The Blu-ray version also features an instrumental version of the album, a needle drop sample of the original vinyl release, and additional live tracks. More recently, it was reissued in 2023 as a super deluxe edition, featuring the original album, instrumental tracks, studio recordings, live recordings, remixes, and other bonus tracks.

<doc id="670359" wikidata="Q5160061" url="?curid=670359" title="Confianza">
<text>Confianza (English: trust) is a Latin American form of mutual reciprocity. In the context of interpersonal relationships, its presence indicates that both parties recognize a mutual duty to honor their relationship by extending specially favorable treatment.

==Cross-cultural theory==
Some cross-cultural theorists state that many European and North American cultures are based on universal expectations of individual conduct. &quot;I cannot hire my relatives to work in a public institution in my care, and, in theory, even my friends I should treat equally to strangers.&quot; Social obligations are dictated on the basis of norms or rules which are considered of a higher order, transcending the &quot;accidents&quot; of relationship, such as personal acquaintance, shared origin or family ties between people. &quot;If I am an electrical repairperson, I must service my list of clients in the order received because doing so is fair. If I am a police officer, I give my acquaintances tickets because I am a police officer and that&#x27;s my job.&quot;
==Ties that bind==
Many people in the traditional Latin culture are particularist in that the most important factor influencing what individuals can do is whose trust they have gained either through conduct or through affinity networks. In the Dominican Republic, for instance, if I know a police officer, and I &quot;tengo confianza&quot; in him, then I may be able to have fewer problems with the law. &quot;Todo se hace por la buena confianza y relaciones que uno las tiene con otros,&quot; or &quot;Everything gets done based on the trust and good relationships one has with others.&quot; If the electricity goes out, it is helpful to know someone at the power company. Social obligations are dictated based on social relationships with others. &quot;I do helpful things for my friends because friendship makes life great.&quot; Everyone needs a bit of help sometimes, after all.

==Breach of trust==
&quot;Confianza&quot; (mixture of familiarity and trust) is especially evident in the phrase &quot;abuso de confianza&quot; (abuse of trust), which is the presumption of a relationship beyond the expectation of the other person. It is another of network of subtle, implicit, unstated relational expectations characteristic of the Latin cultures. Another one is the invisible bond between patron, &quot;padrino&quot; or &quot;caudillo&quot; and their protégés, &quot;ahijados&quot; or followers, a vestigial form of the liege that serfs owed the feudal lords and their reciprocal obligation to take care of their vassals, especially in times of need.

<text>The National Museum of Ireland () is Ireland&#x27;s leading museum institution, with a strong emphasis on national and some international archaeology, Irish history, Irish art, culture, and natural history. It has three branches in Dublin, the archaeology and natural history museums adjacent on Kildare Street and Merrion Square, and a newer Decorative Arts and History branch at the former Collins Barracks, and the Country Life museum in County Mayo.

== History ==
===Predecessors===
The National Museum of Ireland descends from the amalgamation of parts of the collections of a number of Dublin cultural institutions from the 18th and 19th centuries, including primarily the Royal Dublin Society (RDS) and the Royal Irish Academy (RIA). The earliest parts of the collections are largely geological and mineralogical specimens, which the RDS collected as a means to improve the knowledge and use of such resources in Ireland. The establishment of the museum collections is generally deemed to have begun with the purchase of the collection of Nathanael Gottfried Leske in 1792.

One of the earliest iterations of the RDS museum was at Hawkins Street House, where the Leskean Cabinet was displayed along with a collection of casts and busts. This exhibition was open to the public between noon and 3pm, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Aside from the exhibition, there was a lecture hall, laboratory and library. From here, the museum moved to Leinster House in 1815 when the RDS purchased it from the 3rd Duke of Leinster. Here the Leskean Cabinet continued to be displayed, along with newly accessioned collections from professor of mineralogy and geology, Charles Lewis Giescke, curiosities, and the Hibernicum which was a display of minerals and geological specimens from the island of Ireland.

===Name and new building===
Giescke was the first to refer to the museum as the &quot;National Museum of Ireland&quot;, in 1832, in his catalogue of the entomology and ornithology specimens. After Giescke&#x27;s death in 1833, John Scouler was appointed curator in 1834. During this time the collections were open to the public two days a week from noon to 3pm, and to students at all times. 

By this time the need for a new museum was deemed to be critical. This led to the construction of the building which now houses the Natural History Museum on Merrion Street. With the planned expansion and development of the museum, Scouler requested that a curator or Director be employed by the RDS. This led to the appointment of Alexander Carte in 1851. Carte overhauled and reorganised the collections, overseeing acquisitions from Sir Francis McClintock, Sir William Wilde, and Sir Richard Griffith.

The museum took part in the International Exhibition of Art-Industry of 1853, exhibiting objects in the &quot;Hall of Antiquities&quot;, along with the RIA. Following this the museum opened five days a week to the public. 
The &quot;Science and Art Museum&quot; was established in 1877, becoming the &quot;National Museum of Science and Art&quot; in 1900, and the &quot;National Museum of Ireland&quot; after independence. It also included the collection of the &quot;Museum of Irish Industry&quot;, which had been founded in 1847. The collections of both the RIA and RDS formed the basis for the &quot;Archaeology and History&quot; section of the Museum at Kildare Street. This is the site originally opened in 1890 as the &quot;Dublin Museum of Science and Art&quot;, in the building designed by Sir Thomas Newenham Deane and his son, Thomas Manly Deane. Until 1922, the museum complex also included Leinster House, now the home of the Oireachtas.

===After independence===
The museum operated in the buildings at Kildare Street and Merrion Square until the late 20th century projects at Collins Barracks and County Mayo. As of 1975, the visitable collections were summarised as &quot;Primary: Irish antiquities and history, fine arts (excluding painting and sculpture) and natural history (excluding botany), and additionally: Egyptian, Greek and Roman antiquities, Far Eastern art and ceramics, and ethnography and zoology,&quot; with an additional collection of folk life material not on display. The museum published occasional works focusing on particular parts of the collection, archaeological acquisitions and one volume on the role of the museum.

==Divisions==
&quot;See also :Category:Collection of the National Museum of Ireland&quot;
The museum operates at four locations, each with a thematic focus:
*National Museum of Ireland – Archaeology, Kildare Street, Dublin
*National Museum of Ireland – Decorative Arts and History, Arbour Hill, Dublin
*National Museum of Ireland – Natural History, Merrion Street, Dublin
*National Museum of Ireland – Country Life, near Castlebar

===Archaeology===
The National Museum of Ireland – Archaeology on Kildare Street has displays on prehistoric Ireland, including early work in gold, church treasures and objects from the Viking and medieval periods. The Kingship and Sacrifice exhibition includes well preserved bog bodies and Ralaghan Man. There are special displays of items from Egypt, Cyprus and the Roman world, and special exhibitions are regularly mounted.

This section includes famous examples of early medieval Celtic metalwork in Ireland such as the Ardagh Chalice, the Tara Brooch, and the Derrynaflan Hoard. Prehistoric pieces include the Iron Age Broighter Gold and over 50 gold lunulas (not all on display), and other Bronze Age jewellery. Many of these pieces were found in the 19th century by poor people or agricultural labourers, when population expansion led to the cultivation of land which had not been touched since the Middle Ages. Indeed, without the intervention of George Petrie of the Royal Irish Academy and like-minded individuals from the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, most of the metalwork would have been melted down for the intrinsic value of its materials, as did frequently happen despite their efforts. Contemporary Irish are more tuned to their heritage, as can be seen in the example of the Irish Bog Psalter, which was discovered and reported by an alert machine operator in July 2006.

The museum is home to the mummy of an egyptian woman named Tentdinebu.

=== Decorative Arts and History ===
National Museum of Ireland – Decorative Arts and History, including the Great Seal of the Irish Free State, is the part of the collection kept at the large Collins Barracks site, a former military barracks named after Michael Collins in 1922. This site, opened in 1997, also holds the Museum&#x27;s administrative centre, a shop and a coffee shop.

This section has displays of furniture, silver, ceramics and glassware, as well as examples of folk life and costume, and money and weapons. A Chinese porcelain vase from about 1300 AD, the Fonthill vase, is one of the features. The Soldiers &amp; Chiefs exhibition features military artefacts and memorabilia tracing Ireland&#x27;s military history from 1550 to the present. Special exhibitions are mounted regularly; in summer 2007, for example, replicas of six Irish High Crosses that were subsequently shown internationally.

=== Natural History Museum ===

The Natural History Museum, which is part of the National Museum, although often thought of as distinct, is on Merrion Street in Dublin and houses specimens of animals from around the world. It is also known as the Dead Zoo by locals. Its collection and Victorian appearance have not changed significantly since the early 20th century.

=== Country Life ===
Country Life is the most recent part of the museum to be opened. It is located just outside Turlough village, on the N5 eight kilometres east of Castlebar, in County Mayo, and was opened in 2001.

The museum is focused on ordinary life from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century, with much of the material coming from rural Ireland in the 1930s. There are displays on the home, the natural environment, communities and forces for change.

==Organisation==
The Museum is overseen by a board of directors, of whom two are nominated by the Royal Irish Academy and one by the Royal Dublin Society, both of which have contributed significantly to the institution; the remainder are appointed by the relevant minister. 

It is led operationally by a Director, under whom are a &quot;Head of Collections and Learning&quot; and a &quot;Head of Operations&quot;. Reporting to the Head of Collections and Learning are the Keepers of Antiquities, Art &amp; Industry, Natural History, and Folklife, the Registrar, and the Heads of Conservation, Education, Design and Photography. Within Operations are the Heads of Facilities, Human Resources, Finance, Corporate Affairs, Marketing, Commercial Development and ICT.

<text>Robert C. Peniston (October 25, 1922 – August 2, 2014) was a career United States Navy officer who rose to the rank of captain and commanded the battleship USS &quot;New Jersey&quot;.

Born on October 25, 1922, in Chillicothe, Missouri, Peniston attended the University of Wichita, then joined the Navy in 1943.

Peniston graduated with the Class of 1947 from the U.S. Naval Academy. Among other assignments, he served as navigator of the presidential yacht &quot;Williamsburg&quot; in 1952. He commanded the destroyer escort USS Savage (DE-386) and the guided missile destroyer USS &quot;Tattnall&quot;. He was the second captain for the recommissioned USS &quot;Albany&quot;, which was restored to service as a guided missile cruiser on November 9, 1968. He took command of &quot;New Jersey&quot; on August 27, 1969, and helped decommission her on December 17, 1969, with these words: &quot;Rest well, yet sleep lightly; and hear the call, if again sounded, to provide firepower for freedom.&quot; (New Jersey was recommissioned in the 1980s). He retired from the Navy as a captain in 1976.

Along the way, Peniston earned an M.A. from Stanford University in 1958, and also attended the Naval War College.

Peniston became director of the Lee Chapel at Washington and Lee University, retired again, and subsequently began volunteering in the Special Collections section of the college&#x27;s Leyburn Library, where he transcribed more than 3,000 letters from the library&#x27;s Robert E. Lee collection and Lee-Jackson Foundation Papers. As well, he occasionally spoke to American History classes at the college.

Peniston died August 2, 2014, in Lexington, Virginia.

<text>Jean-Frédéric Émile Oustalet (24 August 1844 – 23 October 1905) was a French zoologist who contributed greatly to ornithology.

Oustalet was born at Montbéliard, in the department of Doubs. He studied at the Ecole des Hautes-Etudes and his first scientific work was on the respiratory organs of dragonfly larvae. He was employed at the Muséum National d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle, where he succeeded Jules Verreaux as assistant-naturalist in 1875. In 1900 he succeeded Alphonse Milne-Edwards as Professor of Mammalogy. 
Oustalet became especially interested in birds after the museum received new specimens from Indo-China and Africa. He took a special interest in the birds of China and co-authored &quot;Les Oiseaux de la Chine&quot; (1877) with Armand David, and also wrote &quot;Les Oiseaux du Cambodge&quot; (1899). He described a specimen from Branco as a separate species &quot;Passer brancoensis&quot; in 1883, which was recognised as the subspecies &quot;Passer iagoensis brancoensis&quot; by W. R. P. Bourne, who claimed to observe differences between Iago sparrows from different islands.

Oustalet attended the International Ornithological Congress at Vienna (1884), Budapest (1891), London (1905) and presided in Paris (1900). 

The duck species &quot;Anas oustaleti&quot; was named after him. A species of Malagasy chameleon, &quot;Furcifer oustaleti&quot;, was named in his honor by François Mocquard in 1894.

Oustalet died at St. Cast (Cotes-du-Nord) after several weeks of illness. The funeral was held in Montbeliard (Doubs).

<doc id="670364" wikidata="Q948922" url="?curid=670364" title="Single-line diagram">
<text>In power engineering, a single-line diagram (SLD), also sometimes called one-line diagram, is a simplest symbolic representation of an electric power system. A single line in the diagram typically corresponds to more than one physical conductor: in a direct current system the line includes the supply and return paths, in a three-phase system the line represents all three phases (the conductors are both supply and return due to the nature of the alternating current circuits). 

The one-line diagram has its largest application in power flow studies. Electrical elements such as circuit breakers, transformers, capacitors, bus bars, and conductors are shown by standardized schematic symbols. Instead of representing each of three phases with a separate line or terminal, only one conductor is represented. 

It is a form of block diagram graphically depicting the paths for power flow between entities of the system. Elements on the diagram do not represent the physical size or location of the electrical equipment, but it is a common convention to organize the diagram with the same left-to-right, top-to-bottom sequence as the switchgear or other apparatus represented. A one-line diagram can also be used to show a high level view of conduit runs for a PLC control system.

== Buses ==
The lines in the single-line diagram connect &quot;nodes&quot; – points in the system that are &quot;electrically distinct&quot; (i.e., there is nonzero electrical impedance between them). For sufficiently large systems, these points represent physical busbars, so the diagram nodes are frequently called buses. A bus corresponds to a location where the power is either injected into the system (e.g., a generator) or consumed (an electrical load). A steady-state of each bus can be characterized by its voltage phasor; the &quot;system state&quot; is defined by a vector of voltage phasors for all the buses. In a physical system the state is calculated through power system state estimation, since the end of the 20th century this process involves direct simultaneous measurements (synchrophasor) using the phasor measurement units.

==Balanced systems==
The theory of three-phase power systems tells us that as long as the loads on each of the three phases are balanced, the system is fully represented by (and thus calculations can be performed for) any single phase (so called &quot;per phase analysis&quot;). In power engineering, this assumption is often useful, and to consider all three phases requires more effort with very little potential advantage. An important and frequent exception is an asymmetric fault on only one or two phases of the system. 

A one-line diagram is usually used along with other notational simplifications, such as the per-unit system.

A secondary advantage to using a one-line diagram is that the simpler diagram leaves more space for non-electrical, such as economic, information to be included.

==Unbalanced systems==
When using the method of symmetrical components, separate one-line diagrams are made for each of the positive, negative and zero-sequence systems. This simplifies the analysis of unbalanced conditions of a polyphase system. Items that have different impedances for the different phase sequences are identified on the diagrams. For example, in general a generator will have different positive and negative sequence impedance, and certain transformer winding connections block zero-sequence currents. The unbalanced system can be resolved into three single line diagrams for each sequence, and interconnected to show how the unbalanced components add in each part of the system.

<text>An apostolic nunciature is a top-level diplomatic mission of the Holy See that is equivalent to an embassy. However, it neither issues visas nor has consulates.

The head of the apostolic nunciature is called a &quot;nuncio&quot;, an ecclesiastical diplomatic title. A papal nuncio (officially known as an apostolic nuncio) is a permanent diplomatic representative (head of diplomatic mission) of the Holy See to a state or to one of two international intergovernmental organizations, the European Union or ASEAN, having the rank of an ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary, and the ecclesiastical rank of titular archbishop. Papal representatives to other intergovernmental organizations are known as &quot;permanent observers&quot; or &quot;delegates&quot;.

In several countries that have diplomatic relations with the Holy See, the apostolic nuncio is &quot;ipso facto&quot; the dean of the diplomatic corps. The nuncio is, in such a country, first in the order of precedence among all the diplomats accredited to the country, and he speaks for the diplomatic corps in matters of diplomatic privilege and protocol. Most countries that concede priority to the nuncio are officially Catholic, but some are not.

In addition, the nuncio serves as the liaison between the Holy See and the Church in that particular nation. The nuncio has an important role in the selection of bishops.

<text>Butterflies is a British sitcom written by Carla Lane that aired in the 9 pm timeslot on BBC2 from 10 November 1978 to 19 October 1983, with each series repeated on BBC1 a few months after the original transmissions.

The subject, the day-to-day life of the comfortable middle-class Parkinson family, is treated in a bittersweet style. There are traditional comedy themes (such as Ria&#x27;s terrible cooking, and various family squabbles) as well as other more serious themes such as Ria&#x27;s unconsummated relationship with the outwardly-successful Leonard. Ria is still in love with her husband, Ben, and has raised two teenage sons, yet finds herself unhappy and dissatisfied with her life and in need of something more. Throughout the series, Ria searches for that &quot;something more&quot;, and finds some solace in her unconventional friendship with Leonard. In a 2002 interview, Carla Lane explained, &quot;I wanted to write a comedy about a woman seriously contemplating adultery.&quot;

In the first episode, an expository discussion between Ria and Leonard alludes to the significance of the series&#x27; title: &quot;We are all kids chasing butterflies. You see it, you want it, you grab it, and there it is, all squashed in your hand.&quot; She adds, &quot;I am one of the few lucky ones, I have a pleasant house, a pleasant man and two pleasant sons. My butterfly didn&#x27;t get squashed.&quot; Ria&#x27;s husband Ben collects and studies butterflies.

==Cast and setting==

The show stars Wendy Craig as Ria Parkinson, a frustrated &#x27;stay-at-home&#x27; housewife, and Geoffrey Palmer as her reserved and hard-working dentist husband, Ben, who is also an amateur lepidopterist. Ria&#x27;s early dialogue in the first series suggests her age as early 40s, whereas her husband, Ben, describes himself as &quot;the wrong side of 45&quot;. Ben is a typically traditional, conservative white-collar professional, ill-at-ease with his sons&#x27; lack of work ethic and carefree, rebellious attitudes whilst remaining unaware of his wife&#x27;s impending midlife crisis. They have been married for 19 years and are depicted as having a comfortable lifestyle, supported by one breadwinner in the household at a time in British history when &#x27;stay-at-home&#x27; housewives were becoming less common. Ria&#x27;s disastrous attempts at cooking are a recurring gag.

The Parkinsons have two teenaged sons, both of driving age (at least 17 years of age under UK law in 1978) and unemployed (in 1978, youth unemployment was increasing). Their younger son Adam is played by Nicholas Lyndhurst, and their elder son Russell by Andrew Hall. Throughout all four series, there is a continuing subplot running in tandem with the main storyline, tracking the difficulties faced by young adolescent men coming of age in the UK at a time when there were relatively few employment opportunities. Both of the Parkinson sons are seen making fun of their father&#x27;s traditional post-war reserved British attitude, whilst also facing their own issues such as unemployment, girlfriend troubles, cannabis use against the wishes of their horrified father, and teenage pregnancy, when Russell fathers a child with his on-off girlfriend. Bruce Montague plays Ria&#x27;s friend Leonard, a successful businessman aged 44, whose wife has recently left him; he, like Ria, is approaching a midlife crisis. The show also featured two recurring minor characters: Leonard&#x27;s chauffeur and confidant Thomas (Michael Ripper) and the Parkinsons&#x27; cleaner, Ruby (Joyce Windsor), who often lends Ria an ear.

==Theme song and music==
The &quot;Butterflies&quot; theme song, &quot;Love Is Like a Butterfly&quot;, is a 1974 single written and originally recorded by American country music artist Dolly Parton. The cover version used at the opening of each episode was recorded for the series by Clare Torry, with a band conducted by BBC TV composer Ronnie Hazlehurst.

The Adagio in G minor attributed to Tomaso Albinoni was used as interlude music in most of the episodes where Ria is reflecting on her dilemma, and walking through a park on her own. It is a bittersweet twist on two partners, once very much in love, whose marriage is actually breaking down, but this is not recognised by the husband who is totally engrossed in his work and profession.

Ria starts a romance with another man, which is initially seen by the viewer as a virtual image (almost like a thought bubble in a cartoon) as she walks through the park. He later turns out to be real. The Adagio is used as a &quot;filler&quot; for the lack of script.

==Continuity==
The Parkinsons&#x27; address is confirmed as 11 Jade Road in the season 3 episode &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;. However, this had changed to 27 Jade Road by the season 4 episode &quot;Cleaning Windows&quot;.

==Filming locations==

&quot;Butterflies&quot; is set in the prosperous town of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. (Ben refers to this in the final episode, &quot;Loose Ends.&quot; Although the Parkinsons live in Jade Road, this is a fictitious address, actually filmed at 30 Bournside Road). Many of the exterior scenes were filmed in Cheltenham, including the High Street, Montpellier and Hatherley Park. Exterior shots for the Parkinson house were filmed at 30 Bournside Road in Up Hatherley, Cheltenham. Locations included properties along Bournside Road, Lansdown Road and Christchurch Road in Cheltenham, and that town&#x27;s Hatherley Park, Pittville Park, Imperial Gardens and Neptune&#x27;s Fountain; High Street; The Promenade, Montpellier; Peter&#x27;s Bar, 23 Montpellier Walk, which later became J.J. O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s; and Presto supermarket, Grosvenor Terrace, which later became Bannatyne&#x27;s Health and Fitness. The apparent office block that could often be seen behind the Parkinson&#x27;s house at 30 Bournside Road was, in fact, the rear of the catering block of the then North Gloucestershire College of Technology in The Park, Cheltenham, and is now a housing estate. Some external shots were filmed outside Cheltenham and surrounds; the railway station in &quot;An attractive visitor&quot; was Moreton-in-Marsh.

== Episodes ==
The series comprises twenty-eight episodes.

=== Series 1 (1978) ===

=== Series 2 (1979) ===


===Christmas sketch (1982)===
An eight-and-a-half-minute sketch aired as part of a Christmas special called &quot;The Funny Side of Christmas&quot; on BBC1 on 27 December 1982. The family are happy for a seasonal excuse to avoid eating Ria&#x27;s food. She reveals to Adam privately that Leonard has gone to New York, but he is instead outside in his car, until Thomas reminds him that his former wife is waiting for him at home. Leonard calls Ria on the home phone and Adam answers. Asking for Ria, Leonard is told that Ria is kissing Ben under the mistletoe. When Ria gets to the phone, Leonard hears her voice and hangs up without speaking.

===Special for Children in Need (2000)===
In November 2000, the cast (except for Michael Ripper who had recently died) reunited for a 13-minute episode in aid of Children in Need. The premise is Ria&#x27;s 60th birthday and the lack of change to her situation. Her son Adam is married and has a primary-school-aged daughter named Sophie. Russell however, has no interest in settling down.

===American series pilot (1979)===
An American remake was piloted but never commissioned. NBC broadcast the pilot in August 1979, with little change to the original scripting. It starred Jennifer Warren as Ria Parkinson and John McMartin as her husband, Ben Parkinson. Film actor Jim Hutton was featured as Leonard Dean in this version. It was Hutton&#x27;s final acting job. He died suddenly from liver cancer at the age of 45 in June 1979, several weeks before the pilot aired.

== DVD release ==
All episodes of &quot;Butterflies&quot; are available on DVD in the UK, distributed by Acorn Media UK. Only the first two series are available in the US.

== Accolades ==
The show received a BAFTA nomination for Best Television Comedy Series in 1981.

<text>The Nganasans ( ; Nganasan: &quot;ŋənəhsa(nəh)&quot;, &quot;ńæh&quot;) are a Uralic people of the Samoyedic branch native to the Taymyr Peninsula in north Siberia. In the Russian Federation, they are recognized as one of the indigenous peoples of the Russian North. They reside primarily in the settlements of Ust-Avam, Volochanka, and Novaya in the Taymyrsky Dolgano-Nenetsky District of Krasnoyarsk Krai, with smaller populations residing in the towns of Dudinka and Norilsk as well.

The Nganasans are thought to be the direct descendants of proto-Uralic peoples. However there is some evidence that they absorbed a local Paleo-Siberian population. The Nganasans were traditionally a semi-nomadic people whose main form of subsistence was wild reindeer hunting, in contrast to the Nenets, who herded reindeer. Beginning in the early 17th century, the Nganasans were subjected to the system of Czarist Russia. They lived relatively independently, until the 1970s, when they were settled in the villages they live in today, which are at the southern edges of the Nganasans&#x27; historical nomadic routes.

There is no certainty as to the exact number of Nganasans living in Russia today. The 2002 Russian census counted 862 Nganasans living in Russia, 766 of whom lived in the former Taymyr Autonomous Okrug. However, those who study the Nganasan estimate their population to comprise approximately 1,000 people. Historically, the Nganasan language and a Taymyr Pidgin Russian were the only languages spoken among the Nganasan, but with increased education and village settlement, Russian has become the first language of many Nganasans. Some Nganasans live in villages with a Dolgan majority, such as Ust-Avam. The Nganasan language is considered seriously endangered and it is estimated that at most 500 of the Nganasan can still speak it, with very limited proficiency among those 18 and younger.

==Etymology==

The Nganasans first referred to themselves in Russian as &quot;Samoyeds&quot;, but they would also often use this term when referring to the Enets people and instead refer to themselves as the Avam people. For the Nganasans, the term signified &quot;ngano-nganasana&quot;, which means &#x27;real people&#x27; in the Nganasan language, and referred to both themselves and the neighboring Madu Enets. However, in their own language, the Avam Nganasans refer to themselves as &quot;nya-tansa&quot;, which translates as &#x27;comrade tribe&#x27;, whereas the Vadeyev Nganasans to the east prefer to refer to themselves as &quot;a&#x27;sa&quot; which means &#x27;brother&#x27;, but also includes the Evenks and Dolgan. The Nganasans were also formerly called Tavgi Samoyeds or Tavgis initially by the Russians, which derives from the word &quot;tavgy&quot; in the Nenets language. Following the Russian Revolution, the Nganasans adopted their current appellation.

==Geography==

The Nganasans are the northernmost ethnic group of the Eurasian continent and the Russian Federation, historically inhabiting the tundra of the Taymyr Peninsula. The areas they inhabited stretched over an area of more than 100,000 square kilometers, from the Golchikha River in the west to the Khatanga Bay in the east, and from Lake Taymyr in the north to the Dudypta River in the south. The hunting areas of the Nganasan often coincided with those of the Dolgans and Enets to their east and west respectively. In the winter, they resided in the south of the peninsula at the edge of the Arctic tree line, and during the summer they followed wild reindeer up to 400 miles to the north, sometimes even reaching as far as the Byrranga Mountains.

==History==

===Origins===
The homeland of the Proto-Uralic peoples, including the Samoyeds, is suggested to be somewhere near the Ob and Yenisey river drainage areas of Central Siberia or near Lake Baikal.

The Nganasan are considered by most ethnographers who study them to have arisen as an ethnic group when Samoyedic peoples migrated to the Taymyr Peninsula from the south, encountering Paleo-Siberian peoples living there who they then assimilated into their culture. One group of Samoyedic people intermarried with Paleo-Siberian peoples living between the Taz and Yenisei rivers, forming a group that the Soviet ethnographer B. O. Dolgikh refers to as the Samoyed-Ravens. Another group intermarried with the Paleo-Siberian inhabitants of the Pyasina River and formed another group which he called the Samoyed-Eagles. Subsequently, a group of Tungusic people migrated to the region near Lake Pyasino and the Avam River, where they were absorbed into Samoyed culture, forming a new group called the Tidiris. There was another group of Tungusic peoples called the Tavgs who lived along the basins of the Khatanga and Anabar rivers and came into contact with the aforementioned Samoyedic peoples, absorbing their language and creating their own Tavg Samoyedic dialect. It is known that the ancestors of the Nganasan previously inhabited territory further south from a book in the city Mangazeya that lists yasak (fur tribute) payments by the Nganasan which were made in sable, an animal that does not inhabit the tundra where the Nganasan now live.

By the middle of the 17th century, Tungusic peoples began to push the Samoyedic peoples northward towards the tundra Taymyr Peninsula, where they merged into one tribe called Avam Nganasans. As the Tavgs were the largest Samoyedic group at the time of this merger, their dialect formed the basis of the present-day Nganasan language. In the late 19th century, a Tungusic group called the Vanyadyrs also moved to the Eastern Taymyr peninsula, where they were absorbed by the Avam Nganasans, resulting in the tribe that is now called Vadeyev Nganasans. In the 19th century, a member of the Dolgans, a Turkic people who lived east of the Nganasans, was also absorbed by the Nganasans, and his descendants formed an eponymous clan, which today, though linguistically fully Samoyedic, is still acknowledged as being Dolgan in origin.

===Contact with Russians===
The Nganasans first came into contact with Russians sometime in the early 17th century, and after some resistance, began to pay tribute to the Czar in the form of sable fur under the yasak system in 1618. Tribute collectors established themselves at the &quot;Avam Winter Quarters&quot;, at the confluence of the Avam and Dudypta rivers, which is the site of the modern-day settlement Ust-Avam. The Nganasans often tried to avoid paying yasak by changing the names that they provided to the Russians. Relations between the Russians and Nganasans were not always peaceful. In 1666, the Nganasans ambushed and killed yasak collectors, soldiers, tradesmen, and their interpreters on three occasions, stealing the sable furs and property belonging to them. Over the course of the year, 35 men were killed in total.

The Nganasan had little direct contact with merchants and, unlike most indigenous Siberians, they were never baptized or otherwise contacted by missionaries. Some Nganasans traded directly with the Russians, while others did so via the Dolgans. They usually exchanged sable furs for alcohol, tobacco, tea, and various tools, products which quickly integrated themselves into Nganasan culture. In the 1830s, and again from 1907 to 1908, Russian contact caused major smallpox outbreaks among the Ngansans.

===Soviet Union===

The Nganasans first came into contact with the Soviets around in the 1930s, when the government instituted a program of collectivization. The Soviets had established that 11% of families owned 60 percent of the deer, while the lower 66% owned only 17 percent, and redistributed this property by collectivizing reindeer into around which the Nganasan then settled. This represented a great change in lifestyle, as the Nganasan, who had primarily been reindeer hunters, were forced to expand their small stock of domesticated reindeer that had previously only been primarily for transport or eaten during periods of famine. Additionally, the Soviets took a greater interest in the Nganasans as a people, and starting in the 1930s, ethnographers began to study their customs.

Despite collectivization and the institution of the , the Nganasans were able to maintain a semi-nomadic lifestyle following domesticated reindeer herds up until the early 1970s, when the state settled the Nganasans along with the Dolgans and Enets in three different villages it constructed: Ust-Avam, Volochanka, and Novaya. Nganasan were combined to create the villages, and after settling in them, the Nganasans shifted from employment to working for , the government hunting enterprise, which supplied meat to the burgeoning industrial center Norilsk to the southwest. By 1978, all domestic reindeer herding had ceased, and with new Soviet equipment, the yield of hunted wild reindeer reached 50,000 in the 1980s. Most Nganasan men were employed as hunters, and the women worked as teachers or as seamstresses decorating reindeer boots. Nganasan children began schooling in Russian, and even pursuing secondary education. The Soviet planned economy provided the Nganasan settlements with wages, machinery, consumer goods, and education, allowing the Nganasans to achieve a relatively high standard of living by the end of the 1980s.

==Religion==
The traditional religion of the Nganasans is animistic and shamanistic. Their religion is a particularly well-preserved example of Siberian shamanism, which remained relatively free of foreign influence due to the Nganasans&#x27; geographic isolation until recent history. Because of their isolation, shamanism was a living phenomenon in the lives of the Nganasans, even into the beginning of the 20th century. The last notable Nganasan shaman&#x27;s seances were recorded on film by anthropologists in the 1970s.
==Language==
The Nganasan language (formerly called , , or , in Russian; from the ethnonym , ) is a moribund Samoyedic language spoken by the Nganasan people. It is now considered highly endangered, as most Nganasan people now speak Russian rather than their native language. In 2010, it was estimated that only 125 Nganasan people can speak it in the southwestern and central parts of the Taymyr Peninsula.

== Genetics ==

The characteristic genetic marker of the Nganasans and most other Uralic-speakers is Y-DNA haplogroup N1c-Tat. Other Samoyedic peoples mainly have more N1b-P43, rather than N1c, suggesting a bottleneck event. Haplogroup N originated in the northern part of China in 20,000–25,000 years BP and spread to Northern Eurasia, through Siberia to Northern Europe. Subgroup N1c1 is frequently seen in non-Samoyedic peoples, N1c2 in Samoyedic peoples. In addition, mtDNA haplogroup Z, found with low frequency in Saami, Finns, and Siberians, is related to the migration of people speaking Uralic languages.

Nganasans are linked to &quot;Neo-Siberian&quot; ancestry, which is estimated to have expanded from the northeast Asian region into Siberia about ~11,000 years ago BCE.

In 2019, a study based on genetics, archaeology and linguistics found that Uralic speakers arrived in the Baltic region from the East, specifically from Siberia, at the beginning of the Iron Age some 2,500 years ago, together with a Nganasan-related component, possibly linked to the spread of Uralic languages.

In another genetic study in 2019, published in &quot;Nature Communications&quot;, it was found that the Nganasans best represent a possible source population for the Proto-Uralic people. Nganasan-like ancestry is found in every group of modern Uralic-speakers in varying degrees.
