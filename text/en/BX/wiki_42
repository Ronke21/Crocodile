<text>The Fresno Grizzlies are a Minor League Baseball team of the California League and the Single-A affiliate of the Colorado Rockies. They are located in Fresno, California, and play their home games at Chukchansi Park, which was opened in 2002 in downtown Fresno. They previously played at Fresno State&#x27;s Pete Beiden Field from 1998 to 2001.

The Grizzlies were established in 1998 as members of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League (PCL). They won the PCL championship in 2015, making it the only league title in franchise history. Fresno was transferred to the Low-A West in 2021, but this was renamed the California League in 2022.

==History==
===Prior professional baseball in Fresno===
Professional baseball first came to Fresno in 1898 when it had a team in the original California League. The team dropped out of the league after that year but returned in 1905. In 1906, the Tacoma Tigers of the Pacific Coast League moved to Fresno, playing as the Fresno Raisin Eaters for one season before moving to Sacramento for the 1907 season. In the intervening years before the arrival of the Grizzlies, Fresno fielded teams in the California State League in 1910 and 1913, and in the current California League from 1941 through 1988, including the Fresno Cardinals (1941–1956), Fresno Sun Sox (1957), Fresno Giants (1958–1987), and Fresno Suns (1988).

===San Francisco Giants (1998–2014)===
When Major League Baseball awarded an expansion team (the Arizona Diamondbacks) to Phoenix, Arizona, that would begin playing in 1998, the Phoenix Firebirds of the Pacific Coast League (the San Francisco Giants&#x27; Triple-A affiliate) were forced to move. The Firebirds moved to Tucson, Arizona and changed their name to the Tucson Sidewinders while changing their affiliation to the Diamondbacks. That prompted the Tucson Toros to move to Fresno, giving Fresno its first PCL team since 1906. The Toros were renamed the Grizzlies and became the Giants&#x27; new Triple-A affiliate.

From 1998 through 2001, the Grizzlies played at Pete Beiden Field at California State University, Fresno, before moving to Chukchansi Park.

During the team&#x27;s 11-year history in Fresno, it has had several different owners. In October 2005, the team was sold again, this time to Fresno Baseball Club LLC, headquartered in Delaware.

The team hosted such promotions as K-Fed Night and Second Chance Night in 2006; &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; Night in 2007; and Totally Rad 80s Night featuring &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; star Billy Zabka in May 2008.

Parker, the Grizzlies mascot, was named Best Mascot of 2007 by GameOps, beating out all other major and minor league mascots. The Grizzlies former mascot, Wild Thing, &quot;retired&quot; in 2006 after eight years as the team&#x27;s mascot. Chukchansi Park is also home to the Drag Kings, the Grizzlies&#x27; dancing grounds crew who were given an honorable mention by GameOps as Best Entertainment act. The Grizzlies won the Minor League Baseball Promotion of the Year award in 2008 for their &quot;Mascot Showdown&quot; featuring Parker and the Phillie Phanatic. The team&#x27;s opening day catcher in 2010, Buster Posey, would be the San Francisco Giants&#x27; starting catcher for the World Series six months later (the Giants&#x27; starting catcher for most of their World Championship season, Bengie Molina, would start for their opponents, the Texas Rangers), resulting in his National League Rookie of the Year award that year.

===Houston Astros (2015–2018)===
In 2015, Fresno became an affiliate of the Houston Astros.
That season, they won the Triple-A Baseball National Championship Game by defeating the Columbus Clippers, 7–0, in El Paso, Texas.

Following the 2017 season, Grizzlies manager Tony DeFrancesco announced he would not return to the Houston Astros organization for the 2018 season. DeFrancesco led Fresno to a winning record in each of his three seasons at the helm, his clubs compiling a record of 234–194 (.547) from 2015 to 2017. The run marked the first time in franchise history (since 1998) the Grizzlies completed three consecutive winning seasons.

On January 19, 2018, Rodney Linares was named the 10th manager in Grizzlies history. The team was sold to Fresno Sports and Events, a group led by Ray and Michael Baker, part owners of the Colorado Rockies and Grand Junction Rockies, and Jim Coufos, a prior investor in the High Desert Mavericks, in a transaction that was made official on February 27, 2018.

The Astros declined to renew their player-development contract with Fresno beyond the 2018 season.

===Washington Nationals (2019–2020)===

The team unveiled new logos, colors, and uniforms for the 2019 season. While retaining the Grizzlies name and grizzly bear imagery, the team switched to a red, black, beige, and brown color scheme with logos and uniforms that resemble the flag of California.

Fresno also gained a new major league affiliate for 2019. The Grizzlies and Washington Nationals agreed to a player development contract for the 2019 and 2020 seasons. The start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before being cancelled on June 30. In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s reorganization of the minors after the 2020 season, the Washington Nationals opted to discontinue their affiliation with the Grizzlies, leaving them in need of a new affiliate.

===Colorado Rockies (2021–present)===
In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Grizzlies were transferred to the Low-A West as the Low-A classification affiliate of the Colorado Rockies. They won the 2021 Northern Division title with a 74–41 record. In the best-of-five league championship series, Fresno was defeated by the San Jose Giants, 3–0. Zac Veen was selected as the league&#x27;s Top MLB Prospect, and Robinson Cancel won its Manager of the Year Award. In 2022, the Low-A West became known as the California League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization, and was reclassified as a Single-A circuit.

==Season-by-season records==


==Popular culture==
The 2012 family film &quot;Parental Guidance&quot; features Billy Crystal as the radio voice of the Fresno Grizzlies. The Grizzlies gained national attention in summer 2015 for playing a game as The Fresno Tacos, which was done to celebrate the city of Fresno&#x27;s annual &quot;Taco Truck Throwdown&quot; and came complete with a specially designed tacos uniform.

The main character of the 2023 sitcom &quot;Not Dead Yet&quot;, Nell Serrano, is a fan of the Fresno Grizzlies. The seventh episode of season one, Not Out of the Game Yet, involves her writing the obituary for the Grizzlies former color commentator.

==Radio==
All games are broadcast on the Fresno Grizzlies website, with Stephen Rice handling the play-by-play.

<text>Hochelaga (; formerly known as Sainte-Marie and Montreal—Sainte-Marie) is a federal electoral district in Quebec, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1867 to 1988 and since 2004.

==Geography==
The district includes the neighbourhood of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and the western part of the neighbourhood of Longue-Pointe in the Borough of Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, the eastern part of the neighbourhood of Rosemont in the Borough of Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie and the eastern part of the neighbourhood of Centre-Sud in the Borough of Ville-Marie.

===Political geography===
Until 2011, this working class riding strongly favoured the Bloc, which in 2008, won most polls.

The New Democrats placed second in the 2009 by-election; as in much of Quebec, Bloc support collapsed in the 2011 election and the New Democrats swept the riding.

==Demographics==
:&quot;According to the 2006 Canadian census&quot;

* Ethnic groups: 83.5% White, 4.5% Black, 2.8% Latin American, 2.5% Arab, 2.2% Chinese, 1.9% Southeast Asian, 1.0% South Asian
* Religions: (2001) 80.9% Catholic, 3.1% Protestant, 2.2% Muslim, 1.4% Buddhist, 1.4% Christian Orthodox, 9.4% No religion
* Average income: $20,781

:&quot;According to the 2016 Canadian census&quot;
* Twenty most common mother tongue languages (2016) : 75.8% French, 4.1% Spanish, 3.7% Arabic, 3.6% English, 1.5% Portuguese, 1.4% Italian, 1.1% Creole languages, 1.1% Vietnamese, 0.9% Kabyle, 0.8% Mandarin, 0.6% Cantonese, 0.5% Russian, 0.5% Romanian, 0.4% Polish, 0.3% Bengali, 0.3% Ukrainian, 0.3% Greek, 0.2% Khmer, 0.2% Farsi, 0.2% Tamil, 0.2% Lingala

==History==
The electoral district of Hochelaga was created in 1867 covering the entire eastern part of the Island of Montreal. In 1976, it was renamed &quot;Sainte-Marie&quot;. In 1981, it was renamed &quot;Montreal—Sainte-Marie&quot;.

The riding was abolished in 1987 when it was redistributed into Laurier—Sainte-Marie and Rosemont ridings.

&quot;Hochelaga&quot; riding was recreated in 2003 from parts of Hochelaga—Maisonneuve and Laurier—Sainte-Marie ridings.

This riding lost territory to Laurier—Sainte-Marie and Saint-Léonard—Saint-Michel, and gained territory from La Pointe-de-l&#x27;Île and Honoré-Mercier during the 2012 electoral redistribution.

Following the 2022 federal electoral redistribution the riding will be renamed Hochelaga—Rosemont-Est. The boundary with Saint-Léonard—Saint-Michel along Rue Bélanger will move to the borough boundary between Rosemont—La-Petite-Patrie and Saint-Léonard.

===Members of Parliament===
This riding has elected the following members of Parliament:

<text>The New Orleans Baby Cakes (formerly the New Orleans Zephyrs) were a Minor League Baseball team in the Pacific Coast League (PCL) and the Triple-A affiliate of the Miami Marlins. They were located in Metairie, Louisiana, a suburb of New Orleans, and played their home games at the Shrine on Airline.

The team began play in 1993 as a member of the Triple-A American Association (AA) when the Denver Zephyrs relocated to New Orleans. They joined the PCL in 1998. New Orleans has qualified for the postseason on three occasions and has won the PCL championship twice as the Triple-A affiliate of the Houston Astros (1998 and 2001).

At the end of the 2019 season, the team relocated to Wichita, Kansas, where they continue as the Wichita Wind Surge. Initially, the city of New Orleans hoped to bring a Double-A Southern League team to the city and continue operations as the Baby Cakes. However, due to Major League Baseball&#x27;s reorganization of Minor League Baseball, the campaign ultimately failed.

==History==
Professional baseball was first played in New Orleans in the late 19th century. The city&#x27;s longest-running team was the New Orleans Pelicans who played off and on from 1887 to 1977 primarily in the Southern Association. The Pelicans left after the 1977 season, and the city went without a pro team until 1993. The New Orleans Zephyrs came to New Orleans by way of Denver, Colorado, in 1993. With the arrival of the Colorado Rockies Major League Baseball expansion team, the city&#x27;s Denver Zephyrs were forced to relocate.

Louisiana lawyer and business promoter Robert E. Couhig, Jr. led the effort to relocate the team to New Orleans. The &quot;Zephyr&quot; name was appropriate for New Orleans, too, as the Zephyr Roller Coaster was a popular ride at the Pontchartrain Beach amusement park (which had closed in 1983). The New Orleans Zephyrs remained in the American Association through 1997. The circuit disbanded following the season, and they joined the Pacific Coast League in 1998.

The Zephyrs won the 1998 PCL championship and went on to win the Triple-A World Series against the Buffalo Bisons, 3–1. The Zephyrs were also slated to participate in the 2001 championship series with the Tacoma Rainiers, but the playoffs were cancelled in the wake of the September 11 attacks, and the teams were named co-champions.

The Zephyrs finished out the last portion of their home games for the 2005 Pacific Coast League season three days before Hurricane Katrina hit the City of New Orleans, and though Zephyr Field sustained moderate damage, the team was able to open the 2006 season at home, making them the first professional team in New Orleans to do so after the hurricane.

On May 5–6, 2006, the Zephyrs and Nashville Sounds participated in a 24-inning game at Nashville, Tennessee&#x27;s Herschel Greer Stadium which was played over the course of two days and lasted a total of eight hours and seven minutes. The game matched the longest game, in terms of innings played, in PCL history. The Zephyrs scored once in the eighth inning and once in the ninth, and the teams remained tied through 18 innings before curfew was called. New Orleans won, 5–4, on the second day on a Wiki González RBI single. The Zephyrs set 12 franchise records, including striking out a league-record 29 times.

In 2008, the Zephyrs&#x27; season ended three days early due to the approach of Hurricane Gustav. When it became apparent that Gustav would hit the Gulf Coast on September 1, they cancelled their games of August 30 through September 1.

On September 22, 2008, the Zephyrs became the Triple-A affiliate of the Florida Marlins (now the Miami Marlins). In October 2009, the team unveiled a new logo with the letter Z set against a fleur-de-lis.

Longtime New Orleans sports public address announcer Doug Moreau joined the game day staff in 2003 as the organization&#x27;s fifth stadium announcer and remained behind the microphone for 13 seasons, giving him the longest stretch in the organization&#x27;s time in New Orleans. J.L. Vangilder was the official scorer from the beginning of the team&#x27;s time in New Orleans until June 2014. At that point, Moreau took on the dual role as official scorer and announcer for the remainder of the 2014 season and much of the 2015 season.

The Zephyrs rebranded for the 2017 season. A name-the-team contest was held in search of a new team name to be accompanied by a new color scheme and logos by Brandiose. The seven finalist monikers were Baby Cakes, Crawfish, King Cakes, Night Owls, Po&#x27;boys, Red Eyes, and Tailgators. On November 15, the team unveiled Baby Cakes as the new team name and purple, green, and gold as the new team colors, as well as a unique promotion to promote the name: any child born in the state of Louisiana during 2017 was eligible for a lifetime pass to Baby Cakes games, and would be entered into a raffle wherein the winner would receive a full four-year tuition to a state college in Louisiana upon their 18th birthday in 2035. As part of the rebrand, the team&#x27;s stadium, Zephyr Field, was changed to Shrine on Airline.

The name change was met with mixed reactions. Some fans found the new moniker and logos appealing, and the team reported increased merchandise sales after the announcement. Others expressed disappointment in the new name via social media, claiming it to be an unsuitable name for a sports team and that it did not accurately reflect local culture. At the time of the branding announcement, the team noted fan interest in retaining the Zephyrs moniker, but pointed out that the name had relocated from Denver to New Orleans and had no regional ties or significance other than the roller coaster at Pontchartrain Beach which closed in 1983.

On April 14, 2017, Baby Cakes pitchers Scott Copeland (7 IP), Hunter Cervenka (1 IP), and Brandon Cunniff (1 IP) combined to pitch a no-hitter against the Iowa Cubs.

On September 2, 2019, the PCL Triple-A New Orleans Baby Cakes played their final game ever as the &quot;Baby Cakes&quot; on the road against the Oklahoma City Dodgers in Oklahoma City with a 10-1 win over the Dodgers to cap off 27 years of Triple-A baseball in the Big Easy since the team relocated there in 1993. 

The team relocated to Wichita, Kansas, in 2020 and re-branded as the Wichita Wind Surge. After the 2021 MiLB reorganization, the team was not invited back as a Triple-A affiliate and was instead invited to serve as a Double-A team.

<doc id="671224" wikidata="Q3536046" url="?curid=671224" title="Crow kinship">
<text>Crow kinship is a kinship system used to define family. Identified by Lewis Henry Morgan in his 1871 work &quot;Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of the Human Family&quot;, the Crow system is one of the six major kinship systems (Eskimo, Hawaiian, Iroquois, Crow, Omaha, and Sudanese).

==Kinship system==
The system is somewhat similar to the Iroquois system, but distinguishes between the mother&#x27;s side and the father&#x27;s side. Relatives on the mother&#x27;s side of the family have more descriptive terms, and relatives on the father&#x27;s side have more classificatory terms.

The Crow system is distinctive because unlike most other kinship systems, it chooses not to distinguish between certain generations. The relatives of the subject&#x27;s father&#x27;s matrilineage are distinguished only by their sex, regardless of their age or generation. In contrast, within Ego&#x27;s own matrilineage, differences of generation are noted. The system is associated with groups that have a strong tradition of matrilineal descent. In doing so, the system is almost a mirror image of the Omaha system, which is patrilineal.

As with the Iroquois system, the Crow uses bifurcate merging, meaning that there is a distinction between collateral relatives of different gender in Ego&#x27;s descent group. In this case, father&#x27;s brother would be called &quot;father&#x27;s brother&quot;, and mother&#x27;s brother would be called &quot;uncle&quot;. Only the Iroquois system uses bifurcate merging as a secondary name.
==Usage==
The system is named for the Crow Tribe of Montana. The system appears frequently among various cultures. In the Southwestern US, it has traditionally been part of the Hopi Indian culture and the Navajo Nation.

<doc id="671225" wikidata="Q2297548" url="?curid=671225" title="Oklahoma City Comets">
<text>The Oklahoma City Comets are a Minor League Baseball team of the Pacific Coast League (PCL) and the Triple-A affiliate of the Los Angeles Dodgers. They are located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and play their home games at Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark, which opened in 1998 in the city&#x27;s Bricktown district.

The team was originally known as the Oklahoma City 89ers from 1962 to 1997 and played at All Sports Stadium. The 89ers competed in the Triple-A American Association (AA) in 1962, moved to the Pacific Coast League from 1963 to 1968, and returned to the AA from 1969 to 1997. After the American Association disbanded, the 89ers rejoined the PCL in 1998 and have been members of it since, including the 2021 season when it was known as the Triple-A West. The team renamed itself the Oklahoma RedHawks from 1998 to 2008 and the Oklahoma City RedHawks from 2009 to 2014. The franchise affiliated with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2015 and changed its name to the Oklahoma City Dodgers. The team was temporarily called the Oklahoma City Baseball Club for the 2024 season before becoming the Comets in 2025.

Oklahoma City has won five league championships. The 89ers won the PCL championship in 1963 and 1965 as the Triple-A affiliate of the Houston Colt .45s/Astros. They later won the American Association championship in 1992 and 1996 with the Texas Rangers. Oklahoma City won their third PCL championship in 2023 as affiliates of the Los Angeles Dodgers.

==History==
===Oklahoma City Mets and Indians (1904–1957)===
Oklahoma City has been home to professional baseball for all but a few years since 1904, when the Metropolitans (Mets) were established as the city&#x27;s first team. Oklahoma City&#x27;s teams and names have changed numerous times since. The team became known as the Indians in 1909 before returning to the original Mets name in 1910 and reverting again to the Indians name in 1911. Oklahoma City was home to the Senators in 1912. After one year without a baseball team, Oklahoma City&#x27;s squad became the Boosters in 1914. The Senators name returned from 1915 to 1916, but the Boosters name came back in 1917. The Oklahoma City Indians name returned in 1918 and the team name stuck until 1957 (the team did not compete during World War II).

===Oklahoma City 89ers (1962–1997)===
Oklahoma City&#x27;s current baseball franchise began competing in 1962 as the Oklahoma City 89ers following a four-year period without professional baseball in the area. The franchise&#x27;s original name made reference to the Land Run of 1889, which led to the founding of Oklahoma City. 
After the Houston Buffaloes of the American Association were purchased for territorial rights by the Houston Colt .45s (later the Houston Astros) of the National League, the big league club decided to move the Buffs elsewhere. In July 1961, Spec Richardson, who was then general manager of the Buffs, met with Oklahoma City officials and boosters, and agreed to move the team. After a unanimous approval from the American Association&#x27;s board of directors, the current franchise began play in 1962 as the top affiliate of the Houston Colt .45s. The 89ers won the PCL championship in 1963 and 1965. 

The Astros divested the team to Tulsa businessman, P. C. Dixon, in November 1970. The franchise affiliated with Cleveland from 1973 and 1975 and with the Philadelphia Phillies from 1976 until 1982. 

The Texas Rangers became the parent club in 1983. The 89ers won the American Association championship in 1992 and 1996 as an affiliate of the Rangers.

===Oklahoma City RedHawks (1998–2014)===
 The franchise moved to the new Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark in 1998, returned to the PCL, and renamed the team the Oklahoma RedHawks. The team was renamed the RedHawks after the red-tailed hawk, a bird of prey commonly seen throughout Oklahoma. When announcing the new name, team officials noted the raptor&#x27;s four-foot wingspan and migration patterns, which always return the bird to Oklahoma. A hawk is also part of the state&#x27;s official song.

 Prior to the 2009 season, the team once again named itself after its home city. The minor renaming was accompanied by new logos and a new color scheme. The team&#x27;s name change to the Oklahoma City RedHawks was made to honor Oklahoma City citizens who paid for the ballpark through a temporary one-cent sales tax to fund the Metropolitan Area Projects Plan or MAPS.

 Pitchers Dustin Nippert and Luis Mendoza recorded the two no-hitters in team history (since 1998). Nippert recorded the RedHawks&#x27; first no-hitter on June 29, 2008, at Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha, Nebraska against the Omaha Royals. The Redhawks won the seven-inning game, the first of a doubleheader, 2–0. Nippert walked two batters and struck out five in the first Oklahoma City professional baseball no-hitter since August 13, 1996, when Rick Helling recorded a perfect game for the 89ers).

Mendoza pitched the team&#x27;s first nine-inning no-hitter on August 14, 2009, against the Salt Lake Bees at Bricktown Ballpark. He threw 125 pitches, including 74 for strikes. He walked six and struck out six batters in the 5–0 win.

Six players have hit three home runs in a single game. Adrián González became the first to accomplish the offensive feat on May 24, 2005, at Albuquerque. He went 3-for-4 with five RBI. All three of Nelson Cruz&#x27;s hits on July 19, 2008, against Memphis were home runs. He went 3-for-5 with five RBI in the game. Nate Gold went 4-for-5 with three homers and four RBI on July 28, 2008, at Colorado Springs. Chad Tracy hit three homers on June 27, 2010, against Omaha, finishing the game 3-for-3 with five RBI. Mike Hessman went 4-for-4 with three homers on June 3, 2012, against Iowa. Matt Duffy went 3-for-4 with three homers and three RBI on June 9, 2014, against Salt Lake.

Gregorio Petit is the lone OKC player to record two grand slams in one game, accomplishing the feat June 22, 2010 at New Orleans.

On September 14, 2010, the Texas Rangers ownership announced that they were moving their Triple-A affiliation to the Round Rock Express (formerly the Astros&#x27; Triple-A affiliate). On September 15, the RedHawks were sold to Mandalay Baseball Properties, which also owns or operates four other Minor League Baseball teams, and is part of the Mandalay Entertainment conglomerate chaired by entertainment industry executive Peter Guber. On September 20, Mandalay entered into a formal agreement for the RedHawks to become the Astros&#x27; new Triple-A affiliate.

Anderson Hernandez put together the longest hitting streak in team history August 2 – September 2, 2011 – a streak that lasted 30 games.

The 2013 Redhawks made numerous entries into the club&#x27;s record book. The RedHawks set the team record for most runs scored in a game at Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark and tied the club record for most runs scored in a game overall in a 24–5 win against Colorado Springs on August 3, 2013.

The 2013 squad also compiled the longest overall and home winning streaks in club history. The RedHawks won 12 straight games overall from July 26 to August 6. They continued winning at home, stringing together 17 consecutive wins at Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark from July 26 to August 20.

===Oklahoma City Dodgers (2015–2023)===

After the 2014 season, the RedHawks announced the sale of the franchise to a partnership between Mandalay Entertainment Chairman and CEO Peter Guber, other current principals of Mandalay Baseball Properties, Jason Sugarman, and the Los Angeles Dodgers. As a result of the purchase agreement, the RedHawks became the Triple-A affiliate of the Dodgers in 2015 and were renamed after their parent club, becoming the Oklahoma City Dodgers. 

The 2015 OKC Dodgers set a new modern-era mark for wins, finishing the regular season with the best record in the PCL at 86-58 and going on to win the American Northern Division title. The last OKC team to win at least 86 games was the 1965 Oklahoma City 89ers (91-54). The 2015 team also set single-season team records for road wins (44), fewest runs allowed (608), and fewest home runs allowed (89). The team stood 30 games above .500 (85-55) during the season, the first time the team reached that mark in its modern PCL history. OKC Dodgers manager Damon Berryhill was named 2015 PCL Manager of the Year, becoming the first OKC manager to win the honor since Greg Biagini in 1999.

Corey Seager became the second OKC player in the PCL era to record six hits in a game when he went 6-for-6 in Salt Lake May 28, 2015, including a home run and two doubles. Seager collected six RBI and scored two runs. Jeff Pickler was the first OKC player in the modern era to accomplish the feat June 22, 2004, at Albuquerque, going 6-for-6 with a double, triple, and RBI.

The 2016 OKC Dodgers claimed a second straight 80-win regular season and picked up back-to-back PCL American Northern Division championships. They advanced to the PCL Championship Series for the first time since 2008.

The 2016 Dodgers posted a 3.72 team ERA to establish a new club record during the PCL era and the OKC pitching staff racked up a league-leading 1,245 strikeouts to set the PCL modern era record for strikeouts in just 141 games. The Dodgers allowed a league-low 372 walks, also the fewest allowed by an OKC team during the PCL era. Pitcher Jose De Leon became the first OKC pitcher to record five double-digit strikeout games in one season.

The record-breaking continued for the OKC Dodgers in 2017. The team broke its own record for strikeouts as Dodgers pitchers combined for 1,277 strikeouts during the season.

Right-handed starting pitcher Wilmer Font led the charge and paced all of Triple-A baseball with 178 strikeouts and set OKC&#x27;s all-time single-season strikeout record (since 1998). He tied former Dodger Jose De Leon&#x27;s club record by compiling five games with at least 10 strikeouts. Font racked up a team-record 15 strikeouts on May 15 against Sacramento at Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark and went on to be named the PCL Pitcher of the Year.

The Dodgers recorded back-to-back-to-back home runs for the first time in modern team history (since 1998) June 9, 2017, against Round Rock in Oklahoma City. With one out in the first inning, Joc Pederson, Scott Van Slyke, and Willie Calhoun each homered within a span of five pitches.

The third-largest crowd in Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark history was on hand to watch a rehab appearance by Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw August 26, 2017, against the Omaha Storm Chasers. A standing-room-only crowd of 13,106 was the largest in OKC since April 18, 1998 – the third game ever played at Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark.

The start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being canceled on June 30. In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Dodgers were organized into the Triple-A West. Oklahoma City ended the season tied for second place in the Eastern Division with a 61–58 record. No playoffs were held to determine a league champion; instead, the team with the best regular-season record was declared the winner. However, 10 games that had been postponed from the start of the season were reinserted into the schedule as a postseason tournament called the Triple-A Final Stretch in which all 30 Triple-A clubs competed for the highest winning percentage. Oklahoma City finished the tournament tied for seventh place with a 6–4 record.

Following the 2021 season, on December 14, 2021, the Oklahoma City Dodgers were purchased by Diamond Baseball Holdings, a subsidiary of Endeavor Group Holdings, Inc. With the Los Angeles Dodgers remaining a parent club affiliate. In 2022, the Triple-A West became known as the Pacific Coast League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

Playing under a split-season format in 2023 in which the teams with the best league-wide records at the end of each half qualified for the playoffs, Oklahoma City won the first-half title at 50–23. They tied for fifth place in the second-half with a record of 40–35. Overall, the team posted the league&#x27;s best record, 90–58. In a single round of playoffs versus the Round Rock Express, winners of the second-half, the Dodgers won their third PCL championship, two games to none. They lost the Triple-A National Championship Game versus the Norfolk Tides, champions of the International League, 7–6.

===Oklahoma City Baseball Club (2024)===

After the 2023 season, the team name was changed to the Oklahoma City Baseball Club while options were explored for a new, unique, and locally-oriented name that would differentiate the Oklahoma City club from its parent organization. The club operated under this temporary name until a new identity was announced following the 2024 season.

===Oklahoma City Comets (2025–present)===
After the 2024 season, the team changed its name to the Oklahoma City Comets, an homage to Mickey Mantle&#x27;s nickname, &quot;the Commerce Comet&quot;, and to honor the city&#x27;s ties to the aerospace industry.

<text>Ferrex was the son of the legendary king Gorboduc of the Britons, and fought with his brother Porrex for the throne, according to Geoffrey of Monmouth.

When his father had become old, he quarrelled with his brother Porrex over who would succeed to the kingship. Ferrex discovered that Porrex planned to kill him, and fled to Gaul, where he enlisted the help of Suhard, the king of the Franks. Upon his return, he fought a battle with his brother and died there. The Gaulish army was also destroyed.

Ferrex had been his mother Judon&#x27;s favourite son, and she avenged his death by killing Porrex in his sleep. This led to a long civil war between five kings in Britain.

==Later tradition==
Ferrex was a central character in Thomas Norton and Thomas Sackville&#x27;s play &quot;Gorboduc&quot; (1561).

<doc id="671227" wikidata="Q2118310" url="?curid=671227" title="Omaha Storm Chasers">
<text>The Omaha Storm Chasers are a Minor League Baseball team of the International League and the Triple-A affiliate of the Kansas City Royals. They are located in Papillion, Nebraska, a suburb southwest of Omaha, and play their home games at Werner Park, which opened in 2011. The team previously played at Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium from 1969 to 2010.

Omaha has been the only Triple-A affiliate of the Kansas City Royals since their inception in the 1969 Major League Baseball expansion. They were originally known as the Omaha Royals when established as a member of the Triple-A American Association in 1969. They joined the Pacific Coast League (PCL) in 1998 and were briefly known as the Omaha Golden Spikes (1999–2001) before reverting to their Royals moniker. Omaha became the Storm Chasers in 2011. In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the team was placed in the Triple-A East, which rebranded as the International League in 2022.

Omaha has won eight league championships. Most recently, they won the International League championship in 2024. They previously won the PCL championship in 2011 and back-to-back in 2013 and 2014. They also won the American Association championship in 1969, 1970, 1978, and 1990. Omaha went on to win the Triple-A Classic in 1990 and the Triple-A National Championship Game in 2013 and 2014.

==History==

=== Prior professional baseball in Omaha ===

Omaha has been home to Minor League Baseball teams since the late 19th century. The city&#x27;s professional baseball history dates back to 1879 with the formation of the Omaha Green Stockings, who were charter members of the Northwestern League. They were followed by other teams, such as the Omahogs, Lambs, Indians, Rangers, Rourkes, Buffaloes, Crickets, and Packers, that competed in either the Western League or Western Association through 1936. The Omaha Cardinals were the city&#x27;s team from 1947 to 1959 as members of the Class A Western League before joining the Triple-A American Association in 1955. After having no team in 1960, the Omaha Dodgers represented the city in the American Association from 1961 to 1962. The league disbanded after the 1962 season, leaving Omaha without professional baseball for the next six years.

=== American Association (1969–1997) ===

The Omaha Royals were established in 1969 as members of the American Association (AA) to serve as the Triple-A affiliate of the Kansas City Royals, who were a product of the 1969 Major League Baseball expansion. Omaha&#x27;s team was named for and owned by their Major League Baseball (MLB) affiliate. Their home ballpark was Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium, which was built in 1948.

Managed by Jack McKeon in their inaugural 1969 season, the Royals won the American Association championship with an 85–55 record, six games ahead of the second-place Tulsa Oilers. McKeon was selected for the AA Manager of the Year Award. In 1970, he led the Royals to win the Eastern Division title with a 73–65 record. In the best-of-seven postseason playoffs, Omaha defeated the Denver Bears, 4–1, to win their second league championship. They then advanced to the Junior World Series to face the Syracuse Chiefs, champions of the Triple-A International League, but they lost the series, 4–1. McKeon won a second Manager of the Year Award, and outfielder George Spriggs was selected as the AA Most Valuable Player (MVP). Though Omaha was unable to qualify for the playoffs over the next five seasons, two Royals were chosen for league awards during this stretch: second baseman Jim Wohlford as the 1972 Rookie of the Year and Mark Littell as the 1973 Most Valuable Pitcher. Many players from those early teams helped the Major League Royals win four out of five AL West titles from 1976 to 1980, culminating in a World Series appearance in 1980.

In 1976 and 1977, the Royals won back-to-back Eastern Division titles but lost both seasons&#x27; league championships to Denver. Outfielder Clint Hurdle was selected as the 1977 AA Rookie of the Year. Behind manager John Sullivan, Omaha won the 1978 Western Division title before winning their third American Association championship over the Indianapolis Indians, 4–1. The team next qualified for the playoffs in 1981 and 1982 but lost in the championship round each time, first to Denver and then Indianapolis. Joe Sparks won the Manager of the Year Award in 1981, and third baseman Manny Castillo was the same season&#x27;s MVP.

In February 1985, Kansas City sold the Omaha Royals to Chicago businessman Irving &quot;Gus&quot; Cherry for an undisclosed sum, citing financial losses from operating their own Triple-A club; their major league affiliation continued. Meanwhile, in the midst of another postseason drought from 1983 to 1987, Mark Huismann won the 1985 Most Valuable Pitcher Award.

Omaha won three consecutive Western Division titles from 1988 to 1989. On the first two occasions, they lost the AA championship to Indianapolis in the single-round playoffs. First baseman Luis de los Santos was the 1988 league MVP. Then, manager Sal Rende guided the team to a fourth American Association title with a 3–2 series win over the Nashville Sounds in 1990. The Royals capped off the season by winning the Triple-A Classic versus the International League champion Rochester Red Wings, 4–1. Rende was voted the league&#x27;s Manager of the Year.

The team was sold to the Union Pacific Railroad and minority investors Warren Buffett and Walter Scott for US$5 million following the 1991 season. From 1991 to 1997, the Royals made two postseason appearances in which they were eliminated in both the 1995 and 1996 semifinals. The 1994 season saw outfielder Dwayne Hosey selected as league MVP and first baseman Joe Vitiello win Rookie of the Year.

=== Pacific Coast League (1998–2020) ===

The American Association, of which the Royals had been members since 1969, disbanded after the 1997 season, and its teams were absorbed by the two remaining Triple-A leagues—the International League and Pacific Coast League (PCL). Omaha joined the PCL, becoming one of the easternmost team in the circuit. Though they did not qualify for the playoffs, two Royals outfielders were selected for league awards in the team&#x27;s first PCL season: Chris Hatcher as the Most Valuable Player and Jeremy Giambi as Rookie of the Year.

====First rebranding====

In early 1998, Omaha began considering a name change to distinguish the Royals from their major league affiliate and to market the minor league club as Omaha&#x27;s team rather than Kansas City&#x27;s Triple-A affiliate. Fans and team officials voted to rebrand as the Omaha Golden Spikes beginning with the 1999 seasons. The name was a reference to the golden spike driven at Promontory Summit, Utah, to celebrate the completion of the first transcontinental railroad in 1869. It was intended to celebrate the rich railroad tradition in Omaha, headquarters of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Golden Spikes won the 1999 American Conference Midwest Division title but lost the American Conference title to the Oklahoma RedHawks. Outfielder Mark Quinn was voted the PCL&#x27;s Rookie of the Year that season.

Union Pacific sold their 50-percent share in the team to Connecticut businessman Matt Minker in early 2001; Buffett and Scott retained their minority interests. Shortly thereafter, the team launched a fan vote to see about changing the team&#x27;s name, which had been associated with Union Pacific and proved to be unpopular with many fans. As a result, the team switched back to being the Omaha Royals beginning with the 2002 season as fans cited a wish to continue with the tradition associated with the name, which had been in use from 1969 to 1998. Minker later sold his interest in the team to Kentucky businessman Bill Shea in 2006.

From 2000 to 2010, the Royals regularly finished in third or fourth place out of four teams in their division, which left them out of the playoff picture. The team experienced several changes over the next few years. The 2010 season became the last that the team played at Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium, their home field since 1969. The team moved into the new $26-million Werner Park in 2011. 

====Second rebranding====

Prior to opening Werner Park, the team rebranded as the Omaha Storm Chasers following rounds of fan submissions and voting. The name references storm chasers, people who pursue any severe weather phenomena for various purposes; Nebraska, and Omaha itself, being in Tornado Alley, have been havens for many such chasers.

The Storm Chasers played their first home game at Werner Park on April 16, 2011, defeating the Nashville Sounds, 2–1, before 6,533 people in attendance. Manager Mike Jirschele led Omaha to a 79–63 record and the American Conference Northern Division title, which gave the team their first postseason berth since 1999. They defeated the Round Rock Express, 3–1, in the best-of-five American Conference series to advance to the league finals. The Storm Chasers won their first Pacific Coast League championship by sweeping the Sacramento River Cats, 3–0, in the best-of-five championship round. The win gave Omaha a spot in the Triple-A National Championship Game, a single game to determine a champion of Triple-A baseball, versus the International League champion Columbus Clippers, which they lost, 8–3. Jirschele won the Mike Coolbaugh Award, and Luis Mendoza was selected as the PCL Pitcher of the Year.

Jirschele&#x27;s Storm Chasers returned to the playoffs in 2012 by virtue of winning the division and won a second American Conference title, but they were defeated in the championship round by the Reno Aces, 3–1. In 2013 with Jirschele at the helm, Omaha finished the season at 70–74 with another division title. After besting the Oklahoma City RedHawks, 3–0, for the conference title, they won a second PCL championship over the Salt Lake Bees, 3–1. Returning to the Triple-A National Championship Game, Omaha defeated the International League&#x27;s Durham Bulls, 2–1, for their first class-level title since 1990. Managed by Brian Poldberg in 2014, Omaha won their fourth consecutive American Conference Northern Division title on the heels of a 76–67 season. After winning the conference title over the Memphis Redbirds, 3–1, Omaha won back-to-back PCL championships with a 3–2 series win over Reno. They also repeated as Triple-A champions by defeating the Pawtucket Red Sox, 4–2.

In the midst of a four-year playoff run, which would be Omaha&#x27;s last in the PCL, the team&#x27;s ownership changed hands in 2012. Bill Shea, Warren Buffett, and Walter Scott sold the team to Alliance Baseball LLC, led by managing owner Gary Green. The Storm Chasers did not qualify for the postseason from 2015 to 2019. The start of the 2020 season was initially postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before being cancelled altogether.

=== Triple-A East / International League (2021–present) ===

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Storm Chasers were placed in the Triple-A East. No playoffs were held to determine a league champion; instead, the team with the best regular-season record was declared the winner. Omaha ended the season in eighth place with a 66–54 record. However, 10 games that had been postponed from the start of the season were reinserted into the schedule as a postseason tournament called the Triple-A Final Stretch in which all 30 Triple-A clubs competed for the highest winning percentage. Omaha finished the tournament tied for fourth place with a 7–2 record. Jackson Kowar was selected as the league&#x27;s Pitcher of the Year, and shortstop Bobby Witt Jr. was chosen as its Top MLB Prospect. In 2022, the Triple-A East became known as the International League (IL), the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization. The Storm Chasers won the first-half of the 2024 season en route to the club&#x27;s first International League championship, which they secured after defeating the Columbus Clippers in a best-of-three series, 2–1. They were defeated by the PCL&#x27;s Sugar Land Space Cowboys, 13–6, in the Triple-A championship game. Manager Mike Jirschele, who led the team to a league-best 89–59 record, won the IL Manager of the Year Award.

====Sale====

In September 2024, owner Gary Green sold the Storm Chasers to Diamond Baseball Holdings in order to focus on the development of USL League One professional soccer team Union Omaha, of which he is also owner.

==Season-by-season records==


==Uniforms==

Omaha has several sets of uniforms. The home whites have &quot;Storm Chasers&quot; across the chest and the player&#x27;s number below in royal blue and gold, with royal blue piping around the neck, down the center of the jersey, and around the two sleeves. A Kansas City Royals patch adorns the left sleeve. The number on the back is a larger version of the one on the front, with the player&#x27;s name arching above it in blue. The white pants have a blue line running up both legs and are capped off with a blue belt. The primary hat is solid royal blue with a spinning tornado logo (Vortex) on the front.

One alternate jersey is powder blue with &quot;Storm Chasers&quot; across the front, similar to the home whites. These are often paired with a solid powder blue cap with an interlocking &quot;SC&quot; styled as a mixture of a tornado and a baseball. The player&#x27;s number is located on the back in white. A second alternate is solid royal blue with a logo on the left chest resembling an &quot;O&quot; with parts of a lightning bolt extending diagonally from the top and bottom. The player&#x27;s number appears on the back in gold. These are worn with solid blue caps bearing the same gold logo as on the jersey. A third alternate is black with a large O/lightning bolt logo in powder blue on the center with lightning bolts of the same color around the sides of the jersey. The player&#x27;s name is on the back in powder blue. These are paired with a powder blue cap with a black bill and black O/lightning bolt logo on the front.

==Roster==
==Achievements==
===Awards===

One member of the team has received an award issued by Minor League Baseball.

Fifteen players and four managers have won league awards in recognition for their performance with Omaha.



===Retired numbers===

The Storm Chasers have honored six individuals by retiring their uniform numbers. This ensures that the number will be associated with one player of particular importance to the team. The Kansas City Royals&#x27; retired numbers are also retired throughout their minor league organization. Three such numbers (5, 10, and 20) are thusly also retired in Omaha, while two others (23 and 27) are retired for Omaha personnel. An additional number (42) was retired across professional baseball to honor Jackie Robinson, the first African American to play in Major League Baseball in the modern era.

==Ownership==

Since being established in 1969, Omaha has had seven majority owners.

<text>The Sacramento River Cats are a Minor League Baseball team of the Pacific Coast League (PCL) and are the Triple-A affiliate of the San Francisco Giants. Prior to 2015, the River Cats were the Triple-A affiliate of the Oakland Athletics for 15 seasons. They are based in West Sacramento, California, and play their home games at Sutter Health Park, which opened in 2000 and was known as Raley Field through 2019.

Sacramento was previously represented in the Pacific Coast League by the Solons, a charter member of the league which was founded in 1903. Three different versions of the Solons played in California&#x27;s capital city in 1903, 1905, from 1909 to 1914, from 1918 to 1960, and from 1974 to 1976. The River Cats have played in the PCL since 2000, including the 2021 season in which it was known as the Triple-A West, and are the only charter city to still host a PCL team.

The River Cats have won five PCL championships. Recently they won the league crown in 2019; previously they won back-to-back in 2007 and 2008. They went on to win the Triple-A National Championship Game in all three seasons. Sacramento also won the PCL title in 2003 and 2004.

==History==
Following the 1999 season, the Pacific Coast League&#x27;s Vancouver Canadians were purchased by a group led by Art Savage, moved south to West Sacramento, and renamed the River Cats for the 2000 season. Savage was the majority owner of the team until his death at age 58 in November 2009. His widow, Susan Savage, became majority owner after her husband&#x27;s death.

In 2016, Mike Piazza became the first and only former River Cats player to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, after earning an 83% vote by the committee. Piazza played three games in Sacramento as part of a 2007 rehab assignment before rejoining the Oakland Athletics.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the River Cats were organized into the Triple-A West. They also entered into a new 10-year Professional Development License agreement to remain the Triple-A affiliate of the San Francisco Giants through 2030. Sacramento ended the season in fourth place in the Western Division with a 52–65 record. No playoffs were held to determine a league champion; instead, the team with the best regular-season record was declared the winner. However, 10 games that had been postponed from the start of the season were reinserted into the schedule as a postseason tournament called the Triple-A Final Stretch in which all 30 Triple-A clubs competed for the highest winning percentage. Sacramento finished the tournament tied for 20th place with a 4–6 record. In 2022, the Triple-A West became known as the Pacific Coast League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

In August 2022, owner Susan Savage sold a majority interest in the team to the Sacramento Kings.

In April 2024, it was announced that the major-league Oakland Athletics will be moving to Sacramento to play their home games at Sutter Health Park in 2025 and remain there until 2027 before officially moving their franchise to Las Vegas. The River Cats announced that, tentatively, they will remain as well, playing at Sutter Health Park on days when the Athletics are not playing there.

==Season-by-season records==


==Attendance==


After arriving at Raley Field in 2000, the River Cats led minor leagues in attendance for nine straight seasons. 

In 2015, the team drew 672,354 fans in 72 home games, leading the minor league in total attendance. In 2015, they also drew the second highest attendance per game in the minors with an average of 9,338 fans per game. 

For the 2017 season, the team drew 562,237 fans in 70 home games, placing them third in overall attendance for the Pacific Coast League. 
==Playoff history==
The River Cats have won 12 division titles, including back-to-back titles in 2000 and 2001, three years in a row from 2003 to 2005, and six consecutive titles from 2007 to 2012. In 2019, the River Cats snapped a six-year playoff drought by winning the Pacific Northern Division. 

The team has won four league championships: 2003, 2004, 2007, and 2008. In 2007, they defeated the Richmond Braves in that year&#x27;s Bricktown Showdown by a score of 7–1. In 2008 they defeated the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees, 4–1.

<text>Porrex I was a legendary king of the Britons as accounted by Geoffrey of Monmouth. He was the son of Gorboduc and his death began a dynastic civil war.

In the final years of Gorboduc&#x27;s life, Porrex waged war with his brother, Ferrex. He planned to ambush his brother but his brother fled to Gaul to enlist the aide of Suhard, the king of the Franks. When Ferrex returned with a large Gaulish army, Porrex attacked and Ferrex and the army were defeated. Some time after, his mother, Judon, avenged Porrex&#x27;s murder of Ferrex and hacked him to pieces in his sleep. His death sparked a civil war which would not be resolved until the reign of Dunvallo Molmutius. His death shifted the dominant genealogical royal house of Brutus to another house, Cornwall.

==Later tradition==
Porrex was a central character in Thomas Norton and Thomas Sackville&#x27;s play &quot;Gorboduc&quot; (1561).

<doc id="671235" wikidata="Q1230592" url="?curid=671235" title="Letocetum">
<text>Letocetum is the ancient remains of a Roman settlement. It was an important military staging post and posting station near the junction of Watling Street, the Roman military road to north Wales, and Icknield (or Ryknild) Street (now the A38). The site is now within the parish of Wall, Staffordshire, England. It is owned and run by the National Trust, under the name Letocetum Roman Baths Site &amp; Museum. The site is in the guardianship of English Heritage as Wall Roman Site.

The Romans came to Letocetum in 50 CE to establish a fortress during the early years of the invasion of Britain. The land could not support large numbers of soldiers and Letocetum, at an important cross-roads, became a large scale posting station. The settlement developed with successive bath houses and mansiones built to serve the official travellers as well as the growing civilian population. It is known mainly from detailed excavations in 1912–13, which concentrated on the sites of the mansio and bath-house.

The remains visible today are those of the stone bath house and mansio, built in approximately 130 CE after Letocetum ceased to have a military function and became a civilian settlement. The settlement reached its peak during the 2nd and 3rd centuries and at this time occupied 8.1–12 hectares (20–30 acres). At the end of the 3rd century, the town relocated within high defensive walls astride Watling Street. After the Romans left early in the 5th century the settlement went into decline. The modern village of Wall emerged in the land once occupied by Letocetum.

==Name==
The site is mentioned as Etocetum in the Antonine Itinerary and presumably represented a Latinisation of a Brittonic place name reconstructed as *Lētocaiton (&quot;Grey-wood&quot;; cf.   and modern Welsh &quot;&quot; ). The name possibly represented the species of tree prominent at the site such as ash and elm. Ford identifies the community as the (&quot;Fort Greywood&quot;) listed by Nennius among the 28 cities of Britain in his &quot;History of the Britains&quot;.

==History==

===Native settlement===
It is likely that a small native settlement occupied the site before the advent of the Romans, possibly as the main trading station on the boundary between two British tribes, the Corieltauvi in the East Midlands whose later tribal centre was at Ratae Corieltauvorum, and the Cornovii to the west with their original capital &quot;Uriconon&quot; (which would later give its name to the important Roman British city of Viroconium) at the hill fort on The Wrekin. These tribes offered little resistance to Roman rule.

===Military staging post===
In about 50 CE, a Roman vexillatio built a large timber fortress on a hilltop (near the site of the current church) at Letocetum. This housed the Legio XIV Gemina during the campaigns of governor Aulus Didius Gallus against the Brigantes. It was a good defensive position, but the poor farmland surrounding the fortress could not support large numbers of soldiers. During the Neronian period this initial fortress was replaced with a smaller one and Letocetum then developed into a large-scale posting station. Most of the troops moved to the fortress at Viroconium during the early administration of Gaius Suetonius Paulinus in about 58 CE.

===Posting station===

A mansio was built to provide lodging for official couriers travelling on Watling Street. A bath house was also built for the travellers and the growing civilian population. When the first mansio and bath house were completed, workers were needed to provide wood for the bath house, look after animals, and repair vehicles to be used by the official travellers. The civilian population would have provided many of these services. The native settlement grew during the Flavian period onwards to occupy . Roman burials with 1st and 2nd century pottery were found along Watling Street in 1927, and more in 1966. In the field between the mansio site and Watling Street, a round depression in the ground may mark the site of a Roman amphitheatre or a circular gyrus for training horses (an example has been excavated at the Lunt Roman Fort). A large earthenware vessel in the likeness of Minerva was found near the modern church, which may therefore be the site of a temple of Minerva. A rectangular crop-mark in the field to the north-west of the bath-house, only visible in dry weather, may be the site of another temple.

When the Legion XIV first settled at Letocetum they would have used existing trackways. A stone-surfaced road was needed to allow reliable movement. Watling Street was given a stone surface past Letocetum in about 70 CE. This date is approximated from two coins found in the centre of Letocetum beneath the first road surfacing. There is no evidence to indicate when Ryknild Street was constructed, but from the layout it is thought that Watling Street was built first. Watling Street stretched from Letocetum to London in one direction and to Wroxeter and Chester in the other. Ryknild Street, wide where it crossed with Watling Street, connected Letocetum with Cirencester to the south west and Yorkshire to the north east.

====Early mansiones and bath houses====
The foundations of the last mansio built at the site, and its associated bath-house, were uncovered by archaeologists in 1912–13. The rooms of both the mansio and bath-house were emptied and the stone foundations were exposed. This work left, in some lower stratified levels, traces of the two earlier wooden mansiones.

The hillside had been terraced and the first mansio, whose construction is dated to 54–60 CE, fully occupied one terrace. It was of a sleeper beam construction, the walls were wattle and daub, some were plastered and some were painted with simple linear decoration. It has been assumed the roof was thatch and was consumed when the building was destroyed by fire. The rooms were arranged around a square courtyard approximately . Due to the construction of later buildings the known layout of the first mansio is very fragmentary. The date at which the first mansio was destroyed is uncertain, it was probably near the beginning of the 2nd century, as the destruction layers contained Flavian-Trajanic samian-ware, part of a mortarium dating from 70–100 CE and part of a glass bowl which has been dated to the 2nd century.

The evidence for the layout of the second mansio is also very fragmentary. It was a courtyard building constructed with posts set vertically in foundation trenches. The walls were plaster and daub and some rooms were painted in vivid colours. In the courtyard was a large well and deep, cut into the underlying sandstone. The second mansio was deliberately dismantled in about 140–150 CE during construction of the third mansio. The well was filled in at this time and contained a samian sherd dated 125–145 CE. About the same time the second hilltop fort was abandoned and the town ceased to be a military site. One of the last military features at Letocetum was the &quot;punic ditch&quot; associated with this last small fort. The ditch was filled before any secondary silt formed and the filling contained a Trajanic coin dated 98–117 CE and pottery suggesting a Hadrianic or early Antonine date.

The earliest bath-house was discovered during an excavation in 1956. In a construction trench of the very first building was a worn coin of Vespasian dated 71 CE, due to the condition of the coin it is believed that this building was erected around 100 CE. It is thought that this building was built during the military period as the surviving masonry is of high quality with finely dressed stone and a wall some thick. It is thought that the second mansio, the last fort, and the first bath house all ended approximately at the end of the military period on the site.

====Civilian development; the third mansio and second bath-house====

Letocetum ceased to be used by the military after about 130 CE, probably leaving the town under the authority of the civitas of the Cornovii with its capital at Viroconium Cornoviorum. About this time that a new mansio and bath house were built.

The third and best-understood mansio was built on a stone base about 130 CE. It was at least two storeys high and fronted by a colonnade with a tiled roof, probably supported on wooden columns. In the centre of the colonnade, a large door formed the main entrance to the interior of the building. Through the entrance hall was a colonnaded atrium or courtyard with a plastered floor, the central area probably being open to the sky and perhaps containing a herbaceous garden. Timber posts resting on these foundations around the edges of the colonnade supported a balcony above.
The entrance hall was flanked on either side by similarly sized rooms probably accessible from the central courtyard. The one on the west contained washing facilities and a gutter leading to a soak-away in the central part of the building, the room to the east may possibly have been a guardroom. On the western side of the courtyard were three small rooms which opened out onto the central colonnade at ground level. The function of these rooms is uncertain, but they were probably used as private accommodation for users of the mansio. The largest room in the mansio lay in the north-east corner, the chamber was heated by a channelled hypocaust system added some time after the building was first completed.
To the west of the mansio lay the public bath-house, separated from it by a cobbled road between wide. From the street, a paved area led into a colonnade fronting the building on the east and continuing round the north side. Large doors in the centre of the eastern colonnade opened into a large, covered courtyard. This courtyard may have been a basilica; a settlement of this size would be expected to have one, and this is the only candidate on the site. At the far north end of the bath complex was the stoke-room or praefurnium, which contained the wood-fired furnaces of the hypocaust system. This underfloor heating system was present in the tepidarium, the caldarium and the laconicum where the floors were supported on pillars of tiles or pilae. The hot combustion gases from the stoke-room furnaces circulated under the floor between these pillars and were drawn up around the sides of the building through box tiles embedded in the walls, to escape finally through vents in the barrel-vaulted roof.

===Late Roman defences; abandoned mansio and bath-house===

Letocetum lost its public buildings near the end of the 3rd century; the bath-house and mansio were destroyed by fire. Around this time, very solid defences were built which did not include the bath-house or mansio sites. The reason the bath-house and mansio were abandoned can not be determined but the reason was probably economic. Other mansio sites around Britain appear to have been abandoned at this time. This did not imply an end to the posting service at Letocetum, it may have been a less costly reorganisation. The late defences were built in about 300 CE astride Watling Street, approximately east of the mansio site. The defences consisted of a stone wall about thick, fronted by three ditches and with a contemporary turf rampart to the rear, the area within the walls was . The northern and western sides were identified and sectioned in 1964 and the foundations of a wall at the south west corner were uncovered. On the western side a section of wall was found still standing high above shallow foundations but below the ploughed soil. The wall is believed to have been built within the period 275–325 CE.

It is thought that the construction of these defences was related to a general uprising of the Welsh tribes, the Ordovices and Silures, that occurred at this time. The revolt was soon quelled, but, to guard against further disruptions, a series of strongholds including Letocetum, Pennocrucium, and Uxacona were established along the length of Watling Street. All 4th century archaeological remains have come from within the defences and none from outside, suggesting that the whole population were within the defences by the 4th century. The latest coin to be found at Letocetum was minted in the time of the Emperor Gratian and dated to 381 CE. Roman administration collapsed at the beginning of the 5th century and nothing has been found at the site that is datable after this time.

===Post-Roman abandonment and later re-occupation===
The settlement must have been significant for some time; it is listed in the 9th-century &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, and Reno writes &quot;Wall, appearing as Cair Luitcoyt, and undoubtedly correctly ascribed, appears rather incongruously among such major towns and military depots as York, London, Chester, Wroxeter and Caerleon but nevertheless must have been a place of important consequence because of its inclusion as a strategic city.&quot; The late defences led to its description as a Caer and a British, possibly Powysian, outpost was established there. We have no knowledge of the period immediately after the Roman departure as no historical or archaeological evidence is present.

Letocetum lost all importance with the development of nearby Lichfield in the 7th century as the seat of a Bishop. When the place again emerged historically it was under a new name, Wall. This name referred to the remains of the late Roman defences, parts of which were still standing in the early 19th century.

<doc id="671256" wikidata="Q2443061" url="?curid=671256" title="Emilio Carranza">
<text>Captain Emilio Carranza Rodríguez (December 9, 1905 – July 12, 1928), was a Mexican aviator and national hero, nicknamed the &quot;Lindbergh of Mexico&quot;. He was killed on the return part of a historic goodwill flight from Mexico City to the United States. He crashed in New Jersey shortly after take-off from New York.

==Early life and background==
Carranza was born in Villa Ramos Arizpe, Coahuila, Mexico, on December 9, 1905. His father was Sebastian Carranza who was an attache at the Mexican consulate in New York. His mother was Maria Dolores Rodriguez Gomez. As a child he lived for some time in San Antonio, El Paso, and Mexico City. He was fluent in English. He attended the Military Academy at Mexico City and graduated in 1924 with honors. He married Maria Luisa Corbala in 1928 four months before taking the flight to the USA. Following his death, He left a wife and unborn child. The child, Emilio Carranza Jr. was born after his crash. The child died at age 6 of an appendicitis. He was the great-nephew of President Venustiano Carranza of Mexico and his elder second cousin was Mexican aviator Alberto Salinas Carranza, whom he called &quot;uncle.&quot; At age 18, he took part against the Yaqui rebellion in Sonora and helped to put down the de la Huerta rebellion.

==Aviation career==
===Aviation records===
Carranza was known to have set a number of aviation records. In 1927 he made the first non-stop flight from Mexico City to Ciudad Juárez (1200 miles). While in Sonora, he crashed and his face had to be reassembled with platinum screws. At age 22, on May 24–25, 1928, he set the record for the third longest non-stop solo flight by flying 1,575 miles (3000 km) from San Diego, California, to Mexico City in 18.5 h. His safe arrival completed the longest non-stop flight by a Mexican. He was greeted by Plutarco Calles, then President of Mexico.

===US Goodwill Flight===
====Washington DC====
In 1928, he became a national hero when he was selected to undertake a goodwill flight from Valbuena Airfield in Mexico City to Washington, D.C., in response to the previous year&#x27;s flight between the two capitals by Charles Lindbergh. He received the plane on May 20 from the factory. After a number of short practice flights in Tampico, to test gasoline and maintaining altitude, Emilio was ready for his distance flight. Flying his plane The Mexico Excelsior, a Ryan Brougham similar to the Spirit of St. Louis, Carranza reached Washington, D.C., on June 12, 1928, after a forced landing in Mooresville, North Carolina. The reason for the forced landing was fog. The goodwill flight was partially financed by Charles Lindbergh who contributed $1200 to help finance the flight. The American Syrian Federation also contributed financial assistance to pay for the flight. However, the bulk of the money for the good-will flight came from a public collection in Mexico. $25,000 was raised for his trip.

At Bolling Field, he was greeted by Acting Secretary of State Robert Olds, Mexican Ambassador Miguel Téllez, other dignitaries and spectators. The next day, he had lunch with U.S. President Calvin Coolidge, who hosted the aviator at the Pan American Union. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the two had to have lunch there because The White House larder was empty due to the first family&#x27;s impending departure for a vacation. While in Washington, he placed a wreath on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

====New York====
Flying on to New York, he was escorted by an air squadron from Bolling Field. Carranza landed at Roosevelt Field on Long Island. A crowd of people, 200 soldiers and 12 motorcycle policemen were on hand to greet him; as well as a military band. He was honored in New York City by Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover and New York City mayor Jimmy Walker. Mayor Jimmy Walker gave him the key to the city. Mayor Walker also later invited Carranza to a firemen&#x27;s ceremony where he requested Carranza do the honor to present medals to the firemen for heroic work. He was honored at a lunch at the Garden City Hotel given by the Nassau County official Reception Committee. A luncheon was also held at the Bankers Club for Carranza and 200 guests given by the Mexican Chamber of Commerce.

He then flew to West Point where he also reviewed the troops, an honor infrequently given to a visiting official with the rank of just Captain. When at West Point, he presented a picture of the Mexican Military Academy at Chapultepec. Following West Point, he flew to Lowell, Massachusetts, to dedicate a new field there. He went at the request of Edith Nourse Rogers who was responsible for the lifting of an embargo of aviation products to Mexico. He then returned to New York City.

He was also honored at a reception given by the American Syrian Federation in Brooklyn. At the reception, he was given a wrist watch and a scroll offering good wishes. He stated at the dinner that Mexican Syrians had contributed a third of the money to pay for the expenses of his flight. He was also honored with a luncheon on Governors Island and then that evening was honored at a dance at Hotel McAlpin. Those in attendance at the Luncheon were his father Sebastian Carranza, General Pedro Caloca, Robert Lee Bullard, and Hugh A. Drum among others. Owing to violent weather, he was urged to remain in New York by Charles Lindbergh and others.

====Return flight and crash====
There is a story that on July 12 Carranza received a telegram from Mexican War Minister Joaquín Amaro ordering his immediate return to Mexico City &quot;or the quality of your manhood will be in doubt.&quot; According to the legend, the telegram was found at the crash site in the pocket of the aviator&#x27;s flight jacket, but the telegram no longer exists. The story&#x27;s proponents do not cite any primary source that confirms the telegram&#x27;s existence.

Contemporary news reports contradict the story. According to the July 13 edition of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Carranza departed after receiving a report via telegram from the US Weather Bureau, but it is unclear whether the weather report prompted his departure. Airport officials said he announced a delay so that spectators would leave the field. There was also an unsubstantiated statement from Senator Thomas Heflin that there was a report of a plot to kill Carranza.

Carranza took off after dark during a break in thunderstorms in the New York region. He reported before taking off that he would fly towards Washington and then steer a compass course from there. While flying over the Pinelands of southern New Jersey amidst thunderstorms, he crashed into the woods. Investigators from Fort Monmouth conducted the accident probe to determine what happened. They were able to determine the engine throttle was closed and the spark lever was in the advanced position. This showed he was attempting to land.

John H. Carr, and his family were out picking huckleberries when they discovered his body and the wreckage the next day. His corpse was wrapped in canvas from the plane&#x27;s fuselage and taken to a garage behind Buzby&#x27;s General Store in Chatsworth where it was placed in a makeshift coffin. His casket, accompanied by United States Army officers, was draped with an American flag from Mount Holly Post 11 of the American Legion, and then taken to New York City. The flag hangs today in Mexico&#x27;s School of Aviation. Many personal effects were looted from the crash site during the investigation. Three days later some medals, rings and clothing were turned into the local police. These items were eventually turned over to the airman&#x27;s family. The Mexican government rewarded John Carr with $500 for finding and quickly reporting the location of the plane and body.

Authorities initially identified Carranza&#x27;s body from the Weather Bureau telegram found in his flight jacket pocket, according to news reports. Authorities described to reporters the belongings found on his body, but made no reference to a telegram from Minister Amaro. The news reports are contrary to the Amaro telegram story published on the 50th anniversary of the aviator&#x27;s death, which states that the Minister&#x27;s telegram was found in Carranza&#x27;s jacket pocket.

====Body repatriation and final resting place====
United States President Coolidge offered the battleship &quot;Florida&quot; to return the body. President Calles, the President of Mexico, declined the offer and the body was returned to Mexico via train transport amid full military honors. The military guard were dispatched from Governors Island. When transferred to the train at Penn Station, the coffin was led by six black horses in a caisson with 10,000 troops marching to a muffled drum beat down Broadway. It was estimated that 200,000 people lined the route to see the coffin draped procession. Every Mexican military officer was ordered to wear crape on his sword hilt and a black brassard on his arm in honor of Carranza. National flags were flown at half-staff for a week.

Carranza&#x27;s remains were interred at the Rotunda of Illustrious Persons in a procession of 100,000 marchers. Military officers linked arms to keep clear the view for the family. An airplane formation flew overhead. He was posthumously promoted to General.

In 1929, Edward T. M. Carr, Superintendent of the Southern Division of the Long Branch Railroad, on a good will tour, stopped in Mexico City to deliver to Mexico City officials a pine tree from the scene of the crash. It was planted adjacent to his grave site.

== Legacy ==

===Carranza memorial===

In 1931, a 12 ft (3.6 m) monument in the Wharton State Forest in Tabernacle Township, New Jersey, marks the site of his crash . The monument, installed with funds donated by Mexican schoolchildren, depicts a falling eagle of Aztec design. Each year in July, on the Saturday nearest the anniversary of his crash (second Saturday in July) at 1:00 p.m. he is honored at the monument site by members of the American Legion Medford post 526 accompanied by an entourage from the Mexican consulates in New York City and Philadelphia. Originally drawing thousands, attendance at the annual memorial had been reduced to a handful of people.

The donated monolith was created with each side representing a symbol of Carranza and his love of aviation. The monument was funded by the children of Mexico who saved their coins to create this obelisk-looking statue. The stones for the monument were quarried from granite mined near his home and each block represented a different Mexican State.

Constructed in the form of a giant pylon, with squared tapered sided, the image of an Aztec eagle is carved on one side. On the other side, there is an arrow, pointing skyward. Another side has an inscription. It shows some deterioration and some letters in the message are missing. The message states &quot;Messenger of Peace... The (p)eople of Mexico Hope that your high ideal(s) will be rea(l)ized... Homage of the children of Mexico to the aviator captain Emilio Carranza who died tragically on July 13, 1928 in his good will flight&quot;. In the final side, there are embedded footprints which represent the famed aviator&#x27;s final walk on the planet. The Monument was crafted and shipped from Mexico.

===Additional memorials===
A memorial was planned near the spot where Carranza landed in Mooresville, North Carolina, during his flight to Washington D.C. A committee was established to design the memorial. However, the memorial was never built.

===Annual ceremony===
There is an annual ceremony for Carranza held at the Air Force Academy in Mexico City.

===Carranza Memorial Park===
Following the crash in 1928, a small marker was placed where the aviator&#x27;s body was found. Following the monument placement in 1931, a park was created to memorialize the aviator in 1933. The park originally comprised 10 acres. However, it was absorbed into Wharton State Forrest. There is a monument sign close to the monument which state:s &quot;Monument - Captain Emilio Carranza fell to his death while returning to Mexico on a good will flight in 1928. Pennies of Mexican Children&quot;.

Introduced June 24, 1999, by Senator Leonard T. Connors Jr and Diane Allen Senate bill No. 2025 establishes the &quot;Emilio Carranza Memorial Commission&quot;; it additionally appropriates $95,000. The focus of the bill was to primarily provide for the restoration and maintenance of the Emilio Carranza memorial monument.

On July 8, 2005, the memorial which was vandalized was restored. Two men were charged in connection to the monument vandalization which was spray-painted in May 2005 with &quot;white power&quot; and &quot;Die all Wetbacks&quot;. There was also a swastika. The work was performed by T. Scott Kreilick, whose Pennsylvania-based conservation company have also restored headstones at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and New York City&#x27;s botanical garden.

In 2007, documentary filmmaker Dr Robert A. Emmons Jr. completed and premiered a feature-length documentary (Goodwill: The Flight of Emilio Carranza) which detailed the life of Carranza and the role of the American Legion Post 11 as well as the town of Chatsworth, New Jersey&#x27;s involvement in his recovery and memorial. According to Emmons Jr: &quot;Goodwill, the documentary film, presents Carranza&#x27;s life and the legacy he has left in both Mexico and the United States of America. The film goes further as it investigates the differences between Carranza&#x27;s legacy in these two nations brought on by social, political, and historical factors. Finally, the film is meant to be bring another layer to Carranza and Lindbergh&#x27;s goal of establishing a lasting goodwill between these two nations.&quot; 

In April 2009, J&amp;J Video Producers of Chicago premiered their documentary film titled &quot;FLYING WITH EMILIO&quot;. The documentary details the life of Emilio Carranza and the continued role of the American Legion Post 11 of Mount Holly, NJ&#x27;s involvement in his recovery and their annual Memorial Service.

On July 11, 2015, the 87th annual Tribute was attended by Commander of the Mexican Air Force, Lt. Gen. Carlos Antonio Rodriguez-Munguia and Maj. Gen. Victor Aguirre-Serna who presented a wreath. A portrait and model of his airplane were on display during the ceremony.

===Postage stamps===
A year following his death Mexico issued in July 1929 commemorative postage stamps to mark Emilio Carranza&#x27;s Goodwill Flight: 20c brown and blue black, 50c brown red &amp; blue black, 1p blue black &amp; brown, 5c olive green &amp; black, 10c black &amp; brown red, and 5c violet &amp; dark green stamps.

For the 20th anniversary in July 1947, Mexico issued a 10 peso commemorative stamp.

On the 50th anniversary of his death in August 1978, Mexico issued an Air Mail stamp.

<doc id="671259" wikidata="Q567601" url="?curid=671259" title="Golden Bull of 1356">
<text>The Golden Bull of 1356 (, , , , ) was a decree issued by the Imperial Diet at Nuremberg and Metz (Diet of Metz, 1356/57) headed by the Emperor Charles IV which fixed, for a period of more than four hundred years, important aspects of the constitutional structure of the Holy Roman Empire. It was named the &quot;Golden Bull&quot; for the golden seal it carried.

In June 2013, the Golden Bull was included in the UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World Register.

==Background==
According to the written text of the Golden Bull of 1356:

Though the election of the King of the Romans by the chief ecclesiastical and secular princes of the Holy Roman Empire was well established, disagreements about the process and papal involvement had repeatedly resulted in controversies, most recently in 1314 when Louis of Bavaria and Frederick of Austria had been elected by opposing sets of electors. Louis, who had eventually subdued his rival&#x27;s claim on the battlefield, made a first attempt to clarify the process in the Declaration of Rhense of 1338, which renounced any papal involvement and had restricted the right to choose a new king to the prince-electors. The Golden Bull, promulgated by Louis&#x27;s successor and rival, Charles IV, was more precise in several ways.

==Prince-electors==

Firstly, the Bull explicitly named the seven Prince-electors (&quot;Kurfürsten&quot;) who were to choose the King and also defined the &quot;Reichserzämter&quot;, their (largely ceremonial) offices at court:


Secondly, the principle of majority voting was explicitly stated for the first time in the Empire. The Bull prescribed that four (out of seven) votes would always suffice to elect a new King; as a result, three Electors could no longer block the election. Thirdly, the Electoral principalities were declared indivisible, and succession to them was regulated to ensure that the votes would never be divided. Finally, the Bull cemented a number of privileges for the Electors, confirming their elevated role in the Empire. It is therefore also a milestone in the establishment of largely independent states in the Empire, a process to be concluded only centuries later, notably with the Peace of Westphalia of 1648.

This codification of prince-electors, though largely based on precedence, was not uncontroversial, especially in regard to the two chief rivals of the ruling House of Luxembourg:
*The House of Wittelsbach ruled the Duchy of Bavaria as well as the County Palatinate. Dynastic divisions had caused the two territories to devolve upon distinct branches of the house. The Treaty of Pavia, which in 1329 restored the Palatinate branch, stipulated that Bavaria and the Palatinate would alternate in future elections, but the Golden Bull fixed the electoral vote upon the Palatinate and not upon Bavaria, partly because Charles&#x27;s predecessor and rival Louis IV was of that branch. Louis IV&#x27;s sons, Louis V and Stephen II of Bavaria, protested this omission, feeling that Bavaria, one of the original duchies of the realm and their family&#x27;s chief territory for over 170 years, deserved primacy over the Palatinate. The omission of Bavaria from the list of prince-electors also allowed Bavaria, which had only recently been reunited, to fall into dynastic fragmentation again. Brandenburg was in the hands of the Bavarian Wittelsbachs (though held by a junior member of the house) in 1356; they eventually lost the territory to the Luxemburgs in 1373, leaving the Bavarian branch without representation in the electoral college until 1623.
*The House of Habsburg, long-time rivals of the Luxembourgs, were completely omitted from the list of prince-electors, leading to decreased political influence and dynastic fragmentation. In retaliation, Duke Rudolf IV, one of the dukes of fragmented Austria, had the &quot;Privilegium Maius&quot; forged, a document supposedly issued by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. The document gave Austria – elevated to the position of an Archduchy – special privileges, including primogeniture. While ignored by the Emperor and other princes at the time, the document was eventually ratified when Frederick of Austria himself became Emperor in the 15th century. Still, the Habsburgs remained without an electoral vote until they succeeded to the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1526.

==Procedures==

The bull regulated the whole election process in great detail, listing explicitly where, when, and under which circumstances what should be done by whom, not only for the prince-electors but also (for example) for the population of Frankfurt, where the elections were to be held, and also for the counts of the regions the prince-electors had to travel through to get there. The decision to hold the elections in Frankfurt reflected a traditional feeling dating from East Frankish days that both election and coronation ought to take place on Frankish soil. However, the election location was not the only specified location; the bull specified that the coronation would take place in Aachen, and Nuremberg would be the place where the first diet of a reign should be held. The elections were to be concluded within thirty days; failing that, the bull prescribed that the prince-electors were to receive only bread and water until they had decided:

Besides regulating the election process, the chapters of the Golden Bull contained many minor decrees. For instance, it also defined the order of marching when the emperor was present, both with and without his insignia. A relatively major decision was made in chapter 15, where Charles IV outlawed any , and , meaning in particular the city alliances (), but also other communal leagues that had sprung up through the communal movement in mediaeval Europe. Most were subsequently dissolved, sometimes forcibly, and where refounded, their political influence was much reduced. Thus the Golden Bull also strengthened the nobility in general to the detriment of the cities.
The pope&#x27;s involvement with the Golden Bull of 1356 was basically nonexistent, which was significant in the history of relations between the popes and the emperors. When Charles IV laid down procedure for electing a King of the Romans, he mentioned nothing about receiving papal confirmation of the election. However, Pope Innocent VI did not protest this because he needed Charles’s support against the Visconti. Pope Innocent continued to have good relations with Charles IV after the Golden Bull of 1356 until the former&#x27;s death in 1362.

<text>Abell 1835 IR1916 (also known as Abell 1835, Galaxy Abell 1835, Galaxy Abell 1835 IR1916, or simply The Abell) was a candidate for being the most distant galaxy ever observed, although that claim has not been verified by additional observations. It was claimed to lie behind the galaxy cluster Abell 1835, in the Virgo constellation.

==Initial observation==

Abell 1835 was discovered by French and Swiss astronomers of the European Southern Observatory, namely Roser Pelló, Johan Richard, Jean-François Le Borgne, Daniel Schaerer, and Jean-Paul Kneib. The astronomers used a near-infrared instrument on the Very Large Telescope to detect the galaxy; other observatories were then used to make an image of it possible. The Observatory, in conjunction with the Swiss National Science Foundation, the French Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, and the journal &quot;Astronomy and Astrophysics&quot;, issued a press release on 1 March 2004 announcing the discovery. It was believed to be more distant than the galaxy lensed by Abell 2218.

==Age and distance==

The initial observer&#x27;s analysis of J-band observations indicated that Abell 1835 IR1916 has a redshift factor of z~10.0, meaning that it appears to us as it was about 13.2 billion years ago, only 470 million years after the Big Bang and very close to the first burst of star formation in the universe. Its visibility at such a great distance was credited to gravitational lensing by the galaxy cluster Abell 1835 between it and us.

Further analysis of the data that led to the first announcement has cast doubt on the claim that it is a distant object, and follow-up observations in the H-band using the Gemini North Telescope and observations from the orbiting Spitzer Space Telescope were not able to detect it at all, the latter regarding it to be an artefact.

<doc id="671261" wikidata="Q3357766" url="?curid=671261" title="Ottawa—Vanier (federal electoral district)">
<text>Ottawa—Vanier (formerly known as Ottawa East) is a federal electoral district in Ontario, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1935. Previous to that date, it was part of the Ottawa electoral district that returned two members.

The riding generally corresponds to the wards of Beacon Hill-Cyrville, Rideau-Rockcliffe and Rideau-Vanier.

The riding became vacant because of the death of incumbent MP Mauril Bélanger on August 16, 2016. Mona Fortier was elected in the byelection to fill the seat on April 3, 2017.

The riding, with a large Franco-Ontarian population in Vanier, is one of the most solidly Liberal in the country, having elected Liberals both federally and provincially in every election since its creation. In fact, the previous electoral district which comprises most of the constituency, Russell, had been solidly Liberal since 1887. The riding is home to many civil servants.

==Political geography==
About 15% of the riding is in the former city of Vanier, which was amalgamated into Ottawa in 2001. Vanier has long been home to much of Ottawa&#x27;s francophone population, a group that has traditionally been solidly Liberal. The riding also contains the wealthiest part of Ottawa, the former village Rockcliffe Park, which has supported both the Conservatives, and the Liberals in recent elections. The anglophone middle class neighbourhoods of Sandy Hill, containing the University of Ottawa, and New Edinburgh also tend to vote Liberal, but with significant support for the New Democratic Party. In 2011, the NDP won Sandy Hill, Lower Town, Vanier and in Overbrook. The Conservatives won in the more suburban parts of the riding like in Beacon Hill and Pineview.

==Geography==

In 2003, it was redefined as the part of the City of Ottawa east and north of a line running south along the Rideau Canal from the interprovincial boundary to Mann Avenue, northeast to Nicholas Street, southeast to Highway 417, and east to the abandoned Canadian Pacific Railway to the hydroelectric transmission line, north to Innes Road, northeast to Blair Road, northwest to Montreal Road, east and northeast to Regional Road 174, northeast to Green&#x27;s Creek, north to the Ottawa River.

==Demographics==
&quot;According to the 2021 Canadian census&quot;

Ethnic groups: 60.2% White, 14.5% Black, 5.5% Indigenous, 5.2% Arab, 3.6% South Asian, 2.8% Chinese, 1.9% Latin American, 1.6% Filipino, 1.5% West Asian

Languages: 47.1% English, 23.5% French, 4.2% Arabic, 1.9% Spanish, 1.3% Mandarin

Religions: 53.8% Christian (33.5% Catholic, 3.1% Anglican, 2.0% United Church, 1.8% Christian Orthodox, 1.1% Pentecostal, 12.3% Other), 9.5% Muslim, 32.8% None

Median income: $42,400 (2020)

Average income: $57,600 (2020)

==History==

The federal riding was created as &quot;Ottawa East&quot; in 1933 from parts of Ottawa and Russell ridings.

It initially consisted of, in the city of Ottawa, Rideau, Ottawa, By, St. Georges wards and the northeast part of Riverdale Ward, the town of Eastview, and the village of Rockcliffe Park.

In 1947, it was redefined to exclude the town of Eastview. In 1952, it was redefined to consist of the village of Rockcliffe Park, and the eastern parts of the city of Ottawa. In 1966, it was redefined to include the City of Eastview and exclude the village of Rockcliffe Park.

The name of the electoral district was changed in 1973 to &quot;Ottawa—Vanier&quot;.

In 1976, it was redefined to consist of the City of Vanier, and the eastern parts of the city of Ottawa. In 1987, it was redefined to consist of the City of Vanier, the eastern part of the city of Ottawa, part of the city of Gloucester and the Village of Rockcliffe Park. In 1996, the Ottawa and Gloucester parts of the riding were redefined.

In 2003, it was given its current boundaries that are described above.

Following the Canadian federal electoral redistribution, 2012, the riding gained the neighbourhood of Beacon Hill South from Ottawa—Orléans.

Following the 2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution, this riding will be renamed Ottawa—Vanier—Gloucester at the first election held after approximately April 2024. It will gain Blackburn Hamlet from Orléans and will lose a small territory south of Innes Road to Prescott—Russell—Cumberland.

<text>Alfred Oerter Jr. (; September 19, 1936 – October 1, 2007) was an American athlete and a four-time Olympic Champion in the discus throw. He was the first athlete to win a gold medal in the same individual event in four consecutive Olympic Games. Oerter is an inductee of the IAAF Hall of Fame.

==Olympic athlete==
Oerter was born in 1936 in Astoria, Queens, New York City and grew up in New Hyde Park; he attended Sewanhaka High School in Floral Park. He began his track and field career at the age of 15 when a discus landed at his feet and he threw it back past the crowd of throwers. Oerter continued throwing and eventually earned a scholarship to the University of Kansas in 1954 where he became a member of Delta Tau Delta fraternity. A large man of almost 6&#x27; 4&quot; (193 cm) and 280 pounds (127 kg), Oerter was a natural thrower. Competing for Kansas, he became the NCAA discus champion in 1957; he successfully defended his title the following year.

Oerter began his Olympic career at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. He was not considered the favorite but he felt a rush during the competition and he unleashed a throw of —which, at the time, was a career best. The throw was good enough to win the competition by more than .

In 1957, it seemed that Oerter&#x27;s career would be over at the age of 20 when he was nearly killed in an automobile accident. He recovered in time to compete at the 1960 Summer Olympics at Rome, where he was the slight favorite over teammate Rink Babka, who was the world record holder.

Babka was in the lead for the first four of the six rounds. He gave Oerter advice before his fifth throw; Oerter threw his discus , setting an Olympic record. Babka settled for the silver medal when he was not able to beat Oerter&#x27;s throw.

During the early 1960s, Oerter continued to have success and set his first world record in 1962. In the process, he was the first to break 200 feet in the discus. He was considered a heavy favorite to win a third gold medal at Tokyo in 1964.

Oerter was hampered by injuries before the Games began. He was bothered by a neck injury that required him to wear a neck brace, and a week before the start of the competition he tore cartilage in his ribs. Oerter was competing in great pain, but he set a new Olympic standard and won a third Olympic gold medal despite not being able to take his last throw due to the pain from his ribs. He had told the doctors, &quot;These are the Olympics. You die for them&quot;.
Oerter returned to the Olympics in 1968 at Mexico City; however, teammate Jay Silvester was cast as the favorite. Many felt Oerter, who was then 32, could not win the event because he had never thrown as far as Silvester did on his average throws. At the Olympics, however, Oerter hurled another Olympic record throw of on his third throw. His record held and he became the first track and field athlete to win gold medals in four consecutive Olympic Games. This accomplishment would be equaled many years later by fellow Americans Carl Lewis in 1996, swimmer Michael Phelps in 2016, and swimmer Katie Ledecky in 2024.

Oerter retired from athletics after the 1968 Olympics. He later eyed a comeback and took anabolic steroids in 1976 under medical supervision in order to put on muscle mass. However, he stopped the course as this affected his blood pressure and failed to give much improvement on the field. After this he advised athletes to avoid such drugs and focus on training and technique instead. He was critical of the increase of drug use and the subsequent testing in track and field, stating that it had destroyed the culture of athlete camaraderie and that the banning of athletes such as Ben Plucknett was merely scapegoating by international officials.

Oerter did make an attempt to qualify for the American team in 1980 but finished fourth. He nonetheless set his overall personal record of that year at the age of 43. Dr. Gideon Ariel, a former Olympic shot putter himself for Israel, had developed a business of biomechanical services, and Oerter after working with Ariel—at age 43—threw a discus 27 feet farther than his best gold medal performance.

When filming for a TV segment, he unofficially threw about , which would have set a still-standing world record. In later years, Oerter carried the Olympic flag for the 1984 Summer Olympics, then carried Olympic flame into the stadium for the 1996 Olympic Games.

==Later life, death and Art of the Olympians==
Oerter had struggled with high blood pressure his entire life, and in the 2000s, he became terminally ill with cardiovascular disease. On March 13, 2003, Oerter experienced a period of being clinically dead; a change of blood pressure medications caused a fluid build-up (Pericardial effusion) around his heart.

Oerter was inducted into the Suffolk Sports Hall of Fame on Long Island in the Track &amp; Field Category with the Class of 1990. In 2005, Oerter was inducted into the Nassau County Sports Hall of Fame.

As a child, Oerter had frequently traveled to his grandparents&#x27; home in Manhattan and admired their art collection. As a retired athlete, Oerter became an abstract painter. Oerter enjoyed the freedom of abstract art, and thus decided against formal schooling for his art, as he thought it might stifle his creativity. Part of Oerter&#x27;s work was his &quot;Impact&quot; series of paintings. For these works, Oerter would lay a puddle of a paint on a tarp, and fling a discus into it to create splashing lines on a canvas positioned in front of the tarp. If the discus landed painted-face up, Oerter would sign it and give it to whoever purchased the painting.

In 2006 he founded the Art of the Olympians organization and held an Olympian Art exhibition in his home town of Fort Myers. This first show included artworks and sculptures from 14 Olympians, including Florence Griffith Joyner, Roald Bradstock, Shane Gould, Cameron Myler, Rink Babka and Larry Young. Later that year the exhibit traveled to New York City for shows at the United Nations, the New York Athletic Club and then at the National Arts Club. Art of the Olympians also had their work on display on the giant Panasonic Astro-Vision screen in Times Square for the entire month November 2006. Oerter and other Olympian artists were also featured on the CBS Morning Show to discuss their New York Tour.

In mid-2007, Art of the Olympians was given the rights to use the word Olympian by the United States Olympic Committee (USOC)—an act protected by Congress. On August 1, 2007, Art of the Olympians was awarded a 501(c)(3) status.

As Oerter&#x27;s heart condition progressed, he was advised by cardiologists that he would require a heart transplant. Oerter dismissed the suggestion. &quot;I&#x27;ve had an interesting life,&quot; he said, &quot;and I&#x27;m going out with what I have.&quot; Oerter died on October 1, 2007, of heart failure in Fort Myers, Florida at the age of 71. He was survived by his wife and two daughters.

Upon learning of Oerter&#x27;s death, track and field historian and blogger Mike Young wrote that Oerter was arguably the greatest Olympian of all time.

On March 7, 2009, the Al Oerter Recreation Center, operated by New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, opened in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in Flushing, Queens.

<text>William Cameron Forbes (May 21, 1870 – December 24, 1959) was an American investment banker and diplomat. He served as governor-general of the Philippines from 1909 to 1913 and ambassador of the United States to Japan from 1930 to 1932.

He was the son of William Hathaway Forbes, president of the Bell Telephone Company, who was part of the Boston Brahmin family that made its fortune trading in China, and wife Edith Emerson, a daughter of Ralph Waldo Emerson. He was grandson of Sarah Hathaway and John Murray Forbes and Lidian Jackson and Ralph Waldo Emerson. After education at the Milton Academy and Boston&#x27;s Hopkinson School and graduation from Harvard in 1892, he embarked on a business career, eventually becoming a partner in J. M. Forbes and Company.

==Philippines==
During the administration of President William Howard Taft, Forbes was Governor-General of the Philippines from 1909 to 1913. Previously, during the administration of President Theodore Roosevelt, he had been Commissioner of Commerce and Police in the American colonial Insular Government of the Philippines from 1904 through 1908; and he was Vice Governor from 1908 through 1909.

Forbes was an enthusiastic supporter of the summer capital at Baguio designed by Daniel Burnham, and had a country club and golf course added to the plans. The summer capital drew resentment from local Filipinos, as it put the government at a distance from the people and was paid for with money earmarked for postwar recovery. Forbes had a low opinion of Filipinos, regarding them as naturally subordinate and unready for self-government. He interacted with them as little as possible. In a 1909 diary entry he recounted an incident when he was playing golf with an Igorot caddy. Forbes wrote &quot;I said to myself, &#x27;Now how many am I?&#x27; and the boy replied, &#x27;Playing five.&#x27; I was as much astonished as though a tree had spoken.&quot; Of the original 161 country club members only six were Filipino. One of them was future Philippines president Manuel Quezon. Forbes likened him to a &quot;wonderfully trained hunting dog gone wild.&quot; Quezon in turn remarked that Forbes loved Filipinos &quot;in the same way the former slave owners loved their Negro slaves.&quot; In 1908 diary entry, Forbes described how he and the other lawmakers completed their business at Baguio in &quot;about an hour or less&quot; and devoted the remainder of the day to leisure.

Forbes, who was a polo enthusiast, founded the Manila Polo Club in 1919 in Pasay, Rizal. It was the first polo field in the Philippines. Forbes had envisioned the club as a venue for polo and leisure for &quot;gentlemen of a certain class&quot; assigned to work in the Philippines like himself. He served as delegate of the club until the outbreak of World War II. The clubhouse was inaugurated on November 27, 1909.

In 1921, President Warren G. Harding sent Forbes and Leonard Wood as heads of the Wood-Forbes Commission to investigate conditions in the Philippines. The Commission concluded that Filipinos were not yet ready for independence from the United States, a finding that was widely criticized in the Philippines.

The gated community of Forbes Park in Makati, was named after him; and this community is the residence of some of the wealthiest people in the country. Lacson Avenue (formerly Gov. Forbes Street) in Sampaloc, Manila is still called &quot;Forbes&quot; by some up to the present day.

==Haiti==
Forbes was appointed by President Herbert Hoover in 1930 to lead a commission charged with investigating the reasons for ongoing minor rebellions in Haiti. Forbes gave Hoover a plan to stabilize Haiti and remove the US Marines. An agreement in August 1931 started the withdrawal and a similar plan led to Hoover&#x27;s withdrawal of troops from Nicaragua. Franklin Roosevelt later completed the process, calling it the &quot;Good Neighbor policy.&quot;

==Japan==
Forbes was nominated by President Hoover and confirmed as United States Ambassador to Japan. He served from 1930 to 1932.

In 1935, Forbes headed an American Economic Mission to Japan and China to promote good business relations. The April 9, 1935 photo to the right presents Forbes meeting with the Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry, Machida Chūji, at the official residence of Machida, in Tokyo. Together, they renegotiated agreements that would improve commercial relations between the two nations.

==Friendship with George Santayana==
W. Cameron Forbes was a life-long friend of George Santayana, who was a young professor at Harvard during Forbes&#x27;s last three undergraduate years there. Forbes was one of the models for the protagonist Oliver Arden in Santayana&#x27;s novel &quot;The Last Puritan&quot;.

==Later years==
Forbes received an LL.D. from Bates College in 1932. He was on the Board of Trustees, Carnegie Institution of Washington and a Life Member of the Corporation, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was on the original standing committee of the Foundation for the Study of Cycles from 1941. He died unmarried in 1959.

His seasonal home Birdwood, a mansion built in the 1930s for him in southern Georgia, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="671276" wikidata="Q661520" url="?curid=671276" title="Richard Prince">
<text>Richard Prince (born August 6, 1949) is an American painter and photographer. In the mid-1970s, Prince made drawings and painterly collages that he has since disowned. His image &quot;Untitled (Cowboy)&quot;, a photographic reproduction of a photograph by Sam Abell and taken from a cigarette advertisement, was the first rephotograph to be sold for more than $1 million at auction at Christie&#x27;s New York in 2005. He is regarded as &quot;one of the most revered artists of his generation&quot; according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. 
Starting in 1977, Prince photographed four photographs which previously appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. This process of rephotographing continued into 1983, when his work &quot;Spiritual America&quot; featured Garry Gross&#x27;s photo of Brooke Shields at the age of ten, standing in a bathtub, as an allusion to precocious sexuality and to the Alfred Stieglitz photograph by the same name. His &quot;Jokes&quot; series (beginning 1986) concerns the sexual fantasies and sexual frustrations of white, middle-class America, using stand-up comedy and burlesque humor.

After living in New York City for 25 years, Prince moved to upstate New York. His mini-museum, Second House, purchased by the Guggenheim Museum, was struck by lightning and burned down shortly after the museum purchased the House (which Prince had created for himself), having only stood for six years, from 2001 to 2007. In June 2021, the painting &quot;Runaway Nurse&quot; from 2005 to 2006 fetched a record-breaking 93,986,000 HKD (US$12,121,000) at Sotheby&#x27;s in Hong Kong. Prince now lives and works in New York City.

== Early life ==
Richard Prince was born on the 6th of August 1949, in the U.S.-controlled Panama Canal Zone, now part of the Republic of Panama. During an interview in 2000 with Julie L. Belcove, he responded to the question of why his parents were in the Zone, by saying &quot;they worked for the government.&quot; When asked further if his father was involved in the military, Prince responded, &quot;No, he just worked for the government.&quot; &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; later reported that Prince&#x27;s parents worked for the Office of Strategic Services in the Panama Canal before he was born. Prince later lived in the New England city of Braintree, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston, and Provincetown on Cape Cod. In 1973, he moved to New York and joined publishing company &quot;Time Inc.&quot; His job at the &quot;Time Inc.&quot; library involved providing the company&#x27;s various magazines with tear sheets of articles.

== Career ==
Prince was first interested in the art of the American abstract expressionist Jackson Pollock. &quot;I was very attracted to the idea of someone who was by themselves, fairly antisocial, kind of a loner, someone who was noncollaborative.&quot; Prince grew up during the height of Pollock&#x27;s career, making his work accessible. The 1956 &quot;Time&quot; magazine article dubbing Pollock &quot;Jack the Dripper&quot; made the thought of pursuing art as career possible. After finishing high school in 1967, Prince set off for Europe at age 18.

He returned home and attended Nasson College in Maine, which he described as without grades or structure. From Maine he moved to Braintree, Massachusetts, and for a brief time lived in Provincetown. Ultimately he was drawn to New York City. Prince has said that his attraction to New York was instigated by the famous photograph of Franz Kline gazing out the window of his 14th Street studio. Prince described the picture as &quot;a man content to be alone, pursuing the outside world from the sanctum of his studio.&quot;

Prince&#x27;s first solo exhibition took place in June 1980 during a residency at the CEPA gallery in Buffalo, New York. His short book &quot;Menthol Wars&quot; was published as part of the residency. In 1981 Prince had his first West Coast solo exhibition at Jancar Kuhlenschmidt Gallery in Los Angeles. In 1985, he spent four months making art in a rented house in Venice, Los Angeles.

In late 2007, Prince had a retrospective at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, a comprehensive show hung in chronological order along the upward spiraling walls. The show continued onto the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. Maria Morris Hamburg, the curator of photography at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art, asserted, &quot;He is absolutely essential to what&#x27;s going on today, he figured out before anyone else—and in a very precocious manner—how thoroughly pervasive the media is. It&#x27;s not just an aspect of our lives, but the dominant aspect of our lives.&quot;

Prince has built up a large collection of Beat books and papers. Prince owns several copies of &quot;On the Road&quot; by Jack Kerouac, including one inscribed to Kerouac&#x27;s mother, one famously read on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;, the original proof copy of the book and an original galley, as well as the copy owned by Neal Cassady (the Dean Moriarty character in the book), with Cassady&#x27;s signature and marginal notes.

Describing his career and methodology in a 2005 &quot;New York&quot; magazine interview, Prince said, &quot;It&#x27;s about knocking about in the studio and bumping into things.&quot;

=== Rephotography ===
Re-photography uses appropriation as its own focus: artists pull from the works of others and the worlds they depict to create their own work. Appropriation art became popular in the late 1970s. Other appropriation artists such as, Sherrie Levine, Louise Lawler, Vikky Alexander, Cindy Sherman, Barbara Kruger and Mike Bidlo also became prominent in the East Village in the 1980s. This grouping of artists became known as the &quot;Pictures Generation.&quot; All of these artists were greatly influenced by the work of John Baldessari and Robert Heinecken, both of whom have worked extensively with found or readymade print photography since the 1960s, Baldessari working mainly with Hollywood film stills and Heineken mainly with magazine advertisements and print pornography. Both artists taught at UCLA and the California Institute for the Arts in Southern California throughout the 1970s, when many of these artists attended school there.

During the early period of his career, Prince worked in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s tear sheets department. At the end of each work day, he would be left with nothing but the torn out advertising images from the eight or so magazines owned by Time-Life. On the topic of found photographs, Prince said, &quot;Oceans without surfers, cowboys without Marlboros…Even though I’m aware of the classicism of the images. I seem to go after images that I don’t quite believe. And, I try to re-present them even more unbelievably.&quot;

Prince had very little experience with photography, but he has said in interviews that all he needed was a subject, the medium would follow, whether it be paint and brush or camera and film. He compared his new method of searching out interesting advertisements to &quot;beachcombing.&quot; His first series during this time focused on models, living room furniture, watches, pens, and jewellery. Pop culture became the focus of his work. Prince described his experience of appropriation thus: &quot;At first it was pretty reckless. Plagiarizing someone else’s photograph, making a new picture effortlessly. Making the exposure, looking through the lens and clicking, felt like an unwelling . . . a whole new history without the old one. It absolutely destroyed any associations I had experienced with putting things together. And of course the whole thing about the naturalness of the film’s ability to appropriate. I always thought it had a lot to do with having a chip on your shoulder.&quot;

== Controversies ==

=== Patrick Cariou copyright infringement suit ===

In December 2008, photographer Patrick Cariou filed suit against Prince, Gagosian Gallery, Lawrence Gagosian and Rizzoli International Publications in Federal district court for copyright infringement in work shown at Prince&#x27;s Canal Zone exhibit at the Gagosian gallery. Prince was charged with wrongfully appropriating 35 photographs made by Cariou. Several of the pieces were barely changed by Prince. Prince also made 28 paintings that included images from Cariou&#x27;s &quot;Yes Rasta&quot; book. The book featured a series of photographs of Rastafarians that Cariou had taken in Jamaica.

On March 18, 2011, US District Judge Deborah A. Batts ruled against Prince, Gagosian Gallery, Inc., and Lawrence Gagosian. The court found that the use by Prince was not fair use (his primary defence), and Cariou&#x27;s issue of liability for copyright infringement was granted in its entirety. The court cited much case law including the &quot;Rogers v. Koons&quot; case of 1992. On April 25, 2013, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed Judge Batts&#x27;s ruling, stating that Prince&#x27;s use of the photographs in 25 works was transformative and thus fair use. Five less transformative works were sent back to the lower court for review. The case was settled in 2014.

=== Appropriation of Emily Ratajkowski&#x27;s Image ===
In 2014, Prince took one of Emily Ratajkowski&#x27;s Instagram posts without her consent and included the image in his &quot;New Portraits&quot; exhibition at the Gagosian Gallery in New York. Seven years later, Ratajkowski took a photograph of herself standing in front of the painting, and created a non-fungible token (NFT) from it. The NFT sold at auction at Christie&#x27;s for $175,000. &quot;I hope to symbolically set a precedent for women and ownership online, one that allows for women to have ongoing authority over their image and to receive rightful compensation for its usage and distribution,&quot; Ratajkowski wrote on Twitter. Ratajkowski describes the event in the popular essay for &quot;The Cut&quot;, titled &quot;Buying Myself Back&quot;. The controversy raises questions about personality rights and who gets to benefit from the use of one&#x27;s image.

=== Eric McNatt and Donald Graham infringement suits ===
In 2016, photographer Donald Graham sued Prince for violating the copyright on his 1998 photograph, &quot;Rastafarian Smoking a Joint&quot; by including the photograph in his &quot;New Portraits&quot; series. In May of 2023, a New York judge ruled that Prince&#x27;s artwork &quot;Untitled (Portrait of Rastajay92)&quot; was not &quot;transformative&quot; enough to shield Prince from litigation, and that Graham&#x27;s copyright infringement case can proceed to trial. Photographer Eric McNatt similarly sued Prince in 2016 for infringing on his copyright to his portrait of Kim Gordon, co-founder of the band Sonic Youth. On January 26 2024, the two linked cases were settled, with damages awarded to Graham and McNatt, but without any admission of infringement by Prince. 

==Works==

===Cowboys===
Prince&#x27;s series known as the Untitled Cowboys, produced from 1980 to 1992, and ongoing, is his most famous group of rephotographs. Taken from Marlboro cigarette advertisements of the Marlboro Man, they represent an idealized figure of American masculinity. The Marlboro Man was the iconic equivalent of later brands like Ralph Lauren, which used the polo pony image to identify and associate its brand. &quot;Every week. I&#x27;d see one and be like, Oh that&#x27;s mine, Thank you,&quot; Prince stated in an interview.

Prince&#x27;s Cowboys displayed men in boots and ten-gallon hats, with horses, lassos, spurs and all the fixings that make up the stereotypical image of a cowboy. They were set in the Western U.S., in arid landscapes with stone outcrops flanked by cacti and tumbleweeds, with backdrops of sunsets. The advertisements were staged with the utmost attention to detail.

Prince&#x27;s rephotographs of the Marlboro Man advertisements attempt to question how original and realistic the commercial depiction of a &quot;macho man on the horse&quot; is. Prince described his process in a 2003 interview by Steve Lafreiniere in &quot;Artforum&quot;: &quot;I had limited technical skills regarding the camera. Actually I had no skills. I played the camera. I used a cheap commercial lab to blow up the pictures. I made editions of two. I never went into a darkroom.&quot;

While Prince re-contextualizes images by others to redefine them, he has also failed to acknowledge those preceding photographers whose work he appropriates. For the &quot;Untitled (Cowboy)&quot; Series, this includes Norm Clasen and a handful of others. Clasen has expressed being aggrieved over the failure to attribute his work saying: &quot;If you see somebody&#x27;s copied your work, there&#x27;s something deep down in you that says &quot;I&#x27;m the author of that.&quot;&#x27;

&quot;Untitled (Cowboy)&quot; has since been credited by Time Magazine as one of the &quot;Top 100 most influential images of all time.&quot;

===Jokes, Gangs, and Hoods===
Prince&#x27;s rephotographs led to his series known as the Gangs, which followed the same technique of appropriating images from magazines as the Cowboys did, but now the subjects moved from advertisements and mass media toward niches in American society.
Prince in this series paid homage to &quot;sex, drugs, and rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll&quot; in American niches, seen through magazines. He depicted the bizarre in subcultures such as the motorcycle-obsessed, hot rod enthusiasts, surfers, and heavy metal music fans. These Gangs are recognized in his series &quot;Girlfriends&quot;, featuring biker girls. A motorcycle magazine he used featured photographs of motorcyclists&#x27; girlfriends, were sprawled on their boyfriends&#x27; bikes. Prince&#x27;s Gangs works are single sheets of white paper covered with a grouping or &quot;ganging&quot; of 9×12, 35 mm photographs. Prince did not intend any distinct relationship between the &quot;ganged&quot; photographs. An example can be seen in such works as his 1984 &quot;Velvet Beach&quot;, twelve Ektacolor-printed photographs of massive waves, clearly from a surf magazine. Another example is his 1986 &quot;Live Free or Die&quot;, gathering nine images of loosely dressed women on motorcycles.

Prince&#x27;s made his first Joke painting circa 1985, in New York, when he was living in the back room of 303 Gallery located on Park Avenue South. The first joke represented was about psychiatrists, a subject he later worked with often. Prince described the discovery of the idea for the &quot;Joke Paintings&quot; beginning when he posted a small 11 × 14 inch handwritten joke on paper. He realized that if he had walked into a gallery and had seen it hanging from the wall, he would have been envious. Prince&#x27;s Jokes come in several forms. His first Jokes were hand written, taken from joke books. His jokes grew into more substantial works as he began to incorporate them with images, often pairing jokes with images that had no relevance with one another, creating an obscure relationship. An example of one of these peculiar combinations can be seen in his 1991 &quot;Good Revolution&quot;, which depicted black and white images of a male torso in boxing shorts set amongst doodles of a kitchen stove. These were set above the text &quot;Do you know what it means to come home at night to a woman that will give you a little love, a little affection, a little tenderness? It means you&#x27;re in the wrong home, that&#x27;s what it means.&quot; Another one of Prince&#x27;s most well-known Joke paintings is an 80s-style red canvas painting he did in 2004 that says, &quot;Two psychiatrists, one says to the other: I was having lunch with my mother the other day and I made a Freudian slip. I meant to say, &#x27;Please pass the butter,&#x27; and instead it came out, &#x27;You fucking bitch, you ruined my life.&#x27;&quot;

In the late 1980s, Prince, like his contemporaries Lorna Simpson and Barbara Kruger, as well as many of his Conceptual Art precursors, played with image and text in a strategy that was becoming increasingly popular. Prince put jokes among cartoons, often from &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Prince described his early discovery of jokes and his sense of humor, as &quot;I never really started telling, I started telling them over. Back in 1985, in Venice, California, I was drawing my favorite cartoons in pencil on paper. After this I dropped the illustration or image part of the cartoon and concentrated on the punch line.&quot; Prince&#x27;s jokes were primarily satirical one-liners, poking fun at topics such as religion, the relationship between husband and wife, his relations with women. The jokes are simple, often relying on a punch line: &quot;I took my wife to a wife-swapping party, I had to throw in some cash&quot; or &quot;I never had a penny to my name, so I changed my name.&quot;

Jokes became the complete subject of his prints, set atop monochromatic backgrounds red, orange, blue, yellow, etc. These works range in size from 56 × 48 inches as seen in his 1994 &quot;Untitled&quot;, to 112 × 203.5 inches, as seen in his 2000 work &quot;Nuts&quot;. His early jokes were modestly sized, but as they caught on he executed larger pieces. These Monochromatic Jokes question the importance of the unique, in high art. What is it that set these jokes apart from one another, the background color, the color of the text, the jokes themselves? Compared to other Appropriation Artists working in the same time period, Prince has a distinct quality between works and series. Works are distinguishable from one another or identifiable as a particular artist, but with Prince&#x27;s Monochromatic Jokes, we are presented with yellow text upon a blue background as in his 1989 &quot;Are You Kidding?&quot; Differing from Jeff Koons, for example, are not only technique and style, but also the significance given to making the artwork identifiable. In 1988 Koons was working with porcelain sculptures like his Michael Jackson and Bubbles and Pink Panther. These are two works produced in this year that are distinguishable. In the same year, 1988, are Prince&#x27;s &quot;Fireman and the Drunk&quot; and his &quot;Untitled (Joke)&quot;, which raise the serious question of what sets these two works apart. In a 2000 interview with Julie L. Belcove, Prince called the joke paintings &quot;what I wanted to become known for.&quot; When asked to identify the artistic genre of his Jokes, Prince responded, &quot;the Joke paintings are abstract. Especially in Europe, if you can&#x27;t speak English.&quot;

While developing his Gang photographs and Joke paintings Prince was also making sculptural facsimiles of muscle car hoods that merged muscle car culture as a particularly American state of mind. Prince ordered classic vehicle car hoods from within custom car restoration networks and then used the hoods to cast Fiberglas molds which he washed in different colors.

=== Celebrities ===
Celebrities is a series that plays with the American obsession with movie stars. Following Warhol&#x27;s lead, Prince would search out actors&#x27; headshots, promotional photographs which frequently lack copyright protection. Prince signed them himself, using the actor&#x27;s name.

=== Check Paintings ===
The Check Paintings series is like the Celebrities. It was made possible by Prince&#x27;s own interest in collecting. Prince began to seek out canceled checks from famous figures in history ranging from Jack Kerouac to Andy Warhol. He put these checks onto paint-covered canvases and often paired them with images of the individual they once belonged to.

=== Nurse Paintings ===
The Nurse Paintings are a series inspired by the covers and titles of inexpensive novels that were commonly sold at newspaper stands and delis (pulp romance novels). Prince scanned the covers of the books on his computer and used inkjet printing to transfer the images to canvas, and then personalized the pieces with acrylic paint. They debuted in 2003 at Barbara Gladstone Galleries, who along with Larry Gagosian, represents Prince. They received mixed responses, not all selling at the asking prices of $50,000 to $60,000. Titles include &quot;Surfer Nurse&quot;, &quot;Naughty Nurse&quot;, &quot;Millionaire Nurse&quot;, and &quot;Dude Ranch Nurse&quot;, the books from which they were copied. Prince said, &quot;The problem with art is, it&#x27;s not like the game of golf, where you put the ball in the hole or you don&#x27;t put the ball in the hole. There&#x27;s no umpire. There&#x27;s no judge. There are no rules. It&#x27;s one of the problems, but it&#x27;s also one of the great things about art: it becomes a question of what lasts.&quot; The Sonic Youth album Sonic Nurse used Nurse paintings, and included a song called &quot;Dude Ranch Nurse&quot;. 

In the series of paintings, the nurses all wear caps and their mouths are covered by surgical masks, although in some of the paintings the red lips bleed through the masks. The final presentations preserve the title and nurse image from each of the book covers, though almost all else is obscured. Titles include &quot;A Nurse Involved&quot;, &quot;Aloha Nurse&quot;, &quot;Bachelor Nurse&quot;, &quot;Danger Nurse at Work&quot;, &quot;Debutant Nurse&quot;, and &quot;Doctor&#x27;s Nurse.&quot;

Prince&#x27;s &quot;Nurse&quot; paintings have become by far his most expensive series, accounting for his 17 biggest results at auction as of September 2021.

===Later works===
Prince&#x27;s series of paintings from 2007 on appear to be a throwback to more traditional genres of figurative art, and a departure from the pulpy and kitschy content of the Nurse and Jokes series. They are pornographic ink-jet prints overlaid with acrylic paint in a style trying to imitate Willem de Kooning. Prince makes the most direct treatment to the faces, hands and feet, which are bulged and distorted. These works lack the obvious linguistic re-contextualizing of the Jokes series, opting instead for a purely visual idiom.

In 2007, Prince collaborated with the fashion designer Marc Jacobs on his Spring 2008 collection for the French label Louis Vuitton.
An untitled work consists of the body of a 1970 Dodge Challenger and high-performance parts such as a 660 hp Hemi engine, custom interior, black wheel wells, 14-inch tires in the front and 16 inch in the back, a pale orange paint job with a flat black T/A hood, as well as various decals and emblems. Another car sculpture, called &quot;American Prayer&quot;, is a 1968 Dodge Charger that has been completely emptied of any engine parts and interiors and is stripped of any paint and then powder coated. In place of the engine block there is a cement block.

In &quot;Untitled (Covering Pollock)&quot;, a series of 27 works made between 2009 and 2011, Prince printed black-and-white photos of Jackson Pollock taken by Hans Namuth on canvas and pasted grids of photographs showing Sid Vicious, Kate Moss, Stephanie Seymour and pornographic imagery on top. Prince adds his own Pollock-style gestures in paint around the grids.

In 2014, Prince continued his appropriation theme with an exhibit of 38 portraits at the Gagosian gallery in New York City, entitled &quot;New Portraits.&quot; Each image was taken from his Instagram feed and included topless images of models, artists, and celebrities. Underneath the images, Prince provided comments like, &quot;Don&#x27;t du anything. Just B Urself © ®&quot;, with the copyright and registered trademark symbols likely being references to his interests in authorship. &quot;Possible cogent responses to the show include naughty delight and sheer abhorrence&quot;, wrote art critic Peter Schjeldahl in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. &quot;My own was something like a wish to be dead.&quot; As with similar Prince works, the Instagram prints draw attention to the intersection of art and copyright infringement. Some of the unwilling subjects of his art, notably members of SuicideGirls, have started selling their own derivative works based on Prince derivative works of their original works.

In 2015, Prince would repeat his exhibit from Gagosian with a new exhibit for the Frieze Art Fair in NYC. However, Prince would end up making headlines due to selling the portraits for profit—at the fair, Prince sold enlargements of his Instagram feed and comments for $90,000.

In 2017, he generated controversy by returning a $36,000 payment he had received in 2014 for his portrayal of Ivanka Trump, claiming that he could not live with the idea of one of his works being in the collection of the Trump family.

==Museum exhibitions==
Prince has been the subject of major survey exhibitions, including the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (1992); San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (1993); Museum Boijmans van Beuningen, Rotterdam (1993); Museum für Gegenwartskunst, Basel (2001, traveled to Kunsthalle Zürich and Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg); Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (2007, traveled to the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, 2008); and Serpentine Gallery, London (2008). &quot;Richard Prince: American Prayer,&quot; an exhibition of American literature and ephemera from the artist&#x27;s collection, was on view at the Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris in 2011. Prince&#x27;s work has also appeared numerous group exhibitions, including in Bienal de São Paulo (1983), Whitney Biennial (1985, 1987, 1997, and 2004), Biennale of Sydney (1986), Venice Biennale (1988 and 2007), and documenta 9 (1992).

<text>George Curtis (April 9, 1925 – May 13, 2004) was a professional boxer, referee and business owner who was licensed to officiate bouts in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Curtis, who had an undistinguished career as a boxer, lived in Las Vegas for thirty years. There, he established the Curtis Construction Company, which he owned until May 2003.

As a boxing referee, Curtis was known for taking boxer&#x27;s safety into consideration first. He refereed a number of world title fights, and he worked a number of non-title fights over the years.

Curtis is best remembered, however, for two specific fights: On June 26, 1981, at Las Vegas, Lupe Pintor was defending his WBC world Bantamweight championship against Jovito Rengifo, who was attempting to become Peru&#x27;s first world boxing champion. Rengifo was leading on all scorecards going into the seventh round, but he absorbed dangerous punches during the course of that round. Curtis stopped the fight, giving Pintor a seventh round technical knockout win. The fight&#x27;s crowd, which in Las Vegas is filled usually with pro-Mexican fans, booed Curtis for his decision to stop the fight.

On December 10, 1982, he was chosen to referee the WBA world Heavyweight championship bout between champion Mike Weaver and challenger Michael Dokes. Dokes had Weaver against the ropes and was landing a combination when Curtis stepped in and stopped the fight. Weaver had already suffered a knockdown about twenty seconds before, but many fans and critics felt that Curtis acted too quickly by stopping the bout after only 63 seconds of fighting. Neither a standing eight count nor a three knockdown rule was in effect.

The WBA investigated the fight, and during the investigation, it was revealed that Curtis had been told by the Nevada Athletic Commission to be mindful of the condition of the fighters after the November 18 death of Duk Koo Kim as the result of a fight with Ray Mancini in Las Vegas on November 13. Fearful of another tragedy, Curtis stopped the fight to prevent Weaver from further punishment. On May 20, 1983, Dokes and Weaver held a rematch, with Dokes retaining the title with a fifteen-round draw.

In his testimony at a Senate hearing in 1993 on organized crime’s involvement in professional boxing, Gambino crime family underboss Sammy Gravano stated that Curtis offered to improve a boxer’s WBC ranking in exchange for $10,000.

In June 2003, Curtis sold his company to a contractor whose license was revoked a month earlier for signing contracts and not finishing work, which resulted in complaints with the state board. Joey Curtis died after a sudden illness at Saint Rose Hospital in Las Vegas.

<doc id="671281" wikidata="Q467940" url="?curid=671281" title="Charly García">
<text>Carlos Alberto García Moreno (born October 23, 1951), better known by his stage name Charly García, is an Argentine singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, composer and record producer, considered one of the most important rock musicians Argentine and Latin American music. Named &quot;the father of rock nacional&quot;, García is widely acclaimed for his recording work, both in his multiple groups and as a soloist, and for the complexity of his music compositions, covering genres like folk rock, progressive rock, symphonic rock, jazz, new wave, pop rock, funk rock, and synth-pop. His lyrics are known for being transgressive and critical towards modern Argentine society, especially during the era of the military dictatorship, and for his rebellious and extravagant personality, which has drawn significant media attention over the years.

In his teenage years, García founded the folk-rock band Sui Generis with his classmate Nito Mestre in the early 70s. Together, they released three successful studio albums which captured the spirit of a whole generation producing a string widely sung anthems that became a staple of campfires and part of the Argentinian cultural landscape. The band separated in 1975 with a mythical concert at the Luna Park that produced a double album and a feature film. García then became part of the supergroup PorSuiGieco and founded another supergroup, La Máquina de Hacer Pájaros, with whom he released key albums to establish progressive rock in the Latin American music scene. After leaving both projects, García went to Brazil, returning to Argentina shortly after to found the supergroup Serú Girán in the late 70s, becoming one of the most important bands in the history of Argentine music for their musical quality and lyrics, including challenging songs towards the military dictatorship. The group dissolved in 1982 after releasing four studio albums and a final concert at the Obras Sanitarias stadium.

Following the composition of the soundtrack for the film &quot;Pubis Angelical&quot;, and his album, &quot;Yendo de la cama al living&quot; (1982), García embarked on a prolific solo career, composing several generational songs of Latin music and pushing the boundaries of pop music. His successful trilogy was completed with the new wave albums &quot;Clics modernos&quot; (1983) and &quot;Piano bar&quot; (1984), ranked among the best albums in the history of Argentine rock by Liam Young. In the subsequent years, García worked on the projects &quot;Tango&quot; and &quot;Tango 4&quot; with Pedro Aznar and released a second successful trilogy with &quot;Parte de la religión&quot; (1987), &quot;Cómo conseguir chicas&quot; (1989), and &quot;Filosofía barata y zapatos de goma&quot; (1990). Simultaneously, he began to be involved in various media scandals due to his exorbitant and extravagant behavior, and he suffered his first health accident due to increasing drug addiction during the 90s. By the end of the 90s and the beginning of the 2000s, García entered his controversial and chaotic &quot;Say no More&quot; era, in which critics and sales poorly received his albums, but his concerts were a success. After the release of &quot;Rock and Roll YO&quot; (2003), he took a long hiatus, with sporadic appearances for rehabilitation from his addiction issues. He returned to the public scene with his latest live album &quot;El concierto subacuático&quot; (2010) and released the albums &quot;Kill Gil&quot; (2010) and &quot;Random&quot; (2017).

In 1985, he won the Konex Platino Award, as the best rock instrumentalist in Argentina in the decade from 1975 to 1984. In 2009, he received the Grammy Award for Musical Excellence. He won the Gardel de Oro Award three times (2002, 2003, and 2018). In 2010, he was declared an Illustrious Citizen of Buenos Aires by the Legislature of the City of Buenos Aires, and in 2013, he received the title of Doctor Honoris Causa from the National University of General San Martín.

== Biography ==

===Early years===
Carlos Alberto García was born in the city of Buenos Aires on October 23, 1951, into an upper-middle-class family. He was the firstborn of Carmen Moreno and Carlos Jaime García Lange, an entrepreneur who owned the first Formica factory in Argentina. The family included three brothers: Enrique, Daniel, and Josi. His mother was dedicated to the care and education of her children, with the help of professional nannies. The family home was a large apartment located on the fifth floor of José María Moreno Street 63, in the heart of the Caballito neighborhood, and ten blocks from Parque Centenario, where Charly often went to draw dinosaurs at the Argentine Museum of Natural Sciences. Dinosaurs, planets, and Greek myths were the three topics that fascinated Charly as a child. The family also had a weekend country house in Paso del Rey.

In 1958, he began his primary education at the public school No. 3, &quot;Primera Junta,&quot; located two blocks from his home. In 1959, the family&#x27;s economic situation went into crisis when the factory closed, leading to the subsequent loss of most of the family&#x27;s properties, including the house on José María Moreno Street and the country house in Paso del Rey. The García family then had to move to a rented apartment located in Darregueyra and Paraguay, in the then neighborhood of Palermo Viejo.

His father began working as a physics and mathematics teacher, and his mother started working as a producer of radio and later television programs dedicated to tango and Argentine folklore, which was experiencing what came to be known as &quot;the folklore boom.&quot; Due to her work, it became common for the mother to invite prominent folklore musicians to their home, where &quot;Carlitos&quot; would play the piano. The family&#x27;s economic situation improved, and they moved to an apartment located in where the musician lived until 1972 when he moved in with his future partner María Rosa Yorio to a nearby boarding house. The photos included in the album &quot;Vida&quot; were taken nearby. As both parents had to go out to work, García was sent to finish primary school at the Argentine Aeronautical School, located on Quilmes Street in the Pompeya neighborhood, due to its double schooling system.

Music began very early in García&#x27;s life: at two years old, he learned to play a zither by ear and later continued with a small toy piano that his maternal grandmother gave him. When García&#x27;s parents went on a trip to Europe, the children were left under the care of nannies and a grandmother. The stress caused by his parents&#x27; absence triggered a nervous crisis in Charly, a disorder that caused his characteristic vitiligo. When his parents returned from the trip, his mother noticed that Charly had learned to play &quot;Torna a Surriento,&quot; a famous Neapolitan melody that was in a family music box, by ear. Charly has mentioned that he believes the solo of &quot;Seminare&quot; was derived from that melody.

Recognizing &quot;Carlitos&#x27;&quot; innate talent and absolute pitch, his parents enrolled him in 1956 in the Thibaud Piazzini Conservatory. However, his mother arranged for him to take piano and music lessons at home. His teacher was Julieta Sandoval, whom Charly describes as a very strict, &quot;super Catholic&quot; teacher who believed in suffering and pain as necessary to become a good classical concert pianist:
His first public performance was on October 6, 1956, at just four years old, at the Conservatory, presented in the program as &quot;Carlitos Alberto García Moreno.&quot; He performed two classical pieces, one anonymous and the other written by his teacher.

As a child, Charly loved classical music and despised popular music, just like his parents. He barely slept – feeling that doing so was a waste of time – and spent whole days playing works by Chopin and Mozart. However, he also felt the urge to compose, something his teacher systematically repressed. At the age of 9, in 1960, he composed his first piece, &quot;Corazón de hormigón&quot; (included in &quot;Kill Gil&quot;), but he did not reveal it due to fear of his teacher&#x27;s reaction. In 2004, García paid tribute to his childhood piano teacher by unexpectedly appearing at the centenary celebration of the Thibaud Piazzini Conservatory to perform two of his own compositions from the Serú Girán era, &quot;Desarma y sangra&quot; and &quot;Veinte trajes verdes,&quot; the latter dedicated to the composer Erik Satie.

In 1962, a musical television program called &quot;El Club del Clan&quot; aired in Buenos Aires, gaining a large youth audience due to the presence of very young singers like Palito Ortega, who performed original songs of the so-called &quot;new wave&quot; (rock and roll, twist, and beat music) in Spanish. At this time, García began to break away from the classical piano concert career that his family&#x27;s education was imposing on him. While watching the program and after arguing with his mother, he composed his first song, “Corazón de hormigón,” attributing his mother&#x27;s hardness of heart to the song. In 2010, nearly fifty years later, García recorded the song with Palito Ortega and included it in the album &quot;Kill Gil&quot;. In his later songbook, he revisited the theme of &quot;the new wave&quot; in &quot;Mientras miro las nuevas olas.&quot;

In 1963, at the age of twelve, he received a diploma as a teacher of theory and solfeggio, but the following year, in 1964, García, like tens of thousands of young Argentines, heard The Beatles for the first time, which caused a radical change in his life:

With The Beatles came other influential artists such as The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, The Byrds, and The Who. This marked the end of his classical music career. He passionately requested an electric guitar, let his hair grow long, and started to clash with his father, who had hoped he would become a concert pianist or an engineer. This relationship never fully recovered; although they were no longer struggling financially, his father started insisting that he get a job to finance his &quot;vices.&quot; However, his relationship with his mother was different:

Among the anecdotes from his childhood as a prodigy, Sergio Marchi recounts that, in the mid-1960s, Mercedes Sosa went to dinner at García Moreno&#x27;s house. Upon hearing Carlitos play the piano, she commented to Ariel Ramírez: &quot;This kid is like Chopin.&quot; Another story tells of a show by Eduardo Falú organized by his mother, where he pointed out to the folk musician that his guitar&#x27;s fifth string was out of tune, something no one else had noticed.

In 1965, Charly began his secondary education at the Instituto Social Militar Dr. Dámaso Centeno, a nearby school in his birth neighborhood, attended by military family members. This was a time when the Armed Forces had overthrown the constitutional government of Juan D. Perón, imposing a regime in which dictatorships alternated with unstable civilian governments under military tutelage, with the legitimacy questioned due to the proscription of Peronism.

García had a Winco record player in his room where he listened to rock records he exchanged at the Centro Cultural del Disco in return for promotional albums his mother received. García recalls that among the records he especially listened to was Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; in 1965, which caused him a paroxysm.

During his time in secondary school, he often skipped classes to play the piano in the auditorium.

Here, he was invited by Alberto &quot;Beto&quot; Rodríguez, the drummer, to form a band. They called it To Walk Spanish, a name given by García that expresses the act of expelling or throwing a person out by grabbing them by the neck of the jacket and the belt. To Walk Spanish consisted of Juan Bellia (guitar), Alejandro &quot;Pipi&quot; Correa (bass), Charly García (guitar), and Alberto &quot;Beto&quot; Rodríguez (drums). The band composed their songs in English, with music by García and lyrics by Correa. They also performed a few covers, including &quot;Feel a Whole Lot Better&quot; by The Byrds, which Charly would later include in the album &quot;Filosofía barata y Zapatos de goma&quot; under the title &quot;Me siento mucho mejor,&quot; with changed lyrics (&quot;I feel much stronger without your love&quot;), but without altering the meaning.

=== First Period - Music groups ===
====Sui Generis (1972–1975)====

García first met Nito Mestre in high school, also a student at Dámaso Centeno, who was part of the band The Century Indignation, along with Carlos &quot;Piraña&quot; Piegari. In the second half of 1968, both bands merged to form Sui Generis, a name chosen by García to signify not only the musical originality he aspired to but also as a defense of the &#x27;freak,&#x27; the odd, the &#x27;nerd,&#x27; and their path, in the face of derogatory comments they received at the time.

The initial formation was a sextet comprising Charly (vocals, keyboards, and guitar), Nito (vocals and flute), Piegari (guitar), Beto Rodríguez (drums), Juan Bellia (guitar), Alejandro Correa (bass). Later, Correa was replaced by Rolando Fortich, and in 1970, Rodríguez was replaced by Francisco “Paco” Prati. Additionally, Carlos &quot;Lito&quot; Lareu (guitar), Diego Monteverde, Hugo Alfredo Negri (bass), Diego Fraschetti, and Daniel Bernareggi, who played bass on the 1970 album, also participated in the band.

During this period, Charly composed music but initially did not write lyrics, a role filled mainly by Piegari and also by Correa. Charly has mentioned that he and Piegari were &quot;the Lennon and McCartney of the school.&quot;
In 1968, they composed a rock opera in Spanish titled &quot;Teo,&quot; about a son of the Moon and a cat, blending bossa nova with tango and rock. It had 16 different parts in rock, blues, and bossa nova rhythms. Some of the opera&#x27;s themes, such as &quot;Teo,&quot; &quot;Marina,&quot; and &quot;Juana,&quot; later influenced songs like &quot;Eiti Leda&quot; and some riffs from La máquina de hacer pájaros.

Initially, Sui Generis focused on vocal harmonization. Charly, Nito, and Piegari took singing lessons from a teacher who lived opposite Piegari&#x27;s family home in Flores. Charly stated that his model for both To Talk Spanish and Sui Generis was the American band Vanilla Fudge, from whom he took the use of the organ, multi-part musical themes, psychedelia, and symphonic rock in their early stages.

There are four known recordings of Sui Generis from this period, made on two Minisurco acetate discs in 1969 and 1970. The first disc contains &quot;De las brumas regresaré,&quot; composed by Charly García and Alejandro Correa, and &quot;Escuchando al juglar en silencio,&quot; by Correa. The second disc features two songs from the opera &quot;Teo&quot;: &quot;Marina&quot; and &quot;Grita,&quot; both credited to Charly García and Carlos Piegari.

In December 1969, when most of the group members were concluding high school, the sextet Sui Generis was invited to perform at the graduation party in front of hundreds of people, held at the Instituto Santa Rosa (Rosario 638). Adolescence was ending, school was no longer the setting that brought them together, and the young members were starting their adult lives, each following their own paths.

1970 was a year of changes for the band. First, they performed at the Club Italiano in Caballito, which García recalls as the band&#x27;s debut. At the same time, Nito Mestre considers the performance at the Instituto Santa Rosa as their debut.

At that time, Pierre Bayona, a music producer and &#x27;dealer&#x27; in the rock world, was known as &quot;el gordo Pierre&quot; and immortalized by that name in the song &quot;Pierre, el vitricida&quot; by Redonditos de Ricota, discovered Sui Generis when they were still a sextet. Bayona tirelessly insisted in musical production circles about the extraordinary qualities of the group, particularly Charly García.

In the summer of 1971, the band acted as the opening act for Huinca, a group led by Lito Nebbia, at the Teatro Diagonal in Mar del Plata and then at the Teatro de la Comedia, directed by Gregorio Nachman, as the opening act for Pedro y Pablo. However, several members of the group were unable to attend, so Sui Generis had to perform as a duo consisting of Charly García and Nito Mestre. The performance took place on February 5 or 6. &quot;We were very surprised because people started to like our vibe,&quot; says Nito. Two statues of Nito and Charly, located at Rivadavia and Santa Fe, where the theater used to be, commemorate that event, although the concert took place when they were still a band.

Meanwhile, the band continued to visit record labels, but without any success. León Gieco invited them to participate in a concert at the Luz y Fuerza Theater. They met, mutual admiration developed, and from then on Gieco and García became &quot;soul friends.&quot;

The group also started to play frequently at the Teatro ABC, located on Esmeralda Street, near Lavalle, in downtown Buenos Aires, which at the time was a rock hub. They performed on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights to gain recognition. There, the following year, when the band had become a duo, they met María Rosa Yorio, a groupie and singer, who would become Charly&#x27;s partner, a backup singer for Sui Generis, and one of the first female rock singers in Latin America.

At the end of 1971, Charly was drafted by the Army to serve a year of mandatory military service, an institution that was traditional at the time but rejected by a significant part of the youth, including those who had made long hair a symbol of rebellion and change. Young people resorted to various ploys to &quot;escape the draft.&quot; Charly García was no exception. After his hopes of escaping through a &quot;low number&quot; (in the preliminary lottery) were dashed, Charly resorted to all possible tricks: seeking &quot;arrangements&quot; with officials known to his parents (which at least managed to have him sent to the Campo de Mayo regiment, in the Buenos Aires suburbs); simulating physical and mental illnesses and fainting spells; disobeying orders; making life impossible for the soldiers; etc. As a result of these simulations, he was sent to the Central Military Hospital, where, to make his &quot;character&quot; credible, he took a bottle of amphetamines that his mother had brought to the hospital. The overdose caused an extreme state of excitement, making him think he was going to die. In those conditions, he wrote in one go the song that would become his first massive hit just a few months later: &quot;Song for my death.&quot; An additional incident happened more or less simultaneously: Charly had to carry a stretcher with a corpse to the morgue, but instead, he took it to the Officers&#x27; Casino, causing a scandal. The military then sent him home, and a few days later, he was discharged for suffering from &quot;hysterical neurosis, schizoid personality.&quot; Charly detailed this experience in &quot;Botas locas,&quot; which would be included in the album &quot;Pequeñas anécdotas sobre las instituciones&quot;:

It was the summer of 1972: the sextet had been narrowing down. It was about to become a duo consisting of Charly and Nito. However, several of the original members of Sui Generis would continue to maintain some musical contact with Sui Generis or Charly García: Alejandro &quot;Pipi&quot; Correa participated as a bassist and in the albums &quot;Confesiones de invierno&quot; and &quot;Pequeñas anécdotas sobre las instituciones&quot;. He joined Sui Generis in some performances between 1972 and 1974, including the BA Rock III festival in 1972. His song &quot;Gaby&quot; was included in García&#x27;s album &quot;Música del alma&quot; (1980). He continued his career as a professional musician and composer. In 1974, Correa recorded his song &quot;Canción para elegir&quot; with keyboards by Charly García, released on the LP &quot;Rock para mis amigos Vol.4&quot; (1975). Carlos Piegari wrote the lyrics for several songs later performed by some of Charly García&#x27;s bands, such as &quot;Natalio Ruiz&quot;, (&quot;Vida&quot;, 1973); &quot;Tu alma te mira hoy&quot; (&quot;PorSuiGieco&quot;, 1976), &quot;Monoblock&quot; (&quot;Sinfonías para adolescentes&quot;, 2000). He also composed the song &quot;Gaby,&quot; with music by Alejandro Correa, included in the album &quot;Música del alma&quot; (1980). He continued his career as a musician and professional writer. Francisco “Paco” Prati remained as the drummer for Sui Generis, even when Charly and Nito were contracted to record the first album. He participated in the Sui Generis albums, &quot;Vida&quot; and &quot;Confesiones de invierno&quot;, and in performances until the end of 1973, including the BA Rock III festival of 1972. Later, he joined the band Nito Mestre y Los Desconocidos de Siempre. He graduated as an architect and dedicated himself to his profession without abandoning music, focusing on jazz. By the end of 1971, the young Argentine rock movement was going through a generational change, as Almendra, Los Gatos, and Manal (its three foundational groups) had just disbanded, and their former members were attempting to create new formations: Spinetta was founding Pescado Rabioso; Pappo was starting to rehearse with Pappo&#x27;s Blues and Billy Bond. After leaving the military, Charly met María Rosa Yorio at ABC in 1972. They started dating clandestinely because the musician had his official girlfriend named Maggie, who worked in the musical &quot;Hair&quot;, an emblematic work of the &quot;hippie&quot; movement. But one day María Rosa got tired and told him to choose between her or Maggie. He chose her. Due to the conflictive relationship they both had with their families, they soon moved to a boarding house in Aráoz and Soler (Palermo) and later to a slightly better one in the San Telmo neighborhood. Neither of them had a good income, so those were difficult times. Charly even had to sell his amplifier to pay for the pension. This moment is reflected in songs like &quot;Confesiones de invierno&quot; (&quot;She kicked me out of her room, shouting: &#x27;You have no profession&#x27;&quot;), &quot;Quizás porque&quot; (&quot;Perhaps because I am none of that is why you are here in my bed&quot;), and &quot;Cuando comenzamos a nacer&quot; (&quot;And you discover that love is more than one night and together we watch the sunrise&quot;). Yorio, for her part, would be the recipient of a large number of Charly&#x27;s songs, such as &quot;Rasguña las piedras&quot;, &quot;Necesito&quot;, &quot;Seminare&quot;, &quot;Bubulina&quot;, &quot;Dime quién me lo robó&quot;, &quot;Pequeñas delicias de la vida conyugal&quot; and &quot;Antes de gira (tema para María)&quot;. The book &quot;Quien es la chica&quot; by Larrea and Balmaceda dedicates nineteen pages to Charly García&#x27;s songs related to María Rosa Yorio.

By mid-1972, after trying all the record companies and suffering the miseries of the music industry, Pierre Bayona&#x27;s persistent efforts to get an opportunity for the duo finally paid off. Billy Bond and Jorge Álvarez (founder of the legendary label Mandioca), agreed to an audition. Both were satisfied, even though the adolescent lyrics and acoustic sound did not completely convince them, but Charly&#x27;s performance and his mastery of the piano overcame any reservations they might have had. They agreed to record a single, with the song &quot;Song for my death&quot;, which amazed them, and an album. The good performance of the duo allowed Bayona to get Charly contracted to accompany Raúl Porchetto on keyboards on his debut album, &quot;Cristo Rock&quot;, which in turn convinced Billy Bond to hire him to join his band, Billy Bond y La Pesada del Rock and Roll, on a national tour.

Finally, in February 1973, Sui Generis released their first album, &quot;Vida&quot;, under the Talent Microfón label and produced by Jorge Álvarez. Álvarez was not convinced of the value of recording the album, and it was Billy Bond who decisively influenced the decision, recording it in an almost secretive manner. The duo was accompanied by former Manal members, Claudio Gabis (electric guitar and harmonica) and Alejandro Medina (bass), Carlos &quot;Lito&quot; Lareu (guitar), Jorge Pinchevsky (violin), and Francisco Prati (drums), who came from the pre-duo Sui Generis band. Among the main songs are &quot;Canción para mi muerte&quot; (also released as a single), &quot;Dime quién me lo robó&quot; (about his religious crisis), &quot;Necesito&quot;, &quot;Quizás porque&quot;, &quot;Natalio Ruiz&quot; (lyrics by Carlos Piegari), &quot;Mariel y el capitán&quot;, &quot;Estación&quot;, and &quot;Cuando comenzamos a nacer&quot;. A series of songs that would remain in the popular songbook for decades, especially &quot;Canción para mi muerte&quot;, which was chosen by the Argentine edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine and the MTV network as song #11 among the .

The biographer of Charly García, Sergio Marchi, narrates the impact of the album&#x27;s release in this way:

Fito Páez, who was 9 years old at the time, reflects thus:

At the same time, some historical rockers criticized these two disheveled-looking adolescents as &quot;soft&quot;. Pappo said that Sui Géneris &quot;softened the milanesa&quot;. Spinetta also declared that he did not like Sui Generis because he found their themes childish (he likened them to the songs of María Elena Walsh).

Argentina was at that time experiencing the moments before a brief reconquest of democracy without proscriptions, with the March 1973 elections, in a context of almost three decades of dictatorships. This generation has been known as &quot;the seventies generation,&quot; characterized by strong youthful idealism, with flags like &quot;liberation&quot;, Che Guevara, political militancy, and the sexual revolution. Long hair for men was a generational flag. At that time, Charly had no defined political commitment, beyond a strong rebellion against the hypocrisy of &quot;adults&quot;, social prejudices, or the rigidity of the educational system, but this was not the case for María Rosa Yorio or Jorge Álvarez, who had a clearly left-wing stance, including sympathy for the revolutionary currents of Peronism.

Musically, since 1967, an original current of &quot;national rock&quot;, as it was called at the time, had been developing mainly in Buenos Aires, with lyrics in Spanish, and having as its greatest exponents until that moment Los Gatos led by Lito Nebbia, Manal (Medina-Gabis-Martínez), and Almendra, led by Luis Alberto Spinetta, not to mention the importance of other decisive bands like Vox Dei and their historic opera La Biblia, Arco Iris, led by Gustavo Santaolalla, and the &quot;blues&quot; line headed by Pappo. Sui Generis began to establish itself at the same level, and Charly García started to rise as a leading figure of the movement, alongside Spinetta.

On December 16, 1972, Sui Generis performed as a trio (Charly, Nito, and &quot;Paco&quot; Prati) at the third edition of the BA Rock Festival of 1972 (B.A. Rock III), held at the Campo Las Malvinas of the Argentinos Juniors club. They performed &quot;Canción para mi muerte&quot;. It was the first time they played for a massive audience. The trio&#x27;s performance was filmed and included in the movie &quot;Rock hasta que se ponga el sol&quot;, directed by Aníbal Uset, premiered on February 8, 1973.

Between November 1972 and April 1973, Sui Generis became Argentina&#x27;s most popular rock band, especially among the younger crowd and particularly among women. In February 1973, the film &quot;Hasta que se ponga el sol&quot; was released and simultaneously the live version of &quot;Canción para mi muerte&quot; recorded in the film was launched as a single. In March, they gave a concert at the Lasalle College (of which there is a recorded version) and in April, Sui Generis surprised everyone with a massive turnout of teenagers at their first solo concert at the Astral Theatre, one of the most important in Buenos Aires, located on Avenida Corrientes. An article of the time, from the magazine Pelo, highlights the presence of &quot;girls who are not the usual ones at concerts, who had come in groups of four or five&quot;, drawn by songs in which &quot;true love, tenderness as a genuine gesture of giving&quot; were intertwined. The overwhelming success of &quot;Canción para mi muerte&quot; at that time generated a sort of thematic and musical misunderstanding, which tended to pigeonhole the duo outside of rock, within the romantic pop genre. Nito Mestre recognized this situation in a 1973 interview:

In October 1973, Sui Generis released their second album: &quot;Confesiones de invierno&quot;. The intention of the album was to make it clear to their audience that Sui Generis was a rock band and to correct any misunderstanding about the band&#x27;s profile. &quot;We don&#x27;t want to disappoint the audience,&quot; Charly summed up when explaining what the album was about at that time.

This was a much more polished album than the first one, which had to be recorded &quot;on the sly&quot; when the label did not believe Sui Generis could be successful. &quot;It was a much more polished album,&quot; says Mestre. That year both musicians had grown, gained experience, and adopted a more professional demeanor. The album was recorded on eight tracks at the RCA studios. They hired Eduardo Zvetelman to arrange the orchestra and Juan José Mosalini (1943–2022) to play the bandoneón in &quot;Cuando ya me empiece a quedar solo.&quot;

The album&#x27;s title carries the name of the song of the same title, an intimate theme that Charly asked Nito to perform alone, reflecting the fears and sacrifices involved in launching into the life of an artist, against his family&#x27;s opinion:

Like in &quot;Vida&quot;, the album again is composed of songs that almost entirely entered the popular songbook. Foremost among them is &quot;Rasguña las piedras&quot;, a heartrending cry for freedom that the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine and MTV network considered as the third . It is accompanied by other classic songs from Charly García&#x27;s songbook, such as &quot;Cuando ya me empiece a quedar solo&quot;, &quot;Bienvenidos al tren&quot;, &quot;Lunes otra vez&quot;, &quot;Aprendizaje&quot;, and &quot;Tribulaciones, lamentos y ocaso de un tonto rey imaginario, o no

The album achieved exceptional sales and reaffirmed that Sui Generis&#x27; explosive popularity over the past year was not due to a misunderstanding or a one-off hit. The success of the album dispelled Charly&#x27;s fears and insecurities about the real possibility of making a living from music, which he had expressed in the song that gave the album its title.

On July 1, 1974, President Juan D. Perón died, and the country entered a spiral of political violence. The Alianza Anticomunista Argentina (Triple A), financed by the CIA and the Italian lodge Propaganda Due and led by Minister José López Rega, known as &quot;the sorcerer&quot; (Charly would allude to him in &quot;Song of Alice in the country&quot;), launched a campaign of persecution and extermination of militants, artists, and intellectuals labeled as &quot;leftists&quot;. However, influenced by Yorio, Álvarez, and especially by the writer David Viñas, Charly had become politically committed to the ideas of the Revolutionary Communist Party of Argentina, a splinter group from the Communist Party of Argentina that had adopted a Maoist position, which would be noticeable in his themes.

Towards the end of the year, Sui Generis released their third album, &quot;Pequeñas anécdotas sobre las instituciones&quot;. The band had ceased to be a duo and was now a quartet, also including Rinaldo Rafanelli on bass and guitars and Juan Rodríguez on drums.

The album surprised both critics and fans with a symphonic rock style, including innovative electronic instruments for the time and a marked political critique of the basic &quot;institutions&quot; of society: the family, the military, police repression, censorship, political assassinations. García specified that the institutions &quot;were Power, the military, well, those who had appropriated the institutions&quot;. Notable songs include &quot;Instituciones&quot;, &quot;El tuerto y los ciegos&quot;, &quot;Para quien canto yo entonces&quot;, and &quot;Las increíbles aventuras del Sr. Tijeras&quot;.

The original project for the album had a political directness that was moderated at the suggestion of Jorge Álvarez (director of the Talent label), for safety, to avoid putting Sui Generis on the Triple A&#x27;s death threat list. Some lyrics were modified, and two songs were excluded, &quot;Botas locas&quot; and &quot;Juan Represión&quot;. The following year, Sui Generis performed a concert in Uruguay, which was governed by a civic-military dictatorship, with the original songs and lyrics. Charly, Nito, and the rest of the band were illegally detained in Uruguay, beaten, and interrogated by intelligence services, without legal counsel or communication with the Argentine embassy. Twenty years later, when the album was reissued by Microfón in digital format, the two excluded tracks were included as &#x27;bonus tracks&#x27;.

Musically, the album represented a fundamental stylistic shift, more complex, conceptual, and oriented towards r&quot;o&quot;ck sinfónico. In some ways, &quot;Instituciones&quot; marked a return to the original style of Sui Generis, before it became a duo, when they followed the model of Vanilla Fudge. The album also featured backing vocals by María Rosa Yorio and contributions from guest musicians such as Alejandro Correa (bass), Carlos Cutaia (Hammond organ), León Gieco (harmonica), David Lebón, Oscar Moro (drums), Jorge Pinchevsky (violin), and Billy Bond (chorus). On his part, Charly began to play complex keyboards, newly acquired Yamaha Strings, Rhodes piano, mini Moog, clavinet Hohner, mellotron, ARP strings, and string ensemble.

The album was highly praised though it did not sell as expected. The public and producers struggled to understand Charly&#x27;s musical evolution and demanded a return to the acoustic and simple style of the first two albums. Meanwhile, García, Mestre, and the rest of the band had begun using lysergic acid diethylamide. Charly then decided to create a new concept album around psychedelia and thought of a name: &quot;Ha sido&quot;. The band recorded the entire album, but the &#x27;managers&#x27; and producers refused to release it, pressuring the group to return to the initial ballads that had guaranteed commercial success. Reluctantly, they had to settle for releasing an EP, with only one of the new album&#x27;s tracks (&quot;Alto en la torre&quot;) and three tracks from previous albums. The complete content and recordings of the frustrated album &quot;Ha sido&quot; have never been publicly disclosed. It is known that at least it included &quot;Entra eléctrico&quot;, &quot;Nena (Eiti Leda)&quot;, &quot;Bubulina&quot;, &quot;Fabricante de mentiras&quot;, and possibly also &quot;La fuga del paralítico&quot;, an instrumental by Rinaldo Rafanelli. Rafanelli himself commented on this:

Charly&#x27;s frustration at being unable to release the fourth album was decisive in his decision to leave Sui Generis, which essentially meant dissolving the group. The cycle was complete and it was evident to Nito as well. For the fans and the rock world, it was a cold shower. Businessmen screamed and even reproached him for being a &quot;fool&quot; who was &quot;killing the goose that laid the golden eggs&quot;. As a compromise, the company proposed to García to do a farewell concert at Luna Park, the country&#x27;s largest indoor stadium, something that no Argentine rock artist had even dreamed of. The proposal was completed with the idea of filming the concert live and making a movie.

The city was plastered with advertising posters with the legend &quot;Adiós Sui Géneris&quot; over which multitudes of young people full of disbelief and pain wrote &quot;Why are they separating?&quot;. The call exceeded all expectations and it was decided to hold a second concert, immediately after the first. &quot;Adiós Sui Géneris&quot; was a show that gathered more than twenty-five thousand people and set a record audience for national rock that would take a long time to be surpassed. At the concert, several of the &quot;Ha sido&quot; songs were played, such as &quot;Nena (Eiti Leda)&quot;, &quot;Bubulina&quot;, &quot;Fabricante de mentiras&quot;, and &quot;censored&quot; songs like &quot;Botas locas&quot; and &quot;El fantasma de Canterville&quot;. Before the end of the year, Talent released the concert recording, in a double album titled &quot;Adiós Sui Géneris, parte I &amp; parte II&quot;. In 1996, a third part, &quot;Adiós Sui Géneris volumen III&quot;, was released.

Nito Mestre recounts that after the concert, he went to live with Charly and María Rosa, to prepare their next projects:

On March 24, 1976, a coup d&#x27;état installed a civic-military dictatorship in power, imposing a regime of state terrorism that caused thousands of disappearances, murders, kidnappings, torture, rapes, baby thefts, and exiles, with a network of clandestine detention centers and task forces, in what is remembered as &quot;the greatest tragedy in our history and the most savage&quot; (prologue to the &quot;Nunca más&quot; report).

On September 2, 1976, the film &quot;Adiós Sui Géneris&quot;, directed by Bebe Kamin, with production and supervision by Leopoldo Torre Nilsson, was released, rated &quot;prohibited for minors under 18 years old&quot;.

==== 1974-1975: PorSuiGieco ====

In 1974, when Charly García had achieved widespread recognition in the rock world and was enjoying the massive popularity attained with Sui Generis, a proposal emerged to form a supergroup of musicians from the so-called &quot;acoustic rock&quot; to embark on a tour without a formal musical project, but to &quot;share good times, have fun playing and singing.&quot; Charly García, Raúl Porchetto, Nito Mestre, León Gieco, and María Rosa Yorio formed PorSuiGieco y su Banda de Avestruces Domadas. The name combines the men but omits the only woman, one of the few active in Argentine rock at the time. The band took inspiration from what North American artists like David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash, and Neil Young were doing with Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, one of Charly García&#x27;s musical/choral models since his high school musician days.

In May, PorSuiGieco began their group activities with a concert at the Auditorio Kraft, located on calle Florida. In July 1974, they went on a tour through the province of Buenos Aires, performing in Bahía Blanca, Tandil, and Mar del Plata. On July 5, 1975, they returned to perform in Tandil.

In 1976, after Sui Generis had disbanded and following several delays and issues, they recorded an album under the group&#x27;s name, &quot;PorSuiGieco&quot;. The album suffered from the pressure of self-censorship imposed by the actions of the Alianza Anticomunista Argentina (Triple A) and the coup groups preparing to overthrow the constitutional government. It had to be released without the track &quot;El fantasma de Canterville&quot;, which was nonetheless included unannounced in the inner sleeve. Years later, in 2002, a CD reissue of the album would set things right. The original acoustic folk proposal evolved into a more electric and sophisticated style, though without losing the freshness that characterized the group.

On March 24, 1976, a civic-military dictatorship took power, imposing a regime of state terrorism, with clandestine detention centers and task forces, responsible for kidnappings, assassinations, forced disappearances, rapes, confiscations, baby thefts, identity thefts, and forcing thousands into exile. Argentina was entering its darkest hour, with external debt, extremely high inflation, and mass impoverishment from which it would not recover in the following decades.

Sui Géneris was already a thing of the past, and Charly had begun to explore other musical paths. At the same time, he started going to a psychoanalyst as he continued to feel very anguished. He spent all day locked in his apartment, playing and composing, virtually without speaking to anyone.

==== 1976-1977: La Máquina de Hacer Pájaros ====

After recording the album &quot;PorSuiGieco&quot;, García&#x27;s next project was La Máquina de Hacer Pájaros (a name taken from a comic strip by Argentine cartoonist Crist), with Carlos Cutaia (keyboards), Gustavo Bazterrica (guitar and backing vocals), José Luis Fernández (bass and backing vocals), and Oscar Moro (drums and percussion).

La Máquina was Argentina&#x27;s most complex and profound attempt at symphonic rock, in which García introduced the novelty of two simultaneous keyboard players. This band was one of the most meticulously crafted Argentine bands in terms of sound, but it was not well received by critics and the public.

The dictatorship established on March 24, 1976, had created a regime of terror in which no one was safe. Charly lived in fear and went out as little as possible, believing that his name could appear on the blacklists at any moment.

They debuted in Cosquín, where they premiered some of the songs that would later compose the album bearing the same name as the band. For several months, from Thursday to Sunday, they performed at La Bola Loca, Atilio Stampone&#x27;s club, which hosted more than two hundred people each night to see them play live.

In July 1976, María Rosa became pregnant and gave birth to Miguel Ángel García in March 1977. Despite the arrival of the baby, the marriage was not going well. Charly García was deeply involved in his projects, focusing solely on his music, and María Rosa felt alone. A few months later, they decided to separate. It wasn&#x27;t long before María Rosa found new companionship: none other than Nito Mestre, Charly&#x27;s best friend.

During that winter, La Máquina gathered in a basement that flooded whenever it rained, to shape a second album: &quot;Películas&quot;. At the time, they had a peculiar record; their first album had been the most expensive in Argentine history, costing more than double the production of a common album.

In 1977, García attended an interview with the newspaper &quot;La Opinión&quot;, which brought together Argentine personalities from various genres. There, García was accused of making &quot;foreignizing&quot; music &quot;that had nothing to do with the national sentiment&quot;, apart from lacking &quot;the quality of the old tangos&quot; and that &quot;in 20 years, no one would remember him&quot;. This experience would inspire García to compose &quot;Los sobrevivientes&quot; and &quot;A los jóvenes de ayer&quot;.

The &quot;Festival del Amor&quot; marked the last performance of La Máquina, at a packed Luna Park, on November 11, 1977, where they shared the stage with Nito Mestre, León Gieco, Raúl Porchetto, Gustavo Santaolalla, the , among others. García struggled to adjust to this new life as a father, distant from María Rosa. During this difficult time, he met Marisa Zoca Pederneiras, a Brazilian dancer from Oscar Araiz&#x27;s ballet. Zoca would be his partner until the late 1980s and inspired several of his songs, such as &quot;Zocacola&quot; and &quot;Ella adivinó&quot;.
==== Serú Girán (1978–1982) ====
In São Paulo, Charly García, amidst escalating tensions with the younger members of La Máquina, particularly due to his stage behavior, decided to leave the band in 1977. He traveled to Brazil with his friend David Lebón, a fellow musician from the era of Sui Géneris. With the money they had earned at the Festival del Amor (Luna Park, November 11, 1977), they rented a house for three months in Búzios, north of Rio de Janeiro. This choice was driven by Charly&#x27;s need to be close to his girlfriend Zoca Pederneira and to escape the repressive military dictatorship in Argentina.

In São Paulo, Charly met Zoca&#x27;s parents, the Pederneiras, an artistic family who were captivated by his talent. Artistically, Charly was influenced by Brazilian musicians, especially Milton Nascimento. Despite the commercial success of Sui Generis, Charly was nearly destitute. By 1978, he was living a nature-focused life with Zoca in Brazil, fishing and gathering fruit. With a new musical partner, Charly began playing again, planting the seed for a new musical project. He was determined to form a new band, despite financial challenges. Upon returning to Buenos Aires, he began searching for bandmates.

Charly needed a bass player and a drummer. He found them during a live performance by the backing band of the rock duo Pastoral. There, he recruited a talented 19-year-old bass player, Pedro Aznar, and his former colleague from La Máquina, drummer Oscar Moro. The new band was composed of Charly García (vocals, keyboards), David Lebón (vocals, guitars), Pedro Aznar (bass, vocals), and Oscar Moro (drums). Charly and David were the principal songwriters.

In 1978, Billy Bond met García and Lebón in São Paulo as they were shaping Serú Girán. Bond produced their eponymous album but made them sign an exploitative contract. Unsatisfied, Bond used some tracks recorded by the band that were discarded for the &quot;Serú Girán&quot; album, added his voice over them, and used them for &quot;Billy Bond and the Jets&quot;, a largely unnoticed 1979 album. This album contained &quot;Loco (no te sobra una moneda)&quot;, the ironic disco song &quot;Discoshock&quot; (both by García), and a new funky version of &quot;Treinta y dos macetas&quot; from David Lebón&#x27;s celebrated solo album, renamed &quot;Toda la gente&quot;. After this formation was disbanded, Serú Girán was officially formed, with virtuoso melodies and lyrics that depicted the situation under the Argentine dictatorship. The band&#x27;s popularity was also reflected in the traditional surveys of the magazine &quot;Pelo&quot;. Serú Girán won several categories from 1978 to 1981, including best guitarist, keyboardist, bassist, drummer, composer (García), and live group. Additional awards included revelation group of 1978; best singer (Lebón) in 1980 and 1981; best song in 1978 (&quot;Seminare&quot;), and in 1981 (&quot;Peperina&quot;); and best album in 1978 (&quot;Serú Giran&quot;).

Despite returning to Buenos Aires with high expectations for Charly García&#x27;s new project, the beginnings were difficult. It was 1978, and the first album did not convince a skeptical public. The band&#x27;s first concert was poorly received, as the audience expected a new incarnation of Sui Generis. Serú Girán represented a complete departure, featuring a new sound where Aznar&#x27;s fretless bass guitar was central, and lyrics full of poetry and striking aesthetics. The audience actively requested Sui Generis&#x27; old songs. In response to the prevailing Disco music trend in Argentina in 1978, Serú Girán played a song called &quot;Disco Shock&quot; as a joke, further alienating the audience and marred the show.

The specialized press the next day dubbed Serú Girán &quot;the worst band&quot; in Argentina and accused David Lebón&#x27;s vocals of sounding &quot;homosexual&quot;. This led to a strained relationship with the media. A popular Argentine magazine, &quot;Gente&quot;, published a disparaging article titled &quot;Charly García: ¿Ídolo o qué?&quot; (&quot;Idol or what?&quot;). Despite the cold reception, the members of Serú Girán were convinced they had a strong project and continued to organize more shows, gradually winning acceptance from an audience that warmed up to their style.

Serú Girán&#x27;s evolution continued in 1979. Their new LP, &quot;La grasa de las capitales&quot; (&quot;Grease of The Capitals&quot; or &quot;The Fat of The Capitals&quot;), featured a cover that mocked the magazine &quot;Gente&quot;. The album&#x27;s direct and strong lyrics, which criticized the media (especially magazines like &quot;Gente&quot;), fashionable music, and radio, nearly resulted in the band&#x27;s imprisonment. However, the album was enthusiastically received by the public. The band&#x27;s performances improved, eventually being held in larger venues. The specialized press changed its attitude, and a romance developed between the people and Serú Girán.

In 1980, expectations were high for Serú Girán&#x27;s new album &quot;Bicicleta&quot; (&quot;Bicycle&quot;) – a name that Charly had originally favored for the band but was rejected by the other members. The band&#x27;s sound on this record was more mature, with modern and strong music marked by prominent melodies. Pedro Aznar&#x27;s bass guitar played a central role.

During Argentina&#x27;s last military dictatorship (1976–1983), Charly almost faced imprisonment in 1979 due to the band&#x27;s lyrics, which were considered too clear and direct. The political message in their songs became stronger yet concealed to avoid censorship and further confrontations with the military junta. However, the general message of protest remained discernible. The classic single &quot;Canción de Alicia en el país&quot; (&quot;Song of Alice in The Country&quot;) drew a clever analogy between Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and the Argentine dictatorship. &quot;Encuentro con el diablo&quot; (&quot;A Meeting with the Devil&quot;) referenced the band&#x27;s encounter with Interior minister Albano Harguindeguy, informally known as &quot;the Devil&quot;. Harguindeguy had conversations with some artists at the time, ordering them to tone down their work or threatening them with leaving the country, assassination, or forced disappearance.

Serú Girán&#x27;s commercial success grew, earning them the title of &quot;The Argentine Beatles&quot;. Charly began to receive recognition as a great artist. The band was the first popular rock group to attract a following among both the rich and the poor/working class, breaking rock music out of its historically marginal position. David Lebón later reflected, &quot;Actually, we were much more like Procol Harum than The Beatles, a legendary band: a rock &#x27;viola&#x27; (slang for guitar) player (Lebón), a classical pianist (García), an infernal percussionist (Moro) and a virtuoso bass player (Aznar).&quot;

Luis Alberto Spinetta, another Argentine rock star of the time, would eventually cross paths with Serú. Spinetta&#x27;s first band, Almendra, was one of the first in Argentine rock, predating Sui Generis. By the late 1970s, Spinetta had formed a jazz fusion/jazz rock band called Spinetta Jade. Spinetta Jade&#x27;s darker and more complex style of music was harder for general audiences to understand at the time, making Spinetta a less popular star than Charly. Nevertheless, Spinetta and Charly dispelled the myth of their rivalry on September 13, 1980, when both their bands, Serú Girán and Spinetta Jade, played together for the first time.

Patricia Perea, an 18-year-old student and correspondent for the magazine &quot;El Expreso Imaginario&quot;, covered a concert of Serú Girán and strongly criticized them after their performance in Córdoba, claiming their shows in the interior were inferior to those in the Capital Federal. Serú Girán responded to this criticism through their fourth LP, &quot;Peperina&quot;, which was named after Perea&#x27;s nickname and included a song about her. The title &quot;Peperina&quot; also referred to the practice in Córdoba Province of mixing yerba mate with the herb &quot;menta peperina&quot; (&quot;Bystropogon mollis&quot;, similar to peppermint), used as a tea. This album carried a political message, with the song &quot;José Mercado&quot; being a clear parody of José Martínez de Hoz, Minister of Economy during the last civil-military dictatorship in Argentina. The lyrics sarcastically criticized Martínez de Hoz&#x27;s tenure: &quot;José Mercado compra todo importado (...)/José es licenciado en Economía, pasa la vida comprando porquerías&quot; (&quot;Market Joe only buys imported stuff (...)/Joe has a degree in Economics/And spends his life buying garbage&quot;), targeting Argentina&#x27;s then-recent policy of economic neoliberalism.

One of the songs on &quot;Peperina&quot;, titled &quot;Llorando en el espejo&quot; (&quot;Crying in The Mirror&quot;), contained the famous verse: &quot;La línea blanca se terminó/no hay señales en tus ojos y estoy/llorando en el espejo...&quot; (&quot;The white line is up/there are no signs in your eyes/and I&#x27;m crying in the mirror...&quot;), portraying cocaine addiction in clear terms. At the time, these lyrics did not attract much attention from military censors.

In early 1982, Pedro Aznar left the band to study at Boston&#x27;s Berklee College of Music. Contrary to common belief, Aznar joined Pat Metheny&#x27;s band a full year later, in 1983. In March 1982, Serú returned to Obras Sanitarias to bid farewell to Pedro with a highly successful show, which was recorded and released that year as &quot;No llores por mí, Argentina&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t cry for me, Argentina&quot;). The loss of Aznar led to the band&#x27;s dissolution, as both Lebón and Charly were ready to pursue solo careers.

In 2019, the surviving members of Serú Girán, including Pedro Aznar and David Lebón, announced the remastering of the album &quot;La grasa de las capitales&quot;. This announcement marked a significant moment in the legacy of Serú Girán.

=== Second Period - Solo career ===
====Early solo success (1982–1985)====
In 1982, Argentina was undergoing political change. After the Falklands War () in June, social chaos erupted and the military government lost part of its power.

Charly García debuted as a soloist with a double LP, &quot;Pubis Angelical&quot; (&quot;Angelical Pubis&quot;), which was the eponymous movie&#x27;s soundtrack, and the powerful &quot;Yendo de la cama al living&quot; (&quot;Going from the bed to the living room&quot;). Four hit songs from this album left their historical mark: 
#&quot;No bombardeen Buenos Aires&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t bomb Buenos Aires&quot;) showed the panic in lived out in the city during the Falklands War, and strongly criticized Argentina&#x27;s last civil-military dictatorship (1976–1983), especially then ruling dictator Leopoldo Galtieri (Roger Waters from Pink Floyd, on the other side of the trenches at that time, also criticized Galtieri in their 1983 Final Cut album).
#&quot;Yendo de la cama al living&quot; (&quot;Going from the bed to the living room&quot;) used the experience of being trapped in a confined space as a symbol of the repression of ideas.
#&quot;Inconsciente colectivo&quot; (&quot;Collective unconscious&quot;) was a message of hope and liberty for the stricken Argentine people.
#&quot;Yo no quiero volverme tan loco&quot; (&quot;I don&#x27;t want to go so crazy&quot;) was a song about the adolescent spirit of freedom and rebelliousness.

The LP&#x27;s presentation took place in December at the Ferrocarril Oeste Stadium (or Ferro). As the song &quot;No bombardeen Buenos Aires&quot; drew to a close near the end of the show, backdrop props simulating Buenos Aires were destroyed with fireworks.
In 1983, Charly left Buenos Aires with a small suitcase. When he returned to Buenos Aires from New York, he brought a quality LP titled &quot;Clics Modernos&quot; (&quot;Modern Clicks&quot;) that was different from anything previously done in Argentine rock – it was highly singable rock music you could also dance to. Its strong message referred the past years: Exodus in &quot;Plateado sobre plateado (huellas en el mar)&quot; (&quot;Silver on Silver, Footprints on the Sea&quot;), repression in &quot;Nos siguen pegando abajo&quot; (&quot;They keep hitting us down there&quot;), &quot;No me dejan salir&quot; (&quot;They won&#x27;t let me out&quot;) and &quot;Los dinosaurios&quot; (&quot;The Dinosaurs&quot;), a nostalgic but defiant remembrance of those who were kidnapped, tortured, or killed.

On December 10, the course of Argentine history took a turn as the government became a democracy. Charly performed many well-received shows in 1984, and recorded another album during its last months. García also recorded an LP called &quot;Terapia intensiva&quot; (&quot;Intensive care&quot;), another movie soundtrack. One of Charly&#x27;s shows that year took place in an underground bar, with his new group named &quot;Giovanni y los de Plástico&quot; (&quot;Giovanni and the Plastic Ones&quot;). &quot;Piano Bar&quot; was released in 1984, completing García&#x27;s golden trilogy.

During these years, García&#x27;s band was home to many future Argentine music stars, including Andrés Calamaro, Fito Páez, Pablo Guyot, Willy Iturri, Alfredo Toth and Fabiana Cantilo.

====Massive stardom and classic albums (1985–1989)====
After the success of &quot;Piano Bar&quot;, which was García&#x27;s consecration as a soloist, 1985 was a year to slow down. Charly met again with Pedro Aznar in New York by chance, but they took advantage of this meeting and recorded &quot;Tango&quot;. The record had some interesting material, but it did not achieve commercial success primarily due to limited distribution.
In 1987, García came back with &quot;Parte de la Religión&quot; (&quot;Part of the Religion&quot;), a very interesting LP. Many songs from that LP became hits. Two of them, &quot;No voy en tren&quot; (&quot;I don&#x27;t take the train&quot;) and &quot;Necesito tu amor&quot; (&quot;I need your love&quot;) are the perfect symbol of García&#x27;s dichotomies: the first one says &quot;&quot; (&quot;I don&#x27;t need anybody around me&quot;), and the second one says &quot;&quot; (&quot;I need your love/your love saves me and is useful to me&quot;). This LP is also featured a song, &quot;Rezo por vos&quot; (&quot;I pray for you&quot;), which was part of a project with Luis Alberto Spinetta that was never finished.

In 1988, Charly made his acting debut at the age of 36, playing a nurse in the movie &quot;Lo que vendrá&quot; (&quot;What is to come&quot;), the soundtrack of which he also composed. Being a nurse had long been one of García&#x27;s obsessions. Later that year, the Amnesty International festival wrapped up in Buenos Aires. Starring international and local rock stars, Peter Gabriel, Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Charly García and León Gieco were there.

In 1989, Puerto Rican pop star Wilkins invited Charly to record his classic &quot;Yo No Quiero Volverme Tan Loco&quot;, alongside Ilan Chester, from Venezuela, as a tribute to &quot;Rock en Español&quot;; the song was featured in Wilkins&#x27; &quot;L.A-N.Y.&quot; album.

Later that year, Charly released a new album, &quot;Cómo conseguir chicas&quot; (&quot;How to get girls&quot;). This would probably be his last &quot;normal&quot; album. He described it as &quot;Just a bunch of songs that were never published for different reasons&quot;.

Charly&#x27;s father had long ago told him, &quot;Never write an anagram for someone if you don&#x27;t want him or her to be pissed off&quot;. During the Serú Girán years, his friend David Lebón told him something similar: &quot;Do not write a song for a woman if you love her, because she&#x27;ll leave you&quot;. The LP includes a song titled &quot;Shisyastawuman&quot; (a deliberately direct transliteration of &quot;She&#x27;s just a woman&quot;), the first song García recorded in English that was written to a woman. The woman left him after hearing the song, just like Lebón had warned. A song named &quot;Zocacola&quot; that Charly dedicated to Zoca was included in this LP as well. A couple of months after the record was released, Zoca left him.

García had changed. Physically, he looked older. His music was dark, and the earlier symphonical García from La Máquina de Hacer Pájaros was gone. Now, Charly&#x27;s sound was closer to either punk rock, with violent songs such as &quot;No toquen&quot; (&quot;Do Not Touch&quot;), or a depressive and dark style as shown in &quot;No me verás en el subte&quot; (&quot;You Won&#x27;t See Me in the Subway&quot;). Different and adverse times lay ahead.

For the international tour in 1989/1990, García formed a new band with Hilda Lizarazu, who sang backup vocals for Charly.

====Days of excess (1990–1993)====
In 1990, Charly had many ideas but no band. Another important member of the band, Fabián &quot;Zorrito&quot; Von Quintiero, had left to join another band, Los Ratones Paranoicos (The Paranoid Mice). Hilda Lizarazu was busy with her band called Man Ray. For &quot;Filosofía barata y zapatos de goma&quot; (&quot;Cheap Philosophy and Rubber Shoes&quot;) Charly gathered many of his old friends, who helped record most of the songs. Assisting him, among others, were Andrés Calamaro, Rinaldo Rafanelli, Fabiana Cantilo, &quot;Nito&quot; Mestre, Pedro Aznar, Fabián Von Quintiero and even Hilda Lizarazu. The first issue came once the disc was released. Its last song was a rock version of the &quot;Himno Nacional Argentino&quot;, or the Argentine national anthem. Amid controversy, García&#x27;s version of the national anthem was forbidden for some days, but García was victorious, a judge authorizing the song. 

That year, the Government of Buenos Aires organized Mi Buenos Aires Rock (My B.A. rock), a public rock festival on Avenue 9 de Julio, the city&#x27;s most famous avenue. Every act was scheduled to play 30 minutes, but Charly played for over two hours. He closed the festival playing his version of the national anthem to one hundred thousand people.

In December 1992, Charly again embraced his past and surprisingly re-formed Serú Girán. Charly García, David Lebón, Pedro Aznar and Oscar Moro were back after ten years. A new album was recorded, titled &quot;Serú 92&quot;. It enjoyed great commercial success, but musically was sharply different from Serú Girán&#x27;s other records.

Serú Girán performed two sold-out shows at the Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti, the largest in Argentina. Serú Girán had always been at its best when live, the four members playing very well together. This time, in Moro&#x27;s words, &quot;the show sounded like Charly García and Serú Girán&quot;.

====&quot;Say No More&quot; era (1994–2000)====
After not having released any new solo material since 1990, in 1994 García was ready to strike back. The new project was called &quot;La hija de &quot;La Lágrima&quot;&quot; (&quot;The Tear&#x27;s Daughter&quot;). This LP would be an introduction to the future concept of &quot;Say No More&quot;.

Also during 1994, the Soccer World Cup was being played in the United States. Soccer player legend Diego Armando Maradona was involved in a dispute with FIFA regarding a drug test for ephedrine doping, which he failed, preventing him from playing. After Diego was sent home, Argentina lost two important matches and was knocked out of the World Cup. When the last match was about to end, Charly called Diego on his cell phone and sang to him &quot;live&quot; the &quot;Maradona&#x27;s Blues&quot;, a song he composed for him. Diego cried when he heard &quot;Un accidente no es pecado/y no es pecado estar así&quot; (&quot;An accident is not a sin/And is not a sin to be like this&quot;), and the two struck up a friendship.

1995 was again a musical year. García formed a new band for touring on summertime (with María Gabriela Epumer, Juan Bellia, Fabián Von Quintiero, Jorge Suárez and Fernando Samalea) and named it as &quot;Casandra Lange&quot;. His idea with the band was to play songs Charly had heard as a teen, such as &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; (Mick Jagger–Keith Richards) and &quot;There&#x27;s a Place&quot; (John Lennon–Paul McCartney). He recorded the performances and edit a live album, &quot;Estaba en llamas cuando me acosté&quot; (&quot;I was on fire when went to bed&quot;). All of the songs in this album are in English except for &quot;Te recuerdo invierno&quot; (&quot;I remember you, winter&quot;), which García had written in the early 1970s but never recorded with Sui Generis. In May, Charly recorded &quot;Hello! MTV Unplugged&quot;, which is often considered by music critics as the last time that the rock star played his music to his full potential.

&quot;Say No More&quot; arrived in 1996. &quot;Say No More&quot; was a new concept for García: &quot;&#x27;Say No More&#x27; would be in music what painting directly on the canvas would be for a painter&quot;, he explained. He also said that the LP &quot;will only be understood in 20 years&quot;. Today the album is considered García&#x27;s masterpiece, and &quot;Say no more&quot; the classic slogan identifying Charly García and all his music.

During 1997, García recorded &quot;Alta Fidelidad&quot; (&quot;High Fidelity&quot;) with Mercedes Sosa. Both had known each other since his childhood, so they decided to publish a collaborative work on which Mercedes would sing her favorite García songs of all time.

In 1998, &quot;El aguante&quot; (&quot;Holding On&quot;) was released. This production featured many covers translated to Spanish by García, like &quot;Tin Soldier&quot; (Small Faces), or &quot;Roll over Beethoven&quot; (Chuck Berry). A significant song which was not included was &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot; by Procol Harum, a band that Charly has admittedly always admired.

In February 1999, García performed at the closing of the free public-rock festival &quot;Buenos Aires Vivo III&quot; (BA Live III). There he played a huge concert for 250.000 fans who attended one of the biggest concerts in Argentina up to that date. In July 1999, Charly agreed to give a private performance on Quinta de Olivos (the Argentine Presidential residence), at the request of the president, Carlos Saúl Menem. On a televised bit of this event he was seen in good spirits, carrying out antics such as playing with the security cameras, or trying to teach the president how to play the piano. A limited edition of a disc memorializing the famous concert, &quot;Charly &amp; Charly&quot;, was released that year. Since its release, &quot;Charly &amp; Charly&quot; has been out of print, and is currently available only in bootleg copies on Internet sites.

====Maravillización (2000–2003)====
In 2000, Charly and Nito Mestre decided to bring Sui Generis back to life. For the special occasion, they both composed the songs for a new LP, &quot;Sinfonías para adolescentes&quot; (&quot;Symphonies for Adolescents&quot;). This new period would be marked by García&#x27;s new &quot;sound concept&quot; of Maravillización or &quot;Making something marvellous&quot;, replacing the old dark &quot;Say no more&quot; style.

Finally Sui Generis played again in the Boca Juniors&#x27;s Stadium, for 25,000 fans on December 7, 2000. Charly played for almost four hours.

Many journalists criticized this return, stating that the main cause for it was the money and that both members of the band had changed so much, that the new album and show had nothing to do with the &quot;real&quot; Sui Generis.

During 2001, &quot;¡Si! Detrás de las paredes&quot; (&quot;B [the musical note]! Behind the Walls&quot;) was edited as the second and last Sui Generis&#x27;s LP in this new era. It was a mash up between live versions of the Boca Juniors&#x27;s concert, new songs (as &quot;Telepáticamente&quot;) and some versions of old songs. (such as &quot;Rasguña Las Piedras&quot;, featuring Gustavo Cerati, former leader of Soda Stereo). Besides on October 23, 2001, Charly reached age 50. For the occasion, a special concert in the Colliseum Theater was organized.

After this interruption in his solo Career, Charly got back to the spotlight after releasing &quot;Influencia&quot; (&quot;Influence&quot;) in 2002. This new disc contained some interesting songs that made an impact in the Latin American world of Rock, such as &quot;Tu Vicio&quot; (&quot;Your Vice&quot;), &quot;Influencia&quot; (&quot;Influence&quot;, translated cover from Todd Rundgren&#x27;s original &quot;Influenza&quot;) and &quot;I&#x27;m Not In Love&quot; (featuring Tony Sheridan). Even though it included old songs as &quot;Happy And Real&quot; (from &quot;Tango IV&quot;, 1991) or &quot;Uno A Uno&quot; (&quot;One to one&quot;, from &quot;El Aguante&quot;, 1998) and different versions of the same songs, this was probably García&#x27;s best album since 1994.

Live concerts of &quot;Influencia&quot; were probably Charly&#x27;s best in a long, long time. With the strong support of María Gabriela Epumer in chorus and guitar, Charly showed up in many different concerts, such as two in the Luna Park Stadium, Viña del Mar and Cosquín Rock with correct performances.

Finally in October 2003, Charly released &quot;Rock and Roll, Yo&quot; (&quot;Rock and Roll, Me&quot;), dedicated to María Gabriela. The songs weren&#x27;t as good as those in &quot;Influencia&quot;, his voice often sounds out of tune and, once again the LP contained too many versions and translated covers such as &quot;Linda Bailarina&quot; (&quot;Pretty Ballerina&quot;, Michael Brown) or &quot;Wonder&quot; (&quot;Love´S in Need of Love Today&quot; by Stevie Wonder). 

====Drop into the background (2004–2008)====
In 2004 García achieved one of his most remarkable and positive landmarks of that era: he played for the second time in Casa Rosada, the Argentine Government Palace. This event took place during the presidency of Néstor Kirchner. On April 30, 2007, Charly performed in the Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires at the invitation of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo Human Rights&#x27; Organization, commemorating their 30th Anniversary. Also around that time García routinely performed throughout Argentina and South America.

On June 14, 2008, the &quot;Clarín&quot; newspaper reported that Charly García was taken to a hospital in the city of Mendoza due to a violent episode in which the musician thrashed a hotel room in Mendoza. Sources related the incident to an overdose of drugs and alcohol. After the incident García&#x27;s friend, the singer and former politician Palito Ortega, took Charly to his country estate in Buenos Aires Province, where Ortega helped him to begin a treatment with several doctors and psychiatrists to cure his addiction. The recovery process took almost an entire year.

=== Third Period - Comeback and status as a living legend (2009-present) ===

==== Recovery, new material ====
After a year-long recovery living in Ortega&#x27;s estate, a cured and stable Charly came back in August 2009 with a new song called &quot;Deberías Saber Por qué&quot; (You Should Know Why). The song became a hit and soon Charly embarked on a large tour through Chile and Perú to promote his return. On October 23 García celebrated his 58th birthday with a concert in Velez Sarfield&#x27;s Stadium, Argentina. This concert has been referred to as &quot;The Underwater Concert&quot; because of the heavy rain that fell that night.

In October 2011, Charly was the last guest on Susana Giménez&#x27; TV show&#x27;s final episode. While appearing on the show, he performed the song &quot;Desarma y Sangra&quot;, originally from his band Serú Girán.
In September 2013, Charly performed in an exclusive show called &quot;Líneas Paralelas, Artificio imposible&quot; (Parallel Lines, Impossible Craft) at Teatro Colón, along with two string quartets (baptized &quot;Kashmir Orchestra&quot; in homage to the band Led Zeppelin) and his bandmates &quot;The Prostitution&quot;. At the venue, they made classical arrangements to Charly&#x27;s own songs under his own musical direction. Charly then traveled to Mendoza City to present various compositions made across his life, specially the ones he created since the 2000s.

==== &quot;Random&quot; ====
In 2016 Charly had several health problems and appeared to walk in and out of clinics and medical controls. On February 24, 2017, after months of speculation about Charly&#x27;s health, he surprisingly announced the release of his new studio album, &quot;Random&quot;, his first studio album in seven years, which is entirely made of new original compositions. Since its release, the album has received mostly positive reviews and important record sales.

On April 19, 2017, Charly accused Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson of plagiarism, stating that their song &quot;Uptown Funk&quot; stole the initial chords and riff of his classic song &quot;Fanky&quot;, from &quot;Cómo conseguir chicas&quot; (1989).
In October 2021 Argentina&#x27;s government organized a special event to celebrate Charly García&#x27;s 70th birthday. In a historic and emotional day, the Kirchner Cultural Centre (CCK) (part of the Ministry of Culture), celebrated García&#x27;s birthday with live music, a series of talks/lectures and performances. A series of live concerts were held at the CCK, where several of Argentina&#x27;s most important musicians covered García&#x27;s classic repertoire. Charly himself made a surprise appearance and performed for the cheering crowd.

Recent Years

In 2024 García released his fourteenth solo album, &quot;La lógica del escorpión&quot;. It was first released in physical format (vinyl record), and then on digital platforms.

It features the stellar participation of David Lebón, Pedro Aznar, Fito Páez and Luis Alberto Spinetta, the latter posthumously, using previously unreleased recordings.

The band for the album is mainly composed of Kiuge Hayashida (guitar), Fernando Kabusacki (guitar), Hilda Lizarazu (backing vocals), Rosario Ortega (backing vocals), Fernando Samalea (drums), Toño Silva (drums).

Among the songs on the album is a Spanish version of “Watching the Wheels” - one of the tracks on John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Double Fantasy&quot; album, an essential reference for Charly García, being the first time that Yoko Ono authorized the translation into Spanish of a John Lennon song. 

In the first week, all 13 &quot;tracks&quot; of the work entered the Spotify top 50 in Argentina, with “Rompela” at #5 and the rest within the top 35. On YouTube, more than half of the album&#x27;s tracks entered the Top 30.

<text>Shi and shih are romanizations of the character /, the Chinese word for all poetry generally and across all languages.

In Western analysis of the styles of Chinese poetry, &quot;shi&quot; is also used as a term of art for a specific poetic tradition, modeled after the Old Chinese works collected in the Confucian &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot;. This anthology included both aristocratic poems (the &quot;Hymns&quot; and &quot;Eulogies&quot;) and more rustic works believed to have derived from Huaxia folk songs (the &quot;Odes&quot;). They are composed in ancient Chinese, mostly in four-character lines. In such analysis, &quot;&quot;shi&quot; poetry is contrasted with other forms such as the Chu-derived &quot;cí&quot; and the Han-era &quot;fu&quot;&quot;. This use is not common within Chinese literature, however, which instead classifies these poems into other categories such as classical Chinese poetry, Fields and Gardens poetry, and &quot;curtailed&quot; poetry.

==Forms==
===Gushi===
Gushi, which means &quot;Ancient Poetry&quot;, may be used in either of two senses. It may be used broadly to refer to the ancient poetry of China, chiefly the mostly anonymous works collected in the Confucian &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot;, the separate tradition exemplified by Qu Yuan and Song Yu&#x27;s &quot;Songs of Chu&quot;, and the works collected by the Han &quot;Music Bureau&quot;.

It may also be used strictly to refer to poems in the styles of the Confucian classic, regardless of their time of composition. Owing to the variety of pieces included in the &quot;Classic&quot;, there are few formal constraints apart from line length (usually four characters and no more than seven) and rhyming every other line.

===Jintishi===

Jintishi, which means &quot;Modern Poetry&quot;, was actually composed from the 5th century onwards and is considered to have been fully developed by the early Tang dynasty. The works were principally written in five- and seven-character lines and involve constrained tone patterns, intended to balance the four tones of Middle Chinese within each couplet. The principal forms are the four-line &quot;jueju&quot;, the eight-line &quot;lüshi&quot;, and the unlimited &quot;pailü&quot;. In addition to the tonal patterns, &quot;lüshi&quot; and &quot;pailü&quot; were usually understood to further require parallelism in their interior couplets: a theme developed in one couplet would be contrasted in the following one, usually by means of the same parts of speech.

<doc id="671287" wikidata="Q613634" url="?curid=671287" title="Tenjho Tenge">
<text>, also written as Tenjo Tenge, is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Oh! great. It was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Ultra Jump&quot; from July 1997 to August 2010, with its chapters collected in 22 &#x27; volumes. The story primarily focuses on the members of the Juken Club and their opposition, the Executive Council, which is the ruling student body of a high school that educates its students in the art of combat. As the story unfolds, both groups become increasingly involved with an ongoing battle that has been left unresolved for four hundred years.

It was adapted into a 24-episode anime television series broadcast on TV Asahi from April to September 2004. A two-episode original video animation (OVA) was released in March 2005.

Both versions of the series have been licensed for release in English language by two different companies. The manga was licensed and released by CMX beginning in 2005, which came under criticism by fans for editing its sexual content. When CMX closed down in 2010, after releasing 18 volumes, Viz Media picked up the rights and completed their own uncut release of the series in 2013. The anime was licensed and released by Geneon Entertainment, also beginning in 2005, however, it is now licensed by Discotek Media.

==Plot==

The plot begins with Souichiro Nagi and his childhood best friend Bob Makihara going to their first day of high school at Toudou Academy. They had intended to rule the school by beating up anybody that got in their way, as they had done at their previous schools. They soon learn that Toudou is no ordinary high school, but rather a school that was founded to teach and integrate different fighting styles. Its students are skilled in the various arts of combat with some students possessing supernatural abilities, such as pyrokinesis, precognition, and superhuman strength based on the abilities to use their &quot;spirit&quot; or &quot;ki&quot; in Japanese. After an altercation with the Executive Council, Souichiro and Bob join the only surviving club that opposes them, the Juken club. As the storyline develops, both groups find they are becoming increasingly involved in a long enduring conflict that was left unresolved from the Japanese feudal era by some of the characters&#x27; ancestors.

==Media==
===Manga===

Written and illustrated by Oh! Great, &quot;Tenjho Tenge&quot; was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Ultra Jump&quot; from July 25, 1997, to August 19, 2010. It was Oh! Great&#x27;s first crossover mainstream manga from writing and illustrating hentai manga. Shueisha collected its chapters in 22 &#x27; volumes, released from May 19, 1998, to November 19, 2010.

&quot;Tenjho Tenge&quot; was licensed for an English language publication by CMX, an imprint of DC Comics, as one of their launch titles and the first volume was released on February 16, 2005. Their version of the manga is heavily edited/censored in order for them to give it a Teen &quot;rating&quot; &quot;to give it the widest possible distribution in the United States&quot;. According to CMX, these changes were made in conjunction with Shueisha and &quot;Tenjho Tenge&quot; creator Oh! Great, who examines each of their changes. This censorship however garnered quite a bit of controversy. CMX released eighteen volumes in North America before the company was shut down in July 2010.

In November 2010, Viz Media acquired the rights to the &quot;Tenjho Tenge&quot; manga, stating that their version would be 100% uncut and faithful to the original Japanese. From June 21, 2011, to February 5, 2013, they released the series bi-monthly in eleven 2-in-1 volumes, which collects two individual volumes into a single large one. Viz&#x27;s releases also includes omake, color pages from the series&#x27;s original run in &quot;Ultra Jump&quot;, and since each release will cover two volumes, the second cover will be printed in as a color page. The manga is also published in many other countries, such as in Taiwan by Sharp Point Press, in Italy, France and Germany by Panini Comics, in Mexico by Grupo Editorial Vid, in Brazil by Editora JBC, and in Spain by Norma Editorial.

===Anime===

The &quot;Tenjho Tenge&quot; anime was directed by Toshifumi Kawase, animated by Madhouse but the whole series is animated by DR MOVIE 1 Korean animation service studio, produced by TV Asahi and Avex Mode, the animation division of the Avex group of companies. The twenty-four episodes were originally aired weekly on TV Asahi in Japan on Thursdays from April 1, 2004, to September 16, 2004. These episodes were made into eight-volume DVD box sets. Two additional episodes were broadcast by TV Asahi in Japan on March 16, 2005, and released in the form of an original video animation named &quot;Tenjho Tenge: Ultimate Fight&quot;. The anime follows closely to its source material up to the manga&#x27;s eighth volume with the exception of the sexual content which was toned down. The anime series has been licensed in English by Geneon Entertainment.

Although not mentioned on the Geneon Entertainment&#x27;s website, or the Tenjho Tenge mini-site, the OVA is available on the last volume, sometimes listed as episodes 25 and 26. In Australia and the UK, the series was released over seven volumes, and includes the OVA on the seventh disc. Almost 5 years after the closure of Geneon USA, Discotek Media re-licensed the series for a DVD release in 2013. Viewster later added the anime series into their streaming service alongside Galaxy Express 999 and Adieu Galaxy Express 999 anime films in 2016.

===Music===

The anime&#x27;s music, including the background music and theme songs, were composed and performed by various artists, such as m.c.A.T and Aiko Kayo who provided the opening and closing themes songs of the anime. In 2004, Avex record label released the &quot;Tenjho Tenge&quot; soundtrack and a single. In 2005, Avex released two character collection albums.

==Reception==

===Manga===
The &quot;Tenjho Tenge&quot; manga is described by Chris Beveridge of Anime On DVD as an &quot;engaging mix of action and comedy together while wrapping it all up in a large plot that&#x27;s fairly dark and really violent at times&quot;. Its creator, Oh! Great, is known to flavor his works with wanton sex and violence. Oh! Great uses sex as an important aspect of the storyline by using it as a powerful motivator both negatively and positively. He often has his characters contemplate the significance and importance of fighting as well as the meaning of strength. This conscious deliberation of subjective reasoning and objective truth between characters is the most imperative aspect of a story and is considered to be rare in manga. Dani Moure of Anime On DVD said readers may find that Oh! Great&#x27;s narrative is occasionally hard to follow and at times the plot moves slowly. Oh! Great is known for his characters to have unrealistic body proportions, and &quot;Tenjho Tenge&quot; is no different. The majority of the female characters have &quot;ultra large breasts&quot; and the male characters are extraordinarily muscular, but this facilitates the characters&#x27; personalities to come through in their distinctive features. The manga sold over 10.7 million copies, and volumes regularly appeared in the top twenty best-selling manga on Japanese Tohan charts and North American Diamond Comic Distributors charts.

===Anime===
The &quot;Tenjho Tenge&quot; anime is described as a significantly toned down version of the Japanese manga, but still retains most of the spirit of its predecessor. Much of the nudity was removed by the animators, but was made up in the way of sexual innuendos, gratuitous cleavage, and panty shots. Since the anime is a close adaptation of the manga, critique of the plot is comparable to the manga&#x27;s. Some reviewers felt that the anime was handled in a frantic and ill-planned manner that made the conclusion not satisfactory even with the original video animation. The animation done by Madhouse is considered to be well done. They used bright vibrant colors, solid backgrounds, and plenty of visible detail with very little pixelation or jagged movement, but at times used repeated character shots and animations. The animation done during the fight scenes is done in real time and is done as close to reality as possible while still bending, and often violating, the laws of physics. The early fight scenes are thought to be the &quot;most intense seen in recent anime&quot; by Kevin Gilvear of DVD Times. Carlo Santos of Anime News Network affirmed the quality of animation in these scenes does drop somewhat over time, but the action still looks better than the average fighting anime. Both the Japanese and English voice acting are considered to be good, but the English dub at times can be a little uneven. The English dub on occasion has poor dialogue, according to Anime News Network&#x27;s Patrick King, which causes it to lose much of the anime&#x27;s sincerity. Overall, the anime is considered to be above average, but suffers from a lack of a good ending, mainly because the anime only covered the first arc of the story.

The series&#x27; original soundtrack is considered to be average. Most of the music does well with setting the tone within the anime, although some reviewers found it to be somewhat repetitive. Some found the drama tracks to be unsatisfactory, even though they were &quot;well executed&quot;. For many, the highlight of the soundtrack is m.c.A.T&#x27;s &quot;Bomb A Head!&quot;, which was used as the anime&#x27;s opening song.

==Controversy==
CMX came under a great deal of criticism from readers for its edits. These edits included the length and breadth of the book, censoring out anything they felt was questionable for a teen audience such as covering up or removing nudity, fanservice, and sexual innuendo as well as a removal of an omake chapter. This was done by a brand whose promotional material asserts that it offers &quot;pure manga—100% the way the original Japanese creators want you to see it.&quot; One of grievances made against CMX is that the edits are not only severe, but very noticeable. One review states it is &quot;possibly the most heavily censored title in the history of the North American manga industry.&quot;

In response, protesters boycotted the edited version and even started up their own website. Immediately following the controversy, Jake Tarbox, group editor of CMX, resigned from the company. &quot;Tarbox was widely blamed by the fan community for the censoring of &quot;Tenjho Tenge&quot;, although inside sources suggest that Tarbox was not responsible for the decision to censor the manga.&quot; In the face of complaints, CMX had internal discussions about the possibility of publishing an unedited version of &quot;Tenjho Tenge&quot;, but decided to complete the current version. At the 2007 Anime Expo, CMX announced that they planned to change &quot;Tenjho Tenge&quot;″s rating to Mature beginning with volume fifteen, but warned that it still would be edited, but more lightly. Jason Thompson declared CMX&#x27;s censorship of the series one of &quot;The Greatest Censorship Fails&quot; in manga.

<text>&quot;Shambel&quot; Abebe Bikila (; August 7, 1932 – October 25, 1973) was an Ethiopian marathon runner who was a back-to-back Olympic marathon champion. He was the first Ethiopian Olympic gold medalist, winning his first gold medal at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome while running barefoot. At the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, he won his second gold medal, making him the first athlete to successfully defend an Olympic marathon title. In both victories, he ran in world record time.

Born in Shewa, Abebe moved to Addis Ababa around 1952 and joined the 5th Infantry Regiment of the Ethiopian Imperial Guard, an elite infantry division that safeguarded the emperor of Ethiopia. Abebe served in the Kagnew Battalion during the Korean War.

Enlisting as a soldier before his athletic career, he rose to the rank of &quot;shambel&quot; (captain). Abebe participated in a total of sixteen marathons. He placed second on his first marathon in Addis Ababa, won twelve other races, and finished fifth in the 1963 Boston Marathon. In July 1967, he sustained the first of several sports-related leg injuries that prevented him from finishing his last two marathons. Abebe was a pioneer in long-distance running. Mamo Wolde, Juma Ikangaa, Tegla Loroupe, Paul Tergat, and Haile Gebrselassie—all recipients of the New York Road Runners&#x27; Abebe Bikila Award—are a few of the athletes who have followed in his footsteps to establish East Africa as a force in long-distance running.

On March 22, 1969, Abebe was paralysed due to a car accident. He regained some upper-body mobility, but he never walked again. While he was receiving medical treatment in England, Abebe competed in archery and table tennis at the 1970 Stoke Mandeville Games in London. Those games were an early predecessor of the Paralympic Games. He competed in both sports at a 1971 competition for disabled people in Norway and won its cross-country sleigh-riding event. Abebe died at age 41 in 1973 of a cerebral haemorrhage related to his accident four years earlier. He received a state funeral, and Emperor Haile Selassie declared a national day of mourning. Many schools, venues, and events, including Abebe Bikila Stadium in Addis Ababa, are named after him. He is the subject of biographies and films documenting his athletic career, and he is often featured in publications about the marathon and the Olympics.

== Biography ==

===Early life===

Abebe Bikila was born on August 7, 1932, in the small community of Jato, then part of the Selale District of Shewa. His birthday coincided with the 1932 Los Angeles Olympic marathon. Abebe was the son of Wudinesh Beneberu and her second husband, Demissie. During the Second Italo-Ethiopian War (1935–1937), his family was forced to move to the remote town of Gorro. By then, Wudinesh had divorced Abebe&#x27;s father and married Temtime Kefelew. The family eventually moved back to Jato (or nearby Jirru), where they had a farm.

As a young boy, Abebe played gena, a traditional long-distance hockey game played with goalposts sometimes kilometres apart. Around 1952, he joined the 5th Infantry Regiment of the Imperial Guard after moving to Addis Ababa the year before. During the mid-1950s, Abebe ran from the hills of Sululta to Addis Ababa and back every day. Onni Niskanen, a Swedish coach employed by the Ethiopian government to train the Imperial Guard, soon noticed him and began training him for the marathon. In 1956, Abebe finished second to Wami Biratu in the Ethiopian Armed Forces championship. According to biographer Tim Judah, his entry in the Olympics was a &quot;long planned operation&quot; and not a last-minute decision, as was commonly thought.

Abebe was 27 when he married 15-year-old Yewebdar Wolde-Giorgis on March 16, 1960. Although the marriage was arranged by his mother, Abebe was happy and they remained married for the rest of his life.

===1960 Rome Olympics===
In July 1960, Abebe won his first marathon in Addis Ababa. A month later he won again in Addis Ababa with a time of 2:21:23, which was faster than the existing Olympic record held by Emil Zátopek. Niskanen entered Abebe Bikila and Abebe Wakgira in the marathon at the 1960 Rome Olympics, which would be run on September 10. In Rome, Abebe purchased new running shoes, but they did not fit well and gave him blisters. He consequently decided to run barefoot instead.

Due to Rome&#x27;s blistering heat, the race started in late-afternoon at the foot of the Capitoline Hill staircase and finished at night at the Arch of Constantine, just outside the Colosseum. The course twice passed Piazza di Porta Capena, where the Obelisk of Axum was then located. When the runners passed the obelisk the first time, Abebe was at the rear of the lead pack, which included Great Britain&#x27;s Arthur Keily, Moroccan Rhadi Ben Abdesselam, Ireland&#x27;s Bertie Messitt, and Belgian Aurèle Vandendriessche.

Between and , the lead changed hands several times. By about , however, Abebe and ben Abdesselam moved away from the rest of the pack. Trailing by about two minutes at the mark were New Zealand&#x27;s Barry Magee, who was to finish third in 2:17:18.2 and Sergei Popov, the world marathon record holder at the time, who finished fifth.

Abebe and ben Abdesselam remained together until the last . Nearing the obelisk again, Abebe sprinted to the finish. In the early-evening darkness, his path along the Appian Way was lined with Italian soldiers holding torches. Abebe&#x27;s winning time was 2:15:16.2, twenty-five seconds faster than ben Abdesselam at 2:15:41.6, and breaking Popov&#x27;s world record by eight tenths of a second. Immediately after crossing the finish line Abebe began to touch his toes and run in place, and later said that he could have run another .

===1960–1964===

Abebe returned to his homeland as a hero. He was greeted by a large crowd, many dignitaries and the commander of the Imperial Guard, Brigadier-General Mengistu Neway. Abebe was paraded through the streets of Addis Ababa along a procession route lined with thousands of people and presented to Emperor Haile Selassie. The Emperor awarded him the Star of Ethiopia and promoted him to the rank of &quot;asiraleqa&quot; (corporal). He was given the use of a chauffeur-driven Volkswagen Beetle (since he did not yet know how to drive) and home, both owned by the guard.

On December 13, 1960, while Haile Selassie was on a state visit to Brazil, Imperial Guard forces led by Mengistu Neway began an unsuccessful coup and briefly proclaimed Selassie&#x27;s eldest son Asfaw Wossen Taffari emperor. Fighting took place in the heart of Addis Ababa, shells detonated in the Jubilee Palace, and many of those closest to the Emperor were killed. Although Abebe was not directly involved, he was briefly arrested and questioned. Mengistu was later hanged, and his forces (which included many members of the Imperial Guard) were killed in the fighting, arrested or fled.

In the 1961 Athens Classical Marathon, Abebe again won while running barefoot. This was the second and last event in which he competed barefooted. The same year he won the marathons in Osaka and Košice. While in Japan, he was approached by a Japanese shoe company, Onitsuka Tiger, with the possibility of wearing its shoes; they were informed by Niskanen that Abebe had &quot;other commitments&quot;. Kihachiro Onitsuka suspected that Abebe had a secret sponsorship deal with Puma, in spite of the now-abandoned rules against such deals.

Abebe ran the 1963 Boston Marathon—which was between his Olympic wins in 1960 and 1964—and finished fifth in 2:24:43. This was the only time in his competitive career that he completed an international marathon without winning. He and countryman Mamo Wolde, who finished 12th, had run together on record pace for 18 miles, until cold winds and the hills in Newton caused both to fall back. The race was won by Belgium&#x27;s Aurele Vandendriessche in a course record 2:18:58. Abebe returned to Ethiopia and did not compete in another marathon until 1964 in Addis Ababa. He won that race in a time of 2:23:14.8.

===1964 Tokyo Olympics===


Forty days before the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Abebe began to feel pain while training in Debre Zeit. He was brought to the hospital and diagnosed with acute appendicitis, and had an appendectomy on September 16. Back on his feet in a few days, Abebe left the hospital within a week.

He entered the October 21 marathon wearing Puma shoes. This was in contrast to the previous Olympics in Rome, where he ran barefoot. Abebe began the race right behind the lead pack until about the mark, when he slowly increased his pace. At , he was in third place behind Ron Clarke of Australia—who had been upset by Billy Mills in the 10,000 meters—and Jim Hogan of Ireland. Shortly before , Abebe took the lead; only Hogan was in contention, as Clarke began to slow. By , Abebe was almost two-and-a-half minutes in front of Hogan and Kokichi Tsuburaya of Japan was 17 seconds behind Hogan in third place. Hogan soon dropped out, exhausted, leaving only Tsuburaya three minutes behind Abebe by the mark.

Abebe entered the Olympic stadium alone, to the cheers of 75,000 spectators. The crowd had been listening on the radio and anticipated his triumphant entrance. Abebe finished with a time of 2:12:11.2, four minutes and eight seconds ahead of silver medallist Basil Heatley of Great Britain, who passed Tsuburaya inside the stadium. Tsuburaya was third, a few seconds behind Heatley. Abebe did not appear exhausted after the finish, and he again performed a routine of calisthenics, which included touching &quot;his toes twice then [lying] down on his back, cycling his legs in the air&quot;.

He was the first runner to successfully defend an Olympic marathon title. As of the 2024 Olympic marathon in Paris, Abebe, Waldemar Cierpinski, and Eliud Kipchoge are the only athletes to have won two gold medals in the event, and they all did it back-to-back. For the second time, Abebe received Ethiopia&#x27;s only gold medal and again returned home to a hero&#x27;s welcome. The Emperor promoted him to the commissioned-officer rank of &quot;metoaleqa&quot; (lieutenant). Abebe received the Order of Menelik II, a Volkswagen Beetle and a house.

===1965–1968===

On April 21, 1965, as part of the opening ceremonies for the second season of the 1964–1965 New York World&#x27;s Fair, Abebe and fellow athlete and Imperial Guardsman Mamo Wolde, ran a ceremonial half-marathon from the Arsenal in Central Park (at 64th Street and Fifth Avenue in Manhattan) to the Singer Bowl at the fair. They carried a parchment scroll with greetings from Haile Selassie.

The following month, Abebe returned to Japan and won his second Mainichi Marathon, held in Shiga Prefecture. In 1966 he ran marathons at Zarautz and Inchon–Seoul, winning both. The following year, Abebe did not finish the Zarautz International Marathon in July 1967. He had injured his hamstring, an injury from which he would never recover. Abebe had begun to limp, and the 1966 Incheon–Seoul Marathon was the last marathon he ever completed.

In July 1968, he travelled to Germany for treatment of &quot;circulatory ailments&quot; in his legs; the German government refused to accept payment for the medical services. Abebe returned in time to join the rest of the Ethiopian Olympic team training in Asmara, which has an altitude () and climate similar to Mexico City (the host of the next Olympic Games).

Seeking a third consecutive gold medal, Abebe entered the October 20 Olympic marathon with Mamo Wolde and Gebru Merawi. Symbolically, he was issued bib number 1 for the race. A week before the race, Abebe developed pain in his left leg. Doctors discovered a fracture in his fibula, and he was advised to stay off his feet until the day of the race. Abebe had to drop out of the race after approximately and Mamo Wolde won in 2:20:26.4. This was Abebe&#x27;s last marathon appearance. He was rewarded with a promotion to the rank of &quot;shambel&quot; (captain) upon his return to Ethiopia.

===Accident and death===
On the night of March 22, 1969, Abebe lost control of his Volkswagen Beetle and it overturned, trapping him inside. According to biographer Tim Judah, he may have been drinking. Judah quotes Abebe&#x27;s account of the accident from the biography by his daughter, Tsige Abebe, that he tried &quot;to avoid a fast, oncoming car&quot;. Judah wrote that it was difficult to know for certain what happened. Abebe was freed from his car the following morning and brought to the Imperial Guard hospital. The accident left him a quadriplegic, paralysed from the neck down; he never walked again. On March 29 Abebe was transferred to Stoke Mandeville Hospital in England, where he spent eight months receiving treatment. He was visited by Queen Elizabeth II and received get-well cards from all over the world. Although Abebe could not move his head at first, his condition eventually improved to paraplegia, regaining the use of his arms.

In 1970, Abebe began training for wheelchair-athlete archery competitions. In July, he competed in archery and table tennis at the Stoke Mandeville Wheelchair Games in London. The following April, Abebe participated in games for disabled people in Norway. Although he had been invited as a guest, he competed in archery and table tennis and defeated a field of sixteen in cross-country sled dog racing with a time of 1:16:17.

Abebe was invited to the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich as a special guest, and received a standing ovation during the opening ceremony. His countryman Mamo Wolde did not match his back-to-back Olympic marathon victories, finishing third behind Frank Shorter of the United States and Karel Lismont of Belgium. After Shorter received his gold medal, he shook Abebe&#x27;s hand.
On October 25, 1973, Abebe died in Addis Ababa at age 41 of a cerebral hemorrhage, a complication related to his accident four years earlier. He was buried with full military honours; his state funeral was attended by an estimated 65,000 people including Emperor Haile Selassie, who proclaimed a day of mourning for the country&#x27;s national hero. Abebe is interred in a tomb with a bronze statue at Saint Joseph Church in Addis Ababa.

== Legacy ==

Abebe began, and largely inspired, East African preeminence in long-distance running. According to Kenny Moore, a contemporary athlete and writer for &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, he began &quot;the great African distance running avalanche.&quot; Abebe brought to the forefront the now-accepted relationship between endurance and high-altitude training in all kinds of sports. Five years after his death, the New York Road Runners inaugurated the annual Abebe Bikila Award for contributions by an individual to long-distance running. East African recipients include Mamo Wolde, Juma Ikangaa, Tegla Loroupe, Paul Tergat, and Haile Gebrselassie.

He is a national hero in Ethiopia, and a stadium in Addis Ababa is named in his honour. In late 1972, the American Community School of Addis Ababa dedicated its gymnasium (which included facilities for disabled people) to Abebe.

On March 21, 2010, the Rome Marathon observed the 50th anniversary of his Olympic victory. The winner, Ethiopian runner Siraj Gena, ran the last of the race barefoot and received a €5,000 bonus. A plaque commemorating the anniversary is mounted on a wall on the Via di San Gregorio, and a footbridge in Ladispoli was named in Abebe&#x27;s honour.
According to Abebe&#x27;s &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary, Abebe and Yewebdar had three sons, along with their daughter Tsige. In 2010, the Italian company Vibram introduced the &quot;Bikila&quot; model of its FiveFingers line of minimalist shoes. In February 2015, Abebe&#x27;s surviving children Teferi, Tsige and Yetnayet Abebe Bikila, along with their mother, filed a lawsuit in United States federal court in Tacoma, Washington, claiming Vibram violated federal law and the state&#x27;s Personality Rights Act. The case was dismissed in October 2016 on the grounds that the plaintiffs were aware of Vibram&#x27;s use of the name in 2011, but did not file suit until four years later. According to judge Ronald Leighton, &quot;this unreasonable delay prejudiced Vibram.&quot;

It came to light in December 2019 that the family of Abebe received his Olympic ring that he lost at the Tokyo Olympic stadium&#x27;s bathroom. Abebe left his winning ring in a bathroom after he won the Olympic medal. A woman who was working in the bathroom at that time took it home with her. The woman has since died, but her son said his mom later regretted taking the ring and was waiting for an opportunity to return it. He gave the ring to Yetnayet, son of the late Abebe when Yetnayet came to Kasama City in Japan in December 2019 as a guest of honour for the half marathon competition conducted in honour of his father.

== In popular culture ==

Abebe has been featured in several documentaries about his life and the Olympics in general. His victory at the 1964 Olympics was featured in the 1965 documentary, &quot;Tokyo Olympiad&quot; directed by Kon Ichikawa. Footage from that film was recycled in the 1976 thriller, &quot;Marathon Man&quot; directed by John Schlesinger and starring Dustin Hoffman. Abebe was the subject of Bud Greenspan&#x27;s 1972 documentary, &quot;The Ethiopians&quot;. The documentary was incorporated into &quot;The Marathon&quot;, a 1976 episode of Greenspan&#x27;s &quot;The Olympiad&quot; television documentary series. &quot;The Marathon&quot;, which chronicles Abebe&#x27;s two Olympic victories, ends with a dedication ceremony for a gymnasium named in Abebe&#x27;s honour shortly before his death.

In 1992, Yamada Kazuhiro published the first full biography about Abebe, written in Japanese and published in Tokyo; it was entitled &quot;Do You Remember Abebe?&quot; (). Since then, there have been at least three biographical works based on his life. Among these is &quot;Triumph and Tragedy&quot;, written in English by his daughter Tsige Abebe and published in Addis Ababa in 1996. The other two, also written in English, are Paul Rambali&#x27;s 2007 fictional biographical novel &quot;Barefoot Runner&quot; and Tim Judah&#x27;s 2009 &quot;Bikila: Ethiopia&#x27;s Barefoot Olympian&quot;. According to the journalist Tim Lewis&#x27;s comparative review of the two books, Judah&#x27;s is a more journalistic, less-forgiving biography of Abebe. It refutes the mythical aspects of his life but recognises Abebe&#x27;s athletic accomplishments. Judah&#x27;s account of Abebe&#x27;s life differs significantly from Rambali&#x27;s, but confirms (and frequently cites) Tsige&#x27;s biography. For example, Lewis cites the discrepancy in the circumstances surrounding Abebe&#x27;s car accident:

Abebe is also the subject of a 2009 feature film, &quot;Atletu&quot; (&quot;The Athlete&quot;), directed by Davey Frankel and Rasselas Lakew. The film starring Rasselas focuses on the final years of Abebe&#x27;s life: his quest to regain the Olympic title, the accident and his struggle to compete again.

Robin Williams referred to Abebe&#x27;s barefoot running during his 2009 stand-up comedy tour, Weapons of Self-Destruction: &quot;[Abebe] won the Rome Olympics running barefoot. He was then sponsored by Adidas. He ran the next Olympics; he carried the fucking shoes&quot;. Abebe did not carry his shoes but wore them; he was not sponsored by Adidas but was perhaps secretly sponsored by Puma.

<text>Laurier—Sainte-Marie () is a federal electoral district in Downtown Montreal, Quebec, Canada, which has been represented in the House of Commons since 1988. Its 2016 population was 111,835.

Since 2019, its Member of Parliament (MP) has been Steven Guilbeault of the Liberal Party.

==Geography==
The district includes Côte Saint-Louis and the eastern parts of The Plateau and Mile End in the Borough of Le Plateau-Mont-Royal and the eastern part of Downtown Montreal and the western part of Centre-Sud (including part of the neighbourhood of Sainte-Marie) in the Borough of Ville-Marie.

==History==
In 1987, the district of &quot;Laurier—Sainte-Marie&quot; was created from Laurier, Montreal—Sainte-Marie and Saint-Jacques ridings.

In 2003, Laurier—Sainte-Marie was abolished when it was redistributed into Laurier and Hochelaga ridings.

After the 2004 election, Laurier riding was renamed &quot;Laurier—Sainte-Marie&quot; in 2004.

The name comes from Laurier Avenue, a street in Plateau Mont-Royal named after Wilfrid Laurier, and Sainte-Marie, a former name for Centre-Sud, which in turn came from a parish church dedicated to Saint Mary.

The riding was represented by Gilles Duceppe, leader of the Bloc Québécois, until 2011 when he was defeated by Hélène Laverdière of the New Democratic Party.

This riding lost territory to Outremont and Ville-Marie—Le Sud-Ouest—Île-des-Sœurs, and gained territory from Hochelaga, Westmount—Ville-Marie and Outremont during the 2012 electoral redistribution.

<text>Mount Shuksan is a glaciated massif in the North Cascades National Park. Shuksan rises in Whatcom County, Washington immediately to the east of Mount Baker, and south of the Canada–US border. The mountain&#x27;s name &quot;Shuksan&quot; is derived from the Lummi word &quot;[šéqsən]&quot;, said to mean &quot;high peak&quot;. The highest point on the mountain is a three-sided peak known as Summit Pyramid.

The mountain is composed of Shuksan greenschist, oceanic basalt that was metamorphosed when the Easton terrane collided with the west coast of North America, approximately 120 million years ago. The mountain is an eroded remnant of a thrust plate formed by the Easton collision.

The Mount Baker Highway, State Route 542, is kept open during the winter to support Mt. Baker Ski Area. In late summer, the road to Artist Point allows visitors to travel a few miles higher for a closer view of the peak. Picture Lake is accessible on the highway and reflects the mountain, making it a popular site for photography.

Sulphide Creek Falls, one of the tallest waterfalls in North America, plunges off the southeastern flank of Mount Shuksan. There are four other tall waterfalls that spill off Mount Shuksan and neighboring Jagged Ridge and Seahpo Peak, mostly sourced from small snowfields and glaciers.

The traditional name of Mount Shuksan in the Nooksack language is &quot;Shéqsan&quot; (&quot;high foot&quot;) or &quot;Ch’ésqen&quot; (&quot;golden eagle&quot;). Both the Nooksack and Lummi are indigenous tribes who have occupied the watersheds of the Nooksack Rivers and Lummi River, respectively. They are both federally recognized tribes in the United States.

The first ascent of Mount Shuksan is usually attributed to Asahel Curtis and W. Montelius Price on September 7, 1906. However, in a 1907 letter to the editor of the Mazamas club journal, C. E. Rusk attributed the first ascent to Joseph Morowits in 1897. He said that he himself would have attempted it in 1903 if he had not been sure that it had already been climbed.

<doc id="671303" wikidata="Q4865244" url="?curid=671303" title="Green-backed camaroptera">
<text>The green-backed camaroptera (Camaroptera brachyura), also known as the bleating camaroptera, is a small bird in the family Cisticolidae. This bird is a resident breeder in Africa south of the Sahara Desert. Recent studies suggest this species and the grey-backed camaroptera may be the same species.

This skulking passerine is typically found low in dense cover. The green-backed camaroptera binds large leaves together low in a bush and builds a grass nest within the leaves. The normal clutch is two or three eggs.

These 11.5 cm long warblers have green upperparts. The wings are olive and the underparts whitish grey. The sexes are similar, but juveniles are paler yellow on the breast.

Like most members in the group, green-backed camaroptera is insectivorous.

The green-backed camaroptera was described by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1821 under the binomial name &quot;Sylvia brachyura&quot;. The type locality is the Cape of Good Hope. The specific epithet &quot;brachyura&quot; is from the Ancient Greek &quot;brakhus&quot; for &quot;short&quot; and &quot;-ouros&quot; for &quot;-tailed&quot;.

There are five subspecies:
* &quot;C. b. pileata&quot; Reichenow, 1891 – southeast Kenya to southeast Tanzania
* &quot;C. b. fugglescouchmani&quot; Moreau, 1939 – northeast Zambia, north Malawi and east Tanzania
* &quot;C. b. bororensis&quot; Gunning &amp; Roberts, 1911 – south Tanzania, south Malawi and north Mozambique
* &quot;C. b. constans&quot; Clancey, 1952 – southeast Zimbabwe, south Mozambique and northeast South Africa
* &quot;C. b. brachyura&quot; (Vieillot, 1821) – south and east South Africa

<doc id="671304" wikidata="Q257617" url="?curid=671304" title="Tatoi Palace">
<text>Tatoi (, ) was the summer palace and estate of the former Greek royal family. The area is a densely wooded southeast-facing slope of Mount Parnitha, and its ancient and current official name is Dekeleia. It is located  from the city centre of Athens and from Kifissia.

==Development of the estate and ownership disputes==
King George I purchased the estate in 1872, purchasing it with private funds he had brought from Denmark. 

In July 1916, an arson attack ravaged Tatoi Palace. The royal family barely escaped the flames. Among the palace personnel and firefighters who arrived to deal with the blaze, sixteen people were killed.

During the Republican regime in the 1920s, most of the estate was confiscated from its owners. Around 1929-1930 the government allowed Dimitrios Gaziadis to film the movie &quot;The Apaches of Athens (1930)&quot; at the lavish estate. In 1936, it was returned to King George II of the Hellenes following the monarchy&#x27;s restoration.

During the Second World War, when the King was in exile and Greeks suffered considerable hardships under German occupation, the woods at Tatoi were chopped down for fuel and corpses were buried in shallow graves.

King George II regained possession of the estate in 1946. It passed down as private property to King Constantine II until 1994, when the royal estates were confiscated by the government of Andreas Papandreou. 

In 1973, the property was abandoned completely. Lack of funding resulted in the cows and horses dying of starvation in the stables. The buildings were subject to vandalism and looting, resulting in significant losses. A former cowshed was filled with objects from Rododafni Castle, the mansion at Psychico, Mon Repos palace, and other royal residences. With permission of the Government, in 1993, the ex-King was able to remove nine cargo crates of objects: some of this appeared at auction at Christies in 2007. There remained 17,000 objects, including antiquities, old masters, and a life-size portrait of Queen Anne-Marie that are now in storage at the Ministry of Culture.

==Restoration and reopening==
In June 2007, the Government of Greece said it intended to turn the former palace and grounds into a museum. However, it was reported in September 2012 that the government now intended to sell the palace and its estate in the face of mounting financial pressure. Founded in 2012, the &quot;Friends of Tatoi Association&quot; has set itself the goal to restore the former royal estate and convert it to a museum and public venue, while facing political indifference and lack of money.

In 2015, ten cars which were kept in the former royal estate of Tatoi, were designated as cultural monuments by the Central Council for Modern Monuments (ΚΣΝΜ). However, the cars, as well as the carriages (which were not included in the decision) remained in the ruins, with parts of the roof falling on the cars in 2016. However, as of 2020, the cars and carriages have now been removed and restored as part of greater restoration efforts by the Greek government.

For several years, the Greek government had no planned efforts for preservation of the Tatoi Palace, neighbouring buildings and the natural area around the Tatoi, and the estate suffered from extensive age and weather damage. The Greek state had renamed the area as &quot;metropolitan area&quot;. A political idea to convert the former royal estate to a private winery or a resort with restaurants and barbecue was met with criticism by private persons and organisations, who feared it could erase the historical elements of the property, and who preferred to open Tatoi as a museum for the public. The former royal estate of Polydendri forest is also completely abandoned, and the buildings are in a state of decay.

In late 2019, the Greek culture ministry moved ahead with plans to finally restore the palace. After approximately a year of conservation work had been undertaken, the Greek government announced that the estate would become a mixed-use development after the completion of restoration. Plans are centered on the conversion of the main house into a museum of the royal family, as well as the construction of a new luxury hotel and spa. The 2021 forest fires were catastrophic for the estate: were burnt, with a fire breaking out in the Palace itself. While it was saved, two adjoining storage containers containing objects were destroyed. The area of the Royal Cemetery burned, but the Mausoleum and the Church of the Resurrection were saved. A number of estate buildings, including the Directorate building (which was being used to store furniture), the caretaker&#x27;s house, the Telegraph Office and Sturm House, were lost. 

Following the death and funeral of Constantine II, it was announced by Lina Mendoni, the Minister of Culture and Sports, that the government intended to have Tatoi transformed into a museum by 2025. Points of interest are renovating the exterior and tidying up the royal gardens. The project comes following clean-up crews&#x27; efforts to clean Tatoi Palace and its surroundings for the burial of Constantine II. The forest started recovering by 2024 and plans were announced for the restoration of the palace gardens. The renovations are expected to be completed by late 2025.

<doc id="671308" wikidata="Q5429265" url="?curid=671308" title="Senegal eremomela">
<text>The Senegal eremomela (Eremomela pusilla) is a member of the African warbler family, the Cisticolidae. It occurs in the savannas of western Sub-Saharan Africa.

==Taxonomy==
The Senegal eremomela was described by the German ornithologist Gustav Hartlaub in 1857 and given its current binomial name &quot;Eremomela pusilla&quot;. The type locality is Senegal. The species has been treated as conspecific with the green-backed eremomela, as they hybridizes in a narrow zone of sympatry along the Cameroon-Central African Republic border.

==Description==
The Senegal eremomela is a small bird with a pale brownish grey head and a pale white supercilium. The back and mantle are green, becoming a brighter yellowish green on the rump, the throat and upper breast are white becoming bright lemon yellow on the lower breast, belly and vent. Blackish bill with a pale lower mandible and pale brownish legs.

===Voice===
The territorial call is a rarely heard harsh and rapid chattering. It trills constantly when foraging. It joins the morning chorus with a dull monotonous and rhythmic &quot;whup-whup-whup&quot; sand from a perch before and at the start of the breeding season.

==Distribution==
Western Africa from extreme southern Mauritania and Senegal to north western Cameroon, south-western Chad and far north-western Central African Republic.

==Habits and habitat==
The Senegal eremomela occurs in small parties which actively forage in wooded savanna, cultivated areas and orchards. It is arboreal and insectivorous feeding on ants, beetles, caterpillars and other larvae, as well as some fruit. It breeds in the first half of the year in the west, although egg laying has been recorded as late as October in the Ivory Coast.

<doc id="671317" wikidata="Q5598301" url="?curid=671317" title="Graydon Carter">
<text>Edward Graydon Carter, CM (born July 14, 1949) is a Canadian journalist who served as the editor of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; from 1992 until 2017. He also co-founded, with Kurt Andersen and Tom Phillips, the satirical monthly magazine &quot;Spy&quot; in 1986. In 2019, he co-launched a weekly newsletter with Alessandra Stanley called &quot;Air Mail&quot;, which is for &quot;worldly cosmopolitans&quot;.

==Career==
After high school in Trenton, Ontario, Carter attended the University of Ottawa followed by Carleton University, but never graduated from either school. In 1973, Carter co-founded &quot;The Canadian Review&quot;, a monthly general interest magazine. By 1977, &quot;The Canadian Review&quot; had become award-winning and the third-largest circulating magazine in Canada. Despite its success, &quot;The Canadian Review&quot; was bankrupt by 1978.

In 1978, Carter moved to the United States and began working for &quot;Time&quot; as a writer-trainee, where he met Kurt Andersen. Carter spent five years writing for &quot;Time&quot; on the topics of business, law, and entertainment before moving to &quot;Life&quot; in 1983. In 1986, Carter and Andersen founded &quot;Spy&quot;, which ran for 12 years before it ultimately ceased publication in 1998. Carter was then editor at &quot;The New York Observer&quot; before being invited by &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; to take over for Tina Brown, who left for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. He was the editor from July 1992 until late in 2017. Accolades during his tenure include his having won 14 National Magazine Awards and being named to the Magazine Editors&#x27; Hall of Fame.

Carter is the author of &quot;What We&#x27;ve Lost&quot; (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, September 2004), a comprehensive critical examination of the Bush administration.
Carter&#x27;s &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; combined high-profile celebrity cover stories with serious journalism. His often idiosyncratic personal style was depicted in &quot;How to Lose Friends &amp; Alienate People&quot;, a book by former &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; contributing editor Toby Young. Jeff Bridges played a character based on Carter in the 2008 film adaptation.

Carter was a producer of &quot;I&#x27;ll Eat You Last&quot;, a one-woman play starring Bette Midler, about legendary Hollywood talent agent Sue Mengers. The show, directed by Tony Award-winner Joe Mantello, opened at the Booth Theatre in New York City in April 2013, and at the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles on December 3.

Carter has co-produced two documentaries for HBO, &quot;Public Speaking&quot; (2010), directed by Martin Scorsese, which spotlights writer Fran Lebowitz, and &quot;His Way&quot; (2011), about Hollywood producer Jerry Weintraub, which was nominated for a Primetime Emmy. He also was a producer of &quot;Chicago 10&quot;, a documentary which premiered on the opening night of the Sundance Film Festival in early 2007. He was also a producer of &quot;Surfwise&quot;, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2007, and &quot;&quot;, a biographical documentary of Hunter S. Thompson directed by Alex Gibney.

Carter was an executive producer of &quot;9/11&quot;, a film by Jules and Gedeon Naudet about the September 11 terrorist attacks, which aired on CBS. Carter received an Emmy Award for &quot;9/11&quot;, as well as a Peabody Award. He also produced the documentary adaptation of the book &quot;The Kid Stays in the Picture&quot;, about the legendary Hollywood producer Robert Evans. It premiered at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival, screened at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival and opened in theaters in July of that year. In 2012, Carter had a minor role in &quot;Arbitrage&quot;.

In 2017, he was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada by Governor General David Johnston for &quot;contributions to popular culture and current affairs as a skilled editor and publisher&quot;.

On September 7, 2017, Carter announced his departure from the editorship of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. He was on gardening leave until the end of 2017.

In 2019, Carter co-launched a weekly newsletter with Alessandra Stanley called &quot;Air Mail&quot;.

=== Jeffrey Epstein allegations ===
In 2003, Carter assigned &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; journalist Vicky Ward to write a profile of financier Jeffrey Epstein. During the course of her reporting, Ward became aware of sex abuse and trafficking allegations against Epstein, later stating that almost all of her sources mentioned &quot;the girls, as an aside&quot;. In her 2015 article for &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, &quot;I Tried to Warn You About Sleazy Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein in 2003&quot;, written following Epstein&#x27;s conviction in Florida, Ward revealed that she had interviewed the family of two young sisters (later identified as Annie and Maria Farmer) and discovered credible reports of molestation against Epstein, but according to Ward, the allegations were removed from the piece by then-editor Carter:&quot;It came down to my sources&#x27; word against Epstein&#x27;s... and at the time Graydon believed Epstein. In my notebook I have him saying, &#x27;I believe him... I&#x27;m Canadian.

==Personal life==

Carter was born in Toronto. He has been married three times. His first wife was a Canadian; the marriage was dissolved before Carter moved to the United States at the age of 28. His second marriage to Cynthia Williamson lasted 18 years and they had four children. The couple divorced in 2000. Carter married Anna Scott in 2005. They have a daughter.

President of the United States Donald Trump has criticized him on Twitter, attacking his restaurant and tenure at &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;.

Carter splits his time between Greenwich Village and Roxbury, Connecticut, where he works &quot;from a sun-drenched studio that occupies the top floor of the detached barn and looks onto a garden and the serene hills beyond.&quot; He is a co-owner of The Waverly Inn at 16 Bank Street in the West Village.

In 2009 Carter and Jeff Klein became partners in the Monkey Bar, a New York City bar and restaurant eatery with a history dating to 1936. Both men sold their interest in the property in 2020.

In 2003, Carter described himself as &quot;very much a libertarian.&quot;

<text>Cabot, Cabot &amp; Forbes (CC&amp;F) is a real estate development firm in Alewife, Massachusetts. It was founded by Francis Murray Forbes of the Boston Brahmin Forbes family in 1897 as a real estate management firm. Jay Doherty purchased the company in 2004 from its previous owners, the Marshall Field Family and is serving as the present CEO of the firm.

==History==

The firm was founded in 1897 by two members of Boston&#x27;s Cabot family and F. Murray Forbes, originally to manage the real estate assets of the two families. In the 1940s, CC&amp;F started developing industrial parks.

In 1948, the firm developed the 300-acre New England Industrial Center in Needham, Massachusetts.

In the early 1950s, the firm entered the real estate development business, led by Alexander C. Forbes and Gerald W. Blakeley Jr. In 1956, the firm was bought by Blakely.

In 1979, it was bought by Field Enterprises, whose ownership passed to Marshall Field V in 1984.

In 1959, CC&amp;F partnered with Paine Webber to form the Laguna Niguel Corporation, which developed Laguna Niguel, one of California&#x27;s first master planned communities. Cabot Road and Forbes Road in Laguna Hills and Laguna Niguel is named after the firm.

As of 1987, CC&amp;F owned 15 million square feet of industrial and office space in 20 states.

In May 2014, CC&amp;F and Boston Andes Capital purchased a two-acre site across from the Quincy Adams subway station in Quincy, Massachusetts, for $10.3 million, planning to build 180 apartments., a project they completed in 2016.

In November 2017, the firm purchased the locally well-known site of Boston Cab for $51 million.

In 2020, CC&amp;F completed a $300 million redevelopment project to rebuild the St. Gabriel’s Monastery in Brighton as 555 luxury apartments.

From 1960 to the first few years of the new millennium, Cabot, Cabot &amp; Forbes had developed more than 60 million square feet of commercial space across the country, including doing master planning for more than 100 industrial and office parks.

Among notable American business leaders who have worked at the firm: Mortimer Zuckerman (1962-1970), Gerald Blakeley, Edward H. Linde, and Charles H. Spaulding (founder of Spaulding &amp; Slye).

==Westwood Station==

In 2006, Cabot, Cabot and Forbes and partner Commonfund Realty Inc., announced the conceived Westwood Station, a 150-acre mixed-use community of office buildings, retail stores and luxury condominiums, located near Route 128 and the MBTA rail station in Westwood, Massachusetts, with an estimated cost of $1.5 billion. The original project planning included 1.5 million square feet of office buildings, 1.35 million square feet of retail, one thousand residential units and two hotels. Over the following years, the developers failed to find financing for the project, facing different problems, and affected by the credit market crash of late 2008.

In 2009, the developers announced halting the project as they were unable to secure a construction loan for the first phase, which was a planned 1.7 million square feet of land, at a $700 million estimated cost.

In September 2010, the Dublin-based Anglo Irish Bank, the project&#x27;s primary lender, pushed to exit the deal. On October, the Woburn-based Eastern Real Estate LLC bought the project.

In 2013, Cabot, Cabot and Forbes sold the property to New England Development for $45 million. Following the selling, the project changed into the University Station, less than half size of the original project. It was opened in 2015.

<text>Kurt B. Andersen (born August 22, 1954) is an American writer, the author of novels and nonfiction as well as a writer for television and the theater.

He was also a co-founder of &quot;Spy&quot; magazine, as well as co-creator and for its 20-year run host of the weekly Peabody Award-winning public radio program and podcast &quot;Studio 360&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Andersen was born in Omaha, Nebraska. Growing up, he lived across the street from Ginni Thomas. He graduated from Westside High School. While a student at Harvard College, he was an editor and vice-president of the &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot;. He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard.

==Journalism==
In 1986, with E. Graydon Carter and Thomas L. Phillips Jr., he co-founded &quot;Spy&quot;. In &quot;Spy&quot;, Andersen and Carter in 1988 coined the notable epithet &quot;short-fingered vulgarian Donald Trump&quot; for the future U.S. president.

&quot;It&#x27;s pretty safe to say,&quot; author Dave Eggers wrote in the mid-1990s, &quot;that &quot;Spy&quot; was the most influential magazine of the 1980s. It might have remade New York&#x27;s cultural landscape; it definitely changed the whole tone of magazine journalism. It was cruel, brilliant, beautifully written and perfectly designed, and feared by all. There&#x27;s no magazine I know of that&#x27;s so continually referenced, held up as a benchmark; and whose demise is so lamented.&quot; In 2006, novelist Christopher Buckley wrote that &quot;&quot;Spy&quot; didn&#x27;t capture the zeitgeist — it was the zeitgeist,&quot; that it was &quot;deliciously vicious&quot; and &quot;despised by all the right people, primus inter pares, Donald Trump.&quot; Media critic Jack Shafer wrote in 2009 that &quot;Spy&quot; was one of &quot;a handful of 20th-century American magazines...whose glory days continue to influence editors.&quot; And in a 2017 paper about &quot;Spy&quot;, Marist College journalism professor and department chair Kevin M. Lerner wrote that &quot;a whole generation of journalists was raised with the &quot;Spy&quot; attitude ingrained not just into their writing but into their world view,&quot; and that &quot;more than anything, &quot;Spy&quot; invented the painstakingly reported – but still funny – satirical magazine feature. It was as funny as &quot;Mad&quot;, and as well-reported as &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.&quot;

Andersen co-wrote and co-produced two hour-long prime-time &quot;Spy&quot; specials for NBC, in 1991 &quot;Spy Magazine Presents How to Be Famous&quot;, hosted by Jerry Seinfeld, and &quot;The Spy Magazine Hit List: The 100 Most Annoying and Alarming People and Events of 1992&quot;, hosted by Julia Louis-Dreyfus. Andersen and his partners sold &quot;Spy&quot; in 1991, and he left the magazine in 1993; it continued publishing until 1998.

Earlier, Andersen had worked as a writer for the &quot;Today Show&quot; critic and interviewer Gene Shalit. Before, during and after &quot;Spy&quot;, he wrote for &quot;Time&quot;, including nine years as its architecture and design critic. From 1996 to 1999 he was a staff writer and columnist (&quot;The Culture Industry&quot;) for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, and from 2004 to 2008 a columnist for &quot;New York&quot; (&quot;The Imperial City&quot;).

After he became editor-in-chief of &quot;New York&quot; in 1994, its circulation and advertising revenue quickly rose. In early 1996, according to a &quot;New York Times&quot; article quoting Andersen, Henry Kravis, the head of KKR, the financial firm that controlled &quot;New York&quot;&#x27;s publishing company, asked him to kill a story about a rivalry between Felix Rohatyn and Steven Rattner for control of the Lazard investment bank, and to stop covering Wall Street altogether. Andersen demurred, and was fired five months later.

In 1999, he co-founded an online media and entertainment news website and biweekly magazine &quot;Inside&quot;. In 2001, he and his co-founders merged &quot;Inside&quot; with a site and magazine founded by Steven Brill. The merged enterprise was subsequently acquired by Primedia, but Primedia closed the Brill site in October 2001, and later &quot;Inside&quot; as well.

From 2001 to 2004, Andersen served as a senior creative consultant to Barry Diller&#x27;s Universal Television, where he co-created the entertainment and arts channel Trio with Michael Jackson, Lauren Zalaznick and Andy Cohen. From 2003 to 2005 he was editorial director of &quot;Colors&quot; magazine, and in 2006, with his former colleague Jackson and Bonnie Siegler (and Diller&#x27;s IAC) co-founded the daily email cultural curation service Very Short List. In 2007 and 2008 he was an editor-at-large for Random House, and in 2011 a guest op-ed columnist for &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

He had co-created &quot;Studio 360&quot;, a weekly program covering the arts and culture, which he hosted from its launch in 1999 to its last episode in 2020. Originally a co-production of Public Radio International and WNYC, it was broadcast on 240 U.S. public radio stations to a weekly audience of more than 500,000 radio listeners, with an additional podcast audience during the 2010s. In 2005 it won a Peabody Award for an hour-long documentary about &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, the first of its 17 American Icons hours, each exploring one cultural work––including &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot;, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, Monticello, and Disneyland and EPCOT. &quot;Studio 360&quot; remains available as a podcast.

In 2021 he co-produced, wrote and narrated &quot;Nixon At War,&quot; a seven-episode podcast about how Richard Nixon&#x27;s responses to the Vietnam War resulted in his downfall and ultimately the contemporary polarization of U.S. society. The podcast, funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities and distributed by PRX/Public Radio Exchange, was drawn from hundreds of archival recordings unearthed from the Nixon and Lyndon Johnson presidencies.

==Literary works==
Andersen is the author of four novels. His first was &quot;Turn of the Century&quot; (Random House, 1999), which was a national bestseller and &quot;New York Times&quot; Notable Book of the Year. &quot;Heyday&quot; (Random House, 2007) was also a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller, and won the Langum Prize for the best American historical novel of 2007. &quot;True Believers&quot; (Random House, 2012) was named one of the best novels of that year by the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; and the &quot;Washington Post&quot;. His most recent novel, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Spell America Without Me: The Really Tremendous Inside Story of My Fantastic First Year As President&quot; (Penguin, 2017) is a fictional memoir &quot;by&quot; Donald Trump co-authored by Andersen with Alec Baldwin. It was a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller. Andersen&#x27;s short fiction has been published in anthologies such as Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;Stories: All-New Tales&quot; (HarperCollins, 2010).

Andersen&#x27;s first book was a collection of humorous essays, &quot;The Real Thing&quot; (Doubleday, 1980; Holt, 1982; Bison Press, 2008), around the idea of &quot;quintessentialism&quot;, and he co-authored two humor books, &quot;Tools of Power&quot; (Viking, 1980), a parody of self-help books on becoming successful, and &quot;Loose Lips&quot; (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995), an anthology of edited transcripts of real-life conversations involving celebrated people; it was based on an off-Broadway play of the same name that he created with Lisa Birnbach and Jamie Malanowski. Along with Carter and George Kalogerakis, Andersen wrote and assembled a history and greatest-hits anthology of &quot;Spy&quot; called &quot;Spy: The Funny Years&quot;, published in 2006 by Miramax Books.

He also wrote &quot;Reset&quot; (Random House, 2009), an essay about the causes and aftermath of the Great Recession, and he has contributed to many other books, such as &quot;Spark: How Creativity Works&quot; (HarperCollins, 2011), drawn from his interviews for &quot;Studio 360&quot;, an introduction to Heinrich Boll&#x27;s novel &quot;The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum&quot; (Peinguin, 2010), and &quot;Fields of Vision: The Photographs of John Vachon&quot; (Library of Congress, 2010).

In 2017, he published &quot;&quot;, which explains American society&#x27;s peculiar susceptibility to falsehoods and illusions, and how that eventually led to Trump&#x27;s election and the transformation of the Republican Party and the right in general. (Random House) Excerpts from &quot;Fantasyland&quot; appeared as a cover story in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, and in &quot;Slate.&quot; 
&quot;Fantasyland,&quot; which the &quot;Times Book Review&quot; called &quot;a great revisionist history of America,&quot; reached #3 on the &quot;New York Times&quot; nonfiction bestseller list.

In August 2020, he published &quot;Evil Geniuses: The Unmaking of America&quot;, another &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller that Andersen described as a &quot;companion&quot; to &quot;Fantasyland&quot;, a &quot;de facto volume two in my history of the fuckening of America.&quot; &quot;Evil Geniuses&quot; examines the coordinated efforts to achieve conservative economic and political changes in the United States from the 1970s through 2020, and discusses how the resulting unfettered laissez-faire approach to capitalism has produced an extreme level of economic inequality and disempowered majority.

The film director Steven Soderbergh initiated conversations with Andersen about &quot;Evil Geniuses&quot; when it was published, which led to the two of them co-creating &quot;Command Z&quot;, a satirical sci-fi series starring Michael Cera, Liev Schreiber and Roy Wood Jr. Soderbergh directed the eight episodes, which were released in July 2023 on his web site; all proceeds are going to charity.

==Personal life==
Andersen lives in New York City with his wife, author Anne Kreamer. They have two daughters, Katherine Kreamer Andersen and Lucy Kreamer Andersen.

<doc id="671331" wikidata="Q957317" url="?curid=671331" title="Exposition Universelle (1889)">
<text>The of 1889 (), better known in English as the 1889 Paris Exposition, was a world&#x27;s fair held in Paris, France, from 6 May to 31 October 1889. It was the fifth of ten major expositions held in the city between 1855 and 1937. It attracted more than thirty-two million visitors. The most famous structure created for the exposition, and still remaining, is the Eiffel Tower.

== Organization ==
The exposition was held to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Storming of the Bastille, which marked the beginning of French Revolution, and was also seen as a way to stimulate the economy and pull France out of an economic recession. The exposition attracted 61,722 official exhibitors, of whom twenty-five thousand were from outside of France.

== Admission price ==
Admission to the exposition cost forty centimes, at a time when the price of an &quot;economy&quot; plate of meat and vegetables in a Paris cafe was ten centimes. Visitors paid an additional price for several of the exposition&#x27;s most popular attractions. Climbing the Eiffel Tower cost five Francs; admission to the popular panoramas, theatres and concerts was one franc. Visitors from the French provinces could buy a ticket which included the train fare and entry into the exposition. The total cost of exposition was 41,500,000 francs, while income was 49,500,000 francs. It was the last of the Paris world&#x27;s fairs to make a profit.

== National participation and boycotts ==
The countries that officially participated in the exposition were Andorra, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, the United States, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Hawaii, Honduras, India, Japan, Morocco, Mexico, Monaco, Nicaragua, Norway, Paraguay, Persia, Saint-Martin, El Salvador, Serbia, Siam, the South African Republic, Switzerland, Uruguay and Venezuela. The British dominions of New Zealand and Tasmania also took part.

Because of the theme of the exposition, celebrating the overthrow of the French monarchy, nearly all European countries with monarchies officially boycotted the exposition. The boycotting nations were Germany, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Russia and Sweden.

Nonetheless, many citizens and companies from those countries participated, and a number of countries had their participation entirely funded by private sponsors. They included Germany and Alsace-Lorraine, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Brazil, China, Denmark, Egypt, Spain, the United Kingdom and its colonies, Haiti, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Peru, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Finland and Sweden.

== Exposition sites ==
The exposition occupied two large sites. The main site was on Champs de Mars on the Left Bank, which had been the parade ground of the Ecole Militaire, and had been occupied by the 1878 Universal Exposition. This was the site of the major part of the exposition, including the Eiffel Tower, Palace of Machines, and the Palaces of Fine Arts and Liberal Arts. The exposition extended across the Seine to the right bank, to the Trocadero Palace, which had been built on the heights for the 1878 Exposition. The slope from the Trocadero Palace down to the Seine was filled with terrace, fountains, gardens and horticultural exhibits.

A separate, smaller site was located on the esplanade of Les Invalides, which hosted the pavilions of the French colonies. This section featured a large assortment of outdoor restaurants and cafes with foods from Indochina, North Africa, and other cuisines from around the world. The colonial pavilions conveyed the multiculturalism of France&#x27;s colonies, the largest of them being the Palais Central des Colonies, designed by Stephen Sauvestre, who notably contributed to the design of the Eiffel Tower. In addition to the architectural displays of France&#x27;s colonies, the exposition showcased a construction of villages inhabited by natives of the colonies, to be observed by viewers. The colonized people had their daily lives displayed for the exposition visitors, which made some of them uncomfortable. Samba Lawbé Thiam, a jeweler from Senegal who was part of the 1889 Exposition, said the following:

&quot;We are very humiliated to be exhibited this way, in huts like savages; these straw and mud huts do not give an idea of Senegal. In Senegal ... we have large buildings, railroad stations, railroads; we light them with electricity. The Bureau of Hygiene does not tolerate the construction of this type of hovel. Those [existing ones] that fall into disrepair are not replaced.&quot;

The incorporation of indigenous colonized individuals in the exposition was intended to be an educational element, but has also historically been framed as an exploitative and patronizing display of colonized people without their consent.

This colonial section of the exposition was linked to the Champs de Mars site by a corridor of pavilions along the left Bank. This corridor, at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, also featured a display called &quot;The History of Human Habitation&quot;, with model houses depicting the history of domestic architecture, designed with much imagination by Charles Garnier, architect of the Paris Opera.

There were twenty-two different entrances to the exposition, around its perimeter. They were open from 8 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. for the major exhibits and palaces, and until 11:00 in the evening for the illuminated greens and restaurants. The major ceremonial entrance was located at Les Invalides consisting of two tall pylons with colorful ornament, like giant candelabras.

== Views of the Exposition ==
== Structures ==
=== The Eiffel Tower ===
The Eiffel Tower, built especially for the exposition, was the tallest structure in the world at the time. A competition to build what was simply called &quot;A tower of three hundred meters&quot; with a base one hundred meters wide, was announced in 1886. It was won by the construction firm of Gustave Eiffel, which had recently built the iron frame of the Statue of Liberty. The Eiffel firm had advance knowledge of the project and, beginning in 1884, had already designed a tower exactly to those dimensions. The structural design was created by two Eiffel engineers, Maurice Koechlin and Émile Nouguier, who along with Eiffel himself, received the patent for the plan. An Eiffel architect, Stephen Sauvestre, designed the curving form and decoration which gave the tower its distinctive appearance. Eiffel was granted exclusive rights for twenty years to operate the tower and its restaurants and viewing platforms. A site next to the River was chosen, despite the infiltration of river water, since that land was owned by the City of Paris, and the tower could be kept in place after the exposition was completed.

The construction lasted two years, two months and five days, and involved five hundred workers, who assembled eighteen thousand iron pieces, each of five meters and carefully numbered, which had been made at a factory in Levallois-Perret, a Paris suburb. Speaking of the tower construction workers, the son-in-law of Eiffel, declared, &quot;no soldier on the battle field deserved better mention than these humble toilers, who, will never go down in history.&quot; During the exposition, no one other than construction personnel were allowed higher than the second viewing platform.

In the first week of the exposition, 29,922 persons climbed the tower to the viewing platform, though the elevators were not yet in service, and they had to climb by a narrow winding stairway. By the time the exposition finished, after 173 days, 1,968,287 persons had ascended the tower.

When the exposition ended, the tower was used for a time as a weather station. In 1904, Eiffel proposed to the French military that a radio transmitter, designed by the pioneer radio engineer Edouard Branly, be placed on the third level. In 1909, when Eiffel&#x27;s concession formally ended, it was decided to preserve the Tower permanently.
=== The Gallery of Machines ===
A second monumental building on the site was the Galerie des machines, by the architect Ferdinand Dutert and engineer Victor Contamin, which had originally been built for the 1878 Universal Exposition. It was a huge iron and glass structure which contained the industrial displays. It occupied the entire width of the exposition site, the land between the avenue de la Bourdonnais and the present avenue de Suffren, and covered 77,000 square meters, with 34,700 square meters of glass windows. At 111 meters, the Gallery covered the longest interior space in the world at the time, It cost 7,430,000 Francs, or seven times the cost of the Eiffel Tower. It was later used again at the 1900 Universal Exposition and then destroyed in 1910.

The Gallery of Machines used a system of hinged arches (like a series of bridge spans placed not end-to-end but parallel) made of steel or iron. Although often described as being constructed of steel, it was actually made of iron.
===Science and technology===
One important goal of the exposition was to present the latest in science and technology. Thomas Edison visited the exposition to visit a pavilion devoted to his recent inventions, including an improved phonograph with clearer sound quality.

Another new technology that was promoted at the exposition was the safety elevator, developed by a new American company, Otis Elevator. Otis built the elevators carrying passengers up the legs of the Eiffel Tower to the first level. When journalists expressed concern about the safety of the elevators, Otis technicians filled one elevator with three thousand kilograms of lead, simulating passengers, and then, with journalists from around the world watching, cut the cable with an axe. The elevator&#x27;s fall was halted ten feet above the ground by the Otis safety brakes.

There were pavilions especially devoted to the telephone and to electricity, and others devoted to maritime navigation, and another, the Palais de Guerre or Palace of War, to developments in military technology, such as naval artillery.

Prefabricated metal housing was another technology that appeared at the exposition. Gustave Eiffel developed a series of houses with roof and walls of galvanised steel, and wooden interiors, which could be rapidly put together or taken apart, largely for use in French colony of Indochina. Some of them served as ticket booths at the 1889 exposition; one of these old booths, now used as a shelter for hikers, can now be found in the Forest of Dampierre.

===The Palaces of Fine Arts and Liberal Arts===
Other major buildings included the Palaces of Liberal and Fine Arts, each with a richly decorated dome, facing each other across a garden and reflecting pool between the Eiffel Tower and the Palace of Machines. Both were designed by Jean-Camille Formigé with a similar plan. Both buildings had modern iron frames abundance of glass, but were completely covered with colorful ceramic tiles and sculpted decoration.

The exposition included a building by the Paris architect Pierre-Henri Picq. This was an elaborate iron and glass structure decorated with ceramic tiles in a Byzantine-Egyptian-Romanesque style. After the exposition the building was shipped to Fort de France and reassembled there, the work being completed by 1893. Known as the Schœlcher Library, initially it contained the 10,000 books that Victor Schœlcher had donated to the island. Today, it houses over 250,000 books and an ethnographic museum, and stands as a tribute to the man it is named after who led the movement to abolish slavery in Martinique.

===Fountains===
The exposition featured numerous fountains and reflecting pools, particularly in the mall that ran between the Eiffel Tower and the Palace of Machines. The largest fountain, near the Eiffel Tower, was entitled &quot;The City of Paris enlightens the world with its torch.&quot; The fountain was designed by Jean-Camille Formigé, who designed the nearby Palaces of Fine Arts and Liberal Arts. The other major fountain, not far away, was &quot;The Five Parts of the World&quot;, illustrating the continents. It was designed by Francis de Saint-Vidal.
=== The &quot;Street of Cairo&quot; and exotic habitations ===
The Rue de Caire (&quot;Street of Cairo&quot;) was a popular attraction designed to recreate the architecture and street life of Cairo. It provided a striking contrast to the very modern Palace of Machines, next to it. It was the idea of Baron Delort Gléon, an art collector and specialist in Egyptian art, with financial support from Charles De Lesseps, the head of the Egyptian committee for the exposition, and son of Ferdinand De Lesseps, the builder of the Suez Canal. It was a winding street, with buildings at odd angles, and featured, among other buildings, a minaret, two mosques, a school and two ornamental gateways. The doors, windows, and architectural fittings and decoration were real, imported from demolished buildings in Cairo. The street was populated by real Egyptians in costumes, including musicians, belly dancers, artists, craftsmen, and vendors of various Egyptian foods and delicacies.

The exposition featured several other examples of picturesque habitations and villages from around the world, including a Javanese village and recreated houses of villages from Senegal, Benin, and other colonies, with costumed residents.
=== The Pavilions of the participating nations and special industries ===
The Pavilions of the participating nations were located along the edge of the Champ de Mars. The Latin American nations had particularly colorful and lavish structures.

The Pavilion of Argentina was one of the largest and most decorative pavilions in the exposition. It was designed by the French architect Albert Ballu, who won the 1887 design competition. It covered 1,600 square meters, and was fifty meters high, topped by five iron and glass cupolas and surrounded by a frieze of mosaics, ceramics and coloured glass ornaments. After the exposition closed, it was taken apart and shipped to Buenos Aires, where it stood until it was dismantled in 1952.

In addition to the nations, there were pavilions of specialized industries, such as the Suez Canal company, the pavilion of the Transatlantic steamship company, the telephone and electricity pavilions, and the Pavilions of gas and oil. The Palace of Food Products was a very large and ornate structure, presenting French food and wine products. One of its highlights was an enormous sculpted wooden barrel from Champagne Mercier that could hold 200,000 bottles of champagne.

=== Charles Garnier&#x27;s &quot;History of Habitation&quot; ===
An unusual display was the &quot;History of Habitation&quot;, designed by Charles Garnier, the architect of the Paris opera house named for him. He was then 61 and had designed very few other major projects since the Opera. Although he had also signed a petition, along with other prominent writers and artists, that denounced the Eiffel Tower as an atrocity, he agreed to design a series of houses to illustrate the history of human habitation. The houses, separated by gardens, were placed close to the Eiffel Tower on a narrow strip of land along Quai D&#x27;Orsay and the banks of the Seine.

The houses were arranged by century and by continent, beginning with Garnier&#x27;s idea of prehistoric dwellings and huts, through the Ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans and other early civilizations, through the Middle Ages and Renaissance to the modern then houses from Japan, and China and the homes of Eskimos, and dwellings from Africa, Japan, China and Lapland, and dwellings of Native Americans, Aztecs and Incas. The dwellings were designed by Garnier with more imagination than strict historical accuracy, but they were picturesque and very popular. The Roman House had a special function, as the residence of the President of France when he visited the exposition.
=== Other buildings ===
Many smaller but picturesque buildings were included within or adjacent to the exposition. The architect Hector Guimard, then just twenty-two years old, built his first two buildings for the exposition; The cafe-restaurant Au Grand Neptune at 148 Quai Louis-Bleriot (Paris 16th arrondissement), and a small Pavillon of Electricity for an electrician named Ferdinand de Boyéres, located just outside the exposition site at avenue de Suffren. The Pavilion of electricity was demolished immediately after the exposition, and the cafe was torn down in 1910.

== Music and entertainment ==
The exposition itself included several large theatres for concerts and spectacles, including one for the dancers of Les Follies Parisiens. A separate theatre presented the music and dance of the French colonies in Indochina. Operas and concerts were also given in the grand hall of the Trocadero Palace.
* The Opéra Comique premiered on 14 May 1889 with a work specially composed for that event: Jules Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Esclarmonde&quot; (debuting American soprano Sybil Sanderson).
* The Barnum and Bailey Circus performed during the exposition in the Salle des Fetes of the Palais des Machines.
* At the exposition, the French composer Claude Debussy first heard Javanese gamelan music, performed by an ensemble from Java. This influenced some of his later compositions.

* Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov conducted concerts of Russian music by the Mighty Five, introducing them to Paris.

Outside the exposition, other theatres and venues presented a range of spectacles including Buffalo Bill Cody and his Wild West Show, with the sharpshooter Annie Oakley.

== Transportation – the miniature train ==
Transport around the exposition was partly provided by the 3 kilometre (1.9 mi) gauge Decauville railway at Exposition Universelle. The exposition railroad was reported to have carried 6,342,446 visitors in just six months of operation. Some of the locomotives used on this line later saw service on the Chemins de fer du Calvados and the Diégo Suarez Decauville railway.

== Notable visitors and special events ==

Celebrities and dignitaries from around the world visited the exposition. Thomas Edison, with his wife and daughter, visited the exposition on August 14, 1889, his third day in France, to visit the exhibit where his improved phonograph was being demonstrated. He also ascended to the viewing platform of the Eiffel Tower, where he was met by a group of Sioux Indians who were at the exposition to perform in Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show. He returned to the Eiffel Tower later in his visit (Sept 10), where he was hosted for a lunch in Eiffel&#x27;s private apartment on the Tower, along with the composer Charles Gounod.
* A &quot;Negro village&quot; (&quot;village nègre&quot;) where 400 people were displayed was a popular attraction.

Other prominent visitors included the Shah of Persia Nasereddin Shah, Prince of Wales (the future Edward VII) and his wife, Princess Alexandra; artists Antoni Gaudi, James McNeill Whistler, Edvard Munch, Rosa Bonheur and Paul Gauguin; U.S. journalist and diplomat Whitelaw Reid; author Henry James; Filipino patriots José Rizal and Marcelo H. del Pilar; and inventor Nikola Tesla.

A central attraction in the French section was the Imperial Diamond, at the time the largest diamond in the world.

The Mexican pavilion featured a model of an exotic (for Europeans) Aztec temple, a &quot;combination of archeology, history, architecture, and technology.&quot;

The presentation of Joseph Farcot&#x27;s steam engine, that had already won a prize in 1878.

==Statistics==
* Expenses: 41,500,000 Francs
* Receipts: 49,500,000 Francs
* Visitors: 32,250,297
* Exhibitors: over 61,722, of whom 55% were French
* Countries represented: 35

==Legacy==
Most of the buildings were on military land or city-owned park land, and they were demolished shortly after the exposition closed. The most notable survivor was the Eiffel Tower, which had been deliberately built on Paris city-owned land, to avoid demolition.

The Exhibition included a building by the Paris architect Pierre-Henri Picq. This was an elaborate iron and glass structure decorated with ceramic tiles in a Byzantine-Egyptian-Romanesque style. After the exposition, the building was shipped to Fort-de-France in Martinique and reassembled there, the work being completed by 1893. Known as the Schœlcher Library, initially it contained the 10,000 books that Victor Schœlcher had donated to the island. Today, it houses over 250,000 books and an ethnographic museum, and stands as a tribute to the man it is named after who led the movement to abolish slavery in Martinique.

<text>Bubble Tape is a type of Hubba Bubba bubble gum produced by Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company, and introduced in 1988. It experienced its greatest popularity in the early 1990s, due to its unique packaging and direct marketing to preteen children (&quot;it&#x27;s six feet of bubble gum - for you, not them&quot;—&quot;them&quot; referring to parents or just adults in general). At the peak of its popularity, over 1 million containers for Bubble Tape were being manufactured a week.

Bubble Tape comes in a small, round, plastic container similar in size to a hockey puck. This contains six feet (1.8 m) of gum wrapped in a spiral. The container functions much like a tape dispenser, although the top half can be removed or broken off.

==Flavors==
Most flavors are those available from the regular Hubba Bubba chewing gum line:
* Awesome Original
* Sour Green Apple
* Sour Watermelon
* Sour Blue Raspberry
* Cotton Candy
* Strapping Strawberry
* Juicy Fruit
* Gushing Grape
* Snappy Strawberry
* Triple Treat (also titled &#x27;Triple Mix&#x27;) – A mix of strawberry, blueberry, and watermelon

<text>Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine (; formerly known as Lachine—Notre-Dame-de-Grâce) was a federal electoral district in Quebec, Canada, that was represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1997 to 2015. Its population in 2006 was 104,715.

==Geography==

The neighbouring ridings were Mount Royal, Westmount—Ville-Marie, LaSalle—Émard, Châteauguay—Saint-Constant, Lac-Saint-Louis, Pierrefonds—Dollard, and Saint-Laurent—Cartierville.

===Political geography===
The Liberals had their strongest support in NDG, but also had a lot of support in most of Lachine and Dorval. The Conservatives failed to win any polls, but were the strongest in Lachine and Dorval. The Bloc, despite finishing third in 2008, was very strong in eastern Lachine including Ville Saint-Pierre. The riding was won by the NDP in its 2011 sweep of the province.

==History==

<doc id="671337" wikidata="Q1624372" url="?curid=671337" title="Holden Special Vehicles">
<text>Holden Special Vehicles (HSV) was the officially designated performance vehicle division for Holden. Established in 1987 and based in Clayton, Victoria, the privately owned company modified Holden models such as the standard wheelbase Commodore, long wheelbase Caprice and Statesman, and commercial Ute for domestic and export sale. HSV also modified other non-Holden cars within the General Motors lineup in low volumes.

Vehicles produced by Holden Special Vehicles have generally been marketed under the HSV brand name. However, in the early years, some retailed under the Holden brand in Australia whereas most cars for export (other than in New Zealand and Singapore) retailed under different names (namely, Vauxhall and Chevrolet Special Vehicles).

== History ==

Holden and Tom Walkinshaw Racing – an operation owned by Scottish racing-car driver and entrepreneur Tom Walkinshaw – established Holden Special Vehicles (HSV) as a joint venture in 1987. HSV effectively replaced the Holden Dealer Team (HDT) special-vehicles operation run by Peter Brock, after Holden severed its ties with HDT in February 1987 following the Energy Polarizer and &quot;HDT Director&quot; controversies.

Since 1987 HSV has built an array of modified vehicles, most of which have been based on Holden models powered by either Holden or GM sourced V8 engines.

The first car developed by HSV was the Holden VL Commodore SS Group A SV of 1988, which was badged and sold by Holden for Group A touring car racing homologation purposes. It went on to win the 1990 Bathurst 1000 race. The first car developed, badged and sold as an HSV was the SV88.

HSV began converting (re-manufacturing) the Chevrolet Camaro 2SS coupe and Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD pick-up truck from left-hand-drive to right-hand-drive to GM&#x27;s factory standards in mid-2018. The vehicles were sold with a factory warranty via the existing HSV-Holden dealership network. To cope with the expansion, HSV moved into a new premises, also in Clayton, in early 2018. It boosted job numbers from 130 to 150 staff in order to cope with production ramping up.

With GM discontinuing Holden in 2021, a newly formed GM subsidiary, General Motors Specialty Vehicles (GMSV), imports and distributes the Silverado in the Australasia region beginning in November 2020. GMSV handles the distribution of key Chevrolet vehicles. Walkinshaw Group, the parent company of HSV, continues to re-manufacture the Silverado 1500 on behalf of GMSV.

== Nameplates ==
The following is an alphabetical listing of the most notable and popular nameplates used by HSV.

; Avalanche
The HSV Avalanche is an all-wheel drive crossover SUV that was produced from 2003 to 2005.

* VZ (2005)

; ClubSport
The HSV ClubSport or Clubsport is a full size sports sedan that has represented the brand&#x27;s highest volume seller since its introduction in 1990. It was based on the mainstream Commodore range and has been the entry-level HSV model except between 1995 and 1998, when that role was filled by the Manta range. In 1999, HSV introduced a higher specification known as the &quot;R8&quot;. The Clubsport has been built over the following series:
* VN (1990–1991)

* VZ (2004–2006)

; Grange
The HSV Grange is a full size luxury sedan and it was based on the luxury Holden Statesman and Caprice twins.

; GTS
The HSV GTS is a full size high performance sedan that was based on the mainstream Commodore range. Excluding the special V6-engined editions sold in New Zealand in the VN and VP series, the proper and original V8-engined GTS was introduced in Australia in 1992 with the VP series. The GTS has represented the HSV brand&#x27;s most powerful offering to date. With the exception of the Z Series, when it was not part of the range, the GTS has been built over the following series:
* In 1990, HSV built special V6-engined GTS models for New Zealand in the VN and VP series.
* VP (1991–1993)

; Maloo
The HSV Maloo is a performance utility that has been produced since 1990 and was based on the Holden Ute. Its distinguishing features have been high-performance V8 engines and full body kits. The name &quot;Maloo&quot; means &quot;thunder&quot; in an Aboriginal language. It is said that former HSV managing director, John Crennan, coined the name for the vehicle after reading a book on Aboriginal Australians.

In 2001, HSV introduced a higher &quot;R8&quot; specification. In June 2006, a regular production Z Series Maloo R8 broke the record for the world&#x27;s fastest production performance pickup, at 271 km/h, (168 mph) beating the previous record holder, a Dodge Ram SRT-10 by 22 km/h.

The Maloo has been built over the following series:
* VG (1990–1991)
* VP (1991–1993)
* VR (1993–1995)
* VS (1995–2000)
* VU (2000–2002)
* VY (2002–2004)
* VZ (2004–2007)
* VE (2007–2013)
* VF (2013–2017)

The most powerful and developed version was the Gen-F 430 kW GTS Maloo, which was launched in November 2014. It featured GTS sedan mechanicals except for the &quot;Magnetic Ride Control&quot; suspension setup that, due to limited development opportunities, HSV left exclusively for the GTS sedan, Senator Signature and Grange. This Maloo was originally limited to 165 units, later increased to 250 plus 10 for export to New Zealand.

; Senator
The HSV Senator is a full size luxury sports sedan that was first introduced in 1992. It was based on the Holden Berlina and Calais twins. From 1997, HSV offered a wagon variant (based solely on the Berlina, since the Calais was never built in that body shape) and a higher specification model known as the &quot;Senator Signature&quot;. The Senator has been built over the following series:
* VP (1992–1993)
* VR (1993–1995)
* VS (1995–1997)
* VT (1997–2000)
* VX (2000–2002)
* VY (2002–2004)
* VZ (2004–2006)
* VE (2006–2013)
* VF (2013–2017)

; SV88
The HSV SV88 was the first car to bear the HSV badge and was designed to compete against HDT&#x27;s luxury performance Director model car. The SV88 was launched in 1988 and based on the VL Series luxury Calais.

; W427
The HSV W427 was a limited edition flagship based on the E Series, which was released to celebrate the company&#x27;s 20th anniversary in 2008. It was also a car produced to address the public disappointment caused by HSV canning its ambitious HRT 427 project previewed in 2002. It was powered by a LS7 V8 engine rated at at 6500 rpm and at 5000 rpm of torque.

== Holden-based models by series ==

=== VL ===
The Holden VL Commodore SS Group A SV was the first car produced by HSV. Developed under contract to Holden, it was released in March 1988. Modifications were made to the standard Holden 5.0 litre V8 to produce at 5200 rpm and at 4000 rpm. Best known for the polarising body kit and bluish-silver colour, the VL Group A SS was also the first model to feature a fuel-injected version of the Holden V8, with the first electronic fuel injection (EFI) VN Holden Commodore V8s not released until August 1988. The SV88 model was based on the VL Holden Calais and used a carburetored version of the V8 producing .

The range of vehicles for this series included (in chronological order):
* Commodore SS Group A SV, badged and sold as a Holden for racing homologation purposes
* SV88
* SV F20

=== VN/VG/VQ ===

A number of models based on the VN Holden Commodore were developed by HSV, the most potent of which was the Commodore SS Group A SV built for Holden&#x27;s touring car homologation requirements. It featured an extensively modified version of Holden&#x27;s 5.0 litre V8 to produce at 5200 rpm and at 4000 rpm coupled to a six-speed ZF S6-40 manual transmission as used in the Chevrolet Corvette ZR-1. Upgrades were also made to the suspension, tyres and brakes. Although a total production of 500 cars was original planned for racing homologation reasons, only 302 were ultimately produced in non-sequential order meaning that build number 450 may exist while build number 100 may not. The VN Group A SS was the last Holden built as a homologation racing special.

Other models used either or versions of the same V8 except the SV3800, which had a 3.8-litre V6. In 1990, the first HSV Maloo was released, based on the VG series Holden Ute of the time. The lighter Ute body provided a performance edge over the other HSV sedan counterparts. Models based on the long-wheelbase Holden VQ Caprice were released soon after. The SV90 and SV93 were treated with reworked suspension, wider front track and the V8. The Statesman 5000i (in both series I and II form) featured .

The VN series also spawned HSV V6-engined regional models, which are less known and widely based on Holden Commodore models with HSV add-ons.

The range of vehicles for this series included (in alphabetical order):
* Challenger (special V6 built for Canberra dealers)
* Clubsport
* DMG90 (special V6 build for Queensland dealers)
* GTS V6 (New Zealand export)
* LS (VN sedan and wagon - wagon only available in New Zealand)
* LS (VG V6 utility)
* Maloo (V8 utility)
* Statesman 5000i
* Statesman 5000i
* Statesman SV90
* Statesman SV93
* SV LE (sedan and wagon)
* SV89 (based on Berlina)
* SV3800
* SV5000
* SV T-30
* 8-Plus
and
* the Holden Commodore SS Group A SV, again badged and sold as a Holden for racing homologation purposes.

=== VP ===
With the release of the VP series, HSV began introducing independent rear suspension (IRS) to its models as well as introducing new model names, Senator and GTS. While the entry-level Clubsport and luxury Senator were equipped with the V8, the high-performance GTS came standard with the version and HSV&#x27;s premium brake package. A limited-slip differential was standard across the range.
* Clubsport
* Clubsport 5000i
* Sport Wagon.
* GTS
* Maloo
* Senator
* Senator 5000i
* SV91
* Nitron
* Formula
* HSV+6.
=== VR/VS ===

Following the appointment of award-winning designer Ian Callum as design chief for TWR, VR series HSV models benefited from a more cohesive and stylish body design. Upgrades were made to the 5.0 litre V8 to yield , while the GTS included a 5.7-litre stroked version producing 292 PS (215 kW) (also available as an option on the Senator) from May 1994 onwards. The VS series of 1995 introduced mild styling tweaks and a new three-spoke alloy wheel design. A value-oriented Manta was established as the base HSV model to broaden appeal. In 1996, a limited edition flagship GTS-R was created which came standard with the 5.7-litre V8, Tremec T56 six-speed transmission and &quot;Hydratrak&quot; limited slip differential (LSD) package. Available only in a polarising bright yellow colour (known as &quot;XU-3 Yellah&quot;) with carbon fibre inserts and large rear wing, the GTS-R engine could be blueprinted for more power. In total, 85 GTS-Rs were produced (10 exported to New Zealand). The VS series II of 1996 introduced HSV&#x27;s &quot;Integrated Security System&quot; (ISS) as standard, which featured an immobiliser and different electronics configuration for each car produced in an effort to deter theft. In 1996, a new Statesman-based model known as the Grange replaced previous HSV Statesman models.

* Clubsport (wagon available only in the VR Series)
* GTS
* Maloo
* Manta (VS only)
* Senator
* Statesman
* Grange (from the VS Series III of 1996).

=== VT ===

This series was based on the all-new Holden VT Commodore range released in August 1997. It was the last series to be powered by Australian-made 5.0 litre V8 (cast iron block) and the 5.7-litre stroker in the GTS. A Senator Signature wagon was introduced and was mechanically identical to the sedan counterpart. The VS ute bodyshell was retained for the Maloo. There were only 180 Manta units produced, after which this model was dropped from production due to its close competition with the donor Commodore SS model.

HSV&#x27;s VT range included:
* Manta (entry-level)
* Clubsport
* GTS (top performance model)
* Senator Signature (entry luxury model based on Calais)
* Senator Signature wagon
* Grange (top luxury model based on Caprice)
* Maloo (VS series based utility)
* SV99 (limited to only 99 vehicles, all produced between 1999 and 2000)

The range also comprised the XU8, which was built in limited numbers to carry last-ever Australian-made V8 engine.

The VT Series II represented a major update for HSV through the introduction of the new 5.7 litre GENIII LS1 V8, which saw &quot;Wheels&quot; magazine name the GTS as the fastest Holden ever at the time. The Manta and Senator Signature wagon were both dropped from the line-up due to poor sale performance. The flagship GTS presented many unique features such as a Callaway tuned version of the LS1, a 3.91 final drive ratio and the addition of toe-control links to its IRS design. The recent release of the new WH series Caprice in 2001 allowed the Grange to gain its new look. This series also saw the introduction of a supercharged V6 model named the XU6, which ultimately did not prove successful and was described as being agricultural against new competitors such as the Magna VR-X, which was rated a superior product in a direct comparison. For the first time, a more performance-oriented Clubsport was launched, known as the Clubsport R8. It came standard with HSV&#x27;s &quot;Performance&quot; suspension and braking package, which were offered as optional extras on the Clubsport. Again, the Maloo remained available using the VS ute body shell.

HSV&#x27;s VT Series II range included:
* XU6 (V6 supercharged entry-level)
* Clubsport
* Clubsport R8 (new performance model)
* GTS
* Senator Signature
* Grange
* Maloo.

=== VX/VU ===

Acting on feedback from owners, HSV strove to differentiate its range of vehicles from the standard Holden offerings. To achieve this, HSV introduced more distinguishing bodykit and interior designs. This series also saw the LS1 engine output increase by . The introduction of the new VU Holden Ute allowed HSV to produce an all-new Maloo variant. A limited edition Senator 300 model also became available, equipped with the V8 and suspension modifications from the GTS.

The range included:
* XU6
* Clubsport
* Clubsport R8
* Senator Signature
* Senator 300 (top performance luxury model)
* Grange
* GTS
* Maloo (new utility bodyshell).
The VX range saw HSV offer its first Coupé models based on the new V2 series, in GTO and GTS spec. The latter replaced the GTS sedan but was powered by a less powerful engine. A Maloo R8 model was added with similar upgraded specification to the Clubsport R8. This series saw the addition of the XU6-Maloo, which was essentially a utility version of the XU6 sedan. This model was shortly discontinued due to a lack of demand. The special edition SV300 was introduced to replace the Senator 300. Toe-control links for the rear suspension was now fitted across the range in line with the Holden VX series update, for improved handling. The VXII update also brought with it the addition of Microdots across the range in order to reduce theft, a feature HSV refers to as &quot;HSV DNA&quot;.

The range now included:
* XU6
* Clubsport
* Clubsport R8
* Senator Signature
* SV300
* Grange
* Coupé GTO
* Coupé GTS
* Maloo
* Maloo R8
* XU6-Maloo (entry level utility)

=== Y Series ===

Coinciding with the release of the VY Commodore, HSV produced the Y Series models adopting an even more distinguishing design and an alphabetical designation to further distance itself from donor Holden. While the GTS sedan returned (with a recalibrated ECU increasing power to ), the XU6 was discontinued due to a lack of demand attributed to a perceived lack of extra power relative to Holden&#x27;s supercharged V6 sedans. The twin kidney grille design first introduced on the VR series Commodore became HSV&#x27;s new signature grille. Finally, the Senator range was split into entry-level Senator and high-end luxury Senator Signature models.

The range included:
* Clubsport
* Clubsport R8
* GTS
* Senator
* Senator Signature
* Grange
* Coupé GTO
* Coupé GTS
* Maloo
* Maloo R8
* Avalanche (AWD performance wagon)

;Y II Series
This upgraded range is characterised by a significant power increase to . Rumors followed that a new engine was due for release, with the development of GM&#x27;s new LS2 nearly complete. This power upgrade closed the performance gap between HSV&#x27;s mainstream models and the flagship GTS, which prompted speculation that the GTS was set for a power increase as well. An updated WK Statesman/Caprice from Holden also formed the basis for the new Grange. The GTO Coupé returned, and the forays of parent company Holden into AWD saw the introduction of the Avalanche (based on the Holden Adventra), the XUV (based on the Holden Crewman), and the Coupé4 (based on the Holden Monaro). The latter was particularly significant, as it was the first time that Holden&#x27;s AWD system had been used in such a low-riding application. These new additions to the range made the Y Series II the biggest HSV range in history, with 16 variants.

The range included:
* Clubsport
* Clubsport R8
* Clubsport SE
* GTS
* Senator
* Senator Signature
* Grange
* Coupé GTO
* Coupé GTS
* Coupé4 (AWD)
* Maloo
* Maloo R8
* Avalanche
* Avalanche XUV (AWD performance utility)

=== Z Series ===

This series of HSVs (released in October 2004) were known as the &quot;Z&quot; Series, reflecting the fact they were based on the VZ-series of the donor Holden Commodore. This saw the introduction, across the range, of the new GM LS2 V8, which generated 297 kW (400 hp). The AWD models retained the less powerful LS1. The lack of a GTS model in this series was attributable to the negligible power difference between the new LS2 models and a potential GTS, sparking rumors that the new LS7 V8 was going to be used in the next series. In lieu of the GTS, HSV released the SV6000, which was based on the Clubsport and limited to 50 units. A new WL Statesman/Caprice model also resulted in an upgraded Grange.

The Z-series was the first range with which HSV reached the Middle East with the one-make racing ClubSport R sedans, and it was the last series to be based on the 1997–2006 VT Commodore, which adopted the V-body.

On 25 May 2006, a standard 2006 HSV Maloo R8 driven by Mark Skaife was clocked at an averaged speed of 271.44 km/h (168.7 mph) in the Woomera, South Australia. The speed was recognised by the Guinness World Records representative, Chris Sheedy, as the Fastest Production Pickup Truck recorded. The speed improved over the previous record held by a Dodge Ram SRT-10 at 248.784 km/h (154.587 mph).

A revised range was launched in January 2006, and is designated as the Z Series MY06 (in lieu of the more traditional &quot;Series II&quot; moniker).

The limited edition Signature Coupe was HSV&#x27;s farewell to the Monaro/GTO as the last two door coupe manufactured in Australia.

The range included:
* Clubsport
* Clubsport R (one-make racing series)
* Clubsport R8
* Clubsport R8 Holden Racing Team (limited edition)
* Clubsport R8 Toll HSV Dealer Team (limited edition)
* SV6000 (limited edition)
* Grange
* Senator
* Senator Skaife Signature (limited edition)
* Coupé GTO
* Coupé4 AWD
* Coupé GTO LE
* Coupé Signature (limited edition)
* Maloo
* Maloo R8
* Maloo R8 15th Anniversary (limited edition)
* Avalanche
* Avalanche XUV
*Crewman ss thunder (gen4 6.0litre)

In addition, in July 2005, HSV released upgraded manual-only Clubsport, Clubsport R8 and Coupé GTO fitted with optional 2-Stage &quot;Dealer Team Spec&quot; performance packages.

=== E Series ===

An all-new Holden Commodore chassis, known as the VE was unveiled in July 2006. Following this, a new range of &quot;E&quot; Series HSV models were released in August 2006.

Changes to the exhaust system yielded a increase in power (see below) for the LS2 to . Extensive modifications to the base VE Commodore sheetmetal and interior were introduced, most notably the unique LED taillights and distinctive side vents. The new GM 6L80-E 6 speed automatic transmission from the VE Commodore is offered, and Electronic Stability Control is standard on all models.

The GTS, Senator Signature and Grange additionally feature switchable &quot;Magnetic Ride Control&quot; to improve ride and handling. As such, the E Series represents HSV&#x27;s most expensive model developments in its history, with the MRC suspension system alone costing A$4.5 million. In October, a new Grange model based on the Holden WM Caprice was released featuring the same V8 and MRC suspension as the Senator Signature and GTS, albeit with its own unique settings.

HSV also released a HSV Senator Signature SV08 which is released in a limited run of 20 manual and 30 automatic units. This model featured lower paint-outs, sill plates and extra chrome accents on the side mirrors and door handles. It was powered by a V8 engine developing 317 kW mated to a new Tremec TR-6060 gearbox and had 20-inch &quot;Pentagon&quot; wheels, &quot;Magnetic Ride Control&quot; suspension system with Sport mode and Park Assist system.

In August 2008, HSV launched its new flagship model, the W427. This car is based on the GTS, but carries a 7.0 L LS7 V8 engine along with larger brakes, strengthened gearbox, revised suspension and unique MRC settings. The W427 was the most powerful car ever made in Australia until the release of the Gen-F GTS, with power outputs of at 7000 rpm and at 5000 rpm. It is still the most expensive, at $155 500.

On 28 March 2008, HSV announced that the LS3 6.2-litre engine would be fitted to all E-Series models (with the exception of the LS7 W427) from April 2008. The LS3 power output is , whilst peak torque has not increased over the LS2. 12 May 2008 saw the announcement of a new HSV E Series model; the HSV &quot;Tourer&quot;. This new model, based on the VE Holden Sportwagon was later officially released in September 2008.

The range included:
* Clubsport R8
* Clubsport R8 20th Anniversary Edition (limited edition)
* Clubsport R8 Tourer
* Clubsport GXP (limited edition)
* GTS
* W427
* Senator Signature
* Senator SV08 (limited edition)
* Grange
* Maloo R8
* Maloo GXP (limited edition)

;E Series 2
The HSV E Series 2 range was released late 2009 and was the most major update since the release of E Series HSV&#x27;s. Prices started at $65,990 for the Clubsport R8.
The range received many cosmetic changes with new front and rear bumpers, twin-nostriled bonnet (from the Pontiac G8) and a new range of wheel designs. The Series 2 has a very distinctive look set of daytime running lights standard across the E2 range. On 9 September 2010, HSV released the E Series 3.

The new engines in the range are the 6.2-litre LS3 V8 used exclusively by the HSV GTS, with the rest of the E2 range being powered by an LS3 in trim. The new engines have also improved fuel economy by 4.2 per cent on the LS3 V8.
New is the intelligent launch controls, Competition mode ESC and Extended cruise control systems which are all standard for E2 models excluding intelligent launch control which is only available with a manual transmission.
;E Series 3

This last version of the E Series was released on 21 September 2010.
The noticeable changes between E Series 2 and 3 included an increase in power in the GTS range to , making it once again the top of the HSV list; the GTS E Series II was also increased to a price of $80,990; the HSV Enhanced Driver Interface (racing version of Holden IQ), the new LPI system, LPG and unleaded fuel are $5,990 options on all models except the R8 Tourer; and the updated Holden VE II Commodore interior and new rear exhaust and rear spoilers.

=== Gen-F ===

The Gen-F series, which is based on the VF Commodore series went on sale in August 2013. The HSV GTS became the most powerful production car ever produced in Australia, with and of torque. Its retail price was considerably higher than the equivalent E Series 3 models, costing over $90,000.

== Other models ==
Although most HSV models are based on variants of the Holden Commodore, HSV also developed a select few using other vehicles from the Holden lineup.

=== Astra SV1800 ===
The HSV Astra SV1800 was released in 1988, and was based on the LD-series Holden Astra of the time (which was itself based on the Nissan Pulsar N13 series).

It shared the same 1.8L engine as the standard Astra, but was released with extractors, sports exhaust and an aerodynamic sports body kit (adopted from the Walkinshaw, which is why the SV1800 was nicknamed the Baby Walky) however, only 65 were made in both sedan and hatchback form.

=== Astra Aero ===
The 1988 HSV Astra Aero was a limited-edition model developed by Holden Special Vehicles (HSV) as counterpart to the Astra SV1800. Based on the LD-series series Holden Astra, the Aero featured primarily cosmetic and suspension enhancements. Approximately 150 units were produced, and are identifiable by the &quot;Aero&quot; badging on the rear instead of SV1800.

=== VXR Turbo ===

The HSV VXR Turbo is a rebadged Vauxhall Astra which was imported from Belgium between 2006 and 2009. It has a 2.0 litre turbocharged 4-cylinder engine producing and , coupled to a 6-speed manual transmission. Additionally it is equipped with the adaptive IDS (Interactive Driving System) suspension system along with ESC, traction control system, ABS and BA. The VXR Turbo was marketed without the Astra name.

=== VXR Nürburgring Edition ===

The VXR Nürburgring Edition is a rebadged special variant of the Vauxhall Astra VXR, produced in a limited run of 835 units worldwide. This specific number was chosen to commemorate the car&#x27;s Nürburgring Nordschleife lap time of 8 minutes and 35 seconds, achieved in 2005.

In Australia, HSV imported a very limited number of these vehicles. Specifically, only 20 units were brought into the country. These were only available in Australia in Glacier White. 

The Nürburgring Edition featured a Remus exhaust system, which not only provided a more aggressive sound but also contributed to an increase in power output. While exact figures vary, some sources suggest an additional - over the standard VXR.
The car is equipped with lightweight forged alloy wheels, reducing unsprung weight by approximately 3 kg per corner. These wheels were paired with high-performance tires, enhancing grip and handling characteristics. It also featured distinctive visual elements included a chequered flag body graphic, carbon fiber-effect door mirrors, and unique badging to signify its association with the Nürburgring located on the door pillars. 

=== HSV Jackaroo ===
The mid-size SUV known as the HSV Jackaroo was introduced in 1993 as a limited-production model by Holden Special Vehicles (HSV). Based on the Holden Jackaroo S (8DQ35), itself derived from the second-generation Isuzu Trooper, the HSV Jackaroo was a cosmetic and branding enhancement rather than a performance modification.

The vehicle was available in both two-door and four-door configurations, featuring a unique HSV body kit, upgraded alloy wheels, and HSV-specific badging. A total of 85 units were produced, with 79 sold to the public and the remainder retained by dealers or as prototypes.

The HSV Jackaroo retained the standard 3.2L SOHC V6 petrol engine producing 130 kW (177 hp), with a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. It was also offered with an optional 3.1L turbocharged diesel engine with an intercooler. Unlike the HDT Jackaroo, no performance enhancements were made to the drivetrain. HSV opted against performance modifications due to the vehicle&#x27;s proven success in off-road racing, particularly in events such as the Dakar Rally and the Australian Safari, where its durability and capability were already well-established. 

Only the petrol version of this car is known to exist, with 39 manual and 40 automatic versions released to the public.

=== HSV Jackaroo SE ===
Holden restructured the Jackaroo lineup at the end of 1993, leading to the release of the HSV Jackaroo SE (8DS35) in 1994, which remained in production until 1995. This model was the complete opposite of the original HSV Jackaroo—fully equipped and positioned as the top trim level. It bridged the gap between the mid-spec XS wagons and the high-end Monterey trim. Unlike its predecessor, the SE model was marketed without HSV badging but retained several signature styling upgrades characteristic of HSV vehicles.

The SE variant maintained the same 3.2L V6 engine producing 130 kW (177 hp) and included improvements in electronic communication between the engine management system and the automatic transmission, leading to smoother gear transitions. A total of 234 HSV Jackaroo SE units were produced.

Key distinguishing features of the SE model included the original HSV Wheel-arch flares, SV5000 style Alloy wheels, four different options of the Two-tone paint scheme, instead of the original Radiant Red and Updated interior trim. The Vehicle lost its external HSV corporate branding

While retaining its original off-road capability, the SE model was targeted at buyers seeking a more refined and stylish SUV without altering its mechanical performance.

===SportsCat===
The HSV SportsCat is a high-performance sports utility vehicle (SUV) produced from 2018 to 2020. Based on the Holden Colorado, the SportsCat features enhanced suspension, styling, and braking upgrades over the standard model.

Introduced as HSV&#x27;s first sports-oriented 4x4, the SportsCat was designed to compete in the performance ute segment. It retained the 2.8L Duramax turbo-diesel engine from the Colorado but received chassis and handling refinements.
The SportsCat was available in two trim levels:

SportsCat V – Base model featuring HSV styling, sports suspension, and interior upgrades.

SportsCat SV – Higher-spec variant with additional performance features, including a rear de-coupling anti-roll bar and an AP Racing brake package.

The HSV SportsCat features HSV Sports Suspension, with an optional SupaShock system for enhanced road and off-road capability. Braking performance is upgraded on the SV model, which includes AP Racing 4-piston front brakes. It rides on 18-inch forged alloy wheels fitted with Cooper Zeon LTZ all-terrain tyres. Inside, the cabin is equipped with HSV Performance seats, upholstered in Windsor Suede with red stitching. The MyLink infotainment system supports Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and Satellite Navigation, while safety features include Lane Departure Warning and Forward Collision Alert.

The SportsCat ceased production in 2020, following the closure of HSV operations and the discontinuation of the Holden brand in Australia.

=== Colorado V8 ===

Plans for a high power version of the Holden Colorado using the LT1 engine and a 10-speed transmission was cancelled in 2020 with the closure of HSV and Holden. Two prototypes were built with powertrains taken from crash-tested Chevrolet Camaros, one based on a HSV SportsCat, and the other based on a North American Chevrolet Colorado to be aimed at that market. It was the final project worked on by HSV, and would have received a new name, ThunderCat being one of the considered options.

The only road-registerable prototype, painted in Panorama Silver, was later auctioned as a collector’s item.

== Production milestones ==
In 2014, HSV reported the following production milestones:
* June 1991: 5,000th HSV built was a SV T-30
* April 1997: 20,000th HSV built was a Senator
* August 2003: 40,000th HSV built was a ClubSport
* July 2006: 50,000th HSV built was a ClubSport
* February 2013: 75,000th HSV built was a ClubSport
* September 2014: 80,000th HSV built was a ClubSport R8 in &quot;Phantom Black&quot; paint.

== Exports ==
HSV exported its range to New Zealand without any rebranding, as in the case of Singapore, where exports resumed in 2010 after a two-decade absence. From the 2000s, however, exports to the United Kingdom and Middle East, saw the cars rebadged Vauxhall and CSV, respectively.

=== Vauxhall ===
* The Coupé GTO, in Y Series II and Z Series, was exported to the UK badged as the Vauxhall Monaro VXR. They were powered by a ) LS1 V8 engine and a LS2 V8 engines, respectively.
* Between 2007 and 2013, the E Series of the Clubsport R8 was also exported to the UK badged as the Vauxhall VXR8. This car was powered by the standard 6-Litre LS2 V8 engine with and , but was also available as a supercharged model using the same kit that had been available in Australia as an option via Walkinshaw Performance. These models were followed by a VXR8 GTS, which was based on the HSV E2 GTS in Australia. This model was updated with a new front end and a 6.2-litre LS3 V8 engine with and , which was sold until 2013, when the updated Gen-F was introduced with a 6.2-litre supercharged LSA V8 with and . This was sold until 2017, when Holden stopped manufacturing in Australia.

=== Chevrolet Special Vehicles (CSV) ===

* HSV first reached into the Middle Eastern market with a one-race series featuring stripped down ClubSport R (Z Series) sedans in Dubai and Bahrain.
* The Clubsport R8 (E Series) followed as a road legal car, rebadged as the Chevrolet Special Vehicles CR8

== Concept cars ==
;HRT Maloo utility
Based on the VX HSV Maloo, it was fitted with a new bodykit featuring significantly flared wheel arches to accommodate wider track and 20-inch wheels. The roof was lowered and modifications made to the suspension to produce a &quot;ground hugging&quot; stance. The ute was powered by a LS6 V8 stroked to 6.2 litres (producing 350 kW (469 hp)) with exhaust exiting from the side.

;HRT 427

Unveiled at the 2002 Sydney Motor Show, the HRT (Holden Racing Team) 427 was based on a modified Holden Monaro bodyshell and, among other things, it featured a (7.0-Litre) V8 engine (adapted from the Corvette C5-R) – hence the name. Due to the high cost specifications, the business case for full production failed since Holden could not build the 427 in such limited quantities for the original asking price of A$215,000. In all, only two road and four racing versions were ever built.

;GTS-R

This concept was unveiled at the 2004 Sydney Motor Show also based on the Monaro bodyshell. Similarities could be drawn with the HRT 427, however, this model was only intended for a one-make racing series and was powered by a modified 6.0-litre version of Chevrolet&#x27;s LS2 V8 engine producing . This concept, too, never reached production.

== Engines ==

=== GM 6.2-litre Supercharged V8 LSA ===
* Power: at 6000 rpm.
* Torque: at 4200 rpm.
The supercharged 6.2L LSA is similar to the LS9 and debuted in the 2009 CTS-V. The LSA has been SAE certified at 556 bhp (415 kW) at 6100 rpm and 551 lb·ft (747 N·m) at 3800 rpm. GM labels it &quot;the most powerful ever offered in Cadillac&#x27;s nearly 106-year history&quot;. The LSA features a smaller 1.9L capacity supercharger rather than the 2.3 L variant of the LS9. Other differences include a slightly lower 9.0:1 compression ratio, single unit heat exchanger and cast pistons.
A 580 bhp (430 kW) and 556 lb·ft (754 N·m) version of the LSA engine is used in the 2012 Camaro ZL1. On 26 April 2013, HSV announced that this version of the LSA engine will also be used in the GEN-F GTS.

=== GM 7.0-litre V8 LS7 ===
* Power: (W427)
* Torque: (W427)
This engine was originally used in the sixth-generation Corvette Z06 that was then shipped over for usage in the W427. It made its first appearance in Australia in 2008. The W427 was designed and built to celebrate the 20th anniversary of HSV.

=== GM 6.2-litre V8 LS3 ===
* Power: (E Series), (E Series II GTS), 340 kW (462 PS, 456 hp) (GEN-F SV Enhanced models)
* Torque: (E Series), (GEN-F SV Enhanced models)
This engine debuted in the E Series. It is a GM built LS3 V8 customized for HSV&#x27;s usage. The transition from LS2 to LS3 was primarily to meet impending Euro IV emissions requirements being introduced in Australia on 1 January 2009 and to compete against 2008&#x27;s FPV GT.

=== GM 6.0-litre V8 LS2 ===
* Power: at 6000 rpm (Z series), (E Series)
* Torque: at 4400 rpm (Z series), (E Series)
This engine debuted in the Z series. It is a GM built LS2 V8 customized for HSV&#x27;s usage.
One of the main reasons that this engine was used is that the LS1 V8 does not meet ADR 79/01 (Euro III) emissions regulations. This new engine also has connections to the L76 6.0-litre used in the VZ and VE Holden Commodores.

=== GM 5.7-litre V8 LS1 ===
* Power: (VTII), (VX), (Y series), (AWD models), (YII series)
* Torque: (VTII), (VX), (Y series), (YII series)
This motor started its debut in the VTII series of HSV sedans. It produced of power – more than HSV&#x27;s previous &quot;Stroker&quot; 5.7 V8 used in the VT. It was a slightly de-tuned version, with less than when it was in the two-door sports body of the Corvette. Continuous modifications were made to the LS1 engine throughout its lifetime, reaching in the YII series, just under the GTS. AWD models such as the Coupé4 retained a similar configuration to other YII series models but were fitted with a more restrictive exhaust system, reducing power to . The LS1 was phased out for the new 6.0-litre LS2 in the Z Series. However, it was still used in the AWD models of the Z series.

=== GM 5.7-litre V8 LS1 (C4B) ===
* Power: at 6000 rpm
* Torque: at 4800 rpm A modified version of the LS1 enhanced by Callaway Cars Incorporated, this engine was used on the VTII, VX and Y series of GTS models as well as the SV300. Differences from the LS1 included ported cylinder heads, larger throttle body, revised camshaft, remapped ECU, titanium valve spring retainers, upgraded valve springs and valves. The compression ratio was also lowered slightly to 9.95:1 and the engine ran MAFless. In HSV models, this engine was used with a higher than standard 3.91:1 final drive ratio.

=== HSV 5.7-litre &#x27;350ci Harrop Stroker&#x27; V8 ===
* Power: at 4800 rpm (VR-VS), (VT)
* Torque: at 3600 rpm This motor had its debut in the VR series of HSV sedans. It was a bored and stroked version of the Holden 304ci 5.0 litre and was originally available on the VR Senator and GTS 215i. A Tremec T-56 six-speed manual gearbox option exclusive to this engine was introduced as the then current Borg-Warner T-5 5-speed could not reliably handle the prodigious amounts of torque it produced. The HSV VS GTS-R had the blueprint option to produce more power at around . The 215i engine was also available on the Grange long-wheelbase model. Its last appearance was in the VT GTS(Series 1). The LS1 replaced it in the VTII series.

=== Holden 5.0-litre V8 ===
* Power: at 5200 rpm (VL), (VN SS) (VN Group A SS), (VP), at 4800 rpm (VN-VP), (VR-VS), (VT)
* Torque: at 4000 rpm(VL), (VN Group A SS), at 3600 rpm (VN-VP), at 3600 rpm (VN-VS), at 3600 rpm (VT)
This engine for HSV was available in 2 guises. The twin throttle bodied versions designed for racing use were available in the VL and VN Group A cars from 1988 and 1990 respectively. For the majority of HSV sedans using this capacity motor, the engines were modified versions of the standard EFI Holden V8. Note that there was also a VP equipped Clubsport 5000i that used the remaining 4 bolt main Group A blocks with SV5000 red motor ancillaries.
The LS1 replaced it in the VTII series.
* Additionally:
1. A non-EFI version was fitted to the VL Calais SV88, producing at 4400 rpm and at 3200 rpm.
2. The VL SS Group A SV Commodore was the first Holden V8 to feature Electronic Fuel Injection.

=== HSV 3.8-litre supercharged V6 ===
* Power: at 5000 rpm
* Torque: at 3200 rpm
Available on the VT and VX series HSV XU6. Also only two HSV VX Senators were ever produced with a V6 Supercharged motor. There were several limited VT HSV sedans and wagons with the L67. This engine is a modified version of Holden&#x27;s supercharged V6 with upgraded air intake and exhaust to boost power from the standard . Due to the popularity and superior performance of Ford&#x27;s standard I6 engine, let alone the turbocharged variant, this model was removed from the line-up after the VY series.

=== ISUZU 3.2-litre SOHC 6VD1 V6 ===
* Power: at 4888 rpm
* Torque: at 3000 rpm
Available on the HSV Jackaroo and HSV Jackaroo SE, the 3.2L SOHC V6 engine produced and of torque. These models retained the standard engine configuration from the Holden Jackaroo, without performance modifications.

=== VXR 2.0-litre Ecotec-4 Turbo ===
* Power: at 5600 rpm
* Torque: at 2400 rpm
This 4-cylinder engine is used in the HSV VXR, a model based on the Vauxhall Astra VXR/Opel Astra OPC.

== V8 Supercars ==
In 2005, HSV provided sponsorship for the V8 Supercar team formerly known as the Kmart Racing Team. The team adopted HSV Dealer Team as their new name. With Rick Kelly and Garth Tander driving the two cars, the newly renamed team struggled in its first few outings in 2005, they found form later in the season, and from round one led the 2006 Championship to victory. Rick Kelly won the 2006 series.. In 2007, Tander and Kelly won 17 races between them out of a possible 37, with Tander winning 15 of them and four round wins, winning the championship along the way. HSVDT also won their second Teams Championship in succession. The team was disbanded for the 2009 season. HSV&#x27;s remaining sponsorship is with Walkinshaw Andretti United.

== Rivals ==
HSV&#x27;s direct rival was Ford Australia through its various performance arms, namely Ford Tickford Experience (FTE) from 1999, and Ford Performance Vehicles (FPV) from 2002 to 2014, with their production of modified Ford Falcon-based cars. Another rival, albeit on a smaller scale, has been Corsa Specialised Vehicles (CSV – not to be confused with HSV&#x27;s exports badged Chevrolet Special Vehicles in some markets) with its Commodore-based high performance cars that included the CSV GTS of 2007. This CSV beat the HSV W427 to the market by being the first Holden vehicle powered by a 7.0L LS7 V8 engine.

<text>&quot;Takin&#x27; Care of Business&quot; is a song written by Randy Bachman and first recorded by Canadian rock group Bachman–Turner Overdrive (BTO) for their 1973 album &quot;Bachman–Turner Overdrive II&quot;. The lead vocal is sung by song author.

== Development ==
Randy Bachman had developed what would later become &quot;Takin&#x27; Care of Business&quot; while still a member of the Guess Who. His original idea was to write about a recording technician who worked on the Guess Who&#x27;s recordings. This particular technician would take the 8:15 train to get to work, inspiring the lyrics &quot;take the 8:15 into the city&quot;.

In the early arrangement for the song, which had the working title &quot;White Collar Worker&quot;, the chorus riff and vocal melody were similar to that of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; (which in turn was inspired by a Chuck Berry song Johnny B. Goode). When Bachman first played this version for Burton Cummings, Cummings declared that he was ashamed of him and that The Guess Who would never record the song because the Beatles would sue them.

Bachman still felt like the main riff and verses were good, it was only when the song got to the chorus that everyone hated it. While BTO was still playing smaller venues in support of its first album, Bachman was driving into Vancouver for a gig and listening to the radio when he heard local DJ Daryl B&#x27;s catch phrase &quot;We&#x27;re takin&#x27; care of business&quot;. Lead vocalist Fred Turner&#x27;s voice gave out before the band&#x27;s last set that night. Bachman sang some cover songs to get through the last set, and on a whim, he told the band to play the C, B-flat and F chords (a I-VII-IV progression) over and over, and he sang &quot;White Collar Worker&quot; with the new words &quot;Takin&#x27; Care of Business&quot; inserted into the chorus. Recalled Randy: &quot;When we finished the song that night, people kept clapping, stomping, and shouting &#x27;takin&#x27; care of business&#x27; over and over. So we picked up the tempo again and reprised the song for another ten minutes. Afterwards, we all knew we had something.&quot;

After this, he rewrote the lyrics to &quot;White Collar Worker&quot; with a new chorus and the title &quot;Takin&#x27; Care of Business&quot;. The new lyrics also take a self-ironic glance at the idea of glamorous rock stars who do not really need to work, contrasted with working-class men, in a vein that prefigured Dire Straits&#x27; &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; a decade later. Along with this he wrote a revised guitar riff, which was the I-VII-IV progression played with a shuffle. Bachman says he then handed over the lyrics to Fred Turner with the thought that Turner would sing the lead vocal. But Turner handed them back, saying Randy should sing the lead as it would give himself a needed vocal break when the band performed live.

The original studio version, recorded at Kaye-Smith Studios in Seattle, Washington, features prominent piano, played by Norman Durkee. The reason for Durkee&#x27;s presence at the studio, and on the track, has been the subject of conflicting information. Randy Bachman has repeatedly stated in interviews that Durkee was delivering pizzas at the time to musicians in the studio, overheard the song being rehearsed, and convinced the band that the song needed a piano part, and that Durkee, who was then an aspiring musician, should be the one to play it. However, both Robbie Bachman and Durkee himself have stated that Durkee was actually at the studio as a musician, recording commercials in the next room, when sound engineer Buzz Richmond asked him to play on &quot;Takin&#x27; Care of Business&quot;. According to this version of events, Durkee had only a few minutes to spare, and, quickly conferring with Randy Bachman, he scribbled down the chords (on a pizza box), and, without listening to the song beforehand, recorded the piano part in one take.

On May 7, 1994, Randy and a plugged-in stage band led 1300 guitarists to a Guinness World Record. Most guitarists ever gathered that played a song for over an hour by playing &quot;Taking Care of Business&quot; at Robson Square in Vancouver, a record that stands today.
In 1980, Kurtis Blow did a cover of &quot;Takin&#x27; Care of Business&quot; on his self-titled debut album, with Mercury Records.

== Reception ==
The song was recorded by Bachman–Turner Overdrive in late 1973 for their second album &quot;Bachman–Turner Overdrive II&quot;. It reached number 12 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 (August 10, 1974), number 6 on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; Top 100, and number 3 on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; charts, and would become one of BTO&#x27;s most enduring and well-known songs. &quot;Takin&#x27; Care of Business&quot; spent 20 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, longer than any other BTO single. &quot;Cash Box&quot; called it &quot;hard rock with a strong blues base,&quot; stating that &quot;Randy Bachman&#x27;s lead vocals are perfect and the group&#x27;s music is unbeatable.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; said that &quot;Old &#x27;TCB&#x27; expression now comes to mean &#x27;total colossal boogie.&#x27;&quot;

In 2011, Bachman said it was the most licensed song in Sony Music&#x27;s publishing catalogue. It is often referred to as &quot;the provincial rock anthem of Manitoba&quot;. Bachman himself used the song as the theme for his syndicated radio music show &quot;Vinyl Tap&quot;.

=== Elvis and the TCB Band ===
During his last few years of life, Elvis Presley adopted &quot;Taking Care of Business in a Flash&quot; as a motto, abbreviated as TCB and associated with a lightning bolt. The logo can be seen on his Graceland burial site, one of his airplanes, and is still used in Elvis merchandise. His entertainment room at Graceland also shows his dedication to that motto. His last backup group was called the TCB Band, which still plays under the name. Elvis had been a major influence on Bachman, who in 2010 said he had been aware of rumours about the origins of the TCB name but had not had them confirmed until watching a documentary about Elvis in which his widow confirmed the BTO connection. In an interview with Larry London of Voice of America, Bachman commented that Elvis had recorded a version of the song but that it would probably never be released.

In 2004, Bachman rewrote the song into a Christmas version titled &quot;Takin&#x27; Care of Christmas&quot;, which was released on a holiday CD of the same title.

== In other media ==
&quot;Takin&#x27; Care of Business&quot; has been used in multiple television shows and films, giving the song more recent popularity. It inspired the title of the 1990 comedy film &quot;Taking Care of Business&quot;, for which it was the theme song, and has been used in many other films, starring with &quot;Body Slam&quot; (1986), as well as major films like &quot;The Spirit of &#x27;76&quot;, &quot;The Replacements&quot;, &quot;A Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot;, &quot;The Sandlot 2&quot;, &quot;About Schmidt&quot;, &quot;Two Weeks Notice&quot;, &quot;Daddy Day Care&quot;, the trailer for &quot;Robots&quot; as well as the documentaries &quot;Inside Job&quot; and &quot;20 to 1&quot;. It has also appeared on many television series such as &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;, &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;, &quot;That 70s Show&quot;, &quot;American Dad!&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, &quot;My Name Is Earl&quot;, &quot;Parks &amp; Recreation&quot;, &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, &quot;Cold Case&quot;, &quot;Men of a Certain Age&quot;, &quot;Supernatural&quot;, and &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot;. It also appeared twice on the Cartoon Network show &quot;Regular Show&quot;, in the episodes &quot;Tent Trouble&quot; and &quot;VIP Members Only&quot;. Also in Tom Green&#x27;s &quot;Subway Monkey Hour&quot; as he performs it in a street. The song &quot;Takin&#x27; Care of Business&quot; was also used in the commercials for Office Depot stores, which used the name of the song as the chain&#x27;s slogan in the 1990s.

A small excerpt of a cover version by Thunderpussy was used in the 2019 film &quot;Fighting with My Family&quot;.

<doc id="671353" wikidata="Q485116" url="?curid=671353" title="Mayhem (band)">
<text>Mayhem is a Norwegian black metal band formed in Oslo in 1984. They were one of the pioneers of the Norwegian black metal scene, and their music has profoundly influenced the black metal genre. Mayhem&#x27;s early career was marked by controversy, primarily due to their notorious live performances, the 1991 suicide of vocalist Per Yngve Ohlin (&quot;Dead&quot;), and the 1993 murder of guitarist Øystein Aarseth (&quot;Euronymous&quot;) by former member Varg Vikernes (&quot;Count Grishnackh&quot;) of Burzum.

The group released a demo and an EP that were highly influential, amassing a devoted following through sporadic and notorious live performances while attracting further attention due to their connections with the series of Norwegian church burnings and the incidents of violence surrounding them. Mayhem temporarily disbanded following Aarseth&#x27;s murder, shortly before the release of their debut album, &quot;De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas&quot;, which is regarded as a classic of the black metal genre. Surviving former members Jan Axel Blomberg (&quot;Hellhammer&quot;), Jørn Stubberud (&quot;Necrobutcher&quot;), and Sven Erik Kristiansen (&quot;Maniac&quot;) reformed the band in 1995, with Rune Eriksen (&quot;Blasphemer&quot;) replacing Aarseth. Attila Csihar and Morten Iversen (&quot;Teloch&quot;) have since replaced Kristiansen and Eriksen, respectively. Their post-Aarseth material is characterized by increased experimentation. The 2007 album &quot;Ordo Ad Chao&quot; received the Spellemann Award for Best Heavy Metal Album.

== History ==
=== 1984–1988: Early years ===
Mayhem was founded in 1984 by guitarist Øystein Aarseth (initially known as &quot;Destructor&quot;, later &quot;Euronymous&quot;), bassist and vocalist Jørn Stubberud (&quot;Necrobutcher&quot;), and drummer Kjetil Manheim. The band took their name from the Venom song &quot;Mayhem with Mercy&quot;. The lineup began performing cover songs by Black Sabbath, Venom and Motörhead. Once they began to write their own music, their major influences were Venom, Motörhead, Black Sabbath, Slayer, Bathory, Celtic Frost, Sarcófago, Parabellum, Hellhammer, Amebix, GBH, the Exploited, Discharge, the Misfits, Dead Kennedys, Sodom, Destruction, Tormentor, Tangerine Dream, Pink Floyd and Marillion. Soon, they recorded the demo &quot;Pure Fucking Armageddon&quot;. After its release, Aarseth and Stubberud, during the studio rehearsals for the first demo, recruited two session members, Eirik Norheim (&quot;Messiah&quot;) and Sven Erik Kristiansen (&quot;Maniac&quot;), in 1986 and 1987. Norheim performed only at one concert, which took place on 20 April 1985 in Ski, and by the end of that year, he had left Mayhem. He later formed the hardcore punk band Within Range and the Oi!/street punk band Cockroach Clan. With Kristiansen, Mayhem recorded their first EP, &quot;Deathcrush&quot;, in 1987, which was released through Euronymous&#x27; newly formed label Posercorpse Music. Manheim and Euronymous only performed at one show on 22 March 1986 at the Ski theater under the name L.E.G.O., which was recorded on video. This was a side project focused on experimental music that challenged mainstream conventions.

The initial release of &quot;Deathcrush&quot;, limited to 1,000 copies, quickly sold out. It was later reissued in 1993 by the newly renamed Deathlike Silence Productions in collaboration with Euronymous&#x27; Oslo specialist record shop Helvete (Norwegian for &quot;Hell&quot;). Manheim and Kristiansen departed from the band in 1988.

=== 1988–1991: With Dead ===
After two brief replacements, the roles of vocalist and drummer in Mayhem were filled by Swedish vocalist Pelle Yngve Ohlin (&quot;Dead&quot;) and local drummer Jan Axel Blomberg (&quot;Hellhammer&quot;). With Dead, the band&#x27;s concerts gained notoriety for their extreme theatricality and atmosphere. From the outset of his career, Dead was known for wearing &quot;corpse paint&quot;, involving the application of black and white makeup to achieve a ghastly appearance. According to Necrobutcher, &quot;it wasn&#x27;t anything to do with the way Kiss and Alice Cooper used makeup. Dead actually wanted to look like a corpse. He didn&#x27;t do it to look cool.&quot; Hellhammer asserted that Dead was &quot;the first black-metal musician to use corpse paint.&quot; To complete his corpse-like image, Dead would bury his stage clothes and dig them up to wear on concert nights.

During performances, Dead would often cut himself with hunting knives and broken glass. The band frequently featured pig or sheep heads impaled on stakes at the front of the stage.

Stian Johansen (&quot;Occultus&quot;), who briefly took over as vocalist after Dead&#x27;s suicide, commented on him: 
&quot;He [Dead] didn&#x27;t see himself as human; he saw himself as a creature from another world. He said he had many visions that his blood has frozen in his veins, that he was dead. That is the reason he took that name. He knew he would die.&quot;

In 1990, the members of Mayhem moved to &quot;an old house in the forest&quot; near Oslo, which they used as a rehearsal space. They began writing songs for their next album, &quot;De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas&quot;. Mayhem bassist Necrobutcher noted that, after living together for a time, Dead and Euronymous &quot;got on each other&#x27;s nerves a lot&quot; and &quot;weren&#x27;t really friends at the end.&quot; Hellhammer recalled an incident where Dead once went outside to sleep in the woods because Euronymous was playing synthesizer music that Dead detested. Euronymous then followed him outside, shooting into the air with a shotgun. Varg Vikernes alleged that Dead once stabbed Euronymous with a knife.

On April 8, 1991, Dead committed suicide in the house rented by the band. He was found by Euronymous, who discovered him with slit wrists and a shotgun wound to the head. Dead&#x27;s suicide note began with &quot;Excuse all the blood&quot; and included an explanation: &quot;nobody will ever understand this, but as a sort of explanation, I am not human, this is only a dream and soon I will awake.&quot; The note concluded with the phrase, &quot;I didn&#x27;t come up with this now but 17 years ago.&quot; Attached to the note were the lyrics to the song &quot;Life Eternal.&quot; Upon discovering Dead’s body, Euronymous went to a nearby store, purchased a disposable camera, and photographed the corpse after rearranging certain items.

Necrobutcher recounted Euronymous informing him about the suicide: 
Øystein called me up the next day ... and says, &quot;Dead has done something really cool! He killed himself.&quot; I thought, have you lost it? What do you mean cool? He says, &quot;Relax, I have photos of everything.&quot; I was in shock and grief. He was just thinking how to exploit it. So I told him, &quot;OK. Don&#x27;t even fucking call me before you destroy those pictures.&quot;

Euronymous subsequently used Dead&#x27;s suicide to cultivate Mayhem&#x27;s &#x27;evil&#x27; image, claiming that Dead had taken his life due to the commercialization of black metal. In time, rumors circulated that Euronymous had made a stew from bits of Dead&#x27;s brain and fashioned necklaces from fragments of his skull. The band later denied the former rumor, confirming only the latter. Moreover, Euronymous claimed to have given these necklaces to musicians he deemed worthy, a claim supported by several others in the scene, including Bård &#x27;Faust&#x27; Eithun and Jon &#x27;Metalion&#x27; Kristiansen. In 2018, a fragment of Dead&#x27;s skull went on sale for $3,500, accompanied by a letter from Euronymous stating: &quot;OK! That should be all. I&#x27;m enclosing a little piece from Dead&#x27;s cranium in case you&#x27;d like to have it. Hear from you soon!&quot; In a 2019 interview with Loudwire and Consequence of Sound, Necrobutcher stated he had contemplated killing Euronymous due to his treatment of Dead, but that Vikernes &quot;beat [him] to it.&quot;

Fans of the band have continued the trend of using blood in artwork. Notably, Hellhammer himself penned the lyrics to &quot;Pagan Fears&quot; in his own blood in October 2019.

=== 1991–1994: Murder of Euronymous, &quot;De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas&quot; and breakup ===
Dead&#x27;s suicide and Euronymous&#x27;s actions following it profoundly affected Necrobutcher, prompting him to leave Mayhem, which reduced the band to two members. The group rehearsed briefly thereafter with Occultus, who joined with plans to begin recording vocal and bass tracks for Mayhem&#x27;s debut album, &quot;De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas&quot;. However, this arrangement was short-lived; Occultus departed the band after receiving a death threat from Euronymous. In July 1993, &quot;Live in Leipzig&quot; was released as the band&#x27;s tribute to Dead.

In late 1992, recording for Mayhem&#x27;s upcoming album resumed, leading Aarseth to enlist three additional session musicians: Burzum&#x27;s Varg Vikernes (stage name &quot;Count Grishnackh&quot;), Thorns&#x27; Snorre W. Ruch (&quot;Blackthorn&quot;), who handled bass guitar and rhythm guitar respectively, and vocalist Attila Csihar, of the Hungarian black metal band Tormentor. Due to complaints from his parents, Euronymous closed his central record shop, Helvete, citing adverse media and police attention as reasons. Much of the album was recorded during the first half of 1993 at the Grieg Hall in Bergen. To coincide with the album&#x27;s release, Euronymous and Vikernes conspired to blow up Nidaros Cathedral, which is featured on the album cover. Euronymous&#x27;s murder in August 1993 brought this plan to a halt and delayed the album&#x27;s release.

On the 10th of August 1993, Vikernes murdered Euronymous. That night, Vikernes and Ruch traveled 518 km from Bergen to Euronymous&#x27;s apartment in Oslo. Upon their arrival, a confrontation ensued, culminating in Vikernes fatally stabbing Euronymous. His body was discovered outside the apartment, bearing twenty-three stab wounds—two to the head, five to the neck, and sixteen to the back. Vikernes contends that Euronymous had plotted to torture him to death and videotape the event, using a meeting about an unsigned contract as a pretext. On the night of the murder, Vikernes claims he intended to present Euronymous with the signed contract and &quot;tell him to fuck off,&quot; but that Euronymous attacked him first. Additionally, Vikernes claimed that most of Euronymous&#x27;s stab wounds were inflicted by broken glass he fell onto during the struggle. Vikernes was arrested within days, and a few months later, he was sentenced to 21 years in prison, the maximum sentence in Norway, for both the murder and church arsons; he was released from prison in 2009. Blackthorn, who waited for Vikernes downstairs and played no role in Aarseth&#x27;s murder, was charged with complicity and sentenced to eight years in prison. With only Attila and Hellhammer remaining, Mayhem effectively ceased to exist.

In a video interview with Consequence of Sound on 15 October 2019, Necrobutcher discussed his lingering bitterness toward Euronymous after being replaced in the band by Varg Vikernes prior to the recording of &quot;De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas&quot;. He recounted his thoughts on Euronymous&#x27;s murder, stating that:

&quot;OK, I can tell it right now, because I&#x27;ve been holding it in for many years, but actually I was on my way down to kill him myself. And when it happened, I saw the morning paper, thinking &#x27;Fuck, I gotta get home to my place and get out all the weapons and drugs and shit I had in my house, because they&#x27;re coming to my house because I&#x27;m probably going to be the No. 1 suspect for this.&#x27; But little did I know that the Norwegian police already knew that Count Grishnackh [Varg] was going down also to kill him. Because they bugged his phone, and he actually talked about this killing before he went to Bergen so the cops already knew that he was coming, so they probably were thinking to themselves, &#x27;We didn&#x27;t nail this guy for the church burnings, so let&#x27;s nail him for murder, and get rid of this fucking guy in Oslo the same time.&#x27; So that&#x27;s basically what happened.&quot;

In May 1994, &quot;De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas&quot; was released and dedicated to Euronymous. Its release had been postponed due to objections raised by Euronymous&#x27;s parents, who protested the inclusion of bass guitar parts performed by Vikernes. According to Vikernes, Hellhammer assured Aarseth&#x27;s parents that he would re-record the bass tracks himself; however, being unable to play bass guitar, Hellhammer left the bass tracks unchanged, resulting in the album featuring Vikernes as bassist.

=== 1995–2004: Reunion with Maniac and Necrobutcher and introduction of Blasphemer ===
In 1995, a bootleg live recording of a 1990 Mayhem concert was released, titled &quot;The Dawn of the Black Hearts&quot;. Despite its bootleg status, the album is sometimes considered one of the band&#x27;s main releases, primarily due to the notoriety surrounding its cover art, which features one of the aforementioned photographs of Dead shortly after he died by suicide.

Around this time, Hellhammer, Maniac, and Necrobutcher reformed the band with new guitarist Rune Eriksen (&quot;Blasphemer&quot;) in place of Euronymous. Despite generating some controversy and skepticism over the decision to reform without founding member Euronymous, the group returned with the 1997 &quot;Wolf&#x27;s Lair Abyss&quot; EP.

In this new phase, statements from Hellhammer (who expressed views against race mixing and foreigners in Norway) and the use of Nazi imagery, such as swastika flags in the rehearsal room, the Totenkopf emblem and band merchandise featuring the symbol of the military branch of Nasjonal Samling led to controversy and accusations of neo-Nazism.

Additionally, Hellhammer stated that no member of the new line-up identified as a Satanist, and that the &quot;Satanic stuff […] isn&#x27;t what I feel Mayhem is about today. […] Mayhem&#x27;s music is still dark, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s Satanic.&quot;

The band&#x27;s second full-length album, &quot;Grand Declaration of War&quot;, was released in 2000. Strongly influenced by progressive and avant-garde metal, with Maniac partially abandoning the traditional black metal rasp in favor of dramatic spoken-word monologues, the album was concept-based, exploring themes of war and post-apocalyptic destruction. 

Mayhem made headlines in 2003 when fan Per Kristian Hagen suffered a fractured skull after being struck by a severed sheep&#x27;s head that had been thrown into the audience from the stage. Assault charges were filed, but the band maintained that it was entirely accidental.

The band released &quot;Chimera&quot; in 2004, marking a return to their initial raw sound while incorporating higher production value and a progressive edge.

Later that year, Maniac left the band. According to Necrobutcher, this departure was due to his alcoholism, which was exacerbated by stage fright. Necrobutcher explained that due to this tendency, a violent altercation between the singer and Blasphemer led to the guitarist kicking Maniac down a flight of stairs, resulting in injury. Csihar was reinstated as his replacement.

=== 2004–2008: Return of Csihar; &quot;Ordo Ad Chao&quot; ===
The band&#x27;s fourth full-length album, &quot;Ordo ad Chao&quot; (Latin for &quot;Order to Chaos&quot;), was released in April 2007. &quot;Ordo ad Chao&quot; featured a much rawer sound compared to the band&#x27;s recent work; the drums were not equalized, and the mix was notably bass-heavy, deviating from black metal conventions. The album continued the band&#x27;s experimentation with unorthodox song structures, highlighted by &quot;Illuminate Eliminate,&quot; which, at 9:40, is the band&#x27;s second longest track (behind &quot;Grand Declaration of War&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Completion in Science of Agony (Part I)&quot; at 9:44). The album received strong reviews and became the band&#x27;s highest-charting release, peaking at No. 12 on the Norwegian charts. In early 2008, &quot;Ordo Ad Chao&quot; won a Spellemannprisen, an award from Norway&#x27;s largest and oldest music awards show, for one of the best Metal Album of 2007.

=== 2008–2015: Blasphemer&#x27;s Departure and &quot;Esoteric Warfare&quot; ===
In April 2008, Blasphemer announced his intention to leave the band, citing a lack of desire to continue despite his satisfaction with their achievements. He played several European festival dates over the following months, with his final performance with the group occurring in August. Subsequently, he continued his work with the Portuguese band Ava Inferi.

A few weeks after their last performances with Blasphemer, statements regarding imminent touring plans were posted on the band&#x27;s website. In October 2008, Krister Dreyer (&quot;Morfeus&quot;) of Dimension F3H and Limbonic Art joined the group as the touring guitarist for their upcoming South America Fucking Armageddon tour. The band toured with this lineup through late 2008 and 2009 before announcing Summer 2009 dates with French musician Silmaeth as a second touring guitarist. In November 2009, the band was arrested in Tilburg, Netherlands, for vandalizing a hotel room while on tour. Norwegian guitarist Teloch of Nidingr replaced Silmaeth, while British guitarist Charles Hedger (aka Ghul) of Imperial Vengeance took over for Morfeus in 2011 and 2012.

In a 2012 interview, Necrobutcher revealed that Mayhem had commenced work on their fifth studio album. By November 2013, the new album was in the mixing stage, with an expected release date in early 2014. Several months later, on 18 February 2014, it was announced that Mayhem would release a new album in May 2014, with a new song titled &quot;Psywar&quot; made available for streaming.

On 20 February 2014, the band&#x27;s record label, Season of Mist, announced that the new album &quot;Esoteric Warfare&quot; would be released worldwide on 27 May 2014. This marked Mayhem&#x27;s first studio effort since Blasphemer&#x27;s departure and Teloch&#x27;s subsequent permanent status in the band.

In January 2015, Mayhem, Watain, and Revenge performed together as part of the &quot;Black Metal Warfare&quot; tour in the United States. Mayhem and Watain toured again in the United States in November 2015, joined by Rotting Christ for &quot;Part II&quot; of the previous tour.

=== 2016–2020: Live album, &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot; Film and &quot;Daemon&quot; ===
A live recording of &quot;De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas&quot; (&quot;DMDS Alive&quot;) was released in 2016.

Later that year, a film about the band, &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot; (based on the book of the same name), premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, directed by Jonas Åkerlund, further propelling the group into the media spotlight. While the film received mixed reviews from both critics and fans, band members Necrobutcher and Csihar strongly objected to the movie, despite initially granting the rights to use the band&#x27;s songs. In several interviews, the two argued that the film presented a one-sided perspective of the story, particularly criticizing its failure to depict the deteriorating relationship between Euronymous and Dead in the year leading up to the latter&#x27;s suicide in April 1991. In 2018, the band released a remixed and remastered version of &quot;A Grand Declaration of War&quot;.

Mayhem&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Daemon&quot;, was released on 25 October 2019 through Century Media Records. Three singles—&quot;Worthless Abominations Destroyed&quot;, &quot;Of Worms and Ruins&quot;, and &quot;Falsified and Hated&quot;—were released in advance of the album. The album is characterized by a return to the more traditional style of black metal reminiscent of &quot;De Mysteriis&quot;, containing 10 new songs along with two bonus tracks and several covers, including a tribute to Dead&#x27;s former band &quot;Morbid&quot;. A music video for &quot;Falsified and Hated&quot; was released on 7 November and features imagery of what appears to be a shaking tent ritual, including a scene of a heart being cut open. Ziggy Jonas Rasmusson, a graffiti artist, contributed to the design.

In 2020, it was announced that drummer Tony Laureano would temporarily fill in for Hellhammer on the Decibel Magazine Tour due to Hellhammer suffering from a shoulder injury. However, the tour was ultimately canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== 2021–present: &quot;Atavistic Black Disorder / Kommando&quot; ===
In 2021, Mayhem was inducted into the Rockheim Hall of Fame, marking their third nomination earlier that same year. As of 2021, they are the only black metal group to receive this honor.

Mayhem announced the release of a new EP, &quot;Atavistic Black Disorder / Kommando&quot;, on 9 July 2021. The track listing includes three outtakes from the &quot;Daemon&quot; sessions, two of which were featured as bonus tracks on the deluxe edition of the album, along with four cover songs from punk rock bands that the group cites as having &quot;laid the foundation for what was to come.&quot; The EP features guest appearances by former vocalists Messiah and Maniac on one cover track each. This marks the first studio recordings for Messiah and Maniac with the band since 1987&#x27;s &quot;Deathcrush&quot; and 2004&#x27;s &quot;Chimera&quot;, respectively. Necrobutcher stated that the two former vocalists were brought in &quot;because of their obvious connection with punk.&quot;

Mayhem also announced a 2022 United States tour, titled &quot;The Sanguine Sodomy of North America&quot;, which began on March 7 with a show in San Francisco, California, and was projected to conclude on April 3 after a performance in Joliet, Illinois. However, on March 4, Watain announced that they would not be able to participate in the tour due to a United States embassy &quot;decid[ing] to launch an additional, undisclosed &#x27;administrative process&#x27; in relation to [their] visa applications.&quot;

<text>The Indian paradise flycatcher (Terpsiphone paradisi) is a medium-sized passerine bird native to Asia, where it is widely distributed. As the global population is considered stable, it has been listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 2004. It is native to the Indian subcontinent, Central Asia and Myanmar.

Males have elongated central tail feathers, and a black and rufous plumage in some populations, while others have white plumage. Females are short-tailed with rufous wings and a black head. Indian paradise flycatchers feed on insects, which they capture in the air often below a densely canopied tree.

==Taxonomy==

The Indian paradise flycatcher was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Corvus paradisi&quot;. The Indian paradise flycatcher is now one of 17 paradise flycatchers placed in the genus &quot;Terpsiphone&quot; that was introduced in 1827 by the German zoologist Constantin Gloger. Paradise-flycatchers were formerly classified with the Old World flycatcher in the family Muscicapidae, but are now placed in the family Monarchidae together with monarch flycatchers. Until 2015, the Indian paradise flycatcher, Blyth&#x27;s paradise flycatcher, and the Amur paradise flycatcher were all considered conspecific, and together called Asian paradise flycatcher.

===Subspecies===

Three subspecies are recognized:
* &quot;T. p. paradisi&quot; breeds in central and southern India, central Bangladesh, and south-western Myanmar; populations occurring in Sri Lanka in the winter season are non-breeding.
* Himalayan paradise flycatcher (&quot;T. p. leucogaster&quot;) was initially described as a separate species. It breeds in the western Tian Shan, Afghanistan, northern Pakistan, and northwestern and central India, and western and central Nepal; populations in eastern Pakistan and in southern India migrate towards the foothills of the Himalayas in spring for breeding.
* Ceylon paradise flycatcher (&quot;T. p. ceylonensis&quot;) occurs in Sri Lanka.

==Description==

Adult Indian paradise flycatchers are long. Their heads are glossy black with a black crown and crest, their black bill round and sturdy, and their eyes black. Females are rufous on the back with a greyish throat and underparts. Their wings are long. Young males look very much like females but have a black throat and blue-ringed eyes. As adults, they develop up to long tail feathers with two central tail feathers growing up to long drooping streamers.

Young males are rufous and have short tails. They acquire long tails in their second or third year. Adult males are either predominantly bright rufous above or predominantly white. Some specimens show some degree of intermediacy between rufous and white. Long-tailed rufous birds are generally devoid of shaft streaks on the wing and tail feathers, while in white birds the shaft streaks, and sometimes the edges of the wing and tail feathers are black.

In the early 1960s, 680 long-tailed males were examined that are contained in collections of the British Museum of Natural History, Chicago Natural History Museum, Peabody Museum, Carnegie Museum, American Museum of Natural History, United States National Museum, and Royal Ontario Museum. The specimens came from almost the entire range of the species, though some areas were poorly represented. The relative frequency of the rufous and white plumage types varies geographically. Rufous birds are rare in the extreme southeastern part of the species&#x27; range. Throughout the Indian area and, to a lesser extent, in China, asymmetrically patterned intermediates occur. Intermediates are rare or absent throughout the rest of the range of the species. In general, long-tailed males are
* predominantly rufous with some white in wings and tail — collected in Turkestan, Kashmir, northern India, Punjab, Maharashtra, Sikkim, and in Sri Lanka;
* predominantly rufous with some white in wings — collected in Iran, Afghanistan, Baluchistan, Punjab, Kashmir, northern and central India, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Bihar, and Nepal;
* predominantly rufous with some white in tail — collected in Punjab, northern and central India, Kolkata, Sri Lanka, and in the Upper Yangtze Valley in China;
* predominantly white with some rufous in tail and wings — collected in Kashmir, Maharashtra, Sichuan, and North China;
* predominantly white with some rufous in tail — collected in Maharashtra and Fuzhou, China;
* predominantly white with back partly rufous — collected in Punjab and Chennai;
* moulting from rufous into white plumage — collected in North Bihar.
Possible interpretations of this phenomenon are: males may be polymorphic for rufous and white plumage colour; rufous birds may be sub-adults; and there may even be two sympatric species distinguishable only in the male.

==Distribution and habitat==

The Indian paradise flycatcher is a migratory bird and spends the winter season in tropical Asia. In southern India and Sri Lanka especially the highlands and western parts of Sri Lanka, both locally breeding populations and visiting migrants occur in winter.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Indian paradise flycatcher&#x27;s breeding season lasts from May to July. Being socially monogamous, both males and females take part in nest-building, incubation, brooding, and feeding of the young. The incubation period lasts 14 to 16 days and the nestling period 9 to 12 days. The nest is sometimes built in the vicinity of a breeding pair of drongos, which keep predators away. The female lays up to four eggs in a neat cup nest made with twigs and spider webs on the end of a low branch. Chicks hatch in about 21 to 23 days. A case of interspecific feeding has been noted with paradise flycatcher chicks fed by Indian white-eyes.

==In culture==
This bird is the state bird of Madhya Pradesh and is referred to as &quot;Doodhraj&quot; locally,

This bird is mentioned in Satyajit Ray&#x27;s Feluda detective stories &quot;Chinnamastar Abhishap&quot; and &quot;Jahangirer Swarnamudra&quot;.

* Languages: (2016) 54.9% French, 23.5% English, 4.9% Yiddish, 2.7% Spanish, 2.4% Arabic, 1.5% Farsi, 1.1% Portuguese, 0.9% Greek, 0.9% Romanian, 0.8% Tagalog, 0.8% Russian, 0.8% Mandarin, 0.6% Vietnamese

== Geography ==
The district includes the borough of Outremont, the eastern part of Côte-des-Neiges in the borough of Côte-des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, and the western part of Mile End in the borough of Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, plus bits of upper Downtown Montreal in the borough of Ville-Marie, La Petite-Patrie in the borough of Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie, and Parc Extension in the borough of Villeray–Saint-Michel–Parc-Extension.

==Political geography==
In the 2006 election, the Liberals had their strongest support in Côte-des-Neiges, on the eastern slopes of Mont-Royal and in the small part of the riding in the Parc-Extension neighbourhood. The Bloc had its support concentrated in the borough of Outremont, and around the Université de Montréal. The New Democratic Party (NDP) won all of its polls in Mile-End where it obtained most of its polls. The Conservatives won just three polls in the riding all of which were around the western border of the Outremont border.

In the 2007 by-election, the NDP almost swept the riding. Their strongest areas were in Mile-End, Jeanne-Mance, and around the Université de Montréal. It was not uncommon for the NDP win more than 70% of the vote in these polls. The Bloc Québécois vote had collapsed, most of which went to the NDP. They did not win a single poll. Liberal support was relegated to the small part of Parc-Extension in the riding, the area around Rue Jean-Talon and the area on the opposite side of Mount Royal along Avenue des Pins. The Conservatives held on to one of their three polls.

In the 2008 election, the NDP held on to Outremont, albeit with a lower percentage of overall support.

Until the 2011 election, this riding was the only riding in Quebec to be held by the NDP. Mulcair held it since winning a by-election in 2007, earning a Quebec seat for the party for only the second time in history. He was challenged in 2011 by Liberal Martin Cauchon, who held this riding from 1993 to 2004 and was a former cabinet minister.

== History ==
The electoral district was created in 1933 from parts of Laurier—Outremont and Mount Royal ridings.

This riding lost territory to Papineau, Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Westmount, Laurier—Sainte-Marie, Ville-Marie—Le Sud-Ouest—Île-des-Sœurs and Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie, and gained territory from Laurier—Sainte-Marie, Westmount—Ville-Marie and Mount Royal during the 2012 electoral redistribution.

=== 2007 by-election ===
After the resignation of Jean Lapierre on 28 January 2007, a by-election was called for 17 September 2007. In the by-election, this riding was won by the NDP candidate Thomas Mulcair.

Mulcair retained the riding for the NDP in the 2008 federal election, marking the NDP&#x27;s first re-election and first general election victory in Quebec.

<doc id="671365" wikidata="Q1075277" url="?curid=671365" title="Ritornello">
<text>A ritornello (Italian; &quot;little return&quot;) is a recurring passage in Renaissance music and Baroque music for orchestra or chorus. 

==Early history==
The earliest use of the term &quot;ritornello&quot; in music referred to the final lines of a fourteenth-century madrigal, which were usually in a rhyme scheme and meter that contrasted with the rest of the song. Scholars suggest that the word &quot;ritornello&quot; comes either from the Italian word &quot;ritorno&quot; (meaning return), or from &quot;tornando&quot; (meaning turnaround or flourish). Literally, in Italian it means &quot;little return&quot;.

==Baroque music==
The ritornello as a recurring tutti passage can be traced back to the music of sixteenth-century Venetian composer Giovanni Gabrieli. According to Richard Taruskin, these repeating passages are &quot;endemic to the &quot;concertato&quot; style&quot; which Gabrieli is credited with developing.

The idea of an orchestral ritornello played an important role in the structure of opera in the eighteenth century. The most common form for an aria during the Baroque period was da capo form, which essentially consisted of an A section followed by a contrasting B section, which was in turn followed by a return of the A section. Many &quot;da capo&quot; arias could be subdivided further, with ritornello sections framing each of the singer&#x27;s solo sections, forming the scheme | R--A1—R--A2—R | B | R--A1—R--A2—R ||.

The ritornello was also crucial in the development of the Italian instrumental concerto during the Baroque period. Giuseppe Torelli wrote many violin concertos in which the fast movements used a recurring ritornello in between two extended solo passages of entirely new material. This form was standardized by Antonio Vivaldi, who wrote hundreds of concertos using a modification of Torelli&#x27;s scheme. Vivaldi&#x27;s ritornello form established a set of conventions followed by later composers in the eighteenth century:
*Ritornellos for the full orchestra alternate with episodes for the soloist or soloists.
*The opening ritornello is composed of several small units, typically two to four measures in length, some of which may be repeated or varied. These segments can be separated from each other or combined in new ways without losing their identity as the ritornello. 
*Later statements of the ritornello are usually partial, comprising only one or some of the units, sometimes varied.
*The ritornellos are guideposts to the tonal structure of the music, confirming the keys to which the music modulates. The first and last statements are in the tonic; at least one (usually the first to be in a new key) is in the dominant; and others may be in closely related keys.

In these visits to different keys, ritornello form differs from the later Classical form rondo, in which the recurring section remains in the same key. Vivaldi also established a convention of using ritornello form for the quick opening and closing movements, with a contrasting slow movement in between. Many later Baroque composers such as Bach and Telemann followed Vivaldi&#x27;s models in composing their own concertos.

Some scholars argue that &quot;ritornello form quickly disappeared as a general constructive principle&quot; in the early years of the nineteenth century, due to the structural innovations of Beethoven. Others such as William Caplin suggest that the ritornello form did not disappear, but &quot;was transformed into concerto form through the incorporation of classical formal functions, especially those associated with the sonata.&quot; Caplin argues that the outlines of ritornello form persist in the alternation of solo and tutti sections, albeit subsumed within the tonal and formal plan of the sonata.

Ritornello construction faded with the advent of the new sonata form but received renewed interest in the 20th century.

<text>Lemuel Cook (September 10, 1759 – May 20, 1866) was one of the last verifiable surviving veterans of the American Revolutionary War.

==Early life and education==
Cook was born on September 10, 1759, in Litchfield County, Connecticut, to Henry Cook and his wife Hannah Benham.

==Military service==
Cook enlisted in the Continental Army in 1775 at the age of 16. He was assigned to the 2nd Continental Light Dragoons, and by his death he was the last surviving member. He fought at Brandywine and in the Virginian campaign, and was wounded several times. He was present at Charles Cornwallis&#x27; surrender in October 1781. He received an honorable discharge signed by George Washington on June 12, 1784.

==Later life and death==
Following the war, Cook became a farmer and married Hannah Curtis. They had seven sons and three daughters.

He was an active Mason and Democrat since the party’s establishment in 1828. His church was Congregational. He lived in Plymouth, Connecticut (then Northbury) until 1790, when he moved to Clinton, New York. In 1795 he returned to Plymouth, then moved to Pompey, New York in 1805. He moved to North Bergen, New York in 1821 and finally to Clarendon, New York in 1832.

Lemuel was one of the oldest and among the last living pensioners of the American Revolution. He died May 20, 1866, at the age of 106, having lived to see the start and the end of the American Civil War. He was buried with full military and Masonic honors. At the time of his death, only three other revolutionary veterans (Samuel Downing, Daniel F. Bakeman and John Gray) were still alive.

<doc id="671396" wikidata="Q3551174" url="?curid=671396" title="Ibaloi people">
<text>The Ibaloi (also spelled Ibaloy; Ibaloi: &quot;ivadoy&quot;, ) are an indigenous ethnic group found in Benguet province of the northern Philippines. &quot;Ibaloi&quot; is derived from &quot;i-&quot;, a prefix signifying &quot;pertaining to&quot; and &quot;badoy&quot; or house, together then meaning &quot;people who live in houses&quot;. The Ibaloi are one of the indigenous peoples collectively known as Igorot (&quot;igudut&quot;, &quot;hill-dwellers&quot;), who live in the Cordillera Central of Luzon.

== Distribution ==
The Ibaloi inhabit the southeastern part of Benguet Province. The area is rich in mineral resources like copper, gold, pyrite, and limestone. Plants and animals are also abundant in the forests and mountain areas, and there is an extensive water system that includes the Bued River, Agno River, and Amburayan River. Mount Pulag, the third highest mountain of the Philippines, is found in their territory and is a culturally important area as well, considered the place where spirits join their ancestors.

The Ibaloi are distributed in the mountain valleys and settlements. Ancestral land claims by Ibaloi communities include parts of Baguio.

== Language ==
The native language of the Ibaloi people is Ibaloi, also known as Inibaloi or Nabaloi. It has three dialects: Bokod, Daklan and Kabayan. The Ibaloi often also speak Ilocano and Tagalog as a second language.

== Culture ==

Ibaloi society is composed of the rich (&quot;baknang&quot;) and three poor classes, the cowhands (&quot;pastol&quot;), farmhands (&quot;silbi&quot;), and non-Ibaloi slaves (&quot;bagaen&quot;).

The Ibaloi have a rich material culture, most notably their mummification process, which makes use of saltwater to prevent organ decomposition. Pounded guava and patani leaves are applied to the corpse to prevent maggot or worm infestation while the body dries, the process taking anywhere from two months to even a year until the body is hardened.

The Ibaloi build their houses (&quot;balai&quot; or &quot;baeng&quot;) near their farms. These are usually built on five foot posts (&quot;tokod&quot;) and contain only one room with no windows. Pine trees are usually used to build the houses, especially for wealthy families, while bark bamboo for floors and walls, and cogon grass for roofs (&quot;atup&quot;), are used by the poor. For cooking, they use pots are made of copper (&quot;kambung&quot;), and food compartments (&quot;shuyu&quot;) and utensils made of wood. Baskets and coconut shells are also used as containers. A wooden box filled with soil serves as the cooking place (&quot;Shapolan&quot;), and three stones as the stove (&quot;shakilan&quot;). Traditional weapons of the Ibalois are the spear (&quot;kayang&quot;), shield (&quot;kalasai&quot;), bow and arrow (&quot;bekang&quot; and &quot;pana&quot;), and war club (&quot;papa&quot;), though they are rarely used in present times. The Ibaloi also employ cutting tools like knives, farm tools, and complete pounding implements for rice: mortars (&quot;dohsung&quot;), which are round or rectangular for different purposes, and pestles (&quot;al-o&quot; or &quot;bayu&quot;)of various sizes, carved from sturdy tree trunks and pine branches. Their rice winnower (&quot;dega-o&quot; or &quot;kiyag&quot;) are made of bamboo or rattan.

Music is also important among the Ibaloi, with the Jew&#x27;s harp (&quot;kodeng&quot;), nose flute (&quot;kulesheng&quot;), native guitar (&quot;kalsheng&quot; or &quot;Kambitong&quot;), bamboo striking instruments, drums (&quot;solibao&quot;), gongs (&quot;kalsa&quot;), and many others. They are considered sacred, and must always be played for a reason, such as a cañao feast.

Men wear a g-string (&quot;kuval&quot;), and the wealthy include a dark blue blanket (&quot;kulabaw&quot; or &quot;alashang&quot;) while the rest use a white one (&quot;kolebao dja oles&quot;). Women wear a blouse (&quot;kambal&quot;) and a skirt (&quot;aten&quot; or &quot;divet&quot;). Gold-plated teeth covers (&quot;shikang&quot;), copper leglets (&quot;batding&quot;), copper bracelets (&quot;karing&quot;), and ear pendants (&quot;tabing&quot;) reflect the benefits of mining for gold and copper. Lode or placer mining is followed by ore crushing using a large flat stone (&quot;gai-dan&quot;) and a small one (&quot;alidan&quot;). The gold in the resultant fine sand is then separated (&quot;sabak&quot;) in a water trough (&quot;dayasan&quot;). The gold is then melted into cakes.

Older Ibaloi people may have tattooed arms as a sign of prestige.

Because of fertile soils and climate of Benguet, the Ibaloi are predominantly farmers. There are two varieties of rice. These are the kintoman and talon. The kintoman is the red variety of rice that is long grained, tastier and comes in various forms; the balatin-naw which is soft and sticky when cooked, the shaya-ut which is also soft, and the putaw which is slightly rough on the palate when eaten. This variety of rice is also used to make the native rice wine called tafey. The second variety of rice, the talon, on the other hand, is the white lowland type that is planted during the rainy season. Ibalois also plant root crops like camote, gabi, cassava and potatoes. Vegetation includes cabbage, celery and pechay. There are also several kinds of wild mushrooms in addition to fruits like avocados, bananas and mangoes grown in many areas. Meat consumed includes pigs, cows, goats and chickens as well as wild deer (olsa), wild pigs (alimanok) and big lizard (tilay). Lastly, the Ibaloi consume fish from the few rivers in their area.

Smoked pork called &quot;kinuday&quot; is a prominent food for the Ibaloi people.

==Religion==
Many Ibalois are now Christians of various denominations, though many of them still practice traditional Ibaloi faith.

The Ibaloi believe in two kinds of spirits (&quot;anitos&quot;). The nature spirits are associated with calamities, while the ancestral ones (&quot;ka-apuan&quot;) make their presence known in dreams or by making a family member sick.

<text>Papineau (formerly Papineau—Saint-Denis and Papineau—Saint-Michel) is a federal electoral district in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1948. Its population in 2016 was 110,750. Justin Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada and Leader of the Liberal Party, has represented the riding since the 2008 federal election. Trudeau became Liberal leader in a 2013 leadership election, succeeding Bob Rae, and prime minister when the Liberals returned to government in the 2015 Canadian federal election, succeeding Conservative leader Stephen Harper.

The name of the riding comes from a street in the Villeray neighbourhood, named after Joseph Papineau.

At , it covers the second smallest area of any federal riding in Canada after Toronto Centre. Linguistically, 45% of residents list French as their mother tongue, 8% list English, and 47% list neither English nor French, with large groups speaking Spanish, Italian, Urdu, Hindi, Punjabi, Pashtu, Bengali, Greek, and Arabic. Immigrants make up 40 percent of the riding&#x27;s population.

==Geography==
The district includes the neighbourhoods of Villeray and Park Extension, as well as the southern part of the old city of Saint-Michel in the Borough of Villeray–Saint-Michel–Parc-Extension.
The southwest corner of the riding borders the Outremont riding, held by Rachel Bendayan of the Liberal Party of Canada.

===Political geography===
Papineau, despite its small size, is a very divided riding. The riding spans the former linguistic divide of the city, Saint Laurent Boulevard. South of the riding is the neighbourhood of Park Extension, which is very Liberal. The central part of the riding, around Villeray, was Bloc Québécois territory for almost two decades before swinging heavily to the NDP in the 2011 federal election. Meanwhile, François-Perreault district, in the south of Saint-Michel, is considered swing territory between the Liberals and the NDP. The district of Saint-Michel, which is part of neighbouring Saint-Léonard—Saint-Michel riding to the northeast of Papineau, leans to the Liberals.

Except for the years 2006 to 2008, when it was held by Vivian Barbot of the Bloc, the seat has been in Liberal hands since 1953.

==Demographics==

:&quot;According to the 2016 Canadian census&quot;

* Twenty most common mother tongue languages (2016) : 49.7% French, 6.6% Spanish, 6.5% English, 5.9% Arabic, 4.2% Greek, 3.4% Italian, 2.7% Vietnamese, 2.4% Creole languages, 2.2% Punjabi, 2.1% Portuguese, 1.8% Bengali, 1.8% Urdu, 1.5% Tamil, 1.1% Cantonese, 1.0% Gujarati, 0.6% Mandarin, 0.6% Kabyle, 0.5% Khmer, 0.5% Turkish, 0.3% Polish, 0.3% Russian

==History==
The electoral district of Papineau was created in 1947 from parts of the Hochelaga, Mercier, St. James and Saint-Denis ridings.

It was renamed Papineau-Saint-Michel in 1987 and Papineau-Saint-Denis in 1994. It was shortened back to &quot;Papineau&quot; in 2003.

This riding gained territory from Outremont and Saint-Léonard—Saint-Michel during the 2012 electoral redistribution.

<doc id="671406" wikidata="Q7789077" url="?curid=671406" title="Thomas Dudley Cabot">
<text>Thomas Dudley Cabot (May 1, 1897 – June 8, 1995) was an American businessman. He also became the U.S. Department of State&#x27;s Director of Office of International Security Affairs.

==Early life==
Cabot was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His father was Godfrey Lowell Cabot, founder of Cabot Corporation and a philanthropist. His mother was Maria Moors Cabot. Cabot was named after Thomas Dudley, the governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony who signed the charter creating Harvard College. Two of his siblings were John Moors Cabot (b. 1901), U.S. Ambassador to Sweden, Colombia, Brazil, and Poland during the Eisenhower and Kennedy administration, and Eleanor Cabot of the Eleanor Cabot Bradley Estate.

Cabot graduated from Browne &amp; Nichols School in 1913. He took some courses at Boston Tech (now known as Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and Curtiss Flying School, becoming a World War I flight instructor at Kelly Field in the U.S. Army Signal Corps, before graduating cum laude from Harvard University with a SB in Engineering, in 1919.

==Career==
Upon graduation, Cabot started working for Cabot Corporation, founded by his father. He was CEO of Cabot Corporation from 1922 to 1960, when he relinquished active control of the company, and went to his Boston office as director emeritus on a regular basis until his death.

Cabot was also a longtime director of United Fruit Company, and became its president in 1948 in hopes of reformation, but resigned in 1949. His brother John Moors Cabot was a major shareholder of United Fruit, as was another family member, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., who also served as a director of United Fruit.

In 1951, Cabot was U.S. Department of State&#x27;s Director of Office of International Security Affairs during the Truman administration, where he spoke for the State Department on NATO affairs, was in charge of a U.S. program arming allies throughout the world, and supervised the disbursement of $6 billion in foreign economic and military aid. In 1953, he also served as consultant on a special development mission in Egypt. 

In 1960, a Central Intelligence Agency cover called Gibraltar Steamship Company (which didn&#x27;t own any steamships and whose president was Cabot) owned and established Radio Swan on Swan Island, a covert black operation to win supporters for U.S. policies and discredit Fidel Castro.

Cabot, his brother John Moors Cabot, another family member Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., and Cabot&#x27;s son, Louis Wellington Cabot, were all Council on Foreign Relations members inducted in 1992.

===Philanthropic work===
Cabot also served on the Harvard Board of Overseers, was a Director of the Harvard Alumni Association and significant benefactor of the university, and recipient of a Harvard Medal and honorary Doctor of Laws degree in 1970. In 1985, Harvard&#x27;s Cabot House was named in honor of Cabot and his wife. The Cabot Science Complex is also named in their honor.

Cabot had many ties to MIT and was the longest serving member of the MIT Corporation, serving for 49 consecutive years. He was elected a Life Member of the Corporation in 1951 and Life Member Emeritus in 1972. As part of his MIT Corporation work he served on many Corporation Standing and Visiting Committees.

He established the Thomas Dudley Cabot Scholarship Fund at MIT in 1960 and in 1977 members of his family honored him by endowing the Thomas Dudley Cabot Institute Chair. He and his wife established the Thomas D. and Virginia W. Cabot chair, in 1986, following his family&#x27;s legacy of MIT involvement. His grandfather, Dr. Samuel Cabot, was a Boston citizen who supported the founding of MIT and his father, Godfrey L. Cabot, graduated from MIT in 1881. Godfrey L. Cabot also supported the Institute by establishing the Godfrey L. Cabot Solar Energy Fund.

<doc id="671408" wikidata="Q142872" url="?curid=671408" title="Yuefu">
<text>Yuefu are Chinese poems composed in a folk song style. The term originally literally meant &quot;Music Bureau&quot;, a reference to the imperial Chinese governmental organization(s) originally charged with collecting or writing the lyrics, later the term &quot;yuefu&quot; was applied to later literary imitations or adaptations of the Music Bureau&#x27;s poems. The use of &quot;fu&quot; in &quot;yuefu&quot; is different from the other Chinese term &quot;fu&quot; that refers to a type of poetry or literature: although homonyms in English, the other &quot;fu&quot; () is a rhapsodic poetry/prose form of literature.

The term &quot;yuefu&quot; covers original folk songs, court imitations and versions by known poets (such as those of Li Bai). As opposed to what appears to be more of an authentic anonymous folk verse which was collected by the Music Bureau, verse written deliberately in this style, often by known authors, is often referred to as &quot;literary &quot;yuefu&quot;&quot;. The lines of the &quot;yuefu&quot; can be of uneven length, reflecting its origins as a type of fixed-rhythm verse derived from now lost folk ballad tunes; although, later, the five-character fixed-line length became common. However, as a term of classification &quot;yuefu&quot; has a certain elusiveness when it comes to strict definition. Furthermore, the literary application of the term &quot;yuefu&quot; in the modern sense of a classical form of poetry seems not to have had contemporary application until considerably after the end of the Han dynasty, thus adding a certain historically ambiguity due to its use in this literary sense not having occurred until centuries after the actual development of this type of verse itself. The use of the term &quot;yuefu&quot; to generically refer to this form of poetry does not seem to appear until the late fifth century CE.

==Origin==

The word &quot;yuefu&quot; came first into being in Qin dynasty (221 BC – 206 BC). Yue (樂) means &quot;music&quot;, &quot;fu&quot; (府) means &quot;bureau&quot;: put together &quot;yuefu&quot; means &quot;Music Bureau&quot;. &quot;Yuefu&quot; is particularly associated with the Han poetry of the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD), and became a royal government-managed music involving collecting, writing or performing folk songs and ballads in 112 BC. Afterwards, people called poems composed in this folk song style &quot;yuefu&quot;.

==Music Bureau yuefu==
The yuefu poems of the Han dynasty have been held in high regard over the history of Chinese poetry. The Han yuefu tradition inherited the traditional realistic approach of the &quot;Shi Jing&quot;&#x27;s, &quot;feeling of funeral music, causes behind the affairs&quot;. Folk songs collected or written by the Musical Department in the Han dynasty were typically done from the perspective of a certain set of personas—vividly and visually mirroring the perceived typical characters of people whose lives mirrored the different social roles which typified the society of the Han dynasty.

==Literary yuefu==

===Han dynasty===
During the last century or two of the Han dynasty, the poets of the time were noted for writing &quot;literary yuefu&quot;, that is yuefu inspired by or imitating the Music Bureau pieces.

===Jian&#x27;an===
During the Jian&#x27;an period at the end of the Han dynasty and into the Three Kingdoms period yuefu continued to be written. Often, the yuefu appearing in Jian&#x27;an poetry more personally emotional than the Music Bureau pieces.

===Six Dynasties===
During the Six Dynasties era, a form of &quot;yuefu&quot; using regular five-character quatrains (or paired couplets) similar to the &quot;jueju&quot; appears in the Midnight Songs poetry.

==New yuefu==
During the Tang dynasty certain poets wrote a series of new poems in great variety and profoundness influenced by even sometimes to the point of recycling the old titles and themes of yuefu of the Han dynasty. The poets behind this &quot;new yuefu&quot; style included many famous poets, such as Li Bai, Du Fu, Bai Juyi, and Yuan Zhen, who participated in the development of this new style and the creation of various individual poems inspired by and inspirational to it. The patterns of new yuefu can be quite free or can take the form of five characters per line or the seven-character per line poems; however, the topics are often conventional. Similar to the ballad tradition of the earlier yuefu, many of the Tang yuefu are spoken in the voice of some persona, often that of a hunter, a peasant girl, or a soldier at the frontier. Similarly, the subjects and themes of the Tang yuefu vary from simply providing song lyrics, to engaging in social satire or criticism, literary exercise, lamentations at the departure of friends, attempts to visit not-to-be-found-hermits, and romantic love in relationship to singing &quot;girls&quot;, dancers or other professional entertainers, or the feelings of or for the ladies of the palace harems.

==Main compositions==

In the Han dynasty:
&quot;Mulberry By Road&quot; (陌上桑)， &quot;Armed Escort&quot; (羽林郎), &quot;White Hair Intonation&quot; (白头吟), &quot;Thinking is Being&quot; (有所思), &quot;The Old Soldier&#x27;s Return&quot; (十五从军征), &quot;The Peacocks Fly to the South and the East&quot; (孔雀东南飞),

In the Tang dynasty:
&quot;The Moon at the Fortified Pass (關山月/关山月/guānshān yuè) by Li Bai and the Songs of the Border (塞上曲/sàishàng qǔ) genre.

<text>The Jovians () and Herculians (Latin: &quot;Herculiani&quot;) were the senior palatine imperial guard units under the rule of Roman Emperor Diocletian (r. 284–305). They continued in existence thereafter as senior units in the field armies of the Western and Eastern Roman Empires.

==History==
The name originated in the equation of the two co-emperors Diocletian and Maximian with the Roman gods Jove and Hercules. The old-established Praetorian Guard was based at the &quot;Castra Praetoria&quot; in Rome, and had frequently proved disloyal, making and deposing emperors and even on one occasion in 193 putting the Imperial throne up for auction to the highest bidder (cf: Didius Julianus). 

Thus Diocletian, who ruled from Nicomedia, promoted two faithful legions from the Illyricum (Legio V &quot;Iovia&quot; and VI &quot;Herculia&quot;), the area he was also descended from, to be the personal protectors of the Roman Emperors. On their promotion, the two old legions were renamed &quot;Ioviani&quot; and &quot;Herculiani&quot;. The Praetorian Guard continued to exist until its abolishment by Constantine I in ca. 312, and replaced as the imperial guard by the &quot;Scholae Palatinae&quot;. The two legions however continued to be counted among the senior units of the army, and after its division between East and West, they too were divided.

In the late 4th century document &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot;, they are listed, for the West (bearing the title &quot;seniores&quot;), as directly under the command of the &quot;magister peditum&quot;, and for the East (the &quot;iuniores&quot;, junior to their counterparts in the West), as being under the command of the &quot;magister militum praesentalis&quot;. In 398, the Jovians and Herculians of the West were part of the small body that invaded Africa and suppressed the Gildonic revolt.

<doc id="671431" wikidata="Q1166044" url="?curid=671431" title="Ted Nugent (album)">
<text>Ted Nugent is the debut studio album by American rock musician Ted Nugent. The album was released in September 1975 by Epic Records. It was Nugent&#x27;s first release after the disbanding of his former group, The Amboy Dukes.

==Background==

Tired of The Amboy Dukes&#x27; lack of effort and discipline, Nugent decided he had enough and left the group. He took a three-month vacation (his first ever) clearing his head in the Colorado wilderness, spending his time deer hunting and enjoying the outdoors.
Renewed, Nugent returned to civilization in search of a new direction and a new band. Joining him in the Ted Nugent Band were former Amboy Duke Rob Grange on bass, along with Cliff Davies (ex-If) on drums and finally, from a local Michigan band called Scott which had opened for the Dukes previously, a singer/guitarist named Derek St. Holmes.

The new group hit the road and then the studio, forming the songs which would send their first album into the Billboard Top 30 and into the multi-platinum range. The first track, &quot;Stranglehold&quot;, would set the stage for Nugent&#x27;s career: an eight-minute plus guitar attack with vocals by St. Holmes and Nugent, a long solo played on Nugent&#x27;s Gibson Byrdland guitar recorded in one take and a unique phase bass guitar effect by Grange. St. Holmes&#x27; sang tracks such as &quot;Queen of the Forest&quot;, &quot;Hey Baby&quot;, &quot;Just What the Doctor Ordered&quot; and &quot;Snakeskin Cowboys&quot;, the latter featuring an 8-string Hagström bass played by Grange, which would prove to be staples of the band&#x27;s concert tours for years to come. &quot;Motor City Madhouse&quot; is an ode to Ted&#x27;s hometown of Detroit.

The album was produced by Tom Werman and former If manager Lew Futterman. Nugent said about the album, &quot;If anyone wanted to know what rock &#x27;n roll was all about, that&#x27;s the only album they&#x27;d need&quot;.

&quot;One had to recognize that there was a definite synergy between the band and Nugent&quot;, said producer Tom Werman.

==Reception==

In 2005, &quot;Ted Nugent&quot; was ranked number 487 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

&quot;Stranglehold&quot; has been ranked 31st greatest guitar solo of all time by &quot;Guitar World&quot;.

==Track listing==
All songs are credited as &quot;written and arranged by Ted Nugent&quot;, except &quot;Hey Baby&quot;, which is credited as &quot;written and arranged by Derek St. Holmes&quot;. In Martin Popoff&#x27;s book &quot;Epic Ted Nugent&quot;, Nugent admits that &quot;Stranglehold&quot; was co-written by Rob Grange, who never received a royalty share. Derek St. Holmes claims the album was co-written by the whole band, and that Nugent took sole credit as a way to not pay them royalties.

All songs have Derek St. Holmes on lead vocals, except where indicated.

<doc id="671433" wikidata="Q804572" url="?curid=671433" title="Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania">
<text>Bala Cynwyd ( ) is a community and census-designated place in Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania, United States. It is located on the Philadelphia Main Line in Southeastern Pennsylvania and borders the western edge of Philadelphia at U.S. Route 1 (City Avenue). The present-day community was originally two separate towns, Bala and Cynwyd, but was united as a singular community largely because the U.S. Post Office, the Bala Cynwyd branch, served both towns using ZIP Code 19004. The combining of the communities gives a total population of 9,285 as of the 2020 census. The community was long known as hyphenated Bala-Cynwyd. Bala and Cynwyd are currently served by separate stations on SEPTA&#x27;s Cynwyd Line of Regional Rail.

Bala Cynwyd lies in the Welsh Tract of Pennsylvania and was settled in the 1680s by Welsh Quakers, who named it after the town of Bala and the village of Cynwyd in Wales. A mixed residential community made up predominantly of single-family detached homes, it extends west of the Philadelphia city limits represented by City Avenue from Old Lancaster Road at 54th Street west to Meeting House Lane and then along Manayunk and Conshohocken State Roads north to Mary Watersford Road, then east along Belmont Avenue back to City. This large residential district contains some of Lower Merion&#x27;s oldest and finest stone mansions, built mainly from 1880 through the 1920s and located in the sycamore-lined district between Montgomery Avenue and Levering Mill Road, as well as split level tract houses built east of Manayunk Road just after World War II.

==History==
The oldest commercial district and the original center of Bala Cynwyd straddles the bridge over the old Pennsylvania Railroad tracks, originally belonging to the Columbia Railroad and now part of SEPTA&#x27;s Cynwyd Line, along Montgomery Avenue at Bala Avenue. This district, long on the National Register of Historic Places, was settled shortly after William Penn&#x27;s landing in Pennsylvania in 1682 and contains the village&#x27;s oldest commercial buildings, some dating to the earliest years of the 19th century. Bala Avenue is an extension of this original town center and comprises a specialized commercial district of its own more than a century old; it has long been known for its children&#x27;s clothing stores, women&#x27;s dress and consignment shops, the Bala Theater and a number of small restaurants. The remainder of Bala Cynwyd&#x27;s original commercial district extends south along Montgomery Avenue as part of the Bala Cynwyd-Merion Commercial District and is coextensive with the commercial center of Merion, with its popular delicatessens and restaurants.

The village is home to houses of worship of many religions. The oldest of these is Saint John&#x27;s Episcopal Church on Levering Mill Road, founded in 1863. Saint Matthias Catholic Church is also found one block south of Montgomery on Bryn Mawr Avenue. Bala Cynwyd has also drawn a number of Modern Orthodox and Conservative Jews who live within walking distance of Lower Merion Synagogue and Congregation Adath Israel on Old Lancaster Road where Bala Cynwyd meets Merion. Churches of other denominations are located in nearby Narberth, Wynnewood, Merion, and Wynnefield/Overbrook.

===20th century===
The Neighborhood Club of Bala Cynwyd, established in 1906, works to preserve the residential character of the neighborhood and promote civic welfare and community spirit. It sponsors an annual Independence Day celebration on July 4 which begins in front of the Union Fire Association on Montgomery Avenue and ends at the Bala Cynwyd Playground. The parade features neighborhood children riding decorated bicycles, marchers in costumes, clowns, floats, fire trucks, police, and public officials.

The Lower Merion Historical Society recently relocated its headquarters from Ashbridge House in Rosemont to the ancient Cynwyd Academy building, adjacent to Bala Cynwyd Middle School on Bryn Mawr Avenue in Cynwyd.

Among the claimants for First Boy Scout Troop in the United States is Troop 1 in Bala Cynwyd.

Bala Cynwyd has long been home to most of the broadcasting outlets in the Philadelphia region. In 1952, CBS television station WCAU-TV built its headquarters at the corner of City Avenue and Monument Road. Now an NBC owned-and-operated station, the station was located there until 2018, when the studios moved to the Comcast Technology Center in Center City Philadelphia, though some operations remain at the former studios. A decade later, ABC affiliate WFIL-TV moved to a new studio directly across the street from WCAU on City Avenue, just inside the Philadelphia city limits. The station, now ABC O&amp;O WPVI-TV, is still based there today. Bala Cynwyd is also home to Beasley Broadcast Group&#x27;s WBEN-FM, WMGK, WMMR and WPEN. iHeartMedia&#x27;s WDAS-FM, WDAS-AM, WUSL, WRFF, WUMR, and WIOQ radio stations are located on Presidential Boulevard; independently owned WBEB is located on City Avenue. CBS&#x27;s WGMP (now WPHT) left Bala Cynwyd to move to Philadelphia when NBC and CBS swapped stations in 1995, as did WTEL (formerly WIP) and WIP-FM (formerly WYSP). As of 2016, after some moves in and out of Philadelphia, CBS stations WXTU, WOGL, and WTDY are located in Bala. Bala Cynwyd is also the corporate home of Entercom Communications Corporation, which is poised to be the second largest owner of radio stations in the United States, following its announcement of a merger with CBS Radio February 2, 2017. 

Opened in 1957, Bala Cynwyd On City Avenue (formerly Bala Cynwyd Shopping Center) lies a half mile south of the village center, bordering Philadelphia on City Avenue. Its major outlets are Acme Markets, Olive Garden and LA Fitness; Saks Fifth Avenue is located a block to the east.

From 1946 to 1960, the National Football League had its headquarters located in Bala Cynwyd.

The Lower Merion Academy-Cynwyd Elementary School-Bala Cynwyd Junior High School Complex and West Laurel Hill Cemetery are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Schools ==

Bala Cynwyd is served by the Lower Merion School District, with its headquarters in Ardmore.

 school zoning is as follows: The vast majority of the CDP is zoned to Cynwyd Elementary School on Levering Mill Road, while some sections to the southwest are zoned to Merion Elementary School, and some small sections to the north are zoned to Belmont Hills Elementary School on Madison Avenue. Almost all of the CDP is zoned to Bala Cynwyd Middle School on North Bryn Mawr Avenue, while small portions to the north are zoned to Welsh Valley Middle School. In almost all of the CDP, high school students living in Bala Cynwyd may choose between Lower Merion High School in Ardmore and Harriton High School in Rosemont, while small portions to the north are zoned only to Harriton High School.

Another school in Bala Cynwyd is Kohelet Yeshiva High School on Old Lancaster Road. Located on Montgomery Avenue at Bryn Mawr Avenue is Kosloff Torah Academy, an Orthodox Jewish, private all-girls high school serving the local and general Philadelphia region. The private, Catholic Merion Mercy and Waldron Mercy Academies are only a quarter mile up Montgomery Avenue in Merion. The bilingual French International School of Philadelphia, on North Highland Avenue, teaches approximately 320 children from pre-kindergarten (K3) to eighth grade in French and English.

The Bala Cynwyd Public Library, part of the six-branch Lower Merion Library System, occupies a modern facility on Old Lancaster Road. It is home to more than 221,000 items and features up-to-date computer facilities and a dedicated children&#x27;s library on the second floor. The system as a whole, with its central library located at Bryn Mawr&#x27;s Ludington Memorial Library on South Bryn Mawr Avenue, is home to more than 1.4 million items and stands in the 99th percentile nationwide for annual resident visits and volumes per resident capita.

<text>Godfrey Lowell Cabot (February 26, 1861 – November 2, 1962) was an American industrialist who founded the Cabot Corporation.

==Early life==
Godfrey Lowell Cabot was born in Boston, Massachusetts and attended Boston Latin School. His father was Samuel Cabot III, an eminent surgeon, and his mother was Hannah Lowell Jackson Cabot. He had seven siblings: three being, Lilla Cabot (b. 1848), among the first American impressionist artists, Samuel Cabot IV (b. 1850), chemist and founder of Cabot Stains, and Arthur Tracy Cabot (born 1852), a progressive surgeon.

Cabot attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology for a year, before graduating from Harvard College with a SB in chemistry, in 1882. He was a famous aviation pioneer and World War I U.S. Navy pilot. He also founded the Aero Club of New England.

==Career==
Cabot founded Godfrey L. Cabot, Inc. and its successor, Cabot Corporation, in 1882. It became an industrial empire which included carbon black plants and tens of thousands of acres of land rich in gas, oil, and other minerals; of pipeline; seven corporations with worldwide operations; three facilities for converting natural gas into gasoline; and a number of research laboratories.

By 1890, Cabot Corporation, had become America&#x27;s fourth-largest producer of carbon black, which was used in products, such as inks, shoe polishes, and paints. But with the subsequent advent and popularity of cars, carbon black became in much greater demand as six pounds of it was required in the production of a single tire, and Cabot&#x27;s incomes soared.

===Philanthropic work===
Cabot was also a significant benefactor of MIT, primarily in solar research, resulting in important discoveries in photochemistry, thermal electricity, and in the construction of experimental solar houses. He also established the Godfrey L. Cabot Award for the advancement of aviation, Harvard&#x27;s Maria Moors Cabot Foundation for Botanical Research, the annual Maria Moors Cabot prize awarded by the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, as well as an endowed professorship at the institution. In 1973, Harvard&#x27;s Godfrey Lowell Cabot Science Library was named in his honor.

Cabot was associated with Calvin Coolidge from Coolidge&#x27;s Boston days. There is also an audio recording of a discussion between Cabot and Dwight D. Eisenhower on the influence of public opinion on government policy, communism, the Soviet Union, aviation, and V-2 rockets in 1950, kept by the Miller Center of Public Affairs.
While in his nineties, Cabot sponsored the restoration of the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology&#x27;s (MCZ) complete Kronosaurus skeleton. Having been interested in sea serpents since childhood and thus often questioning MCZ director Alfred Romer about the existence and reports of sea serpents, it thus occurred to Dr. Romer to tell Mr. Cabot about the unexcavated Kronosaurus skeleton in the museum closet. Godfrey Cabot thus asked how much a restoration would cost and &quot;Romer, pulling a figure out of the musty air, replied, &#x27;Oh, about $10,000.&#x27;&quot; Romer may not have been serious but the philanthropist clearly was because the check for said sum came shortly thereafter. To this day, the application to the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences asks applicants, &quot;Are you an employee of Godfrey L. Cabot, Inc. or any associated companies?&quot;

==Watch and Ward Society==
Cabot also devoted his resources to the controversial activist organization known as the New England Society for the Suppression of Vice in Boston. Before Cabot&#x27;s involvement, the society had made its mark by helping instigate obscenity charges against Walt Whitman&#x27;s Leaves of Grass. Under Cabot&#x27;s direction, the organization renamed Watch and Ward Society used economic, social, and legal pressures and even harassment techniques to block the sale and distribution of books which they disapproved of for moral reasons. Among the writers to which they objected were Conrad Aiken, Sherwood Anderson, John Dos Passos, Theodore Dreiser, William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, Aldous Huxley, James Joyce, Sinclair Lewis, Bertrand Russell, Upton Sinclair, and H. G. Wells.

While president, he wiretapped the office of district attorney Joseph C. Pelletier. Cabot justified the recording device by saying he needed incriminating evidence to remove Pelletier from office. The Society had also hired a private detective to keep the district attorney under surveillance for two years. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court found Pelletier guilty of 10 of the 21 charges against him and removed him from office.

==Personal life==
On June 23, 1890, Cabot married Maria B. Moors. They had five children:

* James Jackson Cabot (b. 1891)
* Thomas Dudley Cabot (1897–1995), a businessman and philanthropist in his own right.
* John Moors Cabot (1901–1981), U.S. Ambassador to Sweden, Colombia, Brazil, and Poland during the Eisenhower and Kennedy administration,
* Eleanor Cabot of the Eleanor Cabot Bradley Estate
* William Putnam Cabot.

<doc id="671436" wikidata="Q189624" url="?curid=671436" title="List of World Heritage Sites in Africa">
<text>The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has designated 147 World Heritage Sites in Africa. These sites are located in 46 countries (also called &quot;state parties&quot;).

== Selection of World Heritage Sites ==
Ethiopia has the lead with eleven sites; followed by South Africa with ten, Morocco and Tunisia being home to nine sites; then Algeria, Egypt, Senegal, and Tanzania at seven. Nine countries have only a single site each. Four sites are shared between two countries: Maloti-Drakensberg Park (Lesotho and South Africa), the Mount Nimba Strict Nature Reserve (Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and Guinea), the Stone Circles of Senegambia (the Gambia and Senegal), and Mosi-oa-Tunya / Victoria Falls (Zambia and Zimbabwe). Two sites are shared among three countries: Sangha Trinational (Central African Republic, Cameroon, and Congo) and W-Arly-Penjari Complex (Benin, Burkina Faso, and Niger).

The first sites from the continent were inscribed in 1978, when the Island of Gorée of Senegal and the Rock-Hewn Churches and Simien National Park of Ethiopia were chosen during the list&#x27;s conception.

As of September 2017, Somalia has no official World Heritage Sites since the Somali government is not party to the 1972 World Heritage Convention. However, there are—at the very least—around a dozen archaeological sites in the country that are believed to be potential future candidates for World Heritage status.

Each year, UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage Committee may inscribe new sites on the list or delist sites that no longer meet the criteria. Selection is based on ten criteria: six for cultural heritage (i–vi) and four for natural heritage (vii–x). Some sites, designated &quot;mixed sites&quot;, represent both cultural and natural heritage. In Africa, there are 91 cultural, 50 natural, and 6 mixed sites.

Several efforts have been devoted to increasing the number of sites and preserving the heritage of existing sites on the continent; for example, on 5 May 2006, the African World Heritage Fund was launched by UNESCO to target the region of Sub-Saharan Africa. It planned to protect the sites by hiring personnel for state parties to maintain national inventories of existing sites, as well as to &quot;prepare nomination dossiers for inscription onto the World Heritage List&quot;. Grants were also destined to help the &quot;[conservation] and management of heritage properties in general&quot; and to rehabilitate properties in danger.

The drive was initially funded by South Africa with US$3.5 million, and, as of March 2011, has amassed $4.7 million from various countries, with an additional $4.1 million in pending pledges. UNESCO has also attempted to increase awareness of African human origin sites in Ethiopia, with a goal of conserving and protecting the areas from further deterioration.

The World Heritage Committee may also specify that a site is endangered, citing &quot;conditions which threaten the very characteristics for which a property was inscribed on the World Heritage List&quot;. Along with other World Heritage Sites, sites in danger are subject to re-evaluation by the committee every year at their &quot;ordinary sessions&quot;. Africa has 21 sites on the danger list, accounting for 14% of all African sites and 40% of the 52 endangered sites worldwide. Libya has 5 sites on the danger list, the second-highest of any country in the world.

Sites in Africa have been marked as such for a variety of reasons, such as deforestation and hunting, civil war, threats to and hostage taking of reserve staff, oil and gas projects and mining, declines in biodiversity, and structural damage to buildings. Ten sites were formerly declared as being in danger, but have since lost the status; examples include the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (1984–1989), the Rwenzori Mountains National Park (1999–2004), and Tipasa (2002–2006). Garamba National Park and Timbuktu have also lost their statuses in 1992 and 2005, respectively, but later regained it in 1996 and 2012. Despite its large number of endangered sites and the circumstances surrounding them, African World Heritage Sites have never been stripped of their title, something that has only occurred three times.

== World Heritage Sites ==
=== Legend ===
The list below ignores UNESCO&#x27;s geopolitical definition of Africa and includes what it describes as sites in the &quot;Arab States&quot;. Egypt is included as part of North Africa. The list also comprises a number of sites for which the state party is outside the continent, but the site itself is located in Africa; four such sites are located on the Canary Islands (belonging to Spain), one on Madeira (belonging to Portugal), one on Réunion (belonging to France), and one on the Tristan da Cunha archipelago (belonging to the United Kingdom).

:Site – named after the World Heritage Committee&#x27;s official designation
:Location – sorted by country, followed by the region at the regional or provincial level. In the case of multinational or multi-regional sites, the names are sorted alphabetically.
:Criteria – as defined by the World Heritage Committee
:Area – in hectares and acres, excluding any buffer zones. A value of &quot;—&quot; implies that no data has been published by UNESCO
:Year – during which the site was inscribed to the World Heritage List
:Description – brief information about the site, including reasons for qualifying as an endangered site, if applicable

=== Sites ===
== Performance of Africa in UNESCO ==
The countries are divided according to their regions: blue for Northern Africa, orange for Eastern Africa, purple for Central Africa, green for Western Africa, and red for Southern Africa. (Note: this chart does not include the sites located in Africa that belong to European countries.)

<doc id="671440" wikidata="Q918982" url="?curid=671440" title="British Columbia Highway 3A">
<text>Highway 3A is the designation of two segments of highway in the southern part of British Columbia.

==Castlegar-Nelson-Creston Highway==

This was the first segment of highway in British Columbia to receive the &#x27;3A&#x27; designation. It acquired this designation when the Crowsnest Highway was routed into the Kootenay Pass area in 1964. Originally, a ferry was used to route Highway 3A over the Columbia River near Castlegar, which was replaced by a bridge in 1967.

The long Kootenay section of Highway 3A begins at Castlegar, where it leaves Highway 3 and travels northeast to South Slocan, where Highway 6 merges onto Highway 3A. The two highways proceed east for to Nelson, where Highway 6 diverges south. northeast of Nelson, Highway 3A reaches Balfour, on the western shore of Kootenay Lake. A ferry takes Highway 3A across Kootenay Lake to Kootenay Bay. Highway 3A then follows the eastern shore of Kootenay Lake for south through Crawford Bay, Boswell, and Wynndel to Creston, where it rejoins Highway 3.

The 3A marker in Creston at the junction with the Kootenay pass route falsely advertises it as a northbound highway rather than a westbound highway although all other 3A markers properly describe it as west and eastbound just as the 3 main.

The Kootenay pass is prone to closures especially during avalanche season and when it is closed Highway 3A and the Kootenay Lake ferry once again becomes a vital link for all traffic on the Crowsnest highway which would otherwise completely cease to function. The ferry will operate on a 24h basis until the pass re opens.

Even when the pass is open and despite the pass route being shorter some Kootenay locals still personally prefer to drive the Kootenay Lake route rather than the Salmo Creston route viewing the ferry route as a safer option especially if the weather is bad or at risk of turning bad or if there are construction delays on the pass. It&#x27;s possible for example for the entirety of 3A from Creston to Castlegar to be bare and dry while the pass is still covered in snow and ice. 3A is also a far easier bicycle route than the Kootenay pass. This combined with people who simply wish to experience a more relaxed drive means a significant minority of ferry users in a given week are using the ferry as part of a trip all the way to or from the coast just as it was used for before the pass route was built.

===Major intersections===




==Keremeos-Kaleden Junction Highway==
A new section of highway through the Richter Pass from Keremeos to Osoyoos was opened in 1965. The 2-lane Crowsnest Highway was re-routed through this area in 1967, and the segment between Keremeos and Osoyoos was given the Highway 3 Southern Trans-Canada designation. This long segment of Highway 3 runs south from Keremeos, past the turnoff to Nighthawk, USA, then east over Richter Pass to Osoyoos. It&#x27;s a main part of the bike course for the Subaru Ironman held each August in the Okanagan-Similkameen. The event was known as Challenge Penticton Triathlon between 2013 and 2019 when Subaru withdrew its sponsorship and moved the event to Whistler. The event was reinstated to Penticton beginning in 2022.

Highway 3A runs from Keremeos north through Olalla and up the long hill to Yellow Lake, then east past Twin Lakes and through the Marron Valley to Kaleden Junction where it intersects with Highway 97, the North-South Okanagan route, south of Penticton. Highway 3A used to continue south along Highway 97, past Okanagan Falls and Oliver to Osoyoos, but the Highway 3A/97 concurrency has since been decommissioned. Signage at Kaleden junction and in Okanagan falls remains and a new 3A sign was installed as part of the reworking of the junction. The &quot;Yellow Lake route&quot; from Keremeos to Osoyoos is still considered a core part of highway 3 if the Richter highway closes and the route has seen renewed importance with the washouts and the Osoyoos wildfire leading to increased essential travel along what was long considered an obsolete legacy route used mostly by local traffic.

Extra driving time should be allowed for traffic congestion (tourism) in the Okanagan in summer. There is also some agricultural traffic in both valleys. There is limited 3 and 4 laning.

===Major intersections===


==Richter Pass Highway==
For a time between 1965 and about 1967, the section of what is now Highway 3 was designated as Highway 3A 
The highway through Richter Pass itself opened on July 7, 1965

<doc id="671443" wikidata="Q559736" url="?curid=671443" title="Xu Chu">
<text>Xu Chu () (died 230), courtesy name Zhongkang, was a Chinese military general who lived during the late Eastern Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period of China. He started his career as a bodyguard to the warlord Cao Cao and later became a general in the state of Wei during the Three Kingdoms period. He was described to be a big and strong man, yet simple minded and honest, so he was nicknamed &quot;Tiger Fool&quot; by his men. After his death, he was posthumously honoured with the title &quot;Marquis Zhuang&quot;, which literally means &quot;robust marquis&quot;.

==Early life==
Xu Chu was from Qiao County (), Pei State (), which is present-day Bozhou, Anhui. He was over eight &quot;chi&quot; tall (≈1.86 metres) with a broad waist. He had an imposing and sturdy look and was known for his great strength and courage.

Towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty, Xu Chu rallied thousands of his clan members and they constructed a fortress to fend off the Yellow Turban rebels. An army of rebels from Runan (汝南; present-day Runan County, Henan), numbering more than 10,000, once attacked Xu Chu&#x27;s fortress. The defenders were outnumbered and worn out as the battle dragged on. When the arrows were used up, Xu Chu told all the men and women within the fortress to gather stones the size of chess pieces and place them in the four corners of the fortress. He then hurled the stones at the enemies, crushing the bones of all those who were hit. The rebels then kept a distance away and did not dare to come close. When the food supply was exhausted, Xu Chu pretended to negotiate a truce with the rebels and discuss a deal to exchange an ox for food. When the rebels came to collect the ox, the animal would always run back. Xu Chu, holding on to the ox&#x27;s tail, pulled it along for more than a hundred steps. Seeing this, the startled rebels took off without the ox. The rebels in the surrounding areas heard of this incident and became fearful of Xu Chu.

==Service under Cao Cao==
In 197, when Cao Cao came to the Runan and Huainan area, Xu Chu led his militia to join the warlord. Upon seeing Xu Chu&#x27;s strength, Cao Cao exclaimed: &quot;This man is my Fan Kuai!&quot; Xu Chu was appointed as a Commandant () among Cao Cao&#x27;s close guards, who were known as the &quot;Tiger Warriors&quot; (). During Cao Cao&#x27;s campaign against a rival warlord Zhang Xiu, Xu Chu fought on the frontline and slew many enemies. He was promoted to Colonel () for his achievement.

In 200, Xu Chu followed Cao Cao to the Battle of Guandu against the northern warlord Yuan Shao. During the battle, Xu Ta () and some conspirators plotted to assassinate Cao Cao. They feared Xu Chu so they waited until he went to rest before they entered Cao Cao&#x27;s tent with swords hidden under their clothes. Xu Chu felt uneasy earlier on, so he had returned to Cao Cao&#x27;s tent to protect his lord. When Xu Ta and the others showed up in Cao Cao&#x27;s tent, they were very surprised to see Xu Chu there and could not contain their astonishment. Xu Chu sensed their intentions and killed them. After this incident, Cao Cao trusted Xu Chu even more and would go nowhere without Xu Chu by his side. Xu Chu participated in the Battle of Ye in 204 and received the title of a Secondary Marquis () as a reward for his efforts.

===Battle of Tong Pass===
In 211, during the Battle of Tong Pass against a coalition of northwestern warlords led by Ma Chao and Han Sui, Cao Cao led his troops north across the Wei River in an attempt to circle to the rear of the enemy. The bulk of Cao Cao&#x27;s troops had already crossed the river, leaving Cao Cao and his &quot;Tiger Warriors&quot; to bring up the rear. Just then, Ma Chao and his 10,000 horsemen caught up with them. As the enemies were approaching fast, Cao Cao&#x27;s soldiers rushed to get on board the ferry, which was on the verge of sinking under the weight. Xu Chu held up a saddle with his left hand to shield Cao Cao from arrows and carried a sword in his right hand, using it to slash enemy soldiers trying to clamber onto the vessel. By then, the boatman had been killed by arrows, so Xu Chu, still holding up the saddle with his left hand, used his other hand to grab a bargepole and push the ferry away from the ford to safety.

Cao Cao later agreed to meet Ma Chao and Han Sui for talks, and he brought along only Xu Chu. Ma Chao had confidence in himself and he secretly planned to use the opportunity to charge forward and capture Cao Cao, but he had heard of Xu Chu&#x27;s might before and he suspected that the man beside Cao Cao was Xu Chu. Ma Chao asked Cao Cao: &quot;Where&#x27;s your Tiger Marquis?&quot; Cao Cao pointed at Xu Chu, who glared at Ma Chao. Ma Chao was afraid and did not dare to make his move. Both sides then returned to their respective camps. Several days later, a battle was fought, and Cao Cao scored a major victory. Xu Chu killed several enemies and was promoted to Military Guard General of the Household () for his achievement. This was the first time the term &quot;Military Guard&quot; () was used. Cao Cao&#x27;s soldiers knew that Xu Chu possessed the might of a tiger, but he was also simple minded, so they nicknamed him &quot;Tiger Fool&quot; ().

===Incident with Cao Ren===
Xu Chu was known to be a cautious and serious person who did not talk much and was very mindful of rules and regulations. Once, Cao Cao&#x27;s cousin Cao Ren came from Jing Province to meet Cao Cao, who had recently been enfeoffed as a vassal king. Cao Cao was still in his personal chambers, with Xu Chu standing guard outside, when Cao Ren arrived. Cao Ren asked Xu Chu to join him in the side room for a chat. However, Xu Chu told Cao Ren that Cao Cao was coming out soon, and then turned his back on Cao Ren and entered Cao Cao&#x27;s chambers. Cao Ren was very unhappy with Xu Chu for treating him coldly. Later, someone told Xu Chu: &quot;The General (Cao Ren) is a close relative and important subject of the King. He lowered himself when he asked to chat with you. How could you reject him?&quot; Xu Chu replied: &quot;He may be a close relative and important subject of the King, but he&#x27;s in charge of external defences at the borders. I, Xu Chu, am in charge of internal security. If he wanted to chat with me, we could do so in public. Why did he ask to chat with me in private?&quot; Cao Cao was impressed and he favoured Xu Chu even more after he heard about the incident, so he promoted him to Central Resolute General ().

==Service under Cao Pi==
When Cao Cao died in March 220, Xu Chu was so overwhelmed with sorrow that he vomited blood. Later that year, Cao Cao&#x27;s son Cao Pi ended the Eastern Han dynasty and established the state of Wei, marking the start of the Three Kingdoms period. Cao Pi became emperor and he also favoured Xu Chu greatly. He promoted Xu Chu to General of the Military Guards (), put him in charge of the palace guards and enfeoffed him as the Marquis of Wansui Village (). The original &quot;Tiger Warriors&quot; under Xu Chu&#x27;s command were all commissioned as officers, but only slightly more than 10 of them rose through the ranks to become generals and marquises, while only about a hundred were promoted to commandants and colonels.

Cao Pi died in June 226 and was succeeded by his son Cao Rui. Cao Rui enfeoffed Xu Chu as the Marquis of Mou District () and granted him a marquisate comprising 700 taxable households. He also awarded the peerage of a Secondary Marquis () to one of Xu Chu&#x27;s sons. After his death, Xu Chu was given the posthumous name &quot;Marquis Zhuang&quot; (), which literally means &quot;robust marquis&quot;.

==Family and descendants==
Sometime during the Taihe era (227-233) of Cao Rui&#x27;s reign, the emperor issued an imperial edict praising Xu Chu and conferring the peerage of a Secondary Marquis () on one of Xu Chu&#x27;s sons and one of his grandsons.

Xu Chu&#x27;s son, Xu Yi (), inherited his father&#x27;s peerage. In 263, when the Wei state launched a major campaign to conquer its rival state Shu, Xu Yi served as an officer under the Wei general Zhong Hui, who tasked him with overseeing the construction of a road leading into Shu. However, when the road turned out to be poorly built, Zhong Hui disregarded Xu Yi&#x27;s background and had him executed for failing his mission. The Wei army was shocked at Zhong Hui&#x27;s audacity. Xu Yi&#x27;s son, Xu Zong (), inherited his father&#x27;s peerage at the beginning of the &quot;Taishi&quot; era (February 266 to 274) of the reign of Jin-dynasty emperor Emperor Wu.

Xu Chu&#x27;s elder brother, Xu Ding (), also served in the Wei military and was promoted to General Who Inspires Might () and commanded the &quot;huben&quot; division of the imperial guards.

==Appraisal==
Chen Shou, who wrote Xu Chu&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, commented that Xu Chu and Dian Wei were powerful bodyguards and were comparable to Fan Kuai, a general who served under Liu Bang, the founding emperor of the Han dynasty.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==

Xu Chu appears as a character in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, which romanticises the historical events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. His bravery and strength are emphasised by a fictitious story in Chapter 59, when he duels with Ma Chao during the Battle of Tong Pass.

==In popular culture==
Xu Chu is featured as a playable character in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; and &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot; video game series. His name is erroneously romanised as &quot;Xu Zhu&quot; in the games.

Xu Chu is featured as a guardian spirit alongside &quot;Dian Wei&quot; of General Cao Yanbing in the anime &quot;Rakshasa Street&quot;.

<doc id="671455" wikidata="Q248354" url="?curid=671455" title="Infernal Affairs III">
<text>Infernal Affairs III is a 2003 Hong Kong crime action film directed by Andrew Lau and Alan Mak. It is the third and final installment in the &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; film series, and is both a sequel and a semi-prequel to the original film, as it intercuts events before and after the events in the first film. Andy Lau, Tony Leung, Kelly Chen, Anthony Wong, Eric Tsang, and Chapman To reprise their roles again, joined by new cast members Leon Lai and Chen Daoming.

&quot;Infernal Affairs III&quot; received mixed to positive reviews, grossed $4.5 million and was nominated for seven Hong Kong Film Awards.

There are two cuts of the film, both available on DVD: a 107-minute version which was released in Hong Kong theatres, and a 118-minute version, which is the directors&#x27; cut.

==Plot==
&quot;Infernal Affairs III&quot; uses parallel storytelling, flashing between the past and the present.

===Six months before Chan&#x27;s death===

Undercover Hong Kong Police Force officer Chan Wing-Yan seeks to uncover the link between Hong Kong Triad boss Hon Sam and the mysterious Mainland Chinese gang leader Shen Cheng. Since Hon&#x27;s ascension to the seat of triad boss was due to the death of his predecessor, Ngai Wing-Hau, Hon is suspicious of all his men for fear they might usurp his position. He tests Chan&#x27;s loyalty by ordering him to smash an ashtray on Shen&#x27;s brother during a negotiation, resulting in Chan&#x27;s arrest by Inspector Yeung Kam-Wing. Yeung tells Chan that though Chan does not recognise him, he recognises Chan and he warns the latter to &quot;be careful&quot;. Chan is released after both Hon and Shen fetch him at police headquarters.

Concurrently, Chan is prosecuted for violent behaviour. His superior, Superintendent Wong Chi-shing, persuades the court to allow Chan to seek therapy, leading him to meet therapist Lee Sum-Yee. Hon asks Chan to deliver arms to Shen, but he and other triad members do not show up. When Chan delivers the cargo, Shen&#x27;s men discover that the boxes are empty and open fire on Chan; Shen and Chan shoot each other in the limbs during the crossfire. Shen finds out that Chan is an undercover cop when Yeung unexpectedly arrives on the scene. Yeung tells Chan that Shen is also an undercover cop working for the Mainland authorities. Yeung also tells Chan that he gained top honours when he was in the police academy due to Chan&#x27;s &quot;expulsion&quot;. The three shake hands, wait for the chaos to subside, then leave.

===Ten months after Chan&#x27;s death===
Senior Inspector Lau Kin-Ming, Hon&#x27;s ex-spy in the Hong Kong Police Force, has been demoted to administrative duty pending an investigation into the deaths of Chan and Inspector B. He falsely claims that B shot Chan in the head while holding him hostage, and that he killed B in retaliation. After months of investigation, Lau is reinstated back to Internal Affairs, where he struggles to conceal his criminal past and protect his true identity. Lau later learns that Hon had previously planted five other spies in the police force, one of whom might be a fellow Security Division Inspector, Yeung. A battle of wits develops between Lau and Yeung, as each of them tries to discover the other&#x27;s secret.

Meanwhile, Lau suffers from an identity collapse as he loses track of reality, wrestling with guilt over Chan&#x27;s death and grappling with his impending divorce from his wife, Mary. His psychological trauma deteriorates to the point where he begins to see himself as Chan. As &quot;Chan&quot;, Lau makes it a personal mission to apprehend Yeung, whom he sees as his former self. After witnessing an incident where Lau suffers a hallucination, Lee conducts a hypnosis on him and finds out that he was Hon&#x27;s spy. Lau realises his folly and knocks Lee unconscious before escaping.

Lau steals tapes from Yeung&#x27;s office safe, using spy cameras to determine the code. He thinks he hears recordings of Yeung relating information to Hon, and leads his Internal Affairs team to the Security Division to arrest Yeung just as Shen arrives. Lau plays a tape recording, which is actually a conversation between him and Hon. When Lau&#x27;s second-in-command tries to arrest him instead, Lau panics and draws his gun, killing Yeung. He is immediately shot by Shen and attempts suicide by shooting himself in the neck. During a search of Lau&#x27;s office, a tape is found in his safe and played. It is a recording of the song sung by Tsai Chin, given to him by Hon&#x27;s wife.

===Eleven months after Chan&#x27;s death===
A series of flashbacks play: immediately after Chan&#x27;s death, Shen and Yeung meet. Shen suspects Lau. Yeung breaks into Lau&#x27;s office to find tape recordings of his conversations with Hon, proving that Shen is right.

Yeung is buried next to Chan in the police cemetery. Shen and Lee visit the graves and Shen says to Lee: &quot;Events change men, but men do not change events. But these two men are extraordinary because they changed events.&quot;

Lau ends up crippled and catatonic, lost inside his own mind, haunted by the spirit of Mary (Hon Sam&#x27;s wife, whom he had a crush on in &quot;Infernal Affairs II&quot;) and locked in his own &quot;continuous hell&quot;. His divorced wife Mary visits and tells him, &quot;Our baby can say &quot;papa&quot; now.&quot; Before the picture fades into the next scene, the camera pans down onto Lau&#x27;s fingers tapping out in Morse code, &quot;H-E-L...&quot; (and then the start of another &#x27;L&#x27; as the picture dims).

Before the film ends, there is one final flashback to the hi-fi shop scene in &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot;, where Lau is buying an audio system from Chan.

==Music==

==Reception==
Despite grossing higher than the second film at the Hong Kong box office with HK$30,225,661 (over HK$5 million more than &quot;Infernal Affairs II&quot;), &quot;Infernal Affairs III&quot; is less critically successful than the former.

In his review of the film, Ed Gonzalez from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; described it as a &quot;jumpy, unnecessary sequel&quot;. He writes, &quot;As overstuffed as the second film and as melodramatic as the first, it lacks the grace of the former and the whiz-bang poetry of the first film’s better sequences. Like &quot;The Godfather III&quot;, it seemingly exists to buff its predecessors’ rough spots but only tarnishes their memories.&quot;

Derek Elley from &quot;Variety&quot; noted its use of &quot;copious flashbacks&quot; and its rushed ending, writing that &quot;there’s a growing sense of the writers thrashing around to provide a finale. This finally comes, though in bits and pieces, capped by an endless series of datelines (“seven months later,” etc.) that’s borderline self-parody.&quot; He expressed that the film &quot;is best experienced as a free riff on the previous two movies, not as a grand climax to the trilogy,&quot; and that the technical aspects &quot;are at their smoothest, though far from the striking originality of the first movie.&quot;

Manfred Selzer from &quot;AsianMovieWeb&quot; gave the film a rating of 7 out of 8, praising it for delivering &quot;a big deal of thrill, tension and has a great story to hold everything together, which makes the third part, too, a movie experience,&quot; although he felt that &quot;the finale feels a bit like a neverending epilogue, which didn&#x27;t know where to find an end.&quot;

Ross Chen from &quot;LoveHKFilm&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Infernal Affairs III&quot; is not tightly crafted like the first film, nor meaty and dramatic like the second.&quot; Despite being surprised by its creative narrative, he found &quot;more than a few massive plot holes which simply do not hold up on closer inspection.&quot; He also writes that the star-studded cast &quot;is one of the things that makes it enjoyable, if not too egregiously commercial.&quot;

<text>The North American F-82 Twin Mustang is an American long-range escort fighter. Based on the North American P-51 Mustang, the F-82 was designed as an escort for the Boeing B-29 Superfortress in World War II, but the war ended well before the first production units were operational. The F-82 was the last American piston-engined fighter ordered into production by the United States Air Force. 

In the postwar era, Strategic Air Command used the aircraft as a long-range escort fighter. Radar-equipped F-82s were used extensively by the Air Defense Command as replacements for the Northrop P-61 Black Widow as all-weather day/night interceptors. During the Korean War, Japan-based F-82s were among the first USAF aircraft to operate over Korea. The first three North Korean aircraft destroyed by U.S. forces were shot down by F-82s, the first being a North Korean Yak-11 downed over Gimpo Airfield by the USAF 68th Fighter Squadron.

==Design and development==
Initially intended as a very long-range (VLR) escort fighter, the F-82 was designed to escort Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers on missions exceeding from the Solomon Islands or Philippines to Tokyo, missions beyond the range of the Lockheed P-38 Lightning and conventional P-51 Mustangs. Such missions were part of the planned U.S. invasion of the Japanese home islands, which was forestalled by the surrender of Japan after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the opening of Soviet attacks on Japanese-held territory in Manchuria.


Development of the Twin Mustang began in October 1943. Two new-design fuselages based on the XP-51F were lengthened by a fuselage plug inserted behind the cockpit and joined by a center wing section mounting six .50 caliber (12.7mm) M3 Browning machine guns. The prototype XP-82 carried an eight-gun pod beneath the center wing, but this was not included as an option for the production aircraft. A different gun pod, fitted with a cannon, was also proposed. The outer wings were fitted with four hardpoints rated for up to of ordnance each. The landing gear was of conventional type; the main wheels retracted into the fuselage center sections. Power was provided by two Packard-built Rolls-Royce V-1650 Merlin engines. 

The XP-82 prototypes, and production P-82Bs and P-82Es, retained both fully equipped cockpits so that pilots could fly the aircraft from either position, alternating control on long flights, while later night fighter versions kept the cockpit on the left side only, placing the radar operator in the right position.

The first flight of the prototype took place in June 26, 1945; a production order for P-82B Twin Mustangs had been placed in March 1945. Although some P-82B airframes were completed before the end of World War II, most remained at the North American factory in California waiting for engines until 1946. As a result, none saw service during the war.

Like most versions of the P-51 Mustang, the first two prototype XP-82s as well as the next 20 P-82B models were powered by British-designed Rolls-Royce Merlin engines, re-engineered for increased durability and mass-production, and built under license by Packard. These provided the fighter with excellent range and performance; however, the Army had always wanted to give the Twin Mustang a purely American and stronger engine than the foreign-designed P-51&#x27;s V-1650 (built at Packard plants, dismantled after the war). In addition, the licensing fees paid to Rolls-Royce for each V-1650 were being increased by Britain after the war. It therefore negotiated in August 1945 with the Allison Division of the General Motors Corporation for a new version of the Allison V-1710-100 engine. This forced North American to switch subsequent production P-82C and later models to the lower-powered engines. It was found that Allison-powered P-82 models demonstrated a lower top speed and poorer high-altitude performance than the earlier Merlin-powered versions. The earlier P-82B models were designated as trainers, while the &quot;C&quot; and later models were employed as fighters, making the P-82 one of the few aircraft in U.S. military history to be faster in its trainer version than the fighter version.

In 1948, the 3200th Proof Test Group at Eglin AFB, Florida, fitted the 4th F-82B Twin Mustang with retractable pylons under the outer wings capable of mounting 10 High-Velocity Air Rockets (HVAR) each, which folded into the wing undersurface when not in use. This installation was not adopted on later models, the standard &quot;tree&quot; being used instead. The 13th aircraft was experimentally fitted with a center wing mounted pod housing an array of recon cameras, and was assigned to the 3200th Photo Test Squadron, being designated, unofficially, the RF-82B.

===Record-setting===
On 27 February 1947, P-82B, named &quot;Betty Jo&quot; and flown by Colonel Robert E. Thacker, made history when it flew nonstop from Hawaii to New York without refueling, a distance of in 14 hr 32 min. It averaged . This flight tested the P-82&#x27;s range. The aircraft carried a full internal fuel tank of , augmented by four tanks for a total of . Colonel Thacker did not drop three external tanks when their fuel was expended, either because of an oversight, or because they were stuck due to a mechanical glitch. This remains the longest nonstop flight ever made by a propeller-driven fighter, and the fastest time in which such a distance has ever been covered in a piston-engine aircraft. The aircraft chosen was an earlier &quot;B&quot; model powered by Rolls-Royce Merlin engines (see &quot;Surviving aircraft&quot; below).

==Operational history==
The Twin Mustang was developed at the end of the prop-driven fighter era and at the dawn of the jet age. Its designed role as a long-range fighter escort was eliminated by the end of World War II. With the rapid draw-down of the armed forces after the war, the newly established United States Air Force had little money for new prop-driven aircraft, especially since jets, such as the Messerschmitt Me 262, had been faster than P-51 Mustangs in the skies of Germany in late 1944. The completed airframes (minus engines) of the P-82 pre-production aircraft already manufactured went into storage, with an uncertain future.

However, during the 1947 Soviet Aviation Day display at Tushino Airport, a surprise appearance was put in by what looked like three Boeing B-29s, followed by a fourth, passenger version, the Tu-70. The first three were examples of the Tupolev Tu-4, which was a reverse-engineered B-29 Superfortress, three examples of which were known to have been interned in the Soviet Union after having been forced to land there during bombing raids against Japan in WWII. Since the USSR was expected to have nuclear weapons sooner or later, the appearance of the Soviet Tu-4 was a shock to U.S. military planners, since it meant that the U.S. mainland might be vulnerable to a Soviet nuclear attack from the air.

Until jet interceptors could be developed and put into service, the Twin Mustangs already built were seen as an interim solution to SAC&#x27;s fighter escort mission for its strategic bomber force and also as an all-weather air defense interceptor.

Early attempts to develop jet-powered all-weather fighters ran into a series of delays. The Curtiss-Wright XF-87 Blackhawk was ordered in December 1945, but it ran into development difficulties and the project was abandoned in October 1948. The Northrop P-89 Scorpion had greater promise, but it too had teething troubles and was not expected to enter service until 1952 at the earliest. Due to the lack of a suitable jet-powered replacement, the wartime Northrop P-61 Black Widow night fighter was forced into this role, and in order to fill in the gap until the Scorpion became available, night fighter adaptations of the Twin Mustang were developed and deployed.

On 11 June 1948, the newly formed United States Air Force replaced the P-for-pursuit category with F-for-fighter. All P-82s were then re-designated F-82.

===Strategic Air Command===
The F-82E was the first operational model and its initial operational assignment was to the Strategic Air Command 27th Fighter (later Fighter-Escort) Wing at Kearney Air Force Base, Nebraska in March 1948.

During World War II, the P-51 Mustang had escorted Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers from bases in England and Southern Italy to targets in Nazi-occupied Europe. However, the Cold War brought on the challenge of B-29, Boeing B-50 or Convair B-36 missions into the Soviet Union. The size of the Soviet Union dictated long bombing missions there and back from bases in Europe or Alaska, most of it over Soviet territory. Also the weather, which was bad enough in Western Europe, would make bombing missions exceptionally difficult between October and May. With no long-range jet fighters to escort the strategic bomber force, the 27th FEW was to fly these missions in F-82Es.

The F-82E had a range of over , which meant that with external fuel tanks it could fly from London to Moscow, loiter for 30 minutes over the target, and return, the only American fighter which could do so. It also had an operational ceiling of , where it could stay close to the bombers it was designed to protect. The first production F-82Es reached the 27th in early 1948, and almost immediately the group was deployed to McChord AFB, Washington, in June, where its squadrons stood on alert on a secondary air defense mission due to heightened tensions over the Berlin Airlift. It was also believed that the 27th would launch an escort mission, presumably to the Soviet Union, if conflict broke out in Europe. From McChord, the group flew its Twin Mustangs on weather reconnaissance missions over the northwest Pacific, but problems were encountered with their fuel tanks. Decommissioned F-61 Black Widow external tanks were found at Hamilton AFB, California, which could be modified for the F-82; fitted on the pylons of the Twin Mustang, these solved the problem. With a reduction in tension, the 27th returned to its home base in Nebraska during September.

Four F-82s were deployed from McChord to Alaska, where the pilots provided transition training to the 449th Fighter (All Weather) Squadron, which used Twin Mustangs in the air defense mission. They remained in Alaska for about 45 days, returning to rejoin the rest of the group at the beginning of November 1948.

In January 1949, Eighth Air Force planned a large celebration at Carswell Air Force Base. All of its assigned units were to participate in a coordinated flyover. Most of the Strategic Air Command&#x27;s bombers were to participate, along with its only &quot;Long Range&quot; fighter group, the 27th. The weather in Nebraska was horrible, with most airports in the Midwest forced to close on the day of the display. Kearney Air Force Base was hit with a blizzard, and paths were cut through the snow allowing the F-82s to take off and rendezvous with the bombers. This was seen as proof of the F-82&#x27;s capabilities in bad weather.

In early 1949, the 27th began carrying out long-range escort profile missions. Flights to Puerto Rico, Mexico, the Bahamas and nonstop to Washington, D.C. were carried out. For President Truman&#x27;s 1949 inauguration, the 27th FEW launched 48 aircraft to fly in review, along with several other fighter units, in formation down Pennsylvania Avenue. Another flyover of the newly dedicated Idlewild Airport in New York City soon followed, with the aircraft flying non-stop from Kearney AFB.

In March 1949, Kearney AFB was closed and the 27th FEW was reassigned to Bergstrom Air Force Base, Texas. Other long-range missions were flown cross-country, including simulated dogfights with Lockheed F-80 Shooting Stars. The 27th FEW began transitioning to the Republic F-84 Thunderjet in March 1950, and the F-82Es were largely surplus, with the last examples being phased out by September. A few were sent to Far East Air Forces for combat in Korea and some were sent to Alaska for bomber escort missions over the Arctic from Ladd AFB until 1953. The majority went to reclamation and were gone by 1952.

With the appearance of the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 over North Korea in late 1950, the B-29, as well as all of the propeller-driven bombers in the USAF inventory, were rendered obsolete as strategic offensive weapons. The straight-winged F-84Gs were ineffective against the MiG, and it took the swept-wing North American F-86 Sabre to counter them. It would take a new generation of swept-wing jet bombers, able to fly higher and faster, to survive the MiG-15 and subsequent Soviet interceptors. The era of large formations of bombers flying to a strategic target ended after the Korean War. Strategic bombing became a one-plane, one target mission, with the jet-powered Boeing B-52 Stratofortress flying higher and faster than most enemy interceptors. The escort fighter became redundant, and by 1957 SAC had inactivated the last of its strategic fighter escort wings.

===Air Defense Command===

The appearance of the Soviet Tupolev Tu-4 in 1947 posed a new threat to postwar USAAF planners, and with the start of the Cold War in 1948, led to the establishment of Air Defense Command (ADC) in the United States Air Force.

In 1947, the embryonic ADC was not particularly effective. During a number of simulated raids on the United States carried out by Strategic Air Command during the period 1947–1949, defending F-51 Mustangs and F-47 Thunderbolts repeatedly failed to find the incoming bombers, and were seldom in a position to shoot them down. Furthermore, when they did so, the bombers had already made their runs over intended targets.

The radar-equipped wartime Northrop P-61 Black Widow night fighter was found to be effective in locating and attacking the incoming SAC bombers, and also had the range to attack the bombers far from their intended targets. With no suitable jet interceptors, the P-61 transitioned to the ADC interceptor mission. Available F-61s were war-weary and night fighter F-82C/D models were modified into all-weather interceptors to replace them.

The production interceptor versions of the Twin Mustang were designated the F-82F and F-82G; the distinguishing feature between the F and G models was largely the nacelle beneath the center-wing that housed radar equipment (F-82F&#x27;s AN/APG-28 and F-82G&#x27;s SCR-720C18). In addition, the interceptor required numerous modifications. The right side cockpit was replaced with a radar operator&#x27;s position without flight controls. A long radar pod, resembling a sausage and irreverently known as a &quot;long dong&quot;, was attached to the underside of the wing center section, below the six .50 cal (12.7mm) machine guns and with its dish in front of the propellers to prevent interference. This unconventional arrangement did not affect the aircraft&#x27;s performance seriously. Additionally the unit could be jettisoned in an emergency, or for belly landings and was sometimes even lost during high-G maneuvers. F-82F models were designated for ADC units in the United States, while the F-82G models were deployed to Far East Air Forces for air defense of Japan and Okinawa. F-82s were not deployed to Europe.

The first F-82Fs began reaching ADC squadrons in September 1948. By the end of September, ADC had 29 F-82Fs. By the middle of 1949 the F-82 was replacing Black Widows in service with Air Defense Command along the west coast at Hamilton AFB, California (317th FIS) and McChord AFB, Washington (318th FIS, 319th FIS). East coast defense was the mission of the Twin Mustangs assigned to McGuire AFB, New Jersey (2d FIS, 5th FIS).

In addition to the forces in the Continental United States, the Caribbean Air Command 319th FIS at France Field in the Panama Canal Zone received 15 F-82Fs in December 1948 to replace Black Widows for defending the Panama Canal but remained there only briefly before being reassigned to McChord AFB in May 1949.

The Twin Mustang was replaced in ADC service during 1950–1951 by the Lockheed F-94 Starfire, the last being with the 318th FIS at McChord AFB in late 1951. Some went to Alaska, where they were modified into F-82H but most were scrapped.

===Far East Air Forces===

After World War II, the Northrop P-61 Black Widow was the Far East Air Forces (FEAF) main interceptor. However, a lack of spare parts and maintenance issues made it difficult to keep the war-weary aircraft in the air. Until an all-weather jet interceptor became available, the F-82G Twin Mustang was seen as the interim solution. The last operational P-61s were sent by the 68th and 339th Fighter (All Weather) Squadrons to the reclamation yard at Tachikawa Air Base in February 1950, with Twin Mustangs arriving as replacement aircraft.

In Far East Air Forces, there were three squadrons operating the Twin Mustang, consisting of 45 aircraft. The 4th Fighter (All Weather) Squadron was attached to the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing at Naha Air Base, Okinawa, tasked with providing air defense within the Twentieth Air Force&#x27;s area of responsibility during darkness and inclement weather. The 68th F(AW)S area would cover southern Japan from their base at Itazuke and the 8th Fighter Bomber Wing, with the 339th F(AW)S covering Tokyo and northern Japan from Johnson Air Base. FEAF had about 40 Twin Mustangs assigned to the command.

With the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, the F-82 was pressed into combat duty. On 25 June 1950, 68th Fighter Squadron F-82 aircrews on alert at Itazuke Air Base were told that North Korea had crossed the 38th Parallel. They were ordered to fly to the area and report any activity on the main roads and railroads. They arrived to find overcast conditions, with cloud tops at . The Twin Mustangs flew through the clouds using radar and broke out at , heading for Kimpo Airfield near Seoul. The pilots observed huge convoys of North Korean trucks and other vehicles, including 58 tanks, which had crossed into South Korea. The crews flew back through the clouds to Itazuke Air Base, where they were debriefed by a U.S. Army colonel from General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s staff. This reconnaissance flight is considered to be the first United States air combat mission of the Korean War.

With this information, along with other intelligence reports available to them, FEAF confirmed that the Korean People&#x27;s Army had, indeed, launched a full-scale invasion of South Korea. FEAF&#x27;s first priority, however, was to evacuate United States citizens. On the morning of 26 June, the nearby Norwegian freighter &quot;Reinholte&quot; was sent to Inchon harbor to evacuate non-military personnel from Seoul, which lay directly in the invasion route. A flight of Twin Mustangs from the 68th F(AW)S was dispatched to the area, arriving at dawn to provide air protection for the evacuation. Two of the F-82s were dispatched to fly over the road from Seoul, while others flew top cover over the Inchon docks. The patrol went without incident until about 1300, when a pair of Soviet-built aircraft (the exact aircraft type has never been determined) came out of the clouds. Orders given to the F-82 pilots prohibited any aggressive action; however, gun switches were activated when the enemy leader tightened up his turn and peeled off at the F-82s with his wing man in close tail. The F-82s dropped their external tanks, turned on combat power and started a climbing turn towards the North Korean aircraft. For some reason, the North Korean leader fired while too far away, with his bullets falling short of the F-82s which then pulled up into the clouds and above the overcast, putting them in a position to return fire if the North Koreans followed them. However, they did not, and no further contact was made for the rest of the day. The evacuation at Inchon was successfully carried out with a total of 682 civilians being transported to Sasebo, Japan.

Once the bulk of U.S. civilians had been evacuated out of South Korea by ship, the priority of FEAF changed to a military nature. The 339th F(AW)S received orders from Fifth Air Force to move all available aircraft, along with crews and equipment, to Itazuke Air Base to assist the 68th in providing air cover for the evacuation of Seoul. However, the 339th&#x27;s complement of aircraft were scattered over several bases at the time. Seven F-82s at Yokota AB were flyable and two were in the hangar undergoing maintenance for major repairs. Four other F-82s were at Misawa AB on TDY. The three at Yokota were dispatched immediately to Itazuke, as well as the four at Misawa, making a total of seven combat ready F-82Gs present for duty on 27 June. The 68th F(AW)S had a total of twelve operational F-82Gs. This, combined with what the 339th could contribute, was insufficient to meet the combat needs thrust upon FEAF. The F-80 Shooting Star was available, but its thirsty jet engine meant it could only remain over the airfield for a few minutes before having to return to base and it could not reach the forward combat area from Japan. No USAF P-51 Mustangs were available. FEAF ordered Twentieth Air Force to send eight F-82s from its 4th F(AW)S from Okinawa to Itazuke, making a total of 27 F-82s available for combat duty. This was commendable, considering that on 31 May 1950 a total of 32 F-82s existed within FEAF. With these combined squadrons, the 347th Provisional Fighter Group (AW) was formed.

Before dawn on 27 June, the 347th Provisional Group was up in the air over Korea, with a mission to provide cover for the Douglas C-54 Skymaster transports flying in and out of Kimpo Airfield as they moved the last civilians out. Fearing that the North Korean Air Force might try to shoot down the transport (a C-54 had been destroyed on the ground at Kimpo by North Korean fighters on 25 June), the Air Force requested air cover to protect the aircraft during takeoff. Fortunately, 339th Fighter All Weather Squadron (F(AW)S) with their F-82Gs were based at Yokota AB and the 68th F(AW)S was based at Itazuke AB Japan. With Lieutenant Colonel John F. Sharp in command, 27 F-82Gs of the 35 in Japan answered the call. Arriving in the early morning, they orbited Kimpo Airfield in three flights, each above the other. Suddenly, at 1150 hours, a mixed group of five North Korean fighters (Soviet-built Yak-9s, Yak-11s and La-7s) appeared, heading for the airfield. One of the Yak-11s immediately scored several hits on 68th F(AW)S pilot Lt. Charles Moran&#x27;s vertical stabilizer. Moments later, Lt. William G. &quot;Skeeter&quot; Hudson, also of the 68th F(AW)S, initiated a high-G turn to engage the Yak, and soon was closing in on the Yak&#x27;s tail. He then fired a short burst at close range, scoring hits with his six machine guns. The Yak banked hard to the right, with the F-82G in close pursuit. A second burst hit the Yak&#x27;s right wing, setting the gas tank on fire and knocking off the right flap and aileron. The North Korean pilot bailed out, but his observer, who was either dead or badly wounded, remained in the doomed aircraft. Parachuting down to Kimpo Airfield, the North Korean pilot was immediately surrounded by South Korean soldiers. Surprisingly, he pulled out a pistol and began firing at them. The South Korean soldiers returned fire, killing him. Moments later, Lt. Moran shot down an La-7 over the airfield, while a few miles away, Major James W. Little, commanding officer of the 339th F(AW)S, shot down another La-7. The C-54 was able to escape safely. Three of the five North Korean aircraft had been shot down, with pilot Lt. William G. &quot;Skeeter&quot; Hudson and radar operator Lt. Carl Fraiser scoring the first United States aerial &quot;kill&quot; of the Korean War.
In the following weeks, the F-82 pilots would exceed all expectations in aerial combat. On 28 June, orders came down for all F-82s to be used in heavy ground support against any North Korean activity found between the front lines and the 38th Parallel. Every F-82 which could be made ready for flight was pressed into combat service. Although Fifth Air Force needed every available aircraft to slow down the North Korean invasion force, it was hard to justify the release of all F-82s from their defensive responsibilities for the many key bases in Japan. It was decided to release all F-82s for combat except for a flight which was deployed from the 4th F(AW)S in Okinawa to Japan and a full squadron of F-80s for air defense. On 30 June, FEAF requested HQ USAF for an additional 21 F-82 aircraft, which was denied. In addition, the projected level of support which could be provided at the level of combat usage FEAF was experiencing was no more than 60 days due to a shortage of parts. The fact was that, when F-82 production ended in April 1948, no provision had been made for an adequate supply of spare parts, as the aircraft was not expected to remain in operational service once jet-powered aircraft were available. Further, the Air Force simply did not have that many F-82s in the first place (182 total operational aircraft), and did not want to weaken the F-82 units committed to the Pacific Northwest or Atlantic coast, or to draw from the fourteen F-82Hs in Alaska.

This was a heavy blow to FEAF planners, as they wanted to use the F-82 for escorting B-26 Invaders deep into North Korea and for searching out ground targets along the Han River. Making do with what they had was the order of the day, and maintenance crews were cannibalizing everything in sight in order to keep the maximum number of F-82s airborne. During the period 26–30 June, the 68th squadron flew 35 combat sorties, averaging five hours per sortie, with the 339th flying similar numbers of missions.

During those early days, the stress and strain of combat put on the crews was intense. However, by early July the chances of F-82s engaging in air-to-air combat was significantly reduced, as the F-80 Shooting Stars had effectively stopped North Korea&#x27;s air force from coming below the 38th parallel. The F-82s began flying strike and escort missions, along with night intruder sorties. Several F-82s took hits in their radar radomes, which were difficult to replace, and the radomes were removed, turning the aircraft into day fighters. In the ground support role, the F-82s could reach any part of the Korean battlefield with a total ordnance load of over . Each of the six machine guns carried 400 rounds. This firepower was well-used against numerous ground targets. The escort missions flown with the B-26s took F-82s deep into North Korea. Flying with external fuel tanks, it was necessary on many occasions for the Twin Mustangs to drop tanks, owing to the risk of fire or explosion if enemy fire hit one of the empty tanks. On 10 July, F-82s from the 4th and 68th squadrons participated in one of the biggest strikes of the war against ground targets. Joined by B-26s and F-80s, the aircraft hit massive amounts of North Korean road traffic. An estimated 117 trucks, 38 tanks and seven personnel carriers were destroyed, along with a large number of enemy troops killed when the B-26s destroyed a bridge at Pyongtaek, causing a massive jam.

On 5 July, the 339th Squadron was pulled out of combat and returned to Johnson AB. Shortly afterwards, the 4th Squadron returned to Okinawa, with the 347th Provisional Group being inactivated and control of the 68th Squadron being turned over to the 8th Fighter Group. The 339th had been in combat a total of 10 days (26 June – 5 July), flying a total of 44 combat sorties for which they had been given no training. The 68th Squadron was left to carry on the battle. Throughout July and August 1950, F-82s from the 68th Squadron attacked enemy trains, vehicles, and numerous buildings, and constantly strafed North Korean troops on the roads. On the night of 27 August, an element of F-82s was patrolling over South Korea over a thick overcast when they received an urgent request for air support from some hard-pressed ground troops. Darkness was approaching when they reached the area and found UN ground troops pinned down by a concentration of mortars. The F-82 pilots made several passes to get set up with the ground controller, and as soon as the enemy target was pinpointed, the heavily armed aircraft commenced an attack that would last 45 minutes and use up all their ordnance. When the aircraft pulled up for the last time, the mortar positions were silent and ground forces later showed over 300 enemy dead.

Beginning in October 1950, F-82s would start flying weather reconnaissance pre-dawn missions over North Korea. At the same time, the squadron would also be responsible for keeping at least three aircraft on alert on airfields in the Seoul area (K-13 (Suwon) and K-14 (Kimpo)) during the hours of darkness and bad weather. This would become the main mission for the F-82s for the balance of 1950, as the F-51s, F-80s and F-84s took on most of the combat ground attack missions which the F-82s had been pressed into at the beginning of the war. With the entry of the Chinese Communist forces into the war, the situation on the ground began to deteriorate rapidly. By late December, the 68th had begun flying two-aircraft missions during daylight and single-aircraft missions at night from Kimpo AB. On 7 January, FEAF ordered the 68th to start flying armed reconnaissance missions to check roads over southern North Korea as UN forces were rapidly withdrawing south before the Chinese onslaught. This was a nightmare as the Chinese were pouring south, and it appeared that the situation was becoming as it had been the previous June. On 26 January, the armed reconnaissance missions were discontinued and the F-82s were placed on continuous combat air patrols over Kandong Airfield near Pyongyang and over both of Pyongyang&#x27;s main airfields, (K-23, Pyongyang and K-24, Pyongyang East) to monitor enemy air activity. This was essential as any Chinese aircraft operating out of these bases would be in easy range of the UN front lines. The 68th&#x27;s efforts claimed 35 trucks destroyed, with damage to many others.

As 1951 progressed, the F-82s of the 68th Squadron continued its mission of air defense over Seoul and flying weather reconnaissance flights; however, its combat duties became more and more limited. The end of the line was rapidly approaching for the F-82 in Korea. By the end of August 1951, there were only eight operational F-82s with the 68th, with its replacement, the Lockheed F-94 Starfire arriving in Japan, taking over missions previously flown by the Twin Mustangs. In March 1952, the Starfire-equipped 319th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron arrived from Moses Lake AFB, Washington and took up residence at K-13. On 28 March 1952, the last F-82G was sent for cold-weather modification, and then deployed to Alaska. By mid-April 1952, the F-82s in Okinawa were also sent to Japan for modification and were also sent to Alaska. All-weather responsibilities in FEAF were now in the hands of the F-94 and the jet era.

1951 was the last full year of F-82 operations in Korea, as they were gradually replaced by the jet-powered F-94 Starfire. USAF claimed the Twin Mustangs destroyed 20 enemy aircraft, four in the air and 16 on the ground during the conflict.

During the Korean war, 22 F-82s were lost, including 11 in combat missions and 11 non-combat losses.

===Alaskan Air Command===
Modified F-82F/Gs for cold weather were designated as F-82H. Six were assigned initially to the 449th F(AW)S at Adak Island in December 1948 to replace their P-61 Black Widows in the Alaska Air Defense mission. The Twin Mustang was well-suited for the air defense mission in Alaska due to its long-range flying ability. In March 1949, the squadron was reassigned to Ladd AFB, near Fairbanks, where an additional eight (14 total) arrived.

In Alaska, the squadron would patrol over wide areas of Alaska as the Soviets flying from airfields in Siberia would often test the air defenses. Beginning in August 1950, the 449th began receiving the F-94 Starfire jet interceptor, and the F-82s were assigned to a separate detachment within the squadron. With the outbreak of the Korean War, tensions were high in Alaska, as it was feared that it would become a &quot;back door&quot; to Soviet aircraft striking North America. The Soviets were repeatedly testing the Alaskan air defenses, with the F-94s responding when radar stations alerted them to incoming aircraft. Intercepts were rare, with only a few instances of eye-to-eye contact with Soviet aircraft. The slower F-82s had a longer range than the F-94s, and the Twin Mustangs constantly patrolled over many Alaskan villages and towns. Periodically, the F-82s were used for long-range visual reconnaissance near several known rough airstrips on the Chukchi Peninsula that the Soviets had used during World War II as landing fields for lend-lease aircraft and checking for any activity. In addition, flights around the Nome area and along the western Alaskan coastline were made. Squadron records show the Twin Mustangs were flown over some of the most remote areas of the Territory, along what today is known as the &quot;North Slope&quot; and over very rugged interior regions.

The Twin Mustangs in Alaska operated further north than any other USAF aircraft at the time. In April 1952, they were flying escort duty for SAC B-36 Peacemaker bombers near Barter Island in the Beaufort Sea, near the most northerly tip of Alaska, about south of the North Pole. The F-82H made a brief but memorable appearance in the movie &quot;Top of the World&quot; (1955).

Another mission of the 449th was to act as a simulated invasion force during U.S. Army combat maneuvers during the summer months. Army ground units in Alaska were very limited in their movements due to the geography of the land. Most movements were up and down roads and paths and railroad rights-of-way. The F-82s would fly low along the terrain then pop up and initiate simulated strafing runs against them, causing the troops to take cover by hitting the muddy tundra. On occasions, the Twin Mustangs would also drop tear gas canisters, simulating gas attacks on the units.

The 449th would also assist the local government by bombing ice jams on the Tanana, Kuskokwim and Yukon Rivers. This helped avert disastrous floods in the region, by dropping bombs and firing rockets at the ice, thus allowing the rivers to keep flowing and not get clogged up.
Beginning in spring 1950, Strategic Air Command began replacing their F-82E bomber escorts and throughout the year, several were transferred to the 449th in Alaska. In February 1951, the Air Force ordered Alaskan Air Command that all the remaining F-82s in the Air Force inventory would all be transferred to Alaska. The Twin Mustangs would be used to support Army units in air-to-ground operations, and to use the F-94 Starfires for interceptor duty.

During 1951 and 1952, F-82Fs from the Air Defense Command 52d Fighter Group at McGuire AFB and 325th Fighter Group at McChord AFB were winterized and flown to Ladd AFB as replacements when those units transitioned to the F-94.

F-82Gs from Far East Air Force were also sent to Alaska, as jets took over combat duties over the skies of Korea. The FEAF F-82s, however, arrived in a badly corroded condition. Also, many of these aircraft which were sent to the 449th had high time on their airframes from long bomber escort and air defense flights, as well as the stress from combat duty in Korea causing many of them to be difficult to maintain. After four months at the 39th Air Depot Wing at Elmendorf, most were scrapped.

All in all, this provided AAC with a total of 36 various E, F, G and H model F-82s. By 1952, attrition had claimed many of the Twin Mustangs which were assigned to the squadron. The occasional long-range reconnaissance flight over the Bering Sea was still flown, given that the range of the Twin Mustang was much greater than that of the F-94. The right seat of the aircraft was usually occupied by an experienced flight mechanic. With the long patrol flights with high-hour aircraft, pilots began having more and more mechanical problems that forced them to land on crude flight strips. The mechanic usually could repair the aircraft well enough to get airborne and head straight back to Ladd AFB.

===Retirement===
The Twin Mustang had a very short operational life. About two years after its introduction to SAC, the F-82E was phased out of service in favor of the jet-powered Republic F-84E Thunderjet for bomber escort duties beginning in February 1950; the F-82Es were declared surplus by the end of the summer. Some were modified into F-82Gs and sent to Korea for combat as replacement aircraft, others were converted to F-82Hs and sent to Alaska, but most were sent to storage at Robins AFB, Georgia and ultimately reclamation.

In the Pacific, the F-82Gs flown in combat over Korea were replaced by the Lockheed F-94A Starfire starting in April 1951 with the last being sent to the Tachikawa Air Depot in early 1952. There, they were either scrapped or sent to Alaska after being modified to the F-82H configuration in Japan for cold-weather use. Air Defense Command&#x27;s F-82Fs began to be replaced by F-94As in June 1951, with most being declared excess by the end of the year and were sent to storage and ultimately reclamation at McChord AFB, Washington, although a few Twin Mustangs remained in ADC service towing aerial targets.

In Alaska, attrition and a lack of spare parts led to the withdrawal of the F-82 from the USAF inventory. Initially, 16 of the 36 aircraft became s and were the main source for spare parts to keep the others operational. By the spring of 1953, the number of aircraft available had dwindled to a handful, with two or three operational aircraft kept flying by cannibalizing others which were incapable of being repaired. Each aircraft was flown about 48 hours per month until it was impossible to keep them in the air on a reliable basis.

Ultimately, all were withdrawn from service. The last remaining F-82Hs were sent to Elmendorf AFB, Alaska, for disposal in June 1953. The last Twin Mustang that remained in the operational inventory (&quot;46–377&quot;) was originally configured as an F-82G model that had served with two different squadrons in Okinawa and Japan. It was flown to Ladd AFB in 1952 and modified as a winterized F-82H. It was sent to Elmendorf AFB, being officially retired on 12 November 1953.

Some of the planes in storage at Robins and McChord were turned over to museums as static displays. Also after the end of their USAF service, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) acquired four F-82s for research.

* XP-82-NA (NACA-14) Operated by NACA from 6 June 1948 to 5 October 1955. This aircraft was scrapped.
* XP-82-NA operated from October 1947 for ram jet tests until damaged in July 1950. Currently being restored in Douglas, Georgia.
* P-82B-NA (NACA-132) Operated from September 1950 to June 1957. This was the Betty Jo distance record aircraft and was used for ram jet tests. Was turned over to the USAF Museum.
* F-82E-NA (NACA-133) Used for high-altitude icing tests from January 1950, re-designated EF-82E. Sold for $1,600 in March 1954. Now being restored to flying condition in Anoka, Minnesota.

==Variants==

;NA-123
:Basic Development design. The NA-123 design was presented by North American Aircraft to the USAAF in February 1944. The design for the new aircraft was for a long-range fighter to penetrate deep into enemy territory. Its immediate role would be to escort the B-29 Superfortress bombers used in the Pacific Theater of Operations against Japan. The USAAF endorsed it at once. A letter contract to construct and test four experimental XP-82 aircraft (P-82 designation) gave way in the same month to an order for 500 production models.
;XP-82 / XP-82A
:Prototype. The USAAF accepted the first XP-82 in August 1945 and a second one in September. Both were equipped with Packard Merlin V-1650-23 and −25 engines. The third experimental aircraft, designated XP-82A, had two Allison V-1710-119 engines. It was accepted in October 1945. There is no evidence that the XP-82A was ever actually flown, due to problems with the Allison engines. The fourth XP-82A prototype (&quot;&quot;) was canceled.
;P-82B
:Planned production version. With the end of World War II, production plans were cut back significantly. Against the 500 P-82Bs initially planned, overall procurement was finalized on 7 December 1945 at 270 P-82s. Included were 20 P-82Bs already on firm order and later allocated to testing as P-82Z. The USAAF accepted all P-82Zs in fiscal year 1947. Two aircraft were accepted in January 1946, four in February 1947, and 13 in March 1947. By December 1949, no P-82Bs (by then redesignated F-82Bs) remained in the Air Force inventory. These P-82Bs were basically similar to the XP-82, but differed in having provisions for underwing racks.

;P-82C
:Night fighter version. A P-82B, (&#x27;) modified in late 1946, for testing as a night interceptor. The P-82C featured a new nacelle (under the center wing section) housing an SCR-720 radar. The SCR-720 was the same radar installation which was carried aboard the Northrop P-61 Black Widow, a considerably larger aircraft. The right-hand cockpit became the radar operator&#x27;s position. The production version was designated P-82G.
;P-82D
:Night fighter version. Another P-82B (&#x27;) modified with a different radar, the APS-4. The APS-4 was a much smaller set than the SCR-720, and operated in the waveband. As like the P-82C, the right-hand cockpit became the radar operator&#x27;s position. The production version was designated P-82F.
;F-82E
:Escort fighter version. The F-82E followed the F-82B, which it so closely resembled. They were equipped with two counter-rotating Allison liquid-cooled engines, V-1710-143 and V-1710-145. The first four F-82Es were redesignated as F-82As and were allocated for engine testing. After production delays by engine problems and additional testing, F-82Es entered operational service in May 1948. The Air Force accepted 72 F-82Es in fiscal year 1948 (between January and June 1948), and 24 in fiscal year 1949 (22 in July 1948, one in October, and one in December).

;F-82F/G/H
:Night fighter versions. A nacelle beneath the center-wing that housed radar equipment (F-82F&#x27;s AN/APG28 and F-82G&#x27;s SCR-720C18); automatic pilot; and a radar operator replacing the second pilot. When winterization was added to the F or G, it became an F-82H. Entered operational service in September 1948. One F-82G was accepted in fiscal year 1948 (February 1948), all other F-82s (F, G, and H models) in fiscal year 1949. The last F-82G and six winterized F-82Hs were received in March 1949.

===Production totals===
The Air Force accepted a total of 272 F-82s (including 22 prototype, test and early production aircraft). All examples were redesignated as F-82 in 1948. Specifically, the F-82 program consisted of two XF-82s, one XF-82A, 10 F-82Bs (known for a while as P-82Zs and all allocated to testing), four F-82As, 96 F-82Es, 91 F-82Fs, 45 F-82Gs and 14 F-82Hs. All models and variants of the P-82 were produced at North American&#x27;s Inglewood, California manufacturing plant.

==Accidents and incidents==
;25 July 1947
:The first North American XP-82, &quot;, crash landed at Eglin Field, Florida.
;4 May 1949
:A North American F-82F, &quot;, piloted by 2nd Lt. Andrew Wallace with 1st Lt. Bryan Jolley as his radar observer, crashed into an unfinished house in Hempstead, New York. The aircraft burst into flames, but Wallace escaped and rescued Jolley by smashing the latter&#x27;s canopy with a brick.
;29 September 1950
:A North American F-82G, &quot;, collided with a Lockheed F-80C Shooting Star, &quot;49-704&quot;, between Fukuoka and Ashiya, Japan.
;10 October 1987
:A North American F-82B, &quot;N12102&quot; (ex-&quot;&quot;), stalled on landing, collapsing the right landing gear. In September 2002, the Commemorative Air Force, the operator of &quot;N12102&quot;, traded the mostly restored aircraft and a damaged Lockheed P-38 Lightning for an airworthy P-38 from NPA Holdings. The National Museum of the United States Air Force, which had loaned the F-82B to the CAF, demanded that the aircraft be turned over to them per the loan agreement, in which the CAF would return the F-82B to the museum once they no longer wanted it. The aircraft was finally handed over to the museum in 2008 following a lawsuit filed by the United States Air Force against the CAF, and is currently on display, painted to represent an F-82G.

<text>Highway 3B is an alternate loop to the Crowsnest Highway (Highway 3) between Nancy Greene Lake and an area called Meadows, just west of Erie on the Crowsnest. Originally, Highway 3B went between Nancy Greene Lake to Trail, where the Crowsnest picked up the route to the Meadows area. One of its original component sections, the Rossland and Nancy Greene Lake was opened on the 1st of October 1965 at a cost of $3.5 million (equivalent to $34.4 million in 2022) 

Originally, Highway 3B only went between Nancy Greene Lake and Trail, where the Crowsnest picked up the route to the Meadows area. However, in 1978, Highway 3 was re-routed off the present-day Highway 3B alignment east of Trail because a new segment of Highway 3 between Castlegar and Meadows was opened.

==Route details==
Highway 3B&#x27;s western terminus is at the Crowsnest Highway near Nancy Greene Lake. The route travels southeast to the village of Rossland, where Highway 22 merges onto Highway 3B. The two highways share the route for the next east to Trail, where Highway 22 diverges north, with Highway 22A following Highway 3B east for to its departure just west of the village of Montrose for the Waneta border crossing. Highway 3B proceeds northeast for , through the villages of Montrose and Fruitvale, to the location of Meadows, where it again meets up with the Crowsnest.
