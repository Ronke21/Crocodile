<text>Daphne Eurydice Zuniga (; born October 28, 1962) is an American actress. She made her film debut in the 1982 slasher film &quot;The Dorm That Dripped Blood&quot; (1982) at the age of 19, followed by a lead role in another slasher film &quot;The Initiation&quot; (1984) two years later.

She went on to star in several comedy films, including Rob Reiner&#x27;s &quot;The Sure Thing&quot; (1985), opposite John Cusack, and the cult comedies &quot;Modern Girls&quot; (1986), and &quot;Spaceballs&quot; (1987). She also starred opposite Lucille Ball in the television drama film &quot;Stone Pillow&quot; (1985), and in the science-fiction horror sequel &quot;The Fly II&quot; (1989). Zuniga gained major exposure for her role as Jo Reynolds on the Fox primetime soap opera &quot;Melrose Place&quot; from (1992–1996). Other television credits include roles as Victoria Davis on &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; (2008–2012), and as Lynn Kerr on the drama series &quot;Beautiful People&quot;.

Zuniga has been active in environmental issues since the mid-2000s, and was a founding member of the Earth Communications Office. She has also worked with the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Waterkeeper Alliance, and Environment California.

==Early life==
Zuniga was born in San Francisco, California on October 28, 1962, to Agnes A. (née Janawicz) and Joaquin Alberto Zuniga. Her mother is a Unitarian minister, of Polish and Finnish descent, and her father, originally from Guatemala, was an emeritus professor of philosophy at California State University, East Bay. She has one sister, Jennifer Zuniga. In her early teens, Zuniga expressed interest in acting, and attended the Young Conservatory program of the American Conservatory Theater of San Francisco.

After her parents divorced, Zuniga moved with her mother and sister from Berkeley, California, to Reading, Vermont, where she spent the remainder of her teen years. Zuniga graduated from Woodstock Union High School in Woodstock, Vermont, in 1980, after which she returned to California and enrolled in the three-year theater program at the University of California, Los Angeles. After leaving college, Zuniga was close friends and roommates with fellow actress Meg Ryan. In Los Angeles, Zuniga studied acting with Larry Moss and Peggy Feury at the Loft Studio.

==Career==
===Early work===
Zuniga made her film debut in Stephen Carpenter&#x27;s slasher film &quot;The Dorm That Dripped Blood&quot; (1982), playing a supporting role as a college student. Two years later, she made her lead debut in &quot;The Initiation&quot;, another college-themed slasher co-starring Vera Miles and Clu Gulager. &quot;It was a great part,&quot; Zuniga recalled. &quot;I got to play twins: a good sister and an evil sister. I got shot in the back on-screen. It was pretty heavy for a first role.&quot;

She then appeared in the drama &quot;Vision Quest&quot; (1985), followed by a lead role in Rob Reiner&#x27;s &quot;The Sure Thing&quot; (1985), opposite John Cusack. The film was critically praised; critic Roger Ebert said of the film: &quot;The movie industry seems better at teenage movies like &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot;, with its sleazy shower scenes, than with screenplays that involve any sort of thought about the love lives of its characters. That&#x27;s why &quot;The Sure Thing&quot; is a small miracle.&quot; Shortly after, Zuniga was cast in the television drama film &quot;Stone Pillow&quot; (1985), playing a social worker in New York City who forms a bond with an elderly homeless woman, played by Lucille Ball. She also appeared in the comedy &quot;Modern Girls&quot; (1986), opposite Cynthia Gibb and Virginia Madsen.

In 1987, Zuniga was cast as Princess Vespa in Mel Brooks&#x27;s comedy &quot;Spaceballs&quot;, opposite Rick Moranis, Bill Pullman, and John Candy. Though the film received mixed critical reception, it later garnered a cult following. The next year, Zuniga appeared in a lead role in the blockbuster horror film &quot;The Fly II&quot; (1988), followed by the drama-comedy &quot;Staying Together&quot; (1989), and as a med student opposite Matthew Modine in the drama &quot;Gross Anatomy&quot; (1989).

===&quot;Melrose Place&quot;, film, and television===

In 1992, she was cast as Jo Reynolds in the Fox soap opera &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, and appeared on the show as a regular character until 1996. The role garnered Zuniga major exposure to television audiences, though her television career had begun in the early eighties with a minor role on &quot;Family Ties&quot; (1984) as a girlfriend of Alex P. Keaton. She also appeared in the 1995 miniseries &quot;Degree of Guilt&quot;.

In 1994, Zuniga appeared in the release of a video for Bob Seger&#x27;s previously released 1976 hit &quot;Night Moves&quot;. In the video version of the song, she and a pre-&quot;Friends&quot; Matt LeBlanc are shown in a 1960s drive-in theater, where Zuniga as a dark, edgy young woman becomes a visual fascination for LeBlanc as a clean-cut young man. In 2000, Zuniga appeared as a bartender in the music video for Evan and Jaron&#x27;s single &quot;Crazy for This Girl&quot;.

Later, Zuniga would work as a voice actor on the animated television series &quot;Stories from My Childhood&quot; (1998), and also had a lead role in the miniseries &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Clock&quot; (1996), an action thriller filmed in Seattle, Washington.

From 2005 to 2006, she was cast as Lynn Kerr on the ABC family series &quot;Beautiful People&quot;, and also had a recurring role in the series &quot;American Dreams&quot;. She also appeared in a recurring role as Victoria Davis on The CW series &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; between 2008 and 2012, appearing in over forty episodes. During this time, she appears in several made-for-television movies including &quot;Secret Lives&quot; (2005), &quot;The Obsession&quot; (2006), &quot;Christmas Do-Over&quot; (2006), &quot;Mail Order Bride&quot; (2008), and &quot;On Strike for Christmas&quot; (2010).

In 2007, Zuniga co-produced and co-directed (with Steven Latham) the documentary &quot;The Future We Will Create: Inside the World of TED&quot; — a look at the annual Technology, Entertainment and Design conference held in Monterey, California. She also starred in the scripted web series &quot;Novel Adventures&quot;, which premiered November 3, 2008 from CBS Interactive. In February and March 2008, Zuniga appeared onstage in a production of &quot;The Scene&quot; by Theresa Rebeck, at the San Francisco Playhouse.

Zuniga reprised her role as Princess Vespa from the 1987 film &quot;Spaceballs&quot;, by voice-over in the television spin-off &quot;&quot;. She also reprised her role from &quot;Melrose Place&quot; in an updated version, but it was short-lived, as the series was cancelled after just one season in 2009–10. She starred in 2010 in the hit Hallmark Channel film &quot;A Family Thanksgiving&quot;. In 2013, Zuniga appeared as a postal worker in the Hallmark Channel series &quot;Signed, Sealed, Delivered&quot;, as well as the television film based on the series and in &quot;Gone Missing&quot; with Lauren Bowles.

Zuniga appeared in a guest starring role in the VH1 scripted series &quot;Hindsight&quot; as Libby. In 2016, she was cast in a new TV movie for Hallmark Channel, &quot;When Duty Calls&quot;, with Judd Nelson and Daniella Monet.

More recently, Daphne Zuniga starred in &quot;Heartbeats&quot;, &quot;Witness Unprotected&quot; and &quot;A Christmas Arrangement&quot; with Miles Fisher.

In 2018, Zuniga directed her first feature film, &quot;The Protégé&quot;, with Keenan Tracey and Jeannette Sousa. It was released in 2019 under the title Deadly Assistant.

In 2019, she co-starred in the television film &quot;Gates Of Paradise&quot;, opposite Lizzie Boys and Jason Priestley, and &quot;Christmas In Paris&quot; with Karl E. Ländler. In 2020, she was a guest star in &quot;NCIS&quot; as Stacy Gordon, Navy commander.

In 2021, she was a guest star in &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; as Margot, with her old &quot;Melrose Place&quot; co-stars Josie Bissett and Laura Leighton.

In 2022, Zuniga appeared on &quot;Dynasty&quot; as Sonya Jackson.

==Activism==
Zuniga has cited her family&#x27;s camping trips to Yosemite National Park and Yellowstone as sparking her lifelong interest in the environment. &quot;The planet does nothing but support us,&quot; she said in a 2007 interview, &quot;and we are constantly committing crimes against nature.&quot; Zuniga has supported several environmental campaigns: In 2009, she was appointed by Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa to the Board of Directors of the Los Angeles River Revitalization Corporation, a not-for-profit development corporation charged with catalyzing sustainable development along the Los Angeles River.

Zuniga was a founding member of the Earth Communications Office (ECO), and has worked with the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Waterkeeper Alliance, and Environment California.

In addition to environmental causes, Zuniga has been active in the Multiple Sclerosis Foundation, the AIDS Project Los Angeles, and the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project.

==Personal life==
Zuniga&#x27;s younger sister Jennifer, also an actress, debuted in the film &quot;A Woman, Her Men, and Her Futon&quot; (1992). Zuniga attends private Buddhist meditation retreats to manage stress in her life.

In 2004, Zuniga suffered from mercury poisoning, which she attributed to overconsumption of fish. She said she had eaten sushi four times in the week prior to being taken to the emergency room and that her symptoms included weak memory, headaches, crying spells, rashes, and mild depression. After her diagnosis, Zuniga stopped consuming fish in addition to other meat.

Zuniga began dating businessman David Mleczko, whom she met on a blind date, in 2006. The two married in a private ceremony in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on June 8, 2019.

<text>Heritage streetcars or heritage trams are a part of the efforts to preserve rail transit heritage. In addition to preserving street-running rail vehicles, heritage streetcar operations can include upkeep of historic rail infrastructure. Working heritage streetcars are closely related to the growing global heritage railway movement and form a part of the living history of rail transport.

The vehicles are called streetcars or trolleys in North America and trams or tramcars elsewhere. The first two terms are often used interchangeably in the United States, with &quot;trolley&quot; being preferred in the eastern US and &quot;streetcar&quot; in Canada and the western US. In parts of the United States, internally powered buses made to resemble a streetcar are often referred to as &quot;trolleys&quot;. To avoid further confusion with trolley buses, the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) refers to them as &quot;trolley-replica buses&quot;.

Museums, heritage tram line operators, and amateur enthusiasts can preserve original vintage vehicles or create replicas of historic vehicles to re-create or preserve streetcar technology of the past. Heritage vehicles that are kept fully functional can be used on heritage tramlines or for charter traffic.

The Remise Museum (Depot Museum, or Carbarn Museum) in Vienna, opened in 2014, covers the history of public transport in the city of Vienna and offers an extensive tram collection to visitors.
The Styrian municipality centre Graz has a tram museum since 1971 located in the depot of Mariatrost. Another heritage tramway operates in Styria between the railway station of Mariazell and the nearby Erlaufsee, mainly using ex-Vienna streetcars. This line was recently electrified on longer sections and also extended towards the city center. In Innsbruck, a collection of the city&#x27;s historic trams is preserved and renovated – together with other Tyrolean railway vehicles – by the association Tiroler MuseumsBahnen, which has its museum in the old station of the Stubaitalbahn.

=== Belgium ===
In Belgium, there are three tram museums, one in Brussels – organizing several weekend rides to Tervueren and around the city – and other in Antwerp.

=== Germany === 

Woltersdorf Tramway located in Woltersdorf, Brandenburg, near Berlin, Germany. The line opened in 1913. In the 21st century, it is one of the smallest surviving town tram operators in Germany.
The Naumburg tramway, opened in 1907, closed as a regular public transport service in 1991 but reopened in 1995 as a heritage tramway with limited operation over a short section of the former route.

=== Hungary ===

In Hungary all of the four tram systems (Budapest, Debrecen, Miskolc, Szeged) have operating heritage trams.

In Budapest, heritage trams first operated in 1987. Its fleet contains quite a few preserved public transport vehicles (trams, buses, trolleybuses, even metro cars) spanning from the late 19th century until recent years, and there are more waiting to be repaired. Heritage services are mainly operated from April/May to September/October on weekends. There are both heritage and retro lines. The retro lines can be used with normal (seasonal) tickets, however, on heritage lines other, heritage (seasonal) tickets are needed. In 2019 there are two heritage tram lines. one retro tram line, one heritage bus line and one retro bus line operated regularly. Occasionally there are other lines in operation. There is also one vintage tram line - tram line 1956 - operating once-a-year in late October as a memorial to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956; it can be used with normal (seasonal) tickets.
In Debrecen, there are also a few vintage trams. They are operated less regularly, mostly on certain occasions.

In Miskolc, there are also a few vintage trams and buses. They are operated less regularly, mostly on certain occasions.

In Szeged, there are also a few vintage trams, buses and trolleybuses. Trams are in service on certain summer weekends. Otherwise, they are operated less regularly, mostly on certain occasions.

For about a one-month period near Christmas, each city operates lighted trams (trams that are decorated with LED strips and/or Christmas decoration). These trams operate on various lines around the cities in the late afternoons, evenings, and can be used by normal (seasonal) tickets usually. At the same time each of these cities, except Miskolc, light trolleybuses are operated in the same way as trams.

=== Italy ===

Turin operates the historical route 7, a two-way circular route around the town centre. Turin was the first town in Italy with tram lines served solely by historical trams. The inauguration of the heritage tramway took place during the celebrations of the 150th anniversary of national unity, in March 2011.

In the nearby metropolis of Milan, the continued, extensive use of the &quot;Series 1500 tram&quot; (Peter Witt streetcar) dating from 1928–1930 is an example of a heritage tram use that is so widespread across the system and blends into everyday urban life in the city to such an extent that it is not regarded as historic or heritage operation.

=== Netherlands ===

In Amsterdam the Electrisch Museumtramlijn operates historic trams over a length of former railway line. The tram networks of The Hague and Rotterdam have also their tram museums. The association Tramweg Stichting maintains and operates in every three cities its own vehicles, partly as collection of these museums.

=== Norway ===
In Bergen the Bergens Elektriske Sporvei has operated a short heritage tramway since 1993.
In Oslo, the Tramway Museum operates veteran trams on the tram network of Oslo on the first Sunday of every month.

=== Portugal ===

There are now three such heritage routes in Porto, as well as a tram museum. In Sintra, there is a seasonally operated heritage tramway.

=== Romania ===

STB in Bucharest maintains an extensive fleet of heritage trams on its tram system.

=== Russia ===

In Saint Petersburg, on Vasilyevsky Island the former Vasileostrovsky tram depot, which closed in the 1990s after the city&#x27;s extensive tram network was curtailed amid increasing automobile traffic, was converted into the Museum of Electrical Transport. Apart from operating excursions, the museum organizes museum-fleet rides along downtown tracks (including some sections no longer in use for regular tram service) during a number of public festivals and on some summer weekends. A heritage tram of the type that used to run from the inner city nearly to the nearby front line during the World War II siege of the city is installed as a war and tram memorial, not far from Avtovo metro station. A modern replica of a late-19th-century horsecar stands in front of Vasileostrovskaya metro station.

=== Spain ===

In Spain, a new heritage tramway was opened in A Coruña (La Coruña) in 1997. However, it has not operated since 2011. Tramvia Blau in Barcelona, also known as the Tibidabo tramway, has been in operation since 1904 but still uses trams built in 1904–15, and thus has become a heritage line; however, the line has been closed temporarily for reconstruction since 2018. Similarly, the tramway connecting Sóller with Puerto de Sóller, on the island of Mallorca, has been in operation since 1913 but still uses tramcars from the 1910s and 1920s. Therefore, it is a heritage line.

=== Sweden ===

In Malmö, a technical museum operates an in-street heritage tram line in the summer months. In Stockholm, a section of former route 7 was reopened in 1991 as a heritage tramway, using vintage cars.

There is another tram museum in Malmköping. Museispårvägen Malmköping runs along a short stretch of the former m|s|j between Malmköping and Hosjö.

In Göteborg, a heritage line is operated by the local tram association, Ringlinjen. The line is known as Lisebergs linjen. It runs alongside the regular trams between the central station and Liseberg amusement park. All trams on the line are vintage trams from the city. Ringlinjen also operates a tram museum in an old depot.

=== Switzerland ===

Historic trams operate at the Blonay–Chamby Museum Railway.

=== Turkey ===

Two separate heritage tramways operate in Istanbul; T2 on the European side of the Bosporus and T3 on the Asian side. The former opened in 1990 between Tünel (funicular station) and Taksim metro station, and the latter in 2003 in the suburb of Kadıköy.

A heritage tram line opened in 2003 in the city of Antalya, serving the Antalya Museum, the historic city centre, Hadrian&#x27;s Gate, and ending at the eastern end of Işıklar Road. Another one opened in 2011 in the city of Bursa.

=== United Kingdom and Crown dependencies===
In the United Kingdom the majority of tram lines were closed before the heritage movement began to flourish, the tracks and trams scrapped. Although trams have returned to several British cities since the 1990s, they are modern transportation systems (also known as light rail), not heritage operations. There are, however, three notable heritage tram operations in the UK and Crown dependencies.

*The National Tramway Museum at Crich, near Matlock, is located in an old limestone quarry in Derbyshire, and has a collection of preserved trams. Strictly speaking, this would be considered a tramway museum with an operating tram line, rather than being a heritage tramway.
*Among the heritage railways on the Isle of Man, at least the Manx Electric Railway &amp; Snaefell Mountain Railway both qualify as a heritage tramways as well.
*Otherwise, the Blackpool tramway is the only surviving first-generation urban tram system in the UK and provides a service running along the town&#x27;s promenade and also as far as Fleetwood using both historic and modern trams.

(There is also a modern heritage tramway in Birkenhead, Merseyside.)


== North America ==
=== Canada ===
* The Edmonton Radial Railway Society restores and operates historic streetcars on two lines in Edmonton, Alberta. Five streetcars transport guests around Fort Edmonton Park, and three streetcars – including one from Japan and another from Australia – operate on a second line that takes passengers between Whyte Avenue and Jasper Avenue, via the High Level Bridge. An additional 17 streetcars are either being restored by volunteers, or awaiting restoration. The organization is named after the Edmonton Radial Railway, which operated streetcars in the city for 43 years.
* The Toronto Transit Commission retains a fleet of heritage streetcars. All are currently out of service following the conversion of the system from trolley pole to pantograph current collection. Previously, two PCC and one Peter Witt cars were used on regular streetcar tracks, on a private-rental basis as well as for special events. The TTC often operated a PCC streetcar on route 509 Harbourfront on Sundays during the summer.

=== United States ===

The San Francisco Municipal Railway, or Muni, runs exclusively historic trolleys on its heavily used F Market &amp; Wharves line. The line serves Market Street and the tourist areas along the Embarcadero, including Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf.

Boston&#x27;s Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority runs exclusively PCC streetcars on its Mattapan Line, part of that authority&#x27;s Red Line. The historic rolling stock is retained because doing so cost less than would a full rebuild of the line to accommodate either a heavy rail line (like the rest of the Red Line or the Blue or Orange Lines) or a modern light rail line (like the Green Line). It is also unique in that it used almost exclusively by commuters and is not particularly popular with tourists (and thus may not really be a true heritage system, despite the historic rolling stock).

Dallas has the M-Line Trolley along McKinnney Avenue and other streets near downtown. Denver has the Platte Valley Trolley, a heritage line recalling the open-sided streetcars of the early 20th century. The VTA in San Jose, California, also maintains a heritage trolley fleet for occasional use on the downtown portion of a new light rail system opened in 1988. The MATA Trolley system in Memphis, Tennessee, opened in 1993 and is served exclusively by vintage and replica-vintage streetcars. Similar operations include the Metro Streetcar (opened in 2004) in Little Rock, Arkansas, and the TECO Line Streetcar (opened 2002) in Tampa, Florida – although these two are served entirely or almost entirely by replicas of vintage streetcars. Other cities with heritage streetcar lines include Galveston, Texas; Kenosha, Wisconsin; and El Paso, Texas. The National Park Service operates a system in Lowell, Massachusetts.

In San Francisco, parts of the cable car and Muni streetcar system (specifically the above-mentioned F Market &amp; Wharves line) are heritage lines, although they are also functioning parts of the city&#x27;s transit system. The cable cars are a U.S. National Historic Landmark and are rare examples of vehicles with this distinction. Located east of San Francisco is one of several museums in the U.S. that restore and operate vintage streetcars and interurbans, the Western Railway Museum.

The Fort Collins Municipal Railway operates Birney Safety Cars on a restored track that runs from City Park to Old Town in Fort Collins, Colorado. In Arkansas, in addition to the service in Little Rock, the Fort Smith Trolley Museum operates restored trams from the former streetcar systems of Fort Smith and Hot Springs, Arkansas, on an approximately line, year-round. One of the Birney cars in Fort Collins (No. 21) and the similar Birney car operating in Fort Smith (No. 224) are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

== South America ==
=== Argentina ===
In Buenos Aires, a heritage tram line was inaugurated in 1980 in the Caballito neighbourhood on existing vintage street tracks.

Buenos Aires also hosts the &quot;La Brugeoise cars&quot;, the Buenos Aires Metro (&quot;Subte&quot;) Line A rolling stock, since its inauguration in 1913. They were built by Belgian railway rolling stock manufacturer &quot;La Brugeoise, et Nicaise, et Delcuve&quot; between 1911 and 1919 for the Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company&#x27;s (, CTAA in Spanish) first metro line. They were originally designed to run both as metro and tramway cars, but they were refurbished in 1927 for underground use only. They are the oldest metro rolling stock in commercial service in the world as well as a tourist attraction and part of Buenos Aires cultural heritage. The A line also contains a vintage station, &quot;Perú&quot;. They have been in continuous use for a whole century from 1913 to January 2013 when they were replaced by new coaches, with an average of about 300,000 daily passengers, up from the 170,000 who traveled on them on their first day. Some of the coaches had already been preserved for touristic purposes, and now the rest of the fleet is under careful restoration and is intended to render service on weekends and holidays.

=== Brazil ===
Santos: After briefly operating a short heritage line along Embaré Beach in the mid-1980s, the city of Santos in 2000 opened a new heritage tramway in the historic Valongo district, using a car built in 1911 and retaining the former city system&#x27;s peculiar rail gauge of . The line is being extended, and additional trams have been added.

Belém: A heritage tramway was opened in the city of Belém in 2005.

Campinas: A heritage tramway has been in operation at Campinas&#x27;s Parque Portugal since 1972.
Rio de Janeiro: The Santa Teresa Tramway, which has operated in the Santa Teresa district of Rio de Janeiro since the 19th century, is not primarily a tourist line but can be considered a heritage tramway because of its continued use of vintage or, since 2015, faux-vintage tramcars.

Auckland also has a short heritage line loop in the Wynyard Quarter District called the Dockline Tram, which opened in 2011, closed several times due major roadworks, and reopened in 2021. It is operated on behalf of the Auckland Council&#x27;s Development arm by the Museum of Transport &amp; Technology.

<text>Tabal ( and ), later reorganised into Bīt-Burutaš () or Bīt-Paruta (), was a Luwian-speaking Syro-Hittite state which existed in southeastern Anatolia in the Iron Age.

==Name==

The name given to the kingdom by the Neo-Assyrian Empire was likely an Akkadian term meaning &quot;bank&quot; or &quot;shore&quot; of a body of water, in reference to the kingdom and region of Tabal being on the southern bank of the Halys river.

Due to an absence of relevant Luwian inscriptions, the native name of the kingdom of Tabal is still unknown.

=== Usage ===
The kingdom of Tabal was located in a region bounded by the Halys river, the Taurus Mountains, the Konya Plain and the Anti-Taurus Mountains, and which was occupied by a cluster of Syro-Hittite states.

The Neo-Assyrian Empire used the name of Tabal in a narrow sense to refer to the kingdom of Tabal and in a broader sense to designate both this larger region of which the kingdom was part of and to the other states within this region collectively.

Modern scholarship therefore designates the kingdom as &quot;Tabal proper&quot; to distinguish it from the broader region of Tabal.

==Geography==
===Location===
The kingdom of Tabal was one of the several states located in the larger region of Tabal, and was the northernmost and largest of them: the territory of Tabal proper was bounded to the north by the Halys river and it covered the areas surrounding what is presently the city of Kayseri in the modern Turkish provinces of Kayseri and Niğde until as far south as the region corresponding to present-day Kayseri.

Some inscriptions referencing its king Tuwattīs II nevertheless suggest that the kingdom of Tabal might have had some control in the areas to the north of the Halys river as well.

===Settlements===
The capital of Tabal has still not been discovered, although it might have been located at the site of present-day Kululu, and another city belonging to this state was discovered at Sultanhan, itself in the western whereabouts of Kululu.

===Neighbours===
The most important neighbour of Tabal in the 8th century BCE was the kingdom of Tuwana, which was located immediately to the north of the entrance to the Taurus mountains. The southern border of Tabal was formed by the Erdaş and Hodul mountains, which separated it from Tuwana.

==History==
===Iron Age===
====Neo-Hittite period====
=====Kingdom of Tabal=====
A possible but uncertain early reference to Tabal from the Late Bronze Age might have been the &quot;Land of Tuali&quot; () whose king was member of a coalition of 23 rulers whom the Middle Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser I defeated during his first campaign in Nairi. The name Tuali might have been an Akkadian form of a Luwian original name Tuwattīs which had experienced the Luwian sound shift from to . The name Tuali/Tuwattīs appears to have belonged to an ancestral king of the kingdom, whose name was then reused by the later kings of this state.

Another possible but uncertain reference to Tabal might have been the prince Tuwattīs whose image was carved in the Lion Gate of Malatya.

======Tabalian campaign of Shalmaneser III======
The first certain mention of Tabal proper is from the records of the Neo-Assyrian king Shalmaneser III&#x27;s () campaign of 837 BCE in the region of Tabal, which was then constituted of 24 states.

During this campaign, Shalmaneser III crossed the Anti-Taurus Mountains, invaded the lands of the Tabalian king Tuwattīs I and destroyed the settlements in his kingdom, forcing the latter to flee to his capital of Artulu. Shalmaneser III then besieged Artulu, but Tuwattīs I immediately surrendered when the Neo-Assyrian army surrounded his city, and his son Kikki paid tribute to Shalmaneser III, as did the rulers of the 23 other states of the region without fighting, after which Kikki might have been installed by Shalmaneser III as the new king of Tabal.

The position of Tuwattīs I in the dynastic history of Tabal is uncertain: he might have founded a new dynasty in Tabal in the 8th century BCE; or he might have alternatively been a member of an older dynasty founded by an ancestor of his.

The kings of the region of Tabal offered tribute to Shalmaneser III again in 836 BCE, after he had conquered the fortress of Uetaš during campaign in Melid.

During the century following the campaign of Shalmaneser III, the kingdom of Tabal had absorbed several of the nearby small states in the Tabalian region, likely through aggressive expansionism, to grow into the largest, and northernmost, of its six main kingdoms, with the others being Atuna, Tuwana, Ištuanda, Ḫubišna, and Šinuḫtu.

======Submission to Urartu======
Around , Tabal had submitted to the Urartian king Argišti I and paid tribute to him. Argišti I&#x27;s annals recording this event referred to Tabal as , which has been variously interpreted as meaning:
*&quot;land of the sons (descendants) of Tuate (Tuwattīs)&quot; ();
*or &quot;land belonging to Tuate (Tuwattīs)&quot; ();
*or &quot;the one of Tuate, the land.&quot;
This mention of Tabal in the Urartian records suggests that Tabal held some importance in Central Anatolia.

======Submission to the Neo-Assyrian Empire======
By , the Tabalian region, including Tabal proper, had become a tributary of the Neo-Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser III (), either after his conquest of Arpad over the course of 743 to 740 BC caused the states of the Tabalian region to submit to him, or possibly as a result of a campaign of Tiglath-pileser III in Tabal.

In the middle of the 8th century BCE, Tabal was ruled by the king Tuwattīs II, who might have been a descendant of Kikki. Some time before 738 BC, Tuwattīs II, along with the kings Warpalawas of Tuwana and Ašḫiti of Atuna, offered tribute to Tiglath-pileser III; Tabal&#x27;s tribute to the Neo-Assyrian Empire at this time consisted of horses, oxen and sheep.

======Regional hegemony======
Several inscriptions by people referring to themselves as servants of Tuwattīs II found to the north-east of the region around Kululu and Sultanhan, and a lead strip mentioning a &quot;Lord Tuwattīs&quot; to the north of the Halys river, suggest that Tabal was during this time using one of these two locations as a base for consolidating its power in northwestern Cappadocia. Thus, Tuwattīs II, and possibly his son Wasusarmas after him, had interests in the region to the north of the Halys river, and the region to the north of the Halys river might itself have been ruled by either Tabal directly or by a vassal of Tuwattīs II named Muwatalis.

One sub-kingdom within the territory of Tabal was ruled by a man named Ruwas who styled himself as the &quot;servant of Tuwattīs&quot; on several stelae erected in the Tabalian capital. This Ruwas described himself as the &quot;lord-house&quot; (, ) of his overlords and styled himself as &quot;the sun-blessed one&quot; (, ) which were titles used by caretaker rulers who were in the service of great rulers.

Tuwattīs II was succeeded by his son, Wasusarmas, who was also a tribute-paying vassal of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

Wasusarmas regarded himself as the local hegemon of the Tabalian region, and he styled himself using the prestigious titles of &quot;Great King&quot; () and &quot;Hero&quot; (). Along with the revival of this title by the possibly contemporary king Ḫartapus who ruled a state further to the west, this was the first time that a Luwian ruler had adopted these imperial Hittite titles after the end of their use by the rulers of Karkamiš in the 10th century BC.

Wasusarmas&#x27;s use of these titles for himself and his father appears to have been significant enough that the various rulers of the Tabalian region either identified or rejected it, and some other Tabalian rulers, such as Warpalawas II of Tuwana and Kiyakiyas of Šinuḫtu, might possibly have been his vassals.

Thanks to the renewed interest of powers like the Neo-Assyrian into the Tabalian region at this time, Wasusarmas was able to build his kingdom into a powerful and influential state: Wasusarmas&#x27;s expansionist ventures brought him into conflict with a coalition of eight enemy rulers attempting to encroach on the Tabalian region that was led by the king of Phrygia or by king Ḫartapus in the Konya-Karaman Plains, and which Wasusarmas claimed to have defeated with the help of the kings Warpalawas II of Tuwana, Kiyakiyas of Šinuḫtu, and the otherwise unknown king Ruwandas. This victory allowed Wasusarmas to expand his borders to the west.

======Deposition of Wasusarmas======
Despite being a Neo-Assyrian tributary, Wasusarmas continued using the titles of &quot;Great King&quot; and &quot;Hero&quot;; since the Neo-Assyrian Empire sought to prevent local rulers from becoming too powerful, Tiglath-pileser III accused Wasusarmas of acting as his equal, in consequence of which he deposed him around to and replaced him as king of Tabal with a man named Ḫulliyas. The deposition of Wasusarmas resulted in a power vacuum in the Tabalian region, and no subsequent ruler from the Tabalian region claimed the title of &quot;Great King&quot; again after him.

The identity of Ḫulliyas is still uncertain: although Neo-Assyrian sources referred to him as a commoner, he might have instead been the same individual as Ḫulis the nephew of Ruwas, the vassal of Tuwattīs II, who had erected a stele in his uncle&#x27;s honour in the Tabalian capital of Artulu, or alternatively he could have been of northern Syrian origin.

The deposition of Wasusarmas and his replacement by Ḫulliyas did not solve the problems which Neo-Assyrian power was facing in Tabal, and Neo-Assyrian policy in the Tabalian region throughout the 8th century BCE would continue being characterised by an inability to find any compatible partners there. Thus, in 726 BCE Tiglath-pileser III&#x27;s son and successor, Shalmaneser V (), deported Ḫulliyas along with his whole family to Assyria, possibly because Ḫulliyas had conspired with Phrygia.

The situation of Tabal during the exile of Ḫulliyas is unknown, although the deportation of its king likely to have resulted in the leadership vacuum there. Alternatively, another Tuwattīs, possibly a son of Wasusarmas II, might have been installed on the throne of Tabal after the deportation of Ḫulliyas.

Meanwhile, the kingdom of Atuna appears to have benefited from the deportation of Ḫulliyas, with the power vacuum in Tabal proper having allowed it to become a local power in the Tabalian region.

======Between Phrygia and Assyria======
Following the union of the Phrygians and the Muški under the Phrygian king Midas, his kingdom became a major rival to Neo-Assyrian power in eastern Anatolia, and the region of Tabal became contested between the Neo-Assyrian and Phrygian empires.

Midas tried to convince the still independent local rulers of Tabal to switch their allegiances to Phrygia, and several of them accepted his offer. Shalmaneser V&#x27;s successor, Sargon II (), reacted by restoring Neo-Assyrian power in the Tabalian region, from where deported the rebellious rulers to Assyria and gave their cities to rulers who had remained loyal to him, and settled Assyrians and other foreigners in Tabal.

======Kingdom of Bīt-Burutaš======
Sargon II&#x27;s main preoccupation regarding the region of Tabal was to secure the whole of it from Phrygian attacks from the north-west, and, fearing that the void left in the leadership of Tabal would worsen the threat posed by Phrygia and Urartu to Neo-Assyrian interests in Anatolia, in 721 BC he restored Ḫulliyas to Tabal&#x27;s throne after returning him and his family back there. Thus, the Neo-Assyrian Empire had to navigate a situation where it sought to prevent local rulers from becoming too powerful while also preventing chaos which could allow other powers to become influential there or where Neo-Assyrian power would have no partners in the region.

This restoration of Ḫulliyas on the throne of Tabal might itself have been linked to the power struggle within the Neo-Assyrian Empire which led to Sargon II seizing power from Shalmaneser V. It is possible that the tradition of Hieroglyphic Luwian inscriptions in the kingdom of Tabal might have ended with the appointment of Ḫulliyas, whose deportation to Assyria before his restoration as well as the re-education of his son at the Neo-Assyrian court might have distanced him from the Syro-Hittite cultural traditions.

By this time, Tabal&#x27;s western borders had expanded so as to reach the region of modern Konya and its southern borders extended to the northern border of the country of Ḫilakku.

Sargon II soon appointed Ḫulliyas&#x27;s son Ambaris as his successor to the kingship of Tabal: Ambaris had himself been re-educated in Assyria during his family&#x27;s exile there, and his pledges of loyalty had convinced Sargon II that Ambaris could be trusted and be placed on the throne of Tabal. Additionally, Sargon II desperately tried to ensure the loyalty of Ambaris and augment his position above those of the other Tabalian kings by marrying him to his own daughter, Aḫat-abiša, and gave them Ḫilakku as dowry.

However, since Ḫilakku itself had remained mostly independent of Neo-Assyrian authority, it is unlikely that Ambaris ever held any concrete power there. Sargon II&#x27;s conferring of authority over Ḫilakku to him appears to have instead been due to the unavailabiliy of any other land that he could offer Ambaris after he had given the northwestern part of Wasusarmas&#x27;s kingdom, corresponding to the region of present-day Suvasa, Topada and Göstesin, to Kurdis of Atuna when he had handed over the territory of Šinuḫtu to him in 718 BC after he had repressed the rebellion of its king Kiyakiyas.

Sargon II himself claimed to have &quot;widened the land&quot; which he had given to Ambaris, and this new enlarged and reorganised kingdom of Tabal was given the new name of Bīt-Burutaš: this reorganisation was part of Sargon II&#x27;s attempt to establish a centralised authority in the region of Tabal in the form of a single united kingdom incorporating most of the region under a ruler whom he could trust so as to more efficiently impose Neo-Assyrian authority there and better contain the threat posed by the Phrygian king Midas to Neo-Assyrian power in Anatolia.

Thus, by reorganising Tabal as Bīt-Burutaš and appointing Ambaris as its king, Sargon II was trying to reinforce Neo-Assyrian authority in the Tabalian region against Phrygian expansionism and attempting to restore Neo-Assyrian control there. However, likely beginning in 714 BC, Ambaris came under pressure from Midas, who attempted to persuade him to renounce Neo-Assyrian allegiance and join him, initially through diplomatic means and later through military threats.

Since Ambaris had been educated at the Assyrian court along with Neo-Assyrian princes, it is possible that his experience had instilled in him a significant sense of Assyrian identity, and he might therefore have possibly not have continued the local monumental traditions of the Tabalian region.

Ambaris himself came under pressure from Midas, who attempted to persuade him to renounce Neo-Assyrian allegiance and join him, initially through diplomatic means and later through military threats. Because Phrygia directly bordered Bīt-Burutaš in the south-east, and Ambaris was not capable of efficiently defending his new kingdom against the Phrygian armies who were able to rapidly march to his cities, he therefore found himself forced to make the difficult decision of remaining loyal to Sargon II and lose his kingdom and throne to Phrygia and Urartu, or allying with these latter rivals of the Neo-Assyrian Empire and face a military response by Sargon II.

With Sargon II occupied by his campaign in Urartu in 714 BC, Ambaris was left with no significant military support from the Neo-Assyrian Empire with which he could have defended Bīt-Burutaš, and therefore had little choice but to accept an alliance with Phrygia and renounce his allegiance to the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

Despite Sargon II having successfully attacked and defeated Urartu in 714 BC, the new Urartian king Argišti II continued the attempts to expand Urartian influence on the Neo-Assyrian vassals, especially those to the west of the Euphrates, on the Anatolian plateau and the south-east coast of Anatolia.

Thus, both Phrygia and Urartu were trying to expand their power in these regions and challenge the sole supremacy of the Neo-Assyrian Empire there. Facing increased pressure from both of these powers, Ambaris communicated with them seeking guarantees that they would protect him should he break his ties with the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

======Annexation by the Neo-Assyrian Empire======
Neo-Assyrian intelligence however intercepted Ambaris&#x27;s messages to Phrygia and Urartu, causing him to lose favour with Sargon II, who accused him of conspiring with Phrygia and Urartu, and consequently deported Ambaris, his family and his chief courtiers to Assyria in 713 BCE.

Following the deportation of Ambaris, Bīt-Burutaš was annexed into the Neo-Assyrian Empire and made into a province, and Sargon II appointed the eunuch Aššur-šarru-uṣur as governor of Que based in Ḫiyawa who also held authority on Hilakku and Bīt-Burutaš and had general oversight on Tuwana. Thus, Bīt-Burutaš and Ḫilakku were placed under the administration of a Neo-Assyrian governor and were settled by people deported from other regions newly conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire, putting Tabal under direct Assyrian rule.

Sargon II also handed over part of the territory of Bīt-Burutaš to Warpalawas II of Tuwana, who had remained a loyal subject of the Neo-Assyrian Empire and had now become a token ruler under the authority of Aššur-šarru-uṣur.

Some fortifications in Tabal, along the tops of the Kulmaç hills and over a hill to the north-west of what is presently Topada might have been built in connection to the annexation of Bīt-Burutaš.

The annexation of Bīt-Burutaš and the deportation of Ambaris was impactful enough that it was able to convince the king Kurdis of Atuna, who had abandoned his allegiance to the Neo-Assyrian Empire and become a vassal of Midas, to submit to Sargon II again. However, around , Atuna and Ištuanda launched a joint attack on the cities of Bīt-Burutaš, although it is unknown whether Kurdis was still the king of Atuna by then.

The hostilities between the Neo-Assyrian and Phrygian empires soon came to and end by 710-709 BC, which in turn provided to Sargon II the opportunity to consolidate Neo-Assyrian rule over Anatolia, and especially the kingdoms of Tabal.

======End======
In 705 BCE, Sargon II campaigned against the Cimmerians in Tabal but he died in battle against one Gurdî of Kulummu, ending Neo-Assyrian direct rule there, with the Tabalian region consequently becoming independent again while also becoming destabilised and vulnerable to the attacks of the Cimmerians.

With Sargon II&#x27;s death, Bīt-Burutaš suddenly disappeared from Neo-Assyrian sources. And, after this, the Neo-Assyrian Empire stopped intervening in Anatolia while direct presence of Neo-Assyrian officials and military in Central Anatolia ceased being attested. And after Sargon II&#x27;s son and successor, Sennacherib, had attacked Gurdî at Til-Garimmu but failed to capture him, the Neo-Assyrian Empire instead became limited to protecting its newly reduced borders running from Que to Melid to Ḫarran.

======Aftermath======

The subsequent fate of Tabal/Bīt-Burutaš is unclear, although, by the time that Sennacherib had been succeeded by his son Esarhaddon, the whole Tabalian region reappeared as a single kingdom under the reign of rulers such as Iškallû and Mugallu who were independent of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, suggesting that Tabal had been reconstituted after the end of Neo-Assyrian rule over Anatolia.

Some Georgian linguists see a connection between the Kartvelian languages and the land of Tabal, citing the name of the  mentioned living on the Black Sea shores of Anatolia in the 5th century BCE by Herodotus of Halicarnassus and Xenophon.

<doc id="675878" wikidata="Q1514095" url="?curid=675878" title="The Great White Hype">
<text>The Great White Hype is a 1996 American sports comedy film directed by Reginald Hudlin. It stars Samuel L. Jackson, Peter Berg, Damon Wayans, Jeff Goldblum, Jon Lovitz, Cheech Marin, John Rhys-Davies, Salli Richardson and Jamie Foxx.

The film satirizes racial preferences in boxing, and was inspired by Larry Holmes&#x27;s 1982 fight with Gerry Cooney (who was known as &quot;The Great White Hope&quot;) and Mike Tyson&#x27;s 1995 return fight vs. Peter McNeeley. Entertainment Weekly called Rev. Fred Sultan (Samuel L. Jackson) a &quot;Don King-clone.&quot;

The film was distributed by 20th Century Fox and was released on May 3, 1996.

==Plot==
James &quot;The Grim Reaper&quot; Roper (Damon Wayans), the undefeated heavyweight boxing champ of the world, defeats his latest challenger with ease and visits an after-party thrown by Rev. Fred Sultan (Samuel L. Jackson), a conniving and manipulative businessman who also acts as Roper&#x27;s fight promoter. After telling the attendees that the fight was a financial flop, Sultan concludes that boxing events have become far less profitable because audience members are tired of watching only black boxers fight each other. Sultan predicts that a white contender, even one without a viable chance of winning, would create a huge payday like the Larry Holmes vs. Gerry Cooney fight; next, he vows to either find or &quot;create&quot; a white contender for Roper to face in the ring.

After failing to find a white boxer currently in the sport suitable by any means, Sultan discovers that Roper actually lost to a white boxer, Terry Conklin (Peter Berg), back in his amateur days. Sultan and his unethical crew find Conklin in Cleveland, where he fronts a heavy metal band, advocates peace and Buddhism, and constantly preaches progressive social issues. Conklin is uninterested in returning to boxing to face Roper, though he is eventually coaxed to do so through ego-stroking by Sultan and a promise of $10 million to help his quest in eradicating homelessness.

Conklin arrives in Las Vegas and starts to train for his return to the ring. Thanks to shady dealing, Conklin suddenly is named the No. 8 challenger in the world. Boxing pundits and officials easily see the scam unfolding and label the fight a disgrace. However, the prospect of a white vs. black fight continues to hold the prospect of a large payoff. Conklin gets in shape quickly, regaining some of his old form, while Roper dismisses the fight as a joke - to the point where he puts on 25 pounds and is barely able to run after an ice cream truck.

Meanwhile, crusading television journalist Mitchell Kane (Jeff Goldblum) has finally gathered enough evidence to disgrace the unethical Sultan, but at the last moment, Kane is seduced by power and joins Sultan&#x27;s squad. As Sultan&#x27;s ego grows, Kane sees an opportunity to usurp his position. Though Conklin was never believed to stand a chance in the fight, Kane recognizes that he may actually win, and has Conklin sign with him rather than Sultan. Throughout all this, the true top contender to the heavyweight title, Marvin Shabazz (Michael Jace), and his trainer Hassan El Ruk&#x27;n (Jamie Foxx) are repeatedly denied the rightful chance to a fight, and they proceed to cause a headache for everyone involved in the hype scam.

Sultan and his crew use the media to promote the fight and publicize the white vs. black angle, even fabricating an Irish ancestor for Conklin. The racial angle works, and money starts to pour in. On the fight day, Millions tune into Pay-Per-View on the day of the fight, and Kane is confident about a new era beginning with a Conklin upset. The fight begins, and Conklin and Roper trade several punches and insults with each other, appearing to be evenly matched. Conklin then hits Roper with a strong punch, hurting him and sending him into the ropes. Roper, feeling the effects of his lack of conditioning, knows he must end the fight immediately. He attacks Conklin with a barrage of punches that knocks him to the canvas, ending the fight. Conklin quits boxing again, Kane&#x27;s plan falls short, Sultan reaps a huge profit, and Roper&#x27;s critics are silenced. Shabazz, refusing to wait any longer, attacks Roper inside the ring and gets into a fistfight with him, while Sultan screams to not give away something they can sell. Shabazz knocks Roper out, and Sultan steps over Roper&#x27;s unconscious body and announces that the two boxers will face each other next.

The film ends with Sultan, his crew, Roper and hundreds of attendees and paparazzi celebrating their financial success.

==Cast==
==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 42% based on reviews from 24 critics. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade C+ on scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert gave the film 2 out of 4 and wrote: &quot;It starts out well, as a wicked satire on professional boxing, and then loses its energy, tires of juggling its characters and ends so abruptly at 91 minutes that it feels like the last reel is missing.&quot;

==Soundtrack==

A soundtrack containing rap music was released on April 30, 1996 by Epic Records. It peaked at 93 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and 27 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. Camp Lo&#x27;s single &quot;Coolie High&quot; became a minor hit, peaking at 25 on Rap charts.

<text>Adelphi University is a private university in Garden City, New York, United States. Adelphi also has centers in Downtown Brooklyn, Hudson Valley, and Suffolk County in addition to a virtual, online campus for remote students. It is the oldest institution of higher education in suburban Long Island. As of 2019, it had about 7,859 undergraduate and graduate students.

==History==

===Adelphi College===
Adelphi University began with the Adelphi Academy, founded in Brooklyn, New York, in 1863. The academy was a private preparatory school located at 412 Adelphi Street, in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn, but later moved to Clinton Hill. It was formally chartered in 1869 by the board of trustees of the City of Brooklyn for establishing &quot;a first class institution for the broadest and most thorough training, and to make its advantages as accessible as possible to the largest numbers of our population.&quot; One of the teachers at the Adelphi Academy was Harlan Fiske Stone, who later served as the Chief Justice of the United States.

In 1893, Charles Herbert Levermore was appointed as the head of Adelphi Academy. Seeking to establish a liberal arts college for the City of Brooklyn, Levermore received a charter from the Board of Regents of the State of New York, officially establishing Adelphi College on June 24, 1896. The college received its charter through the efforts of Timothy Woodruff, former Lieutenant Governor of New York and future first president of the board of trustees. Adelphi was one of the first coeducational institutions to receive a charter from the State of New York. At the time of its foundation, the college numbered only 57 students and 16 instructors. The Adelphi Academy continued to exist as a separate but nonetheless connected entity to the college. The new college was located in a building behind the Adelphi Academy, on the corner of St. James&#x27;s Place and Clifton Place, in Brooklyn. The building that originally housed Adelphi is now used by Pratt Institute for their School of Architecture. 

In 1912, Adelphi became a women&#x27;s college. In 1922, the school raised over one million dollars to expand the overcrowded facilities in Brooklyn. In 1925, Adelphi College severed its ties with the Adelphi Academy, the latter closing in 1930. In 1929, the college moved from its founding location in Brooklyn to the current location of its main campus in Garden City, New York. The original &quot;academy&quot; continues to function as a P–12 school in Brooklyn. The original three buildings of the Garden City campus, Levermore Hall, Blodgett Hall and Woodruff Hall, were designed by McKim, Mead and White. 
In 1938, the Dance Program was founded by the world-famous dancer Ruth St. Denis. In 1943, the School of Nursing was established in response to the need for nurses due to American involvement in World War II. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the opening of two federally funded residence halls on campus, in a speech entitled &quot;The Challenge of Nursing for Young Women Today.&quot;

In 1946, after World War II ended, Adelphi reverted to a coeducational college and started admitting new students on the federal GI Bill. New sports teams were created following the readmission of men to the school. In 1952, the first program for clinical psychology was established at the school; it was the forerunner to the Institute for Advanced Psychological Studies, now the Gordon F. Derner School of Psychology.

===Adelphi University===
In 1963, the New York State Board of Regents granted the college university status, and the name was changed to Adelphi University. In 1964, the School of Business was founded. In 1966, the Institute for Advanced Psychological Studies was founded. In 1973, the university established ABLE (Adult Baccalaureate Learning Experience) for the education of adults. Now known as the College of Professional and Continuing Studies, it was one of the earliest programs created for nontraditional students. In 1984, the Institute for Teaching and Educational Studies was founded; it became the School of Education in 1990. In 1993, the Society of Mentors was established, giving students faculty advisors that they could consult on an as-needed basis to assist them in their studies. In 1995, the Honors College was founded.

In January 1963, Adelphi Suffolk College (which had started out in 1955 offering extension courses in Suffolk County, New York) purchased the former W.K. Vanderbilt estate in Oakdale, New York. In 1968, it was spun off to Dowling College after its chief benefactor, Robert Dowling.

Adelphi faced a serious scandal in 1996, as the school celebrated its 100th anniversary. University president Peter Diamandopoulos and the board of trustees were accused of neglect of duty, misconduct and failure to carry out the educational purposes of Adelphi. The New York State Board of Regents was called in to investigate; Diamandopoulos, along with all but one of the board of trustees, was dismissed from office. The university was in dire financial straits until Robert A. Scott was installed in the position of President in 2000. Scott saved the school by decreasing tuition, increasing scholarships offered for the students, and launching an advertising campaign to increase enrollment. Since that time, the school has surpassed many of its previous gains, and is said to be undergoing a new renaissance. Adelphi University has been ranked as a &quot;Best Buy&quot; college by the Fiske Guide to Colleges for the last ten years for its quality education offered at a comparatively affordable price. Adelphi University also participates in the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities&#x27;s (NAICU) University and College Accountability Network (U-CAN). In 2023, the Princeton Review ranked Adelphi University a &quot;Green College&quot; making the list of environmentally responsible colleges and universities across the country.

In August 2023, Adelphi relocated the Manhattan Center location to Downtown Brooklyn at 179 Livingston Street. Adelphi - Brooklyn Center, located on the 5th through 7th floors, is adjacent to Macy&#x27;s Brooklyn store and shared with St. Francis College. Adelphi has announced their return to Manhattan with a Graduate and Professional Center opening in early 2026. The Adelphi NYC location is under construction within 529 Fifth Avenue at East 44th Street. 

==Breast cancer support program==

The university&#x27;s School of Social Work is home to the Adelphi New York Statewide Breast Cancer Hotline and Support Program The program began in 1980 as the Woman-to-Woman Hotline, a free and confidential service to help women with breast cancer. It is the second oldest breast cancer hotline in the United States; over 100 trained volunteers offer information and emotional support for people with breast cancer. There are professional social workers, bilingual Spanish-speaking staff and support staff, along with support groups, educational programs and individual counseling.

<doc id="675895" wikidata="Q3032560" url="?curid=675895" title="Dime (Canadian coin)">
<text>In Canada, a dime is a coin worth ten cents. It has been the physically smallest Canadian coin since 1922; it is smaller even than the country&#x27;s penny, despite its higher face value. According to the Royal Canadian Mint, the official national term of the coin is the &quot;10-cent piece&quot;, but in practice, the term &quot;dime&quot; predominates in English-speaking Canada. It is nearly identical in size to the American dime. Unlike its American counterpart, the Canadian dime is magnetic due to a distinct metal composition. From 1968 to 2000, it was composed entirely of nickel, and since 2001, it has consisted of a steel core with plating composed of layers of nickel and copper.

The most prevalent version of the coin features a portrait of Elizabeth II on the obverse, although a new version featuring Charles III was introduced in 2023. The reverse contains a representation of the &quot;Bluenose&quot;, a famous Canadian schooner. According to the Royal Canadian Mint, &quot;Artist Emanuel Hahn developed his design for the 10-cent coin from photos of the famous Bluenose schooner.&quot; The coin is produced by the Royal Canadian Mint at its facility in Winnipeg.

The word &quot;dime&quot; comes from the French word &quot;dîme&quot;, meaning &quot;tithe&quot; or &quot;tenth part&quot;, from the Latin &quot;decima [pars]&quot;.

==Collecting==
* 1936 dot: Extremely rare with only 5 known. There are 3 in private collections, one graded Specimen-63 and 2 examples graded SP-68. The other 2 are in the Ottawa currency museum. The most recent of these to sell at auction was one of the SP68 coins, which brought US$184,000 in a Heritage Auction in January 2010.
* 1969 large date: Fewer than 20 examples of the large date variety exist. High-grade versions of this coin sell for $15,000 to $30,000. There is only one graded in mint state as of 2012.
*1999p: The first Canadian 10-cent coin issued with the new plating &quot;P&quot; process. Plated coins are marked with a small &quot;P&quot; beneath the Queen&#x27;s effigy on the obverse of the coin. Mintage is limited to 20,000 coins.
* 2000p: The 2000p Canada dime is scarce with fewer than 250 examples minted. The 2000p dime was lent to the vending industry by the Royal Canadian Mint to test the compatibility of the new plating process of circulation coins with existing vending machines and parking meters. Under contractual obligation, these coins were to be returned to the mint once the compatibility tests were complete. Of the approximately 250 coins minted, many were not returned to the mint, leading to significant debate surrounding the legality of owning these coins. High-grade examples of the 2000p 10-cent issue range from $1,500 to $3,000 CDN. Unlike the 5-cent 2000p issues, the 10-cent coin was not officially released by the mint, and entered the numismatic market illegally.

<text>Women&#x27;s colleges in higher education are undergraduate, bachelor&#x27;s degree-granting institutions, often liberal arts colleges, whose student populations are composed exclusively or almost exclusively of women. Some women&#x27;s colleges admit male students to their graduate schools or in smaller numbers to undergraduate programs, but all serve a primarily female student body.

==Distinction from finishing school==
A women&#x27;s college offers an academic curriculum exclusively or primarily, while a girls&#x27; or women&#x27;s finishing school (sometimes called a charm school) focuses on social graces such as deportment, etiquette, and entertaining; academics if offered are secondary.

The term &quot;finishing school&quot; has sometimes been used or misused to describe certain women&#x27;s colleges. Some of these colleges may have started as finishing schools but transformed themselves into rigorous liberal arts academic institutions, as for instance the now defunct Finch College. Likewise the secondary school Miss Porter&#x27;s School was founded as Miss Porter&#x27;s Finishing School for Young Ladies in 1843; now it emphasizes an academic curriculum.

A women&#x27;s college that had never described itself as a finishing school can acquire the misnomer. Throughout the 114-year history of the women&#x27;s college Sweet Briar, students and alumnae have objected to calling it a finishing school. Nonetheless the finishing school characterization persisted, and may have contributed to declining enrollment, financial straits, and the school&#x27;s near closure in 2015.

==Declining number==
The continuing relevance of women&#x27;s colleges has been questioned. While during the 1960s there were 240 women&#x27;s colleges in the U.S., only about 40 remain as of 2015. In the words of a teacher at Radcliffe (a women&#x27;s college that merged with Harvard): &quot;[i]f women’s colleges become unnecessary, if women’s colleges become irrelevant, then that’s a sign of our [women&#x27;s] success.&quot;

Mary Astell advocated the idea that women were just as rational as men, and just as deserving of education. First published in 1694, her &quot;Serious Proposal to the Ladies for the Advancement of their True and Greatest Interest&quot; presents a plan for an all-female college where women could pursue a life of the mind. The first college to partially realise Astell&#x27;s plan was Whitelands College, a women&#x27;s teacher training college opened in 1841 by the Church of England&#x27;s National Society and since 2004 part of the University of Roehampton. Whitelands was followed by two colleges in London, Queen&#x27;s College in 1848 and Bedford College in 1849. Queen&#x27;s College developed into a girls&#x27; public school and Bedford College became part of the University of London before merging with another women&#x27;s college. The first of the Cambridge women&#x27;s colleges, Girton, which opened in 1869 initially in Hitchin, claims to be the first residential college in Britain to offer degree level education to women. Somerville and Lady Margaret Hall in Oxford opened in 1879.

Existing women&#x27;s colleges:

* Murray Edwards College, Cambridge (established 1954, formerly New Hall)
* Newnham College, Cambridge (established 1871)

===Early history===

Women&#x27;s colleges in the United States were a product of the increasingly popular private girls&#x27; secondary schools of the early- to mid-19th century, called &quot;academies&quot; or &quot;seminaries.&quot; According to Irene Harwarth, et al., &quot;women&#x27;s colleges were founded during the mid- and late-19th century in response to a need for advanced education for women at a time when they were not admitted to most institutions of higher education.&quot; While there were a few coeducational colleges (such as Oberlin College founded in 1833, Lawrence University in 1847, Antioch College in 1853, and Bates College in 1855), most colleges and universities of high standing at that time were exclusively for men.

Critics of the girls’ seminaries were roughly divided into two groups. The reform group, including Emma Willard, felt seminaries required reform through “strengthening teaching of the core academic subjects.” Others felt seminaries were insufficient, suggesting “a more durable institution--a women’s college--be founded, among them, Catharine E. Beecher. In her &quot;True Remedy for the Wrongs of Women&quot; (1851), Beecher points out how “seminaries could not offer sufficient, permanent endowments, buildings, and libraries; a corporation whose duty it is to perpetuate the institution on a given plan.”

Another notable figure was Mary Lyon (1797-1849), founder of Mount Holyoke College, whose contemporaries included Sarah Pierce (Litchfield Female Academy, 1792); Catharine Beecher (Hartford Female Seminary, 1823); Zilpah P. Grant Banister (Ipswich Female Seminary, 1828); George Washington Doane (St. Mary&#x27;s Hall, 1837 now called Doane Academy). Prior to founding Mount Holyoke, Lyon contributed to the development of both Hartford Female Seminary and Ipswich Female Seminary. She was also involved in the creation of &quot;Wheaton Female Seminary&quot; (now Wheaton College, Massachusetts) in 1834.

===Women&#x27;s College Coalition===
The Women&#x27;s College Coalition is an association of women&#x27;s colleges and universities (with some observers/participants from the single-sex secondary/high schools) that are either two- and four-year, both public and private, religiously-affiliated and secular. It was founded in 1972, at a time in which the &quot;Civil Rights Movement&quot;, the &quot;Women&#x27;s Rights Movement&quot;, and Title IX, as well as demographic and technological changes in the 1960s brought about rapid and complex social and economic change in the United States. These societal changes put increasing pressure of perceived &quot;unpopularity&quot; and &quot;old fashioned&quot; perceptions and opinions placing the concept of &quot;single-sex education&quot; for both women and men on the most drastic downward spiral in its history. Additionally, the landscape of education dramatically changed as many previously all-male high schools (both private/independent and public) along with the colleges, many of which were either forced by official actions or declining attendance figures to become coeducational, thereby offering women many more educational options. At the same time with the similar changes forced on women&#x27;s institutions, both private and public secondary schools along with the colleges/universities, forced a number of the larger number of girls schools to also coeducate. By the late 1970s, women&#x27;s enrollment in college exceeded the men&#x27;s and, in the 2020s, women make up the majority of undergraduates (57% nationally) on college/university campuses. Women earn better college grades than men do, and are more likely than men to complete college.

During the past several decades, the Women&#x27;s College Coalition engaged in research about the benefits of a women&#x27;s high school and/or college education in the 21st century. Drawing upon the findings of research conducted by the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) and Hardwick-Day on levels of satisfaction among students and alumnae at women&#x27;s colleges and coeducational institutions, as well as the Association of American Colleges and Universities, NAICU and others, the Coalition makes the case for women&#x27;s education and women&#x27;s high schools and colleges to prospective students, families, policy and opinion makers, the media, employers and the general public.

<text>The Law of Success is a book written by Napoleon Hill in 1925. It was originally released as a set of 15 separate booklets before being consolidated into a single-tome book. The Law of Success in 16 Lessons is an edited version of Napoleon Hill’s first manuscript, which was reworked under the advisement of several contributors. This version was initially published in 1928 as a multi-volume correspondence course. Later editions consolidated the material into a single book.

== Contents ==
Hill frequently refers to &#x27;The Temple of Success,&#x27; and cites the laws and their collective understanding to be the door to the Temple of Success. It is the author&#x27;s stance that thinking is the most organized form of energy. The 16 lessons include The Law of the Mastermind, A Definite Chief Aim, Self-Confidence, Habit of Saving, Initiative and Leadership, Imagination, Enthusiasm, Self-Control, Doing More than Paid For, A Pleasing Personality, Accurate Thinking, Concentration, Cooperation, Profiting by Failure, Tolerance, and The Golden Rule.

==History==

According to Hill, the work was commissioned at the request of Andrew Carnegie, at the conclusion of a multi-day interview with Hill. It was allegedly based upon interviews with over 100 American millionaires, including self-made industrial giants such as Henry Ford, J. P. Morgan, John D. Rockefeller, Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Edison, across nearly 20 years. &quot;The Law of Success&quot; was first presented as a lecture, and was delivered by its author in many major cities and in many smaller localities throughout the United States over a period of more than seven years. One set of manuscripts Hill had set in leather covers and the pages embossed with gold.

== Publication ==
According to authors Michael J. Ritt Jr. and Kirk Landers, publishers were &quot;aghast at the financial risks&quot; involved in publishing the work, due to its extensive length and Hill&#x27;s lack of experience in the book publishing business. It was originally released as a set of 15 separate booklets before being consolidated into a single-tome book. There were 118 limited edition copies, which were given to many of America&#x27;s most successful individuals, all of whom had contributed to the content of the book. Orne Publishing used one of these original copies to create a reprinted version of &quot;The Law of Success&quot; in 2010.

&quot;The Law of Success in 16 Lessons&quot; is an edited version of Napoleon Hill’s first manuscript, which was reworked under the advisement of several contributors. This version was initially published in 1928 as an eight volume series. Later editions consolidated the material into a single hardcover book. It was republished by Penguin Books in 2009 as a single paperback edition.

== Reception ==
Reviewing an audiobook version, &quot;California Bookwatch&quot; stated that &quot;Joel Fotinos provides a clear and solid reading of the fifteen principles to winning, written by a motivational leader who builds a lesson plan for achievement&quot;, praising the book as &quot;an outstanding work stimulating the mind and offering a path for achievement for all kinds of people&quot;. &quot;Library Journal&quot; said, reviewing the book in 2008, that the work &quot;may be as useful now as it was 80 years ago&quot;, but that the newer edition did not contextualize the dated mindset of the book. They described the work as a &quot;fascinating amalgam of what has since become familiar [...] and what has not&quot;. 

In a biography of Hill in 1995, Michael J. Ritt Jr. and Kirk Landers described the work as &quot;a flawed, rambling, sometimes incomprehensible document that a skilled text editor with a strong sense of book market imperatives might have condensed to a slick, fast-reading, fifty-page chapter&quot;, but that &quot;reduced to safe, conventional publishing practices. &quot;Law of Success&quot; would most likely have been a very ordinary book with a very temporary life. Its imperfect, unvarnished defiance of convention was part of its raw power and freshness.&quot;

<doc id="675921" wikidata="Q1753290" url="?curid=675921" title="Leftöver Crack">
<text>Leftöver Crack is an American punk rock band formed in 1998, following the breakup of Choking Victim. The band is currently signed to Tankcrimes for CD releases, and Alternative Tentacles for vinyl releases. Leftöver Crack spans several different music genres including hardcore punk, ska, and crust punk. They write mostly political lyrics of a radical leftist nature, opposing religion, capitalism, and authority. Members of Leftöver Crack reside in the C-Squat on 155 Avenue C in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Natives of New York City, band members have a well-documented history of back-and-forth conflict with the NYPD which precedes the band&#x27;s formation. The name &quot;Leftöver Crack&quot; is explained by Stza as being &quot;an oxymoron&quot;, based on the idea that crack cocaine addicts are known for vigorous use and are unlikely to have any &quot;leftover&quot; crack.

== History ==
=== 1998-2000: Beginnings ===
Formed around the same time as the breakup of Choking Victim, Leftöver Crack was initially an outlet for Choking Victim frontman Scott Sturgeon a.k.a. Stza to release songs that, for one reason or another, were never recorded by Choking Victim and which he claims are the &quot;Leftover songs&quot;—hence the name. For almost two years following the band&#x27;s formation, the band consisted almost solely of Stza, who recorded many of the songs that would feature on later releases onto a four-track recorder whilst searching for band members. The band eventually solidified (albeit temporarily) around a lineup of Scott &quot;Stza&quot; Sturgeon (vocals, additional guitars), Brad Logan of F-Minus (guitar), Alec Baillie (bass, previously of Choking Victim), Mike Trujillo of Blindsided (guitar) and Amery &quot;AWOL&quot; Smith (drums, previously of Suicidal Tendencies and the Beastie Boys).

Now a complete band, Leftöver Crack proceeded to record several songs with the full lineup, including &quot;Rock the 40 Oz.&quot;, &quot;Crack City Rockers&quot; and &quot;The Good, the Bad &amp; the Leftöver Crack&quot;—effectively the band&#x27;s &quot;theme song&quot;. Five of these songs were later included on the band&#x27;s first release, &quot;Rock the 40 Oz.&quot; 7-inch EP, which was released by Bankshot! Records on March 8, 2000.

=== 2001: Signing to Hellcat Records ===
After contributing the song &quot;Crack City Rockers&quot; to the second installment of Hellcat Records&#x27; &quot;Give &#x27;em the Boot&quot; compilation series, the band was signed to the label, initially being contracted to produce three albums for Hellcat. The band agreed, and promptly began recording songs for their first full-length album, tentatively titled &quot;Shoot the Kids at School&quot;.

Hellcat Records refused to release the album, due to concerns over the album&#x27;s controversial title, artwork, and subject matter (especially regarding the recent Columbine shootings). The band eventually relented and changed the album&#x27;s title, art, and track listing, under the promise that they would be released from their contract afterward as a result. The album was eventually released under the title of &quot;Mediocre Generica&quot;, a sly attack at Hellcat Records, who Stza claimed wanted a &quot;mediocre, generic&quot; album compared the original. The album was released on September 11, 2001.

At this point, the band now consisted of Stza (vocals, additional guitars), Alec (bass), Ezra, and Ara Babajian from NYC ska band Agent 99, and later The Slackers, on drums.

=== 2002-2003: Split from Hellcat Records and new music ===
As a result of legal disputes with Hellcat Records, the band was effectively left in limbo for approximately two years, unable to leave their current label, yet also unable to sign to another—as well as being unable to release any new material under the name of Leftöver Crack. However, the band did manage to bend the rules of their contract slightly, releasing a split EP with F-Minus as the Crack Rock Steady Seven—effectively Leftöver Crack working under aliases with additional musicians. The EP was titled &quot;Baby Jesus, Sliced up in the Manger&quot; and was released on November 27, 2003.

In February 2003, the band began to record the songs that they had written and developed over the last three years with esteemed engineer Steve Albini, a majority of which would see a release on their second album. After recording two final songs that winter, and having finally been dropped from Hellcat Records&#x27; roster, the band opted to release the song the following the year as the &quot;Fuck World Trade&quot; demo for the consideration of independent punk record labels. Around the same time, the band were approached by renowned underground punk rock figure and ex-Dead Kennedys frontman Jello Biafra, and consequently signed to his Alternative Tentacles record label.

=== 2004-2006: &quot;Fuck World Trade&quot; and hiatus ===
On August 30, 2004, Leftöver Crack released their second album, &quot;Fuck World Trade&quot;, on Alternative Tentacles (Household Name Records in the UK).

The album was banned in multiple chain stores such as Wal-Mart, Best Buy and Music Land due to the album&#x27;s controversial name and subject matter—as well as the front cover, which features George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and Rudy Giuliani (Tony Blair on the UK release) causing the World Trade Center attacks.

The album also displayed a greater degree of artistic freedom from the band, featuring longer songs, a wider range of instrumentation (such as strings, synthesizers and double-bass drumming) and a larger amount of genre experimentation—featuring elements of death metal, classical music and folk music along with the band&#x27;s trademark combination of anarcho-punk and ska. The album also included several guest appearances, including Chris Head, Justin Sane, and Chris No. 2 of Anti-Flag, as well as a collaboration with The World/Inferno Friendship Society.

The band took an indefinite hiatus after the death of drummer Brandon Possible at the end of 2004. Stza spent the interim playing Leftöver Crack and Choking Victims songs by himself at a few solo acoustic shows. Ezra spent time writing songs for his band Morning Glory. Leftöver Crack began touring again in the summer of 2005, including some dates with Citizen Fish and The World/Inferno Friendship Society, as well as playing dates in October 2005 in California after the Wasted Fest was canceled. The so-called Crack Rock Steady Seven also embarked on a small European tour in November; however, this incarnation consisted of only Stza and The Infested, in some cases billed as the &quot;Crack Steady Rockers&quot;.

=== 2006-2007: Return and split with Citizen Fish ===
Blacknoise Records released a four-way split entitled &quot;The Kids Are Gonna Pay...&quot; in March 2006 with Leftöver Crack contributing 1 new song, &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking Now&quot;. Other bands on the split included Morning Glory, F-Minus, and Bent Outta Shape. The 7-inch was limited to 1000 copies on white vinyl and is now sold out. The first 100 included limited-edition patches designed by Brad Logan&#x27;s wife Kristen, and some included an insert.

On October 31, 2006, Fat Wreck Chords released a 7-inch split single with UK ska punk band Citizen Fish, to which Leftöver Crack contributed the new song &quot;Baby Punchers&quot;. To support the release, the two bands joined with other Fat Wreck bands, The Sainte Catherines and Dead to Me, and went on a U.S. tour. The full-length split with Citizen Fish, entitled &quot;Deadline&quot;, was released on March 6, 2007, with Fat Wreck Chords releasing the CD version and Alternative Tentacles releasing the vinyl version. The album featured seven songs from each band (plus an intro for Leftöver Crack&#x27;s side), as well as featuring three songs originally intended to be released by Stza&#x27;s newer band, Star Fucking Hipsters. 1103 copies were released on white vinyl.

=== 2007-2011: Departure of Ezra and tour of Australia ===
Following the release and subsequent touring in support of &quot;Deadline&quot;, Leftöver Crack gradually became less prominent as members (namely Stza and Ezra) focused on other musical projects—such as Star Fucking Hipsters and Morning Glory, respectively. Although still regularly playing shows, the band effectively took a backseat, especially as Star Fucking Hipsters released their first two albums, &quot;Until We&#x27;re Dead&quot; and &quot;Never Rest in Peace&quot;.

Towards the end of 2009, it was announced that longtime guitarist and backing vocalist Ezra had left the band. Although initially appearing to be an amicable departure, this later escalated when Stza effectively began an online &quot;feud&quot; with Ezra, accusing him of being a liar and drug addict.

In November 2009, Leftöver Crack toured Australia and New Zealand for the first time in their career. However, the lineup for all of the shows consisted of Stza, guitarist Frank Piegaro (of Star Fucking Hipsters/Degenerics) and two Australians filling in: Alex Flamsteed (Hereafter) and Chris Cox (Phalanx).

Following the Australian tour, Stza stated at a house show in West Auckland that Leftöver Crack would most probably be inactive in the future, much like Choking Victim before them. This coincided with the increased rate of activity from Star Fucking Hipsters, which has become his main creative outlet as of late.

In December 2010, Leftöver Crack announced that they were playing three shows. Returning to the lineup was Ezra, implying that the feud between him and Stza may have been resolved.

In January 2011, it was announced through their Facebook page that Leftöver Crack would do a West Coast tour in February and an East Coast tour in March of that year. They would also play a small UK tour in August 2011, including the Reading and Leeds festivals.

=== 2015-2016: &quot;Constructs of the State&quot; ===

On July 20, 2015, Scott Sturgeon confirmed Leftöver Crack had finished their third album, &quot;Constructs of the State&quot;. It was released on November 27, 2015, through Fat Wreck Chords, and featured guest appearances from Days N&#x27; Daze, Mischief Brew, The Bouncing Souls, Intro5pect, Blackbird Raum, Penny Rimbaud and Jesse Michaels.

On May 25, 2016, the band released a music video for the song &quot;Bedbugs &amp; Beyond&quot; courtesy of Shibby Pictures.

=== 2021: Change of record label, move to Tankcrimes ===
It was announced in September 2021 that all Star Fucking Hipsters and Leftöver Crack discography would move from Fat Wreck to Oakland-based record label Tankcrimes. Tankcrimes is a small independent label with bands such as Spazz, Ghoul, Necrot, and punk supergroup Kicker. It is unclear if &quot;Never Rest in Peace&quot; from Star Fucking Hipsters (which was originally released via Alternative Tentacles) or &quot;Mediocre Generica&quot; (originally released on Hellcat) would also shift to the Oakland-based record label

=== 2024: &quot;Abandon The Precincts&quot; ===
On March 6, 2024, the band released &quot;Shootacide&quot; and announced the release of a new album titled &quot;Abandon The Precincts&quot;, as well as an upcoming tour.

== Venue bans, criminal records and visa restriction ==
Leftöver Crack has been banned from performing in many venues in New York City, such as ABC No Rio and the Knitting Factory. However, they still play at banned venues under a different name, Crack Rock Steady Seven or individually as solo acts. They regularly have trouble touring in certain countries, especially Canada, due to members having prior criminal records. They were denied entry into Canada for a tour scheduled at the end of 2007. 

During a show in Boston, in August 2008, Stza angrily stated Leftöver Crack would never return to Boston; however, they played just outside of Boston on June 18, 2016. In 2006, after their show in Boise, Stza announced to a group of fans that they would never return, and Boise was subsequently skipped in &#x27;07 and Star Fucking Hipsters&#x27; 2010 Boise date was canceled a week or so after being posted, though they returned to Boise in March 2011. In June 2016, Leftöver Crack was allowed entry into Canada and played Amnesia Rockfest in Montebello, Quebec, but many members were denied again in 2018.

<text>Sir Edward John Poynter, 1st Baronet (20 March 183626 July 1919) was an English painter, designer, and draughtsman, who served as President of the Royal Academy.

==Life==
Poynter was the son of architect Ambrose Poynter. He was born in Paris, France, though his parents returned to Britain soon after his birth. He was educated at Brighton College and Ipswich School, but left school early for reasons of ill health, spending winters in Madeira and Rome. In 1853, he met Frederick Leighton in Rome, who made a great impression on the 17-year-old Poynter. On his return to London he studied at Leigh&#x27;s Academy in Newman Street and the Royal Academy Schools, before going to Paris to study in the studio of the classicist painter Charles Gleyre where James McNeill Whistler and George du Maurier were fellow-students.

In 1866 Poynter married the famous beauty Agnes MacDonald, daughter of the Rev. G. B. MacDonald of Wolverhampton, and they had three children. Her sister Georgiana married the artist Edward Burne-Jones; her sister Alice was the mother of writer Rudyard Kipling; and her sister Louisa was the mother of three-times Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Stanley Baldwin.

Poynter&#x27;s sister Clara Bell became a noted translator of literary and scientific works.

==Career==

He became best known for his large historical paintings such as &quot;Israel in Egypt&quot; (1867; Guildhall Art Gallery, London), followed by &quot;St George for England&quot; (1869), a mosaic for the Central Lobby of the Palace of Westminster, depicting St George and the Dragon and perhaps culminating with &quot;The visit of the Queen of Sheba to King Solomon&quot; (1884–90; Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney). He was admitted as an associate of the Royal Academy in 1869.

Poynter held a number of official posts: he was the first Slade Professor at University College London from 1871 to 1875, principal of the National Art Training School from 1875 to 1881 and director of the National Gallery from 1894 to 1904 (overseeing the opening of the Tate Gallery). He became a full Royal Academician in 1876. In 1896, on the death of Sir John Millais, Poynter was elected President of the Academy. He received a knighthood in the same year and an honorary degree from Cambridge University in 1898. It was announced that he would receive a baronetcy in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902 for the (subsequently postponed) coronation of King Edward VII, and on 24 July 1902 he was created a Baronet, of Albert Gate, in the city of Westminster, in the county of London.

Poynter&#x27;s old school, Brighton College, held an exhibition of Poynter&#x27;s paintings and drawings entitled &quot;Life at Arms Length&quot; in its Burstow Gallery in November–December 1995.

<doc id="675927" wikidata="Q5928989" url="?curid=675927" title="Hudson Valley Community College">
<text>Hudson Valley Community College is a public community college in Troy, New York. It is part of the State University of New York (SUNY). Although about eighty percent of the students are from the Capital District, the remainder are from other parts of New York, other states and from some 30 countries around the world.
The college is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education and is overseen by a 10-member Board of Trustees. 
The school has an enrollment of 9,300 students.

==History==

The roots of HVCC are in the Veteran&#x27;s Vocational School in downtown Troy, set up in 1946 to provide high school level instruction to returning veterans of World War II. In order to provide college-level instruction to veterans among others, the college was founded in 1953 as the Hudson Valley Technical Institute, providing five vocational training programs. Dwight Marvin, editor of the &quot;Troy Record&quot;, was one of several community leaders who pressed to create a broader mission for the college, which in 1959 changed its name to Hudson Valley Community College. Marvin served as the first chairman of the college&#x27;s Board of Trustees.

By 1955, the board of trustees was already looking for a larger location to site a campus. The trustees surveyed likely sites for a new campus.

The new campus was initially opposed by a group of Rensselaer County taxpayers, who argued that the county should not have to pay for half the cost of the campus construction if fewer than half the students were county residents. What would become a landmark case for community colleges in New York State eventually was heard by the state&#x27;s Court of Appeals. On June 25, 1958, the court upheld the county&#x27;s right to fund half of the cost of construction and paved the way for capital construction at community colleges around the state. The new campus, with five Indiana limestone buildings, was completed in 1961 and the former factory building was abandoned and eventually torn down.
===Growth in the 21st century===
A $47.4 million, 100,000-square-foot science center on campus was completed in the fall of 2013. The building houses laboratory and classroom space for the college&#x27;s science programs and support degree offerings in biological sciences, biotechnology, physical science and environmental science. Equipment and processes available to students include high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy; confocal microscopes; flow cytometers and sorters, advanced digital microscopy; DNA sequencers; real-time PCR detection systems; and automated protein/RNA electrophoresis.

In fall 2019, the college opened the $14.5 million, 37,000 square foot Gene F. Haas Center for Advanced Manufacturing Skills. The center will allow the college to grow enrollment in its Advanced Manufacturing Technology degree program and meet an urgent workforce demand for skilled employees in the region.

===College presidents===
The college has had eight presidents:
*Otto V. Guenther, 19531965: Otto Guenther was selected in 1953 to be the first president of the newly established Hudson Valley Technical Institute. In 1957, Guenther received approval from the Rensselaer County Board of Supervisors to begin construction of a new campus on the border of Troy and the town of North Greenbush. That transition to a newly created suburban campus and the growth of the student body were Guenther&#x27;s legacy as president.
*James J. Fitzgibbons, 19651979: James Fitzgibbons presided over growth in the college&#x27;s student body and in the number of academic programs offered. During his tenure, Hudson Valley&#x27;s curricula grew from 18 to 38 academic programs. Five new buildings on campus also were completed during the Fitzgibbons presidency. The Fitzgibbons Health Technologies Center was dedicated to the president in 1982.
*Joseph J. Bulmer, 19791996: The longest-tenured president of the college, Joseph J. Bulmer served Hudson Valley for 17 years. A nuclear engineer with a distinguished career at General Electric, Bulmer was responsible for increasing the college&#x27;s image in the Capital Region. The establishment of distance learning, a Center for Effective Teaching, expanded services for disabled students and the addition of the McDonough Sports Complex, Cogan Hall, Fitzgibbons Health Technologies Center, the Hy Rosenblum Administration Center and the Bulmer Telecommunications Center were accomplished during Bulmer&#x27;s presidency.
*Stephen M. Curtis, 19961998: Stephen Curtis came to Hudson Valley Community College after serving as interim president of Borough of Manhattan Community College. While at Hudson Valley, he led improvements to the college&#x27;s distance learning program and helped link the college to several high schools around the region through interactive television. 
*John L. Buono, 19982003: The only alumnus to serve as president of Hudson Valley Community College, John Buono had a lengthy career in public service before accepting the offer to serve as interim president of his alma mater. Buono served as Rensselaer County Executive from 1986 to 1995 and was then tapped by Governor George Pataki to head the New York State Dormitory Authority, where he served as director for three years. Buono&#x27;s tenure as president of the college saw the creation of the Viking Child Care Center, Guenther Enrollment Services Center and the Joseph L. Bruno Stadium. He also established the college&#x27;s Workforce Development Institute, which provides non-credit, customized training for business and industry. 
*Marco J. Silvestri, Interim President, 20042005: Before serving as interim president, Silvestri served as the college&#x27;s vice president for administration since 1984. During his tenure, the college received reaffirmation of its accreditation by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Universities.
*Andrew J. Matonak, 20052018: &quot;Drew&quot; Matonak assumed the presidency on April 18, 2005. Before arriving at Hudson Valley, he served as president of Northwest Iowa Community College in Sheldon, Iowa, for three years. During his 13-year tenure, Matonak led the college through successive years of enrollment growth as well as numerous improvements to the college infrastructure, including the Administration Building, the TEC-SMART facility in Malta, the Science Center, the Gene F. Haas Center for Advanced Manufacturing Skills, and the Outdoor Athletic Complex.
*Roger A. Ramsammy, 2018June 25, 2024: Ramsammy assumed the presidency in July 2018 after previously serving as president of Miami Dade&#x27;s West Campus and Northern Virginia Community College. Dr. Ramsammy previously served as a faculty member, department chair and dean at Palm Beach Community College. In August 2022, Ramsammy came under fire for his announcement that HVCC would not comply with a SUNY system-wide mandate that incoming students be vaccinated for COVID-19. The system has demanded an explanation for this announcement and the HVCC Faculty Association has filed a formal grievance against the college. Ramsammy was terminated on June 25, 2024 for sexual harassment. Louis Coplin, who recently retired as vice president of student affairs, was named by the board as interim president.

==Academics==
The college offers more than 80 academic degree and certificate programs (more than 20 online) in three academic schools:

* School of Business and Liberal Arts
* School of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math
* School of Health Sciences

Some of the college&#x27;s most popular academic programs include Criminal Justice, Business, Liberal Arts, Electrical Construction and Maintenance, Nursing, Computer Information Systems, Human Services and Engineering Science. Hudson Valley also offers dozens of college-level courses for the region&#x27;s secondary students each year through its College in the High School program.

Transfer agreements with more than 100 four-year colleges and universities have been created and maintained so that students have a variety of opportunities once they complete their associate degree at the college. The most popular transfer destinations for graduates are University at Albany, Siena College, The College of Saint Rose and the Sage Colleges.

The college also collaborates with four-year institutions of higher education to host bachelor&#x27;s degree programs directly on the Troy campus. These include a B.B.A. Business Administration degree from the State University of New York at Cobleskill.

The college oversees the Capital District Educational Opportunity Center, which provides college preparation and career training for those who are income-eligible.
The Marvin Library Learning Commons supports the college&#x27;s academic programs through its collections and services. The library provides over 100,000 volumes in print, microform, and electronic format. It provides access to over 30,000 journal titles through a range of print and electronic journals. Research databases are available to all registered students and faculty and staff from the library and from off-campus. Faculty librarians are available to provide reference services and individual research consultation by appointment. The library sponsors the Voices lecture series with over a dozen speakers on topics from the arts, politics and contemporary issues in the community. The college&#x27;s archives are stored in and maintained by the library.

== Student Senate ==
The Student Senate, elected from within the student body, is the elected student government on the campus. The Student Senate at Hudson Valley Community College, with administration and faculty guidance, assumes the responsibility of promoting and coordinating student affairs and student life, authorizing the establishment of new clubs and activities, promoting student welfare and assisting with the annual budget which supports the extracurricular program of over forty-five different activities.

==Athletics==
The college currently offers intercollegiate sports for men and women. Teams compete in Region III of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) and in the Mountain Valley Athletic Conference. The school was one of the inaugural members of the NJCAAE, the only national esports association exclusively for two-year colleges.

The Outdoor Athletic Complex, which includes a turf field for soccer, lacrosse and football as well as an eight-lane track, was completed in 2016. The facility hosted track and field and tennis competitions for the New York State Special Olympics in 2017 and 2018.

The college&#x27;s teams have won national championships in ice hockey (2001), men&#x27;s cross country (1996), women&#x27;s bowling (1995, 2010), women&#x27;s basketball (1993) and women&#x27;s alpine skiing (1977).
==Culture at Hudson Valley Community College==
Maureen Stapleton Theatre – The Maureen Stapleton Theatre, dedicated in 1981, seats 350 people and is located at the north end of the Siek Campus Center. The space was named after the Academy Award-winning actress who was a native of Troy, New York.

Sculpture on campus – Two pieces by noted American sculptor Antoni Milkowski are sited on the campus. The college obtained &quot;Runner&quot;, which consists of a series of seven shiny stainless steel cubes, in 2009, as a gift from the Milkowski family. It is located in a new quad near the entrance to Administration/Classroom Building. &quot;1971 AD&quot;, has been on view in front of the Siek Campus Center since the college&#x27;s 25th anniversary. The large, cor-ten steel sphere was a gift from the artist who lived and maintained a studio for many years in New Lebanon, New York.
Teaching Gallery – The college&#x27;s teaching gallery is located in the Administration/Classroom Building. The gallery displays exhibits by regional and national artists each year as well as student exhibitions.

==Off-campus sites==

Troy Educational Opportunity Center – Hudson Valley Community College operates an extension center at 431 River Street in Troy. The extension center, now named the Troy Educational Opportunity Center, has served as the Troy location of the Capital District Educational Opportunity Center (EOC) while the Albany location is closed. Hudson Valley, which administers the EOC, also now offers credit-bearing college courses, along with credit-free career training through its Office of Workforce Development at the site.

TEC-SMART (Training and Education Center for Semiconductor Manufacturing and Alternative and Renewable Technologies) – Opened in January 2010, the TEC-SMART facility is a joint initiative between the college and NYSERDA (New York State Energy Research and Development Authority). Located in Malta, New York’s Saratoga Technology and Energy Park, the building houses the college&#x27;s training classrooms in semiconductor manufacturing technology, as well as labs and classrooms for training in renewable energy technologies such as solar and wind power.

<doc id="675934" wikidata="Q1514273" url="?curid=675934" title="Spirit Lake (Washington)">
<text>Spirit Lake is a lake in Skamania County, Washington, United States, located north of Mount St. Helens. It was a popular tourist destination for many years until Mount St. Helens erupted in 1980. Previously there had been six camps on the shore of Spirit Lake: Boy Scout (Camp Spirit Lake), the Girl Scout Camp at Spirit Lake, two YMCA camps (Camp Loowit, and Portland YMCA camp), Harmony Fall Lodge, and another for the general public. There were also several lodges accessible to visitors, including Spirit Lake Lodge and Mt. St. Helens Lodge. The latter was owned and operated by Harry R. Truman, a noted victim of the volcano&#x27;s 1980 eruption.

==Human history==
The body of water was named &quot;Spirit&quot; by settlers after histories from Native American people in the area spoke of haunting spirits at the lake. The spirits, telling a story of life and death, formed out of the mists into various shapes of trees and animals, foretelling impending doom but good fortune in the afterlife. Any person who saw the apparitions were dead within a week.

A post office named Spirit Lake existed for a brief time, renamed to &quot;Lange&quot; in 1910 after the postmaster. Early mining around the lake began at the turn of the 20th century and necessitated the first road to the area in 1901, replacing a treacherous trail considered unfit for wagons.

Prior to 1980, Spirit Lake consisted of two arms that occupied what had been the valleys of the North Fork Toutle River and a tributary. About 4,000 years ago, these valleys were blocked by lahars and pyroclastic flow deposits from Mount St. Helens to form the pre-1980 Spirit Lake. The longest branch of Spirit Lake was about long. A stable outlet channel flowed from the lake to the North Fork Toutle River across a natural dam composed of volcanic material. The level of Spirit Lake remained basically stable, at an altitude of about .

== 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption ==
During the May 18, 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, Spirit Lake received the full impact of the lateral blast from the volcano. The blast and the debris avalanche associated with this eruption temporarily displaced much of the lake from its bed and forced lake waters as a wave as much as above lake level on the mountain slopes along the north shoreline of the lake. The debris avalanche deposited about of pyrolized trees, other plant material, volcanic ash, and volcanic debris of various origins into Spirit Lake. The deposition of this volcanic material decreased the lake volume by approximately . 

Lahar and pyroclastic-flow deposits from the eruption blocked its natural pre-eruption outlet to the North Fork Toutle River valley at its outlet, raising the surface elevation of the lake by between and . The surface area of the lake was increased from 1,300 acres to about 2,200 acres and its maximum depth decreased from to . The eruption tore thousands of trees from the surrounding hillsides and swept them into Spirit Lake. These thousands of shattered trees formed a floating log raft on the lake surface that covered about 40% of the lake&#x27;s surface after the eruption.

After the eruption, Spirit Lake contained highly toxic water with volcanic gases seeping up from the lake bed. A month after the eruption, the bacteria-carrying water was devoid of oxygen. Scientists predicted that the lake would not recover quickly, but the reemergence of phytoplankton starting in 1983 began to restore oxygen levels. Amphibians such as frogs and salamanders recolonized the lake, and fish (reintroduced by fishermen) thrived.

==Water levels==

The water level of Spirit Lake is maintained at about by draining water through Spirit Lake Outlet Tunnel, a gravity-feed tunnel completed in 1985. The tunnel was cut through Harrys Ridge to South Coldwater Creek, which flows to Coldwater Lake and into the North Fork of the Toutle River. Had the lake level not been stabilized, the dam, which was composed of volcanic avalanche debris created by the 1980 eruption, would have been breached and caused catastrophic flooding within the Toutle River Valley.

An attempt to upgrade and repair the 1985 tunnel began in 2021 but was halted due to concerns over damages to the pumice plain. The project restarted in 2024 and a temporary road, following the prior access path to the lake, will be rebuilt with future work to involve the installation of gates to the tunnel and dredging to prevent the buildup of logs. During the efforts planned through 2027, several trails surrounding the area will no longer be accessible during weekdays.

==Climate==
Pre-eruption weather data from the Spirit Lake Ranger Station indicates the area either had the rare dry-summer variant of the subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification: Dsc), or the rare cold-summer mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csc), both of which are found only in small areas across the world. Recent climate data for the area is not available to confirm whether the post-eruption site still has either one of these rare climate types.

<text>Matilda is a 1996 American fantasy comedy film co-produced and directed by Danny DeVito from a screenplay by Nicholas Kazan and Robin Swicord, based on the 1988 novel of the same name by Roald Dahl. The film stars Mara Wilson as the title character, with DeVito himself (who also served a dual role as the narrator), Rhea Perlman, Embeth Davidtz, and Pam Ferris in supporting roles. The plot centers on the titular child prodigy who develops psychokinetic abilities and uses them to deal with her disreputable family and the tyrannical principal of her school.

&quot;Matilda&quot; was released in the United States on August 2, 1996, by Sony Pictures Releasing under their TriStar Pictures label. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise being directed towards its faithfulness to the novel and DeVito&#x27;s direction. Despite this, the film was a box office disappointment, grossing $47 million on a $36 million budget, but &quot;Matilda&quot; subsequently attained greater popularity after being released on home video.

==Plot==

Six-year-old Matilda Wormwood is neglected and mistreated by her parents, Harry and Zinnia, who even refuse to enroll her in school, and her older brother, Michael. Smart and independent, Matilda finds solace in books at the local library. After Harry destroys one of Matilda&#x27;s library books and forces her to watch mindless television, Matilda becomes angry, and the television explodes. 

Harry sells a car to Miss Agatha Trunchbull, the tyrannical principal of Crunchem Hall Elementary School, in exchange for admitting Matilda as a student. The other students warn Matilda about Trunchbull&#x27;s abusive disciplinary methods, which include throwing students out the window and locking them in an iron maiden known as the Chokey. Matilda&#x27;s teacher, Miss Jennifer Honey, notices the ease with which Matilda answers middle school multiplication questions and requests Matilda be moved to a higher class, but Miss Trunchbull refuses. The Wormwoods are not interested either. Later, Matilda discovers her father is under surveillance by the FBI over his illegal dealings. Her parents refuse to believe her warning, as Zinnia flirts with the two agents who pose as speedboat salesmen.

Discovering the car from Harry to be faulty, Miss Trunchbull locks Matilda in the Chokey as punishment. Miss Honey rescues Matilda, and Matilda&#x27;s friend Lavender puts a newt in Miss Trunchbull&#x27;s water jug. Miss Trunchbull accuses Matilda, who angrily telekinetically tips the glass over, splashing the newt onto Miss Trunchbull. Matilda is unable to reproduce her powers to Miss Honey during a test. Miss Honey invites Matilda to tea and reveals her past: her mother died when she was two, and her father Magnus invited his wife&#x27;s stepsister, Trunchbull, to live with them and look after her, but Trunchbull abused her. Magnus died, apparently by suicide, when Miss Honey was five and left everything to Miss Trunchbull in his will. Matilda and Miss Honey sneak into Miss Trunchbull&#x27;s house to retrieve some of Miss Honey&#x27;s belongings, but Miss Trunchbull unexpectedly returns and they narrowly escape.

Matilda practices her telekinetic powers and drives away the FBI agents. She returns to Trunchbull&#x27;s house and wreaks havoc while posing as the vengeful spirit of Magnus, but Miss Trunchbull uncovers Matilda&#x27;s ruse upon finding her hair ribbon. The next day, Miss Trunchbull visits Miss Honey&#x27;s class and demands that Matilda confess while threatening to lock her away permanently. Matilda, again posing as Magnus&#x27; ghost, telekinetically writes a message on the blackboard. The message accuses Miss Trunchbull of murdering him and demands that she return Miss Honey&#x27;s house and money and leave town, threatening to murder her as retribution if she does not do so. Miss Trunchbull becomes terrified and attacks the students in a rage, but Matilda protects them and they force Miss Trunchbull out for good.

Miss Honey moves back into her father&#x27;s house. Harry, Zinnia, and Michael come to take Matilda and flee to Guam to avoid the FBI. Matilda refuses to go, saying she would rather stay with Miss Honey. Zinnia expresses remorse at never having understood Matilda, and she and Harry sign the adoption papers. Matilda goes on to live happily with Miss Honey, who becomes principal of Crunchem Hall.

==Production==
In November 1993, Universal Pictures won a screen adaptation of &quot;Matilda&quot; by Roald Dahl, written by writers Nicholas Kazan and Robin Swicord, following a heated bidding war between Universal and Columbia Pictures. Following disagreements between Danny DeVito and Bregman-Baer Productions over budgetary concerns, Universal put &quot;Matilda&quot; into turnaround, with Columbia&#x27;s sister company TriStar Pictures picking up the project.

Miriam Margolyes confirmed that she auditioned for the role of Agatha Trunchbull during a filmed interview with Jo Brand for the UK television special, &quot;Roald Dahl&#x27;s Revolting Rule Book&quot;, which was hosted by Richard E. Grant and aired on September 22, 2007. This documentary commemorated Dahl&#x27;s 90th birthday and also celebrated his impact as a children&#x27;s author in popular culture. Margolyes went on to play Aunt Sponge (another Dahl villainess) as well as the voice of the Glowworm in &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot;, also released in 1996.

DeVito and cinematographer Stefan Czapsky made heavy use of wide-angle lenses and exaggerated perspective, in a manner similar to the films of Terry Gilliam.

Pam Ferris (Miss Trunchbull) incurred several injuries during the production of the film. The climactic scene where she is whacked by blackboard erasers requires her to keep her eyes open, causing chalk dust to get caught in her eyes and necessitating several trips to the hospital to get her eyes washed out. The scene where Trunchbull whirls Amanda Thripp (Jacqueline Steiger) by her pigtails required a harness to support the little girl, the wires of which were threaded through the pigtails and then looped around Ferris&#x27;s fingertips to give her grip. As she swung her around, the centrifugal force grew too great and tore the top part of Ferris&#x27;s finger, requiring seven or eight stitches.

The Crank House, in Altadena, stood in for Miss Trunchbull&#x27;s house. The exterior of Matilda&#x27;s house is located on Youngwood Drive in Whittier, while the library she visits is the Pasadena Public Library on East Walnut Street in Pasadena.

Suzie Wilson, Mara Wilson&#x27;s mother, was diagnosed with breast cancer in March 1995 during filming, and later died on April 27, 1996, four months before the film&#x27;s release. The film was dedicated to her memory. DeVito revealed that, prior to her death, he had shown her the final edit of the film so that she was able to see Mara&#x27;s performance.

==Music==
Two songs are featured in the film. One of them, &quot;Send Me on My Way&quot; by Rusted Root, is played twice: when four-year-old Matilda is left alone at her house, making pancakes, and at the end of the film, set to a montage of Matilda and Miss Honey playing at Miss Trunchbull&#x27;s former house. The other song is Thurston Harris&#x27; &quot;Little Bitty Pretty One&quot;, played when Matilda is learning to control her telekinetic powers. The film&#x27;s original score was composed by David Newman, a frequent collaborator of DeVito.

==Release==
===Box office===
&quot;Matilda&quot; was released on August 2, 1996. It made $8.5 million at the US box office in its opening weekend, ranking in third place behind &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; and &quot;Independence Day&quot;. The film grossed $33.5 million in the United States and Canada and $47 million worldwide against a production budget of $36 million.

===Home media===
The film was released on VHS in pan and scan and LaserDisc in widescreen on December 17, 1996, from Columbia TriStar Home Video. On June 2, 1997, it was released on a bare-bones dual-sided DVD containing fullscreen and widescreen. Another DVD rendition with more special features was released on June 7, 2005. In 2012, Danny DeVito hosted a Matilda reunion, where some of the cast reenacted scenes from the film. With the 2023 release of the film on Blu-ray in 2013, footage from the reunion was included as an extra. In September 2023, a 4K restoration of the film was released on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray, which included a Dolby Vision master, HDR10 grades, and a Dolby Atmos audio mix.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Matilda&quot; has an approval rating of 92% based on 25 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Danny DeVito-directed version of &quot;Matilda&quot; is odd, charming, and while the movie diverges from Roald Dahl, it nonetheless captures the book&#x27;s spirit&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 72 out of 100 based on reviews from 21 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B+&quot; on a scale of A to F. Writing for &quot;Empire&quot;, Caroline Westbrook gave the film a rating of three stars and praised DeVito&#x27;s clever direction.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; praised the film&#x27;s oddity, gave it three stars out of four, and wrote:

<text>The Dhofar Governorate () is the largest of the 11 governorates in the Sultanate of Oman in terms of area. It lies in southern Oman, on the eastern border with Yemen&#x27;s Al Mahrah Governorate and the southern border with Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Eastern Province. It is a rather mountainous area that covers and had a population of 416,458 in the 2020 census. Salalah is the largest city and capital of the governorate. Historically, the region was a source of frankincense. The local dialect of Arabic is Dhofari Arabic, which is distinct from that used in the rest of Oman and in Yemen.

==History==
===Archaeology===
At &quot;Aybut Al-Auwal&quot; (&quot;First Aybut&quot;) in Wadi Aybut (west-central Nejd), a site was discovered in 2011 containing more than 100 surface scatters of stone tools belonging to a regionally specific lithic industry, the late Nubian Complex, known previously only from Northeast Africa. Two optically stimulated luminescence age estimates place the Arabian Nubian Complex at 106,000 years old. This provides evidence for a distinct Middle Stone Age technocomplex in southern Arabia around the earlier part of the Marine Isotope Stage 5. Bronze Age sites of the Dhofar Survey include tomb complexes found at Hodor (al-Hudfir).

===Ancient times===
Venetian merchant Marco Polo wrote of Dhofar in The Travels of Marco Polo (c. 1300), stating:

Dhofar was a major exporter of frankincense in ancient times, with some of it being traded as far as China.

Al-Baleed (also spelled &quot;Al Blaid&quot;), an area near Salalah which contains numerous archeological finds, used to serve as the home of the Manjawi Civilization from the 12th to 16th centuries.

Prior to Omani rule, a portion of Dhofar was partially part of the sultanate of Kathiri, and was later mostly controlled by the tribes of Al-Hakli (Qara), thus given the name &quot;Qara Mountain Range&quot;. Al-Shahri were believed to be the original inhabitants of Dhofar.

===19th century===
A historical political précis on Dhofar produced by the British Government indicate that in 1876, a man named Sayyid Fadhl bin Alawi, who had arrived in Dhofar from Mecca in August 1875, had established himself as the de facto ruler of Dhofar. He claimed allegiance to the Ottomans, however, it was unknown if he was acting under their directive. With the help of Dhofari tribes he carried out warfare against the Bedouins of the interior. He was expelled by local sheikhs in January 1879.

===20th century===
Dhofar is extensively detailed in the 1917 publication &quot;Gazetteer of Arabia&quot;, produced by the Government in British India and mostly based on information gathered by J.G. Lorimer&#x27;s in his 1908 and 1915 handbook &quot;Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman and Central Arabia&quot;. In it, Dhofar&#x27;s boundaries are given as between the Samhan hills (Jebel Samhan) and the sea, from Ra&#x27;s Risut eastwards for 30 miles to Khor Rori. Colloquially, the term Dhofar was used to describe the villages of Al Haffah and Salalah, which housed about two-thirds of Dhofar&#x27;s population at that time; however, on an official capacity, the term was understood to refer to the entire region of Dhofar, much like in the modern sense. Dhofar&#x27;s physical geography was noted as consisting mainly of barren plains, a mountain range and several valleys, the most important of which was Wadi Raikut.

Communication outside of Dhofar was made difficult on account of the rugged landscape and the fact that no large harbors existed on the coast, though Mirbat and Risut were said to offer good anchorage for smaller vessels. The mountain paths were, for all intents and purposes, inaccessible during the rainy season. Aside from camels, no other transport animals were widely used. Frankincense was said to comprise the bulk of economic trade, with 9,000 cwt. being sent to Mumbai annually. Other exports were hides, sheep-skins, gums and beeswax. Among the chief imports were khat (which was mistaken for tobacco) from Mukalla and rice, sugar, dates and cloths from Mumbai.

Gordon Noel Jackson&#x27;s 1943 essay on Dhofar provides a historical glimpse into the administration of the region:

During World War I it was fertile enough to produce food and grain to supply a large proportion of the requirement of the British Army fighting in Mesopotamia.

A counter-insurgency campaign—the Omani Civil War (1963-76)—was fought here by the Sultan of Oman&#x27;s Armed Forces against guerrilla fighters of the nationalist Dhofar Liberation Front and later the Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Oman and the Persian Gulf (PFLOAG). This latter group was supported by Communist South Yemen and several other socialist states, including East Germany. It aimed to depose the Sultan&#x27;s government, who was assisted by the United Kingdom, Iran, and officers and doctors from Pakistan and India. The rebellion failed, and once the campaign was declared over in December 1975, the active remainder of PFLOAG forces surrendered.

==Population==
J.G. Lorimer noted in his 1908 manuscript, the &quot;Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman and Central Arabia&quot;, that the two main tribes of Dhofar were the mountain-dwelling Al Qara tribe (for which the Qara Mountain Range was named) and the Al Kathiri tribes (Al-Shanfari, Al-Rawas, Al-Marhoon, Bait Fadhil, Al-Mardoof and Al-Hadhri) who lived in the hills and in villages alike; both were reported to speak dialects of Arabic unknown in other parts of the Arabian Peninsula. Other tribes of importance noted by Lorimer included the Ja&#x27;afar tribe, the Bait Al Qalam tribe, the Sayid (or Sadat) tribe, the Hasarit tribe and the Harasis tribe. The inhabitants of Dhofar were described primarily as agriculturalists and were well known for their affinity to &#x27;tobacco&#x27;, possibly referring to khat which is similar in appearance. At the time of Lorimer&#x27;s survey, Dhofar had roughly 11,000 inhabitants, the majority of which were Bedouins.

In Gordon Noel Jackson&#x27;s 1943 treatise on the Dhofar Governorate, he wrote that &quot;the people of the province are as varied as the landscape&quot;. He goes on to state that the Arabs of the hills, &#x27;mountain Arabs&#x27;, were highly nomadic and were not proficient in Standard Arabic. Furthermore, it is asserted that they were not overtly observant of Islamic customs, were highly superstitious, and practiced pre-Islamic rites, much to the indignation of the Sultan of Oman. They engaged in little cultivation due to the arid landscape, instead preferring to trade incense and rear livestock.

In the past, the Hindu festival Diwali was celebrated by practicing Omani Muslims and non-Muslims alike. According to local tradition, the custom was introduced by a Brahmin who was shipwrecked off Dhofar&#x27;s coast and found a ready acceptance of the festival among the lower classes of Dhofar. Jackson (1943) states that the ruler of Oman prohibited Muslims from participating in these festivities sometime in the early 20th century.

While Arabic speakers from the dominant culture of Oman have come to live in the province, especially the larger cities and towns, Dhofar has been the traditional homeland of many tribespeople speaking Modern South Arabian languages. One of the languages most commonly spoken by Al-Hakli (Qara), Al-Shahri, Al-Barami, Al-Mashaiki and Al-Bathari mountain tribes is the Shehri language (called &quot;Jibbali&quot; &quot;Mountainous&quot;). The Yemeni language Mehri is somewhat linked to Jeballi. Other indigenous groups speaking smaller languages such as Bat&#x27;hari living in the coastal towns of Shuwaymiya and Sharbithat. The Harasis, speaking Harsusi, number 1–2000 and live in Jiddat al-Harasis.

As of April 2024, 54.9% of the population are expatriates and 45.1% are Omanis.


==Geography==
===Topography===

The Dhofar Governorate, situated in the western extremity of Oman&#x27;s territories, is enclosed by the Indian Ocean on its southern side and by the Dhofar Mountains, a semi-circular formation of mountains running into the sea at Ras Hamar and Mirbat, which shut it off from the mountains and deserts to the north, east and west. South-west monsoon (locally referred to as Khareef) clouds driving up from the Indian Ocean are here met by winds from the north and east and buffeted and depressed until they are entrapped by the mountains over the Dhofar plain. Thus, Dhofar is unique on the Southern Arabian coast in that it enjoys monsoon rainfall for some three months of the year.

The Province contains three distinct physical tracts, a cultivated coastal belt, Al Haffah, divided from the mountains by a desert plain some 40 miles in length and up to 9 miles in depth. The mountains enclosing the western end of the plain are precipitous and inaccessible while those to the east rise steeply with many sheer cliffs and deep gorges but are capped by rolling grassy uplands and interspersed with wide park-like valleys well wooded with groves of wild figs, tamarinds, acacias, sycamores. Varieties of evergreens, privets, babuls, wild olives, jasmines, camel thorn, salt cedars and an abundance of wild flowers and grasses provide ample grazing during the summer for herds of dairy cattle, camels and goats numbering many hundreds.
The uplands rise gently to a height of between 3,000 and 4,000 feet at the top of the watershed and thence slope away to the north draining into Wadi Muqshin on the southern edge of the Rub&#x27; al Khali (Empty Quarter). Cloud formations are entrapped over the enclosed plain and on southern slopes of the mountains, the reverse slopes draining to the north being practically free of clouds and devoid of moisture. It is in these wadis that the frankincense, for which the mountains have been famous through the ages, grows wild. The dryness of the air determines the quality of the frankincense, the resin of similar trees growing on the southern slopes being spoilt by the rain.

Although the southern slopes enjoy a good rainfall the ground soil does not retain the water. Underground rivers drain the waters of Jabal Aram into Wadi Darbat, the mouth of which is sealed by a sheer limestone cliff 500 feet high. The accumulated waters fill a lake two miles long, situated at a height of 1,000 feet, and overflow during the rains to form a picturesque waterfall. Other underground rivers feed perennial springs at the foot of the hills. There are six of these springs; Jarziz, the best of them, producing an estimated flow of 40,000 gallons of water an hour. These waters, if unharnessed, again disappear underground in the foothills and reappear to feed extensive fresh water creeks in the coastal belt divided from the sea only by narrow sandbars. Fresh water is easily obtainable from shallow wells at a distance of a hundred yards from high water mark and up to a distance of one mile inland, beyond which the increased depth of the water discourages prospective cultivators.

Dhofar&#x27;s forest cover was estimated to be 53,000 hectares in 1989. However, due to human actives and deforestation, it declined to 10,000 hectares in 2020. The forests are home to more than 750 flora species – including 50 native species, which counts for more than 75% of Oman&#x27;s biodiversity.

===Climate===
Dhofar has a tropical climate. Dhofar and a small portion of the northern tip of Yemen are directly exposed to the South East monsoon from mid-June to mid-September; this is known as the Khareef. Monsoon clouds keep the summer cool and humid, while the winter months are warm except for periods when cold winds from the northern deserts cause heavy and prolonged dust storms and a sharp fall in temperature. Dhofar&#x27;s heavy seasonal rainfall contrasts sharply with the neighboring barren Empty Quarter Desert. The Salalah plain was once a well cultivated area with a sophisticated irrigation system.

==Culture and landmarks==

Dhofar has a tribal community, including the tribes of Al-Kathiri are the largest number in Salalah and Dhofar in general Al-Hakli (Qara), Hashimi, Al-Yafei, Al-Mashaikhi, Al-Shahri, Al-Mahri, Al-Bat&#x27;hari, Al-Daroodi(Dhashisha, Siwaqron, Ali Saleban, Al-bahanta) and Al-Barami. It also is home to many expatriates.

Salalah, the region&#x27;s capital, has an international airport, one of the largest seaports in the Middle East, several resorts including the Marriott and the Crowne Plaza, and a university. The Burj-al-Nadha clock tower is a local landmark and is featured in the Dhofar Municipality coat of arms.

The Dhofar region is also rich in meteorites.

According to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the coasts of Dhofar, perhaps Wadi Sayq, are considered the most likely location of the Book of Mormon land of Bountiful, from which the nomadic family of Lehi sailed, some time after 600 BC, in a ship constructed by his son Nephi, to the New World.

==Administration==
===Provinces===
Dhofar Governorate consists of ten wilayats also called provinces. Al-Mazyunah is the newest after it was declared separate from the Rakhyut wilayat. It was named in honor of Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said&#x27;s mother, Mazoon bint Ahmad Al Mashani. Each wilayat comprises several villages and towns.

The following are the ten wilayats of Dhofar:
*Al-Mazyūnah (), population (2017): 9,261
*Ḍalkūt (), population (2017): 2,988
*Mirbat (), population (2017): 16,307
*Muqshin (), population (2017): 857
*Rakhyūt (), population (2017): 5,049
*Sadah (), population (2017): 5,944
*Salalah (capital of the Governorate) (), population (2017): 374,582
*Shalim and the Hallaniyat Islands (), population (2017): 4,792
*Taqah (), population (2017): 20,876
*Thumrait (), population (2017): 16,966

===Villages===
Dozens of villages are found in the governorate, particularly around the coast and near major towns. The 1917 &quot;Gazetteer of Arabia&quot;, produced by the Government in British India and based on J.G. Lorimer&#x27;s earlier &quot;Gazeteer&quot;, makes note of the locations, geography and history of several of these villages.

<doc id="675947" wikidata="Q585203" url="?curid=675947" title="Hamburger Hill">
<text>Hamburger Hill is a 1987 American war film set during the Battle of Hamburger Hill, a May 1969 assault during the Vietnam War by the U.S. Army&#x27;s 3rd Battalion, 187th Infantry, 101st Airborne Division, on a ridge of Dong Ap Bia near the Laotian border in central Vietnam. The ridge was a well-fortified position, including trenchworks and bunkers, of the North Vietnamese Army. U.S. military records of the battle refer to the mountain as &quot;Hill 937,&quot; its map designation having been derived from the high elevation of the hill at .

Written by James Carabatsos and directed by John Irvin, the film starred Michael Boatman, Don Cheadle, Dylan McDermott (his film debut), Courtney B. Vance, Steven Weber, and Tim Quill. It was produced by RKO Pictures and distributed by Paramount Pictures, and was shot in the Philippines. The novelization was written by William Pelfrey.

==Plot==

In 1969, a platoon of the 3rd Battalion, 187th Infantry, 101st Airborne Division, receives five new recruits as replacements: Beletsky; Languilli, soon called Alphabet; Washburn, the only African-American of the replacements; Bienstock; and Galvan. At the same time, platoon Sergeant First Class Worcester is breaking in a new commander, Lieutenant Eden.

The five privates are assigned to 3rd Squad, under battle-weary squad leader, Staff Sgt. Adam Frantz. Frantz gives them a crash-course in battlefield skills, punctuated by having a Viet Cong deserter silently penetrate a barbed wire barrier and aim a rocket launcher at them.

The platoon&#x27;s specialists include the machine gun team of Duffy and Gaigin, along with African-American veterans Motown, Doc and Sgt. McDaniel (who has less than a month left on his tour). The latter three often talk of their first-hand knowledge of the racial discrimination still practiced in the army.

The new arrivals get their first, sudden taste of war when a quiet spell beside a river is interrupted by an enemy mortar bombardment, during which replacement Galvan is decapitated by a bomb splinter. The death of a soldier further riles up Frantz.

The platoon is air-lifted into the A Sầu Valley for a major operation. Shortly after disembarking at the landing zone, they find themselves in a firefight, during which McDaniel is killed. This loss provokes considerable bitterness and tension from Doc, who blames Frantz for not getting the short-timer McDaniel a less dangerous assignment.

The platoon is part of the battalion&#x27;s assault on Hill 937, which soon grows into the Battle of Hamburger Hill when unexpectedly determined resistance is encountered. With the NVA defending well-entrenched positions, the platoon attacks the hill repeatedly against stubborn opposition. Between assaults, US air-strikes steadily strip away all vegetation, leaving the hill a barren, scorched wasteland. In one assault, a battle-crazed and wounded Duffy, wielding an M60 machine gun, seems on the verge of carrying the day as enemy resistance begins to crumble. However, botched air support by helicopter gunships causes several friendly casualties, including Duffy.

In between attacks, the shrinking platoon tries to rest, chattering about social upheaval and unrest back home. Bienstock is devastated by a letter from his girlfriend, whose college friends have told her that it is immoral to remain with a soldier. Beletsky gets a cassette tape from his girlfriend, and Frantz is moved that she mentions his name. Worcester describes to his comrades the alienation and hostility from anti-war college students, and the breakdown of his marriage, on his return from a previous tour of duty. He tells of a good friend, whose son had been killed in Vietnam during the 1965 Battle of Ia Drang, who receives cruel phone calls gloating over his son&#x27;s death.

On day seven, returning downhill from their ninth assault, Frantz has a confrontation with a TV reporter, telling him that he has more respect for the NVA on the hill than for the reporter, and threatens to shoot the reporter himself if he sees him taking pictures of his men.

The exhausted platoon continues the attempt to capture Hill 937. During the tenth assault, in torrential rain, Gaigin is killed while Beletsky and Doc are wounded. Doc tells Frantz and Motown to capture the hill so that they will at least have something to be proud of, then succumbs to his wounds moments before a medevac helicopter lands. Beletsky, despite having received a &quot;million dollar wound,&quot; decides to return to his unit.

The eleventh and final assault is mounted by the remaining troops, whose bitterness and exhaustion is overcome by desperation and unit pride. The final enemy positions are overrun but the cost is heavy. Lieutenant Eden loses his right arm, while Murphy, Worcester, Motown, Bienstock and Languilli are killed. Frantz, stunned by the loss of so many friends, is dazed and wounded by an enemy bayonet. Beletsky, also wounded but enraged, leads the final push to the summit. At the summit, the bleeding and exhausted Frantz, Washburn and Beletsky sit together in the dirt, as the battlefield finally goes silent.

==Epilogue==
The movie epilogue is a poem by Major Michael Davis O&#x27;Donnell, January 1, 1970, Dak To, Vietnam which reads as follows: &quot;If you are able, save for them a place inside of you and save one backward glance when you are leaving for the places they can no longer go. Be not ashamed to say you loved them, though you may not have always. Take what they have left and what they have taught you with their dying and keep it with your own. And in that time when men decide and feel safe to call the war insane, take one moment to embrace those gentle heroes you left behind.&quot;

==Novelization==
The novelized version of the film, written by William Pelfrey, based on the screenplay by James Carabatsos, featured several additional scenes not featured in the final cut of the film. These included prologue and epilogue scenes set years after the war where Frantz, now a civilian and happily married with children, visits the Vietnam Memorial Wall in Washington, D.C. and asks his young son to plant a small flag below Languilli&#x27;s name. Another additional scene occurs one night between the assaults on Hill 937, where the North Vietnamese Army launch a surprise counterattack.

==Cast==

&quot;NOTE: Listed in order of authority and rank. The green color coded boxes in the rows indicate that character survived the battle. The pink colored boxes indicate the character either died or was wounded. Actors and roles as credited onscreen.&quot;
==Production==
Producer Marcia Nasatir had a son who fought as a soldier in Vietnam, which is one of the reasons why she came up with the idea for the film. Writer and co-producer James Carabatsos had served with the 1st Cavalry Division in 1968–69 and spent five years interviewing soldiers involved in the combat there and researching the Battle of Hamburger Hill. Irvin, an English-born filmmaker, worked on several documentaries in Vietnam in 1969.

The film was produced independently, with the money being raised through foreign sales. According to Irvin, Paramount passed on Hamburger Hill when they initially pitched it, but they picked it up when the film was finally shot in the Philippines.

== Release ==
In a 2021 interview John Irvin said that Hamburger Hill could have been released before &quot;Platoon&quot; and &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; &quot;if Paramount had been a bit braver&quot;. Because Vietnam was not considered a popular subject, Paramount wanted to see how &quot;Platoon&quot; performed at the box office. According to Irvin, &quot;Hamburger Hill&quot; was again pushed back when Stanley Kubrick pushed for &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; to be released before &quot;Hamburger Hill.&quot;

==Reception==
===Critical response===

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;Hamburger Hill&quot; a &quot;well-made Vietnam War film that narrows its attention to the men of a single platoon in a specific operation&quot;. Differentiating the film from &quot;Platoon&quot;, released the year before, he noted the film &quot;refuses to put its characters and events into any larger frame. It could have been made a week after the conclusion of the operation it recalls, which is both its strength and weakness, depending on how you look at it&quot;. Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; credited the filmmakers for creating a &quot;deeply affecting, highly accomplished film&quot;, but felt that &quot;[Carabatsos] and his collaborators seem to feel compelled not only to show us their war, but tell us what we&#x27;re to think about it&quot;, weakening the film&#x27;s effect and keeping it from being a &quot;great war movie&quot;.

===Box office===
In the United States and Canada, &quot;Hamburger Hill&quot; grossed $13.8million at the box office. It opened at No. 4 for its first weekend, spending its first three weeks in the Top 10 at the box office.

<text>SUNY Orange (Orange County Community College) is a public community college with two campuses, one in Middletown, New York, and one in Newburgh, New York. It is part of the State University of New York (SUNY) system and offers almost 40 associate degrees and certificate programs. SUNY Orange is accredited by Middle States Commission on Higher Education. The college employs an open enrollment policy to all applicants who are graduates of an accredited high school or recipients of a state high school equivalency diploma.

==History==
As late as 1945, on the west side of the Hudson River from New York City to the state capital at Albany, there were only two colleges, the United States Military Academy at West Point and what would become SUNY New Paltz. Orange County did not have a public college, and consequently in 1948, research began to find a suitable site.

The Webb Horton House and property, now the &#x27;mansion&#x27; at the Middletown campus, was chosen for founding the college. Built by Webb Horton, the mansion was left to his cousin, John H. Morrison, upon his death. His wife Mrs. Christine Morrison, lived there alone after the death of her husband in 1946. In 1950, she donated the mansion and property as the home of Orange County Community College.

The College was founded in 1950, opening its doors to 160 students as the first county-sponsored community college in the SUNY system. It was the first community college in the nation to offer a two-year nursing degree program.

When it opened, the College consisted of Morrison Hall and Horton Hall, on 14 acres. Today, it has 12 buildings at the Middletown campus, and two buildings at the Newburgh campus.

==Campuses==
SUNY Orange comprises two campuses: the main one in city of Middletown, New York and the Newburgh branch campus, situated on the banks of the Hudson River.
==Academics==
SUNY Orange offers a total of 39 associate degrees and certificate programs. As of 2023, the college enrolled approximately 6,500 students annually. The college has matriculation agreements with more than 30 four-year institutions, facilitating the transfer of SUNY Orange students graduating with an associate degree who want to complete 4-year degrees.

==Student life==
The Middletown campus offers a dental clinic, fitness studios, a swimming pool, soccer and softball fields, computer and tutorial labs, child-care facilities, theatre, gymnasium, art gallery, gaming rooms and micro-markets on-campus. The Newburgh campus has its own child-care facilities, fitness room, micro-market, art gallery, and gaming room. The college also has a chapter of Phi Theta Kappa, the international honors society for two-year colleges.

The college also has an Alumni Relations office which holds events specifically for alumni throughout the year. 

==Community programs and events==
The college&#x27;s Continuing and Professional Education department offers G.E.D. programs, industry certifications and personal enrichments programs. The ENCORE program offers classes for people over 50. The college allows free auditing of classes for community members 60 or above. The college&#x27;s Cultural Affairs department has a variety of exhibits, lectures, master classes, theater performances and concerts each semester which are open to the public.

<text>The Ordnance Quick-Firing 17-pounder (or just 17-pdr) was a 76.2 mm (3 inch) gun developed by the United Kingdom during World War II. It was used as an anti-tank gun on its own carriage, as well as equipping a number of British tanks. Used with the APDS shot, it was capable of defeating all but the thickest armour on German tanks. It was used to &quot;up-gun&quot; some foreign-built vehicles in British service, notably to produce the Sherman Firefly variant of the US M4 Sherman tank, giving British tank units the ability to hold their own against their German counterparts. In the anti-tank role, it was replaced after the war by the 120 mm BAT recoilless rifle. As a tank gun, it was succeeded by the 84 mm 20 pounder.

==Development history==
===Gun development===
Before the QF 6-pounder had entered service, the British predicted that it would soon be inadequate given the increasing armour of German tanks. In late 1940, the design of a replacement began, and was largely completed by the end of 1941. A prototype production line was set up in spring 1942, and with the appearance of Tiger I tanks in early 1943 in the North African Campaign, the first 100 prototype 17-pounder anti-tank guns were quickly sent to help counter this new threat. So great was the rush that they were sent before proper carriages had been developed, and the guns had to be mounted in the carriages of 25-pounder gun-howitzers. These early weapons were known as 17/25-pounders and given the codename &quot;Pheasant&quot;. They first saw action in February 1943.

Fully developed 17-pounders started production in 1943 and were first used during the Italian Campaign. They became one of the most effective weapons on the battlefield, on both carriages and tanks.

The 17-pounder anti-tank guns also saw action in Korea against tanks and in general support use against bunker positions. After Korea, the gun was largely replaced in the tank role by the 84mm calibre, Ordnance QF 20 pounder, and in the anti-tank role by the BAT, MOBAT and 120 mm L6 WOMBAT series of recoilless rifles.

===Adaptation into tanks and AFVs===

The 17-pounder outperformed all other Allied armour-piercing guns, and was quickly adapted for use on various tank chassis. However, few tanks were capable of carrying such a large gun due to the size limitations of their turret rings. A new British tank specification, A29, was produced to meet the need for a 17-pounder armed cruiser tank. While the A29 was eventually cancelled without a successful design being produced, an amended specification, A30, reached production in 1943. The A30 specification reduced weight and enabled the use of Cromwell tank components as a design expedient. The resulting Cruiser Mark VIII Challenger had a longer hull and provided a larger turret, allowing the 17-pounder to be mounted along with space for a second loader, thought to be required for the gun&#x27;s larger ammunition. However, production of the tank took time and few could be completed before the allied invasion of Normandy.

While developing the Challenger tank, the British devised a conversion for their US-supplied M4 Sherman tanks to mount the 17-pounder. This was applied in sufficient numbers to put them into service in time for D-Day as the Sherman Firefly. The gun was a modified design that was produced specifically for the Firefly, the MkIV. A new horizontal-sliding breech was designed as the usual vertical-sliding breech of the Mks I and II made loading very difficult. An additional box was welded to the back of the turret to take the radio, which was moved to allow for the breech and its recoil. A new recoil mechanism, based on the 6-pounder design, was developed and the thicker section of the gun barrel in contact with the cradle was lengthened to match the new recoil system. The original experimental Sherman mounting at Lulworth was actually rigid with no recoil system. Production of the Challenger was cancelled with only about 200 built, and 2,200 - 2,400 Sherman Is and Vs were converted as Fireflies (sources vary) and deployed in Sherman regiments Italy and NW Europe. The Challengers were deployed with Cromwell regiments.

The British also converted some of their US-produced M10 tank destroyers, replacing the 3-inch (76 mm) M7 gun with the 17-pounder; the resulting vehicles were called 17pdr SP Achilles or just &quot;17-pdr M10C&quot;. These served with Royal Artillery as self-propelled guns.

The 17-pounder was also successfully trialled on the Australian-designed Sentinel tank, though no Sentinels equipped with this gun entered service with the Australian Army.

Efforts to fit the 17pdr on a Cromwell chassis in a better manner than the ungainly Challenger resulted in the Comet tank. However the Comet could still not take the 17pdr. The 75mm High Velocity Gun project was resurrected and redesigned to use a shortened version of the 17pdr barrel and the 17pdr projectiles mated to the cartridge of the 3 inch 30cwt anti-aircraft gun. While often confused with the 17pdr, the 77mm HV, was an entirely separate weapon and was only used on the Comet.

As the war came to a close, the 17-pdr was fitted to the new Centurion tank, then designated as a &quot;heavy cruiser&quot; tank until ultimately being replaced by the 20-pounder in 1949. The Centurion was the first tank designed around the 17pdr gun.

The United States Army did not use the 17-pdr. Although the gun was offered to them and tested, they chose to stick with their 76 mm gun M1. US forces did however request some Firefly conversions in March 1945 and as many as 18 were converted but the war ended before they were shipped from the UK.

==Variants==

;Mark I
: first production versions.
;Mark II
: intended for tank use. Removed the carrier mountings and replaced the muzzle brake with a counterweight. The brake was added back on in March 1944 with the introduction of the APDS shot. The Mk. II was used on the Archer self-propelled anti-tank gun and Cruiser Mark VIII Challenger tank.
;Mark III
: Royal Navy adaptation for use on landing craft, generally similar to the Mk. I, but included an automatic loading system. Unused.
;Mark IV
: Another tank adaptation, this time with a different breech where the block slid to the side instead of down to take up less room. Used on Sherman Firefly.
;Mark V
: A version of the Mk IV with different mounts to allow it to replace the US 3 in (76.2 mm) Gun M7 on the M10 tank destroyer, creating the 17pdr SP Achilles.
;Mark VI
: Another Mk. IV adaptation with a shortened breech.
;Mark VII
: Similar to the Mk. VI, yet another change to the breech.
;Straussler Conversion
: This was an experimental gun, designed by Nicholas Straussler that was fitted with a motorized gun-carriage. A modified ammunition limber would be attached to the gun&#x27;s trails, making a four-wheeled, self-propelled vehicle and removing the need for a truck to tow the gun.

===77 mm HV===
The British started work on developing a gun that was small enough to fit on their tank designs—particularly the Cromwell cruiser tank then at the design stage. It was intended to fire the US 75 mm projectiles (AP shot and HE) at a higher velocity, avoiding a downgrade in armour penetration versus the 6-pounder, which the dual purpose 75 mm was replacing. The new 50-calibre long gun, known as the Vickers HV 75 mm, fired a 75 mm projectile attached to a necked down 3-inch (76.2 mm) 20 cwt AA gun cartridge through a modified breech. The larger 3&quot; cartridge provided a greater propellant charge compared with normal 75 mm shells. Although the 75 mm HV was a promising weapon, it proved to be too big for the Cromwell tank, which was ultimately fitted with the normal QF 75 mm gun in use on other British tanks. To account for this difference, tank squadrons were teamed with Challenger and Sherman Firefly tanks armed with the 17-pounder.

When the Cromwell&#x27;s replacement, the Comet, was at the design stage, the 75 mm HV concept was reworked to fire the same projectiles as the 17-pounder through a shortened 17-pounder barrel but retaining the 3-inch cartridge case firing from a standard 3-inch breech. This has the benefit of greater ease of use on tanks, many of which would not have sufficient turret space to accommodate the breech length and recoil distance of the 17-pounder. Similarly, the smaller 3&quot;-based ammunition was easier to store and handle in the tank&#x27;s cramped interior. This new gun&#x27;s ammunition was not interchangeable with the 17-pounder and to prevent confusion over ammunition supplies, it was renamed the 77 mm HV—the &#x27;HV&#x27; standing for &quot;High Velocity&quot;—although it was the same 76.2 mm calibre as the 17-pounder.

==Ammunition==

The 17-pounder used the following ammunition types:
;Armour Piercing Capped (APC)
:Armour Piercing Capped was a basic AP shell used with field guns, but was not used when the 17pdr was mounted in the Sherman Firefly tank.
;Armour Piercing, Capped, Ballistic Capped (APCBC)
:Armour Piercing, Capped, Ballistic Capped ammunition could penetrate 163 mm of armour at 500 metres and 150 mm at 1000 m.
;Armour-piercing discarding sabot (APDS)
:Armour-piercing discarding sabot could penetrate 256 mm of armour at 500 m and 233 mm at 1000 m, and allowing it in theory to penetrate the armour of even the German Tiger II heavy tank. Most sources are in agreement that APDS was not available on D-Day itself, but reached Normandy in increasing amounts by the end of June or early July 1944. It was available for the breakout battle from Normandy and the advance to the Netherlands and Germany. The weight of the enclosed shot, excluding the enclosing sabot, was .There were accuracy issues using APDS caused by the muzzle brake aperture being too small to allow a clean separation of the sabot. Teams of engineers visited tank and artillery regiments, with equipment to boring the aperture slightly. New guns were modified in the factory.
;High Explosive (HE)
:The HE shells for the 17-pounder had smaller bursting charges (Mk 1: 1.28 lbs, Mk 2: 1.06 lbs) than those for the 75mm gun used by the Sherman (M48: 1.47 lbs, Mk 1: 1.64 lbs).
;Practice, Shot Mk 10
:&quot;The components of this practice round are similar to those of Shot APCBC, except for the projectile. The projectile is made of cast iron and is uncapped. It is fitted with tracer.&quot;

APCBC ammunition was the standard ammunition for the gun, while APDS shot was used for about 6% of the average load of a 17-pounder-equipped British tank.

While offering greater penetration, the smaller (sub-calibre) tungsten core of APDS was considered to provide less accurate fire than APCBC ammunition at ranges beyond 500 yards. This was due to the much lesser visible impact of rounds that fell short, making it hard to spot the fall of shot and correct aim. The APDS was also considered to cause less damage to an enemy tank if it did penetrate the armour. After penetration the core usually disintegrated.

The 17-pounder produced a very large muzzle flash due to the large amount of propellant in its cartridges. Muzzle blast was also significant, described by crews of the anti-tank gun variant as resembling a hard slap on the chest.

NH = non-hygroscopic; i.e. does not absorb moisture.

HC = High capacity.

EFC = Equivalent full charge. EFC was the basis of calculating the wear effect of propellent charges. Instructions were to examine the barrel for wear after every 40 EFC.

==Performance==

* FH marks the performance against face hardened armour (FHA), as opposed to rolled homogeneous armour (RHA).

==Use==
===Anti-tank gun===
The 17-pounder was a much bulkier and heavier weapon than its predecessor. As a result, it had to be towed by a gun tractor, such as the Morris Quad, M3 Half-track or the Crusader, as it could not effectively be moved by its gun crew alone, especially on poor ground. After firing on soft ground, the 17-pounder frequently had to be pulled out of the ground due to the gun recoil burying the trail spades. After the Second World War, it was issued to anti-tank units of the Royal Artillery in the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) towed by the M3 Half Track. When the Royal Artillery anti-tank units were disbanded in 1951, it was transferred to Infantry battalions in the BAOR (six per battalion), towed by the Oxford Tracked Carrier. It was later replaced by the 120 mm BAT recoilless rifle anti-tank weapon.
====Pheasant carriage====
Also known by the 17/25 pounder designation, a stop-gap measure named &quot;Pheasant&quot; mated the 17 pounder gun with a modified 25 pounder carriage. This enabled the gun to be pressed into service before its own carriage design was ready.

====Split trail carriage====
A custom designed carriage for the 17 pounder comprising:
* Split trail carriage, with gunshield.
* Weight: 3 t.
* Elevation: −6° to +16.5°
* Traverse: 60°

===Middle East===
In the immediate post-war era in the Middle East, Arab national armies - Transjordan, Egypt, Syria and Iraq - mainly used British manufactured artillery, including the towed 17-pounder. The Israelis used a number of 17 pounders that they captured from the Arabs in the war of independence

===Vehicle mount===

<text>Athabasca (2021 population 2,759), originally named Athabasca Landing, is a town in northern Alberta, Canada. It is located north of Edmonton at the intersection of Highway 2 and Highway 55, on the banks of the Athabasca River. It is the centre of Athabasca County. It was known as Athabasca Landing prior to August 4, 1913.

== History ==

The name &quot;Athabasca&quot; is of Cree origin. Early spellings: Araubaska (Peter Pond) and Athapescow (Arrowsmith). Various interpretations of the meaning: &quot;where there are reeds&quot; (Douglas); &quot;meeting place of many waters&quot; (Voorhis). The town was first called Athabasca Landing about 1889; the name changed to Athabaska in 1904, and then changed back to Athabasca in 1948. The provisional district of Athabasca was established in 1882, encompassing the northern parts of modern Alberta and Saskatchewan.

Unlike many other towns in Alberta, Athabasca predates the Canadian Pacific Railway. Athabasca lies on a southern protrusion of the Athabasca River. During the fur trade era, when rivers were the principal means of transportation, the Athabasca–Edmonton trail connected two different drainage basins. The Athabasca River flows north and is part of the Mackenzie River watershed, which leads to the Arctic Ocean. Edmonton lies across a height-of-land on the North Saskatchewan River in the Nelson River drainage basin, which empties into Hudson Bay. Edmonton was in Rupert&#x27;s Land, but Athabasca was not. Athabasca was the terminus of the Edmonton to Athabasca Landing trail, which allowed goods to be portaged back and forth between river systems. Once agricultural settlement occurred, the trail continued to serve a similar purpose. Eventually, road and rail links were established following the same path.
In 1876, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) built a warehouse at Athabasca Landing to facilitate the supply route to Lesser Slave Lake. The site was expanded in 1886 with a store, house, and new larger warehouse, and it became a full trading post. Further expansion included a stable, powder magazine, workshop and storeman&#x27;s house. By 1889, it had become the HBC&#x27;s headquarters of northern transport.

The North-West Mounted Police stationed officers at Athabasca Landing for the summer of 1892, due to increased traffic on the trail. Inspector D.M. Howard, and eight constables, built a permanent post in 1893.

In 1912, the HBC had the steamers &quot;Slave River&quot; and &quot;Athabasca River&quot; built at Athabasca Landing for travel on the Athabasca and Peace Rivers.

A massive forest fire in August 1913 destroyed a large portion of the town, including 30 businesses. There was no loss of life. Rebuilding of the town began immediately. The HBC post was rebuilt in 1914 and operated until 1924.

The Athabasca Heritage Society put up signs through the downtown as well as along the riverfront that explain and depict the history of the town. It has also published a historical walking tour that is available from the town office, library and visitor information center.

<doc id="676011" wikidata="Q2656122" url="?curid=676011" title="Dom people">
<text>The Dom (also called Domi; / ALA-LC: &#x27;, / ,Ḍom/ or , or sometimes also calledDoms) are descendants of the Dom caste with origins in the Indian subcontinent which through ancient migrations are found scattered across the Middle East and North Africa, the Eastern Anatolia Region, and parts of the Balkans and Hungary. The traditional language of the Dom is Domari, an endangered Indo-Aryan language, thereby making the Dom an Indo-Aryan ethnic group.

The Doms were formerly grouped with other traditionally itinerant ethnic groups originating from medieval India: the Rom and Lom peoples. However, these groups left India at different times and used different routes. The Domari language has a separate origin in India from Romani, and Doms are not closer to the Romani people than other Indians, such as Gujaratis. Dom people do not identify themselves as Romanis.

== Culture ==
The Dom have an oral tradition and express their culture and history through music, poetry, and dance. Initially, it was believed that they were a branch of the Romani people, but recent studies of the Domari language suggest that they departed from the Indian subcontinent at different times and using different routes.

Among the various Domari subgroups, they were initially part of Ghawazi who were known for their dancing and music business. Some Muslim Roma may share Dom ancestry too, because in the travel book &quot;Seyahatnâme&quot;, written by the Ottoman Turkish traveller Evliya Çelebi in 1668, he explained that the Romani from Komotini (Gümülcine) believe that their ancestors originated in Ottoman Egypt. Also the sedentary Romani groups from Serres region in Greece believe their ancestors were once taken from Ottoman Egypt by the Turks after 1517 to Rumelia, to work on the tobacco plantations of Turkish feudals that were based there.

Muslim Roma settled in Baranya and the city of Pécs in southwestern Hungary. After the Siege of Pécs (1686), when the Habsburgs took it back, Muslim Roma and some other Muslim ethnic minorities abandoned Islam and converted to Christianity, choosing the Roman Catholic faith in the years 1686–1713. The Ghagar, a subgroup of the Doms in Egypt, say that some of them went to Hungary.

==Language==
Domari shows Turkic, Kurdish and Arabic influence. Domari in the Middle East is known as Nawari.

== Distribution ==
The Dom people, with an estimated population of 2.2 million, predominantly inhabit regions spanning Turkey, Egypt, Greece, Jordan, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran. The actual population is believed to surpass this estimate, given that some Dom individuals are left out of official national censuses, and others identify themselves using national labels rather than the term &quot;Dom.&quot;

There is a large concentration of Doms in Jordan, where they call themselves &quot;Bani Murra&quot;. Researchers have written that &quot;they accommodate Arab racism by hiding their ethnic identity&quot;, since they would not be accepted into Arab societies once their true identity is revealed due to the anti-Romani sentiment that is prevalent in the Arab world. Their community numbers around 70,000 in Jordan according to estimates in 2015.

A small community in east Jerusalem lives in Bab Huta neighborhood, in the Old City of Jerusalem. The population in Jerusalem is around 15,000

The population in Lebanon is around 3,112 (estimated).

==Al-Nawar==
Al-Nawar () is an Arabic term for several nomad communities used primarily in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine. The term, regarded as derogatory, is used by Arabs for several diverse ethnic groups. They have historically been called &quot;Gypsies&quot;, though as a whole they are not Romani &quot;per se&quot;. The Dom people are especially known as Nawar. While both they and Romani people originated from the Indian subcontinent, they came from two drastically different ethnicities and cultures. The Nawar in Palestine are also known as &quot;Ghajars&quot; (gypsies).

The &quot;Nawar&quot; in Syria number 100,000 to 250,000 people according to estimations. The vast majority is sedentary.

<doc id="676030" wikidata="Q7100850" url="?curid=676030" title="Ordinary referendum">
<text>An ordinary referendum in Ireland is a referendum on a bill other than a bill to amend the Constitution. The Constitution prescribes the process in Articles 27 (&quot;Reference of Bills to the People&quot;) and 47 (&quot;The Referendum&quot;). Whereas a &quot;constitutional referendum&quot; is mandatory for a constitutional amendment bill, an ordinary referendum occurs only if the bill &quot;contains a proposal of such national importance that the will of the people thereon ought to be ascertained&quot;. This is decided at the discretion of the President, after a petition by Oireachtas members including a majority of Senators. No such petition has ever been presented, and thus no ordinary referendum has ever been held.

==Overview==
The Oireachtas is a bicameral legislature in which Dáil Éireann, the lower house, is much more powerful than Seanad Éireann, the upper house. The Seanad cannot veto bills passed by the Dáil; it can at most delay them for 90 days before they are deemed to have been passed. The ordinary referendum in theory allows the Seanad to exercise a check on the Dáil by providing a mechanism for it to prevent the passing of a bill with which it disagrees. However, the composition of the Seanad, especially the fact that 11 of the 60 Senators are nominated by the Taoiseach, means that it usually has a pro-government majority and will not oppose a government bill.

The process leading to an ordinary referendum is in several stages:
* the Dáil passes a bill and sends it to the Seanad
* &quot;either&quot;
** the Seanad rejects or amends the bill; &quot;or&quot;
** 90 days elapse without the Seanad passing or rejecting the bill
* the Dáil passes a resolution deeming the bill to have been passed unamended by the Seanad
* Oireachtas members petition the President to refer the bill to the people
* the President 
** confers with the Council of State; &quot;and&quot;
** decides to refer the bill to the people
* the Government decides to hold a referendum
* the referendum is held

The petition process is outlined in Article 27 of the Constitution and detailed in the Constitution (Verification of Petition) Act, 1944.

The referendum process is broadly similar to that for a constitutional referendum; both are outlined in Article 47 of the Constitution and detailed in the Referendum Act, 1994. The electorate, as for constitutional referendums and Presidential elections, consists of all Irish citizens who are either resident in the state or abroad on diplomatic or Defence Forces assignments. Both ordinary and constitutional referendums will approve a bill if a majority of votes are cast in favour of it. However, an ordinary referendum will not reject a bill unless at least one-third of voters on the electoral register vote against it. The bill will still become law even if a majority of those who vote reject it, provided the overall turnout is low. Hogan &quot;et al.&quot; call this restriction &quot;altogether unsatisfactory&quot;, and consider it another reason why no such referendum has been held.

==Process==
Once a bill is passed by both houses of the Oireachtas, or passed by the Dáil and deemed to have been passed by the Seanad, it is sent to the President to be signed into law. The President must wait five days before signing, unless the Seanad agrees to an expedited signature. This gives five days for the presentation of a petition under Article 27, to &quot;request the President to decline to sign and promulgate as a law [the Bill,] on the ground that the Bill contains a proposal of such national importance that the will of the people thereon ought to be ascertained&quot;. Such a petition must be signed by a majority of the Seanad (i.e. at least 31 Senators) and at least one-third of the Dáil (currently 53 of 158 TDs). Signatures are validated by the chief or assistant clerk of the relevant house, or by a Justice of the District Court, a Commissioner for Oaths, or an officer of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of Superintendent. Forging a signature is punishable as electoral fraud.

In considering the petition, the President must convene a meeting of the Council of State, which gives non-binding advice in the exercise of most of his discretionary powers. He may separately decide to refer the bill to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution; in which case, he will not consider the Article 27 petition until after the Court has stated that the bill is not repugnant to the Constitution.

The President has 10 days to decide on the petition, or 6 days if there was an Article 26 decision beforehand. If he rejects the petition, he simply signs the bill as normal; if he accepts it, he informs the Taoiseach, Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil, and Cathaoirleach of the Seanad in writing. The Constitution specifies that one of two things may happen within 18 months of the decision to refer the bill to the people:
* an ordinary referendum approves the bill; or
* a general election is held, followed by a resolution of the Dáil approving the bill. The intervening general election is presumed to have given the same mandate for the bill that an ordinary referendum would have given.

If either happens, the President must then sign the bill. If neither happens, the bill lapses by default. The authority to decide whether to hold a referendum is vested in the Government by the Referendum Act 1994.

==History==
The 1922 Constitution of the Irish Free State included in Article 47 provision for a referendum similar to the current 1937 Constitution&#x27;s ordinary referendum. The procedure required, first, a petition by 40% of TDs or 50% of Senators for a 90-day stay on the Governor-General&#x27;s giving Royal Assent to the bill, and then either a resolution by the Seanad or a petition by 5% of voters demanding a referendum. Approval of a law under Article 47 required half of votes cast at referendum, whereas approval of a Constitutional amendment (under Article 50) required either half of registered voters or two-thirds of votes cast.

The sole attempt to invoke this was in relation to the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1927, which penalised Oireachtas members who refused to take the Oath of Allegiance. Fianna Fáil TDs, who were abstentionist and refused to take the Oath, attempted to lodge a petition under Article 47; the then government introduced another bill to amend the Constitution such that only TDs and Senators who had taken the Oath would have the power to make such a petition. When Fianna Fáil subsequently entered the Dáil, the next government deleted Article 47 from the Constitution altogether in 1928.

The current 1937 Constitution included a transitional provision for the first President&#x27;s first three years, during which constitutional amendments could be enacted without referendum. The President could override this and demand a referendum: unlike an ordinary referendum, no Oireachtas petition was required, although a meeting of the Council of State was. In the event, both the First Amendment (1939) and the Second Amendment (1941) were passed with cross-party support and signed by Douglas Hyde without referendum.

The 2013 bill to abolish the Seanad would, if enacted, also have removed the provision for ordinary referendums. This was given as a reason for opposing the bill by Professor Richard Sinnott, the Green Party, and Éamon Ó Cuív.

==Mooted petitions==
Although no petition to the President has ever been made under Article 27, there are several instances where the possibility of such a petition being made has entered the public debate about proposed bills.

Senator Michael O&#x27;Higgins intended to lodge a petition in relation to the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Act 1971, in the light of Operation Demetrius in Northern Ireland. When in 1974 O&#x27;Higgins demanded the Family Planning Bill be rejected as not having been put to the people, Senator Mary Robinson criticised him for not advocating the Article 27 procedure instead.

David Norris launched a petition regarding the Broadcasting Bill 1990. He stated that it was unlikely to receive enough signatures, but might convince the President to refer the bill to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution.

Abortion in the Republic of Ireland is very controversial and has been the subject of multiple constitutional referendums. The 1992 X Case judgment found a limited right to abortion and a corresponding lacuna in statute law. Subsequent governments hesitated to address this for fear of voter backlash. When the 1992 government introduced a constitutional amendment to roll back the X-case judgment, John Bruton suggested instead passing an ordinary statute to regulate the situation and using an Article 27 referendum. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; in 1995 reported attempts to have an Article 27 petition on the Regulation of Information (Services outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Bill, which eased the ban on publication of information about foreign abortion providers. The Bill did have an Article 26 referral, which found it to be Constitutional; but there was insufficient support in the Oireachtas for a petition.

In 1997, the then government considered the possibility of using Article 27 on legislation for the X-case judgment, on the basis that the extra mandate of a popular vote would have forestalled complaints from anti-abortion campaigners if the Oireachtas had legislated in the normal manner. The proposal was criticised as a misuse of the ordinary-referendum provision, which was intended to allow a group opposed to a bill to petition the President, rather than a government supporting a bill to do so. The idea was ultimately dropped because the minimum-turnout condition would have meant that a bill passed by the Oireachtas and rejected by a majority of voters on a low turnout would become law, exacerbating the controversy the idea was intended to forestall. Instead the government proposed both a constitutional amendment and a separate non-amendment bill, the &quot;Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Bill&quot;, but with the latter as a schedule to the former, so that a single referendum could approve both. A court-case questioned the legality of this, arguing that the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Bill should instead have been subject to a separate ordinary referendum. The High Court found the procedure to be acceptable. In the event, the amendment was rejected at referendum so the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Bill was never introduced.

Brian Hayes said he would start a petition for the bill to trial electronic voting machines in the 2002 general election. Sinn Féin advocated a referendum on the 2009 bill establishing the National Asset Management Agency.

In 2012, the government took some time to decide whether the ratification of the European Fiscal Compact would be passed by ordinary law or as a constitutional amendment. The opposition threatened to invoke Article 27 to force a referendum in the former case, which was one factor in the government&#x27;s decision to use a constitutional amendment, which was passed at referendum.

In 2013, the media reported that some government and opposition backbenchers were contemplating invoking Article 27 in relation to the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013, the government&#x27;s bill to enforce the X-case judgment.

Sinn Féin, during controversy over Irish Water, called on President Michael D. Higgins to refer the Water Services Bill 2014 to the people; the Office of the President responded that without the prescribed Oireachtas petition, he was unable to do so.

<text>Saint Winifred (or Winefride; ; ) was a Welsh virgin martyr of the 7th century. Her story was celebrated as early as the 8th century, but became popular in England in the 12th, when her hagiography was first written down.

A healing spring at the traditional site of her decapitation and restoration is now a shrine and pilgrimage site called St Winefride&#x27;s Well in Holywell, Flintshire, in Wales and known as &quot;the Lourdes of Wales&quot;, which was granted the status of National Shrine for England and Wales in November 2023.

==Life and legend==

The oldest accounts of Winifred&#x27;s life date to the 12th century. According to legend, Winifred was the daughter of a chieftain of Tegeingl, Welsh nobleman Tyfid ap Eiludd. Her mother was Wenlo, a niece of Saint Beuno, and a member of a family closely connected with the kings of south Wales.

According to legend, her suitor, Caradog, was enraged when she decided to become a nun and when she refused his advances, he decapitated her. A healing spring appeared where her head fell. Winifred&#x27;s head was subsequently rejoined to her body due to the efforts of Beuno, and she was restored to life. Seeing the murderer leaning on his sword with an insolent and defiant air, Beuno invoked the chastisement of heaven, and Caradog fell dead on the spot, the popular belief being that the ground opened and swallowed him. Beuno left Holywell, and returned to Caernarfon; before he left, the tradition is that he seated himself upon a stone, which now stands in the outer well pool, and there promised in the name of God &quot;that whosoever on that spot should thrice ask for a benefit from God in the name of St. Winefride would obtain the grace he asked if it was for the good of his soul.&quot;

After eight years spent at Holywell, Winifred received an inspiration to leave the convent and retire inland. Accordingly, Winifred went upon her pilgrimage to seek a place of rest. Ultimately she arrived at Gwytherin near the source of the River Elwy. She later became a nun and abbess at Gwytherin in Denbighshire. More elaborate versions of this tale relate many details of her life, including Winefride&#x27;s pilgrimage to Rome.

Given the late date of the earliest surviving written accounts of Winifred&#x27;s life, her existence has been doubted since the 19th century. She is not recorded in any Welsh pedigree of saints nor in the 13th-century calendar of Welsh saints. There is, however, evidence of her cult from centuries before the appearance of her first hagiography. Two small pieces of an oak reliquary from the 8th century were discovered in 1991 and identified based on earlier drawings as belonging to the &quot;Arch Gwenfrewi&quot;, the reliquary of Winifred. The reliquary probably contained an article of clothing or another object associated with the saint, but not her bones. According to historian Lynne Heidi Stumpe, the reliquary provides &quot;good evidence for her having been recognized as a saint very soon after her death&quot;, and thus of her historicity. The reliquary may even be &quot;the earliest surviving testimony to the formal cultus of any Welsh saint&quot;.

==Veneration==
Veneration of Winifred as a martyr saint is attested from the 12th century. She is mostly venerated in England, not in Wales, which led Caesar Baronius to list her as an &quot;English saint&quot; in his &quot;Roman Martyrology&quot; of 1584.

In 1138, relics of Winifred were carried to Shrewsbury to form the basis of an elaborate shrine. The Church of St. Winifred, Stainton is a 12th century church located in the village of Stainton, South Yorkshire, England.

===Cult===
The details of Winifred&#x27;s life are gathered from a manuscript in the British Museum, said to have been the work of the British monk, Elerius, a contemporary of the saint, and also from a manuscript life in the Bodleian Library, generally believed to have been compiled in 1130 by Robert, prior of Shrewsbury ( 1168). Prior Robert is generally credited with greatly promoting the cult of St. Winifred by translating her relics from Gwytherin to Shrewsbury Abbey and writing the most influential life of the saint. The chronicler John of Tynemouth also wrote of Winifred.

To further enhance the prestige of the Abbey, Abbot Nicholas Stevens built a new shrine for St. Winifred in the 14th century, before then having some monks steal the relics of St. Beuno from Rhewl and installed in the abbey church. Although the abbey was fined, it was allowed to keep the relics.

William Caxton&#x27;s 1483 edition of the Golden Legend includes the story of St. Winifred. The following year, he printed a separate &quot;Life&quot; of the saint.
The shrine and well at Shrewsbury became major pilgrimage goals in the Late Middle Ages, but the shrine was destroyed by Henry VIII in 1540.

St Winefride&#x27;s Well in Flintshire, originally formed from a mountain spring, is housed below the town on the side of a steep hill. The well precinct also houses an &#x27;Interpretive Exhibition&#x27;, setting forth the story of the saint and her shrine in detail; the Victorian former custodians&#x27; house has also been converted to house a museum of the pilgrimage. The site is managed by Cadw.

St Winefride&#x27;s Holy Well at Holywell Farm in Cheshire is one of a number of holy wells dedicated to St Winefride which were placed to mark the route of her remains when they were taken from Holywell in Clwyd, where she was martyred, to Shrewsbury Abbey. It is a listed monument.
Another well named after St. Winifred is found in the hamlet of Woolston near Oswestry in Shropshire. According to legend, it is thought that on her way to Shrewsbury Abbey, Winifred&#x27;s body was laid there overnight and a spring sprang up out of the ground. The well is covered by a 15th-century half-timbered cottage. The water flows through a series of stone troughs and into a large pond, which then flows into a stream. The cottage is maintained by the Landmark Trust.

A spring on Lansdown Hill, Bath was known as St. Winifred&#x27;s Spring and gave its name to nearby Winifreds Lane. There appears to be no known connection to the life of the saint, but its waters were once supposed to help women conceive.

A Norman church of Saint Winifred&#x27;s can be found in the village of Branscombe, Devon. There is some archaeological evidence to suggest an earlier Saxon church may have occupied the site.

===&quot;Roman Martyrology&quot;===
In the 2004 edition of the &quot;Roman Martyrology&quot;, Winifred is listed under 2 November with the Latin name . She is listed as follows: &quot;At the spring located at Holywell in Wales, St Winefride the Virgin, who is outstanding in her witness as a nun&quot;. Winifred is officially recognised by the Vatican as a person with a historical basis, who lived an exemplary religious life, but with no discussion of miracles which she may have performed or been healed by. As a 1st-millennium saint, she is recognised as a saint by popular acclaim, rather than ever being formally canonized.

In the current Roman Catholic liturgical calendar for Wales, Winifred is commemorated on 3 November, since 2 November is designated as All Souls&#x27; Day.

===Iconography===
Winifred&#x27;s representation in stained glass at Llandyrnog and Llanasa focuses on her learning and her status as an honorary martyr, but the third aspect of her life, her religious leadership, is also commemorated visually. On the seal of the cathedral chapter of St. Asaph (now in the National Museums and Galleries of Wales, Cathays Park, Cardiff), she appears wimpled as an abbess, bearing a crozier, symbol of leadership and authority and a reliquary.

=== Feast days ===

* 22 (24) June - death anniversary,
* 30 October - feast day in Ireland
* 2 November - Roman Martyrology
* 3 November - feast day in England and Wales

==References in fiction==
St. Winifred&#x27;s Well, termed , is mentioned in the medieval poem &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; (in Passus II). She also appears as a character in the 2021 film adaptation of the poem, portrayed by actress Erin Kellyman.

William Rowley&#x27;s 17th-century comedy &quot;A Shoemaker a Gentleman&quot; dramatises St. Winifred&#x27;s story, based on the version in Thomas Deloney&#x27;s story &quot;The Gentle Craft&quot; (1584).

English poet Gerard Manley Hopkins memorialised St. Winifred in his unfinished drama, &quot;St Winifred&#x27;s Well&quot;.

The moving of Winifred&#x27;s bones to Shrewsbury is fictionalised in &quot;A Morbid Taste for Bones&quot;, the first of Ellis Peters&#x27; Brother Cadfael novels, with the plot twist that her bones are secretly left in Wales, and someone else is put into the shrine; St. Winifred is portrayed as an important character in all the books in the Brother Cadfael series. The celebration of her Feast Day provides the setting for two of the novels, &quot;The Rose Rent&quot; and &quot;The Pilgrim of Hate&quot;. The casket is stolen from its shrine in &quot;The Holy Thief&quot;, and the campaign to find and restore it propels the action. Throughout the series, the protagonist, Brother Cadfael - a Welsh monk at the English monastery at Shrewsbury - develops a &quot;special understanding&quot; with the saint, whom he affectionately calls &quot;The Girl&quot;.

Australian novelist Gerald Murnane makes reference to St. Winifred in his novel &quot;Inland.&quot;

St. Winifred appears as a spirit to Sir Gawain in the 2021 movie &quot;The Green Knight.&quot; Winifred asks Sir Gawain to retrieve her severed head from a spring, which he does. He places the head in her bed with the rest of her skeletal remains, and she provides him with information regarding the identity of the Green Knight.

==Legacy==
A bronze statue of St. Winifred by George Edwin Bissell stands on Promenade Hill overlooking the Hudson River in Hudson, New York. It was presented to the city in 1896 by John Watts de Peyster. The statue had originally been planned as a fountain for the Watts de Peyster Hospital and Invalid Children&#x27;s Home at Madalin, operated by the Women&#x27;s Board of Domestic Missions of the Methodist Church, but the board found it couldn&#x27;t spare the water.

<doc id="676038" wikidata="Q605226" url="?curid=676038" title="Short Cuts">
<text>Short Cuts is a 1993 American comedy-drama film, directed by Robert Altman. Filmed from a screenplay by Altman and Frank Barhydt, it is inspired by nine short stories and a poem by Raymond Carver. The film is set in Los Angeles, in contrast to the original Pacific Northwest backdrop of Carver&#x27;s stories. &quot;Short Cuts&quot; traces the actions of 22 principal characters, both in parallel and at occasional loose points of connection.

The film features an ensemble cast including Matthew Modine, Julianne Moore, Fred Ward, Anne Archer, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Robert Downey Jr., Madeleine Stowe, Chris Penn, Jack Lemmon, Frances McDormand, Lori Singer, Andie MacDowell, Buck Henry, Lily Tomlin, actress and singer Annie Ross, and musicians Huey Lewis, Lyle Lovett, and Tom Waits.

==Plot==
The film begins with a fleet of helicopters spraying for medflies, which brings various characters together along the flight path.

Dr. Ralph Wyman and his wife, Marian, meet Stuart Kane, an unemployed salesman, and Claire Kane, a party clown, at a concert Zoe Trainer performs on cello. They impulsively decide to have a Sunday dinner date. Meanwhile, Marian&#x27;s sister, Sherri, is married to a cheating cop named Gene, who is having an affair with Betty Weathers, while Betty is divorcing one of the helicopter pilots, Stormy.

Among the other characters are Doreen Piggot, a waitress married to an alcoholic limo driver named Earl, and television commentator Howard Finnigan, who lives next door to cabaret singer Tess and her daughter Zoe. Jerry Kaiser, the pool cleaner, is married to Lois, who works from home as a phone sex operator. Jerry and Lois are friends with Honey, Doreen&#x27;s daughter, and her husband Bill, a makeup artist.

Tragedy strikes when Casey, Howard and Anne&#x27;s young son, is accidentally hit by Doreen&#x27;s car. Although he initially seems fine, Casey later falls unconscious at home. The concerned parents rush him to the hospital, where he remains comatose. In the midst of this, the baker Andy Bitkower repeatedly calls the Finnigans to inform them about their ordered cake. However, Howard, wanting to keep the phone line free, abruptly ends the calls, leading to frustration on Andy&#x27;s part.

Howard&#x27;s estranged father, Paul, arrives at the hospital and recalls an incident from Howard&#x27;s childhood, which caused the rift between them. Meanwhile, Stuart and his friends, Gordon and Vern, harass Doreen at the diner before leaving for a fishing trip. During their excursion, they discover the body of a young woman. Contemplating what to do, they decide to tie her to the rocks and continue fishing, only reporting the incident later. Stuart eventually confesses to Claire, who is appalled by their actions and visits the funeral home out of guilt.

Stormy, one of the helicopter pilots, pays a destructive visit to Betty&#x27;s house while she is away with their son. Gene abandons the family dog due to its barking, but eventually retrieves it after his children express distress. The Wymans have a heated argument before their dinner party with the Kanes, during which Marian admits to having an affair. Both couples resort to heavy drinking, and the party lasts throughout the night.

A glimmer of hope arises when Casey&#x27;s eyes flutter, but tragically, he suddenly dies, leaving Howard and Anne devastated. Meanwhile, Zoe, overwhelmed by her mother&#x27;s alcoholism, Casey&#x27;s death, and her own isolation, commits suicide by starting her car engine inside the garage. Her mother discovers her lifeless body and drinks herself into a stupor.

When Honey picks up pictures from the fotomat, she finds them mixed up with Gordon&#x27;s. Honey is shocked to find pictures of the submerged body from Gordon&#x27;s fishing trip while Gordon equally shocked to find pictures of Honey appearing severely beaten. Disturbed, they part ways but memorize each other&#x27;s license plates. Later, at a picnic, Jerry and Bill encounter two young women they had met earlier. Bill and one of the girls walk away, only to hear her scream moments before Jerry kills her with a rock. Suddenly, a major earthquake strikes, causing chaos. The aftermath suggests that Jerry&#x27;s act may be mistakenly attributed to the falling rocks during the earthquake.

==Cast==
==Production==
According to associate producer Mike Kaplan, the screenplay was first written in 1989. Filming primarily took place in Los Angeles, California. Principal photography began on July 26, 1992, and ended on October 1, 1992.

==Release==
The film was distributed by Fine Line Features and released in the United States on October 3, 1993. 
A special DVD edition was released by the Criterion Collection in 2004 and contains two discs, the collection of Carver&#x27;s short stories, and an essay booklet on the film.

==Reception==
&quot;Short Cuts&quot; received critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 95% approval rating, based on 60 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Robert Altman&#x27;s ensemble drama deftly integrates its disparate characters and episodes into a funny, poignant, emotionally satisfying whole.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 81 out of 100, based on 22 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars and wrote: &quot;Los Angeles always seems to be waiting for something. Permanence seems out of reach; some great apocalyptic event is on the horizon, and people view the future tentatively. Robert Altman&#x27;s &#x27;Short Cuts&#x27; captures that uneasiness perfectly in its interlocking stories about people who seem trapped in the present, always juggling.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;The lives are often desperate and the characters inarticulate, but the group portrait is as grandly, sometimes as hilariously, realized as anything the director has ever done.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film four out of four stars and called it &quot;a brilliant companion piece&quot; to &quot;The Player&quot;. Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;is not equally involving all the time. Some performances are stronger than others, some situations more entertaining, and some choices Altman has made, like an overreliance on female nudity that borders on the exploitative, difficult to defend. But whenever interest lags, a look, a moment, a &quot;frisson&quot; of regret will cross the screen and the emotional connection is restored.&quot; Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; panned the film as &quot;a cynical, sexist and shallow work&quot; populated with &quot;whiny, inert and mostly unlikable characters.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Short Cuts&quot; was named one of the best films of 1993 by over 50 film critics. Only &quot;The Piano&quot; and &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; appeared on more lists.

Altman was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director (but lost to Steven Spielberg for &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;) and shared a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay with Barhydt (lost to Steven Zaillian for &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;). The cast won a Special Golden Globe Award for their ensemble acting. The film also won the prestigious Golden Lion and the Volpi Cup for Best Ensemble Cast at the Venice Film Festival.
=== Year-end lists ===
* Top 10 (listed alphabetically, not ranked) – Mike Mayo, &quot;The Roanoke Times&quot;
* No. 1. Peter Travers, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;

* No. 2. Gene Siskel, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;

<text>St Winefride&#x27;s Well () is a holy well and national shrine located in the Welsh town of Holywell in Flintshire. The patron saint of the well, St Winefride, was a 7th-century Catholic martyr who according to legend was decapitated by a lustful prince and then miraculously restored to life. The well is said to have sprung up at the spot where her head hit the ground. This story is first recorded in the 12th century, and since then St Winefride&#x27;s Well has been a popular pilgrimage destination, known for its healing waters. The well is unique among Britain&#x27;s sacred sites in that it retained a continuous pilgrimage tradition throughout the English Reformation.

During the Middle Ages, the well formed part of the estate of nearby Basingwerk Abbey. It was visited by several English monarchs, including Richard II and Henry IV. Following the establishment of the Church of England, attempts were made by the Protestant authorities to prevent Catholic pilgrimage to the well, but these attempts were unsuccessful. From the 18th century onwards, the well increasingly attracted secular tourism, and it was commonly believed that the well-water had natural healing properties by virtue of its mineral content. Two bath-houses were built on the site in 1869. In 1917, the well dried up as a result of mining operations in the Greenfield valley; to get it flowing again, water had to be diverted from a new underground source.

The chapel above the well was built in the 16th century. It is a grade I listed building and a scheduled ancient monument. It comprises two parts, the upper chapel and the well crypt. The upper chapel has seen a variety of uses, including service as a sessions house and a secular day school, but is presently used for religious worship. The well crypt contains a star-shaped basin that encloses the well-spring, and an 18th-century statue of St Winefride. Both sections of the chapel are under state guardianship and managed by Cadw.

The well complex is currently open to visitors, who may bathe in the water at certain times of day or fill water bottles from an outdoor tap. There is a visitors&#x27; centre and museum on the site. Organised group pilgrimages take place several times a year, and during the pilgrimage season, St Winefride&#x27;s relic is venerated daily in the well crypt.

==Legend of St Winefride==
The story of St Winefride, the 7th-century martyr for whom the well is named, is told in two 12th-century &quot;Lives&quot;: one written by Robert Pennant, prior of Shrewsbury Abbey, and a shorter work of unknown authorship, known as the &quot;Vita Prima&quot;. Both works tell substantially the same story of the origin of the well.

Winefride is said to have been the daughter of Teuyth, a chieftain of Tegeingl, who had permitted St Beuno to establish a church within his territory. Beuno became Winefride&#x27;s religious instructor (later iterations of the story make him Winefride&#x27;s uncle), and at an early age she took a vow of chastity, intending to devote her life to God. One Sunday morning, while her parents were at Mass, a prince named Caradoc visited their home. Finding Winefride alone, he tried to convince her to sleep with him, threatening to take her by force if she refused. Winefride pretended to consent, only asking that she first be allowed to retire to her room to get changed. By this ruse she managed to escape the house and fled down the valley towards Beuno&#x27;s church. As she reached it, Caradoc caught up with her and decapitated her with his sword. Her body fell outside the church door, but her head landed inside the threshold, and where it landed, a spring burst forth from the earth. 

Beuno came forward and pronounced a curse on Caradoc, who was instantly struck dead. Then Beuno placed Winefride&#x27;s head back onto her body and prayed for her revival. The prayer was granted and Winefride returned to life, the only trace of her injury being a thin white line around her neck. The two 12th-century sources give differing accounts of her later life, but both agree that she took command of an abbey in Gwytherin, where she eventually died and was buried.

==History of the well==
===Early history===
It is not known how long the well has been associated with St Winefride. A fragment of a wooden reliquary from Gwytherin (known as the Arch Gwenfrewi) provides evidence that Winefride was venerated as a saint in the mid-8th century, but the earliest reference to a church in Holywell (which also marks the first time that the town is referred to by that name) is in a document dated 1093, in which the wife of the 1st Earl of Chester grants &quot;the churche of Haliwel&quot; to the monks of St Werburgh&#x27;s Abbey. It appears that the cult of St Winefride had at this time not achieved any great notoriety, since the medieval historian Giraldus Cambrensis, who visited the area in 1188, does not mention Winefride or the well, and she is also not included in the 12th-century Calendar of Welsh Saints in Cotton Vespasian A.xiv.
The grant of the church to St Werburgh&#x27;s was confirmed by Richard d&#x27;Avranches, 2nd Earl of Chester, in 1119, but in 1135, the town and church of Holywell were given into the possession of the newly-established Basingwerk Abbey in Flintshire. The church was briefly transferred back to St Werbergh&#x27;s between 1157 and 1196, but then reverted to Basingwerk.

During the late Middle Ages the fame of St Winefride began to spread, as the growth of Marian culture in Europe caused a surge of interest in female saints. One focal point of Winefride&#x27;s cult was Shrewsbury Abbey, which had taken possession of the saint&#x27;s remains in 1137, but Holywell also received large numbers of pilgrims, who came to offer their devotions and to take advantage of the reputed healing power of the water.
Among the pilgrims were several English monarchs. The first known royal visit to the well was that of Richard II in 1398. Richard appointed a chaplain to say regular masses at the well; the office came with an annual pension which was kept up by successive monarchs until the 16th century. Henry IV took a pilgrimage to the well in 1403, following his victory at the Battle of Shrewsbury, possibly in order to give thanks to Winefride for saving the life of his son, who had sustained an arrow wound during the battle. On the other hand, Henry&#x27;s visit may have been politically motivated; by moving north he was positioning himself to head off a potential Welsh invasion, and his devotions at the well sent a message to the people of Cheshire (an area hostile to his rule) that the saint endorsed his victory. Henry seems to have established the first chapel over the well, which is described as having had three strong walls and a &quot;great gate&quot; on the fourth side.

Henry V may have made a pilgrimage from Shrewsbury to Holywell sometime around 1416, though the documentary evidence is ambiguous. The medieval Welsh poet Tudur Aled said of St Winefride&#x27;s Well that &quot;every earl used to go, every courtier, every king&quot;, and mentions a pilgrimage to the site by Edward IV. Though the poem gives no indication of the date of this pilgrimage, Edward was active in the area in 1461, around the time of his crowning; like Henry before him, he may have wished to secure a political advantage by showing that Winefride supported his cause.

The chapel built by Henry IV apparently did not survive for long, possibly because it was not sturdy enough to withstand the force of the water. The chapel that stands on the site today is traditionally said to have been built by Margaret Beaufort, mother of Henry VII, shortly after the 1485 Battle of Bosworth, but there is no contemporary evidence to support this claim. A 16th-century poem by Siôn ap Hywel says that the funding for the chapel was provided by Abbot Thomas Pennant of Basingwerk in 1512, and modern historians consider this a more plausible account. Tree-ring dating of one of the building&#x27;s principal rafters has shown that the roof timbers were likely put in place around 1525.

===English Reformation===
In 1534, Henry VIII officially rejected the authority of the Pope and established the Church of England, an act that dramatically altered the nation&#x27;s religious landscape. Catholicism was outlawed, and traditional practices such as pilgrimage and the veneration of saints were condemned as heretical. Despite this, St Winefride&#x27;s Well continued to attract large numbers of Catholic pilgrims throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. The well&#x27;s uninterrupted pilgrimage tradition makes it unique among the sacred sites of Britain.

Basingwerk Abbey was dissolved circa 1537. The abbey&#x27;s possessions reverted to the Crown, and St Winefride&#x27;s Well was leased out to a member of the royal household, who in turn leased it to one William Holcroft. The terms of the lease entitled Holcroft to receive all donations offered by pilgrims at the shrine, but he soon came into conflict with a group of local Catholics, who brought their own donation boxes to the well and urged the pilgrims not to give their money to a servant of the king. The zeal of the locals helped protect the well chapel from the organized iconoclasm of the following decades, and the income generated by the site gave the authorities good reason not to suppress its operation.

However, anti-Catholic laws were more rigorously enforced during the reign of Elizabeth I, after the papal bull commanded English Catholics to rebel against their monarch. Any large gathering of Catholics was henceforth considered a threat to national security; notwithstanding this, the well&#x27;s popularity as a pilgrimage site was undiminished. In 1579, Elizabeth ordered that the water be tested to determine if it had any natural curative properties. If so, access was to be restricted only to &quot;diseased persons&quot;; if not, then the chapel was to be torn down. It is unknown what resulted from this order, but the chapel remained standing and pilgrimage continued. In 1590, the Society of Jesus dispatched John Bennett to minister to Catholics in Holywell, and the Jesuits maintained a presence in the town up until the 20th century.

===17th century===
In 1605, under the reign of James I, the Jesuit Henry Garnet led a pilgrimage from Enfield to St Winefride&#x27;s Well, stopping along the way at the homes of several people who were later implicated in the Gunpowder Plot. Garnet was accused of using the pilgrimage as cover for a &quot;conference of the conspirators&quot;, though modern historians consider this unlikely. The backlash against the failed plot resulted in even greater legal intolerance of Catholics and sharper punishments for recusancy (refusal to attend Anglican services). Catholics were required to take an Oath of Allegiance which denied the authority of the Pope over the king.

In 1617, Bishop Richard Parry made an effort to prevent the &quot;superstitious flocking&quot; of Catholics to St Winefride&#x27;s Well by requiring &quot;that the oath of supremacie and allegiance be ordered unto all such strangers (before they go to the Well) as shall refuse to come to church, by which reason whereof the great concourse is stopped&quot;. If Parry did succeed in keeping pilgrims from the well, his victory was short-lived. Just three years later, a Catholic source reported that the Bishop of Bangor, Lewis Bayly, &quot;went in person to arrest the priests and Catholics&quot; who were visiting the well around the time of Winefride&#x27;s feast day, whereupon &quot;the people from about the countryside rose up, even though most of them are heretics [Protestants] and seized the bishop and handled him roughly and then threw him into a ditch&quot;.

In 1626, Chief Justice of Chester John Bridgeman undertook to solve the problem of St Winefride&#x27;s. He ordered local innkeepers to pass the names of their guests on to the authorities, and summoned all recusants to take the Oath of Allegiance in court. Before the year was out, he confidently reported that pilgrimage to the well had ceased. Once again, however, this success was only temporary. On 3 November 1629, a crowd of 1,400 &quot;knights, ladies, gentlemen and gentlewomen of divers countries&quot;, along with an estimated 150 Catholic priests, gathered at the well to celebrate St Winefride&#x27;s feast day. The Bishop of St Asaph, in his annual reports to the Archbishop of Canterbury, repeatedly complained about the number of people visiting the well, until in 1637 John Bridgeman returned to the fray. This time, he instituted more extreme measures to stem the tide of pilgrimage. All but two of the inns at Holywell were closed, the statue of Winefride in the shrine was disfigured, the iron posts around the spring for the support of the bathers were removed, and orders were given to report the names and addresses of every pilgrim. Bridgeman also suggested building a wall to block access to the well-basin; it is unknown whether he actually attempted this, but the columns of the basin exhibit signs of damage that may be consistent with such an attempt. Further damage to the chapel occurred during the English Civil War, possibly by the Parliamentary soldiers who passed through Holywell in November 1643.

Not all Protestants denied the efficacy of healing wells, though they did not believe the cures to be effected by any supernatural agency. Medicinal spas had become popular during the Elizabethan era, and 17th-century physicians sought to prove that certain springs could provide powerful health benefits on account of the mineral content of the water. There are many recorded visits to St Winefride&#x27;s Well by Protestants, with at least one having received permission from his parish priest to make the journey. Contemporary Catholic sources report several miraculous cures and conversions of Protestants at the well.

The accession to the throne in 1685 of the Catholic James II brought a brief period of respite to the persecuted pilgrims. James&#x27;s wife, Mary of Modena, settled a debate between the Jesuits and the secular clergy at Holywell by giving the well chapel into the sole possession of the Jesuits. James visited the well in August 1687 to pray for a son, and donated £30 for the repair of the upper chapel, which until that time was being used as a sessions house. The following year, however, James was deposed by William and Mary, and England once again became a Protestant country.

===18th century to present===
During the 18th century, St Winefride&#x27;s Well was increasingly frequented not only by pilgrims but also by tourists and curiosity seekers. Travel was becoming easier, and newspapers and pamphlets were spreading the word about the well and its healing waters. The well became an essential stop on the tourist itinerary; among those who visited were Celia Fiennes, Daniel Defoe and Samuel Johnson. The secularization of holy wells continued, with cures being attributed to the chemical composition of the water rather than to the intervention of the patron saint. In 1722, the upper chapel was converted into a day school. In 1795, the antiquary Thomas Pennant noted that the number of Catholic pilgrims visiting the well had &quot;considerably decreased&quot;.

This was to change in 1805, when a dramatic and heavily-publicized cure sparked a revival of interest. A young woman named Winefrid White, who for years had been paralyzed down the left side and unable to walk without a crutch, bathed in St Winefride&#x27;s Well and made an immediate recovery. Bishop John Milner published an account of the incident, in which he collated the testimonies of multiple witnesses and described the event as an &quot;evident miracle&quot; which defied scientific explanation. This public affirmation of the miraculous power of the well, helped along by the growing Romantic fascination with medieval history, reignited Holywell&#x27;s pilgrimage tradition. The upper chapel was once again used for religious services from 1841.
In 1859, it was discovered that the foundations of the chapel had eroded away, and the building was in a dangerous condition. The water was diverted for several days while workmen underpinned the well pool with ashlar stone and flagged the plunge bath. In 1869, work began on the construction of two new buildings in the vicinity of the well. The first, called the Well House, was a three-storey bath-house which doubled as the caretaker&#x27;s residence; the second was a swimming pool called the Westminster Bath. These buildings were completed by April 1871. A turnstile was installed at the entrance to the well complex, and a fee was charged for admittance. In 1886, a statue of St Winefride was placed in the niche at the entrance to the well, which had stood empty since the 1630s.

On 5 January 1917, St Winefride&#x27;s Well ran dry. The water supply had been tapped by a drainage tunnel that was under construction near Bagillt. It had already been observed in 1885 that the drainage schemes connected with the lead mining operations in the Greenfield valley were affecting the output of the well, but the concerns of Holywell residents had been overridden. After the well dried up completely, the search began for an alternative source. A disused mine shaft northwest of Holywell was converted into a pumping plant, which was used to raise an underground water supply and divert it along a drainage tunnel known as the Holway Level. Water was then piped from this tunnel into the well basin. The well began to flow again on 22 September, and there was no indication that the water had lost any of its curative powers.

In 1930, the first section of the stream that issues from the plunge bath was covered over, and the former brewery that stood beside the stream was demolished. The site was landscaped into a garden called St Winefride&#x27;s Park. In the 1990s, the Well House was transformed into a museum and library, and the Westminster Bath into a visitors&#x27; centre. In 2010, the guardianship of the well crypt was transferred to Cadw (who had already been responsible for the maintenance of the upper chapel since the mid-20th century). Restoration work was carried out in the crypt which involved strengthening the masonry, replacing missing flooring slabs, and repairing damage caused by humidity, candle-smoke and fires. New gates and railings were also erected.

The site was designated a national shrine in November 2023.

==Miracles==
Numerous miracles have been attributed to the well, from the 12th century down to the present day. The two earliest &quot;Lives&quot; contain lengthy accounts of miraculous cures which came about through Winefride&#x27;s intercession, and of punishments visited upon those who violated the sanctity of the site. A list of supposed miracles occurring in the 17th century was compiled by the Jesuit priest Philip Metcalf, and an account of 18th- and 19th-century miracles was provided by Charles De Smedt. A further update, including 20th-century cures, was written by Herbert Thurston in 1922. Until the 1960s, crutches and surgical boots left behind by pilgrims were arranged around the well or hung up on the walls; some of these crutches are now on display in the visitors&#x27; centre.

==Devotional practices==

St Winefride&#x27;s Well remains a popular pilgrimage destination, and its long association with healing has earned Holywell the title of &quot;the Lourdes of Wales&quot;. The traditional method of bathing in the well is to pass three times through the small pool adjacent to the spring while reciting one decade of the Rosary, and then to move into the outer pool and kneel on a submerged stone, known as St Beuno&#x27;s stone, for as long as it takes to complete the prayer. 18th-century visitors also reported a tradition of ducking one&#x27;s head under the water to kiss St Beuno&#x27;s stone and make a wish. The ritual of the triple immersion has its origin in Robert of Shrewsbury&#x27;s &quot;Life of Winefride&quot;, in which Beuno prophesies to Winefride as follows:

A 1670 drawing of the chapel shows a small structure to one side of the main spring, labelled &quot;The Little Spring for the cure of sore eyes&quot;. Thomas Pennant, writing in 1796, described the ritual connected with this spring: &quot;The patient made an offering to the nymph of the spring, of a crooked pin, and sent up at the same time a certain ejaculation, by way of charm: but the charm is forgotten, and the efficacy of the waters lost.&quot; The site of the Little Spring is now buried beneath the Well House.

Today, the well is open to the public, but bathing is permitted only at certain times. Filtered well-water is available from a tap; historically, the water has been thought to retain its potency even when removed from the site. The museum within the complex exhibits a piece of the True Cross along with the relics of various saints, including the surviving fragment of the Arch Gwenfrewi and a piece of bone believed to be Winefride&#x27;s.

Organised group pilgrimages take place several times a year. The most popular of these is the June pilgrimage, which involves a procession from the nearby St Winefride&#x27;s Church to the well, a Mass in the well garden given by the Bishop of Wrexham, and the veneration of Winefride&#x27;s relic. During the pilgrimage season (from Pentecost to the last Sunday in September), there is a daily service in the well crypt. An annual Orthodox pilgrimage has also taken place each October since 1987.

==Natural features==

The spring feeding St Winefride&#x27;s Well was once much stronger than it is today. In the late Medieval period, it was said that anything dropped into the well would be carried away downstream before it had time to sink. The poet John Taylor wrote in 1652 that the well &quot;doth continually work and bubble with extreme violence, like a boiling cauldron or furnace&quot;. In 1731, a group of Anglican visitors measured the time it took for the well basin to fill, and concluded that the spring &quot;raises more than one hundred tons of water in a minute&quot;. This estimate matches that recorded by Samuel Johnson in his diary when he passed through the area in 1774:

In 1859, the draining of the well basin for repair work gave another opportunity of measuring the power of the spring. On this occasion, the reported output was 22½ tons per minute. In the modern day, the spring is still said to yield an unusually large quantity of water. A pile of stones has been placed over its point of emergence to prevent it from becoming a fountain.

In former times the bed of the stream was littered with red stones, which according to legend were permanently stained with Winefride&#x27;s blood. The actual cause of the stones&#x27; colour may have been natural iron deposits in the water, or the presence of a red-coloured algae, &quot;Trentepohlia jolithus&quot;, which can still be seen growing on the north wall today. The well was also known for its moss, which reportedly had a sweet smell and was referred to as &quot;St Winefride&#x27;s hair&quot;. The stones and the moss were commonly taken from the site by pilgrims, who treated them as charms or relics. One sceptical visitor, Celia Fiennes, claimed in 1698 that the well&#x27;s custodians replenished the moss daily from a nearby hill.

==Architecture of the chapel==

The well chapel is a grade I listed building (designated 1951) and a scheduled ancient monument. It comprises two parts: the upper chapel, where church services are held, and the well crypt beneath it, which encloses the spring. The hillside has been cut away so that the crypt can be entered from the north, while the upper chapel is entered from the south.

The building is in the Perpendicular style. Its exterior walls are of coursed sandstone, which was imported from the Wirral towns of Storeton and Bebington. It has a low-pitched roof with a crenellated parapet. The upper chapel comprises a four-bay nave, a three-bay north aisle, and a semi-octagonal chancel, with window tracery featuring a mix of basket arches and ogee arches. There is a narrow stone bench around the chancel interior, and sockets in the stonework which suggest that a rood screen was once installed in the chancel arch. The roof is arch-braced and decorated with foliage bosses. The corbels supporting the braces and the arches of the north arcade are carved into a variety of figures, including animals, grotesques, and family emblems.

An external staircase at the west end of the chapel (now blocked) leads down into a gallery that overlooks the well crypt, and then down into the crypt itself through a spandrelled doorway that was once the principal entrance. There are two more doorways in the north wall of the crypt, surmounted by large unglazed windows. Another unglazed window, stretching nearly the entire height of the crypt, sits between them, looking out onto the plunge pool. A band of carved animals runs along the outer wall. The crypt&#x27;s interior is centred around the star-shaped well basin, which supports a ring of stone columns. The columns were once linked by traceried screens, with basket-arched openings providing a view of the spring. Above the spring is a tierceron vault, with a pendant boss that displays six scenes from the life of St Winefride. The vaulted ceiling of the crypt contains many other carved bosses representing various subjects. In the northeast corner is a niche with a crocketed canopy, which holds a statue of St Winefride.

<text>In the Line of Fire is a 1993 American political action thriller film directed by Wolfgang Petersen and starring Clint Eastwood, John Malkovich and Rene Russo. Written by Jeff Maguire, the film is about a disillusioned and obsessed former CIA agent who plans to assassinate the President of the United States and the Secret Service agent who is tracking him. Eastwood&#x27;s character is the sole remaining active-duty Secret Service agent from the detail that was guarding John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas at the time of his assassination in 1963. The film also stars Dylan McDermott, Gary Cole, John Mahoney, and Fred Dalton Thompson.

&quot;In the Line of Fire&quot; was co-produced by Columbia Pictures and Castle Rock Entertainment, with Columbia handling distribution. The film was a critical and commercial success. It grossed $187 million against a $40 million production budget and earned three nominations at the 66th Academy Awards.

==Plot==
Frank Horrigan and Al D&#x27;Andrea meet with members of a counterfeiting group at a marina. The group&#x27;s leader, Mendoza, tells Horrigan that he has identified D&#x27;Andrea as an undercover agent, and forces Horrigan to prove his loyalty by putting a gun to D&#x27;Andrea&#x27;s head and pulling the trigger. When the gun just clicks, Horrigan then shoots and kills Mendoza&#x27;s men, identifies himself as a United States Secret Service agent, and arrests Mendoza.

Horrigan investigates a complaint from a landlady about an apartment&#x27;s absent tenant, Joseph McCrawley. He finds a collage of photographs and newspaper articles on famous assassinations, a model-building magazine, and a &quot;Time&quot; cover with the President&#x27;s head, on which a gunsight-crosshairs has been drawn in red marker. When Horrigan and partner D&#x27;Andrea return with a search warrant, only one photograph remains, which shows a much younger Horrigan (with his face circled in red) standing behind John F. Kennedy in Dallas in 1963, on the day Kennedy is assassinated. Horrigan is the only remaining active agent who was guarding the President that day, and is wracked with guilt over his failure to react quickly enough to the first shot to shield Kennedy from the subsequent fatal bullet. The guilt drove Horrigan to drink excessively, and his family left him.

Horrigan receives a phone call from McCrawley, who calls himself &quot;Booth&quot;. He tells Horrigan that, like John Wilkes Booth and Lee Harvey Oswald, he plans to kill the President of the United States, who is running for reelection and is making many public appearances around the country. Horrigan, despite his age, asks to return to the Presidential Protective Division, where he begins a relationship with fellow agent Lilly Raines.

Booth continues to call Horrigan as part of his &quot;game&quot;, even though he knows that his calls are being traced. He mocks Horrigan&#x27;s failure to protect Kennedy but calls him a &quot;friend&quot;. Booth escapes Horrigan and D&#x27;Andrea after one such call from Lafayette Park, but inadvertently leaves a palm print on a passing car. The Federal Bureau of Investigation matches the print, but because the person&#x27;s identity is classified, the agency cannot disclose it to the Secret Service. The FBI does notify the Central Intelligence Agency.

At a campaign event in Chicago, Booth pops a decorative balloon. Horrigan, who is groggy with the flu, mistakes the pop for a gunshot and over-reacts. Because of the error, he is removed from the protective detail by White House Chief of Staff Harry Sargent and head of security detail Bill Watts, but retains the Booth case. Horrigan and D&#x27;Andrea follow a lead from the model-building magazine to a Phoenix home belonging to Mitch Leary; upon entering, the two agents subdue an unknown individual, revealed to be a CIA agent working with Leary&#x27;s associate. The CIA reveals that Leary is a former agency assassin who has suffered a mental breakdown and is now a &quot;predator&quot; seeking revenge on his former masters. Leary, who has already killed several people as he prepares for the assassination, uses his model-making skills to mould a zip gun out of composite material to evade metal detectors.

D&#x27;Andrea confides to Horrigan that he is going to retire immediately because of nightmares about the Mendoza incident, but Horrigan dissuades him from doing so. After Leary taunts Horrigan about the President facing danger in California, Horrigan and D&#x27; Andrea chase him across Washington rooftops, where Leary shoots and kills D&#x27;Andrea but saves Horrigan from falling to his death as he clings to the side of the building. Horrigan asks Raines to reassign him to the protective detail when the President visits Los Angeles, but a television crew films him mistaking a bellboy at the hotel for a security threat, and Watts and Sargent again force Horrigan to leave the detail.

Horrigan connects Leary to a bank employee&#x27;s murder and determines that Leary, who has made several large campaign contributions, is among the guests at a campaign dinner at the hotel. He sees the President approaching Leary and jumps into the path of the assassin&#x27;s bullet, saving the President&#x27;s life. As the Secret Service quickly removes the President, Leary uses Horrigan—who is wearing a bulletproof vest—as a hostage to escape in the hotel&#x27;s glass elevator. Horrigan uses his earpiece to tell Raines and sharpshooters where to aim; although they miss Leary, Horrigan defeats him, leaving him hanging from the edge. Though Horrigan offers to pull him up to safety, he declares that he would only save him because it&#x27;s his job, and Leary ultimately commits suicide by letting go and falling to his death.

Upon returning home to Washington, and now a widely publicized hero, Horrigan announces his retirement. Horrigan shows Raines into his apartment, where an unexpected farewell message from Leary is found on Horrigan&#x27;s answering machine. They play the message, in which Leary begins to commend Horrigan on his character, but Horrigan and Raines leave the apartment before the message ends. The film ends with Horrigan and Raines enjoying a romantic interlude at the Lincoln Memorial, where they had previously shared a moment together.

==Cast==
==Production==
Producer Jeff Apple began developing &quot;In the Line of Fire&quot; in the mid-1980s. He had planned on making a movie about a Secret Service Agent on detail during the Kennedy assassination since his boyhood. Apple was inspired and intrigued by a vivid early childhood memory of meeting Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson in person, surrounded by Secret Service Agents with earpieces in dark suits and sunglasses. The concept later struck Apple as an adolescent watching televised replays of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

After another writer&#x27;s efforts fell short, Jeff Maguire came aboard in 1991 and completed the script that would become the movie. Disney rejected a treatment for TV starring Tom Selleck, and after a bidding war Castle Rock Entertainment bought the script for $1.4 million in April 1992.

Clint Eastwood and Wolfgang Petersen offered the role of Leary to Robert De Niro, who turned it down due to scheduling conflicts with &quot;A Bronx Tale&quot;.

Filming began in late 1992 in Washington, D.C. Scenes in the White House were filmed on an existing set, while an Air Force One interior set had to be built at a cost of $250,000. The film&#x27;s climactic scenes were shot inside the lobby and elevators of the Los Angeles Bonaventure Hotel, while earlier scenes of Frank and Lilly sharing intimate moments were filmed in the nearby Los Angeles Biltmore Hotel.

A subplot of the film is the President&#x27;s re-election campaign. For the scenes of campaign rallies, the filmmakers used digitally altered footage from the campaign events of President George H. W. Bush and then-Governor Bill Clinton.

The movie also inserted digitized images from 1960s Clint Eastwood movies into the Kennedy assassination scenes. As Jeff Apple described it to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Eastwood &quot;gets the world&#x27;s first digital haircut&quot;.

In an interview with Larry King, President Bill Clinton praised the film. Unsure if this endorsement would help or hurt the film, Petersen decided against using his quotes to market the film.

==Release==
&quot;In the Line of Fire&quot; was released in United States theaters in July 1993. It was one of the first films to have a trailer for the film made available online. Offered via AOL, the trailer was downloaded 170 times in a week and a half.

===Box office===
The film earned $15 million in its opening weekend. It earned over $102 million in North America and $85 million in other territories, for a total of $187,343,874 worldwide, against a budget of approximately $40 million.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;In the Line of Fire&quot; has a 96% rating based on 73 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;A straightforward thriller of the highest order, &quot;In the Line of Fire&quot; benefits from Wolfgang Petersen&#x27;s taut direction and charismatic performances from Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a score of 74 out of 100 based on reviews from 16. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s movie making of the high, smooth, commercial order that Hollywood prides itself on but achieves with singular infrequency.&quot;
Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half out of four, writing: &quot;Most thrillers these days are about stunts and action. &quot;In the Line of Fire&quot; has a mind.&quot;

Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film &quot;crisply entertaining&quot;. He praised the casting, &quot;Malkovich’s insinuating, carefully thought out delivery is in the same way an ideal foil for Eastwood’s bluntly straightforward habits&quot;, and Eastwood &quot;every part of this film trades so heavily on Eastwood’s presence that it is impossible to imagine it with anyone else in the starring role&quot;.

<doc id="676060" wikidata="Q304828" url="?curid=676060" title="Macdonald Carey">
<text>Edward Macdonald Carey (March 15, 1913 – March 21, 1994) was an American actor, best known for his role as the patriarch Dr. Tom Horton on NBC&#x27;s soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. For almost three decades, he was the show&#x27;s central cast member.

He first made his career starring in various B-movies of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s (with a few A-picture exceptions like Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot;). He was known in many Hollywood circles as &quot;King of the Bs&quot;, sharing the throne with his &quot;queen&quot;, Lucille Ball.

==Early life==
Born in Sioux City, Iowa, Carey graduated from the University of Iowa in Iowa City with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1935, after attending the University of Wisconsin–Madison for a year where he was a member of Alpha Delta Phi. He became involved with the drama school at the University of Iowa and decided to become an actor.

==Career==
===Radio and Broadway===
Carey toured with the Globe Players. He began to work steadily on radio, including playing Dick Grosvenor on the soap opera &quot;Stella Dallas&quot; and Ridgeway Tearle in &quot;John&#x27;s Other Wife&quot;, both in the early 1940s. He was also in &quot;Lights Out&quot;.

Carey was on Broadway in &quot;Lady in the Dark&quot; (1941) opposite Gertrude Lawrence, Danny Kaye and Victor Mature. His performance led to him receiving a contract offer from Paramount. He later recalled, &quot;1941 was probably the greatest year of my life. I got my first big hit with Lady in the Dark, I got married and I signed with Paramount Pictures. I only wish I could remember it all better.&quot; The reason was his alcoholism.

===Film appearances and World War II service===
Carey made his film debut in &quot;Star Spangled Rhythm&quot; (1942). Paramount gave him the third lead in &quot;Take a Letter, Darling&quot; (1942), directed by Mitchell Leisen. He followed it with &quot;Dr. Broadway&quot; (1942), which was his first starring role. He had a leading part in &quot;Wake Island&quot; (1942), directed by John Farrow, a big hit.

Carey&#x27;s career received a boost when borrowed by Alfred Hitchcock at Universal to play the romantic lead in &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; (1943) with Joseph Cotten and Teresa Wright. However the momentum was halted when he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. He had two months before he left, which enabled him to star in a musical for Paramount, &quot;Salute for Three&quot; (1943). Carey received his commission in early 1944 and attended fighter director school at Camp Murphy in Orlando, Florida. After school he served with Air Warning Squadron 3 with stints on Espiritu Santo, Bougainville and Mindanao.

In 1947 Carey returned to Paramount. They put him back into leading roles: &quot;Suddenly, It&#x27;s Spring&quot; (1947), directed by Leisen, co-starring Paulette Goddard; &quot;Hazard&quot; (1948), again with Goddard; and &quot;Dream Girl&quot; (1948), supporting Betty Hutton, directed by Leisen.

Carey played Cesare Borgia in &quot;Bride of Vengeance&quot; (1948) alongside Goddard, directed by Leisen, but it was a flop. More popular was a Western, &quot;Streets of Laredo&quot; (1949), but William Holden was the hero; Carey was the villain.

In 1949 he co-starred as &quot;Nick Carraway&quot; in Alan Ladd&#x27;s version of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;. Carey followed this with &quot;Song of Surrender&quot; (1949), once again directed by Leisen.

Universal borrowed Carey for two films: a Western with Maureen O&#x27;Hara, &quot;Comanche Territory&quot; (1950), and &quot;South Sea Sinner&quot; (1950) with Shelley Winters.

Back at Paramount he was in a low budget film noir, &quot;The Lawless&quot; (1950) directed by Joseph Losey. Back at Paramount he was a villain to Ray Milland in &quot;Copper Canyon&quot; (1950), directed by John Farrow. At Paramount he was Jesse James in &quot;The Great Missouri Raid&quot; (1951) and was in &quot;Mystery Submarine&quot; (1950) at Universal.

Carey supported Red Skelton at MGM in &quot;Excuse My Dust&quot; (1951).

At 20th Century Fox Carey supported Betty Grable in &quot;Meet Me After the Show&quot; (1951) and Claudette Colbert in &quot;Let&#x27;s Make It Legal&quot; (1951). He went back to Universal for &quot;Cave of Outlaws&quot; (1951)

He continued to appear in films like &quot;My Wife&#x27;s Best Friend&quot; (1952), at Fox with Anne Baxter; &quot;Count the Hours&quot; (1953), with Teresa Wright at RKO; &quot;Hannah Lee&quot; (1953), a Western with John Ireland; &quot;It&#x27;s Everybody&#x27;s Business&quot; (1953), and &quot;Malaga&quot; (1954) with Maureen O&#x27;Hara.

Later films included &quot;Stranger at My Door&quot; (1956), a Western for Republic Pictures, and &quot;Odongo&quot; (1956) for Warwick Films.

Carey returned to Broadway in &quot;Anniversary Waltz&quot; (1954–55), directed by Moss Hart, which was a big hit and ran for two years.

==Television==
While still a featured player in films, Carey began appearing on television in episodes of &quot;The Christophers&quot;, &quot;Celanese Theatre&quot;, &quot;Hope Chest&quot;, and &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot;. As time went on, Carey&#x27;s work was increasingly on the small screen, including appearances on &quot;The Quiet Gun&quot;, &quot;Stage 7&quot;, &quot;Science Fiction Theatre&quot;, &quot;Hour of Stars&quot;, &quot;Celebrity Playhouse&quot;, and &quot;The 20th Century Fox Hour&quot;, where he appeared as Fred Gaily in a remake of the 1947 film classic, &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot;, starring Teresa Wright and Thomas Mitchell. 

He was also featured on &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, &quot;Screen Directors Playhouse&quot;, &quot;The Alcoa Hour&quot;, and &quot;Climax!&quot;. Carey managed a single, starring turn as a young professor traveling cross-country in the fifth season of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; (&quot;Coyote Moon&quot;) as well.

===Dr. Christian===
In 1956, Carey took over the role of the kindly small-town physician Dr. Christian, a character created in the late 1930s by actor Jean Hersholt on radio and in films. Carey portrayed Dr. Christian on syndicated television for one season.

Carey guested on &quot;The Kaiser Aluminium Hour&quot;, &quot;The Joseph Cotten Show&quot;, &quot;The Jane Wyman Show&quot;, &quot;Zane Grey Theatre&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;Studio One in Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, &quot;The Frank Sinatra Show&quot;, &quot;Suspicion&quot;, &quot;Target&quot;, &quot;Pursuit&quot;, &quot;Schlitz Playhouse&quot;, &quot;The Dupont Show of the Month&quot;, and &quot;Rawhide&quot;.

Carey was in the Western film &quot;Man or Gun&quot; (1958), for Republic. and &quot;The Redeemer&quot; (1959). He played patriot Patrick Henry in &quot;John Paul Jones&quot; (1959), directed by John Farrow who had worked with Carey at Paramount. He appeared in &quot;Blue Denim&quot; (1959).

===&quot;Lock Up&quot;===
Carey starred as crusading Herb Maris in the 1950s syndicated series &quot;Lock-Up&quot;. A total of seventy-eight episodes were made between 1959 and 1961.

Carey guest starred on &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;Moment of Fear&quot;, &quot;Thriller&quot; (&quot;The Devil&#x27;s Ticket&quot;), &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;, &quot;Insight&quot;, &quot;Target&quot;, &quot;Checkmate&quot; and &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;.

Carey went to England to make the films &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Agent&quot; (1962) and &quot;The Damned&quot; (known as &quot;These Are the Damned&quot; in the US) (1963), for director Joseph Losey. He was also in &quot;Stranglehold&quot; (1962),

In the first season of &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, Carey starred in the episode titled &quot;The Special One&quot;. He was also in &quot;The Dick Powell Theatre&quot;, &quot;Kraft Mystery Theatre&quot;, and &quot;Arrest and Trial&quot;,

Carey supported Sandra Dee in &quot;Tammy and the Doctor&quot; (1963). He guest starred in the 1964–1965 sitcom &quot;The Bing Crosby Show&quot; on ABC. He appeared as Mr. Edwards in the 1963 episode &quot;Pay the Two Dollars&quot; of the NBC education drama series, &quot;Mr. Novak&quot;, starring James Franciscus. He could also be seen on &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;, &quot;Branded&quot;, &quot;Kraft Suspense Theatre&quot;, &quot;Run for Your Life&quot;, &quot;Ben Casey&quot;, &quot;Lassie&quot;, and &quot;Bewitched&quot;.

===&quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;===

Carey played Tom Horton on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; from its first episode in 1965. Carey said he took the show &quot;because I couldn&#x27;t get a movie at the time&quot;. He continued as Tom Horton until his death from lung cancer in Beverly Hills, California, in 1994, six days after his 81st birthday.

During this time, Carey suffered from a drinking problem, and eventually joined Alcoholics Anonymous in 1982.

A longtime pipe smoker, he was seen in many films and early episodes of &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; with it. He was ordered by his doctor to quit in September 1991 after having to take a leave of absence from &quot;Days&quot; in order to remove a cancerous tumor from one of his lungs. He returned to the show in November of that year.

He is most recognized today as the voice who recites the epigraph each day before the program begins: &quot;Like sands through the hourglass, so are the &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;.&quot; From 1966 to 1994 he would also intone, &quot;This is Macdonald Carey, and these are the &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;.&quot; (After Carey&#x27;s death, the producers, out of respect for Carey&#x27;s family, decided not to use the second part of the opening tagline.) At each intermission, his voice also says &quot;We will return for the second half of &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; in just a moment&quot;. Since the Horton family is still regarded as the core of &quot;Days of our Lives&quot;, his memory has been allowed to remain imprinted on the show by leaving the voice-overs intact. He also served as voice-over for the very first PBS ident, in which he said &quot;This is PBS ... the Public Broadcasting Service.&quot;

==Other appearances==
Carey continued to act in other productions during his run on &quot;Days&quot;. He had roles in &quot;Gidget Gets Married&quot; (1972), &quot;The Magician&quot;, &quot;Ordeal&quot; (1973), &quot;Owen Marshall, Counsellor at Law&quot;, &quot;Who Is the Black Dahlia?&quot; (1975), &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot;, &quot;Police Story&quot;, &quot;Switch&quot;, &quot;The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; and &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot;.

He later appeared in many all-star television miniseries, such as &quot;Roots&quot;, &quot;The Rebels&quot;, &quot;The Top of the Hill&quot; and &quot;Condominium&quot;.

He was in the films &quot;Foes&quot; (1977), &quot;End of the World&quot; (1977), and &quot;Summer of Fear&quot; (1978), and had a small part in &quot;American Gigolo&quot; (1980).

Carey was in the TV movie &quot;The Girl, the Gold Watch &amp; Everything&quot; (1980) and the films &quot;Access Code&quot; (1984) and &quot;It&#x27;s Alive III: Island of the Alive&quot; (1987). He guest starred on &quot;Finder of Lost Loves&quot;, and &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;. His last non-&quot;Days&quot; role was in &quot;A Message from Holly&quot; (1992).

Carey did the onstage introduction for the &quot;Stars of the Days Of Our Lives&quot; and musical artist/director Ricky Dee at the Greek Theatre (1992)

==Published work==
Carey wrote several books of poetry, and a 1991 autobiography, &quot;The Days of My Life&quot;. For his contribution to television, Carey has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 6536 Hollywood Boulevard.

==Personal life==
Carey was married to Elizabeth Heckscher from 1943 until their divorce in 1969. They had six children: Lynn, Lisa, Stevens, Theresa, Edward Macdonald Jr., and Paul. Later, he dated Lois Kraines. The couple remained together from 1973 until Carey&#x27;s death. His grandchildren include Ellie Diamond and Vytas and Aras Baskauskas. He has a godson, Maurice Heckscher.

<text>The Council of Philippopolis in 343, 344, or 347 was a result of Arian bishops from the Eastern Roman Empire leaving the Council of Sardica to form their own counter council. In Philippopolis, they anathemized the term &quot;homoousios&quot;, in effect excommunicating Pope Julius I as well as their rivals at the Council in Sardica, and introduced the term Anomoian and as a result, the Arian controversy was perpetuated, rather than resolved, as was the original intention of the Roman emperors Constans and Constantius.

Serdica is now called Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. Philippopolis is now called Plovdiv, Bulgaria&#x27;s second largest city.

<text>The Type 59 (; industrial designation: WZ-120) main battle tank is a Chinese-produced version of the Soviet T-54A tank, an early model of the ubiquitous T-54/55 series. The first vehicles were produced in 1958 and it was accepted into service in 1959, with serial production beginning in 1963. Over 9,500 of the tanks were produced by the time production ended in 1985 with approximately 5,500 serving with the Chinese armed forces. The tank formed the backbone of the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army armoured units until the early 2000s, with an estimated 5,000 of the later Type 59-I and Type 59-II variants in service in 2002.

The Type 59 was modified several times during its service. It was also the basis of several later Chinese tank designs including the Type 69 and Type 79 tanks.

==Description==
The Type 59 is almost identical to the early production Soviet T-54As, but there are some key differences. The Type 59 was not originally fitted with the infrared searchlight or main gun stabilization of the T-54.

The Type 59 has a conventional post-war layout with an engine compartment at the rear and a cast dome-shaped gun turret in the centre of the hull. The hull is welded steel varying in thickness between 99 mm on the front lower glacis to 20 mm on the hull floor. The turret varies in thickness from 39–100 mm.

The driver sits in the front left of the hull, and is provided with a hatch immediately above his seat, which opens to the left. The driver has two pop-up vision blocks which give coverage ahead and slightly to the right when buttoned up. The commander sits in the turret along with the gunner and loader. The commander&#x27;s hatch is on the turret left, with the gunner sitting forward and below him. The loader sits on the right of the turret and has a hatch above him. The turret has a non-rotating floor, which complicated the crew&#x27;s operations as they would not rotate with the turret.

The turret mounts a rifled 100 mm Type 59 cannon, for which 34 rounds are typically carried. A Type 59T 7.62 mm machine gun is mounted coaxially with the main gun. A Type 54 12.7 mm anti-aircraft machine gun (the Chinese copy of the Russian 12.7 mm M1938/46 DShKM heavy machine gun) is provided above the gunner&#x27;s hatch for which 200 rounds are carried. 3,500 rounds of 7.62 mm ammunition are normally carried.

The turret has a powered traverse mechanism that is probably comparable to the T-54 traverse mechanism which can rotate the turret through 360 degrees in 21 seconds. Very early models of the Type 59 gun had manual elevation gear, later replaced with a powered system which allowed the gun to be aimed at between +17 and −4 degrees (the average depression for Western tanks is -10, which allows for better usage of hull-down tactics). Later models added vertical stabilization to make firing on the move practical. An infrared searchlight-based night vision system was retrofitted to the tank with an infrared periscope for the commander gunner and driver.

The tank is powered by a Model 12150L V-12 liquid-cooled diesel engine, which develops at 2,000 rpm. The engine feeds a manual gearbox with five forward and one reverse gear. A total of 815 litres of diesel can be carried internally in the tank, with a further 400 litres carried externally giving a maximum road range of 600 kilometers, or approximately 430 km using only internal fuel. The tank has five road wheels on each side with a prominent gap between the first and second road wheel. The track is driven by a drive sprocket at the rear, with an idler at the front. It is notable that there are no return rollers. The suspension is a torsion bar system. Engine exhaust is on the left fender.

Ammunition is stored inside the turret, which increases the odds of a catastrophic secondary explosion should the tank&#x27;s interior be penetrated by enemy fire. Crew survivability is hence low.

==History==
After the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, the Soviets agreed to assist China in building a tank manufacturing facility to manufacture the T-54A MBT in 1956. Initially, the tanks were assembled with Soviet-supplied parts, which were gradually replaced by Chinese-made components. The tank was accepted into service by the PLA in 1959, and given the designation Type 59.

Over the years, the Type 59 design was enhanced with various domestically developed and western technologies; when the PLA captured a Soviet T-62 during the Sino-Soviet border conflict in 1969, improvements based on the T-62 were incorporated into the Type 59 design to become the Type 69 MBT. The Type 69 was further upgraded with Western technology and became the Type 79 MBT. The Type 59 was, therefore, the first in China&#x27;s first generation of main battle tanks, the Type 79 being the last. The Type 79 was superseded by the Type 80 second-generation MBT.

The Type 59 MBT is also known as WZ-120 by its manufacturer. Over 10,000 were produced between 1959 and the mid-1980s. The Type 59 and its successor, the Type 69, were widely exported, with thousands sold overseas. Today an estimated 5,000 Type 59 MBTs remain in PLA inventory, but it&#x27;s being supplanted by the more capable Type 96 and Type 99 MBTs.

==Combat service==
The first war involving the Type 59 was in Vietnam, where North Vietnam fielded at least several hundreds supplied directly from their Chinese ally against American tanks used by their South Vietnamese enemy, such as the M41 Walker Bulldog light tank and the M48 Patton main battle tank. Against the US tanks it faced in Vietnam, the Type 59, along with the similar T-54 tank of Soviet origin (also widely operated in the war by North Vietnam), achieved some success against enemy armour. Most of the losses of armour suffered by the US and South Vietnamese forces were to North Vietnamese infantry-based anti-tank weapons, such as the RPG-7, rather than to North Vietnam&#x27;s own tanks and other armour.

The Type 59 was also fielded during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, in the Battle of Longewala and Battle of Chamb, where Pakistani Type 59 tanks faced Indian T-54 and T-55 tanks.

Following the Vietnam War, the Sino-Vietnamese War of 1979 was the next largest use of Type 59 tanks to date in modern Chinese military history. China committed nearly 300 Type 59, Type 62, and Type 63 tanks and armoured fighting vehicles (AFVs) into the conflict against their former ally, with 48 of the total listed above lost to Vietnamese anti-tank action. The tanks of 42nd Corps, as the vanguard force responsible for cutting off the northern Vietnamese city of Cao Bằng, bore the brunt of the losses in armour and managed to advance only 30 km within 3 days. The poor performance of tanks and AFVs in this battle was attributed to the mountainous and hilly terrain in much of northern Vietnam that was inherently unsuitable for mechanized warfare, just like in Korea. The light armour on the Type 62 tank (a lighter version of the Type 59 which predominantly served as a combat-reconnaissance vehicle) also proved inadequate in protection against small and light anti-tank weapons, such as anti-tank grenades.

Iran received 300 Type 59 tanks from North Korea and China during the Iran–Iraq War. They were fielded by both the regular Artesh and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The T-72 proved highly superior to the Chinese tank. On the other hand, Iraq received 1,000 Type 59s from China. The Iraqi Type 59 tanks were later used during the 1991 Gulf War.

The Sudan also used Type 59 tanks during the Second Sudanese Civil War. Five were lost to the Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Army near Yei in March 1997.

Type 59 tanks were involved in the Chinese government&#x27;s violent crackdown on the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, a column of which were obstructed in the Tank Man incident.

The Type 59s of the Zairian Special Presidential Division saw limited action in 1998 against the rebels of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo.

== Variants ==

===Domestic models===
;Type 59: The basic variant, a T-54A clone without an IR searchlight. Entered production in 1957. This vehicle is also known as the ZTZ59.

;Type 59-I: Improved variant fitted with a Type 69-II 100 mm rifled gun, as well as a laser rangefinder, hydraulic servo-system, primitive fire-control system, automatic fire suppression system, and rubber track skirts. The Type 59-I includes several versions with different armour and fire control configurations. This vehicle is also known as the ZTZ59-I.

;Type 59A: Intermediate variant between the Type 59-I and Type 59-II lacking a two-plane stabilizer and IR searchlight. The vehicle first entered production in 1984 and was designed to fill the gap while the Type 59-II was still in development. This vehicle is also known as the ZTZ59A.

;Type 59-II: The Type 59-II (also known as WZ-120B) is an upgrade mounting a ZPL-81 105 mm rifled gun, a licence-built Royal Ordnance L7, and adding an image intensification/infrared night sight. Mass increased to 36.5 tonnes. This vehicle is also known as the ZTZ59-II.

;Type 59-IIA: Although the Type 59-II was a very successful design, the tank still relied on the West to supply parts. As a result, the Type 59-IIA was developed. By the end of 1984, the China First Tractor Factory and other production facilities began to develop a further upgrade to the Type 59-II. A prototype was completed by October 1985, featuring an improved ZPL-81A with a thermal sleeve, new domestic light spot fire control system with a 2-axis stabiliser, and composite armour. The automatic fire suppression system and automatic fire extinguishing devices were improved so that they could be used while generating smoke or firing the onboard smoke grenade launchers. This vehicle is also known as the ZTZ59-IIA.

;Type 59D1: The Type 59D1 (also known as WZ-120C) is an upgrade with explosive reactive armour, computerized stabilized fire-control system, the ZPL-83A 105 mm gun improved from the older Type 59-II, and a night vision system. This vehicle is also known as the ZTZ59D1.

;Type 59D: Type 59D (also known as WZ-120D) is an upgrade of the Type 59D1. The Type 59D has a longer 105 mm gun at 62 caliber, known as the ZPL-94 or Type 94. The gun has a range of 2000 m, and may fire ATGMs out to 5500 m. A thermal sight is also available. This vehicle is also known as the ZTZ59D.

;Type 59G: An upgrade of the Type 59, featuring a redesigned turret and armour. It uses a turret similar to that of the Type 96A, a 125 mm gun, modern fire control systems, arrow-shaped armour, spaced armour, and possibly third-generation subsystems. This vehicle is also known as the ZTZ59G.

;Jaguar: The Jaguar was a prototype vehicle based on the Type 59 chassis that was jointly developed by the United States and China during 1980s, made possible by the US-Chinese détente of the 1970s. Planned to replace China&#x27;s existing tank fleet, as well as for the export market, the tank featured improvements to the standard Type 59&#x27;s engine, armament, armour, turret, optics, electronics, fire control and suspension. Following the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, American-Chinese relations soured and the Chinese withdrew from the project. The Americans continued alone and successfully completed the design, however the end of the Cold War saw a glut in the international tank market and thus no orders were ever placed for the vehicle.

;Type 62 Light Tank:

In the late 1950s, the PLA submitted requirements for a light tank more suitable for operations in China&#x27;s southern region. Development on the new Type 62 tank began in 1958, which was a scaled-down Type 59 MBT with simplified equipment. The Type 62 light tank entered batch production in 1963, and approx. 800 were produced by 1978. The Type 62 light tank weights only 21 tons, and is equipped with a Type 62-85TC 85 mm rifled gun, and 3 machine guns. An improved Type 62-I version was produced with better FCS with laser rangefinder, and turret storage racks for added protection. Other versions based on the Type 62 include the Type 79 recovery vehicle (prototype only) and Type 82 earth-mover.

The PLA deployed the Type 62 light tank to Vietnam during the 1979 Sino-Vietnam conflict. They found that the thin armour of the Type 62 tank could be penetrated easily by hand-held anti-tank weapons, such as the 40 mm RPG. The Type 62 tank suffered severe losses during the conflict, which convinced the PLA to develop new second-generation MBTs. The Type 62 tank received a major upgrade in 2000, with new welded turret, vertically stabilised 105 mm rifled gun, fire-control system, night vision device, smoke grenade launchers, and explosive reactive armor (ERA) package. This vehicle is also known as the ZTQ62.

;Type 69 / 79:

Improved Type 59 MBT built by 617 Factory (Inner Mongolia First Machine Group Co. Ltd). Only saw limited service in the PLA, but was an export success in the 1980s with more than 2,000 sold worldwide.

;Type 73:
This armoured recovery vehicle is a Type 59 with its turret removed. The vehicle is armed with a single 12.7 mm machine gun. This armoured recovery vehicle is not believed to have a winch and is limited to towing operations.

;Type 59 Heavy Infantry Fighting Vehicle
The modernized HIFV model of Type 59 weighs around 40 tons (or around 35 tons, sources differ here) and can carry up to seven passengers. Modifications include moving the engine to the front of the vehicle chassis, increasing tank armour including explosive reactive armour on all sides, and installing a rear door for dismounting infantry. the VN11 uses a turret similar to the Type 86 turret.

;QN-506
It is a modernised variant of the Type 59 using the tank&#x27;s chassis similar to its Russian counterpart the BMPT Terminator. The vehicle was first appeared at the Zhuhai Air Show in China in November 2018, and is armed with four QN-502C anti-tank missiles, twenty QN-201 multi-purpose mini missiles, four S-570 loitering munitions, an unmanned 30 mm cannon, a 7.62 mm machine gun, six grenade launchers, and a quadcopter surveillance drone.

<text>Famous Studios (renamed Paramount Cartoon Studios in 1956) was the first animation division of the film studio Paramount Pictures from 1942 to 1967. Famous was established as a successor company to Fleischer Studios, after Paramount seized control of the aforementioned studio amid the departure of its founders, Max and Dave Fleischer, in 1942. The studio&#x27;s productions included three series started by the Fleischers—&quot;Popeye the Sailor&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot;, and &quot;Screen Songs&quot;—as well as &quot;Little Audrey&quot;, &quot;Little Lulu&quot;, &quot;Casper the Friendly Ghost&quot;, &quot;Honey Halfwitch&quot;, &quot;Herman and Katnip&quot;, &quot;Baby Huey&quot;, and the &quot;Noveltoons&quot; and &quot;Modern Madcaps&quot; series.

The &quot;Famous&quot; name was previously used by Famous Players Film Company, one of several companies which in 1912 became Famous Players–Lasky Corporation, the company which founded Paramount Pictures. Paramount&#x27;s music publishing branch, which held the rights to all of the original music in the Fleischer/Famous cartoons, was named Famous Music, and a movie theater chain in Canada owned by Paramount was called Famous Players.

The library of Famous Studios cartoons is currently divided between three separate film studios (via various subsidiaries): 
* Paramount Pictures via Melange Pictures (which owns the Pre-October 1950 cartoons by Fleischer and Famous Studios cartoons- outside of &quot;Popeye&quot; and &quot;Superman&quot;) and Paramount Animation (which owns the March 1962-December 1967 cartoons); 
* Universal Pictures via DreamWorks Animation and DreamWorks Classics (which owns the November 1950-February 1962 cartoons under Harvey Films); 
* Warner Bros. via Turner Entertainment Co. (which owns all the &quot;Popeye the Sailor&quot; cartoons, with King Features Entertainment under license for the original comics and characters); and DC Entertainment (which owns all the &quot;Superman&quot; cartoons).

=== Fleischer Studios dissolution ===

Fleischer Studios was a successful animation studio responsible for producing cartoon shorts starring characters such as Betty Boop and Popeye the Sailor. The studio moved its operations from New York City to Miami, Florida in 1938, following union problems and the start of production on its first feature film, &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1939). While &quot;Gulliver&quot; was a success, the expense of the move and increased overhead costs created financial problems for the Fleischer Studios. The studio depended upon advances and loans from its distributor, Paramount Pictures, in order to continue production on its short subjects and to begin work on a second feature, &quot;Mr. Bug Goes to Town&quot; (also known as &quot;Hoppity Goes to Town&quot;).

Compounding the problems the studio was facing was the fact that the studio&#x27;s co-founders, brothers Max Fleischer and Dave Fleischer, were becoming increasingly estranged, and by this time were no longer speaking to each other due to personal and professional disputes. On May 25, 1941, Paramount assumed full ownership of Fleischer Studios, and required the Fleischer brothers to submit signed letters of resignation, to be used at Paramount&#x27;s discretion. Following the unsuccessful release of &quot;Mr. Bug&quot; in December 1941, Max Fleischer sent Paramount a telegram expressing his inability to cooperate with Dave. Paramount responded by producing the letters of resignation, severing the Fleischer brothers from control of their studio.

Paramount renamed the studio Famous Studios. Paramount owned the company but Famous remained a separate entity. Three top Fleischer employees were promoted to run the animation studio: business manager Sam Buchwald, storyboard artist Isadore Sparber, and Max Fleischer&#x27;s son-in-law, head animator Seymour Kneitel. Buchwald assumed Max Fleischer&#x27;s place as executive producer, while Sparber and Kneitel shared Dave Fleischer&#x27;s former responsibilities as supervising producers and credited directors. A third animation director, Dan Gordon, remained only briefly before being fired shortly after the move to New York. Although the Fleischers left the studio at the end of 1941, Famous Studios was not officially incorporated until May 25, 1942, after Paramount&#x27;s contract with Fleischer Studios had formally run its course. The first Famous Studios cartoon was the Popeye short &quot;You&#x27;re a Sap, Mr. Jap&quot;, released on August 7, 1942.

=== Early years ===
Shortly after the takeover, Paramount began plans to move a significantly downsized Famous Studios back to New York, a move completed early in 1943. Virtually all of the Famous staff, including voice artist/storyman Jack Mercer, storyman Carl Meyer, voice artist Mae Questel, and animators such as Myron Waldman, David Tendlar, Thomas Johnson, Nicholas Tafuri, and Al Eugster, were holdovers from the Fleischer era. These artists remained with Famous/Paramount for much of the studio&#x27;s existence. As at Fleischer, the head animators carried out the tasks that were assigned to animation directors at other studios, while the credited directors—Kneitel, Sparber, Gordon, and Disney/Terrytoons veteran Bill Tytla—acted more as supervisors. Sammy Timberg served as musical director until he was succeeded in 1944 by Winston Sharples, who formerly worked with the Van Beuren Studios.

Continuing series from the Fleischer period included &quot;Popeye the Sailor&quot; and &quot;Superman&quot;, both licensed from popular comics characters. The expensive &quot;Superman&quot; cartoons, having lost their novelty value with exhibitors, ended production in 1943, a year after Famous&#x27; inception. They were replaced by a series starring the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; comic-strip character &quot;Little Lulu&quot;. Also in 1943, Famous began producing the formerly black-and-white &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoons in Technicolor, and began a new series of one-shot cartoons under the umbrella title &quot;Noveltoons&quot; (similar in respects to the &quot;Color Classics&quot; series from Fleischer Studios, and also the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series from Warner Bros.).

The &quot;Noveltoons&quot; series introduced several popular characters such as &quot;Herman and Katnip&quot;, &quot;Baby Huey&quot;, and &quot;Casper the Friendly Ghost&quot;. &quot;Casper&quot; was created by writer Seymour Reit and Famous animator Joe Oriolo in the late 1930s as a children&#x27;s-book manuscript, and was sold to Famous during World War II. It became the studio&#x27;s most successful wholly owned property.

In 1947, Paramount decided to stop paying &quot;Little Lulu&quot; creator Marge Buell licensing royalties, and created another &quot;mischievous girl&quot; character, &quot;Little Audrey&quot;, as a replacement. That same year Famous resurrected an old Fleischer series, &quot;Screen Songs&quot;, introducing a new series of musical cartoons featuring a &quot;bouncing ball&quot; sing-along. In 1951, the Screen Songs became &quot;Kartune Musical Shorts,&quot; which ended in 1953 after Max Fleischer claimed ownership of the &quot;bouncing ball&quot; trademark. Only two more musical cartoons were released (as one-shot Noveltoons): 1954&#x27;s &quot;Candy Cabaret&quot; and 1963&#x27;s &quot;Hobo&#x27;s Holiday&quot;.

Although the studio still carried much of the staff from the Fleischer regime, animation fans and historians note that its films soon diverged from the Fleischer style. Many historians, including Leonard Maltin, derided the company style for being highly formulaic and largely oriented toward a children&#x27;s audience, with none of the artistic ambition or sophistication that the management under the Fleischer brothers strove for.

=== Later period and sales of cartoon libraries ===
Sam Buchwald died of a heart attack in 1951. Seymour Kneitel and Isadore Sparber became the production heads of the studio shortly afterward, and Dave Tendlar was promoted to director in 1953.

The mid- and late-1950s brought a number of significant changes for Famous Studios. In 1955, Paramount sold most of its 1942–1950 shorts and cartoons (except for the &quot;Popeye&quot; and &quot;Superman&quot; shorts) to U.M. &amp; M. TV Corporation for television distribution. The &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoons were acquired by Associated Artists Productions, and the &quot;Superman&quot; cartoons had already reverted to Superman&#x27;s owners National Comics after the studio&#x27;s film rights to the character had expired. On October 1, 1956, Famous Studios was downsized and reorganized. Paramount assumed full control of the studio, integrating it as a division named Paramount Cartoon Studios. Around the same time, Isadore Sparber was fired, leaving Seymour Kneitel in sole charge of the studio. In addition, because of studio budget cuts, the animation quality of the shorts began to drop sharply; by 1959 everything that the studio was turning out began to look noticeably cheap, with limited animation. Paramount also ceased using Technicolor by this time in favor of less expensive color processes. The last Famous Studios short to use Technicolor was &quot;Katnip&#x27;s Big Day&quot;, the finale of the &quot;Herman and Katnip&quot; cartoon series. Despite the studio submitting some of their shorts for Academy Award consideration, none received a nomination.

Paramount sold its 1950–59 cartoon film library and the rights to its established characters to Harvey Comics in 1959; however, the final theatrical cartoon to have any of their established characters already acquired by Harvey Comics since was &quot;Turtle Scoop&quot; featuring Tommy Tortoise and Moe Hare (both uncredited and redrawn) in 1961. Paramount&#x27;s attempts at creating replacement characters, among them &quot;Jeepers and Creepers&quot; and &quot;The Cat&quot;, proved unsuccessful. Nonetheless, television animation production outsourced from King Features and Harvey Films brought the company additional income. Ironically, these arrangements had Paramount working on new television cartoons starring Casper, whom they had originally created, and Popeye and Little Lulu, characters they had previously licensed for theatrical cartoons. In the case of King Features&#x27; &quot;Popeye&quot; and &quot;King Features Trilogy&quot; TV cartoons, Paramount was one of several animation studios, among them Jack Kinney Productions and Rembrandt Films, to which King Features subcontracted production. The first of only two all-new &quot;Little Lulu&quot; cartoons after the character&#x27;s 13-year hiatus off-screen, &quot;Alvin&#x27;s Solo Flight&quot;, was released as part of the &quot;Noveltoons&quot; series in 1961, while twelve of the &quot;King Features Trilogy&quot; cartoons, starring characters such as Krazy Kat, Little Lulu, Beetle Bailey, and Snuffy Smith, were released theatrically by Paramount in 1962 under the title &quot;Comic Kings&quot;. In 1963, Paramount sold its pre-March 1962 cartoons to Harvey for one U.S. dollar, as part of a larger agreement to produce 26 new Casper cartoons for Harvey&#x27;s &quot;The New Casper Cartoon Show&quot; for 78,000 dollars.

Seymour Kneitel died of a heart attack in 1964, and Paramount brought in comic-book veteran Howard Post to run the cartoon studio. Under Post&#x27;s supervision, Paramount began new cartoon series and characters such as &quot;Swifty and Shorty&quot; and &quot;Honey Halfwitch&quot; (the latter having originated from the &quot;Modern Madcaps&quot; series in the 1965 short &quot;Poor Little Witch Girl&quot;), and allowed comic strip artist Jack Mendelsohn to direct two well-received cartoons based upon children&#x27;s imaginations and drawing styles: &quot;The Story of George Washington&quot; and &quot;A Leak in the Dike&quot; (both 1965).

However, Post left the studio due to internal conflicts with the Paramount staff. His replacement was Shamus Culhane, a veteran of the Fleischer Studios. Culhane completed a few films that Post started and then ignored the rule book and made films that were very different from the previous regime. In 1966, the studio subcontracted &quot;The Mighty Thor&quot; cartoons from Grantray-Lawrence Animation, producers of the animated television series &quot;The Marvel Super Heroes&quot;. In 1967, Culhane directed another short based on children&#x27;s art, &quot;My Daddy, the Astronaut&quot;, which became Paramount&#x27;s first film to be shown at an animation festival. However, when Paramount&#x27;s board of directors rejected a proposal to produce episodes for a second Grantray-Lawrence series, &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, Culhane quit the studio, and was succeeded by former Terrytoons animator Ralph Bakshi in mid-1967. 

In 1967 Paramount radically revamped its short-subject release schedule to reflect all-new attractions. Black-and-white subjects were discontinued, as were all cartoon reissues (such as the &quot;Popeye Champions&quot;). The studio retired the &quot;Noveltoons&quot; and &quot;Modern Madcaps&quot; series, replacing them with &quot;Go Go Toons&quot;, &quot;Merry Makers&quot;, and &quot;Fractured Fables&quot;. Ralph Bakshi quickly put several shorts into production, experimenting with new characters and ideas, but by late 1968 Paramount&#x27;s new owners, Gulf+Western, had decided to shut down the animation studio, a task completed in December. The last cartoon from Paramount Cartoon Studios, &quot;Mouse Trek&quot;, the finale of the &quot;Fractured Fables&quot; series, premiered on December 31, 1967.

== Legacy ==
Despite the reputation of the studio in recent years, the Famous shorts have since gained a cult following on both public-domain home media and in animation circles.

The 1961 short &quot;Abner the Baseball&quot; is displayed at the Baseball Hall of Fame.

== Ownership and licensing ==
Throughout the 1950s, most of the major Hollywood studios sold off their film libraries to various television companies. In the case of Paramount, throughout the decade, they sold off the Famous Studios library to various different TV syndication companies resulting in multiple studios owning different cartoons.

=== U.M. &amp; M. TV Corporation ===
In January 1956, Paramount sold the Pre-October 1950 Fleischer and Famous Studios cartoons (excluding &quot;Popeye&quot; and &quot;Superman&quot;) to U.M. &amp; M. TV Corporation for $3 million. In 1957, U.M &amp; M was bought out by National Telefilm Associates (NTA). In the 1980s, NTA changed its name to Republic Pictures after the original studio of that name, whose library NTA had also acquired. After a brief period of ownership by Spelling Entertainment in 1994, Republic Pictures was purchased by Paramount&#x27;s parent company Viacom in 1996, placing the shorts back in Paramount&#x27;s control (Republic Pictures was renamed Melange Pictures LLC. in 2006). 

Due to poor attention to then-required copyright renewals over the decades, many of these cartoons are now in the public domain.

=== &quot;Popeye&quot; and &quot;Superman&quot; ===
In June 1956, Paramount sold the entirety of the Fleischer/Famous Studios &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoons from 1933 to 1957 to Associated Artists Productions (which had also recently purchased much of the Warner Bros. back catalog) for $1.25 million. The assets of A.A.P. were in turn purchased by United Artists in 1958. In 1981, United Artists merged with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to form MGM/UA. In 1986, Ted Turner&#x27;s Turner Broadcasting System attempted to acquire MGM/UA, but due to debt concerns, Turner was forced to sell the company back to its previous owner Kirk Kerkorian. However, Turner kept most of the pre-May 1986 MGM library as well as a few portions of the United Artists library, including the former A.A.P. library, and formed his own holding company Turner Entertainment Co. to manage the rights. In 1996, Turner Broadcasting merged with Time Warner (now Warner Bros. Discovery). Since then, Warner Bros. controls the rights to the theatrical &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoons via Turner Entertainment Co. 

As per their original contract, the rights to the &quot;Superman&quot; cartoons reverted to National Comics after Paramount&#x27;s deal expired in 1947. While the cartoons themselves are now in the public domain after their original copyrights were not renewed, the ancillary rights are still owned by DC Comics, and the cartoons (in authorized editions from the original negatives) are distributed by Warner Bros., which has owned DC since 1969.

=== Harvey Comics and Harvey Films ===
In July 1958, Paramount sold off the Famous Studios cartoons made between November 1950 and December 1959, as well as the rights to all original characters created by Famous Studios (Casper, Baby Huey, Herman and Katnip, Little Audrey, etc.) to Harvey Comics for $1.7 million, who in turn created Harvey Films to handle the rights and rebranded the cartoons as &quot;Harveytoons&quot;. The deal also gave ABC television distribution rights to the cartoons for the next 30 years (the rights reverted back to Harvey in 1989) while Paramount retained theatrical rights. In 1963, Paramount sold its cartoons made between January 1960 and February 1962, again to Harvey Comics, for $1.

In 2001, Harvey Comics was purchased by the holding company Classic Media. In 2012, Classic Media was purchased by DreamWorks Animation, which retains ownership of the cartoons. In 2016, DreamWorks Animation was purchased by Comcast&#x27;s NBCUniversal, with Universal Pictures assuming the distribution of the cartoons on behalf of DreamWorks.

However, while NBCUniversal and DreamWorks Animation own the bulk of the rights to the &quot;Harveytoons&quot; catalog, as per their original 1958 contract, Paramount still retains theatrical rights to the cartoons and thus also controls the original camera negatives. However, the contract also stipulates that Harvey (and by extension, DreamWorks and NBCUniversal) are allowed to access the original film elements from Paramount whenever they feel the need to update their prints.

=== The later cartoons ===
Paramount continues to own the rights to the cartoons made from March 1962 to December 1967.

=== Home media ===
As of 2021, there has been no official release of the Paramount-owned Famous Studios library. Many of the cartoons are in the public domain and widely available (albeit usually in poor quality) in several low-budget DVDs and Blu-Rays sold in supermarkets and department stores. In 2012, Thunderbean Animation restored and released a collection of public-domain &quot;Noveltoons&quot; on DVD entitled &quot;Noveltoons Original Classics&quot;.

In 2008, Warner Home Video released &quot;Popeye the Sailor: 1941–1943, Volume 3&quot;, the third volume of a series of &quot;Popeye&quot; DVDs. It contained all the black &amp; white Famous Studios &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoons alongside the last of the Fleischer shorts. In 2018, Warner Archive released &quot;Popeye the Sailor: The 1940s, Volume 1&quot; which continued where the previous set left off and contained the first 14 Technicolor Famous Studio cartoons from 1943 to 1945. Warner Archive continued the collection with &quot;Popeye the Sailor: The 1940s, Volume 2&quot; and &quot;Popeye the Sailor: The 1940s, Volume 3&quot; officially collecting all the Popeye cartoons from the 1940s. The remaining Famous Studios &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoons from the 1950s have yet to be released.

Additionally, in 2006 to coincide with the release of &quot;Superman Returns&quot;, Warner Home Video restored and released all the Fleischer and Famous Studios &quot;Superman&quot; shorts as bonus material on the &quot;The Christopher Reeve Superman Collection&quot; and &quot;Superman Ultimate Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; box-sets. Later in 2009, Warner Home Video released a standalone DVD set entitled &quot;Max Fleischer&#x27;s Superman: 1941–1942&quot; which contained all the Fleischer and Famous Studios &quot;Superman&quot; shorts. In 2023, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment released a Blu-Ray version entitled &quot;Max Fleischer&#x27;s Superman: 1941–1943&quot;.

During the 1990s, Harvey Entertainment produced &quot;The Harveytoons Show&quot;, which collected most of the Harvey-owned Famous cartoons, first aired in syndication with the series being consulted by animation historian Jerry Beck. In 2006, Classic Media released 52 of the show&#x27;s 78 episodes on a four-disc DVD set titled &quot;Harvey Toons – The Complete Collection&quot;. In 2011, Vivendi Entertainment and Classic Media released all Herman and Katnip cartoons on a single-disc DVD set titled &quot;Herman and Katnip: The Complete Collection&quot;. Also in 2011, Shout! Factory under license from Classic Media released 61 of 78 Casper cartoons from &quot;The Harveytoons Show&quot;, on a three-disc DVD set titled &quot;Casper the Friendly Ghost: The Complete Collection&quot;. On November 2, 2021, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment (through Studio Distribution Services joint venture label) released a three-disc DVD boxset titled &quot;The Best of the Harveytoons Show&quot;.

<text>The Type 69 () and Type 79 () are Chinese first generation main battle tanks. Both were developments of the Type 59 medium tank (a locally produced Soviet T-54A) with technologies derived from the T-62. They were the first indigenously developed main battle tanks by China, although also classified as medium tanks while in development and service. Their lineage from the T-54A can be seen through the distinct gap between the first and second road wheels. Other improvements included a new engine, ballistic computers, and laser rangefinders. The more advanced Type 79 variant was equipped with a 105 mm rifled gun which was also found on the Type 80 tank.

==History==
=== Development of the Type 69 ===
After the Sino-Soviet split, the Soviet Union withdrew its technical staff and support to China&#x27;s arms industry. This caused China&#x27;s domestic tank development to stagnate significantly. Sometime after 1960, the PLA tank corps and Fifth Ministry of Machine Building embarked on the development of China&#x27;s first domestically developed tank. In 1965, development objectives were finalized and the product was named &quot;WZ121&quot; internally. In 1966, the first prototype rolled off the factory. However, the Cultural Revolution and its resulting chaos further impeded tank development.

During the 1969 Sino-Soviet border conflict, the PLA was able to capture a Soviet T-62 MBT. The captured tank was examined and some of its components such as the Soviet Luna IR (infrared) searchlight system, were copied and integrated into the Type 69 prototype. After around a decade of development, the first domestically developed and produced Chinese tank was inducted into the PLA ground forces as the Type 1969 Medium Tank or Type 69 Tank for short.

The Type 69&#x27;s appearance did not differ much from that of the Type 59. The fume extractor on the 100mm gun was moved back slightly and there was a large IR light attached to the turret. There was a laser rangefinder on the gun mantlet and a smaller IR light on the commander&#x27;s hatch, making it the first Chinese tank capable of fighting in the dark. The main upgrade in the Type 69 was in its firepower. The Type 69 was the first Chinese tank to be outfitted with a 100mm smoothbore gun capable of firing APFSDS rounds. It also had two-plane gun stabilization. With these upgrades the Type 69 was a much more battle-capable MBT than the Type 59, especially at night. It was also faster thanks to an upgraded engine. The Type 69&#x27;s protection, however, was essentially the same as the Type 59. Like the Type 59, it also did not have any NBC protection.

The Type 69 was incorporated into service in 1974. As it was fundamentally an improved variant of the Type 59, however, the Chinese military decided to develop another second-generation main battle tank based on new technologies. The new tank program, also known as the Type 80, began development in 1978, built upon the foundation that was laid during the development of the Type 69 tank.

==== Deployment and teething problems ====
Despite these improvements, due to the large number of technical problems when operating the tanks, the initial batch of Type 69 tanks were returned to the factory. By March 1974, only 100 Type 69 tanks had been produced. The relevant departments in tank development did not have sufficient experience or knowledge, and the overly ambitious design requirements meant that a large amount of time was wasted. Compounding to this immaturity in the tank manufacturing industry was the on-going Cultural Revolution. The Type 69 took almost a decade of development but resulted in a tank that looked only marginally different from the original Type 59 and was only significantly different in its firepower. By the time the Type 69 went into production, other countries had already developed much more advanced tanks such as the American M60 MBTs or what would eventually become the Russian T-72.

==== Development of the Type 79 ====
Relations between China and the West warmed in the 1980s, and China was able to import some Western technologies to improve its weapon systems. The Type 69 was upgraded with Western systems such as the British Marconi FCS, and the L7 105 mm gun. The new version received the designation Type 79, which represented the conclusion of China&#x27;s first-generation tank development.

Both the Type 69 and Type 79 tanks share almost identical hulls and turrets with the older Type 59. The only difference is that the two more recent tank models have been upgraded with better technologies that were either captured or bought from more advanced countries. (Gelbart 1996:17-19) The Chinese Type 59, 69 and 79 tanks can therefore be viewed as part of the same, evolutionary tank family in the same way that the Soviet T-54, T-55 and T-62 tanks share a common lineage.

Today only a couple of hundred Type 69/Type 79s remain in PLA inventory, mostly deployed with training or reserve units. The Type 69/Type 79 are being replaced by the newer Type 96 and Type 99 MBTs.

===Foreign service===
The PLA was dissatisfied with the Type 69&#x27;s performance, but it still became one of China&#x27;s most successful armored vehicle exports. These export versions were called Type 69-II (in contrast to the domestic Type 69-I) and had incorporated improvements which were not found in the original Type 69-I. Over 2,000 were sold worldwide in the 1980s. The simplicity, robustness and low cost of the tanks made them attractive on the export market, and China sold hundreds to both sides during the Iran–Iraq War. (Gelbart 1996:18) Many of the vehicles were later used by Saddam Hussein during the Gulf War and the 2003 Iraq War.

During the 1980s, China sold hundreds of Type 69 MBTs to Iraq. By the Persian Gulf War of 1990 and 1991, western analysts claim that Iraq had upgraded some Type 69s with a 105 mm gun, a 60 mm mortar, and a 125 mm gun with an auto-loader. All of them were reinforced with frontal layer armor welded on the glacis plate. All these versions were known as Type 69-QMs. It was reported during the 1991 Gulf War that the Iraqi Type 69 units fought harder than the elite Republican Guard units, equipped with T-72 MBTs. One possible explanation is that Saddam ordered his Republican Guard units to preserve their strength, while sending the rest of the army, equipped with inferior Type 69 tanks, to the frontline.

According to battle reports from the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Type 69-QMs were used by the Iraqi Army units defending Nasiriyah in March 2003, most of them being employed as artillery pillboxes. They played an important role in the ambushes mounted against the US Army 507th Maintenance Company and Charlie Company of the 1st Battalion, 2nd Marines, before AH-1 Cobra helicopters wiped out the Iraqi tanks. Two Type 69s destroyed at least four vehicles of the 507th, among them a heavy truck rammed by one of the tanks. There is also a first hand account of about four Type 69s hidden behind some buildings pounding the Marines&#x27; Charlie Company with indirect fire and likely disabling several AAVs. Some combat useless Type 59/69s were emplaced as decoys or mere obstacles.

Myanmar Army Type 69 tanks also reportedly engaged Royal Thai Army M60A3 tanks in 2001 during the battle for Border Post 9631, although it is unclear if either side lost any vehicles.

==Variants==
===Prototypes===
* Type 69 – Prototype based on the Type 59 hull, fitted with a new 580 hp diesel engine, Type 69 100 mm smoothbore gun, IR searchlight, and laser rangefinder.

<doc id="676082" wikidata="Q163249" url="?curid=676082" title="Jessica Biel">
<text>Jessica Claire Timberlake (née Biel ; born March 3, 1982) is an American actress. Biel began her career as a vocalist appearing in musical productions until she was cast as Mary Camden in the family drama series &quot;7th Heaven&quot; (1996–2006), in which she achieved recognition.

In 1997, Biel won the Young Artist Award for her role in the drama film &quot;Ulee&#x27;s Gold&quot;. She received further recognition for her lead role as Erin Hardesty in the horror film remake &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; (2003). Biel has since starred in such films as &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot; (2002), &quot;&quot; (2004), &quot;Stealth&quot; (2005), &quot;The Illusionist&quot; (2006), &quot;I Now Pronounce You Chuck &amp; Larry&quot; (2007), &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot; (2010), &quot;The A-Team&quot; (2010), &quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve&quot; (2011), &quot;Total Recall&quot; (2012), and &quot;Hitchcock&quot; (2012).

In 2017, Biel was the executive producer and star of the USA Network limited drama series &quot;The Sinner&quot;, for which she received nominations for a Golden Globe Award and a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie.

== Early life and education ==
Jessica Claire Biel was born on March 3, 1982 in Ely, Minnesota, to Kimberly (née Conroe), a homemaker and spiritual healer, and Jonathan Biel, a business consultant and General Electric worker. Her paternal great-grandfather was the son of Hungarian-Jewish immigrants, which she discovered on the show &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;; she also has German, French, English, and Scandinavian ancestry. 

Biel&#x27;s family moved frequently during her childhood, living in Texas, Connecticut, and Woodstock, Illinois, before finally settling in Boulder, Colorado. While growing up, Biel played soccer and trained as a level six gymnast. 

From 2000 to 2002, she attended Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts.

== Career ==

=== Beginnings (1991–2002) ===
Biel initially trained to be a vocalist. At age nine, she appeared in several musical productions in her hometown, playing lead roles in productions such as &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. At 11 she participated in a competition sponsored by the International Modeling and Talent Association in Los Angeles where she acquired an agent and professional talent manager. She began modeling for print advertisements and appeared in commercials for products such as Dulux Paint and Pringles. In her film debut, Biel played the character Regrettal, a lead role in the ambitious musical film &quot;It&#x27;s a Digital World&quot;, produced and directed by Paul Greenberg. At age 14, after auditioning for several television pilots, Biel was cast as Mary Camden, the oldest daughter and second-oldest child in the family drama &quot;7th Heaven&quot;.

Biel landed her first feature film role as Peter Fonda&#x27;s granddaughter in the critically acclaimed drama &quot;Ulee&#x27;s Gold&quot;, released in 1997. Her performance earned her a Young Artist Award. In spring 1998, during a break from filming &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, she co-starred in &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Home for Christmas&quot; with Jonathan Taylor Thomas as his character&#x27;s love interest. When she was 17, she posed for a risque photo shoot that appeared in the March 2000 issue of &quot;Gear&quot;. Producers of &quot;7th Heaven&quot; were outraged and brought legal action against &quot;Gear&quot;. She later expressed regret for doing it, claiming she had been used and that she had been shown different pictures from those published. In 2001, Biel played the love interest of Freddie Prinze, Jr. in the baseball-themed film &quot;Summer Catch&quot;. In 2002, she starred as promiscuous college student Lara in the ensemble film &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot;, an adaptation of the Bret Easton Ellis novel. The movie received mixed reviews, became a box-office hit, and has since gained a cult following.

=== Rise to prominence (2003–2012)===
Biel was cast in her first top-billing role in &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;. Although the film met with negative reviews, it was a commercial success, scoring the number-one spot in its opening week and going on to earn more than $80 million in the U.S. In 2003, Biel began work on the third installment of the &quot;Blade&quot; film series, &quot;&quot;. Despite negative reviews, &quot;Trinity&quot; was a box office hit, grossing $150 million worldwide. After finishing it in 2004, she headed to Australia to shoot the action-thriller &quot;Stealth&quot;. Biel also appeared in the 2004 film &quot;Cellular&quot;; played a supporting role, Ellen, in the romantic comedy &quot;Elizabethtown&quot; (2005); and starred in the indie film &quot;London&quot;. In 2005, &quot;Esquire&quot; named her the &quot;Sexiest Woman Alive&quot; in a six-part series with each month revealing a different body part and clue to the woman&#x27;s identity.

In 2006, Biel played a turn-of-the-century duchess in the period piece &quot;The Illusionist&quot;, co-starring Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti. While her casting was met with a mixed response, her performance was ultimately praised. James Berardinelli of &quot;Reelviews&quot; called her the &quot;film&#x27;s real acting revelation&quot;, while Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;Handily employing a refined English accent where the others lay on a light Austrian veneer, Biel is entirely stunning enough to fight to the death over.&quot; Biel played an Iraq War veteran in the 2006 film &quot;Home of the Brave&quot;, a drama about soldiers struggling to readjust to society after facing the hardships of war. In &quot;Next&quot; Biel starred alongside Nicolas Cage and Julianne Moore. She appeared in the summer comedy &quot;I Now Pronounce You Chuck &amp; Larry&quot;, co-starring Adam Sandler and Kevin James. In late 2007, Biel signed on to play a stripper in &quot;Powder Blue&quot;, alongside Forest Whitaker (who also produced the film), Ray Liotta and Patrick Swayze. In 2007, &quot;Stuff&quot; magazine&#x27;s named her No. 1 on their &quot;100 Sexiest Women&quot;.

At the start of 2008, Biel shot &quot;Easy Virtue&quot;, an adaptation of the play by Noël Coward. Like the play, the film is set in the 1920s and Biel plays young widow Larita, who impulsively marries John Whittaker in France and must face her disapproving in-laws on returning to England. The film premiered in September 2008 at the Toronto International Film Festival. Critics praised Biel for her performance, with Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; saying Biel &quot;more than kept up&quot; with veterans Kristin Scott Thomas and Colin Firth and praising her &quot;sparkling&quot; performance. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; described her performance as &quot;an irresistible force of nature — a kind, witty, supremely intelligent and beautiful woman who ... is capable of rejoinders that thoroughly undercut her opponent&#x27;s withering criticism.&quot; Biel also performed two songs on the film&#x27;s soundtrack, &quot;Mad About the Boy&quot; and &quot;When the Going Gets Tough&quot;.

In 2009, Biel lent her voice to the animated science fiction film &quot;Planet 51&quot;. Biel performed the role of Sarah Brown with the Los Angeles Philharmonic in a fully staged concert production of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; during the 2009 season at the Hollywood Bowl. On the last night, she received a rousing standing ovation from 17,000 people. She subsequently landed a part in Lincoln Center Theater&#x27;s two-week-long workshop of the musical version of the Pedro Almodóvar film &quot;Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown&quot;, along with Salma Hayek.

In 2010, Biel starred in the large ensemble cast film &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot; and in the &quot;A-Team&quot;, based on the television series as Capt. Charissa Sosa. In 2011, she appeared in &quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve&quot;, directed by &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot;″s Garry Marshall. In 2012, Biel starred in the remake of the 1990 science fiction movie &quot;Total Recall&quot; alongside Colin Farrell and Kate Beckinsale. She portrayed actress Vera Miles in the biographical film &quot;Hitchcock&quot;, based on Stephen Rebello&#x27;s book &quot;Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho&quot;. She also appeared in &quot;Playing for Keeps&quot; with Gerard Butler.

=== Independent film route and move into producing (2013–present)===

Biel starred in the thriller film &quot;Emanuel and the Truth About Fishes&quot;, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 18, 2013. In April 2008, Biel began working on the political satire &quot;Accidental Love&quot;, with Jake Gyllenhaal. The film centers around a woman who accidentally gets a nail lodged in her head and travels to Washington, D.C. to fight for better health care. In May 2009, Biel spoke about the film&#x27;s production turmoil, saying: &quot;That was definitely an experience, something I could not say no to. I am a huge David O. Russell fan. It&#x27;s just heartbreaking that so many people put so much work into this particular project only to have it sit there, unfinished.&quot; The film was released on video on demand on February 10, 2015, and received largely negative reviews from critics.

In 2015, Biel starred in the independent drama &quot;Bleeding Heart&quot;, in which she plays a yoga instructor named May who meets her biological sister Shiva (Zosia Mamet), a sex worker, for the first time. The film premiered on April 17, 2015, at the Tribeca Film Festival, receiving mixed reviews, though Biel earned praise for her performance. Richard Lawson of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; commented: &quot;Though she&#x27;s not given too much to work with in terms of character, Biel plays May with appealing nuance, creating a low-key, bliss-based Angeleno, all light and airy and gentle and poised, who discovers within herself an untapped hardness and anger and strength... when Biel has to conjure up more profound emotions, she proves adept, and surprisingly subtle.&quot; Clayton Davis of &quot;AwardsCircuit.com&quot; also praised her performance, writing, &quot;With an internalized and very subtle performance, Biel excels in her ability to find the very motivation of May.&quot;

In 2016, Biel co-starred with Patrick Wilson (with whom she had worked on &quot;The A-Team&quot;) in the thriller &quot;A Kind of Murder&quot;, based on the novel &quot;The Blunderer&quot; by Patricia Highsmith. She voiced the character Vix in the animated film &quot;Spark&quot;, with Susan Sarandon and Hilary Swank, which was released in 2016. Biel also appeared in the drama &quot;The Book of Love&quot;, based on the book &quot;The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea&quot;, about an introverted architect (Jason Sudeikis) who loses his wife (Biel) and sets out to help a teenager named Millie (Maisie Williams). Biel also produced the project from its conception some years prior, and was directed by Bill Purple, who directed her in the short film &quot;Hole in the Paper Sky&quot;. The film was released in January 2017.

On August 2, 2017, Biel&#x27;s eight-episode limited series murder mystery, &quot;The Sinner&quot;, debuted on USA Network. Biel is both executive producer and played the series&#x27; lead character Cora Tannetti. She stated that she moved into production so that she could develop projects with challenging and interesting roles rather than waiting for them to happen.

In October 2021, it was announced Biel would star and executive produce the true-crime drama miniseries &quot;Candy&quot; for Hulu.

Biel is set to lead the upcoming sci-fi thriller &quot;Ursa Major&quot; directed by brothers Jonathan and Josh Baker.

== Personal life ==
In January 2007, Biel began dating singer-songwriter Justin Timberlake. They became engaged in December 2011 and married on October 19, 2012, at the Borgo Egnazia resort in Fasano, Italy. The couple have two sons.

Alongside Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Biel publicly lobbied in June 2019 against California&#x27;s vaccination bill that would limit medical exemptions from vaccinations without approval from a state public health officer.

=== Charitable causes and commercial enterprises===
On July 18, 2006, Biel participated in a charity auction to raise medical funds for teen Molly Bloom, who was injured in a limousine accident. &quot;I promise I&#x27;m a cheap date&quot;, Biel quipped in a pre-recorded video. John Schiffner of Fergus Falls, Minnesota, successfully bid $30,000 to have lunch with Biel. Biel and Schiffner lunched at The Palm restaurant in Denver, Colorado, on August 18, 2006.

<doc id="676090" wikidata="Q614530" url="?curid=676090" title="Type 90 tank">
<text>The is a main battle tank (MBT) of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF). It was designed and built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries as a replacement for the Type 61 and to supplement the then current fleet of Type 74 tanks, and entered service in 1990.

==History==

After the adoption of the Type 74, the Japanese High Command was already looking for a superior, completely indigenous tank design to defeat the Soviet T-72. As a result, development of a prototype, the TK-X MBT began between 1976 and 1977. Joint development was performed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and TRDI (Japan Defense Agency&#x27;s Technology Research and Development Institute). Major subcontractors included Japan Steel Works, Daikin Industries, Mitsubishi Electric, Fujitsu and NEC.

A first series of two prototypes of the Type 90 were developed, both armed with a Japanese 120 mm smoothbore gun (produced by Japan Steel Works Limited) firing Japanese ammunition (produced by Daikin Industries Limited). The first prototype (TK-X-0001) was completed by 1982, and underwent testing shortly after. Following the first tank&#x27;s completion, development began on the second prototype (TK-X-0002), until it was completed by June 1985, after experiencing delays. Testing and design modifications such as improvements to the turret and half modular type ceramic composite armour were conducted starting in October 1983, and continued until October 1986.

A second series of four prototypes was built between 1986 and 1988, incorporating changes resulting from trials with the first two prototypes. These were armed with the Rheinmetall 120 mm smoothbore gun also fitted to the German Leopard 2 and, in a modified version, the US M1A1/M1A2 Abrams main battle tanks. These second prototypes were used for development and then user trials, all of which were completed by December 1989, before Japan formally introduced the Type 90 in August 1990. Mass production began in 1990, and 30 vehicles were produced by the end of the year.

With the exception of the 120 mm smoothbore gun, which is made under license from Rheinmetall of Germany, the Type 90 and its subsystems are all designed and built in Japan, leading to higher per unit costs than comparable models from NATO countries such as the M1 Abrams and the Challenger 2. Development of upgrades to the Type 90 suffered both as a result of limited budget, which caused procurement delays, and funding prioritization in favor of the Type 10 main battle tank. Due to a perception that Type 90s are unsuited to operations in the tight confines of Japan&#x27;s urban areas, they are preferentially assigned to the JGSDF Fuji School Brigade and the 7th Armored Division based in Hokkaido, where there is sufficient room for maneuver.

With the exception of training exercises such as the annual Combined Live Fire Exercise hosted by the United States Army at Yakima Training Center in Washington state, the Type 90 has never been deployed overseas, and has never been tested in combat.

==Design==
===Armament===
The Type 90 mounts a Rheinmetall L44 120 mm smoothbore cannon licensed produced by Japan Steel Works Limited. This is the same gun that is mounted on the German Leopard 2, the American Abrams, and the South Korean K1A1 tank. Before Rheinmetall&#x27;s gun was selected, Japan had successfully produced a domestic version of the 120 mm smoothbore for testing, but the lower cost of the Rheinmetall gave it an advantage over the domestic version..

Since its introduction there have been several upgrades to the fire-control system, including the addition of a Yttrium-Aluminium-Garnet laser rangefinder with a range of 300 to 5,000 meters, a 32-bit ballistics analysis computer, improved thermal imaging and Automated-tracking systems, and improved gun stabilization. The FCS also has an automated tracking system, and is capable of engaging moving or stationary targets while moving in day or night. The automatic target tracking system uses a thermal image display which can be controlled by either the tank gunner or commander. It is capable of tracking soldiers, vehicles and helicopters. The targeting computer can also calculate lead on moving targets.

The commander&#x27;s sight consists of a 3× / 10× (day-only sight). The sight can track vertically from −29 to +29 degrees, as well as track horizontally through 180 degrees. The gunners sight has a 10 x magnification.

The gun is armed and loaded by a mechanical bustle autoloader (conveyor-belt type) developed by Mitsubishi of Japan. As with autoloader-equipped Russian main battle tanks, the French Leclerc, and the Swedish Strv 103, the Type 90 achieves manpower savings by reducing the crew to three. Its ability to operate without a loader also allows the use of a smaller turret. The practical auto-loading and firing cycle for one target is around 4–6 seconds.

Mounted in front of the gunner&#x27;s hatch on the turret is the ubiquitous Browning M2 machine gun, manufactured under license by Sumitomo Heavy Industries, part of the Sumitomo Group. In addition to the .50-caliber machine gun, a Japanese-built 7.62 mm machine gun is mounted coaxially to the left of the main gun.

===Armor===

The profile of the Type 90 is similar to the German Leopard 2A4 and it uses modular ceramic and steel composite armor, common in contemporary tank designs. The adoption of modular composite armor design facilitates the upgrading and exchange of the armor.

The Type 90 is smaller than most main battle tanks with a height of , a width of , and a weight of . It was designed with a distinctive low-slung turret with boxy, vertical sides and a long overhanging bustle. In comparison, the Leopard 2A4&#x27;s dimensions are high and wide with a weight of .

===Mobility===
The powerpack of the Type 90 tank has the Mitsubishi 10ZG32WT 10-cylinder two-stroke cycle diesel engine providing 1500 hp, coupled with Mitsubishi MT1500 automatic transmission with four forward and two reverse gears, manufactured by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (designated 10ZG32WT, MT1500). The development of the 10ZG32WT prototype was started in 1972 and was finished in 1982. It can attain a top output of 1,120 kW (1,500 horsepower @15min).

The hydropneumatic suspension units are mounted on the front and rear pair of road wheels, which can be adjusted on-the-fly to deal with uneven terrain, a requirement on Japan&#x27;s rough, mountainous terrain.

According to the Japanese Ministry of Defense official data report, the acceleration of the type is 0–200 m in 20 seconds.

===Manufacture===
The Type 90 has an approximate unit cost of 790 million Japanese yen or approximately 7.4 million US dollars at 2007 exchange rates.

341 Type 90 tanks were produced between 1990 and 2009 with an average annual production number of 19 vehicles. The original procurement plan was established in the 1980s while Japan was experiencing asset price bubble. After the asset price bubble burst in 1991 and the collapse of Soviet Union in 1992, Japan started to cut its defense budget. In order to save budget for Kongo-class destroyers and other new weapons, Japan made a plan to reduce the size of its tank force. The production of Type 90 therefore slowed down and part of its budget was shifted to the research and development of the new Type 10 main battle tank.

===Transportation===
Being 12 tonnes heavier than its predecessor, the Type 74, the Type 90 was found to be more challenging to operate around Japan, with the exception of Hokkaido. Some politicians therefore criticized the effectiveness of Type 90 due to difficulty in transportation. In fact, more than 65% of major bridges in Japan were still considered passable for the Type 90, while overseas main battle tanks, such as Challenger 2 and Leopard 2, could only use 40% of bridges in Japan.

<text>Fred Albin Ossanna (August 13, 1893 – September 1978) was a Minnesota lawyer who, along with Kid Cann, oversaw the dismantling of the Minneapolis-St. Paul streetcar system as head of Twin City Rapid Transit Company in the 1950s. Ossanna had been hired by Charles Green, a Wall Street speculator who had purchased a large number of TCRT stock shares and ousted D.J. Strouse as head of the company soon after. When it was discovered that Green had connections to organized crime, Ossanna took control. In a period of 22 months ending in June 1954, rails were removed from city streets where trolleys once traveled to be replaced by General Motors buses. 

Ossanna and associate Barney Larrick were both convicted of fraud on August 6, 1960 for activities that had taken place during the conversion from streetcars to buses. Specifically, Ossanna was convicted of six counts of mail fraud, two counts of wire fraud, three counts of fraudulent interstate shipment, and two counts of conspiracy. He was sentenced to two concurrent four-year terms in federal prison and fined $11,000.00. As a result he was disbarred from practicing as an attorney. Ossanna petitioned for reinstatement to the bar in 1970 and the Minnesota Supreme Court, holding he did not &quot;prove by clear and satisfactory evidence&quot; that he was rehabilitated, denied his petition. 
Ossanna had been a prominent local attorney, and left marks in various places. He helped found the Sunset Memorial Park and Funeral Chapel in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1922 by providing funding. In 1938, he had acted as counsel in a debacle known as the &quot;Bemidji Affair&quot; where bidding irregularities had appeared on a project for the Bemidji State Teachers College (Bemidji State University). At some point, Ossanna had done some work for National City Lines, a company that became infamous for buying up streetcar lines and converting them to bus systems.

<doc id="676117" wikidata="Q333362" url="?curid=676117" title="Ian Gilmour, Baron Gilmour of Craigmillar">
<text>Ian Hedworth John Little Gilmour, Baron Gilmour of Craigmillar, (8 July 1926 – 21 September 2007) was a Conservative Party politician in the United Kingdom. He was styled Sir Ian Gilmour, 3rd Baronet from 1977, having succeeded to his father&#x27;s baronetcy, until he became a life peer in 1992. He was Secretary of State for Defence in 1974, in the government of Edward Heath. In the government of Margaret Thatcher, he was Lord Privy Seal from 1979 to 1981.

==Early life==
Gilmour was born in London on 8 July 1926, the son of stockbroker Lieutenant Colonel Sir John Gilmour, 2nd Baronet, and his wife, Victoria, a granddaughter of the 5th Earl Cadogan. His parents divorced in 1929, and his father married Mary, the eldest daughter of the 3rd Duke of Abercorn. The family had land in Scotland and he inherited a substantial estate and shares in Meux&#x27;s Brewery from his grandfather, Admiral of the Fleet, the Hon. Sir Hedworth Meux. They lived in the grounds of Syon Park in London, with a house in Tuscany.

Gilmour was educated at Eton College and read history at Balliol College, Oxford. He served with the Grenadier Guards from 1944 to 1947. He was called to the bar at Inner Temple in 1952 and was a tenant in the chambers of Quintin Hogg for two years.

He bought &quot;The Spectator&quot; in 1954 and was its editor from 1954 to 1959. He sold &quot;The Spectator&quot; to the businessman Harold Creighton in 1967. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote that his editorship had livened up the magazine &quot;publishing new writers such as Bernard Levin and Katharine Whitehorn and taking a strong liberal reforming stance on moral issues such as the death penalty, abortion and homosexuality; he also castigated Eden over Suez.&quot; He had written an editorial denouncing the invasion of Suez as an &quot;act of aggression&quot;.

==Member of Parliament==
He was elected as Member of Parliament for Central Norfolk in a by-election in 1962, winning by 220 votes. He held this seat until 1974, when his seat was abolished due to boundary changes, and he stood for the safe Conservative seat of Chesham and Amersham, sitting as its MP from 1974 until his retirement in 1992.

In parliament, he was a social liberal, voting to abolish the death penalty, and legalise abortion and homosexuality. He also supported the campaign to join the EEC. He was Parliamentary Private Secretary to Quintin Hogg from 1963. He was one of the few members to vote against the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968, regarding it as racist and designed to &quot;keep the blacks out&quot;.

Gilmour espoused the Arab cause when it was less popular in progressive circles than it later became and supported it throughout his years in the House of Commons, where his chief ally was Dennis Walters who was chairman of the Conservative Middle East Council.

===In government===
He served in Edward Heath&#x27;s government from 1970, holding a variety of junior positions in the Ministry of Defence under Lord Carrington: Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Army from 1970 to 1971, then Minister of State for Defence Procurement until 1972, then Minister of State for Defence. He joined the Privy Council in 1973. He replaced Carrington in January 1974 to join Heath&#x27;s Cabinet as Defence Secretary, but lost his position after Labour won the most seats in the general election at the end of February. He was in the Shadow Cabinet after the general election in February 1974 as Shadow Defence Secretary to late 1974. From the end of 1974 to February 1975 he was Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary.

In opposition, Gilmour became chairman of the Conservative Research Department. With Chris Patten, he wrote the Conservative Party manifesto for the October 1974 election – a second loss, by a wider margin. When Margaret Thatcher became the new leader of the Conservative party, she appointed Gilmour as Shadow Home Secretary in 1975, then as Shadow Defence Secretary from 1976 to 1978. He became Lord Privy Seal after the 1979 general election, as the chief Government spokesman in the House of Commons for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, working again under Lord Carrington, who, as Foreign Secretary, sat in the House of Lords. He co-chaired with Carrington the Lancaster House talks, which led to the end of Ian Smith&#x27;s government in Rhodesia, and the creation of an independent Zimbabwe under Robert Mugabe. He also negotiated with the EEC to reduce Britain&#x27;s financial contribution.

===Backbenches and retirement===
Gilmour did not enjoy good relations with Margaret Thatcher. He was a moderate who disagreed with her economic policies, and became the most outspoken &quot;wet&quot;. During a lecture at Cambridge in February 1980, Gilmour contended, &quot;In the conservative view, economic liberalism à la Professor Hayek, because of its starkness and its failure to create a sense of community, is not a safeguard of political freedom but a threat to it.&quot; Thatcher remarked in her autobiography, somewhat sarcastically: &quot;Ian remained at the Foreign Office for two years. Subsequently, he was to show me the same loyalty from the back-benches as he had in government.&quot; Gilmour survived a reshuffle in January 1981, but was sacked in September of the same year. He announced that the government was &quot;steering full speed ahead for the rocks&quot;, and said that he regretted that he had not resigned beforehand.

Gilmour remained on the backbenches until 1992, and opposed many Thatcherite policies, including the abolition of the Greater London Council, rate-capping and the poll tax. He was in favour of proportional representation. In 1989, he was considered by discontented backbenchers as a possible future leader; in the event, he supported Sir Anthony Meyer in his leadership challenge in December 1989. However, he did not participate in frontline British politics again, and was given a life peerage by John Major on 25 August 1992, becoming Baron Gilmour of Craigmillar, &quot;of Craigmillar in the District of the City of Edinburgh&quot;, of which his family were, for several hundred years, the feudal superiors.

In 1999, he publicly endorsed the Pro-Euro Conservative Party in the European Parliament elections, and was threatened with expulsion from the Conservatives as a result. At &quot;Question Time&quot; on 23 June 1999, Prime Minister Tony Blair described the party&#x27;s reaction as a demonstration of how right-wing and anti-European the Conservative Party had become. Gilmour later said that he had stopped paying membership fees in the party after becoming a peer.

Gilmour was president of Medical Aid for Palestinians from 1993 to 1996, and was chairman of the Byron Society from 2003 until his death.

==Writings==
Gilmour was known for writing coherently from the One Nation perspective of the Conservative Party, in opposition to Thatcherism; in particular in his books &quot;Dancing with Dogma&quot; (1992) and (with Mark Garnett) &quot;Whatever Happened to the Tories&quot; (1997), and in his critical articles in journals such as the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;.

His book, &quot;Inside Right&quot; (1977) is an introduction to conservative thought and thinkers. He also wrote the books &quot;The Body Politic&quot; (1969), &quot;Britain Can Work&quot; (1983), &quot;Riot, Risings and Revolution&quot; (1992), and &quot;The Making of the Poets: Byron and Shelley in Their Time &quot; (2002).

==Personal life==
On 10 July 1951, Gilmour married Lady Caroline Margaret Montagu-Douglas-Scott, the youngest daughter of the 8th Duke of Buccleuch and sister of John Scott, 9th Duke of Buccleuch. Their wedding was attended by several members of the British Royal Family, including Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother), and the future Elizabeth II. They lived in Isleworth, and had four sons and one daughter. On 22 February 1974, Lady Caroline Gilmour launched HMS &quot;Cardiff&quot;. His wife died in 2004, but he was survived by their five children, the eldest of whom, the Hon. David Gilmour, succeeded to his father&#x27;s baronetcy. Among the younger sons, Oliver Gilmour is a conductor and Andrew Gilmour (UN official) is a senior United Nations official.

His grandson is the British historian Tim Bouverie.

===Death===
Lord Gilmour died from complications of a stroke and pneumonia on 21 September 2007, aged 81, at West Middlesex Hospital, Isleworth, Greater London.

==Cultural portrayals==
*Gilmour was portrayed by Pip Torrens in &quot;The Iron Lady&quot;, a 2011 biographical film of Margaret Thatcher. In the film, Gilmour voices his concern over the decline of manufacturing in the UK.

<text>Siân Mary Lloyd (born 3 July 1958) is a Welsh television presenter and meteorologist from Maesteg. She was the United Kingdom&#x27;s longest-serving female weather forecaster, having appeared on ITV Weather for 24 years, from 1990 until 2014.

==Biography==
Lloyd was born in Maesteg, Glamorgan, the daughter of two teachers. She attended Ysgol Gyfun Ystalyfera, and in 1975 performed at the Urdd National Eisteddfod where she won the Crown. She graduated with first-class honours from University College, Cardiff (now Cardiff University), before going on to Jesus College, Oxford where she began work for a post-graduate B.Litt. degree in Celtic Studies, but she left after a year without graduating. She has meteorology qualifications from the Met Office College, a distinction, and frequently appears in TV documentaries about the weather.

Lloyd started her media career as a researcher for the &quot;BBC Wales Today&quot; nightly news programme, having responded to an advert in the media pages of &quot;The Guardian&quot;. She then became an announcer for S4C. During a themed premiere for the film &quot;The Avengers&quot; (1998) she dressed in a skin-tight black catsuit, for which she won the prize for best costume.

Whilst working for Worldwide Television News in London, she was asked to work with the Met Office on documentaries about the weather. She then screen tested for the ITV Weather in 1990 and was appointed to a post which had 200 applicants. Lloyd won the Television and Radio Industries Club (TRIC) award for the best TV weather presenter in 2005 and 2007. For a time, she additionally presented &quot;ITV News London&quot; weather forecasts. In February 2014 she left ITV to &quot;pursue new opportunities&quot;.

Proud of being Welsh, she set up SWS (which means &quot;kiss&quot; in Welsh, and standing for &quot;Social, Welsh and Sexy&quot;), a Welsh networking club, in partnership with entertainer Stifyn Parri in the Groucho Club. Bryn Terfel and Siân Phillips are now patrons.

In 2007, Lloyd won the UK Rear of the Year competition, making her the oldest woman to win the title. She also starred as the &#x27;hidden&#x27; celebrity in an episode of the CBBC show &quot;Hider in the House&quot;. Lloyd also helped support Sense-National Deafblind and Rubella Association, and in 2007 attended the launch of the Fill in the Gaps campaign. In March 2008, Lloyd published her autobiography, entitled &quot;A Funny Kind of Love&quot;. In Spring 2010, Lloyd presented the first series of Wedding TV&#x27;s &quot;The Great Cake Bake&quot;.

Lloyd appeared on ITV&#x27;s reality television show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, but was the shock first celebrity to be eliminated by the public vote. She also took part in a celebrity version of the TV show &quot;Total Wipeout&quot; which aired on 18 September 2010.

Lloyd appeared on &quot;Celebrity First Dates&quot; in 2015.

==Personal life==
While at Cardiff University, she met Mark Cavendish, a relative of the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire and now a businessman. They were together for 14 years, often visiting the family seat at Chatsworth House.

From 2002, Lloyd was in a relationship with Lembit Öpik, then the MP for Montgomeryshire, and was engaged to him from 2004 to October 2006. They lived at a house they bought together in Öpik&#x27;s constituency outside Newtown, Powys, and were due to marry in 2006. They had met at a Liberal Democrats conference session where the press meet the MPs, where they talked and she lost a ring. He found it, then lost it himself, then found it again two years later and called her; she had a spare ticket to go to the Proms, and they began a relationship. She appeared on &quot;Celebrity Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?&quot; with Öpik on 15 April 2006, winning £64,000 for charity. In December 2006 it was revealed that the relationship had broken down.

Lloyd met motor racing entrepreneur Jonathan Ashman at Secretary of State for Wales Peter Hain&#x27;s 2007 St David&#x27;s Day party at the Palace of Westminster. Ashman proposed to Lloyd in December 2007, on holiday, at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. Lloyd and Ashman married in 2007 and divorced in 2015 after eight years.

<doc id="676144" wikidata="Q1072658" url="?curid=676144" title="Japanese cruiser Chikuma (1938)">
<text>was the second and last vessel in the of heavy cruisers in the Imperial Japanese Navy. The ship was named after the Chikuma River in Nagano Prefecture. Entering service in 1939, &quot;Chikuma&quot; saw battle during World War II in the Pacific, hunting small allied ships in the Indian Ocean and serving in many escorting missions throughout many large-scale aircraft carrier battles between Japan and the United States. On the 25 of October 1944, she served in the Battle off Samar where she possibly sank the escort carrier USS &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; (though most modern sources attribute the carrier&#x27;s sinking to Battleship &quot;Yamato&quot;) and damaged the destroyer USS &quot;Heermann&quot;, before being crippled by gunfire from the destroyer escort USS &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; and sunk by air attacks.

== Background ==
&quot;Chikuma&quot; was designed for long-range scouting missions and had a large seaplane capacity. She was extensively employed during World War II in conjunction with an aircraft carrier task force, or as part of a cruiser squadron with her sister ship, .

The &quot;Tone&quot;-class cruisers were originally envisaged as the fifth and sixth vessels in the . However, by the time construction began, serious weaknesses in the &quot;Mogami&quot;-class hull design had become clear following the Fourth Fleet Incident in 1935. As Japan no longer was obligated to abide by the limitations of the London Naval Treaty, a new design was created and new means of construction were utilized. Though the external dimensions were close to the &quot;Mogami&quot; class, the design was quite different, with four twin 203 mm (8-inch) main battery turrets placed forward of the bridge, the second super firing over the first, reserving the entire stern area as a large sea plane hangar. Unlike the United States Navy, the Japanese did not have a dual role attack/scout aircraft. No reconnaissance units were assigned to the Japanese carriers, and little emphasis was placed on this aspect of carrier warfare. Instead the Japanese reserved all of their carrier aircraft for attack roles. Reconnaissance was left up to float planes carried by cruisers. &quot;Chikuma&quot; was intended to provide the long range scout planes needed for their carrier Air Fleets.

Chikuma was equipped with the heaviest armor equipped on a Japanese cruiser. It consisted of a main belt 145 mm (5.7-inches) over the citadel, and 150 mm (5.9-inches) over the machinery. She also carried a deck 65 mm (2.55-inches) over the ammo, machinery, and steering spaces and 30 mm (1.2-inches) elsewhere. She was capable of , and could cruise for at 

== Service career ==

=== Early career ===

&quot;Chikuma&quot; was completed at Mitsubishi Nagasaki shipyards on 20 May 1939. After several months as a unit of the CruDiv6 (Sentai 6) of the Second Fleet, she was transferred to the CruDiv8 in November 1939. In addition to taking part in regular combat exercises in Japanese home waters, she operated off southern China on three occasions between March 1940 and March 1941.

=== Early stages of the Pacific War ===
At the end of 1941, &quot;Chikuma&quot; was assigned to CruDiv 8 with its sister ship, &quot;Tone&quot;, and was thus one of the key players in the attack on Pearl Harbor. On 7 December 1941, &quot;Tone&quot; and &quot;Chikuma&quot; each launched one Aichi E13A1 Type 0 &quot;Jake&quot; floatplane for a final weather reconnaissance over Oahu. At 0630, &quot;Tone&quot; and &quot;Chikuma&quot; each launched short range Nakajima E4N2 Type 90-2 Reconnaissance Seaplane to act as pickets and patrol south of the Striking Force. &quot;Chikuma&quot;″s floatplane reported nine anchored American battleships (presumably counting as a battleship). During the subsequent attack, the battleships , , and were sunk and , , , and other smaller ships were damaged.

On 16 December, CruDiv 8 was ordered to assist in the second attempted invasion of Wake Island. Anti-aircraft fire damaged the scout plane from &quot;Chikuma&quot;, which was forced to ditch, but the crew was rescued. After the fall of Wake Island, CruDiv 8 returned to Kure.

On 14 January 1942, CruDiv 8 was based out of Truk in the Caroline Islands, and covered the landings of Japanese troops at Rabaul, New Britain and attacks on Lae and Salamaua, New Guinea. On 24 January &quot;Chikuma&quot;″s floatplanes attacked the Admiralty Islands.

After the air raid on Kwajalein on 1 February by Vice Admiral William Halsey, Jr&#x27;s aircraft carrier , &quot;Chikuma&quot; departed Truk with the Carrier Striking Force in an unsuccessful pursuit. &quot;Chikuma&quot; and &quot;Tone&quot; later escorted carriers during the Raid on Port Darwin, Australia on 19 February, which sank 11 ships to air attacks. From 25 February 1942, &quot;Chikuma&quot; was involved in supporting the Japanese invasion of Java.

=== Battle of the Java Sea ===
On 1 March 1942, &quot;Chikuma&quot;″s floatplane located the 8,806-ton Dutch freighter &quot;Modjokerto&quot; attempting to escape from Tjilatjap to Australia, enabling a flotilla of destroyers to track the freighter down, with the &quot;Kasumi&quot;, &quot;Shiranui&quot;, and &quot;Isokaze&quot; shelling and sinking &quot;Modjokerto&quot; in 3 minutes. That afternoon, CruDiv 8&#x27;s spotted the old destroyer , south-southeast of Christmas Island. &quot;Chikuma&quot; opened fire with her 8-inch guns at the extremely long range of , and all shots missed. &quot;Chikuma&quot; was joined by battleships and , which also opened fire with their 14-inch main batteries, but &quot;Edsall&quot; not only managed to avoid 297 14-inch, 132 6-inch shells from the battleships and an additional 844 8-inch and 62 5-inch rounds from the cruisers, but the destroyer also closed to range and fired its 4-inch guns at &quot;Chikuma&quot;. Hits from &quot;Hiei&quot;, &quot;Tone&quot; and dive bombers from the aircraft carriers and finally stopped &quot;Edsall&quot;, which was then finished off by &quot;Chikuma&quot;.

On 4 March, &quot;Chikuma&quot; and the destroyer &quot;Urakaze&quot; located and sank the 5,421-ton Dutch merchant &quot;Enggano&quot; (which had earlier been damaged by a floatplane from the cruiser ). On 5 March, floatplanes from &quot;Tone&quot; and &quot;Chikuma&quot; took part on the strike against Tjilatjap. After the surrender of the Dutch East Indies, &quot;Chikuma&quot; was assigned to Indian Ocean operations.

=== Indian Ocean raids ===
On 5 April 1942, &quot;Chikuma&quot; was part of a major task force which launched 315 aircraft against British-held Colombo, Ceylon. The destroyer , armed merchant cruiser and 27 aircraft were destroyed and over 500 killed in harbor, and the cruisers and were destroyed at sea. After searching for more remnants of the Royal Navy, the Indian Ocean Task Force launched 91 Aichi D3A1 &quot;Val&quot; dive-bombers and 41 Mitsubishi A6M2 &quot;Zeke&quot; fighters on 9 April against the British naval base at Trincomalee, Ceylon. They found the harbor empty, but wrecked the base&#x27;s facilities and shot down nine planes, and later sank the carrier , destroyer , and corvette , an oiler and a depot ship at sea from base.

The task force with &quot;Chikuma&quot; returned to Japan in mid-April 1942, where it was almost immediately assigned to the unsuccessful pursuit of Admiral Halsey&#x27;s Task Force 16.2 with the aircraft carrier after the Doolittle Raid.

=== Battle of Midway ===
At the crucial Battle of Midway, &quot;Chikuma&quot; and CruDiv 8 were in Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo&#x27;s Carrier Striking Force. On 4 June, &quot;Tone&quot; and &quot;Chikuma&quot; each launched two Aichi E13A1 &quot;Jake&quot; long-range reconnaissance floatplanes to search out for American carriers. The floatplane from &quot;Tone&quot; discovered American ships, but did not recognize that the fleet was a carrier group, which proved to be a crucial mistake. &quot;Chikuma&quot;″s floatplane found the aircraft carrier , and shadowed the ship for the next three hours, guiding the bombers that attacked &quot;Yorktown&quot; that evening. Two other floatplanes from &quot;Chikuma&quot; continued to observe the heavily damaged &quot;Yorktown&quot; through the night, during which time one plane and crew were lost. &quot;Chikuma&quot; then directed the submarine to find and sink the &quot;Yorktown&quot; the following morning.

&quot;Chikuma&quot; and &quot;Tone&quot; were then detached to support Vice Admiral Boshiro Hosogaya&#x27;s Aleutian invasion force. However, the anticipated American counter-attack failed to materialize. CruDiv 8 cruised northern waters uneventfully. &quot;Chikuma&quot; returned to Ominato port on 24 June.

Rear Admiral Chuichi Hara assumed command of CruDiv 8 from 14 July 1942. With the US invasion of Guadalcanal, &quot;Chikuma&quot; and &quot;Tone&quot; were ordered south again on 16 August with the aircraft carriers , , , , and . They were joined by the battleships &quot;Hiei&quot;, &quot;Kirishima&quot;, seaplane tender , and cruisers , , &quot;Takao&quot;, .

=== Battle of the Eastern Solomons ===
On 24 August 1942, CruDiv 7&#x27;s and arrived to join the reinforcement fleet for Guadalcanal. The following morning, a PBY Catalina seaplane spotted &quot;Ryūjō&quot;, which SBDs and TBFs from &quot;Enterprise&quot; unsuccessfully attacked. Seven floatplanes from &quot;Tone&quot; and &quot;Chikuma&quot; were launched to locate the American fleet. One of &quot;Chikuma&quot;″s planes spotted the Americans, but was shot down before its report could be relayed. However, a second floatplane was more successful, and the Japanese launched an attack against &quot;Enterprise&quot;, hitting it with three bombs which set her wooden deck on fire. However, in the meantime, the Americans located the Japanese fleet, and &quot;Ryūjō&quot; was sunk by planes from the aircraft carrier . &quot;Chikuma&quot; was undamaged in this engagement, and returned to Truk safely.

Through October, &quot;Chikuma&quot; and &quot;Tone&quot; patrolled north of the Solomon Islands, waiting word of recapture of Henderson Field by the Japanese.

=== Battle of Santa Cruz ===
On 26 October 1942, northeast of Guadalcanal, Rear Admiral Hiroaki Abe&#x27;s task force launched seven floatplanes to scout south of Guadalcanal. They located the American fleet, and Abe followed with an attack which sank &quot;Hornet&quot; and damaged the battleship and cruiser . However, &quot;Chikuma&quot; was attacked by a Douglas SBD Dauntless dive-bomber from &quot;Hornet&quot;, and quick thinking crewmen jettisoned her torpedoes seconds before a bomb hit her starboard forward torpedo room. She was also hit by two other bombs, destroying one floatplane on the aircraft catapult. &quot;Chikuma&quot; suffered 190 killed and 154 wounded including Captain Komura.

&quot;Chikuma&quot; (escorted by the destroyers and ) returned to Truk for emergency repairs, and was then sent back to Kure with the damaged carrier &quot;Zuihō&quot;. During refit and repairs, two additional twin Type 96 25-mm AA guns and a Type 21 air-search radar were added. Repairs were completed by 27 February 1943.

On 15 March 1943 Rear Admiral Kishi Fukuji assumed command of CruDiv 8, and &quot;Chikuma&quot; was ordered back to Truk. However, on 17 May, &quot;Chikuma&quot; and &quot;Tone&quot; were tasked to accompany the battleship back to Tokyo for the state funeral of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto. &quot;Chikuma&quot; was back in Truk by 15 July, having avoided numerous submarine attacks along the route.

From July to November, &quot;Chikuma&quot; was engaged in making troop transport runs to Rabaul, and to patrols of the Marshall Islands in unsuccessful pursuit of the American fleet. While refueling at Rabaul on 5 November 1943, &quot;Chikuma&quot; and its task force were attacked by 97 planes from the carriers &quot;Saratoga&quot;, and . Cruisers &quot;Atago&quot;, &quot;Takao&quot;, &quot;Maya&quot;, , and were damaged. &quot;Chikuma&quot;, attacked by a single SBD, suffered only near-misses with minor damage.

Back at Kure on 12 December, &quot;Chikuma&quot; gained additional 25-mm AA guns, bringing its total to 20. CruDiv 8 was disbanded on 1 January 1944, and both &quot;Tone&quot; and &quot;Chikuma&quot; were reassigned to CruDiv 7 (with &quot;Suzuya&quot; and &quot;Kumano&quot;) under Rear Admiral Shoji Nishimura. Refit completed by 1 February, &quot;Chikuma&quot; returned to Singapore on 13 February and Batavia on 15 March after a month of raiding commerce in the Indian Ocean. On 20 March 1944, Rear Admiral Kazutaka Shiraishi assumed command of CruDiv 7, and &quot;Chikuma&quot; was made flagship.

=== Battle of the Philippine Sea ===
On 13 June 1944, Admiral Soemu Toyoda activated &quot;Operation A-GO&quot; for the defense of the Mariana Islands. &quot;Chikuma&quot; was assigned to Force &quot;C&quot; Vice Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa&#x27;s Mobile Fleet, which proceeded through the Visayan Sea to the Philippine Sea headed towards Saipan. On 20 June, after the battleships , and carrier were attacked by aircraft from the American carriers , and and the bulk of the Japanese air cover was destroyed in the &quot;Great Marianas Turkey Shoot&quot;, &quot;Chikuma&quot; retired with the Mobile Fleet to Okinawa.

After ferrying army troops to Okinawa, &quot;Chikuma&quot; was reassigned back to Singapore in July, serving as flagship for CruDiv 4 while &quot;Atago&quot; was under repairs.

=== Battle of Leyte Gulf ===

On 23 October 1944, &quot;Chikuma&quot; (with &quot;Kumano&quot;, &quot;Suzuya&quot; and &quot;Tone&quot;) sortied from Brunei towards the Philippines with Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita&#x27;s First Mobile Striking Force. In the Battle of the Palawan Passage, &quot;Atago&quot; and &quot;Maya&quot; were sunk by submarines, and &quot;Takao&quot; damaged. In the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea the following day &quot;Musashi&quot; was sunk, the cruiser was crippled and had to be towed to safety, while the battleships and &quot;Haruna&quot; received damage.

On 25 October, during the Battle off Samar, &quot;Chikuma&quot; engaged U.S. escort aircraft carriers. She managed to close to within 5 nmi (5.8 mi; 9.3 km) of the escort carrier , and landed numerous hits with her 8-inch (203 mm) guns to her flight deck, lighting her ablaze. 

==== Debate on Chikuma&#x27;s role in Gambier Bay&#x27;s loss ====
Going off of older sources of the Battle off Samar, &quot;Gambier Bay&#x27;s&quot; sinking is usually credited to &quot;Chikuma&quot;, as she was known to have fired on her when &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; received her fatal damage, most crucially a hit that flooded her engine room and left her speed dropping drastically until she was dead in the water, and caused catastrophic flooding, usually listed as an 8-inch cruiser shell, likely from &quot;Chikuma&quot;. However, Japanese records display that while &quot;Chikuma&quot; managed to land hits on &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; earlier, she failed to score any hits when &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; received her fatal blows as she switched fire to the destroyer USS &quot;Heermann&quot; beforehand, nor did any other cruiser claim credit for &quot;Gambier Bay&#x27;s&quot; sinking.

However, the battleship &quot;Yamato&quot; claimed numerous hits on a US &quot;fleet carrier&quot; at the exact moments &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; was hit by numerous shells that are commonly attributed as killing blows, including the decisive hit that flooded &quot;Gambier Bay&#x27;s&quot; engine room. On paper, the difference between cruiser shells and battleship shells should have been apparent, but &quot;Yamato&quot;, having mistaken &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; for a full-sized fleet carrier, fired armor piercing shells from her 46 cm (18.1-inch) main guns that over penetrated &quot;Gambier Bay&#x27;s&quot; unarmored hull without exploding. To this day, it&#x27;s still occasionally debated on whether &quot;Chikuma&quot; or &quot;Yamato&quot; sank &quot;Gambier Bay.&quot; However, general consensus among naval historians has landed on the claim &quot;Gambier Bay&#x27;s&quot; sinking should be credited to &quot;Yamato&quot;, largely ridding &quot;Chikuma&quot; of her former glory.

==== Final moments and sinking ====
Regardless of who sank &quot;Gambier Bay&quot;, as stated earlier, &quot;Chikuma&quot; switched fire from &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; to the aforementioned &quot;Heermann&quot;, and inflicted severe damage. She then came under fire from the destroyer escort . &quot;Chikuma&quot; turned her guns to engage, but the &quot;Sammy B&quot; was so close &quot;Chikuma&quot; could not press down her guns low enough to hit the enemy. However, in exchange, over 200 5-inch (127 mm) shells from the destroyer escort slammed into &quot;Chikuma&quot;, turning her into a floating inferno, and disabling her no. 3 turret. &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; emptied almost the entirety of her ammunition on &quot;Chikuma&quot;, and mostly out of ammo and completely out of torpedoes, the destroyer escort was later sunk by the battleship &quot;Kongō&quot;.

Heavily crippled, &quot;Chikuma&quot; disengaged, but was soon attacked by four TBM Avenger torpedo-bombers. Richard Deitchman, flying from , succeeded in hitting her stern port quarter with a Mark 13 torpedo that severed her stern and disabled her port screw and rudder. &quot;Chikuma&quot;″s speed dropped to , then to , but more seriously, she became unsteerable. At 1105, &quot;Chikuma&quot; was attacked by five TBMs from . She was hit portside amidships by two torpedoes and her engine rooms flooded. At 1400, three TBMs from a composite squadron of ships from and led by Lt. Joseph Cady dropped more torpedoes which hit &quot;Chikuma&quot; portside. Cady was later awarded the Navy Cross for his action. It is generally thought that the Japanese destroyer took off survivors from &quot;Chikuma&quot;, and then scuttled her at in the late morning of on 25 October 1944, but a more recent study suggests &quot;Chikuma&quot; sank from the effect of the air attack, and &quot;Nowaki&quot; only arrived in time to pick up survivors from the water.

On 26 October 1944, &quot;Nowaki&quot; was crippled by gunfire from the cruisers , and and finished off by a torpedo from DesDiv 103&#x27;s USS &quot;Owen&quot;. The ship sank south-southeast of Legaspi, Philippines with about 1,400 men, including all but one of &quot;Chikuma&quot;″s surviving crewmen. The sole survivor from &quot;Chikuma&quot; was a crew member who was not picked up by &quot;Nowaki&quot; and drifted ashore on his own.

&quot;Chikuma&quot; was removed from the navy list on 20 April 1945.

<doc id="676148" wikidata="Q1011954" url="?curid=676148" title="Limekilns">
<text>Limekilns is a historic coastal village in Fife, Scotland. It lies on the shore of the Firth of Forth, around south of Dunfermline and 13 miles (21km) northwest of Edinburgh.

Limekilns has a medieval past as a fishing village, dating back to the 14th century. The town gets its name from its 18th century limestone industry, with lime kilns still found at the near contingent town of Charlestown. Today, the town is popular with tourists and is home to 40 listed buildings by Historic Scotland. The population is 1,450 (2020)

==History and economy==
Unlike the neighbouring village of Charlestown, Limekilns is an old settlement dating back to the 14th century. 
In its early days Limekilns was mainly a fishing village, with the large natural harbour, sheltered by the rocky ridge known as The Ghauts, providing docking facilities for small to medium transport and cargo ships. From here ships traded with the ports in the Baltic Sea and France until the seventeenth century when the Union of the Crowns saw the royal interests move south to London. In the early 14th century there was a port for the town of Dunfermline, called Galletts, at the site of the current settlement of Limekilns, this served as the principal port for the town which lies a few miles inland.

The importance of the local limestone became clear quite early in the village&#x27;s history, being used both as a fertiliser and for the manufacture of mortar used in the construction of stone buildings. Workings using kilns fuelled by charcoal and later coal to convert lime to quicklime grew up, the product being exported from the port along the east coast of Scotland. Today the only tangible legacy of this industry in village is the name Limekilns. In the 1750s the lime industry transferred a mile or so west along the coast to Charlestown, where the ruins of the massive kilns still exist today.

For many centuries Limekilns was also the northern terminus for a ferry linking it to Bo&#x27;ness on the southern side of the Forth. This found an echo in Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Kidnapped&quot;: and it was from Limekilns that David Balfour and Alan Breck were carried across the Forth in a rowing boat.
Soap was also produced from a soapworks located near Caupernaum Pier. The &#x27;Soap Sheds&#x27; still exist and are used as storage facilities. The years of industrial decline meant that most of these industries were lost and Limekilns became just another sleepy coastal village. New housing estates were added during the property boom of the 1970s and 1980s, considerably boosting the size and population of the village.

==Landmarks==
Limekilns sits within the lands which traditionally belonged to the Earl of Elgin of Broomhall House, which overlooks the village. 

The oldest building in the village is The King&#x27;s Cellar, a large property which can be traced back to 1362. It has served many different purposes throughout its long life, notably as a store house, school, library and chapel. It is currently employed as a Freemasons Lodge and is generally not open to the public.

The village has a range of amenities including a primary school, doctor&#x27;s surgery, shops and a Sea Scout Group as well as a Guide unit. The Ship Inn is said to be the &#x27;watering hole&#x27; featured in Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s novel &quot;Kidnapped&quot;.

==Transport==
The Earls of Elgin owned land in the Crossford area in connection with the Elgin Colliery (at Parkneuk and Baldridge Burn, NW of Dunfermline) and the Elgin Railway that ran from the Colliery round Crossford and then down beside Waggon Road and on to Charlestown harbour. The route of the railway and the site of the Elgin Colliery are shown in a map in Chalmers&#x27; book, Historical and Statistical Account of Dunfermline.

To the north, paths run via Pitliver to Crossford and through the estate of the Earl of Elgin and Wester Gellet to Pittencrieff Park at Dunfermline.

==Notable people==
Limekilns is the birthplace of George Thomson.

<doc id="676152" wikidata="Q922116" url="?curid=676152" title="Clarence S. Campbell Bowl">
<text>The Clarence S. Campbell Bowl, or simply the Campbell Bowl, is a team award presented by the National Hockey League (NHL). Named after Clarence Campbell, who served as president of the NHL from to , it has been awarded for different accomplishments throughout its history, serving as a counterpart to the Prince of Wales Trophy since the 1967 NHL expansion by using the same criteria in the opposite competitive grouping. The Campbell Bowl has been awarded to the West Division regular season champions (1967–1974), the Campbell Conference &quot;regular season&quot; champions (1974–1981), the Campbell Conference &quot;playoff&quot; champions (1981–1993), and the Western Conference playoff champions (1993–2020, 2021–present).

Due to a modified playoff format held in 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Campbell Bowl was awarded to the Montreal Canadiens after they defeated the Vegas Golden Knights in the Stanley Cup semifinals.

==History==

The Clarence S. Campbell Bowl was donated by the NHL&#x27;s clubs in recognition of the contributions and services of its namesake, the League President at the start of the Modern Era expansion. Throughout its history it has been a parallel to the Prince of Wales Trophy, using the same criteria in the opposite competitive grouping. From its inception in the season through to it was awarded to the first-place finisher in the West Division during the regular season. With NHL realignment in 1974–75, it was given to the team with the best regular season record in the Campbell Conference (the successor to the West Division) through the season. Beginning with the season, it switched to the Campbell Conference &quot;playoff&quot; champions, and since the season, when the Campbell Conference became the Western Conference, the trophy has gone to the Western Conference playoff champions.

A traditional superstition that is prevalent among many of today&#x27;s NHL players is that no player should either touch or hoist the Campbell (Western Conference champion) or Prince of Wales (Eastern Conference champion) trophies after they have won the conference playoffs; these players feel that the Stanley Cup is the true championship trophy and thus it should be the only trophy that they should be hoisting. Instead of touching the conference trophy, the captain of the winning team merely poses (usually looking solemn) with the trophy, and sometimes, the entire team poses as well. There have been other teams, however, that have ignored the superstition and hoisted the conference trophy and then went on to win the Cup anyway.

The NHL temporarily suspended the conferences and re-aligned the league into four temporary divisions for the 2020–21 NHL season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the semifinal round of the 2021 Stanley Cup playoffs was contested between the winners of the divisional playoffs and they were seeded according to their regular season record. Initially the trophy was not going to be awarded, but it was later decided that the Campbell Bowl would be awarded to the winner of the Stanley Cup semifinals between the North and West divisions. Eventually, Montreal Canadiens (the only Eastern Conference team in that half of the &quot;bracket&quot;) defeated the Vegas Golden Knights to win their first and (barring a further change in the playoff format) only Campbell Bowl in their history.

<text>Wild America is a documentary television series that focuses on the wild animals and wild lands of North America. By the mid-1970s, Marty Stouffer had put together several full-length documentaries that were licensed as prime time network television specials. At that time, he approached the programming managers at Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) about a half-hour-long wildlife series, the first to focus exclusively upon the flora and fauna of North America. PBS signed for the rights to broadcast Marty Stouffer&#x27;s series &quot;Wild America&quot; in 1981. The series went on to become one of the most popular aired by PBS, renowned for its unflinching portrayal of nature, as well as its extensive use of film techniques such as slow motion and close-ups. Stouffer earned as much as $250,000 per show from PBS.

The show&#x27;s production ran from 1982 to 1994. The series is no longer on PBS; reruns still air in syndication on commercial television through much of the United States. In 1997, Warner Bros. released a full-length feature film of the same name, which was based on the biographical story of Marty Stouffer and his brothers, Mark and Marshall. The show is now distributed by Storrs Media and Telco Productions for Syndication.

== Episodes ==

The &quot;Wild America&quot; series contained a total of 120 half-hour episodes.

<text>The de Havilland DH.110 Sea Vixen is a British twin-engine, twin boom-tailed, two-seat, carrier-based fleet air-defence fighter flown by the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm from the 1950s to the early 1970s. The Sea Vixen was designed by the de Havilland Aircraft Company during the late 1940s at its Hatfield aircraft factory in Hertfordshire, developed from the company&#x27;s earlier first generation jet fighters. It was later called the Hawker Siddeley Sea Vixen after de Havilland was absorbed by the Hawker Siddeley Corporation in 1960.

The Sea Vixen had the distinction of being the first British two-seat combat aircraft to achieve supersonic speed, albeit not in level flight. Operating from British aircraft carriers, it was used in combat over Tanganyika and over Yemen during the Aden Emergency. In 1972, the Sea Vixen was phased out in favour of the American-made McDonnell Douglas Phantom FG.1 interceptor. There have been no flying Sea Vixens since 2017.

==Development==

===Origins===
In 1946, the de Havilland Aircraft Company conducted discussions with the British Admiralty on its requirements for a future jet-powered all-weather, radar-equipped fighter. From these talks, it became clear that the aircraft would need a crew of two to handle its radar and navigation equipment, as well as to fly the fighter, and that two engines were required for a safety factor over the ocean, and that swept wings were desirable. The fighter would also have a moderate wing loading for manoeuvrability at altitude and acceptable takeoff and landing performance from aircraft carriers. Highly effective wing flaps would be needed for landing and taking off.

de Havilland decided to pursue development of a design to meet the requirements of the British Royal Navy. The proposed aircraft, which was designated as the DH.110 by de Havilland, was a twin-engined all-weather fighter.
The design of the DH 110 used the twin-boom-tail design layout of the de Havilland Vampire and de Havilland Venom. It had an all-metal structure, 45-degree swept wings, and an armament of four 30 mm ADEN cannons. The DH 110 was to be powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet engines, each capable of generating of thrust, which would allow the aircraft to become supersonic in a shallow dive. The DH 110 had the distinction of being the first British two-seat combat plane to achieve supersonic speed.

In January 1947, specifications N.40/46 and F.44/46 were issued by the British Air Ministry for similar night fighters to equip the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) and Royal Air Force (RAF). de Havilland submitted its proposal for the DH 110 to both services. As initially submitted the RAF version had Metrovick F.9 engines, although these would soon be known as the Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire when Metrovick sold its engine division.

In response, nine DH 110 prototypes were ordered for the RAF (together with four of the competing Gloster Javelin) and four prototypes for the Fleet Air Arm.

By early 1949 the DH.110 design was expected to be adaptable to fulfil four requirements: F4/48, F5/49 (a long range RAF fighter), N.40/46 (naval night fighter) and N.8/49 (naval strike aircraft). To this end the prototypes required would be three for F.4/48, four for common RAF and RN development, and two each for the other three roles and by July the authorities were ready to order the 13 prototypes 

In 1949, however, the Royal Navy decided to procure the de Havilland Sea Venom which, as a development of an existing aircraft, was cheaper, and would be available sooner to meet its immediate needs for a jet-powered night fighter to replace its fleet of piston-engined de Havilland Sea Hornets and Vought F4U Corsairs. The RAF decided to cut its order to two prototypes. Despite this setback, de Havilland elected to continue work on the DH 110 while trying to recapture official interest in the type.

On 26 September 1951, an initial prototype was completed and conducted its maiden flight from the Hatfield Aerodrome, flown by the test pilot John Cunningham. Early flight tests of the prototype demonstrated that the aircraft&#x27;s performance exceeded expectations. By the following year, the prototype was regularly flying in excess of the speed of sound.

However, tragedy struck while the first prototype DH 110 (serial number WG236) was demonstrated at the Farnborough Airshow on 6 September 1952. Following a demonstration of its ability to break the sound barrier during a low level flight, the aircraft disintegrated and debris landed in the midst of spectators killing 31 people, including the crew of two, the test pilot John Derry and his flight-test observer, Tony Richards.

Subsequent investigation of the accident traced the failure to faulty design of the wing leading edge section ahead of the main spar. The design had been satisfactory for the earlier Vampire and Venom but not for the higher stresses induced by the rolling pull-out manoeuvre at 650 mph flown by the DH110 prototype at Farnborough. The leading edge skin, without the extra reinforcing structure that would be added later, buckled, which resulted in the outer portions of the swept-back wings being torn off (similar display routines had been flown on preceding days by the other prototype DH110 which had an aerodynamic fence providing external stiffening for the skin located precisely over the area where the buckling originated.). The subsequent shift in the DH 110&#x27;s centre of pressure caused the aircraft to pitch up, the cockpit and tail sections breaking away and the engines being torn from the airframe by the g loading. One of the engines hit an area crowded with spectators at the end of the runway, causing the majority of the deaths. Sixty other spectators were injured by debris from the cockpit landing close to the main spectator enclosures alongside the runway. This incident led to a restructuring of safety regulations for air shows in the UK, and no member of the public died as a result of a British airshow flight for more than 62 years, until the crash of a Hawker Hunter warbird killed 11 people during the Shoreham Air Show on 22 August 2015.

===Redesign and navalisation===
In response to the loss of the first prototype de Havilland introduced modifications to the design which were implemented on the remaining second prototype. These changes included the adoption of an all-moving tailplane, and cambered leading edge extensions. The modified prototype did not return to flight until July 1954. As a result of these changes the DH 110 was no longer able to exceed the speed of sound, only reaching Mach 0.95 in a steep dive where its controls were immovable until passing . By this time, the Royal Air Force announced the abandonment of its interest in the DH 110, after deciding to buy the Gloster Javelin instead; However, the Fleet Air Arm had decided that it would adopt the aircraft as a replacement for its interim fleet of Sea Venoms. In February 1955, an order was placed for 110 navalised aircraft, which received the name &quot;Sea Vixen&quot;.
In addition to tailoring the aircraft for carrier-based operation by the Royal Navy, de Havilland implemented major changes to the Sea Vixen during its redesign. Throughout the 1950s, when the DH 110 design was still being evolved, major advances had occurred in subsystems such as weaponry, fire-control system, radar equipment, and cockpit instrumentation. The concept of an aircraft being an integrated weapons system had proliferated, where sensors such as the radar would be more directly tied into navigation and weapons systems. de Havilland included this concept in the design of the Sea Vixen. According to aviation author David Hobbs, it was the first British fighter aircraft to be designed in this manner.

In June 1955, a semi-navalised prototype, &quot;XF828&quot;, was completed for the purpose of conducting carrier flight deck suitability trials. For this purpose, XF828 featured several changes, including the alteration of the profile of the wing leading edges and the strengthening of the wings, as well as underwing fixture points for catapult launches, and a tailhook for arrested landings; however, the prototype lacked a wing folding mechanism, or racks for armaments. On 20 June 1955, this aircraft made its first flight from de Havilland&#x27;s facility at Christchurch Airfield in Dorset. The following year, XF828 performed its first arrested deck landing on the Royal Navy&#x27;s aircraft carrier .

In April 1956, the finalised production drawings were formally issued. The fully navalised production Sea Vixen featured a number of improvements over earlier development models. These included the addition of a powered folding wing system, reinforcement of the landing gear to withstand the additional stresses of carrier landings, a steerable nose wheel, a revised tail unit, and the redesigning of the fuselage to carry armament. On 20 March 1957, the first true Sea Vixen, designated as the &quot;Sea Vixen FAW.20&quot; (fighter all-weather, later redesignated &quot;FAW.1&quot;), performed its first flight. This aircraft was promptly used for clearance trials, in particular for addressing handling problems; the second production aircraft was used for engineering trials and the third aircraft for conducting radar trials. On 2 July 1959, the first Sea Vixen-equipped squadron was formed.

Production Sea Vixens were manufactured at first by de Havilland at its former World War II Airspeed Ltd. &quot;shadow factory&quot; at Christchurch near Bournemouth, starting in March 1957. In August 1962, all production was moved to another de Havilland factory located at Hawarden, near Chester.

===Further development===
Beyond the initial &quot;FAW.1&quot; model, de Havilland proceeded with the development of an improved variant, which was subsequently designated as the &quot;Sea Vixen FAW.2&quot;. This served as the successor to the FAW.1 and included many improvements. As well as Firestreak missiles, it could carry the Red Top air-to-air missile, four SNEB rocket pods, and the AGM-12 Bullpup air-to-ground missile.

Its enlarged tail boom allowed for additional fuel tanks in the &quot;pinion&quot; extensions above and in front of the wing leading edge, there was an improved escape system and additional room for more electronic countermeasures (ECM) equipment. However, the changes in aerodynamics meant that the 1,000 lb bomb could no longer be carried. Visually the FAW.1 and FAW.2 could be distinguished by the tail booms which extended forward over the wing leading edges of the FAW.2.

In 1962, the Sea Vixen FAW.2 conducted its maiden flight; the type entered service with frontline squadrons in 1964. Overall, a total of 29 FAW.2s were newly built along with a further 67 FAW.1s that were rebuilt and upgraded to FAW.2 standard. In 1966, the original FAW.1 begun to be phased out. In 1972, the career of the Sea Vixen FAW.2 came to an end.


The Sea Vixen FAW2 could be armed with up to four Red Top infrared-homing missiles. The Red Top could home on to heat sources generated by kinetic heating of a fast-approaching supersonic target such as the Tupolev Tu-22 bomber. The Red Top system was integrated into the AI 18R (R for Red Top) radar. From 1969 the Sea Vixen FAW2 practiced intercepts of a supersonic target against the Concorde SST in flight tests over the Irish Sea.

The Admiralty had planned to replace the Sea Vixen with the McDonnell Douglas Phantom FG.1. The aircraft carriers HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot; and were both planned to be refitted to properly carry and fly the new fighters. Due to defence cuts, and following the decommissioning of HMS &quot;Eagle&quot;, only HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot; underwent the conversion work to fly the new Phantom FG.1.

A small number of Sea Vixens subsequently saw service as drones, in which capacity they were redesignated as the &quot;Sea Vixen D.3&quot;. Only four aircraft were converted to the D.3 standard, though three more were dispatched to Farnborough to undergo conversion, but ultimately went unconverted. The last remaining airworthy Sea Vixen (XP924) was a D3 conversion. A number of other Sea Vixens became target tugs and were redesignated as the &quot;Sea Vixen TT.2&quot;.

==Design==
The de Havilland Sea Vixen was a jet-powered fleet defence fighter, equipped with a modern radar and air-to-air missiles for its primary role. When it entered service, it was the first British aircraft to be solely armed with missiles, rockets and bombs; this made it the first fighter aircraft operated by the Fleet Air Arm with no gun armament. The Sea Vixen FAW.1 was armed with four de Havilland Firestreak air-to-air missiles, while the Sea Vixen FAW.2 could also carry the later, more capable Red Top missile. The original DH.110 design offered to the RAF was armed with four cannon before soon being replaced with an all-missile armament. The Red Top homing head was pointed in the direction of the target by slaving it to the AI18 radar, which was operated by the observer.

In addition to its principal fleet-defence role, the Sea Vixen was also used in the ground-attack role for which it could be armed with two Microcell unguided two-inch (51 mm) rocket packs, Bullpup air-to-ground missiles, and four or two bombs. The Sea Vixen was equipped with a refuelling probe for aerial refuelling from tanker aircraft to extend its range. It could also be equipped as a tanker for refueling other aircraft. The Sea Vixen FAW.1 was cleared to carry the Red Beard free-fall nuclear bomb in the event of an &quot;extreme operational emergency&quot;.

The Sea Vixen was powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce Avon 208 turbojet engines and could reach a maximum speed of and a range of up to . It had a twin-boom tail configuration, as used on the earlier de Havilland Sea Vampire and Sea Venom fighter aircraft. The internal volume of the tail boom was used for both fuel and avionics, and was considerably enlarged for this purpose on the improved Sea Vixen FAW.2. The twin-boom tail reduced the length and height of the aircraft, which reduced the stowage area and head-room required onboard aircraft carriers; it also minimised asymmetry during single engine flying, reduced the length of the jet pipes and improved maintenance access.
The fuselage comprises several sections, the principal being the one-piece central and stub-wing assembly section. The front fuselage, composed of the pressurised cabin, the airbrake below the pressure flooring and the radar compartment, and its hinged radome are mounted upon four attachments on the forward face of the front spar. Various electrical compartments are located aft of the front spar, above the wing, which are accessible through hatches. The engines are installed within the main fuselage aft of the main box; they could be removed from the fuselage for servicing via detachable panels on the upper fuselage surface. Sections of the fuselage skin were chemically milled while other parts were machine milled. The powered folding wing made use of a pair of wing-fold joints which involved a total of six main attachment points.

The Sea Vixen had a crew of two, a pilot and a radar operator. The pilot&#x27;s canopy was offset to the left-hand side of the fuselage, while the radar operator sat to the right completely within the fuselage, the latter gaining access to his position through a flush-fitting top hatch, nicknamed the &quot;Coal Hole&quot;. The observer&#x27;s position was darkened and located deeper down into the fuselage, improving the visibility of the radar imagery. Both positions were fitted with fully automated height adjustable Martin-Baker Mk.4 ejector seats, which were capable of being deployed under a range of conditions and circumstances, including the aircraft being submerged in water. Each crew member had a single centralised service connector comprising circuits that served ventilated g-suits as well as controls for humidity and temperature for crew comfort. The windscreen of the pilots canopy had a &#x27;knife edge&#x27; positioned in center for rain and weather shedding.

The flying controls of the Sea Vixen were relatively complex with a fully powered tailplane, ailerons, and rudder; these controls remained usable even in the absence of electrical power, such as in the event of a double engine failure. Actuation of the powered flight control surfaces was provided by a pair of independent hydraulic systems and typically featured variable gearing of control movements over differing speeds. An intricate three-section flap arrangement was employed, partially due to the nature of the wing&#x27;s geometry. The navigation, flight instrumentation and communications equipment included ground and air position indicators, a reference gyro, an autopilot capable of maintaining altitude and speed as well as yaw and pitch damping, tactical air navigation system (TACAN), and ultra high frequency (UHF) radio system.

==Operational history==

The aircraft did not take part in any true wars during its career with the Fleet Air Arm though it took part in many operations. In 1961, President Abdul Karim Kassem of Iraq threatened to annex the neighbouring oil-rich state of Kuwait. In response to Kuwait&#x27;s appeal for external help, the United Kingdom dispatched a number of ships to the region, including two fleet carriers. Sea Vixens aboard the fleet carriers flew patrols in the region, and Kassem&#x27;s aggressive actions wilted in the face of the strong naval presence, thus averting a war over Kuwait.

In January 1964, trouble flared in the East African state of Tanganyika after the 1st and 2nd Tanganyika Rifles mutinied against the British officers and NCOs who, despite Tanganyika being independent, still commanded the regiment. The mutineers also seized the British High Commissioner and the airport at the capital Dar es Salaam. The UK responded by sending the light fleet carrier , accompanied by 45 Commando, Royal Marines. The Sea Vixens, flying off &quot;Centaur&quot;, performed a number of duties including the providing of cover for the Royal Marines who were landed in Tanganyika by helicopters. The operation &quot;to restore Tanganyika to stability&quot; ended in success. That same year, Sea Vixens of HMS &quot;Centaur&quot; saw service once again in the Persian Gulf, including the launch of air strikes against rebel forces, this time supporting British forces fighting against locals disgruntled by the loss of tolls in the Radfan. Later in 1964, HMS &quot;Centaur&quot;″s 892 Squadron Sea Vixens stationed off Indonesia, helped to prevent an escalation of President Sukarno&#x27;s Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation.
Sea Vixens saw further service during the 1960s, performing duties on Beira Patrol, a Royal Navy operation designed to prevent oil reaching landlocked Rhodesia via the then Portuguese colony of Mozambique. The Sea Vixen also saw service in the Far East. In 1967, once again in the Persian Gulf, Sea Vixens helped cover the withdrawal from Aden. There were a number of Royal Navy warships involved, including the carriers , and HMS &quot;Eagle&quot; (carrying the Sea Vixens) and the LPD (Landing Platform Dock) .
The Sea Vixen&#x27;s tactics against faster supersonic fighters such as the BAC Lightning and the Dassault Mirage III was to keep turning until its opponents went low on fuel and then catch them with the Red Top when they tried to break away using afterburner.

The Sea Vixen also flew in an aerobatic role, performing in two Royal Navy display teams: Simon&#x27;s Sircus and Fred&#x27;s Five.

Of the 145 Sea Vixens constructed, 55 were lost in accidents. Two DH.110 development prototypes were also lost. The 55 Sea Vixens lost represented a loss rate of almost 38%. 30 (54%) of these were fatal incidents, 21 of which involved the death of both pilot and observer.

A small number of Sea Vixens were sent to FR Aviation at Tarrant Rushton airfield for conversion to D.3 drone standard, with some undergoing testing at RAF Llanbedr before the drone programme was abandoned. Among them was XP924, now G-CVIX, the only Sea Vixen to remain in flying condition, which has now been returned to 899 NAS colours. Formerly owned and operated by De Havilland Aviation, G-CVIX could be viewed at their hangar at Bournemouth Airport in Dorset and at air shows around the UK. The Air Accident Investigation Branch published an enquiry into damage suffered by G-CVIX on landing at Bournemouth on 5 April 2012. On 16 September 2014, G-CVIX was transferred to Naval Aviation Ltd., a subsidiary of Fly Navy Heritage Trust and will be based at the Royal Naval Air Station Yeovilton in Somerset.

<text>The Französisches Gymnasium () is a francophone gymnasium in Berlin, Germany. Traditionally, it is widely regarded as an elite high school. It is also the oldest public school in Berlin. Its creation was ordered by Frederick William of Brandenburg.

It is directly operated by the Agency for French Education Abroad (AEFE), an agency of the French government.

==History==
It was founded in 1689 by Frederick William&#x27;s son Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg for the children of the Huguenot families who had settled in Brandenburg-Prussia by his invitation, being persecuted for their Protestant beliefs in the Catholic Kingdom of France after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes by King Louis XIV in October 1685. Its first headmaster was the French jurist Charles Ancillon from Metz.

Since its foundation, the school has had an almost continuous history, occupying several buildings in Berlin. In the beginning, the faculty comprised Huguenot refugees only and the language of education was French. The school soon was attended also by numerous German children of school fee paying Prussian nobles and officials, and developed into an elite school.

In the course of the Prussian reforms, the Collège Français became a common public school in 1809. In view of the growing numbers of pupils, it moved into a larger building built on Reichstagsufer in the Dorotheenstadt quarter in 1873. The school was attended by an above-average number of Jewish pupils, who under the Nazi regime — like Jewish teachers — were harassed and finally excluded in 1938. However, despite all nationalist efforts, the French language remained the medium of teaching. After 1943 the school was evacuated from Berlin and the historic school building on Reichstagsufer was destroyed in 1945.

After the war, the school moved to the Wedding district in the French sector of what was to become West Berlin. In 1952 the Französisches Gymnasium — Collège Français Berlin was re-established by merging the traditional Huguenot school with the Berlin collège of the French Armed Forces.

Several of its pupils (though not all graduated) became prominent in later life, among them the poet Adalbert von Chamisso, the authors Maximilian Harden and Kurt Tucholsky, the engineer Walter Dornberger and the resistance fighter Adam von Trott zu Solz, the songwriters Reinhard Mey and Ulrich Roski, as well as political scientist Gesine Schwan, the presidential candidate of the Social Democratic Party of Germany in 2009.

==Today==
The school moved to its current building, in Berlin-Tiergarten, on Derfflingerstraße, not far from Nollendorfplatz
in 1972, after it had been located in Berlin-Reinickendorf. It educates both German- and French-speaking pupils from francophone countries all over the world. Grades are from 5 to 12, with bilingual classes and teaching starting in grade 7. Other languages that are taught are English, Latin, Ancient Greek and Spanish. Pupils can graduate with either of two diplomas though many Germans pass both: the Abitur (German high school diploma) and the Baccalauréat (French high school diploma).

<doc id="676178" wikidata="Q1627719" url="?curid=676178" title="Sale of the Century">
<text>Sale of the Century (stylized as $ale of the Century) is an American television game show that originally debuted on September 29, 1969, on NBC daytime. It was one of three NBC game shows to premiere on that date, the other two being the short-lived game shows &quot;Letters to Laugh-In&quot; and &quot;Name Droppers&quot;. The series aired until July 13, 1973, and a weekly syndicated series began that fall and ran for one season.

The rights to the show were purchased in 1980 by Australian TV mogul Reg Grundy, who produced a similar show called &quot;Great Temptation&quot; in the 1970s. Grundy subsequently launched an Australian version of &quot;Sale of the Century&quot;. Grundy&#x27;s modified format was then used in a revived American &quot;Sale of the Century&quot; that aired on NBC from January 3, 1983, to March 24, 1989. It was one of three NBC game shows premiering on the same date, along with &quot;Hit Man&quot; and &quot;Just Men!&quot; (both of which aired for only 13 weeks), and—like its predecessor—spawned a syndicated edition that ran from January 7, 1985, to September 12, 1986. Grundy&#x27;s format has also been adopted in other countries.

The game consists of contestants answering general knowledge questions. At certain points during the game, the player currently in the lead is offered an &quot;Instant Bargain&quot;, a prize to keep regardless of the game&#x27;s outcome, in exchange for a certain amount deducted from that contestant&#x27;s score.

Actor Jack Kelly hosted the original series from 1969 to 1971, then decided to return to acting full-time. He was replaced by Joe Garagiola, who hosted the remainder of the daytime series plus the one season in syndication. Jim Perry then hosted both the NBC and syndicated 1980s versions. Al Howard was the executive producer of the initial 1969–1974 version, and for a short time was co-executive producer of the 1980s version with Robert Noah.

A short-lived revival of the series entitled &quot;Temptation&quot;, like the 2005 Australian revival, debuted in syndication on September 10, 2007, following a September 7 preview on MyNetworkTV. This series ran for one year.

==Game format==
Contestants answered general knowledge toss-up questions posed by the host, earning $5 for a correct answer or losing that amount for a miss. Unlike most other game shows of the time, though, only the first contestant to buzz in could answer a question; a miss took it out of play for the other two.

At certain points during the game, the contestant in the lead participated in an &quot;Instant Bargain&quot; and was offered the opportunity to purchase merchandise at a bargain price. The selling price for the item, generally the value of one or more questions, was then deducted from the contestant&#x27;s score, and the prize was theirs to keep regardless of the game&#x27;s outcome.

Depending upon the version, question values either remained at $5 or increased as the game progressed. Additional Instant Bargains were also offered. The contestant in the lead at the end of the game was declared the champion and used their final score to purchase a larger prize, or played a separate end game, which varied depending upon the version of the show.

===1969–1974===
From 1969 to 1973, the game featured three contestants, who all began with $25. Midway through the game, the question values doubled to $10. At first, the final round consisted of 30 seconds of $15 questions. Later, this was replaced with five $20 questions (called &quot;The Century Round&quot;, as the total value of the questions was $100). If a contestant&#x27;s total was reduced to zero (or lower), that contestant was eliminated from the game.

At certain points during gameplay, all contestants were offered the opportunity to purchase merchandise at a bargain price. The first contestant to buzz in after the prize was revealed purchased that prize, and the price was deducted from his or her score. The prices of all prizes offered were expressed much as one would hear in a department store (ending with &quot;and 95 cents&quot;), and the prices increased as the episode progressed (e.g., $7.95, $11.95, $14.95, $21.95). All prize values were rounded up to the nearest dollar before being subtracted from the score of the contestant who purchased the prize. Each Instant Bargain was hidden behind a curtain, and contestants could not buzz in before the curtain opened. A contestant who did buzz in early was penalized by having the cost of the Instant Bargain deducted from their score and being locked out of purchasing the prize.

The &quot;Open House&quot; round was played in early episodes of the original version, usually about halfway through a particular episode. Five prizes were presented to the contestants and each could buy as many of them as he or she wanted; they had five seconds to list each of the items they wanted to buy. Unlike Instant Bargains, multiple contestants could buy the same item. This was later replaced with an &quot;Audience Sale&quot; round in which three members of the studio audience guessed the &quot;sale price&quot; of an item. The one that bid closest without going over won the item. The three contestants could increase their score by correctly guessing which audience member would win.

During the last thirteen weeks of this series, and the aforementioned follow-up weekly syndicated series, two married couples competed instead of three individual contestants. Each couple was given $20 at the start of the game. On the syndicated version, the first round consisted of questions worth $5, and in the second questions were valued at $10. A series of five questions worth $20 each were asked to conclude the game. If either couple&#x27;s score reached $0, both couples were given an additional $20.

The winning contestant or couple was given the opportunity to spend their score on at least one of several grand prizes at the &quot;Sale of the Century&quot;. Contestants either purchased a prize with their winnings and retired, or elected to return the next day and try to win enough to buy a more expensive prize. Champions could buy more than one prize. Also, when contestants chose to return the next day, they were asked which prizes they were considering buying. As long as the contestant kept winning, those prizes remained while others were replaced by more expensive ones.

The 1973–74 syndicated version featured two different formats. Both offered three possible prizes (almost always a trip, a fur coat, and a car), only one of which the couple could win. Originally, each prize had a sale price, and Garagiola asked questions worth $100 each, which was added to the couple&#x27;s score from the game. When the amount reached the sale price of a prize, the couple could buy the prize or keep playing for a more expensive prize. Later, this was changed to &quot;The Game of Champions&quot;. The three prizes had sale amounts ($150, $300, and $600). The winning couple chose a prize and had to answer three questions (worth $50, $100, or $200 each, depending on the prize) in order to win.

===1983–1989===

====Original format====
Three contestants competed each day, usually a returning champion and two challengers, and were each given $20 at the start of the game. Except for Fame Game questions, contestants earned $5 for a correct answer and were penalized $5 for an incorrect answer. A contestant&#x27;s score, however, could not be reduced below $0. Contestants could buzz-in before the question was finished, but had to answer based only on whatever information the host had read to that point; only one contestant could answer a question.

Three Instant Bargains were played per game, with the prizes&#x27; retail values and sale prices increasing as the game progressed. In some cases, the host would reduce the price and/or offer extra cash to entice a contestant to make a purchase. During an Instant Bargain, only the player in the lead could purchase the prize available; in the event of a tie, the first player to buzz-in (if any) received the prize. For a brief time in early 1984, any contestant who bought an Instant Bargain could win back the money they spent by correctly answering a &quot;Money Back Question&quot; immediately afterward. Also, on occasion, any Instant Bargains that were not bought would be packaged as part of a &quot;Garage Sale&quot;. If the player(s) in the lead did not elect to buy the Garage Sale package, the other contestants were invited to buy the prize set, unlike the normal Instant Bargains.

Three Fame Game rounds were played per game as well. The first half of each round consisted of a &quot;who-am-I?&quot;-style question, starting with obscure clues and proceeding to easier ones as the host continued. A contestant who buzzed in with a correct answer played the second half of the round; giving an incorrect answer eliminated a player from the round, but with no score penalty. If none of the contestants answered correctly, the second half of the round was skipped.

The contestant who answered correctly was given a choice of nine spaces on the Fame Game board, each displaying the face of a celebrity. Eight of the spaces hid either small bonus prizes or various amounts of cash, some of which offered the contestant a choice between taking either the money or an extra turn. Hidden behind one space was a $25 Money Card, which added that amount to the contestant&#x27;s score. Spaces were removed from play as they were revealed. After the third playing, the host asked three final $5 toss-up questions to end the game.

The contestant with the highest final score became the champion. If the match ended in a tie, the tied players were asked one more question (originally in the Fame Game format, soon changed to an ordinary toss-up). Buzzing in and answering correctly won the game, while answering incorrectly resulted in a loss. In both cases, the losing contestants kept all cash and prizes they had accumulated, including their final scores in cash.

====Bonus Round====
The champion was given a chance to buy a bonus prize with the money earned in all main game wins to that point. Six individual prizes were offered, which changed every five shows, and were arranged in ascending order of both retail value and sale price. A new champion was always allowed to buy the least expensive prize for either its sale price or the entire first game winning score, whichever was lower.

After a win, the champion could either buy any affordable prize of their choice and retire from the show, or return to play another match in the hopes of winning enough money to afford a higher-level prize. A defeated champion left with only the cash and prizes accumulated in the main game. Prizes on the uppermost levels included expensive jewelry, fur coats, and opulent trips with first-class accommodations, with a luxury automobile as the most common top prize.

Any champion who reached the top prize level was offered a chance to continue playing in the hope of earning enough money to buy all six shopping prizes, referred to as &quot;the Lot.&quot; For the first five months of the NBC run, any champion who purchased the Lot also received enough cash to bring its value up to $95,000. Later, a progressive jackpot was added to the Lot and made available for purchase by itself as a seventh prize level. This jackpot began at $50,000 and grew by $1,000 for every day it went unclaimed. The syndicated series used a similar prize structure, but its seventh level consisted only of the Lot without the jackpot.

On rare occasions, a champion would enter a match needing a certain amount for one prize (such as a fur coat) and win with a high enough score to reach the one above it (such as a car). When such a situation arose, unless the winning amount was enough to allow him/her to buy the entire Lot, the champion was allowed to buy either of the two prizes but not both. On the syndicated series, the rule was modified slightly and added the penultimate level of all of the shopping prizes on stage; if the champion earned enough to reach that level, choosing to leave at that point would automatically result in him/her winning each individual prize as opposed to being able to choose the highest valued individual prize of the car.

All the shopping prizes were swapped out for different ones every five shows. If a contestant&#x27;s reign was to continue past the Friday of a particular week, the host offered a reminder that a different set of prizes would be offered beginning on the next show and told the champion what the next available prize in line would be.

====Later changes====
=====Main game=====
By July 1983, the Fame Game underwent two changes. The first involved the use of three Money Cards, worth $10, $15, and $25, which were added to the board one at a time in ascending order. Occasionally, a fourth card worth $5 was placed on the board with the $10 card. Later in March 1984, the famous faces on the Fame Game board were replaced by numbers, and for a brief time in late 1984, there was a &quot;$5+&quot; Money Card, entitling the contestant who found it to immediately pick another number and receive whatever was behind it in addition to the $5 score boost. Even later, in October 1985, a randomizer was added to the Fame Game board and the player in control hit their buzzer to freeze it and thus choose a number, similar to the CBS game show &quot;Press Your Luck&quot;. When this change was made, the locations of the Money Cards were shown to the players and the $5 card was discontinued.

The regular game format also underwent a significant change in March 1984 when the series followed the Australian &quot;Sale&quot; lead by replacing the final three questions after the last Fame Game with a 60-second speed round. Beginning in May 1984, a &quot;Sale Surprise&quot; was occasionally and secretly added to certain Instant Bargains. It was only revealed after the contestant either purchased or passed on a prize, and consisted of a cash bonus in addition to any money the host might have already offered.

In March 1986, the third Instant Bargain was replaced by an &quot;Instant Cash&quot; game. The leading contestant was offered a chance at a cash jackpot at the cost of their entire lead over the second-place player. In case of a tie, the host named a starting price and gradually lowered it until one contestant buzzed in. Accepting the deal gave the player a choice of three boxes, two of which contained $100 each. The third box held the jackpot, which started at $1,000 and increased by that amount every day it went unclaimed.

Beginning in late December 1987, a prize was awarded to the winner of the match. Originally, there were six prizes on offer each week, each hidden behind a number, and the winner of the game received one of them. The prize was determined at first by the champion&#x27;s selection of one number during the game, and later by the winner&#x27;s selection at its end. Beginning in August 1988, the prize was predetermined before the show and the host announced it at the beginning of the match.

=====Bonus round #2: The Winner&#x27;s Board=====
The shopping bonus round was later replaced with a game called the &quot;Winner&#x27;s Board&quot;, which was introduced in October 1984 on NBC and on November 18, 1985 in syndication. On the Friday before the switch was made on both series, the champion was awarded the highest-level shopping prize he/she could afford with the money accumulated to that point.

Unlike the shopping format, in which the champion took the risk of being defeated and leaving without a bonus prize if he/she chose to play a new game, the Winner&#x27;s Board guaranteed that the champion would receive a prize after every victory. A new champion faced a full board of 20 squares, with 10 prizes available. The two largest prizes, a car and $10,000 cash, were each hidden behind one square, while eight smaller prizes (always including $3,000 cash) were behind two squares each. Two &quot;WIN&quot; cards were also hidden on the board. Prizes were changed out at the end of each broadcast week.

The champion selected one square at a time and won the first prize matched. Uncovering a &quot;WIN&quot; card automatically awarded the next prize found; this was the only way to win either the car or the $10,000 after any of the champion&#x27;s first eight victories. No special bonus or prize was awarded for finding both &quot;WIN&quot; cards on consecutive turns.

Once a prize was won, it was removed from play for all subsequent visits to the Winner&#x27;s Board by that champion, but the two &quot;WIN&quot; cards were always in play. After a ninth victory, these cards were removed and two numbers were displayed, each concealing one of the two remaining prizes. The champion picked one number and won its prize, then automatically received the other one for a tenth win. If a champion was defeated before clearing the board, he/she kept all prizes won to that point.

Any champion who won all 10 prizes from the board was given the option to retire undefeated or put those prizes at risk in one final match against two new challengers on the next show. A win awarded a $50,000 bonus in addition to all previous winnings, while a loss forfeited all the Winner&#x27;s Board prizes.

=====Bonus round #3: The Winner&#x27;s Big Money Game=====
In December 1987, the show changed bonus rounds again and introduced a new round called the &quot;Winner&#x27;s Big Money Game&quot;. At the start of this round, the champion selected one of three envelopes, each containing a set of six-word puzzles that served as clues to a famous person, place, or thing. To win, the champion had to solve a set amount of them within a time limit. The limit was originally five puzzles in 25 seconds, later reduced to four in 20 seconds. The clock began when the first word of a puzzle was revealed and stopped when the champion hit a plunger and gave an answer. Passing was allowed, and the champion could continue playing after one wrong guess or failure to respond immediately upon hitting the plunger. A second such mistake ended the round immediately.

The Winner&#x27;s Big Money Game had a series of eight prize levels. The first six levels were played for cash prizes that started at $5,000 and increased by $1,000 for each subsequent game the champion won, up to $10,000. The seventh level was played for a car, and any champion who failed to win it was forced to retire. Winning the car allowed the champion to return for one last match, with $50,000 available in the Winner&#x27;s Big Money Game if he/she won.

==Personnel==

The 1969–1974 version began with Jack Kelly as host, who was replaced by Joe Garagiola in 1971. Bill Wendell, then on the staff of NBC, served as announcer for the entire 1969–1974 version. Madelyn Sanders, an African-American model, served as hostess for most of the run, along with several other female models.

The 1980s version was hosted by Jim Perry, who was initially joined by Sally Julian as co-host. Two months later, Lee Menning replaced her until December 28, 1984, when Summer Bartholomew joined the program and remained as co-host until the 1989 finale. Jay Stewart announced until his retirement in January 1988, when he was replaced by Don Morrow.

==Production information==
===Broadcast history===
&quot;Sale of the Century&quot; premiered on September 29, 1969, on NBC&#x27;s daytime schedule at 11:00a.m. (10:00a.m. Central), replacing the two-year-old &quot;Personality&quot;, which was hosted by Larry Blyden. It aired at that time slot for the whole of its initial four years on the network, ending its first run on July 13, 1973, after which &quot;The Wizard of Odds&quot;—the first American program hosted by Alex Trebek—made its debut. Shortly after NBC cancelled the daytime version of the program, it returned in first-run weekly syndication in September 1973, with the same format as in the final NBC weeks. However, relatively few stations took the program, which usually aired on a weeknight before primetime programming, and not enough of them were interested in a second season, so the New York-based production was discontinued in 1974.

The 1983 revival debuted on NBC on January 3 of that year at 10:30a.m. (9:30a.m. Central) and remained there until January 2, 1987. Replacing &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, the show that belonged in the time slot from April 1982 to December 1982, the show faced competition against &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; at the same time slot on CBS (ABC did not begin programming until 11:00a.m.) from January to September 1983, then &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; from September 1983 to January 1986, then &quot;Card Sharks&quot; (a revival of Jim Perry&#x27;s former show) from January 1986 to 1987. On January 5, 1987, the network moved the show ahead thirty minutes to 10:00a.m. (9:00a.m. Central). &quot;Sale of the Century&quot; stayed in that timeslot for the remainder of its run, enjoying respectable ratings. It faced competition with three CBS game shows airing at that same timeslot: &quot;The $25,000 Pyramid&quot; (for the entirety of 1987 and the spring of 1988), &quot;Blackout&quot; (which aired from January to April 1988), and &quot;Family Feud&quot; (which premiered in July 1988); as the late 80&#x27;s progressed, however, NBC affiliates began pre-empting desirable time slots, including the 10:00 am hour, to extend their local or syndicated program offerings, leading to the point that daytime television game shows were no longer considered as a contributing factor. The program&#x27;s 1,578th and final episode aired on March 24, 1989.

Its place on the schedule was taken by Reg Grundy stablemate &quot;Scrabble&quot;, which had been airing in the afternoons for several years, in a shuffle that also saw &quot;Super Password&quot; end after four-and-a-half seasons (its timeslot of 12:00 PM was given back to its affiliates, which had used the slot to air local newscasts at that point) and the soap opera &quot;Generations&quot; inherit &quot;Scrabble&quot;″s old timeslot of 12:30 pm.

The revival series spawned an accompanying daily syndicated edition that premiered on January 7, 1985, and was distributed by Genesis Entertainment. The syndicated &quot;Sale of the Century&quot; was renewed for a full second season, but not enough stations were willing to pick it up for a third season and the series came to an end following the 1985–86 season.

===Episode status===
Most episodes of the original NBC 1969–1973 series are believed to have been destroyed, but nine episodes of that run are held by the UCLA Film and Television Archive. The status of the 1973–74 syndicated run is unknown.

The USA Network aired reruns of the entire 220-episode 1985–86 syndicated series, and 170 episodes (July 1988 – March 1989) of the NBC daytime series from September 14, 1992, to July 29, 1994, for a total of 390 episodes.

GSN carried the series from April 1, 2013, until March 27, 2015. The network initially started out by airing the final sixty-five episodes of the NBC series. As part of the weekend beginning with that year&#x27;s Black Friday, the network aired a four-hour marathon of episodes from the first season of the syndicated series to pay tribute to many retailers offering sales. GSN added the syndicated episodes to its daytime lineup in place of the network episodes that Monday and aired most of the run before dropping &quot;Sale&quot; from their schedule.

On October 18, 2015, Buzzr added the syndicated episodes to their Sunday night lineup, which later moved to the weeknight lineup in the summer of 2017. In July 2018, the show moved to the weekday morning lineup, and in July 2019, the network added NBC episodes to its rotation, starting from episode 1410, in July 1988.

===Theme music===
The original 1969–1974 theme was composed by Al Howard and Irwin Bazelon.

The main theme on the 1980s version was composed in 1982 by Ray Ellis and his son, Marc, and was more or less a reworking of Jack Grimsley&#x27;s original 1980 recording for the Australian version of the show. The show introduced a synthesized version of the Ellis theme in 1987.

==Licensed merchandise==
Milton Bradley released two home editions based on the 1969–1974 version. A version based upon the 1983–1989 version of the show (made by American Publishing Corp and featuring the &quot;Quizzard&quot; game) was released in 1986.

As part of their &quot;Game Show Greats&quot; lineup, IGT released a video slot machine in 2003.

==International versions==
Prior to purchasing the rights to &quot;Sale of the Century&quot; in 1980, media mogul Reg Grundy produced &quot;Great Temptation&quot;, a similar show that aired on Australian television from 1970 to 1974. His Australian version of &quot;Sale of the Century&quot; ran from 1980 to 2001. Reg Grundy Productions distributed the format internationally until 1995 when the company was sold to Pearson Television, which became known as Fremantle in 2001.

<text>Lasse Artturi Virén (born 22 July 1949) is a Finnish former long-distance runner, winner of four gold medals at the 1972 and 1976 Summer Olympics. Virén recaptured the image of the &quot;Flying Finns&quot; promoted by runners like Hannes Kolehmainen, Paavo Nurmi and Ville Ritola in the 1920s. He was elected Finnish Sportsman of the Year in 1972 and 1976 and later became a politician and a member of Finland&#x27;s parliament in 1999–2007 and 2010–2011.

==Biography==
===Early career===
Virén began his running career in the United States at Brigham Young University, in Provo, Utah. Virén ran on the Varsity Cross-Country team for BYU for one season, before returning home to his native Finland. A police officer from Myrskylä, Virén debuted on the international scene in 1971. His performances at the 1971 European Championships in Helsinki were overshadowed by fellow Finn Juha Väätäinen, who captured gold medals in both the 5000 and 10,000 metres events with Virén settling for modest seventh and 17th placings, respectively. According to Virén himself and his coach, Rolf Haikkola, Virén could have placed better in the 1971 European Athletics Championships, if he had done the &quot;emptying exercise&quot; of his system earlier – according to Haikkola, he followed the Finnish Athletics Federation&#x27;s leaders&#x27; bad advice – and if he hadn&#x27;t been pushed almost to the point of falling at the start of the last lap in the 5000 metres final. The &quot;emptying exercise&quot; of top runners means that they push their bodies to a total exhaustion or lack of energy so that their bodies can again receive much energy, and so that they can repeat their top race performances. Shortly after those European Championships, he broke Väätäinen&#x27;s fresh Finnish record at 5,000 metres.

Buoyed by a brutal training regimen in Thomson&#x27;s Falls, Kenya, and very impressive results, which included the smashing of the 2-mile world record and wins against Great Britain and Spain in a meet held in Helsinki in the summer of 1972, Lasse Virén entered the Munich Games as a dark horse.

===1972 Olympics===

At the 1972 Summer Olympics at Munich, Virén won both the 5,000 and the 10,000 metres events. At the 10,000 metres final held on 3 September, Virén broke Ron Clarke&#x27;s seven-year-old world record despite falling in the twelfth lap after getting tangled with Emiel Puttemans. Mohamed Gammoudi also fell after being tripped by Virén&#x27;s legs. In less than 150 metres, Virén caught up with the leading pack after losing about 20 metres. With 600 metres to go, Virén started an unprecedented lap-and-a-half kick to which only Puttemans was able to respond. The Finn won the race in 27:38.35.

Virén became the fourth athlete to win both events in the same Olympics, joining fellow Finn Hannes Kolehmainen (1912), Czechoslovakia&#x27;s Emil Zátopek (1952) and Russian Vladimir Kuts (1956). After them, Miruts Yifter (1980) and Kenenisa Bekele (2008), both from Ethiopia, and Mo Farah from Great Britain (2012 and 2016), accomplished the coveted &quot;double&quot;. However, only Kolehmainen, Virén and Miruts Yifter had to endure 10,000 metres heats to qualify for the 10,000 metres final. In the 5,000-metres final one week later, Viren could keep up with Steve Prefontaine, Gammoudi, Puttemans and Ian Stewart, in the race&#x27;s quick final four laps. He sprinted past Gammoudi with around 110 to 120 metres to go, and won in 13:26.4, one second before Gammoudi. Four days later, despite the wet, chilly and windy weather in the Helsinki Olympic Stadium, he set a new world record at 5,000 metres by running 13:16.4. Six days later, Puttemans broke the record by 3.4 seconds.

One factor in Virén&#x27;s Olympic victories, especially at the 1972 Olympics 5,000 and 10,000 metres, has received little attention: his careful running of almost all the bends (curves) near the inner edge of the first lane, which spared him tens of metres compared to his chief rivals. More specifically, Steve Prefontaine gave Virén an advantage of more than forty metres over 5,000 m in 1972, while Emiel Puttemans gave about fifty metres over 10,000 m, by running many bends wide on the outer edge of the first lane or sometimes even on the second lane. This metre-saving practice is called &quot;bend (curve) mathematics&quot;.

===1976 Olympics===
Virén ran at lower levels between the Olympics. At the 1976 Summer Olympics, Virén again won both events, coined later as the &quot;double double&quot;, and became the first repeat winner of the 5,000 metres race in Olympic history (since joined by Mo Farah). He won the 10,000-metre final comparatively easily, because even Great Britain&#x27;s Brendan Foster dropped from the steadily accelerating pace of Portugal&#x27;s Carlos Lopes at 8,000 metres, and because Lopes back then was unable to radically increase his pace in the last lap or so of track races. Virén passed Lopes at around 9,550 metres and defeated him by 4.79 seconds.

Following his 10,000 metres final win at the Montreal games, he took off his Onitsuka Tiger (ASICS) &quot;Runspark&quot; shoes and waved them to the crowd on his victory lap. The International Olympic Committee accused Virén of malicious intent, such as showing the tiger stripe logo on the shoes, but he claimed that he had a blister. Thus, the IOC suspended Virén from taking place in the 5,000-metres final after qualifying in his heat. An appeal followed and he was allowed to enter the race, two hours before gun time.

In the 5,000 metres final, he held off all-time greats Dick Quax, Rod Dixon and Brendan Foster (all world-class at 1,500 m) with a devastating display of front-running over the last few laps. To those who watched him, the display was awesomely inspiring to the point that his last 1,500 metres in that final would have placed him 8th in the 1,500-metres final held at those Games. The top four runners sprinted to the finish line inside six metres, a rare occurrence in major international championships. He competed in the men&#x27;s marathon, his first marathon and finished fifth in 2:13:11.

===1980 Olympics===

Virén ended his career after the 1980 Summer Olympics, where he placed fifth in the 10,000 metres. Virén qualified for that final, placing fourth and having clocked a disappointing 28:45 in his heat. Only after Ireland&#x27;s John Treacy collapsed during his heat, due to heat stroke, was Virén given an automatic place in the final. Otherwise, he would have qualified for the final as a fastest loser. He pushed that final&#x27;s leading pack until the last 300 metres, before succumbing to the spurt of Miruts Yifter, the eventual gold medalist. Some people claimed that Viren could have run better in the 1980 Olympics if he had not done so much marathon-like training. Viren himself believes that if he had not injured his leg shortly before the Olympics, he would have run clearly better. Another account suggests that the main issues arose from the fact that Virén had neglected to bring a masseur to his months long endurance training camps in Colombia and on the Canary Islands during the preparation phase for the Moscow Olympics, resulting in stiffened leg muscles during the following speed training phase of the preparation, which made the speed training inefficient, caused the above-mentioned injuries, and left him with an insufficient top speed. Viren skipped the 5,000-metres race and chose to compete in the Olympic marathon, where he started quite well, running over 20 kilometres in the lead group. Stomach problems, however, caused him to drop out before 30 kilometres. In the autumn of 1980, he announced his retirement from active competitive running.

=== Outside the Olympics ===
After a complex leg surgery early in 1974, and between his Olympic double victories, he won a bronze medal in the 5,000 m at the European championships behind the British athlete Brendan Foster with a time of 13:24.57. Two days later, in Helsinki, Virén won a 5,000 m race in 13:26.0, defeating Anders Gärderud (Sweden). Three days after this Helsinki race, Virén again encountered Foster in a 2-mile (3.2-km) race at the Coca-Cola international meet in London at the Crystal Palace. Foster was again victorious, with Virén finishing fourth, only 0.06 seconds behind the second place runner. Virén recorded his fastest 10,000 m for the 1974 season with a winning time of 28:22.6 at a Finland vs. Soviet Union international meet on 21 September.

Virén had broken the world records for both the 2-mile and the 5,000 m outside the Olympics. Both were done in close proximity to the 1972 Olympics: his 8:14.0 for two miles was on 14 August 1972 and his 13:16.4 for a 5,000 m race on 14 September 1972.

Virén&#x27;s success outside the Olympics in running near his best Olympic-year times was better in 5,000m events than in 10,000m ones. Virén broke 13:36 in the 5000m consistently outside Olympic years and sometimes even broke 13:30. At 10,000m he only broke 28 minutes in the Olympic years.

In 1979, Virén competed in New Zealand, running the summer international series there while in the midst of his endurance training for the Moscow Olympics of 1980.

Established in 1977 by the Finnish sculptor Eino Romppanen, the Lasse Virén Finnish Invitational, later the &quot;Lasse Virén 20K&quot;, was an annual off-road running race in Sycamore Canyon, part of Point Mugu State Park near Malibu, California, held through 2012.

Since his career ended he has become a well-known figure in Finland, eventually holding a seat in the Finnish Parliament with the National Coalition Party from 1999 until 2007 and from 2010 to 2011. Virén did not seek re-election in 2011.

In 2014 Virén was inducted into the International Association of Athletics Federations&#x27; Hall of Fame.

<text>A darkcutter or dark cutter (also known as DFD, or Dark Firm Dry) is a carcass of beef that has been subjected to undue stress before slaughter, and is dark in color. Sometimes referred to as dark cutting beef, they have a dark color which makes the meat appear less fresh, making them undesirable to consumers. Darkcutters fetch a lower price than otherwise ordinary beef on the market.

Desirable meat has a slightly acidic pH level, from 5.3 to 5.7, which is a result of the conversion of glycogen to lactic acid. Poor feeding or handling will mean that no glycogen is available, so lactic acid cannot be produced to lower the pH. Stress &quot;ante mortem&quot; causes a depletion of glycogen stores in the liver and muscles. Thus the glucose normally used &quot;post mortem&quot; to produce ATP anaerobically and in turn resulting in lactic acid production before the development of &quot;rigor mortis&quot;, is unavailable. The muscle pH stays high (above 6.0), resulting in higher water-holding capacity (sticky protein) and more translucent muscle, which looks darker because light travels deeper into the muscle before being refracted.

To prevent and address darkcutting, it is suggested to keep the animals calm and well fed before culling. If the livestock do not consume enough nutrition, or deplete it while stressed by poor handling, the levels of glycogen will be reduced. Severe stress leads to a proportionate depletion in the animal&#x27;s glycogen.

<text>Native Forest Action (NFA) was set up protect the publicly owned native forests of the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand from logging.

The West Coast has extensive stands of virgin native forests and numerous organisations had lobbied for their protection. In 1986 the West Coast Accord was signed between environmental groups and government agencies. There was discord amongst other environmental groups since it was seen to be too much of a compromise towards the logging interests. This should be seen it light of the fact that New Zealand had lost approximately 75% of its original forest cover since human habitation.

In 1997 the NFA campaign involved protesters setting up camps in the forest and tree sitting. In April 1997, one of these sites was deliberately destroyed by swinging a tree from a helicopter into it, allegedly without ensuring that it was fully clear of protesters.

NFA had a campaign of non-violent direct action which gained it prominence in the media. The New Zealand Labour Party made an election promise in 1999 to halt the logging. One of the most controversial parts of campaign history was when a bomb was found on a helicopter used for logging. NFA, which had always maintained a policy of non-violence denied vigorously any links to the bomb, and no link was found.

It is claimed that the release of the book &quot;Secrets and Lies&quot; by Nicky Hager prior to the 1999 general election had an influence on the election of the Labour Party. The book made detailed claims about an organised smear campaign against NFA by public relations firm Shandwick on behalf of Timberlands West Coast, the company tasked with sustainably harvesting West Coast beech forests. The Labour/Alliance coalition government halted the logging and the land was transferred to the Department of Conservation.

NFA, which as an organisation always had a very informal structure, is now dormant.

<doc id="676228" wikidata="Q130274" url="?curid=676228" title="Astarte">
<text>Astarte (; , ) is the Hellenized form of the Ancient Near Eastern goddess ʿAṯtart. ʿAṯtart was the Northwest Semitic equivalent of the East Semitic goddess Ishtar.

Astarte was worshipped from the Bronze Age through classical antiquity, and her name is particularly associated with her worship in the ancient Levant among the Canaanites and Phoenicians, though she was originally associated with Amorite cities like Ugarit and Emar, as well as Mari and Ebla. She was also celebrated in Egypt, especially during the reign of the Ramessides, following the importation of foreign cults there. Phoenicians introduced her cult in their colonies on the Iberian Peninsula.

==Name==
The Proto-Semitic form of this goddess&#x27;s name was . While earlier scholarship suggested that the name was formed by adding the Afroasiatic feminine suffix to the name of the deity , more recent views accept the names and as being etymologically related while considering the exact relationship between them to be unclear. The meaning of the names and are themselves still unclear.

The Masoretic Text vocalization is in dispute: most scholars consider it as an artificial superimposition of the vowels of the Hebrew word &quot;bōšet&quot; (&quot;shame&quot;) upon the consonants of the original name; some other suggest it is a result of the Canaanite shift from /ā/ to /ō/ (despite the unexpected occurrence of the shift in this position), or, with an assumption of an early form *, as a conventional occurrence of the shift &quot;-ā(r)i-&quot; to &quot;-ō(r)ē-&quot;.

==Overview==
In various cultures Astarte was connected with some combination of the following spheres: war, sexuality, royal power, beauty, healing and — especially in Ugarit and Emar — hunting; however, known sources do not indicate she was a fertility goddess, contrary to opinions in early scholarship. Her symbol was the lion and she was also often associated with the horse and by extension chariots. The dove might be a symbol of her as well, as evidenced by some Bronze Age cylinder seals. The only images identified with absolute certainty as Astarte are these depicting her as a combatant on horseback or in a chariot. While many authors in the past asserted that she has been known as the deified morning and/or evening star, it has been called into question if she had an astral character at all, at least in Ugarit and Emar. God lists known from Ugarit and other prominent Bronze Age Syrian cities regarded her as the counterpart of Assyro-Babylonian goddess Ištar, and of the Hurrian Ishtar-like goddesses Ishara (presumably in her aspect of &quot;lady of love&quot;) and Shaushka; in some cities, the western forms of the name and the eastern form &quot;Ishtar&quot; were fully interchangeable.

In later times Astarte was worshipped in Syria and Canaan. Her worship spread to Cyprus, where she may have been merged with an ancient Cypriot goddess. This merged Cypriot goddess may have been adopted into the Greek pantheon in Mycenaean and Dark Age times to form Aphrodite. An outdated argument, however, postulates that Astarte&#x27;s character was less erotic and more warlike than Ishtar originally was, perhaps because she was influenced by the Canaanite goddess Anat, and that therefore Ishtar, not Astarte, was the direct forerunner of the Cypriot goddess. However, evidence from Iron Age Phoenicia show that Astarte became a more erotic goddess as opposed to her early Bronze Age worship in Ugarit and Syria, and that early attestations of Aphrodite, were more war-like. 

Greeks in classical, Hellenistic, and Roman times occasionally equated Aphrodite with Astarte and many other Near Eastern goddesses, in keeping with their frequent practice of syncretizing other deities with their own. In addition, certain aspects of other Greek gods, such as Artemis Astrateia are hypothesized to be heavily influenced by Astarte.

Major centers of Astarte&#x27;s worship in the Iron Age were the Phoenician city-states of Sidon, Tyre, and Byblos. Coins from Sidon portray a chariot in which a globe appears, presumably a stone representing Astarte. &quot;She was often depicted on Sidonian coins as standing on the prow of a galley, leaning forward with right hand outstretched, being thus the original of all figureheads for sailing ships.&quot; In Sidon, she shared a temple with Eshmun. Coins from Beirut show Poseidon, Astarte, and Eshmun worshipped together.

Other significant locations where she was introduced by Phoenician sailors and colonists were Cythera, Malta, and Eryx in Sicily from which she became known to the Romans as Venus Erycina. Three inscriptions from the Pyrgi Tablets dating to about 500 BC found near Caere in Etruria mentions the construction of a shrine to Astarte in the temple of the local goddess Uni-Astre (). At Carthage Astarte was worshipped alongside the goddess Tanit, and frequently appeared as a theophoric element in personal names.

==Iconography==
Iconographic portrayal of Astarte, very similar to that of Tanit, often depicts her naked and in presence of lions, identified respectively with symbols of sexuality and war. She is also depicted as winged, carrying the solar disk and the crescent moon as a headdress, and with her lions either lying prostrate to her feet or directly under those. Aside from the lion, she&#x27;s associated to the dove and the bee. She has also been associated with botanic wildlife like the palm tree and the lotus flower.

A particular artistic motif assimilates Astarte to Europa, portraying her as riding a bull that would represent a partner deity. Similarly, after the popularization of her worship in Egypt, it was frequent to associate her with the war chariot of Ra or Horus, as well as a kind of weapon, the crescent axe. Within Iberian culture, it has been proposed that native sculptures like those of Baza, Elche or Cerro de los Santos might represent an Iberized image of Astarte or Tanit.

==Attestations==
===At Ebla===
The earliest record of ʿAṯtart is from Ebla in the 3rd millennium BC, where her name is attested in the forms () and ().

===In early Mari===
The main cult centre of ʿAṯtart was Mari, where early texts from her temple pre-dating the city&#x27;s destruction by the Akkadian Empire record her name as (), who appears to have been distinguished from ʿAṯtart&#x27;s East Semitic equivalent, the Mesopotamian goddess Ištar, at Mari.

One text from Mari records that offerings were made to both ʿAṯtarat and the river-god Nārum together.

===Among Amorites===
====In Amorite Mari====
The main cult centre of ʿAṯtart was still the city of Mari during the Amorite period, when her name is attested as a theophoric element in personal names such as (, ). However, her name was otherwise written in cuneiform using ideograms and without the feminine suffix , in the forms () and ().

A contemporary incantation against snakebites from Ugarit recorded the existence of a manifestation of ʿAṯtart who resided in Mari.

====At Ugarit====
At Ugarit, the local variant of ʿAṯtart, (), was devoid of any astral aspects or associations with ʿAṯtar, and she played a minor role in mythological texts, but was often mentioned in Ugaritic ritual and administrative texts, thus suggesting that she was important for the institution of the royalty.

ʿAṯtartu at Ugarit was associated with the goddess Anat, with Anat usually preceding ʿAṯtartu, and the two goddesses were often connected to each other through poetic parallelism. Both goddesses shared common traits such as perfect beauty, which characterised young goddesses, with the human Ḥuraya being compared to them in the text &quot;KTU 1.13 III&quot; using the terms (. ), in which Anat and ʿAṯtartu were connected through poetic parallels.

Another trait which both Anat and ʿAṯtartu shared was their love of war, and their pairing appears to have been due to their common roles as beautiful hunters and warrior goddesses. The Ugaritic ʿAṯtartu nevertheless did not yet possess the erotic traits of the later Canaanite ʿAštart.

=====As hunter goddess=====
In the text &quot;KTU 1.92&quot;, ʿAṯtartu is called (, ) in the lines 2-3, with the next line mentioning her as (, ). The following lines recorded that the goddess saw something whose name is lost due to damage to the text, and line 5 mentions that the deeps surge with water, which might either refer to a celestial sign or to a possible damp terrain where ʿAṯtartu was hunting. The lines 6-13 described ʿAṯtartu taking cover in the low ground and holding her weapons while hunting, and she finally slew an animal whose name is lost in line 14. Following this, ʿAṯtartu fed the animal she had slain to the gods El and Yarikh.

Thus, present in the Northwest Semitic goddess was present a trait which was also characteristic of the South Arabian masculine hypostasis of ʿAṯtar, in whose honour sacred hunts were performed as fertility rite. This hunter aspect of ʿAṯtartu later faded away by the 1st millennium BC.

In the later portion of the text &quot;KTU 1.92&quot;, ʿAṯtartu was given clothing, after which she is described as (), meaning either raising a shadow like the stars, implying that ʿAṯtartu herself was brilliant and removed a shadow like the stars do, or as herself shining like the stars. This passage leads to another one in which Baal desires ʿAṯtartu for her beauty, and approaches her.

ʿAṯtartu also appears as a huntress in the text &quot;KTU 1.114&quot;, where she and her sister Anat are consistently described as hunting together and bringing back game whose meat they distributed to the gods. In this text, ʿAṯtartu is mentioned before Anat, unlike most Ugaritic texts where this order is inverted, although the two goddesses are again connected through poetic parallels in the lines 10 to 11, reading (, ).

=====As warrior goddess=====
Attestations of ʿAṯtartu as a warrior goddess at Ugarit are minimal, with the principal one being her role in the text &quot;KTU 1.2 I 40&quot;, where she and Anat together restrain Baal by holding, respectively, his left and right hands. This text also linked ʿAṯtartu and Anat through poetic parallelism in the lines (, ).

The Ugaritic text &quot;KTU 1.86&quot;, the (, ), mentions the horses of ʿAṯtartu, which might possibly be another allusion to her role as a warrior.

Possibly due to her role as a goddess of warfare, ʿAṯtartu was sometimes mentioned alongside the god Resheph in Ugaritic texts, such as in administrative documents, with jars of wine for the temples of ʿAṯtartu and of Resheph- being respectively mentioned immediately after each other in the text &quot;KTU 4.219&quot;, and in the text &quot;KTU 1.91&quot; mentioning that the (). Moreover, the attribute animal of Resheph was the lion, which was analogous to the lioness being the symbol of the warrior goddess ʿAṯtartu.

=====As healer goddess=====
In the text &quot;KTU 1.114&quot;, ʿAṯtartu and Anat also went to hunt for ingredients to cure the drunkenness of El, to whose household they belonged, and they are later mentioned in the narrative as applying the components of the cure to cause the healing, thus connecting the two goddesses with healing.

Among the Ugaritic incantations mentioning ʿAṯtartu are two where she is invoked to protect against snakebites: in the first incantation, from the text &quot;KTU 1.100&quot;, which is part of a sequence addressed to the sun-goddess Shapash to be delivered to a succession of deities, she is mentioned immediately after Anat, and the two goddesses&#x27; names are combined in the form (, ), and the incantation itself is intended to be delivered to Anat&#x27;s home at ʾInbubu, thus putting ʿAṯtartu on a secondary level compared to Anat. ʿAṯtartu was also mentioned on the side of the tablet on which the inscription was written. In this incantation, the first instance of ʿAṯtartu was that of ʿAṯtartu of Ugarit, while the second one was ʿAṯtartu of Mari.

In a second incantation against snakebites, from the text &quot;KTU 1.107&quot;, ʿAṯtartu was mentioned after Anat in a pairing of the two goddesses as part of a list also including pairings of Baal and Dagon, and Resheph and Yarikh.

A third incantation, from the text &quot;KTU 92.2016&quot;, either against fever or for good childbirth, mentioned (, ), followed by (, ), itself in turn followed by (, ), suggesting that this incantation alluded to three distinct water bodies.

=====As leonine goddess=====
ʿAṯtartu&#x27;s emblem was the lion, and she was explicitly called a lioness and a panther in the hymn &quot;RIH 98/02&quot;, which reads:
The hymn especially emphasizes ʿAṯtartu and her name, with its mention of the goddess as &quot;name&quot; possibly being connected to her role as the Name-of-Baal, and the second line calls her a &quot;lioness&quot; while the fourth and fifth lines liken her to a panther. This association of ʿAṯtartu with the lion corroborates with significant comparative evidence from ancient West Asia and North Africa:
* ʿAṯtartu&#x27;s East Semitic equivalent, (), also had a lion as her attribute animal;
* one of ʿAṯtartu&#x27;s Egyptian hypostases, the goddess Qetesh, is depicted standing on a lion on a plaque where she is given the triple name of (, );
* ʿAṯtartu herself was identified with multiple lion-goddesses in Egypt;
* the Phoenician goddess Tanit, whose name was linked to that of ʿAṯtartu&#x27;s later Phoenician iteration, ʿAštart, was represented with a lion&#x27;s head;
* the masculine counterpart of ʿAṯtartu, ʿAṯtaru, was also called (, ).

ʿAṯtartu in her form as a lioness might have been invoked as a theophoric element in the personal names (, ), and (, ), the latter of which holds the same meaning as the personal names () and (), both meaning &quot;Servant of ʿAṯtartu.&quot;

=====As gender non-conforming goddess=====
Although divine roles were often modelled on human ones, such as masculine gods in relation to patriarchy and kingship being represented like human men, and feminine goddesses in relation to marriage and domestic chores being represented like human women, the exceptional roles of ʿAṯtartu and ʿAnatu as hunter and warrior goddesses signalled them as being at odds with the social norms of the societies where human women were not supposed to hunt of which they were deities.

This characterisation is made explicit in the myth of Aqhat, where Aqhat exclaims to Anat, (), meaning either &quot;now do womenfolk hunt?&quot; as a question, or &quot;now womenfolk hunt!&quot; sarcastically, to contrast her with human women, who were not supposed to hunt.

Thus, while Baal and Resheph were both hunter gods whose roles as such made them conform to masculine gender roles, the roles of ʿAṯtartu and Anat as hunter and warrior goddesses constituted an inversion with respect to the gender roles of human women. This made them role models and mentors, as Anat does in the story of Aqhat, in which she addresses him with the intimate term &quot;my brother&quot; and tells him that she will instruct him in hunting, thus being able to bond with the addressee and be present and active in him development into an accomplished hunter.

The episode of ʿAṯtartu performing filial duties by &quot;shutting down the jaws&quot; of the enemies of El was another case of gender inversion where the goddess successfully performed actions which among mortals were reserved for men only.

======Manifestations======
One of the manifestations of ʿAṯtartu attested in the Late Bronze Age was (), whose name has been variously interpreted as ʿAṯtartu of the Hurrians, ʿAṯtartu of the Grotto or Cavern, ʿAṯtartu of the Tomb(s), or ʿAṯtartu of the Window, and was also recorded at Ugarit in Akkadian as (), and as ().

Some Ugaritic texts identified ʿAṯtartu with the Hurrian goddesses (, called () in Ugaritic), and (, called (), and supporters of the interpretation of the name ʿAṯtartu Ḫurri as &quot;ʿAṯtartu of the Hurrians&quot; suggest that this manifestation of ʿAṯtartu was the one identified with the Hurrian goddess Šauška.

Other possible manifestations of ʿAṯtartu at Ugarit might have included () and (), of still uncertain meaning, with the latter being affixed with the title (, ).

=====As member of the household of El=====
In in the hymn &quot;RIH 98/02&quot;, ʿAṯtartu is called on to &quot;shut the jaw of El&#x27;s attackers&quot; in the line (, ), which finds a literary parallel in the myth of Aqhat, where the titular hero Aqhat is instructed to (, ), thus signaling ʿAṯtartu as performing filial duties by protecting El, the patriarch of whose household she was a member of.

=====As consort of Baal=====
Although there is little to no evidence of ʿAṯtartu being explicitly considered the consort of Baal at Ugarit, the text &quot;KTU 1.114&quot; did refer to Baal as sexually desiring ʿAṯtartu, with possible mention of a bed in line 32 of the text perhaps alluding to these two deities engaging in sexual intercourse.

Although the once widespread view that Anat was also a consort of Baal has recently fallen out of favour due to lack of evidence from Ugarit, indirect evidence, such as Egyptian adaptations of West Semitic myths in which both ʿAṯtartu and Anat were the consorts of Baal might constitute indirect evidence that this might also have been the case at Ugarit.

Sacrifice to ʿAṯtartu might have been included in the list of sacrifices for the family of Baal in the Ugaritic text &quot;KTU 1.148.16&quot; possibly because ʿAṯtartu might have been regarded as the consort of Baal at Ugarit. Contemporary sources, including Egyptian adaptations of West Semitic myths which feature ʿAṯtartu and Anat as the brides of Baal, and later sources, such as the role of the Phoenician ʿAštart as the consort of Baal, also suggest that ʿAṯtartu was a consort of Baal, although this evidence is still very uncertain and this pairing appears to have been distinctly Levantine.

======As the &quot;Name of Baal&quot;======
Another connection between ʿAṯtartu and Baal was through her name (, ). This name defined the identity of the goddess as being in relation to Baal.

ʿAṯtartu&#x27;s role as the Name-of-Baal might also have been connected to the use of Baal&#x27;s name as a magical weapon, such as in the text &quot;KTU 1.2 IV 28&quot;, where one line reads (, ), in reference to ʿAṯtartu invoking the power of Baal&#x27;s name and his titles, such as (, ) and (, ), to hex the god Yammu.

=====Cult=====
The Ugaritic deity-lists gave minimal importance to ʿAṯtartu in the realm of rituals, and she was the last mentioned in several of these, although she was nevertheless important politically for the ruling dynasty of Ugarit and the administration of that city-state, being thus associated with the institution of the monarchy. In one letter to the king of Ugarit concerning maritime commercial activities with Cyprus, the lines 6 to 9 read (, ), placing Baal and ʿAṯtartu in the initial position and naming ʿAṯtartu first, before the other Ugaritic goddesses, indicating the political importance of ʿAṯtartu at Ugarit.

The temple of ʿAṯtartu was likely located within the city of Ugarit, perhaps within the complex of the city&#x27;s royal palace itself, with administrative records mentioning the existence of cultic personnel devoted to the goddess at this temple, the Ugaritic Akkadian text &quot;RS 20.235&quot; referring to a servant of the goddess and the text &quot;KTU 4.163&quot; mentioning singers of ʿAṯtartu, while the text &quot;KTU 4.219&quot; contains the record of a payment of silver for the temple of the goddess immediately before that of a payment for the temple of the god Resheph.

Ugaritic administrative texts also mentioned the use of wine in the royal rituals pertaining to ʿAṯtartu, with the ritual text &quot;KTU 1.112&quot; mentioning the offering of a jar of wine to the goddess&#x27;s manifestation of ʿAṯtartu Ḫurri.

The texts &quot;KTU 4.242 I 1&quot; and &quot;11&quot; mention clothing for the statue of (,), who was identified with the North Syrian goddess (, ), with ʿAṯtartu Šadî herself being referred to as Ištar Ṣēri in Akkadian texts from Ugarit. Ištar Ṣēri was invoked as a divine witness in an oath between the kings of Ugarit and Kargamiš, further attesting of her importance for the royalty of Ugarit, and she appears to have been popular enough in northern Syria and the Hittite Empire that she was worshipped in Hatti, where her name was written as ().

Although ʿAṯtartu had none of the erotic traits of her later Canaanite variant, ʿAṯtartu Šadî/Ištar Ṣēri was nevertheless present in hierogamy royal entry rituals whereby a statue or a woman representing the goddess was inserted in the alcove of Ugarit&#x27;s royal palace.

Due to these aspects of the goddess, Akkadian texts from Ugarit and Emar identified ʿAṯtartu with her Mesopotamian counterpart Ištar, with the Akkadian milieu within which the Ugaritic texts were composed not distinguishing ʿAṯtartu from Ištar, and the Akkadian text &quot;RS. 17.22 + 17.87&quot; from Ugarit referred to a second temple of hers as the &quot;-temple of Ištar.&quot;

====At Emar====
ʿAṯtart was imported from the Levant into the Amorite city-state of Emar during the Late Bronze Age, where she received a major cult and possessed a temple at the highest point of the city of Emar itself, with a treasure of existing there of (, ). Like at Ugarit, she did not exhibit any astral traits and was not associated to her masculine counterpart, ʿAṯtar.

ʿAṯtart was worshipped at Emar, where, like at Mari, the name of the goddess was written in cuneiform using ideograms and without the feminine suffix , in the forms () and (), while also appearing in ritual texts and onomastica there. ʿAṯtart at Emar was worshipped under various manifestations, such as:
*, variously interpreted as &quot;ʿAṯtart of the Sea,&quot; ʿAṯtart as patron-goddess of the abû shrines and of the month Abî, or &quot;ʿAṯtart of the fathers&quot;;
* .()

=====As warrior goddess=====
ʿAṯtart&#x27;s role as a warrior goddess is more attested at Emar due to the widespread reference of the manifestation of ʿAṯtart as (, ), who was also the main basis of the cult of this goddess at Emar.

The warrior role of ʿAṯtart at Emar is also attested in the use of her name as a theophoric element in personal names such as (, ) and ().

The cult of ʿAṯtartu ša tāḫāzi was performed by a priestess called the (), and the participants of her night festival were called the (, ).

=====As hunter goddess=====
ʿAṯtart&#x27;s connection to hunting at Emar in ritual settings is recorded in a text mentioning (, ), that is the hunt of ʿAṯtart, which was performed on the 16th of the month of Abi. This ritual hunt was performed on the same day as the procession to her manifestation of the (, ) from &quot;the storehouse&quot;, which ascribes to ʿAṯtart agricultural traits otherwise unknown of her elsewhere during the Bronze Age.

The line also parallels the Sabaic hallowed phrase (, ), used to refer to the ritual hunts performed for the South Arabian god ʿAṯtar, who was himself a masculine counterpart of ʿAṯtart.

Another Emarite text records that the hunt of ʿAṯtart was performed on the 16th of the month of Marzaḫāni, with the hunt of Baal being on the 17th of this same month, and both hunts being mentioned together in the texts from Emar, suggesting that the hunt of the goddess involved game or provisions, and that ʿAṯtart and Baal appeared together at Emar, likely under the influence of their pairing in the Levant; Baal himself appears as a hunter at Ugarit, but never alongside ʿAṯtart as he does at Emar.

=====As consort of Baal=====
Although it was the pairing of the Hurro-Syrian goddess Ḫebat and Baal which was the principal divine couple at Emar, and despite there being no evidence yet that ʿAṯtart was explicitly paired with Baal at Emar as she was among the Canaanites, ʿAṯtart and Baal nevertheless had temples dedicated in common to both of them, and a common cult to this pair is suggested from the appearance of their names as theophoric elements in the popular personal names (, ) and (, ). There is nonetheless little beyond this curcumstantial evidence at Emar for any pairing of ʿAṯtart with Baal, which appears to have been a Levantine occurrence.

=====Legacy=====
The worship of ʿAṯtart in the Middle Euphrates region, including at Emar, lasted until the Late Bronze Age.

By the Iron Age, the name of ʿAṯtart appears to have become used to mean &quot;goddess&quot; in general, so that an Akkadian inscription from the city of Ḫanat referred to the goddess ʿAnat as (, ).

===In Egypt===
ʿAṯtart was eventually imported into New Kingdom Egypt, where she was renowned as a West Semitic war-goddess and often appeared alongside ʿAnat, with the West Semitic association of the two goddesses having also been borrowed by the Egyptians. Her cult is attested in Egypt from as early as the reign of Amenhotep II in the 15th century BC, and the goddess herself was attested under various manifestations, such as () and (), that is the same form of the goddess whose name in Ugaritic was .

The cult of ʿAṯtart would remain well-established in Late Period Egypt, during the 1st millennium BC, at Memphis, where a significant community of Semitic origin had been living since the New Kingdom, and where a temple of the goddess was part of the city&#x27;s temple of the god Ptah. From at least as early as the 6th century BC, ʿAṯtart was identified with the Egyptian goddess Isis, and a 7th-century BC ivory box discovered at Ur and which had been dedicated to ʿAṯtart by the daughter of one an individual whose name, (Peṭ-ʾIsi), meant &quot;Given by Isis&quot;, might have originated in Egypt.

====As warrior goddess====
Under the 18th and 19th dynasties, ʿAṯtart was depicted either standing or on horseback and holding a sword and shield, and she was sometimes associated to the god Resheph just like she was at Ugarit due to her warrior role, as attested through a stela of Amenhotep II which includes a line mentioning both them together, (, ), and both deities were depicted and mentioned on a private votive stele found at the site of Tell el-Borg in the Sinai.

During this period, some of the Levantine myths regarding ʿAṯtart were translated into Egyptian, as attested by the fragmented Papyrus so-called of &quot;ʿAṯtart and the Sea,&quot; the Egyptian translation of a West Semitic myth in which ʿAṯtart is called a ().

During the 20th dynasty, one of the inscriptions of Ramesses III recording his military victories against the Libyans mentioned ʿAnat and ʿAṯtart in a praise to the king, (, ); and a poem contained the lines (, ), which likened his chariot to the two goddesses.

ʿAṯtart was also worshipped at the Temple of Hibis in the Kharga Oasis, where she is depicted, under the name (), three times on a 5th-century BC relief, followed by Resheph.

During the Ptolemaic period, ʿAṯtart was depicted on a chariot in a relief from the Temple of Edfu, where she is called (, ).

====As ====
The Egyptian goddess Qetesh (), who was depicted on 19th and 20th dynasty Egyptian stelae as a naked goddess with a Hathoric hairstyle, standing on a powerful lion and holding flowers or snakes in her outstretched hands, and often accompanied by Min and Resheph, was a Levantine-Egyptian hypostasis of ʿAṯtart.

====As healer goddess====
In a medical papyrus from the 14th century BC, which contains Northwest Semitic inscription written in Hieratic, the goddess, who is called , appears as a healer, and is mentioned alongside , that is the Northwest Semitic healer-god Eshmun, to whom she would be often found associated later in Iron Age Phoenicia.

ʿAṯtart was still remembered as a huntress goddess during the Iron Age, and she was mentioned as such in a 5th-century BC Aramaic incantation against scorpion stings inscribed in Demotic from the Wādī al-Ḥammāmāt, whose text includes the lines () and ().

====As hunter goddess====
ʿAṯtart in the Wādī al-Ḥammāmāt text was referred to both as &quot;ʿAttar my mother&quot; and &quot;the huntress&quot;, attesting of the continuation of the healer role of this goddess recorded since the Bronze Age at Ugarit, as well as of her pairing with Baal. The incantation&#x27;s invocation of ʿAṯtart and Baal against the &quot;enemy&quot;, that is the scorpion which has stung an individual, parallels the combat of these deities against cosmic or divine enemies in the Ugaritic texts.

====As consort of Set====
In the 20th dynasty text, &quot;The Contendings of Horus and Seth&quot;, ʿAnat and ʿAṯtart are referred to as divine daughters who are also the future wives of the god Set, whom the Egyptians identified with Baal.

A Late Bronze Age seal from Egyptian-ruled Palestine discovered at the site of Baytīn represented ʿAṯtart as a warrior, and was inscribed with the name of the goddess, written as ().

In the story of &quot;ʿAṯtart and the Sea,&quot; which is an Egyptian translation of a Levantine mythological tradition, the Ennead, which in this story stood for the West Semitic divine council headed by El, initially offers tribute to the sea-god Yam to be given to him by the goddess Renenutet, and after this proves to be unsuccessful, they send him more appealing tribute to be delivered to him by ʿAṯtart, who weeps on being informed of this. When she goes to Yam, he sees her singing and laughing and addresses her as a (), and then instructs her to ask the Ennead to give him their daughter, with ʿAṯtart&#x27;s tribute being unsuccessful since it is followed by a conflict between Set and Yam following the Levantine tradition of the contest between Baal and Yammu.

=====As the &quot;Face of Baal&quot;=====
ʿAṯtart was called &quot;Face of Baal&quot; () in the Wādī al-Ḥammāmāt inscription, which defined the goddess as representing the presence of the god Baal, especially in his temple. This usage of the name of a deity to represent their presence is also attested among the Phoenicians, who called the goddess Tanit as (, ), and among Israelites, in the verse of Book of Psalms of the Bible reading (, ). In the 19th century, when Ernest Renan excavated the ruins of Ḥammon, now Umm al-Amad, between Tyre and Acre, he found two Phoenician inscriptions dedicated to a certain sun deity nicknamed Ḥammon. which read:

LMLK&#x27;(Š)TRT&#x27;T ḤMN

Translation:

To &quot;Lord Ashtrt&quot;, Hammon (sun goddess)

A debate between scholars took place over whether it was dedicated to &quot;Moloch-Astarte&quot; or &quot;Queen [Malik] Astarte&quot;.

===In Canaan===
Following the end of the Bronze Age, the Canaanite peoples during the Iron Age continued worshipping ʿAṯtart under the name of (), who was a continuation of her Ugaritic form, ʿAṯtart.

During the 11th to 10th centuries BC, the early Canaanites invoked the lioness aspect of their variant of ʿAštart through inscriptions bearing the name (), meaning &quot;Servant of the Lioness (that is, ), on arrowheads along with the name (), meaning &quot;Son of Anat,&quot; implying that ʿAštart and ʿAnat were the patron-goddesses of the warriors who used these arrows.

====In Phoenicia====
The Phoenician variant of ʿAštart was the goddess (). By the time that the Canaanite Phoenician civilisation had emerged in the 1st millennium BC, ʿAštart overshadowed the other Semitic goddesses in the Phoenician pantheon and had become the main personification of a less war-like and more sensual vitality.

Like her East Semitic equivalent, Ishtar, the Phoenician ʿAštart was a complex goddess with multiple aspects: being the feminine principle of the life-giving force, ʿAštart was a fertility goddess who promoted love and sensuality, in which capacity she presided over the reproduction of cattle and family growth; the goddess was also the consort of the masculine principle of this life-giving force, variously personified as Hadad or Baal, who himself incarnated plant growth and presided over rain, water, springs, floods, and the sprouting and growth of cereals. This pairing of ʿAštart and Baal was later mentioned in the 1st century AD by Philōn of Byblos, who wrote about the goddess Astarte and Zeus (that is, Baal), called Adōdos (itself a Hellenisation of Phoenician ) and Dēmarous, ruling over the land with the consent of Kronos (that is, ʾEl).

As well as the goddess of carnal love and of fertility, ʿAštart was also a warrior goddess, although she no longer exhibited much of the hunter aspect of the Bronze Age ʿAṯtart, which had faded away so that by the 1st millennium BC the hunting scenes on the shrine of the Phoenician ʿAštart at the temple of Bustān aš-Šayḫ depicted her consort in the city-state of Ṣidōn, the god Eshmun, as a male hunter figure; ʿAštart was also a celestial goddess possessing astral traits and who was identified with the Morning Star, and occasionally to the Moon. The dove was a sacred animal of ʿAštart, as, like with her East Semitic equivalent Ishtar, was the lion.

The cult of ʿAštart reached its highest level of prestige among the Phoenicians, in both mainland Phoenicia and thanks to the extensive maritime trade endeavours of the Phoenicians, in the Phoenician, and later Punic, colonies throughout the Mediterranean world, with her worship being recorded in Cyprus, as well as in Punic Africa and Sicily, with the oldest recorded mention of the Phoenician ʿAštart is from an 8th-century inscription from a bronze statuette, often called the Seville statuette or the El Carambolo statuette, which had been imported into Iberia from mainland Phoenicia.

During the Hellenistic period, the Phoenicians identified their own goddess ʿAštart with the Egyptian goddess Isis) due to the influence of the Egyptian Osiris myth on their own conceptualisations of the afterlife and salvation.

Among the Phoenician and Punic personal names containing the name of ʿAštart were (, , already attested in Amorite Mari as ), , and (). 

===== Iconography =====

ʿAštart was often depicted as a naked goddess because of her role as a fertility and sexuality goddess, and many terracotta figures of naked women found in Israel and Judea were depictions of ʿAštart, although not every image of a naked woman from this location was a representation of her. ʿAštart was also depicted in the form of &quot;concubines of the dead&quot; statuettes placed in burials, as well as in sympathetic magic figurines possessing fertile traits intended to ensure that women desiring to have children would become pregnant.

Images of an armed goddess might also have been representation of ʿAštart as a goddess of war and hunting, due to which she was often depicted on horseback or on a war chariot, sometimes holding an epsilon axe.

ʿAštart was often depicted with a &quot;Hathoric&quot; hairstyle, which connected her with the Phoenician ivory sculptures of the woman at the window and to amulets representing a goddess who was analogous to Qetesh. ʿAštart was also sometimes depicted surrounded by twin gods in some Phoenician coins.

===== ʿAštart Ḥor =====
Although the wooden throne upon which the Seville/El Carambolo Statuette rested had perished, its surviving bronze stool was inscribed with a dedication to (), that is to the Phoenician form of the manifestation already attested in pre-Phoenician times, or maybe associated with Ἀφροδίτης λιμνησία, Aphrodite of the salt marshes.

The cult of &quot;ʿAštart Ḥor&quot; held a certain importance, especially as part of royal rituals, and her domains were located at Šuksu, and at Ṣaʾu, a town belonging to the city-state of Siyannu.

===== As the &quot;Name of Baal&quot; =====
Another manifestation of ʿAštart was (, ), who was the Phoenician form of (, ) already attested in the Bronze Age at Ugarit. This name defined the identity of the goddess as being in relation to Baal.

=====At Sidon=====
The worship of ʿAštart at the Phoenician city-state of Sidon dates from the Late Bronze Age, when her name was recorded in Hittite texts, Ugaritic epics, and evocatory formulae.

The royal family of Ṣidōn worshipped ʿAštart, with several of its members bearing names in which the name of ʿAštart appears as a theophoric element, such as (), (), and (), and her title of (, ) being a theophoric element in the name of the 7th century BC Sidonian king (, ).
The kings of Ṣidōn from the 5th century BC, such as Eshmunazar I and his son Tabnit I, included &quot;priest of ʿAštart&quot; as part of their royal titulatory, and while Tabnit I&#x27;s son, Eshmunazar II, who died when he was 14 years old, did not hold the title of &quot;priest of ʿAštart,&quot; his mother Amoashtart was &quot;priestess of ʿAštart.&quot; Before his death, Eshmunazar II and Amoashtart had built a sanctuary of ʿAštart at (Sidon-Land-by-the-Sea), another sanctuary in the city&#x27;s district of &quot;šmm ʾdrm&quot; (the Lofty Heavens), and a third sanctuary for ʿAštart šim Baʿl, with Eshmunazar II&#x27;s cousin and successor Bodashtart having expanded the sanctuary of &quot;Ṣidōn ʾArṣ Yam&quot;.

As attested by three statuettes of children inscribed with dedications reading (, ), which mention ʿAštart along with Eshmun, the 6th to 4th century temple of this god at Bustān aš-Šayḫ where these statuettes were found was in fact a common sanctuary of Eshmun and ʿAštart. A large shrine to ʿAštart was located on the eastern side of the sanctuary, below the platform upon which the temple proper rested, and it contained a paved waterpool and a stone throne flanked with sphinxes dedicated to the Sidonian ʿAštart, which itself rested against the background wall, which was decorated with hunting scenes.

During the period of the middle Roman Empire, a Sidonian coin of the Roman empress Julia Cornelia Paula was issued bearing the image of ʿAštart resting her right arm on a cross-headed standard and holding a ship&#x27;s stern in her left hand while crowned by the Roman goddess of victory, Victoria.

=====At Byblos=====

The temple of ʿAštart at Afqa, in the territory of the city-state of Byblos, was one of the most renowned sanctuaries in ancient Phoenicia, located at the source of the Adonis river, where, according to Melitōn of Sardis, was the tomb of Adonis, whose blood turned the river&#x27;s water red when he died there; according to Pseudo-Melito, this was the location of the tomb of Tammuz; and this temple was believed in ancient times to have been built by the legendary Cypriot king Kinuras, and it contained a waterpool, as well as pipelines which were used for lustrations linked to the cultic practises, and sacred prostitution, which was a typical part of the cult of ʿAštart, was also performed there.

ʿAštart of Afqa, who possessed erotic traits, was a goddess of the planet Venus as the Evening Star which brought together the sexes. This goddess later identified in Graeco-Roman times with the Greek goddess Aphrodite Urania ().

By the Hellenistic period, the goddess (, ) had become explicitly assimilated to ʿAštart, and therefore to the Greek (), with whom ʿAštart was herself equated, at Byblos, as well as at Afqa.

According to Zosimus, a phenomenon would take place at site of the temple of Afqa whereby a bright and fiery star-like object would be shot up from the top of a Lebanese mountain and would fall into the Adonis river. Pilgrims would gather at the temple on days of this occurrence, and would throw precious objects, such as gold- and silverworks or linen or sea silk into the waterpool of the temple as offerings: the offerings which sunk into the water were believed to have been accepted by ʿAštart while the ones which floated were considered to have been rejected by the goddess.

The Roman emperor Constantine I ordered the destruction of the temple of Afqa, although Zosimus and Sozomen in the 5th century AD recorded that pilgrims still gathered at the site of the temple to make offerings on the days when the luminous phenomenon would occur. The temple building itself was permanently destroyed in an earthquake during the 6th century AD, although it remained a popular sacred site connected to fertility until recent times.

======Tanit and ʿAštart======
Although the goddess (), whose first attestation was from the city of Sarepta, has been argued to have been a hypostasis of ʿAštart in older scholarship, the two goddesses to have been nevertheless possibly distinguished from each other in inscriptions. However, the evidence for so is still ambiguous and the name might itself have been a title which was attributed to multiple deities, including to ʿAštart. One inscription from Sarepta recording the dedication of a statue to () nevertheless suggests some form of identification between Tanit and ʿAštart.

=====At Acre=====
ʿAštart held high importance in the religious structure of the city-state of Acre, where she was identified with the Greek goddess Aphrodite in Graeco-Roman times, when she was the patron-goddess of the city&#x27;s public baths.

ʿAštart of Acre was depicted as Aphrodite on coins of the city from the 3rd century AD, where she was represented with a caduceus to her right, and the Greek god Eros, the son of Aphrodite, riding a dolphin to her left.

The goddess was however most often depicted on the coins of Acre under the traits of the Greek goddess Tyche in the latter&#x27;s role as the patron goddess of a municipality, in which capacity she was represented as seated on a rock, wearing a crown made of crenellated towers, and placing one foot on the shoulder of a young swimmer who personnified the river Orontes, although the swimmer in the coins of Acre stood for the river-god Belus, that is the present-day Nahr al-Naʿāmayn, and he held a reed and leans over an amphora, with a crocodile beneath him.

Under the reign of the Roman Emperor Publius Licinius Valerianus, ʿAštart was depicted coins similarly to a Syrian goddess, with a calathus hat, and seated between two lions like ʿAttarʿatta, with her right hand in a blessing position and her left one holding a flower.

=====At Tyre=====
The goddess ʿAštart held high prestige in the city-state of Tyre, where she was a dynastic goddess, as attested by the names of the 10th to 9th century BC Tyrian kings (), (), and (); the king Hiram I allegedly built a new temple for ʿAštart and Melqart, and the later king Ithobaal II held the title of &quot;priest of ʿAštart&quot; before he ascended to the throne of Tyre.

At Tyre, ʿAštart was closely associated to the god Melqart and was his consort, a custom which was carried on by the colonists who set out from Tyre to establish themsselves throughout the Mediterranean sea.

At the site of Ḫirbat aṭ-Ṭayibā, to the south of Tyre, a stone &quot;throne of Astarte&quot; with an inscription (KAI 17) was dedicated to ʿAštart in a sacred site located in the middle of the fields of the one who offered the dedication.

In the Tyrian town of Ḥamon, ʿAštart formed a triad with the god Milk-ʿAštart and the Angel of Milk-ʿAštart, and the city&#x27;s sanctuary of Milk-ʿAštart contained a dedication to ʿAštart.

In the 7th century BC, the warrior goddess role of ʿAštart was invoked in the treaty between the Assyrian king Esarhaddon and the Tyrian king Baal I in a line reading (, ). This description of ʿAštart paralleled that of the Mesopotamian Ishtar, who was given the title of (, ).

The association between ʿAštart and Melqart at Tyre continued until the Roman period, and an inscription from the Severan dynasty mentions the goddess ʿAštart, under the name of the Greek goddess Leucothea, along with Melqart, under the name of Heracles.

====== Astronoë ======
ʿAštart was sometimes worshipped at Tyre under the name of (), which was a form of her name where the feminine suffix had been replaced by the adjectival suffix ().

According to the 6th century AD Neoplatonist scholarch Damascius, was the &quot;mother of the gods&quot;, and had fallen in love with a young hunter, Eshmun of Berytus, who castrated himself to escape her, but whom the goddess resurrected.

The name of Astronoë was given to a Tyrian port, and she was mentioned in a Tyrian inscription from the 1st century AD after &quot;Hercules&quot;, that is Melqart. The name Astronoë is also recorded from Rhodes in the eastern Mediterranean, and from Carthage in the western Mediterranean.

=====In Egypt=====
Due to the influence of the Egyptian Osiris myth, the Phoenicians who lived in Egypt during the Hellenistic period continued the identification of ʿAštart with Isis, in which capacity they worshipped this latter goddess.

=====In Cyprus=====
The worship of ʿAštart is widely attested in ancient Cyprus, where she had been assimilated to the Greek goddess Aphrodite from early times, due to which many early shrines of Aphrodite in Cyprus showed partial Phoenician influence.

The Cypriot ʿAštart was already depicted in Phoenician ivory sculptures and in the Book of Proverbs (7) of the Bible, and was likely referred by the Greeks as (, ) and by the Romans as the of Salamis.

======At Kition======
A shrine of ʿAštart stood at the Bamboula site in ancient Kition, which has yielded a 4th-century BC alabaster tablet on which were recorded the expenses of the shrine over the course of a whole month as well as a mention of ʿAštart by her common title of (, ).

The inhabitants of the Kition identified ʿAštart with the Greek goddess Aphrodite Urania.

Under the rule of the kingdom of Kition, a big Phoenician archive was installed in Idalion; most of the archive is economic, but some of it is religious, and one of the ostraca records ʿAštart and Melqart in a .

======At Paphos======
In Cyprus, ʿAštart was identified during the 3rd century BC with the Greek goddess (, ), who was worshipped at Paphos, as recorded by a dedicatory inscription to (, ).

======At Amathous======

The goddess ʿAštart was the main deity of the city of Amathous, where stood one of the most famous temples of hers at the top of the acropolis of the city. The temple of ʿAštart of Amathous was erected in the 8th century BC, when the city was under Tyrian influence, with the presence of two Phoenician graffiti and Phoenician-type anthropoid sarcophagi at Amathous and Kition attesting of the existence of a Phoenician community living in these cities. The shrine of Amathous, like most Cypriot shrines of ʿAštart, thus exhibited partial Phoenician influences, such as worship halls, courtyards, and altars within a , and it was only in the 1st century AD that it was replaced by a Greek-style temple. During the 6th and 5th centuries BC, local hand-made votive figurines were associated to Phoenician-type small moulded plates depicting ʿAštart as a naked standing goddess holding her breasts, as well as to small Greek-type .

Two dedications offered by Androcles, the last king of Amathous, some time between 330 and 310 BC, respectively to the goddesses (, ) and (, ), as well as two monumental limestone vases have been found at the site of the shrine of Amathous.

Although Graeco-Roman authors had claimed that it was forbidden to spill blood in the temple of Amathous, remains of Hellenistic sacrifices provided evidence that goats and sheep were the main animals offered in sacrifice at the shrine ʿAštart.

According to the Roman authors Ovid, Pausanias, and Tacitus, the inhabitants of Cyprus considered the shrine of Venus, that is, ʿAštart) at Amathous as one of the three most reverend sites on Cyprus, along with Paphos and Salamis.

=====In the Aegean Sea and Greece=====
The name of the goddess ʿAštart was used as a theophoric element in several personal names, attested at Athens, Aphrodisias, Delos, and Rhodes, in their Hellenised forms and including the element (, from ).

======In Rhodes======
At Rhodes (in KAI 44, one of the Rhodes Phoenician-Greek bilingual inscriptions), the full title of one of the temple attendants who participated of the cult of Melqart, the , bore the title of (, possibly meaning &quot;ʿAštartean husband&quot;).

======At Delos======
A Sidonian woman is recorded as having honoured ʿAštart, assimilated to the Egyptian Isis, in the official Serapeum of Delos.

======At Kos======
At Kos, a Phoenician thiasote took ʿAštart and Zeus Soter (that is, Baal Mahalāk, ) as his patron deities, and a son of the Sidonian king Abdalonymus dedicated a piece of maritime art to the goddess ʿAštart-Aphrodite for the life of the sailors (KAI 292).

=====In Malta=====

In the late 8th century BC, Phoenicians repurposed an old Copper Age megalithic structure at Tas-Silġ on the island of Malta into a temple of ʿAštart where offerings were given to her by readjusting its walls, placing their altar on an older altar stone, building several shrines, and placing there large numbers of votive gifts, especially Hellenistic-style statues.

The sanctuary of ʿAštart at Tas-Silg was of large dimensions, being 100 metres wide, and was renowned in antiquity for its great wealth. The Tas-Silġ temple has yielded many Punic inscriptions dating from the 5th to 1st centuries BC containing short dedications to ʿAštart, who was there identified with the Greek supreme goddess () and later with the Italic Juno, due to which Cicero later referred to it as the , &quot;the temple of Juno&quot;.

A temple of ʿAštart also existed on the island of Gozo.

=====In Sicily=====

ʿAštart worshipped in Sicily at the Mount Eryx, where stood a temple a goddess, on a rocky outcrop which domonates from its north-east the city of Eryx, which itself was a town which had once belonged to the Elymians and was an ally of the Phoenicians settled at Ṣiṣ and Moṭwē before becoming a Punic fort during the 4th to 3rd century BC. The temple of Mount Eryx was initially dedicated to an indigenous goddess named in Oscan inscriptions as (), who was later identified with ʿAštart, and later to the Greek Aphrodite and the Roman Venus Erycina.

The Romans themselves called the temple of Mount Eryx the &quot;&quot;, , and according to a Roman coin from the 1st century BC, it had four columns, the mountain itself was surrounded by a wall, so that the shrine could only reached by passing through a monumental gate. Claudius Aelianus recounted a legend, according to which the &quot;Veneris fānum&quot; possessed an open-air altar from which all the sacrifices offered to the goddess during the day would disappear during the night and would be replaced with dew and fresh herbs, which was similar to some characteristics of the cult of the Cypriot ʿAštart.

Older coins depicted the goddess of Eryx with a dove, which was an attribute of the Levantine ʿAštart, as well as with the Greek Erōs, the son of Aphrodite, and a dog, which was commonly found within Phoenician religion and thus showed the presence of West Asian influences on her. Later coins represent her wearing a laurel wreath and a diadem.

Another typically Levantine aspect of the cult of the ʿAštart of Eryx was the practise of sacred prostitution, which was carried out by the &quot;servants&quot; of the goddess. Sacred prostitution at the &quot;Veneris fānum&quot; was well known enough in antiquity that Titus Maccius Plautus recorded an old man&#x27;s advice to a pimp in which he mentioned that courtesans at the shrine would earn large amounts of money.

The worship of this goddess later spread to the Graeco-Roman world, where her worship is attested at Rome, Herculaneum, Dikaiarkhia, Potentia, and Greece. In the Punic world, she was worshipped at Karalis, in Sardinia, at Carthage, where two inscriptions refer to the ʿAštart of Eryx, as well as at Thibilis, Cirta, Madaure, and Sicca Veneria, which was well known in ancient times for its practise of sacred prostitution, which was performed there by the &quot; ().

=====In Carthage=====
In Carthage and in Phoenico-Punic Africa in general, the goddess Tanit appears to have displaced ʿAštart and taken over her roles, due to which she became called (, ), who was often paired with the supreme Carthaginian god Baal Hammon.

Although the goddess ʿAštart held lesser importance in North Africa, she was worshipped at Carthage, where her cult was imported directly from Phoenicia, especially from Tyre and Ṣidōn, as well as from Eryx.

A 7th century BC golden medallion from Carthage mentioned the goddess ʿAštart alongside an individual named Pygmalion to whom the medallion belonged.

During the Punic period, ʿAštart was connected to the worship of Eshmun, as she was in the Sidonian temple at Bustān aš-Šayḫ, and she was herself worshipped under the name of (, ). ʿAštart, like Tanit, possessed a temple of her own in the city of Carthage, which was located in the city&#x27;s centre. It was likely the warrior form of the goddess who was worshipped in this temple, since her weapons and chariot were kept there.

The Punic general Hannibal invoked ʿAštart, referring to her in Greek as Hera, as one of the many deities he took as witness in the treaty he concluded with the king Philip V of Macedon.

During the 3rd to 2nd centuries BC, a temple to the Egyptian goddess Isis, identified to ʿAštart, existed at Carthage.

Following the destruction of Carthage and its annexation by the Roman Republic at the end of the Punic Wars, the Romans continued the worship of ʿAštart under the name of , ), and when they rebuilt Carthage in 123 BC, they initially named it Junonia after Juno Caelestis, that is, after ʿAštart. The Romans also rebuilt the temple of ʿAštart and dedicated it to Juno Caelestis, who was thus a Roman continuation of the initial Punic cult of ʿAštart, and a distinct goddess from the native Roman Juno Regina. During the Roman period, ʿAštart was still worshipped under her Phoenician name at Thuburbo Maius, where she was identified with Juno Caelestis.

The identification of ʿAštart with the Egyptian Isis continued in the formerly Punic territories of North Africa after the Roman conquest, and several  existed in the region under Roman rule.

Roman writers mentioned that Africans worshipped &quot;, , who arrived from the East and whose favourite place to stay was Carthage; Tertullian in the 2nd century AD noted the parallels between the African Caelestis and the Levantine ʿAštart; Herodian in the 2nd to 3rd century AD mentioned a goddess (, ), who was worshipped by the Carthaginians and the Libyans, and whose name he recorded as (, ), which was both a deformation and reinterpretation of the name of ʿAštart; and Aurelius Augustinus Hipponensis recorded that Punic people called Juno &quot;Astarte&quot;, that is ʿAštart.

The worship of ʿAštart-Caelestis held an exceptional importance at Mididi, where she was called by her Phoenician-Punic name, and was called the &quot;wife of Baal&quot;, as recorded in a neo-Punic inscription reading (, ) Attesting of her primacy at Mididi was a stela discovered there, with the goddess being depicted on its pediment, while on its lower level was the African Saturn (that is, Baal Hammon), to whose right was the goddess Kubeleya seated on her lion, who was herself identified at Mididi with ʿAštart, and not with Tanit.

The Roman temple of Juno Caelestis, according to the 5th century AD Bishop of Carthage, Quodvultdeus, was of large proportions, and was surrounded by shrines to various deities associated to the goddess, and the 5th century AD Bishop of Byzacena Victor Vitensis described it as being located near the Baths of Antoninus; the temple had already been desecrated under the reign of the Roman emperor Flavius Theodosius, and it was finally destroyed in 421 AD following unrest by the pagan population of the city.

=====In Italy=====

The Etruscans identified ʿAštart with their own goddess (), as attested by the gold tablets discovered in 1964 at the site of renowned sanctuary built in the 6th century BC to the goddess Uni in the town of Pyrgi, the port of the Etruscan city-state of Cisra. Uni was associated to the god Tinia, who was the Etruscan equivalent of the Greek Zeus and was assimilated to Melqart, with the divine couple of Uni and Tinia being thus assimilated to the Phoenician-Punic divine couple of ʿAštart and Melqart.

The gold tablets from the Pyrgi renowned were engraved with Etruscan and Phoenician-Punic inscriptions recording the dedication of a cult centre to ʿAštart by the king Tiberius Velianas of Cisra, who ruled around , on &quot;the day of the burial of the god (Melqart).&quot; The practise of this cult to the Phoenician-Punic by an Etruscan king might have been the result of a possible treaty with Carthage, and the rites practised at the shrine of Pyrgi included sacred prostitution, performed by the &quot;&quot;, the prostitutes of Pyrgi.

The shrine of Pyrgi was a wealthy one, as evidenced by the 1500 talents which Dionysios I of Syracuse looted from it in 384 BC.

=====In Hispania=====
As attested by the Seville/El Carambolo Statuette, imported from the Levant to Hispania, the Phoenician activities in the Mediterranean had spread the cult of ʿAštart till Hispania.

The worship of ʿAštart also continued in Hispania after it was conquered by the Romans, with the goddess being there also called Juno, and the existence of a temple and an altar to &quot;Juno,&quot; that is to ʿAštart, is mentioned by Artemidōros and Pomponius Mela. One Latin inscription from the Roman imperial period refers to a priest named Herculis whose father was named Junonis, reflecting the Punic association of &quot;Hercules&quot; (Melqart) and &quot;Juno&quot; (ʿAštart).

The &quot;Islands of Hera,&quot; or &quot;Islands of Juno,&quot; located in the Strait of Gibraltar, as well as the island of Junonia in the Atlantic Ocean and the &quot;Cape of Hera&quot; or &quot;Cape of Juna&quot; (presently Cape Trafalgar), also owed their names to ʿAštart.

=====In Britannia=====
Under the Roman Empire, the cult of ʿAštart had spread till the foot of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall in Britannia, where she was invoked using her Phoenician name and associated to the &quot;Tyrian Hercules,&quot; that is to Melqart, thus being a continuation of the close connection between Melqart and ʿAštart, and attesting of the Phoenician origin of this cult.

====Rituals====
A typically Levantine aspect of the cult of ʿAštart was the practise of sacred prostitution, which was performed by specific categories of her temples&#x27; clergy who were exercised this function on a permanent basis. The different categories of sacred prostitutes were the:
* (, ), who were sometimes simply called (, );
* (, ), who were male sacred prostitutes who engaged in homosexual intercourse;
* (, or ), who were later called (, ).

The practise of sacred prostitution is attested at the temple of ʿAštart in Byblos, and sacred prostitutes and &quot;whelps&quot; are recorded at the temples of ʿAštart at Afqa and Baalbek until the 4th century AD. The practise is also recorded in Cyprus, especially at Paphos, Amathous, and Kition, and in Sicily, at Eryx, from where two sacred prostitutes of Carthaginian origin are known by name: (, ) and her daughter

Sacred prostitution in the honour of ʿAštart was also practised at Carthage, as well as at Sicca Veneria, which was renowned for its sacred prostitution rituals, and sacred prostitution might have also been performed at some brothels.

The Phoenician imagery of &quot;the woman at the window&quot;, as well as the &quot;Peeper&quot; of Cyprus, the Venus prōspiciēns of Salamis, as well as the El Carambolo statuette depicting a naked ʿAštart and some specific feminine images were semantically connected to sacred prostitution performed in the honour of ʿAštart.

=====Legacy=====
Other ancient Mediterranean peoples considered ʿAštart to be the supreme goddess of the Phoenicians, due to which several of them identified her with their own supreme goddess, with the Greeks identifying her with Hera, the Etruscans with Uni, and the Romans with (Juno.

The Graeco-Romans Hellenised the name of ʿAštart as (), which they in turn Latinized as &quot;&quot;, and identified her with their own goddesses Aphrodite and Venus, due to her erotic aspect.

In the writings of the 1st century AD Roman poet Virgil, the goddess Venus mentioned the Cypriot shrine of ʿAštart at Amathous among her most famous temples.

The name ʿAštart&#x27;s variant of &quot;ʿAštārōniy&quot; was Hellenised as () under the influence of the Greek term (, .

====In Palestine====
The goddess () appears to have disappeared from most of inland Palestine during the Iron Age due to the ruling classes of the states in the region no longer identifying with the practise of hunting, so that her cult became restricted to the coastal areas such as in Philistia, where it enjoyed high prestige until the Graeco-Roman period.

One ceramic box from the 9th century discovered at the site of Tel Rehov was topped with a leonine figure, suggesting it was the emblematic animal of ʿAṯtart/ʿAštart, with an open mouth and dangling tongue lying in a prone position with its front limbs outstretched and of its paws placed, claws extended, each over a human head. Below the animal is a large opening which either was modelled on the entrance of a shrine or was intended to be a receptacle for a divine image: the leonine animal, who was depicted as imposing its power against the human figures, might have guarded the shrine against human intrusion, and might thus have represented the passage recorded earlier in Ugaritic texts as (, ).

=====In Israel and Judah=====
Following the trend of the disappearance of the worship of ʿAštart in inland Palestine, the state-level cult of this goddess was absent from Israelite and Judahite records from an early date, and she seems to have become one of many former gods demoted to the status of entities and powers of blessing under the control of the Israelite national god Yahweh. As such the plural form of ʿAštart&#x27;s name, (), became used as a term for goddesses and for fertility, while her role as a deity of warfare was absorbed by Yahweh.

The worship of ʿAštart might nevertheless have survived as a minor and popular, but not royal, cult among the Israelite population, with the practice of hunting for undomesticated animals to be sacrificed being restricted to the family and local shrines, but not at the state level. The influence of the Neo-Assyrian Ishtar later increased the influence of this cult within the Israelite religion, so that the Ishtar-influenced Israelite ʿAštart might have been the same goddess referred to as the Queen of Heaven (, ) by the Judahite prophet Jeremiah.

The Bible claims that the Israelite king Solomon introduced the worship of the Phoenician ʿAštart, called () in Masoretic text vocalization, in his kingdom, although it is uncertain whether this claim rests on any historical basis or if it was made retroactively as a reaction against Phoenician religious imports. The cult of the Phoenician ʿAštart appears to have nevertheless enjoyed some level of royal support during the later periods of the Israelite kingdom.

=====In Transjordan=====
Although an Ammonite seal dedicated to (, ) was found in Sidon, she appears to have been absent from Ammon itself.

Like in Israel and Ammon, there is no evidence of any cult of ʿAštart in Moab or Edom.

=====In Philistia=====
The Hebrew Bible records that the Philistines displayed the armour of the dead Israelite king Saul in their temple of &quot;Ashteroth&quot;, due to her role as a goddess of war and as the consort of Baal.

The inhabitants of the Philistine city-state of Ascalon worshipped ʿAštart and identified her with the Greek goddess Aphrodite Urania.

=== Later interpretations of biblical Astaroth ===
In some kabbalistic texts and in medieval and renaissance occultism (ex. &quot;The Book of Abramelin&quot;), the name was assigned to a male demon bearing little resemblance to the figure known from antiquity. For the use of the Hebrew plural form in this sense, see Astaroth.

== Myths ==

===At Ugarit===
In the Baʿal Epic of Ugarit, ʿAṯtartu is one of the allies of the eponymous hero. With the help of Anat she stops him from attacking the messengers who deliver the demands of Yam and later assists him in the battle against the sea god, possibly &quot;exhorting him to complete the task&quot; during it. It&#x27;s a matter of academic debate if they were also viewed as consorts. Their close relation is highlighted by the epithet &quot;face of Baal&quot; or &quot;of the name of Baal.&quot;

A different narrative, so-called &quot;Myth of Astarte the huntress&quot; casts ʿAṯtartu herself as the protagonist, and seemingly deals both with her role as a goddess of the hunt stalking game in the steppe, and with her possible relationship with Baal.

====ʿAṯtartu and Anat====
Fragmentary narratives describe ʿAṯtartu and Anat hunting together. They were frequently treated as a pair in cult. For example, an incantation against snakebite invokes them together in a list of gods who asked for help. Texts from Emar, which are mostly of ritual nature unlike narrative ones known from Ugarit, indicate that ʿAṯtartu was a prominent deity in that city as well, and unlike in Ugarit, she additionally played a much bigger role in cult followings than Anat.

====Misconceptions in scholarship====
While the association between ʿAṯtartu and Anat is well attested, primary sources from Ugarit and elsewhere provide no evidence in support of the misconception that Athirat (Asherah) and ʿAṯtartu were ever conflated, let alone that Athirat was ever viewed as Baal&#x27;s consort like ʿAṯtartu possibly was. Scholar of Ugaritic mythology and the Bible Steve A. Wiggins in his monograph &quot;A Reassessment of Asherah: With Further Considerations of the Goddess&quot; notes that such arguments rest on scarce biblical evidence (which indicates at best a confusion between obscure terms in the Book of Judges rather than between unrelated deities in Canaanite or Bronze Age Ugaritic religion) sums up the issue with such claims: &quot;(...) Athtart begins with an ayin, and Athirat with an aleph. (...) Athtart appears in parallel with Anat in texts (...), but Athirat and Athtart do not occur in parallel.&quot; God lists from Ugarit indicate that ʿAṯtartu was viewed as analogous to Mesopotamian Ishtar and Hurrian Ishara, but not Athirat.

==Other associations==
Hittitologist Gary Beckman pointed out the similarity between Astarte&#x27;s role as a goddess associated with horses and chariots to that played in Hittite religion by another &quot;Ishtar type&quot; goddess, Pinikir, introduced to Anatolia from Elam by Hurrians.

Allat and Astarte may have been conflated in Palmyra. On one of the tesserae used by the Bel Yedi&#x27;ebel for a religious banquet at the temple of Bel, the deity Allat was given the name Astarte (&#x27;štrt). The assimilation of Allat to Astarte is not surprising in a milieu as much exposed to Aramaean and Phoenician influences as the one in which the Palmyrene theologians lived.

Plutarch, in his &quot;On Isis and Osiris&quot;, indicates that the King and Queen of Byblos, who, unknowingly, have the body of Osiris in a pillar in their hall, are &quot;Melcarthus&quot; (i.e. Melqart) and Astarte (though he notes some instead call the Queen &quot;Saosis&quot; or &quot;Nemanūs&quot;, which Plutarch interprets as corresponding to the Greek name &quot;Athenais&quot;).

Lucian of Samosata asserted that, in the territory of Ṣidōn, the temple of Astarte was sacred to Europa. In Greek mythology Europa was a Phoenician princess whom Zeus, having transformed himself into a white bull, abducted, and carried to Crete.

Byron used the name Astarte in his poem &quot;Manfred&quot;.

==In popular culture==
* In &quot;Zadig; or, The Book of Fate&quot; (; 1747), a novella and work of philosophical fiction by the Enlightenment writer Voltaire, Astarté is a woman, a queen of Babylon reduced to slavery, who finds her first and only love: Zadig.
* The name Astarte was given to a massive post-starburst galaxy during the cosmic noon (the peak of the star formation rate density).
* German author Jason Dark featured Astarte in his long-running novel series &quot;John Sinclair&quot;, in which she is said to be identical with Asherah and Anat. She is depicted as a villain and the historical consort of Baal.
* Astarte appears as a playable Avenger-class Servant in &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot; (2015), with her name stylized as &quot;Ashtart&quot;. However, she first introduces herself as &quot;Space Ishtar&quot;, and only reveals her true name after her third Ascension.
* There is an Idol House of Astarte in the Agatha Christie story &quot;The Idol House of Astarte&quot;.
* In the &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; setting, the High Gothic (stand-in used in place of Latin) name of the Imperial Space Marines is the Adeptus Astartes, named for one of their creators, Amar Astarte, an immortal human.

<text>A chain gun is a type of autocannon or machine gun that uses an external source of power to cycle the weapon&#x27;s action via a continuous loop of chain, similar to that used on a motorcycle or bicycle, instead of diverting excess energy from the cartridges&#x27; propellant as in a typical automatic firearm.

==History==
In 1972, Hughes Helicopters began a company-funded research effort to design a single machine gun to fire the U.S. Army&#x27;s M50 round. In April 1973, the program fired test rounds in more powerful WECOM linked ammunition, from a prototype A model. In January 1975, a model &quot;C&quot; was added, a linkless version for the proposed Advanced Attack Helicopter YAH-64. The helicopter was later adopted as the Hughes Model 77/AH-64A Apache, with the model C receiving the designation M230 chain gun as its standard armament. 

In 1976, Hughes Helicopters patented the chain gun, and it has since been further developed into several other systems of different calibers.

, &quot;chain gun&quot; is a registered trademark of Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems, formerly Orbital ATK, following several mergers and acquisitions after Hughes Helicopters, for &quot;externally-powered machine guns&quot;.

==Design==
There are several differences between chain guns and other types of autocannon. While rotary guns can also use an external source of power to cycle the weapon&#x27;s mechanism, they have multiple rotating barrels, unlike chain guns. The necessary actions are performed by complex rotating cam mechanisms, not a chain. 

Recoil-operated guns, e.g. many machine guns, the Bofors gun, and gas-operated guns, e.g. most assault rifles, the ShVAK cannon, depend upon the firing of the cartridges of the weapon&#x27;s ammunition to power the cycle of action, instead of an external power source. As a cartridge may misfire - completely fail to fire, hang fire - or discharge with insufficient force to cycle the mechanism, this fundamental dependence affects the reliability of such weapons.

In contrast, in a chain gun the action of the firearm is cycled by a roller chain, driven by an electric motor. The chain moves in a rectangular circuit around four sprockets that apply tension to it. One link of the chain is connected to the bolt assembly, moving it back and forth to load, fire, extract, and eject cartridges. 

Each full cycle consists of four different periods of the key link travelling along the circuit. Two periods, the passage along the &quot;long&quot; sides of the rectangle, control the movement of the bolt: the time that the bolt takes to drive forward and load a round into the chamber, and how quickly the bolt retracts and extracts the spent cartridge after firing. The other two periods, when the chain moves across the &quot;short&quot; sides of the rectangle, sideways relative to the axis of the barrel, determine how long the breech remains locked while firing, and open to allow cartridge extraction and ventilation of fumes.

A misfired round does not stop the functioning of the weapon, as it might with guns that use energy from a fired cartridge to load the next round. It is simply ejected. Thus, the chain gun operating principle is inherently reliable. An unclassified report on the EX-34 prepared by the Naval Surface Weapons Center in Dahlgren, Virginia, dated September 23, 1983, said that:29,721 rounds of endurance tests were fired with no parts breakage and without any gun stoppages ... It is significant that during firing of 101,343 rounds not one jam or stoppage occurred due to loss of round control in the gun or feeder mechanism ... [this] is in our experience very unusual in any weapon of any caliber or type.

The time that the chain takes to move around a complete loop of the rectangle controls the rate of fire. Accordingly, varying the motor-speed allows a chain gun, in principle, to fire at a continuously variable rate from single rounds to the maximum safe rate. The maximum rate depends on the pressure drop rates in the barrel after firing a cartridge, on mechanical tolerances, and other factors. For example, the 7.62mm NATO version EX-34 was advertised to fire 570 rounds per minute, and developmental work was underway for a 1,000-rounds-per-minute version. In practice, chain guns usually have two or three set firing speeds.

<text>Xinyi District or Sinyi District is considered the financial district of Taipei, Taiwan. The district is also one of the shopping areas in Taipei, anchored by a number of department stores and malls.

Xinyi District includes Taipei 101, Taipei International Convention Center, Taipei World Trade Center, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall and various shopping malls and entertainment venues.

== History and geography ==
During Japanese rule (1895–1945), covered modern day Xinyi and Songshan districts. The village was named after Matsuyama City in Japan and formed part of Shichisei District, Taihoku Prefecture. Matsuyama Village was incorporated into Taihoku City (modern-day Taipei) in 1938. It was renamed Songshan District in 1945.

In 1990, Songshan District was split in two as part of a citywide reorganization. The southern half became Xinyi District while the northern half retained its name. The present border of Xinyi runs along Civic Boulevard. Xinyi is separated from the Nangang District on the east by Fude St.; from Wenshan District in the south by Baozijiang and Poneikeng () Mountains; and from Daan District in the west by the Zhuangjing Tunnel (), Keelung Road and Guangfu Road. Development of the area in the 1990s transformed Xinyi into a modern shopping district which by 2010 boasted the highest property values in Taiwan.

<text>The Salt Lake Assembly Hall is a building owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) which sits on the southwest corner of Temple Square in Salt Lake City, Utah. It has seating capacity for an audience of approximately 1,400 people.

==Design==
The Assembly Hall is a Victorian Gothic congregation hall. Rough granite walls are laid out in cruciform style making the hall&#x27;s exterior look like a small gothic cathedral. Twenty-four spires mark the perimeter of the building&#x27;s footprint and a tower rises from the intersection of the floor plan&#x27;s apparent crucifix. The cruciform layout is complemented by Stars of David circumscribed high above each entrance. These symbolize an LDS perception that they are a re-gathering of Biblical Tribes of Israel.

However, the deceptively Gothic exterior conceals a more modern interior lacking vaulted ceilings.

Although built of quartz monzonite rock from the same quarry as the Salt Lake Temple, the Assembly Hall&#x27;s unhewn exterior looks much different. The stones for the Assembly Hall were not cut as exactingly as the temple&#x27;s. This accounts for the building&#x27;s dark, rough texture and the broader masonry joints between stones.

The Seagull Monument sits directly in front of the building to the east.

==History==
Construction of the Assembly Hall began on August 11, 1877. Building began on the southwest corner of Temple Square on the site of what was called the &quot;Old Tabernacle,&quot; razed earlier that year. The old structure, an adobe building determined by the LDS Church to be inadequate, was built in 1852 and seated 2500. The &quot;Old Tabernacle&quot; is not to be confused with the still-extant Salt Lake Tabernacle, built in 1867. The domed Tabernacle sits directly north of the Assembly Hall.

During the first two years of construction, the Assembly Hall was confusingly called the &quot;new tabernacle.&quot; John Taylor, then president of the church, cleared up the confusion by naming it the &quot;Salt Lake Assembly Hall&quot; in 1879.

Obed Taylor was commissioned as architect, and designed the structure in Victorian Gothic style, which was popular at the time. Using mostly discarded granite stone from the ongoing construction of the Salt Lake Temple, builder Henry Grow completed construction in 1882 at a total cost of $90,000.

After the Tabernacle, the Assembly Hall was the second permanent structure completed on Temple Square. It has been modified several times since completion, however. A four-foot flying-angel weather vane like one that topped the original Nauvoo Temple in Nauvoo, Illinois was removed. Additionally, the original ceiling murals depicting ancient and modern prophets in the LDS Church were painted over.

The most comprehensive renovations occurred from 1979 to 1983 to correct structural weaknesses in the building&#x27;s tower and roof trusses. While rebuilding the tower, each of the Assembly Hall&#x27;s 24 spires were replaced with fiberglass moldings. Additionally, all the softwood benches were refinished. Acoustics in the building were enhanced by installing hundreds of small speakers.

Currently, the Assembly Hall hosts occasional free weekend music concerts and is used as overflow for the church&#x27;s biannual general conferences.

==Organs==
During the renovations of the 1970-80s, Robert L. Sipe Organbuilders installed a new three-manual, 65-rank, 3,489 pipe organ with a &quot;German accent.&quot; The renovations also included creation of rehearsal studios in the building&#x27;s basement containing three additional organs and a one-manual harpsichord built in 1981 by William Dowd. The southwest practice studio features a three-manual, 12-rank, 727 pipe organ built by the Austin Organ Company of Hartford, Connecticut. The console was built in 1963, while the chests and pipework were redone in 1982 The southeast studio organ was built by the Kenneth Coulter Organ Company of Eugene, Oregon in 1985, the Bach tricentennial year. It was specifically designed to imitate features of German Late Baroque organs and features three manuals, 7 ranks, and 410 pipes. The northeast practice studio organ was built in 1979 by the Casavant Frères organ company of Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec It is a mechanical action instrument and features interchangeable pedalboards, allowing for the use of either a modern concave design or the older flat European style. It has two manuals, seven ranks, and 452 pipes.
