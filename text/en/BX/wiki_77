<text>Dare to Be Stupid is the third studio album by the American parody musician &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, released on June 18, 1985. The album was one of many Yankovic records produced by former McCoys guitarist Rick Derringer. Recorded between August 1984 and March 1985, the album was Yankovic&#x27;s first studio album released following the success of 1984&#x27;s &quot;In 3-D&quot;, which included the Top 40 single &quot;Eat It&quot;.

The music on &quot;Dare to Be Stupid&quot; is built around parodies and pastiches of pop and rock music of the mid-1980s, featuring reimaginings of Madonna, Cyndi Lauper, Huey Lewis and the News, and the Kinks. The album also features many &quot;style parodies&quot;, or musical imitations that come close to, but do not copy, existing artists. These style parodies include imitations of Devo and Elvis Presley, as well as imitations of various musical genres such as doo-wop, sci-fi soundtracks, and music from the 1920s and 1930s.

Despite a mixed critical reception, &quot;Dare to Be Stupid&quot; sold well and peaked at number fifty on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album produced one of Yankovic&#x27;s more famous singles, &quot;Like a Surgeon&quot;, a parody of Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;; the single peaked at number 47 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album was Yankovic&#x27;s second Gold record and became certified Platinum for sales of over one million copies in the United States. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Recording in 1986.

==Production==
===Recording===
In January 1985 Yankovic began the recording sessions for his &quot;In 3-D&quot; follow-up album. Rick Derringer, former guitarist for the McCoys, returned as producer. Backing Yankovic were Jon &quot;Bermuda&quot; Schwartz on drums, Steve Jay on bass, and Jim West on guitar. The first session yielded four originals: &quot;Dare to Be Stupid&quot;, &quot;Cable TV&quot;, &quot;Slime Creatures from Outer Space&quot;, and &quot;One More Minute&quot;. The band also recorded a cover of the theme from &quot;George of the Jungle&quot;. The following month, Yankovic began recording the album&#x27;s four parodies and polka medley: &quot;Yoda&quot;, &quot;Like a Surgeon&quot;, &quot;I Want a New Duck&quot;, &quot;Girls Just Want to Have Lunch&quot;, and &quot;Hooked on Polkas&quot;.

===Originals===
&quot;This Is the Life&quot;, originally commissioned for the gangster spoof movie &quot;Johnny Dangerously&quot; and comically describing a gangster&#x27;s lavish lifestyle, had already been recorded and released as a single in November 1984. The album&#x27;s title track, &quot;Dare to Be Stupid&quot;, is an ode to living life stupidly. According to the liner notes of &quot;The Ultimate Video Collection&quot;, the song represents &quot;Al&#x27;s motto in life&quot;. The song is a style parody of the band Devo, whose reaction to the pastiche was positive. Yankovic said &quot;Right after I finished &#x27;Dare to Be Stupid&#x27;, I went over to Mark Mothersbaugh&#x27;s house and played it for him. He seemed to enjoy it a lot.&quot; The song was later released on the soundtrack to the 1986 film &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot;, and Yankovic later mused that more people were introduced to the song by the movie than by his own album.

&quot;One More Minute&quot;, about an ex-girlfriend, was written in the style of an Elvis Presley doo-wop song. According to the liner notes of &quot;Permanent Record&quot;, Yankovic was preparing to write songs for &quot;Dare to Be Stupid&quot; when his then-girlfriend broke up with him. In order to mentally deal with the heartbreak, Yankovic decided to write a humorous song to express his anger, eventually writing &quot;One More Minute&quot;. Yankovic tears up her picture in the video. &quot;Slime Creatures from Outer Space&quot; features prominent usage of a theremin, courtesy of Steve Jay, in order to emulate the sound of &quot;cheesy 50s sci-fi soundtracks.&quot;

===Parodies and polka===

On February 21, 1985, Yankovic began recording the parodies for &quot;Dare to Be Stupid&quot;. The first parody recorded for the album was &quot;Yoda&quot;. &quot;Yoda&quot; was originally written by Yankovic during the initial run of the 1980 American film &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. After the success of the movie, Yankovic toyed with the idea of writing a song based on the break-out character, but was unable to find a suitable song to use as the base. Yankovic remembers, &quot;I was still in college at the time, and a friend of mine named Mike suggested that I do the song to the tune of &#x27;Lola&#x27;—which I couldn&#x27;t believe that I hadn&#x27;t thought of myself, since I was such a huge Kinks fan.&quot; Yankovic wrote and recorded a version of the song, using only an accordion, on a four-track cassette Portastudio. This version of &quot;Yoda&quot; was a hit on &quot;The Dr. Demento Show&quot;, and even managed to hit, and hold onto, number one on the Funny Five countdown for several weeks. This early demo was later released on the sixth volume of Dr. Demento&#x27;s &quot;Basement Tapes&quot;.

After the success of the demo version, Yankovic wanted to put the song on one of his albums. However, securing permission from George Lucas and the Kinks delayed the release of the song for about five years. Eventually, after Lucas gave Yankovic permission, the song&#x27;s publishers turned Al down. Several versions of why the parody was turned down exist. In a 1985 interview with &quot;Spin&quot;, Yankovic explained that, &quot;We approached Ray Davies [the song&#x27;s composer], we&#x27;ve been approaching him every year and a half, two years before each album comes out and he&#x27;s always been a little skeptical, a little afraid because &#x27;Lola&#x27; was a very personal song for him. Then just out of the blue he decided this time to let us do it.&quot; However, the liner notes to the &quot;Permanent Record&quot; present a different story. According to the album&#x27;s notes, the song may have remained unreleased for some time had it not been for a chance encounter between Yankovic and Davies. When Yankovic asked why he hadn&#x27;t given him permission, Davies remarked that he had never been asked. Davies immediately gave Yankovic permission to record the song, and the song was later released on &quot;Dare to Be Stupid&quot;.

The day after recording &quot;Yoda&quot;, Yankovic started recording &quot;Like a Surgeon&quot;, the lead single for the album. Although Yankovic normally refuses to use parody ideas from other people, Madonna is partly responsible for &quot;Like a Surgeon&quot;. Madonna asked one of her friends how long it would take until Yankovic satirized her song &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; into &quot;Like a Surgeon&quot;. This friend was a mutual friend of Al&#x27;s manager, Jay Levey. When word got back to Yankovic, he decided it was a good idea and wrote the song. This is the only known time that Yankovic has gotten a parody idea directly from the original artist.

The third parody recorded for the album was a parody of &quot;I Want a New Drug&quot; by Huey Lewis and the News entitled &quot;I Want a New Duck&quot;. After the recording of &quot;I Want a New Duck&quot;, Yankovic was comfortable with releasing the album as it was. However, Scotti Bros. insisted that Yankovic include a parody of a Cyndi Lauper song. Yankovic complied, producing &quot;Girls Just Want to Have Lunch&quot;. However, because he was effectively forced to record the parody, Yankovic has cited &quot;Girls Just Want to Have Lunch&quot; as one of his least favorite songs, and ultimately left it off his 1993 compilation album &quot;The Food Album&quot;. Yankovic also approached Prince about a potential parody of &quot;When Doves Cry&quot;, circa 1984. Prince refused, and did not accept any future parody ideas Yankovic presented to him.

On March 25, 1985, Yankovic rounded out the recording of his new album with a polka medley of then-popular songs in music. &quot;Dare to Be Stupid&quot; also includes &quot;George of the Jungle&quot;, a cover of the theme song to the 1967 TV series. It was the first of only a few cover songs, not counting polka medleys, released by Yankovic. The song later appeared on the soundtrack to the 1997 film adaptation of &quot;George of the Jungle&quot;.

==Reception==
===Promotion===
After the release of the album, Yankovic undertook the 70-city &quot;Stupid Tour&quot;; this was his biggest tour of the 1980s, and featured &quot;costume changes, carefully designed lighting, and several of Al&#x27;s videos cleverly integrated into the stage show&quot;. Yankovic&#x27;s on-stage wardrobe changed dramatically during the tour, and he specifically stipulated that every promoter &quot;had to supply one garish Hawaiian shirt&quot; for him to wear. Yankovic eventually acquired &quot;a couple closets full&quot; of them. Yankovic also started wearing exclusively Vans, and joked that &quot;whenever I need some they let me go to their warehouse and take home an armload.&quot;

The videos that were made to promote &quot;Dare to Be Stupid&quot; were later compiled, with additional material, into a direct-to-video mockumentary called &quot;The Compleat Al&quot;. This production, directed by Yankovic&#x27;s manager Jay Levey and Robert K. Weiss, was one of &quot;the first programs of its kind to be made specifically for the home video market&quot;. A 60-minute version was later aired on Showtime. To go along with the video, the tongue-in-cheek book &quot;The Authorized Al&quot; was also released. The book, co-written by Yankovic and Tino Insana, has since gone out of print.

===Critical response===

&quot;Dare to Be Stupid&quot; received moderately favorable reviews from critics. AllMusic reviewer Eugene Chadbourne awarded the album three and a half stars, and cited &quot;Like a Surgeon&quot; and &quot;Dare to Be Stupid&quot; as some of Yankovic&#x27;s best songs. Christopher Thelen from The Daily Vault wrote that &quot;while &quot;Dare To Be Stupid&quot; is not Yankovic&#x27;s finest album [...] there&#x27;s enough on this one to recommend it&quot;. The song &quot;Yoda&quot; has gone on to become one of Yankovic&#x27;s most famous songs. Although it was left off his first greatest hits album, the song was featured on the second volume, the box set &quot;Permanent Record&quot;, and the 2009 compilation &quot;The Essential &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&quot;. The song appeared on &quot;The Time Machine&quot; episode of &quot;The Weird Al Show&quot;, and on the compilation album &quot;Radio Disney: Kid Jams&quot;.

Although the lead single &quot;Like a Surgeon&quot; and the parody &quot;Yoda&quot; were met with praise, many criticized the album&#x27;s other parodies. Many critics were split on the amount of emphasis the original songs were given. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer David Hinkley wrote positively that &quot;the pick of this album&#x27;s original litter is &#x27;One More Minute&#x27;, which is a parody of a style (Fifties vocal group) rather than a specific song and is a superb tune besides – right down to the perfect little gasp right before the final chorus&quot;. In contrast, Chadbourne was disappointed with the original material, stating that &quot;only someone who is missing important brain cells would suggest this artist&#x27;s original songs are any good&quot;. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Recording in 1986, though it lost to Whoopi Goldberg&#x27;s &quot;Whoopi: Original Broadway Recording&quot;.

===Commercial performance===
&quot;Dare to Be Stupid&quot; was released on June 18, 1985; it was the first album of musical comedy to be released on compact disc. &quot;Dare to Be Stupid&quot; eventually peaked on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 50. The album spent a total of eight weeks on the chart. On January 27, 1986, a little less than a year after its release, the album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). On February 24, 2003, the album was certified Platinum by the RIAA.

<text>Abraham Bosse ( – 14 February 1676) was a French artist, mainly as a printmaker in etching, but also in watercolour.

==Life==
He was born to Huguenot (Calvinist) parents in Tours, France, where his father had moved from Germany. His father was a tailor, and Bosse&#x27;s work always depicted clothes in loving detail. He married Catherine Sarrabat at Tours in 1632. He remained a Huguenot, dying before the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, but was happy to illustrate religious subjects to Catholic taste.

==Work==
Roughly 1600 etchings are attributed to him, with subjects including: daily life, religion, literature, fashion, technology, and science. Most of his output was illustrations for books, but many were also sold separately.

His style grows from Dutch and Flemish art, but is given a strongly French flavour. Many of his images give informative detail about middle and upper-class daily life in the period, although they must be treated with care as historical evidence. His combination of very carefully depicted grand interiors with relatively trivial domestic subjects was original and highly influential on French art, and also abroad — William Hogarth&#x27;s engravings are, among other things, a parody of the style. Most of his images are perhaps best regarded as illustrations rather than art.

He was apprenticed in Paris about 1620 to the Antwerp-born engraver Melchior Tavernier, who was also an important publisher. His first etchings date to 1622, and are influenced by Jacques Bellange. Following a meeting in Paris about 1630, he became a follower of Jacques Callot, whose technical innovations in etching he popularised in the famous and much translated &quot;Traité des manières de graver en taille-douce&quot; [&quot;Treatise on Line Engraving&quot;] (1645), the first to be published. He took Callot&#x27;s highly detailed small images to a larger size, and a wider range of subject matter.

Unlike Callot, his declared aim, in which he largely succeeded, was to make etchings look like engravings, to which end he sacrificed willingly the freedom of the etched line, whilst certainly exploiting to the full the speed of the technique. Like most etchers, he frequently used engraving on a plate in addition to etching, but produced no pure engravings.

==Controversy==
In 1641, he began to attend classes given by the architect Girard Desargues (1591–1661) on perspective and other technical aspects of depiction. Bosse not only adopted these methods but also published a series of works between 1643–1653 explaining and promoting them.

In 1648, Cardinal Mazarin established the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture. Bosse was made an honorary member in 1651. However his publicising of Desargues&#x27; methods embroiled him in a controversy with Charles Le Brun and his followers, who had different methods, and also a belief that &quot;genius&quot; rather than technical method should be the guide in creating artworks. In 1661 Bosse was forced to withdraw from the Academy; he established his own school as an alternative, but it was suppressed by Le Brun.

<doc id="681837" wikidata="Q2545429" url="?curid=681837" title="&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic in 3-D">
<text>&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic in 3-D (often referred to simply as In 3-D) is the second studio album by the American parody musician &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, released on February 28, 1984, by Rock &#x27;n Roll Records. The album was one of many produced by former McCoys guitarist Rick Derringer. Recorded between October and December 1983, the album was Yankovic&#x27;s follow-up to his modestly successful debut LP, &quot;&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&quot;.

The album is built around parodies and pastiches of pop and rock music of the mid-1980s. Half of the album is made up of parodies of artists like Michael Jackson, Men Without Hats, the Greg Kihn Band, the Police, and Survivor. The other half of the album contains many &quot;style parodies&quot;, musical imitations that come close to but do not directly copy a specific work by existing artists. These style parodies include imitations of artists such as Bob Marley and the B-52s. This album marked a musical departure from Yankovic&#x27;s self-titled debut, in that the arrangements of the parodies were now closer to the originals. Also, the accordion was no longer used in every song, but only where deemed appropriate or comically inappropriate. The album is also notable for being the first album released by Yankovic to include a polka of hit songs. A similar pastiche of hit songs, set to polka music, has since appeared on nearly all of Yankovic&#x27;s albums.

&quot;&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic in 3-D&quot; was met with mostly positive reviews and peaked at number seventeen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number sixty-one in Australia. The album also produced one of Yankovic&#x27;s most famous singles, &quot;Eat It&quot; (a parody of Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Beat It&quot;), which peaked at number twelve on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. This song was Yankovic&#x27;s highest-charting single until &quot;White &amp; Nerdy&quot; from his 2006 album &quot;Straight Outta Lynwood&quot; peaked at number nine in the October 21, 2006 &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. &quot;Eat It&quot; also charted at number one in Australia, making it Yankovic&#x27;s only number one single in any country. The album also produced two minor US hits, &quot;King of Suede&quot;, which peaked at number sixty-two, and &quot;I Lost on Jeopardy&quot;, which peaked at number eighty-one. The album was Yankovic&#x27;s first Gold record, and went on to be certified Platinum for sales of over one million copies in the United States. &quot;Eat It&quot; won a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Performance Single or Album, Spoken or Musical in 1985.

==Production==
===Recording===
In October 1983, Yankovic began recording his second album at Santa Monica Sound Recorders, in Santa Monica, California. To produce it, he brought in former McCoys guitarist Rick Derringer, who also produced Yankovic&#x27;s first album. Backing Yankovic were Jon &quot;Bermuda&quot; Schwartz on drums, Steve Jay on bass, and Jim West on guitar. During the first recording session for the album, five original songs were recorded: &quot;Nature Trail to Hell&quot;, &quot;Mr. Popeil&quot;, &quot;Buy Me a Condo&quot;, &quot;Midnight Star&quot;, and &quot;That Boy Could Dance&quot;. Two months later, Yankovic began recording the five parodies and polka medley that would appear on the album: &quot;Eat It&quot;, &quot;King of Suede&quot;, &quot;I Lost on Jeopardy&quot;, &quot;Theme from Rocky XIII (The Rye or the Kaiser)&quot;, &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, and &quot;Polkas on 45&quot;.

Every song on Yankovic&#x27;s debut album was played on an accordion, accompanied by bass, guitar, and drums. On &quot;In 3-D&quot;, Yankovic decided to restrict the accordion to certain sections, most notably the polka medley &quot;Polkas on 45&quot;. In the &quot;Ask Al&quot; section of his web site, Yankovic explained: &quot;Nowadays, I only use it on original songs where I feel an accordion is appropriate, and on parody songs where I feel an accordion is [comically] inappropriate ... and of course, on the polka medleys. I&#x27;m not really downplaying the accordion at all – I usually feature the accordion on three or four songs every album, which is three or four more accordion-based songs than most Top 40 albums have!&quot;

===Originals===
One of the first originals recorded for the album was &quot;Midnight Star&quot;, a loving ode to fictional supermarket tabloids. The liner notes to &quot;Permanent Record&quot; state that a &quot;Weekly World News&quot; article about the &quot;Incredible Frog Boy&quot; helped to inspire the song. According to Yankovic, most of the tabloid headlines were real. He spent several weeks collecting and looking through old tabloids to find inane titles. Initially, he thought that &quot;Midnight Star&quot; should have been the lead single for the album, but later relented and released &quot;Eat It&quot; instead. &quot;Buy Me a Condo&quot; is a style parody of Bob Marley and the reggae genre in general.

&quot;Mr. Popeil&quot; is a song discussing the inventor Sam Popeil (the father of inventor Ron Popeil) and his myriad inventions of varying usefulness. Musically, it is a style parody of the B-52s, which Robert Christgau wrote &quot;exploits Yankovic&#x27;s otherwise fatal resemblance to Fred Schneider.&quot; One of the backing vocalists on the track is Ron Popeil&#x27;s sister, Lisa Popeil. When recording the song, Yankovic came across an article about Lisa Popeil and her singing career and later asked her if she would be interested in appearing in the song, to which she agreed.

The last original song to be recorded for the album was &quot;Nature Trail to Hell&quot;, about a fictional slasher film &quot;in 3-D&quot;; 3D film had enjoyed a brief resurgence in 1981–83, with the likes of &quot;Parasite&quot;, &quot;Friday the 13th Part III&quot; and &quot;Amityville 3-D&quot; being successful 3-D horrors. At the 3:40 mark, the song has a backward message that says &quot;Satan eats Cheez Whiz!&quot; This, in turn, was a parody of the Satanic backmasking scare during the early 1980s. Online magazine Pitchfork Media has alluded to the song several times, once comparing it to &quot;Thrill Kill&quot; by the Damned, and another time sarcastically calling the song a &quot;classic&quot;.

===Parodies and polka===

The first parody recorded for the album was &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, a parody of &quot;The Safety Dance&quot; by Men Without Hats, in which the narrator expresses his dislike of the sitcom &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; and suggests that the viewer watch something else, like &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;, &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, or MTV. The song also contains a lyrical adaptation of the &quot;Brady Bunch Theme Song&quot;. Recorded on the same day as &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, &quot;I Lost on Jeopardy&quot; is a parody of &quot;Jeopardy&quot; by the Greg Kihn Band. The song describes a situation in which the narrator loses spectacularly on the game show &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;. Show announcer Don Pardo lends his voice to a segment of the song. In order to create the parody, Yankovic cleared the idea not only with Greg Kihn, but also with Merv Griffin, who created the show. Don Pardo, Art Fleming, and Kihn all appeared in the music video. Kihn, the composer of the original song, was extremely pleased and flattered by the parody. In 2009, Kihn wrote a blog on his MySpace called &quot;Weird Al and Mailbox Money&quot;, in which he complimented Yankovic&#x27;s comedy and explained the mechanics of how a parody works. Kihn referred to the royalty checks he still receives from &quot;I Lost on Jeopardy&quot; as &quot;Mailbox Money&quot;.

The next parodies to be recorded were &quot;Theme from Rocky XIII (The Rye or the Kaiser)&quot;, a parody of Survivor&#x27;s &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot;, about a washed-up Rocky Balboa who now runs a deli and occasionally beats up on the liverwurst; and &quot;King of Suede&quot;, a parody of the Police&#x27;s &quot;King of Pain&quot;, about a clothing store owner who claims the titular title. In order to research information for the latter, Yankovic would walk around in fabric stores taking notes. He later remarked, &quot;I got a lot of nasty stares from store managers.&quot;

The final parody recorded for the album was &quot;Eat It&quot;, a parody of Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Beat It&quot;, about an exasperated parent whose picky child is refusing to eat. Yankovic formulated the idea during a brainstorming session between himself, Robert K. Weiss, and his manager, Jay Levey. They were bouncing ideas off one another until suddenly &quot;[they] had the whole thing written.&quot; Although he knew that the best way to get permission to parody a song was through the official songwriter, Yankovic was unsure what type of reaction he would get from Jackson when presented with the parody lyrics. However, Jackson allegedly thought it was a &quot;funny idea&quot;, and allowed the parody. In the mockumentary &quot;The Compleat Al&quot;, there is a scene portraying the fictitious meeting of Yankovic and Jackson. Musically, the parody is slightly different from the original, being set in a changed key, comic sound effects, and an Eddie Van Halen-inspired guitar solo from Yankovic&#x27;s producer, Rick Derringer.

&quot;Eat It&quot; was Yankovic&#x27;s first—and, until &quot;Smells Like Nirvana&quot; (1992), his only—Top Forty hit, peaking at number twelve on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It was also Yankovic&#x27;s highest-charting single until &quot;White &amp; Nerdy&quot; reached number nine on the October 21, 2006, &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. &quot;Eat It&quot; was a worldwide hit, even managing to peak at number one in Australia. For many years, Yankovic became known colloquially as &quot;The &#x27;Eat It&#x27; guy.&quot; He referred to this sarcastically on his own personal Twitter; at one point, Al&#x27;s Twitter Bio read: &quot;You know ... the Eat It guy.&quot;

One of the last songs recorded for the album was &quot;Polkas on 45&quot;. The song, whose title is a take on the novelty act Stars on 45, is a medley of popular rock songs from the 1960s and 1970s. &quot;Polkas on 45&quot; evolved from an early polka medley that Yankovic had played when opening for new wave band Missing Persons in 1982. This early version included parts of various new wave songs, including &quot;Jocko Homo&quot; by Devo, &quot;Homosapien&quot; by Pete Shelley, &quot;Sex Junkie&quot; by Plasmatics, &quot;T.V.O.D.&quot; by the Normal, &quot;Bad Boys Get Spanked&quot; by the Pretenders, &quot;TV Party&quot; by Black Flag, &quot;Janitor&quot; by Suburban Lawns, and &quot;People Who Died&quot; by Jim Carroll. After being asked how he picked the songs to include, Yankovic responded, &quot;I just pick songs that sound slightly better done polka style—the way God intended.&quot;

==Critical reception==

The album received a score of four and a half stars from AllMusic, with Eugene Chadbourne saying, &quot;With an album behind him, Weird Al Yankovic makes much of the improvements expected of new artists when they get a second crack at a release a year later.&quot; Christopher Thelen from &quot;The Daily Vault&quot; wrote that &quot;All in all, this disc held out the promise that Yankovic was destined for greatness ...&quot; In addition, &quot;&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic in 3-D&quot; was also named one of the Year&#x27;s Top 10 Albums in 1984 by &quot;People&quot; magazine. Den of Geek even named &quot;In 3-D&quot; as one of the &quot;10 Reasons Why 1984 Was a Great Year for Geek Movies&quot;—despite it not being a movie. On November 1, 2011, &quot;Spin&quot; magazine named &quot;In 3-D&quot; as the seventeenth greatest comedy album of all time.

Not all reviews were positive, however. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; gave the album a C+ rating, calling it &quot;&quot;Mad&quot; for the ears.&quot; Some critics were split on how Yankovic composed, performed, and recorded his parodies, compared to his 1983 debut album. The Daily Vault commented thus:

Many of the songs and singles from &quot;In 3-D&quot; would later appear on greatest hits albums. &quot;Eat It&quot; and &quot;I Lost on Jeopardy&quot; appeared both on Yankovic&#x27;s first greatest hits album (1988) and on &quot;The Essential &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&quot; (2009); the latter also included &quot;Polkas on 45&quot;. Seven of the album&#x27;s songs (&quot;Polkas on 45&quot;, &quot;Midnight Star&quot;, &quot;Eat It&quot;, &quot;Mr. Popeil&quot;, &quot;I Lost on Jeopardy&quot;, &quot;Buy Me a Condo&quot;, and &quot;King of Suede&quot;) appeared in Yankovic&#x27;s box set &quot;Permanent Record: Al in the Box&quot;.

At the 27th Grammy Awards in 1985, &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic won his first Grammy Award, the Best Comedy Performance Single or Album, Spoken or Musical, for his hit single &quot;Eat It&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic in 3-D&quot; was released on February 28, 1984. On April 28, it peaked at number 17, where it remained for three consecutive weeks. &quot;In 3-D&quot; spent a total of twenty-three weeks on the chart. It was also successful in Australia, where it peaked at number 61 on the album chart. Many of the album&#x27;s singles also went on to be successful. &quot;Eat It&quot; eventually sold over a half a million copies, peaked at number twelve domestically on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and was certified Gold. It was also a worldwide hit, peaking at number thirty-six in the United Kingdom and number one in Australia. As of March 2012, &quot;Eat It&quot; is currently Yankovic&#x27;s only number one single in any country. &quot;King of Suede&quot; and &quot;I Lost on Jeopardy&quot;, the album&#x27;s follow up singles, peaked on the Hot 100 at numbers 61 and 82, respectively.

On April 30, 1984, two months after its release, the album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), making it Yankovic&#x27;s first Gold record. On August 18, 1995, it was certified Platinum by the RIAA.

<text>&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic is the debut studio album by the American parody musician of the same name. The album was the first of many produced by former The McCoys guitarist Rick Derringer. Mostly recorded in March 1982, the album was released by Rock &#x27;n Roll Records as an LP and on Compact Cassette in 1983.

Consisting of five direct parodies and seven original songs, &quot;&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&quot; parodies pop and rock music of the late 1970s and early 1980s, and satirizes American culture and experiences of the same time period. Nearly half of the album is made up of parodies based on the works of Toni Basil, The Arrows, Stevie Nicks, the Knack and Queen. Yankovic&#x27;s trademark instrument—the accordion—is used on all songs featured on the album.

Fueled by the underground success of the singles &quot;My Bologna&quot; and &quot;Another One Rides the Bus&quot;, the album charted at No. 139 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Critically, the album received a lukewarm reception, with many reviewers feeling that Yankovic was a throw-away act who would not be able to overcome the stigma of a novelty record. Retrospective assessments have been slightly more favorable, though have still unfavorably compared it to Yankovic&#x27;s subsequent work.

==Production==

After hearing Yankovic&#x27;s parody of his song &quot;I Love Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, &quot;I Love Rocky Road&quot;, songwriter Jake Hooker suggested to guitarist Rick Derringer that he would be the perfect producer for the burgeoning parodist. Agreeing, Derringer used his music industry prestige and convinced Cherokee Studios to record an album&#x27;s worth of Yankovic&#x27;s songs gratis, to be paid from sales revenue. Then, in March 1982, &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic stepped into a professional recording studio for the first time and recorded nine of the songs for &quot;&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&quot;.
After encountering difficulty picking up a record label for the first-time album, Jay Levey (a Los Angeles artists&#x27; manager) provided KIQQ-FM with a copy of &quot;I Love Rocky Road&quot;. Impressing the program director of the Top 40 station, he played it immediately; &quot;I Love Rocky Road&quot; was one of the most-requested songs by the next day. At the same time, Rock &#x27;n Roll Records president Tad Dowd had been trying to convince parent company Scotti Brothers Records to sign the 22-year-old Yankovic. The positive furor over the KIQQ playtest provided Dowd with the leverage needed to convince Scotti Bros. to offer a contract for Yankovic&#x27;s first album.

Scotti Brothers Records&#x27; contract planned an April 1983 release date for a twelve-track album: &quot;I Love Rocky Road&quot; and eight other tracks were already recorded, &quot;Another One Rides the Bus&quot; would be the original 1980 live recording from &quot;The Dr. Demento Show&quot;, and the last two songs (&quot;Ricky&quot; and &quot;Buckingham Blues&quot;) would be recorded at Scotti Brothers&#x27; own studios in Santa Monica, California in February 1983.
To promote the album, Levey coordinated a three-week tour in late Summer 1983 across the United States&#x27; East Coast and Midwest for both Yankovic and Dr. Demento. Promoted as &quot;&quot;An Evening of Dementia with Dr. Demento in Person Plus &#x27;Weird Al&#x27; Yankovic&quot;, Demento opened with recorded hits and short comedy films from his show before introducing Yankovic and the band. During their three weeks, the tour played in several famous clubs, including The Bottom Line in New York City.

The album cover for &quot;&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&quot; was designed by Brazilian artist Rogerio. The band chose Rogerio because of his &quot;&quot;Mad&quot; magazine-like drawing style.&quot; The cover art specifically features individual elements that correspond with each of the album&#x27;s twelve songs.

==Composition==

&quot;&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&quot; is the only album in Yankovic&#x27;s discography to use the accordion in every song; in subsequent albums it is only used where deemed appropriate or wholly inappropriate for comedic effect. &quot;Ricky&quot; is a parody of &quot;Mickey&quot; by Toni Basil; an ode to &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; with Yankovic performing as Ricky and Tress MacNeille as Lucy. &quot;Gotta Boogie&quot; is a play on words discussing a man with a &quot;boogie&quot; on his finger and his quandary therein. &quot;I Love Rocky Road&quot; is a parody of Arrows&#x27; &quot;I Love Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; made famous by Joan Jett; in the song the narrator expresses feelings about the titular ice cream flavor. &quot;Buckingham Blues&quot; is a blues song satirizing the socialite lifestyle of the Prince and Princess of Wales (Prince Charles and Diana). Originally, the song was going to be a parody of &quot;Jack &amp; Diane&quot; by John Mellencamp; worried about spoiling a &quot;Jack and Diane&quot; movie deal, Mellencamp shot down the parody. Yankovic considered tweaking the &quot;Jack &amp; Diane&quot; melody to avoid the song being a true parody, but decided against it and later rewrote it as an original song. Answering a fan in 1998, Yankovic replied that he would not rewrite and rerecord the song in light of the death of Diana. He would later perform a parody of &quot;Jack &amp; Diane&quot; titled &quot;Homer and Marge&quot; for a 2003 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; called &quot;Three Gays of the Condo&quot;.

&quot;Happy Birthday&quot; is a style parody of Tonio K, one of Yankovic&#x27;s favorite artists. The song is a morbidly depressing birthday song detailing ails of the world, including poverty, nuclear holocaust, and eventual solar cataclysm. Only seeing two popular birthday songs at the time—&quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot; by Patty and Mildred J. Hill, and &quot;Birthday&quot; by the Beatles—Yankovic decided to write his own &quot;severely twisted version of one.&quot; &quot;Stop Draggin&#x27; My Car Around&quot; is a parody of &quot;Stop Draggin&#x27; My Heart Around&quot; by Stevie Nicks; the lament of an otherwise &quot;cool guy&quot; forced to repeatedly save his 1964 Plymouth car from impoundment due to illegal parking, shame, and non-payment. &quot;My Bologna&quot; is a parody of &quot;My Sharona&quot; by the Knack; the narrator talks about his obsession with bologna sausage. This is a re-recording of the song; the original Capitol Records single version would not appear on a &quot;Weird Al&quot; album until the 1994 box set &quot;Permanent Record: Al in the Box&quot;. &quot;The Check&#x27;s in the Mail&quot; parodies business-related prevarications, exampling avoidance, litigation, and the titular payment delay. &quot;Another One Rides the Bus&quot; is a parody of &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; by Queen; the narrator laments about a crowded public bus. This is the original 1980 recording from &quot;The Dr. Demento Show&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Mellow When I&#x27;m Dead&quot; is a rejection of the stereotypical attitudes and accoutrements of the hippie/yuppie lifestyles.

&quot;Such a Groovy Guy&quot; parodies narcissism specifically noting fashion, demeanor, dominance and submission, and relationship breakup. Yankovic wrote the song for a woman he was dating in homage of her previous boyfriend who, upon the breakup asked her, &quot;I&#x27;m such a groovy guy! Why would you break up with me?&quot; Out of concern the individual may not be aware of his status, Yankovic does not identify him. &quot;Mr. Frump in the Iron Lung&quot; is an audience favorite from Yankovic&#x27;s days playing in coffeehouses at Cal Poly; the song describes the rather lopsided relationship between the narrator and the eponymous &quot;Mr. Frump&quot; in his iron lung, until the latter&#x27;s death. The sound of the iron lung is an accordion&#x27;s air release valve. &quot;It&#x27;s Still Billy Joel to Me&quot;, Yankovic&#x27;s 1980 parody of Billy Joel&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Still Rock and Roll to Me&quot;, was originally planned for this album. Wary of the song being considered &quot;dated&quot; three years later, and doubtful that Joel would give his blessing, the band never bothered to ask. &quot;Yoda&quot;, Yankovic&#x27;s parody of the Kinks&#x27; song &quot;Lola&quot;, was written in 1980 (during the initial theatre run of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;) and was a &quot;huge hit&quot; on &quot;The Dr. Demento Show&quot;. However, the complexities of receiving permission from filmmaker George Lucas and the Kinks&#x27; publishers delayed its release until 1985.

==Promotion and tour==
To promote the album, the songs &quot;Ricky&quot; and &quot;I Love Rocky Road&quot; were released as singles with accompanying music videos. Yankovic embarked on his first official concert tour, officially named &quot;An Evening of Dementia with Dr. Demento in Person Plus &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&quot;, which began at the Bottom Line in New York City on May 21, 1983 and ended June 10, 1983 at Mickey&#x27;s in Milwaukee.

==Critical reception==

Eugene Chadbourne, reviewer for AllMusic, felt that while &quot;&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&quot; was a detailed harbinger of parody to come, the album does not hold up well on its own. Chadbourne extolled most of the parodies (&quot;Another One Rides the Bus&quot;, &quot;My Bologna&quot;, &quot;I Love Rocky Road&quot;) for their comedic value in contrast with their originals. However, also according to Chadbourne, &quot;Ricky&quot; lacks the comedic connection Yankovic cultivates in later albums, and the original songs &quot;may not seem like they were written in ten minutes, but the ideas behind them don&#x27;t seem to involve that much contemplation. [They&#x27;re] like little bits of puff [whose ...] impact on the flow of an album side is more like ballast.&quot;

Introducing Yankovic as the guest DJ for &quot;All Songs Considered&quot; on National Public Radio in 2006, host Bob Boilen opined that upon his debut, Yankovic &quot;seemed the epitome of a throw-away novelty act&quot;. Reviewing Yankovic in 2008, Brian Raftery of &quot;Wired&quot; magazine wrote that &quot;Ricky&quot; introduced the world to &quot;an accordion-playing spaz with a coif like Rick James and a voice like an urgent goose.&quot; Raftery noted that in 1983, Yankovic was considered a fad of the time—&quot;like parachute pants and Contras&quot;—and &quot;thoroughly disposable.&quot; Musical databasing and review websites AllMusic and Artistdirect rated &quot;&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&quot; three and a half out of five stars.

<text>The Fionavar Tapestry is a book series of fantasy novels by Canadian author Guy Gavriel Kay, published between 1984 and 1986. The novels are set in both contemporary Toronto and the secondary world of Fionavar.

==Premise==
Five University of Toronto senior law and medical students who are drawn into the &#x27;first world of the Tapestry&#x27; by the mage Loren Silvercloak. Once there, each character discovers their own role and destiny in the framework of an ancient conflict.

==Books in the series==
===Primary===
*&quot;The Summer Tree&quot;
*&quot;The Wandering Fire&quot;
*&quot;The Darkest Road&quot;
===Secondary===
&quot;Ysabel&quot;, while not part of &quot;The Fionavar Tapestry&quot; proper, features two of the same characters and often refers to the events of the trilogy.

==Characters==
===The Five===
====University of Toronto students====
* Kevin Laine (Liadon) is described as witty, bright, outgoing, and spirited. He has fair-coloured hair, and is characterized to be often intensely and deeply affected by acts of love.
* Paul Schafer (Pwyll Twiceborn) is described to be highly intelligent and withdrawn. At the beginning of the story, he is haunted by the death of his girlfriend in a car accident that he believes was his fault.
* Dave Martyniuk (Davor) is a star basketball player who carries emotional scars from his Eastern European immigrant father&#x27;s rough treatment of him as a child. Throughout the story, he has difficulty accepting or offering friendship.
* Kimberly Ford (The Seer) is portrayed to be quiet, intelligent, sensitive, but decisive.
* Jennifer Lowell (Guinevere) is described as cool and reserved. She is considered beautiful, and has green eyes. In the backstory, she is a former lover of Kevin&#x27;s, but they remain good friends.

===Arthurian characters===
The story borrows elements of medieval literature, particularly King Arthur, who is known to the characters in the books as &quot;The Warrior&quot;. Other notable inclusions are Lancelot and Guinevere. Parts of the story focuses on reenactment of the Arthurian stories.

===The Deities===
*The Weaver is the creator of the tapestry, the fabric of time, causality and existence, and all the worlds within the trilogy. They are described by the inhabitants of Fionavar as a &quot;hands-off&quot; deity, who acts only to bring about events required by fate (the &quot;weave of the Tapestry&quot;) and who otherwise does not interfere with free will. It is mentioned that The Weaver&#x27;s only law is that the gods cannot act directly upon the Tapestry without being summoned and bound by mortals. To do so always requires sacrifice, a rule which is enforced by other gods if it is violated. The gods can, however, act indirectly by choosing mortal champions and bestowing gifts and powers upon them.
*Mörnir is the lord of the summer tree, the patron god of the royal house of the High Kingdom of Brennin. He is described to be a sky god who is connected with ravens and oak trees.
*Dana is the goddess of the earth and the moon and written as the &quot;mother, sister, daughter, bride of the God&quot;. She is stated to be an earth mother deity worshipped by the Priestesses of Gwen Ystrat, the ruler of blood magic and the &quot;avarlith&quot;, the power derived from the earth. Her name is directly inspired by the Irish goddess Danu.
*Ceinwen is a goddess of the wood and the hunt who is revered by the Dalrei, a tribal people of the plains of Fionavar. She is seen to kill all men of Fionavar who witness her hunting.
*Cernan of the Beasts is the god of animals and wild things who is also revered by the Dalrei. He is characterized to be crowned with the antlers of a stag. His name is derived from the Celtic deity Cernunnos.
*Macha and Nemain are twin goddesses of war who are directly inspired by the Irish mythological figures associated with The Morrigan.
*Liranan is the god of the sea, whose name is derived from the Celtic deity Manannan mac Lir.
*Owein and the Wild Hunt is a group of once-mortal kings who together comprise a cosmic force of randomness and wildness; their existence is said to be necessary for mortals to have free will. In the books, they are described to be bound to the Cave of the Sleepers and can be woken and summoned by the artifact Owein&#x27;s Horn but must be led by a mortal child who becomes one of them and rides with them. The group is inspired by the Wild Hunt of European folklore. 
*Rakoth Maugrim is the renegade god, characterized as the enemy of the Weaver. In the series, he is seen being jealous of the Weaver&#x27;s creation, and breaks into Fionavar just as the Weaver completes his work. Since he came from outside the Weaver&#x27;s Loom, he has no thread in the Tapestry and cannot be destroyed. A thousand years ago before the trilogy is set, the combined might of all the races of Fionavar fought against him, and after a tremendous battle, they defeated him and chained him beneath the mountain Rangat. His eventual escape begins the events of the trilogy.
*Galadan is the lord of the Andain, which is defined as an offspring of a mating between god and mortal. He is seen to be a shapechanger who can take the form of a malevolent black wolf with a silver splash on its head. He is described to be nihilistic. 
*Flidais is another Andain who lives in Pendaran Wood who claims to have lived as the legendary bard Taliesin in the trilogy&#x27;s version of Earth.
*Fordaetha of Ruk is the ice queen of the Barrens in the far north. She is seen to be able to freeze men by touching them.

===Other characters===
*Darien is the son of Jennifer and Rakoth Maugrim, Darien is described to be precisely balanced between Dark and Light. He is seen to take the form of a white owl.
*Ailell dan Art is the High King of Brennin. He has two sons, the elder Aileron, who is in exile. The younger Diarmuid is described to be a fearless and elegant fighter, but also frivolous, impulsive, and shallow. Diarmuid falls in love with and is eventually betrothed to Sharra in the series, who is known as the Dark Rose of Cathal.
*Council of the Mages, which includes Loren Silvercloak, and his source Matt Sören, a dwarf; Metran, First Mage, and his source Denbarra; Teyrnon, and his source Barak. According to the story, each source is bound to the mage he serves by magical rituals and oaths, and provides from his lifeforce the energy needed to power the mage&#x27;s magic works. This link can be drawn upon even to the source&#x27;s death, although this will then render the mage permanently powerless. The Book of Nilsom, (a grimoire belonging to a mad mage of the past), is a book in the trilogy described to include secret knowledge of an abominable method by which a mage may gain power from multiple sources. The Council of the Mages is headquartered in Brennin and said to include up to seven mages. At the time of the story, there are only three.
*The Dalrei are seen to be plains-dwelling tribes of nomadic hunters who both hunt and guard the vast herds of eltor in the northern part of Fionavar. Each tribe is led by its chieftain, helped by the tribe&#x27;s shaman, who is ritually blinded in youth the better to focus the sight of his inner eye. The Third Tribe, under the leadership of Ivor dan Bannor and their shaman, Gereint is a major character in the trilogy. Ivor&#x27;s wife Leith, and their children Levon, Tabor and Cordeliane also play important parts.
*The lios alfar or Light Elves, live in Daniloth, which is described as a beautiful land in the northwest corner of the land which is wrapped in a confusing mist as protection from Maugrim and others who wish them evil. The lios alfar are said to be Maugrim&#x27;s bitterest foes, &quot;most hated by the dark, for their name is light&quot; (ST, p. 138).
*The dwarves dwell in the mountains near the twin peaks of Banir Lök and Banir Tal. Before the exposition of the story, fierce fighters have recently been led into questionable acts by Kaen and Blöd.
*The Men of Eridu, a proud and independent race, have been wiped out by a mysterious poisonous rain before the beginning of the trilogy. The only remaining man is Faebur, who is in exile and thus not present during the rainfall.
*The Paraiko, the peaceful giants of the mountains. In the story&#x27;s setting, the ancient Paraiko long ago bound Owein and the Wild Hunt to obey Connla&#x27;s Horn. The Paraiko refuse violence even in self-defense; in exchange, they are protected by the curse of the Paraiko, drawn down on whoever sheds their blood.

===Creatures===
*Avaia, a black swan with vicious teeth and an odor of corruption. They are a servant of Maugrim.
*Curdardh, nicknamed &quot;the Eldest&quot;, who is a metamorphosing earth-demon of rock and stone who dwells in and guards Pendaran Wood.
*Imraith-Nimphais, a flying red unicorn, this ability being a gift of Dana for the war against Maugrim.
*Uathach, an &quot;enhanced&quot; urgach who, with Galadan, directs Maugrim&#x27;s forces in battle.
*&quot;Urgach&quot;, who are large powerful warriors of the dark.
*&quot;Svart alfar,&quot; which are small, loathsome, dispensable dark creatures that eat men and elves.

==Themes==
Kay&#x27;s central concept in the novels is that Fionavar is the first of worlds, particularly in a mythological sense; the sagas and tales of other worlds originate (or culminate) in this most primary of settings. Because of this, what happens in Fionavar ripples into other worlds—thus, the victory or defeat of Rakoth Maugrim has immediate importance for Fionavar and implications for the fictional Earth within the trilogy.

The story puts an emphasis on the importance of free will, as demonstrated in Jennifer&#x27;s decisions to keep Darien and later to send Lancelot away, Finn&#x27;s choice to follow his destiny with Owein and the Wild Hunt, Paul and Kevin&#x27;s acceptance of the role of sacrifice (though in different ways), Diarmuid&#x27;s decision to take the final battle with Uathach on himself enabling Arthur to survive the last battle, and the importance of Darien&#x27;s ultimate choice of allegiance at the end. When the Baelrath (the &quot;Warstone&quot;), a ring given to Kim by Ysanne which is crafted to call various powers into the battle against the Dark, demands that Kim summon and bind the secret power in the Dwarves&#x27; sacred lake of Calor Diman, she refuses due to her characterized moral reasons.

Another theme is that of forgiveness. For example, Arthur has long since forgiven Guinevere and Lancelot; throughout the series, one of Paul&#x27;s goal is to learn to forgive himself for his girlfriend Rachel&#x27;s death; Galadan, in the end, is forgiven his evil past and offered a second chance; Darien at the end understands his mother&#x27;s treatment of him and forgives her.

One prominent theme is power and the price one pays for it. Often in the book, the price for power lies with someone else, as witnessed by the sources to the mages; as well as Kim&#x27;s summoning power, the fee is often paid by whatever or whoever was summoned.

==References and inspirations==
===Real world===
Stonehenge is featured in the second book. The ancient caves of Dun Maura are inspired by the Oracle at Delphi as well as prehistoric caves such as Lascaux. The association of blood with magic (Kevin/Liadon, the &quot;avarlith&quot;) are inspired by ancient mythologies. The Dalrei are shown to share many aspects of Native American lifestyle, beliefs and ritual, including being nomadic, and the significant role of shamans. 

===Tolkien===
Fionavar has many similarities to J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth, and may have been directly influenced by it (Kay worked with Christopher Tolkien to edit &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; and prepare it for publication). The map of Fionavar shares many similarities to that of Tolkien&#x27;s world.

===Myths and legends===
The stories incorporate, directly or indirectly, several other myths, the most direct being King Arthur, with Arthur, Lancelot, and Guinevere/Jennifer, who in the story works out their love triangle and atones for their sins. Kay uses a fragment of the Arthurian cycle, the May Babies, to explain Arthur&#x27;s punishment of repeated rebirth/death in battle against evil, as shown in &quot;[T]he Weaver had marked him down for a long unwinding doom. A cycle of war and expiation under many names, and in many worlds, that redress be made for the children and for love&quot; (WF, p.40). The grey dog who fights Galadan to protect Paul is shown to be Cavall, a dog from King Arthur&#x27;s stories. Lancelot&#x27;s encounter with Leyse of the lios alfar, her love for him, and subsequent departure by boat for the lios alfar&#x27;s home in the West is a retelling of the tale of Lancelot and Elaine of Astolat. When Leyse of the Swan Mark, a member of the lios alfar, gives up her life as a result of her hopeless love for Lancelot, she lies down in a boat and sails away, which is a retelling of Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;The Lady of Shalott,&quot; and the story of Elaine.

The powerful oak known as the Summer Tree is similar to Yggdrasil, the World Ash Tree of Norse mythology. Norse elements also appear in Mörnir, who, with his twin ravens Thought and Memory (Odin&#x27;s Huginn and Muninn), and the epithet &quot;of the Thunder,&quot; is inspired by a combination of Thor and Odin. The lios alfar (light elves) and svart alfar (dark elves) are influenced by the Scandinavian Álfar.

The Cauldron of Khath Meigol and its powers of resurrection are inspired by Welsh mythology&#x27;s tale of the Cauldron of Annwn. A number of the deities may have Celtic or Welsh roots: Paul is known as Pwyll after his sacrifice, while Macha and Nemain are directly taken from Irish mythology. The wild boar that attacks Kevin, marking him as Liadon, closely resembles the Twrch Trwyth. Cader Sedat, the island where the renegade mage Metran works his dark magic in &quot;The Wandering Fire&quot;, is the analogue of Caer Sidi from the poem Preiddeu Annwfn, a poem that is, in the trilogy, ascribed to Taliesin, one of the names used by Flidais.

The Wild Hunt was a folk myth prevalent in former times across Germany, the Sub-Roman Britain and also Scandinavia.

The entrapment of Rakoth Maugrim the Unraveller is similar to one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature, &quot;The Journey to the West&quot;. In the prologue of &quot;The Summer Tree&quot;, Rakoth Maugrim is bound by five wardstones and imprisoned under Mount Rangat.

==Awards ==
*&quot;The Wandering Fire&quot; won the 1987 Prix Aurora Award in the English category.
*&quot;The Wandering Fire&quot; won the 1987 Casper Award for best speculative fiction.
*The author was nominated for a Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Adult Literature in 1985 for The &quot;Summer Tree&quot;.

<doc id="681860" wikidata="Q4745477" url="?curid=681860" title="American gamelan">
<text>American gamelan could refer to both instruments and music; the term has been used to refer to gamelan-style instruments built by Americans, as well as to music written by American composers to be played on gamelan instruments. American gamelan music usually has some relationship to the gamelan traditions of Indonesia, as found primarily on the islands of Java and Bali in a variety of styles. Many American compositions can be played on Indonesian or American-made instruments. Indonesian gamelan can be made of a variety of materials, including bronze, iron, or bamboo. American gamelan builders used all sorts of materials including aluminum, tin cans, car hubcaps, steel, antique milk-strainers, etc. &quot;American gamelan&quot; may also describe the original music of American ensembles working with traditional instruments.

Dennis Murphy is often credited as being the first American to build instruments modeled on those of the Javanese gamelan, circa 1960. This work led to his doctoral thesis at Wesleyan University, entitled &quot;The Autochthonous American Gamelan&quot;. Murphy started a gamelan group with his instruments at Goddard College in Vermont in 1967; that group later became the community-based Plainfield Village Gamelan.

There have been other American builders of gamelan as well, on both the East and West coasts. Following Murphy&#x27;s model was Barbara Benary, who built the instruments still used today for Gamelan Son of Lion. On the West coast, the airline industry made aluminum affordable, and this became the material of choice for several gamelan builders. Daniel Schmidt, a composer-builder, built an ensemble called &quot;The Berkeley Gamelan&quot; (independent of the University of California, Berkeley) as well as the set of instruments that would develop into Gamelan Pacifica in Seattle. Paul Dresher also used aluminum.

==Harrison and Colvig==

Harrison worked with John Cage in the 40s on percussion compositions with found metal objects, resulting in alternate scaled music. Lou Harrison and William Colvig, who met in 1967 in San Francisco, built a set of tuned percussion instruments that they called &quot;an American gamelan&quot; in order to differentiate it from Indonesian ensembles. It was first used in Harrison&#x27;s work &quot;La Koro Sutro&quot; in 1972. These are now referred to as &quot;Old Granddad&quot;, and Harrison wrote some pieces that can only be played on this set, including &quot;La Koro Sutro&quot;. Lou Harrison spent some time with a Javanese gamelan in 1976 (when Kyai Udan Mas, now at the University of California, Berkeley, was in residence at San Jose State University). This inspired him and his partner William Colvig to build a gamelan modelled specifically on Udan Mas (in instrumentation, although not in tuning). For this he used aluminum primarily, although the &quot;great gong&quot; was eventually fashioned out of iron.

Colvig and Harrison built two large &quot;double&quot; gamelan (meaning that there were instruments in both the pelog and slendro tunings). The first was Si Betty, named for the financial benefactor Betty Freeman. Si Betty was bequeathed to Jody Diamond, and was in residence at Harvard University from 2007 to 2017; in 2018, Si Betty moved to Bucknell University in Lewisburg, PA. The second was named &quot;Si Darius/Si Madeleine&quot; after Darius Milhaud and his wife, because it was while holding the Milhaud chair at Mills College (where the gamelan still resides) that Harrison and Colvig had the support for its construction; a group there (as of 2008) is directed by Daniel Schmidt. Lou Harrison was well known for his compositions for gamelan; he was particularly adept at combining western instruments with his Javanese-style gamelan ensemble. (The scores for all of his gamelan works are published by the American Gamelan Institute).

<text>The Switzerland national football team (, , , , ) represents Switzerland in men&#x27;s international football. The national team is controlled by the Swiss Football Association.

Switzerland&#x27;s best performances at the FIFA World Cup have been three quarter-finals appearances, in 1934, 1938 and 1954. They hosted the competitions in 1954, where they played against Austria in the quarter-finals match, losing 7–5, which still stands as the highest scoring World Cup match ever. At the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Switzerland set a FIFA World Cup record by being eliminated from the tournament despite not conceding a single goal, being eliminated by Ukraine after penalties in the round of sixteen. They did not concede a goal until a match against Chile at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, conceding in the 75th minute, setting a World Cup tournament record for consecutive minutes without conceding a goal.

Switzerland and Austria were the co-hosts of UEFA Euro 2008, where the Swiss made their third appearance in the competitions, but failed for a third time to progress from the group stage. However, since then, the Swiss made it to the round of 16 during Euro 2016, and achieved a record-best quarter-finals showing at Euro 2020 after eliminating world champions France.

Overall, Switzerland&#x27;s best ever result at an official football competition was the silver medal they earned in 1924, after losing to Uruguay 3–0 in the finals of the 1924 Olympic Games.

==History==
===1924–1966: early years, World Cup host nation===

At the 1924 Paris Olympic Games, Switzerland finished with a silver medal after losing to Uruguay in the final, losing 3–0. The team&#x27;s debut appearance at the World Cup was in 1934, where they reached the quarter-finals after beating the Netherlands 3–2 in the round of sixteen before getting knocked out by Czechoslovakia. Switzerland once again reached the quarter-finals in 1938, after beating Germany in the round of sixteen, winning 4–2 after a replay but were knocked out by Hungary, losing 2–0. At the 1950 World Cup, Switzerland were drawn in a group with Brazil, Yugoslavia and Mexico, where they lost 4–0 to Yugoslavia in the opening match, drew 2–2 with Brazil in their second match and beating Mexico 2–1 in their final group mach, and finished third in their group. On 22 July 1946, Switzerland was awarded the right to host the 1954 World Cup unopposed, in Luxembourg City. At the World Cup, Switzerland finished second in their group behind England; beating Italy and losing to England, but qualified for the quarter-finals after beating Italy in a group play-off. They were knocked out of the tournament after losing 7–5 to Austria. At the 1962 World Cup, Switzerland finished bottom of the group, losing all three games, losing 3–1 to Chile, 2–1 to West Germany and 3–0 to Italy. A similar result occurred at the 1966 World Cup, where Switzerland again finished at the bottom of their group losing all three of their matches, 5–0 to West Germany, 2–1 to Spain and 2–0 to Argentina.

===1992–1996: the Roy Hodgson era===
In 1992, Switzerland appointed English manager Roy Hodgson as head coach of the national team; at the time of his appointment, the Swiss had not qualified for any major tournament since 1966. Under his guidance, Switzerland rose to 3rd in the FIFA World Ranking in August 1993, which still remains their highest FIFA ranking to this day. Hodgson led Switzerland to the 1994 FIFA World Cup, losing just one game during qualifying, in a group that included Italy, Portugal, and Scotland. The Swiss won their home tie with Italy, and in the away game, took a 2–0 lead before being pegged back to a 2–2 draw, and also took four points from Scotland, winning 3–1 at home and drawing 1–1 away. Against the Portuguese, Switzerland drew 1–1 at home and lost 1–0 in the away fixture in Porto, their only defeat of the qualifying campaign. Their opening match against hosts United States, on 18 June 1994, was played indoors at the Pontiac Silverdome in Detroit, and the two teams drew 1–1 in the opening match of the World Cup. In the next match, they won 4–1 over Romania, and in their final game against Colombia, the Swiss lost 2–0. Nevertheless, Switzerland still qualified from the group, but were knocked out by Spain, losing 3–0.

===2000–2008: the Köbi Kuhn era===
At UEFA Euro 1996, Switzerland once again easily qualified for the tournament hosted in England, as they topped their qualifying group, losing just once, which was a 1–2 defeat to Turkey. They were drawn in Group A, but their tournament was disappointing overall; as they finished bottom of the group. Their opening match was against hosts England, and the two sides drew 1–1. In their second match, they lost 2–0 to the Netherlands, and in their final group game, lost 1–0 to Scotland. Switzerland failed to qualify for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, hosted in France, as they finished fourth in their qualifying group, winning three games; 3–2 against Finland, 1–0 against Hungary and 5–0 against Azerbaijan, drawing one game against Hungary (1–1), and losing three games; 1–0 against Azerbaijan and losing both games against Norway, losing 1–0 at home and 5–0 away.

In qualifying for UEFA Euro 2004, Switzerland finished top of a group that featured Russia, the Republic of Ireland, Albania and Georgia. The Swiss finished with 21 points and qualified for the finals in Portugal, where they were drawn in Group B with defending champions France, England and Croatia. They began the tournament with a 0–0 draw with Croatia before succumbing to a 3–0 defeat to England in the next match. They lost their final match against France; losing 3–1 and finishing bottom of the group. Their only goal of the entire tournament was scored by Johan Vonlanthen, who became the youngest ever goalscorer at the &quot;Euros&quot; when he scored the equalizing goal against France; surpassing the previous record set only four days earlier by Wayne Rooney by three months.

The Swiss managed to qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, overcoming Turkey by the away goals rule in Istanbul, the country&#x27;s first World Cup since 1994. In the tournament, Switzerland was drawn in Group G with former world champions France, 2002 World Cup&#x27;s fourth-place finisher South Korea and debutant Togo. In their first encounter, Switzerland bravely held the mighty France and Zinedine Zidane 0–0, before overcoming the Togolese 2–0 in the second match, tied with the South Koreans four points, however the Swiss were inferior to the Koreans by number of goals scored, meaning that the last game a must-win. The Swiss then managed to beat South Korea 2–0 in the final match, occupying first place in their group while knocking the Asians out of the tournament. In the round of sixteen, Switzerland faced Ukraine, but lost on penalty shootout in a match that has been criticized as the worst game in World Cup history. Yet, Switzerland was the only team to be eliminated without conceding a single goal.

Switzerland, along with Austria, were chosen as co-hosts of UEFA Euro 2008. The Swiss were drawn in Group A with Portugal, Turkey and the Czech Republic. Their opening match was a 1–0 loss to the Czech Republic, followed by a 1–2 defeat to Turkey. Their third match was against Portugal, with Switzerland winning 2–0 to ensure that Portugal would top their group with a defeat.

===2008–2014: the Ottmar Hitzfeld era===
In their first match at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the team defeated eventual champions Spain 1–0 with a goal by Gelson Fernandes, but they were still eliminated in the group stage. In the second match, a goal scored by Mark González in the 75th minute of the game against Chile ended a 559-minute streak without conceding a goal in World Cup matches, beating the record previously held by Italy by nine minutes. Switzerland did not advance further than the group after a 0–0 draw with Honduras in the third and final group match.
Switzerland did not qualify for UEFA Euro 2012; missing out on the tournament for the first time in a decade, as they finished third in the qualifying group, a group featuring England, Montenegro, Wales and Bulgaria. Switzerland&#x27;s initial start in qualifying was overall poor; losing 1–3 to England in the first game played, in which Xherdan Shaqiri scored his first goal for the national team, followed by a 1–0 defeat to Montenegro. Switzerland then recorded a 4–1 win over Wales before consecutive draws against Bulgaria (0–0) and England (2–2). Switzerland&#x27;s hopes of qualifying were restored with a 3–1 win over Bulgaria, with a hat-trick from Xherdan Shaqiri. However, following a 2–0 loss to Wales (in which Reto Ziegler earned a red card) and Montenegro&#x27;s surprising last-minute equalizer against England in a 2–2 draw, Switzerland&#x27;s hopes of qualifying were mathematically made impossible. In the final game, Switzerland earned redemption against Montenegro as they came out with a 2–0 win. Switzerland&#x27;s top goalscorer during the qualifying period was Xherdan Shaqiri, with 4 goals.

At the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, Switzerland were drawn to play France, Honduras and Ecuador in the group stage. They advanced to the round of sixteen with a 3–0 win over Honduras, with a hat-trick from Xherdan Shaqiri. In the knockout match against Argentina, they lost 1–0, conceding to Ángel Di María in the 118th minute.

===2016–2021: the Vladimir Petković era===
At Euro 2016, Switzerland were selected to play in Group A of the tournament; alongside hosts France, Albania and Romania. In the first game, Switzerland won 1–0 over Albania, with the only goal being scored by Fabian Schär in the fifth minute of the game. The next match was a 1–1 draw with Romania, with Switzerland initially conceding from a penalty but equalizing in the second half following a goal from Admir Mehmedi. The final group game was against France, drawing 0–0. However, the game spread notoriety for several Swiss players&#x27; jerseys being ripped during challenges with the French players, and also for the ball bursting during a challenge between Antoine Griezmann and Valon Behrami when they both converged on the ball, with the game also attracting attention for its poor surface, which was criticised by both coaches and players of the two teams; after the game, Switzerland&#x27;s kit manufacturer had blamed &quot;faulty material&quot; for the incidents regarding the jerseys being ripped. Switzerland, due to the draw, finished second in the group to set up a tie against Poland in the round of sixteen; initially the Swiss conceded but managed to find a late equalizer from Xherdan Shaqiri, who scored a bicycle-kick to send the game into extra-time, but the Swiss were knocked out as Granit Xhaka had missed the second penalty during the penalty shootout, as all other players managed to convert their penalties, with Poland winning 5–4 on penalties to go through and knock out the Swiss.
In qualifying for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Switzerland were drawn with Portugal, Hungary, Faroe Islands, Latvia and Andorra. The Swiss began their qualifying group with a shock 2–0 win over European champions Portugal, who had won the tournament less than two months prior to playing with them on 6 September. Afterwards, they beat Hungary 2–3, Andorra 2–1, Faroe Islands 2–0, Latvia 1–0 in the first five games, leading the group on maximum points. In the reverse fixtures, they beat Faroe Islands 2–0, Andorra 3–0, Latvia 3–0 and Hungary 5–2, before facing Portugal in the final group game, where they lost 2–0, meaning they would have to play in the play-offs; where they were ranked as the best second-placed team, and were drawn to play Northern Ireland. In the first leg, played on 9 November, they won 1–0 through a controversial penalty scored by Ricardo Rodríguez, and three days later played in the second leg, drawing 0–0 and advancing to the World Cup finals in Russia with a 1–0 aggregate win. Before the World Cup, Switzerland were ranked 6th in the world ranking, even ranking higher than eventual World Cup winners France.
At the World Cup, Switzerland were drawn to play Brazil, Serbia and Costa Rica in Group E. They began their campaign with a 1–1 draw with Brazil, before beating Serbia 2–1 through a late winning goal from Xherdan Shaqiri. The game with Serbia sparked controversy for the celebrations performed by goalscorers Xherdan Shaqiri and Granit Xhaka (both ethnic Albanians), along with Stephan Lichtsteiner as the trio performed a celebration where they crossed their hands to depict a double-headed eagle, the official emblem of Albania, considered by many as an Albanian nationalist symbol, however, they were not banned by FIFA for this. Their final group game was with Costa Rica; which they drew 2–2, with Blerim Džemaili and Josip Drmić scoring; thus finishing second in the group. They were drawn to play Sweden in the round of sixteen, a fixture they lost 1–0, getting knocked out of the tournament.

On 23 January 2018, Switzerland were selected to play in the inaugural edition of the UEFA Nations League, a tournament contested by all UEFA member&#x27;s national teams, being drawn to play in League A, in Group 2, against Belgium and Iceland.

At Euro 2020, postponed to 2021 due to COVID-19, Switzerland finished third in Group A which contained Italy, Wales and Turkey; however, they managed to qualify to the knockout stage as one of the best third-placed teams. In the round of 16, they defeated World Cup champions France on penalties, after finishing 3–3 and overcoming a 1–3 second half deficit, to have their first knockout phase win in a major tournament since the 1938 World Cup. In the subsequent quarter-final game against Spain, they once again took the game to penalties, after trailing 1–0. However, after converting only one of their four penalties, they exited the tournament at this stage.

===2021–present: the Murat Yakin era===
On 9 August 2021, Yakin became the manager of the Swiss national team. During the 2022 World Cup qualification, Switzerland finished in the first place ahead of Italy in Group C, which granted them a spot in the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. During the World Cup, Switzerland finished second in Group G to qualify the round of 16, where they lost 6–1 to Portugal. In 2023, Switzerland played against Romania, Israel, Belarus, Kosovo, and Andorra to qualify for Euro 2024. The Swiss finished second behind Romania.

The Euro 2024 tournament was a major success for Switzerland, as they finished second in their group with 5 points, moving onto the Round of 16. During the Round of 16, Switzerland caused a major upset by defeating defending champions Italy and reaching the Quarter-Finals for the second time in their history.

===Kit===
The Switzerland national team&#x27;s traditional home kit is red shirts, white shorts and red socks, with the away kit being reverse with white shirts, red shorts and white socks, although the colours of the shorts and socks are interchangeable if there is a minor clash.

<text>Sportsman&#x27;s Park was the name of several former Major League Baseball ballpark structures in St. Louis, Missouri. All but one of these were located on the same piece of land, at the northwest corner of Grand Boulevard and Dodier Street, on the north side of the city.

==History==
Sportsman&#x27;s Park was the home field of both the St. Louis Browns of the American League, and the St. Louis Cardinals of the National League from 1920 to 1953, when the Browns relocated to Baltimore and were rebranded as the Orioles.

The physical street address was 2911 North Grand Boulevard. The ballpark (by then known as Busch Stadium, but still commonly called Sportsman&#x27;s Park) was also the home to professional football: in , it hosted St. Louis&#x27; first NFL team, the All-Stars, and later hosted the St. Louis Cardinals of the National Football League from 1960 (following the team&#x27;s relocation from Chicago) until 1965, with Busch Memorial Stadium opening its doors in 1966.

===1881 structure===
Baseball was played on the Sportsman&#x27;s Park site as early as 1867. The tract was acquired in 1866 by August Solari, who began staging games there the following year. It was the home of the St. Louis Brown Stockings in the National Association and the National League from 1875 to 1877. 

It was originally called the Grand Avenue Ball Grounds: some sources say the field was renamed Sportsman&#x27;s Park in 1876, although local papers were not using that name until 1881, and some local papers used the alternate name &quot;Grand Avenue Park&quot; until at least 1885. The first grandstand, one of three on the site, was built in 1881. At that time, the diamond and the grandstands were on the southeast corner of the block, for the convenience of fans arriving from Grand Avenue. The park was leased by the then-major American Association entry, the St. Louis &quot;Brown Stockings&quot;, or &quot;Browns&quot;. The Browns were a very strong team in the mid-1880s, but their success waned. 

When the National League absorbed the strongest of the old Association teams in 1892, the Browns were brought along. Soon they went looking for a new ballpark, finding a site just a few blocks northwest of the old one, and calling it New Sportsman&#x27;s Park, which was later renamed Robison Field. They also changed team colors from Brown to Cardinal Red, thus acquiring a new nickname, and leaving their previous team colors as well as the old ballpark site available.

After a fire at the Cardinals&#x27; ballpark on May 4, 1901, the club arranged to play some games at the original Sportsman&#x27;s Park, which by then was being called &quot;Athletic Park&quot; and had only minimal seating. After a May 5 game, it was clear that the old park would no longer be a workable option: the team played on the road for a month while their own park was being rebuilt.

===1902 and 1909 structures===

When the American League Milwaukee Brewers moved to St. Louis in 1902 and took the Browns name, they built a new version of Sportsman&#x27;s Park. They initially placed the diamond and the main stand at the northwest corner of the block.

This Sportsman&#x27;s Park saw football history made: it became both the practice field and home field for Saint Louis University football teams, coached by the visionary Eddie Cochems, father of the forward pass. Although the first legal forward pass was thrown by Saint Louis&#x27; Bradbury Robinson in a road game at Carroll College in September 1906, Sportsman&#x27;s Park was the scene of memorable displays of what Cochems called his &quot;air attack&quot; that season. These included a 39–0 thrashing of Iowa before a crowd of 12,000 and a 34–2 trouncing of Kansas witnessed by some 7,000. Robinson launched an amazingly long pass in the game against the Jayhawks, which was variously reported to have traveled 48, 67 or 87 yards in the air. College Football Hall of Fame coach David M. Nelson called the pass extraordinary, &quot;considering the size, shape and weight&quot; of the fat, rugby-style ball used at that time. Sports historian John Sayle Watterson agreed. In his book, &quot;College Football: History, Spectacle, Controversy&quot;, Watterson described Robinson&#x27;s long pass as &quot;truly a breathtaking achievement&quot;. St. Louis finished with an 11–0 record in 1906, outscoring its opponents 407–11.

In 1909, the Browns moved the diamond to its final location, at the southwest corner, in the shadow of a new steel and concrete grandstand, the third such stadium in the major leagues, and the second in the American League (after Shibe Park).

The previous wooden grandstand was retained as left-field bleachers for a while, but was soon replaced with permanent bleachers. The Cardinals came back to their original home in mid-1920, as tenants of the Browns, after abandoning the outdated and mostly-wooden Robison Field.

After nearly winning the American League pennant in 1922, Browns owner Phil Ball confidently predicted that there would be a World Series in Sportsman&#x27;s Park by 1926: in anticipation, he increased the capacity of his ballpark from 18,000 to 30,000. There &quot;was&quot; a World Series in Sportsman&#x27;s Park in 1926—but it was the Cardinals, not the Browns, who took part in it, with the Cardinals upsetting the Yankees in a memorable seventh game.

Although the Browns had been the stronger team in the city for the first quarter of the century, they had never been quite good enough to win a pennant: after the previously weak Cardinals had moved in, the two teams&#x27; situations had started to reverse, both on and off the field. The Cardinals&#x27; 1926 World Series victory more or less permanently tipped the balance in their favor, and from then on, the Cardinals were clearly St. Louis&#x27; favorite team, though still tenants of the Browns. The 1944 World Series between the Cardinals and the Browns, won by the Cardinals by four games to two, was perhaps a good metaphor for the two clubs&#x27; respective situations: it remains the last World Series to be played entirely in one stadium as the home venue for both competing clubs, with the exception of the neutral-site play in the 2020 World Series.
In addition to its primary use as a baseball stadium, Sportsman&#x27;s Park also hosted several soccer events. These included several in the St. Louis Soccer League, and the 1948 National Challenge Cup when St. Louis Simpkins-Ford defeated Brookhattan for the national soccer championship.

In 1936, Browns owner Phil Ball died. His family sold the Browns to businessman Donald Lee Barnes, but the Ball estate maintained ownership of Sportsman&#x27;s Park until 1946, when it was sold to the Browns for an estimated price of over US$1 million.

===1953 sale===
By the early 1950s, it was clear that St. Louis could not support both teams. Bill Veeck, owner of the Browns (who at one point lived with his family in an apartment under the park&#x27;s stands), fancied that he could drive the Cardinals out of town through his promotional skills. However, Veeck caught an unlucky break when the Cardinals&#x27; owner, Fred Saigh, pleaded no contest to tax evasion. Faced with certain banishment from baseball, Saigh sold the Cardinals to Anheuser-Busch in February 1953. Veeck soon realized that the Cardinals now had more resources at their disposal than he could ever hope to match. Reluctantly, he concluded he was finished in St. Louis, and had no other option but to move the Browns. 

As a first step, he sold Sportsman&#x27;s Park to the Cardinals for $800,000. Busch immediately renovated the stadium, which had not been well maintained in some time. Even with the rent from the Cardinals, the Browns had not been bringing in nearly enough revenue to bring the park up to code, with city officials even threatening to have the park condemned. Before the start of the next season, the Browns relocated to Baltimore and were rebranded as the Orioles.
The brewery originally wanted to name the ballpark Budweiser Stadium. Commissioner Ford Frick vetoed the name because of public relations concerns over naming a ballpark after a brand of beer. However, the commissioner could not stop Anheuser-Busch president August Busch, Jr. from renaming it after himself, so the park was renamed Busch Stadium. However, many fans still called it by the old name. The Anheuser-Busch &quot;eagle&quot; model that sat atop the left field scoreboard flapped its wings after a Cardinal home run. The next year, Anheuser-Busch introduced a new economy lager branded as &quot;Busch Bavarian Beer&quot;, thus gaming Frick&#x27;s ruling and allowing the ballpark&#x27;s name to be branded by what would eventually be Anheuser-Busch&#x27;s second most popular beer brand.

Sportsman&#x27;s Park / Busch Stadium was the site of a number of World Series contests, first way back in the mid-1880s, and then in the modern era. The 1964 Series was particularly memorable, the park&#x27;s last, and featured brother against brother, Ken Boyer of the Cardinals and Clete Boyer of the Yankees. The Cardinals&#x27; triumph in seven games led to Yankees management replacing Yogi Berra with the Cardinals&#x27; ex-manager Johnny Keane (he had resigned after winning the Series), an arrangement which lasted only to early 1966. Both Series managers were St. Louis natives, but neither had ever played for the Cardinals. The stadium also hosted Major League Baseball All-Star Games in 1940, 1948, and 1957.

===Replacement===
Despite Busch&#x27;s extensive renovations, it soon became apparent that Sportsman&#x27;s Park was at the end of its useful life. 

Parking at the stadium was almost non-existent. Its concrete-and-steel incarnation had been built only a year after the Model T was introduced, and the park had been designed in an era when fans took the trolley to games, meaning it was ill-suited to automobile access. Additionally, the neighborhood around the park had an increase in crime and dereliction starting in the late 1940s. In 1964, a Cardinals fan making his way to the home opener was shot and killed during an armed robbery.

Sportsman&#x27;s Park/Busch Stadium was replaced early in the 1966 season by Busch Memorial Stadium, during which time much was made of baseball having been played on the old site for more than a century. A helicopter carried home plate to Busch Memorial Stadium after the final game at Sportsman&#x27;s Park on May 8, 1966. The 1966 stadium was replaced forty years later by the new Busch Stadium in April 2006.
Donated by August Busch, the Sportsman&#x27;s Park site became home to the Herbert Hoover Boys Club, which is now Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Greater St. Louis. While the grandstand was torn down , the diamond was still intact at the time the structures were cleared, and the field is now used for other sports.

==Dimensions==
For a small park, there were plenty of posted distance markers. The final major remodeling was done in 1926. Distance markers had appeared by the 1940s:
The following links provide images of the field&#x27;s markers.
*Photo of left field markers
*Photo of center and right center field markers
*Photo of right field markers

The diamond was conventionally aligned east-northeast (home plate to center field), and the elevation of the field was approximately above sea level.

===Layout===
The left field and right field walls ran toward center, roughly perpendicular to the foul lines or at right angles to each other. The center field area was a short diagonal segment connecting the two longer walls. When distance markers were first posted, there was a 426 marker at the left corner of that segment, and a 422 marker at the right corner of it. There was another 422 marker a few feet to the left of the other one, and that marked &quot;true&quot; center field. For symmetry, a corresponding marker (425) was set a few feet to the right of the 426. The two corner markers were eventually painted over, leaving just the 425 and the true centerfield 422.

<text>L&#x27;Académie internationale d&#x27;Héraldique (known in English as the International Academy of Heraldry) was founded in Paris in 1949 to bring together experts in heraldry representing the various areas of the world. Admission is by election, and the number of active &quot;academicians&quot; is limited to 75. There is no limit to the number of &quot;associate members&quot;.

The general assembly usually meets once a year, and the headquarters of L&#x27;Académie are in Switzerland. The Académie&#x27;s aim is to centralize the heraldic studies on the basis of the largest possible international cooperation. Applications for admission are addressed to L&#x27;Académie in writing and must have the sponsorship of to members of the Council. On a bi-yearly basis, the Académie holds the &quot;International Heraldic Colloquium&quot;. Recent colloquia have been held in Antwerp (2019) and Copenhagen (2017).

Current president (since 2022) is Elizabeth Roads (UK) with Peter Kurrild-Klitgaard as secretary general.

<doc id="681871" wikidata="Q325155" url="?curid=681871" title="Yūichirō Miura">
<text>is a Japanese skier and alpinist.

==Early life==
Miura was born in Aomori City in northernmost Tōhoku region of northeast Japan on October 12, 1932. His father, Keizo Miura, was a Japanese skier. Yūichirō was exposed to snow sports from the time he was a child, and placed in his first skiing competition during his second grade year in elementary school. He moved south with his family but found that he missed the snow and winter sports, prompting him to enroll at Hokkaido University. There, he continued to pursue skiing as a professional sport.

== Career ==
Miura competed in speedskiing and downhill skiing. His advanced ability to ski, especially in the back-country, required him to reach high elevations by hiking, expanding the breadth of his skills to include wintertime Alpine mountaineering. Once he became a prolific mountain climber, Miura began challenging larger mountains and skied down many of them. While active in ski competitions, he competed for the average speed in the 100 meter section of the steep slope downhill. The world&#x27;s highest record was established in Italy in July 1964 with a speed of 172.084 km/h.

Miura became the first person to ski on Mount Everest on May 6, 1970. Using a parachute to slow his descent, he skied down nearly 6,600 vertical feet from the South Col (elevation over , before falling for some , and stopping just from plunging into the bergschrund at the upper reaches of the Khumbu Glacier. This feat was documented in 1975, in the film &quot;The Man Who Skied Down Everest&quot;. The film won the Academy Award for best documentary, the first sports film to do so. He also succeeded in skiing downhill at seven of the highest peaks in Europe from 1978 to 1985.

In 2003 at the age of 70, Miura became the oldest person to reach the summit of Mount Everest, a record he twice broke, the last time at the age of 80 in 2013. Even though he was unable to complete the descent after reaching the top, and was airlifted from Advanced Base Camp at 6500 meters rather than descending to the Base Camp at , his achievement is listed in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;. Famous alpinists, however, like Ken Noguchi, dispute Miura&#x27;s achievement, arguing that a climb can not be called “complete” unless one walks all the way down the mountain.

Gota Miura, freestyle skier and alpinist, is one of Miura&#x27;s sons.

<doc id="681875" wikidata="Q2638561" url="?curid=681875" title="General covariance">
<text>In theoretical physics, general covariance, also known as [[diffeomorphism]] covariance or general invariance, consists of the invariance of the &quot;form&quot; of physical laws under arbitrary differentiable coordinate transformations. The essential idea is that coordinates do not exist &quot;a priori&quot; in nature, but are only artifices used in describing nature, and hence should play no role in the formulation of fundamental physical laws. While this concept is exhibited by general relativity, which describes the dynamics of spacetime, one should not expect it to hold in less fundamental theories. For matter fields taken to exist independently of the background, it is almost never the case that their equations of motion will take the same form in curved space that they do in flat space.

==Overview==
A physical law expressed in a generally covariant fashion takes the same mathematical form in all coordinate systems, and is usually expressed in terms of tensor fields. The classical (non-quantum) theory of electrodynamics is one theory that has such a formulation.

Albert Einstein proposed this principle for his special theory of relativity; however, that theory was limited to spacetime coordinate systems related to each other by uniform &quot;inertial&quot; motion, meaning relative motion in any straight line without acceleration. Einstein recognized that the general principle of relativity should also apply to accelerated relative motions, and he used the newly developed tool of tensor calculus to extend the special theory&#x27;s global Lorentz covariance (applying only to inertial frames) to the more general local Lorentz covariance (which applies to all frames), eventually producing his general theory of relativity. The local reduction of the metric tensor to the Minkowski metric tensor corresponds to free-falling (geodesic) motion, in this theory, thus encompassing the phenomenon of gravitation.

Much of the work on classical unified field theories consisted of attempts to further extend the general theory of relativity to interpret additional physical phenomena, particularly electromagnetism, within the framework of general covariance, and more specifically as purely geometric objects in the spacetime continuum.

== Remarks ==
The relationship between general covariance and general relativity may be summarized by quoting a standard textbook:

A more modern interpretation of the physical content of the original principle of general covariance is that the Lie group GL4(R) is a fundamental &quot;external&quot; symmetry of the world. Other symmetries, including &quot;internal&quot; symmetries based on compact groups, now play a major role in fundamental physical theories.

<text>Plzeň Region or Plzeňský Region (also known as Pilsen Region; ) is an administrative unit () of the Czech Republic, located in the western part of the historical land of Bohemia and named after the capital, Plzeň. In terms of area, Plzeň Region is 7,561 km2, the third largest region in the Czech Republic. However, with a population of about 585,000 inhabitants it is the ninth most populous region. After the South Bohemian Region it is the second least densely populated region. The region can be roughly divided into two parts: a highly industrialized north-eastern part with a strong engineering tradition around Pilsen () and a more hilly and rural south-western part with smaller-sized manufacturing companies processing natural resources.

The region borders the Karlovy Vary Region (to the north-west), Ústí nad Labem Region (to the north), Central Bohemian Region (north-east), South Bohemian Region (to the east) and with Bavaria (part of Germany) in the south-west and west. The region was established based on the constitutional Act No. 347/97 of Collections concerning the formation of higher territorial administrative units. The region and its authorities are specified by Act No. 129/2000 of Collections concerning regions, which came into effect on the day of the regional authorities elections, or on 1 January 2001.

==Administrative divisions==
The Plzeň Region is divided into 7 districts ():
The districts still exist as regional units though most administration has been shifted to the Municipalities with Extended Competence and the Municipalities with Commissioned Local Authority.

===Municipalities with Extended Competence===
Since 1 January 2003, the region has been divided into 15 &quot;Municipalities with Extended Competence&quot; which took over most of the administration of the former District Authorities. Some of these are further divided into Municipalities with Commissioned Local Authority (in brackets):

* Blovice (Spálené Poříčí)
* Domažlice (Kdyně)
* Horažďovice
* Horšovský Týn (Staňkov)
* Kralovice (Manětín, Plasy)
* Klatovy (Nýrsko, Plánice)
* Nepomuk
* Nýřany (Město Touškov, Všeruby, Třemošná)
* Plzeň (Starý Plzenec)
* Přeštice
* Rokycany (Radnice, Zbiroh)
* Stod (Dobřany, Holýšov)
* Stříbro (Bezdružice)
* Sušice (Kašperské Hory)
* Tachov (Bor, Planá u Mariánských Lázní)
==Population==

As of 1 January 2019, the total population of the region was 584,672 inhabitants. Almost 30% of the inhabitants reside in Plzeň which is the fourth largest city in the Czech Republic with 172 thousand inhabitants. There are 56 towns in the region, which account for 67% of the total population. More than 33% of the population lives in municipalities with less than 2,000 inhabitants.

The Plzeň Region is the third least densely populated region in the Czech Republic. The population density is 75.6 inhabitants per km2 while the national average is 135 inhabitants per km2. The least populated part of the region is Tachov District (39 inhabitants per km2). The average age of the population in the region was 42.7 in 2019.

===Cities and towns===
The table shows the most populated cities and towns in the region (as of 1 January 2024):
==Geography==

In the south-eastern part of the region there is a range of Bohemian Forest mountains. The capital Plzeň is surrounded by Plzeň Basin. The rest of the region is occupied by highlands, namely Plzeň Highlands and Brdy Highlands. The largest part of the region belongs to the drainage basin of Berounka river. The southern part of the region belongs to the drainage basin of Otava River.

The agricultural land covers 50.2% of the total area of the region, where 67.9% is arable land. Forests cover 39.7% of the total region&#x27;s area, with higher proportions of forests can be found especially in Šumava, Brdy Highlands and the Bohemian Forest.

There are raw material resources on the region&#x27;s territory, such as coal, heat-resistant and ceramic clays, and building stone limestone. The conditions for farming are quite favourable as well.

The climate of the region is influenced by the western and south-western winds from the Atlantic Ocean, which bring the largest part of the regional precipitation. The climate varies considerably within the region.

==Economy==

Plzeň Region is average in economic development when compared to the rest of the Czech Republic. In 2021, the region produced 4.87% of the national GDP. The region&#x27;s total GDP was CZK 297.919 billion (EUR 12.4 billion) and per capita GDP was CZK 504,354 which was the fourth highest regional result out of fourteen. The most significant sectors in the region are engineering, food processing, building materials industry, ceramics industry, energy production and metallurgy. In 2010 there were 207,000 people employed in the region, accounting for 36% of the total population. In 2011, the business sector in the Plzeň Region comprised 147,000 entities, the majority of which were sole traders. 40% of all economic subjects were based in Plzeň area. The average wage in the region in September 2013 was CZK 23,105 (approximately EUR 905). Compared to other Czech regions, the Plzeň Region has a relatively low level of unemployment (6.07% as of September 2013).
The most significant engineering company in the region is supposedly Škoda Machine Tool a.s. producing for example milling and boring machines, centre lathes, turntables, etc. Other important industrial companies are DIOSS Nýřany a.s. (accumulators and batteries), Okula Nýrsko a.s. (processing of plastics) and Lasselsberger s.r.o (ceramics industry). A number of foreign investors based their establishments in the region in the recent decades, namely Panasonic AVC Networks Czech s.r.o. (flat screen displays production), Yazaki Wiring Technologies Czech s.r.o (components for automobile industry), Vishay Electronic s.r.o. (production of electric components), Borgers Cs spol. s.r.o. (plastic products), etc.

Among important food processing companies of the region belong:
* Pilsner Urquell Brewery (Czech: &quot;Plzeňský Prazdroj a.s.&quot;), which was established in 1843 and is the largest Czech beer exporter;
* Stock Plzeň a.s., the largest Czech producer of liquors;
* Bohemia Sekt Českomoravská vinařská a.s., an important Czech producer of wines, based in Starý Plzenec

The road network of the region consists of 5,129 km of road, whereof 109 km are motorways. The main motorway in the region is the D5 motorway connecting Plzeň with Prague and Germany. As of 1 January 2011 there was 711 km of railways.

==Environment==
Compared to the rest of the Czech Republic, the quality of the environment may be regarded as good. Specific emissions in the region are lower than the national average. The least damaged areas comprise the mountainous parts of Šumava, the Bohemian Forest, western parts of Brdy Highlands, and the areas surrounding the municipalities of Manětín and Nečtiny. The protection of the environment in Šumava has been ensured by the establishment of Šumava National Park and the Šumava Landscape Protected Area. In 2005, the Protected Landscape Area Bohemian Forest was newly designated. There are 182 small protected areas in the Region and several wildlife parks have been
designated to conserve the landscape variability.

On the other hand, the environment is severely damaged in Plzeň. Specific emissions reported for the Plzeň-City District are several times above the national average. Plzeň and its surroundings suffer from heavy road traffic and high concentration of industrial activities. The traffic worsens quality of the environment by emissions (nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons) and noise. Moreover, the areas surrounding the municipalities Nýřany, Tlučná, Vejprnice, Břasy, Radnice, Stříbro and Ejpovice were affected by mining or quarrying activities.

==Cross-border cooperation==
Since 1993, Domažlice District, Klatovy District and Tachov District have been using the European support programme of the cross-border cooperation. The municipalities in the border areas of the Czech Republic and Germany form two Euroregions: the Bohemian Forest- the Bavarian Forest–Mühlveiertel and Egrensis. Cross-border co-operation with Bavaria on the Euroregional basis helps moderate social-economic differences.

==Tourism and culture==
The region is attractive for tourists. Plzeň offers many historical landmarks and natural points of interest. Tourists are also attracted by a dense network of recreation and hiking trails, zoological and botanical gardens in Plzeň and hills in its surroundings – Krkavec, Chlum and Sylván with observation towers.
Other places of interest in the region are (in alphabetical order):
* the remains of Buben, Libštejn and Radyně Gothic castles and Rabštejn nad Střelou castle;
* Horšovský Týn with its Renaissance chateau;
* Kaceřov Renaissance chateau;
* Kašperk Castle;
* Kladruby monastery;
* Kozel chateau;
* Lužany chateau;
* Manětín baroque chateau;
* Nebílovy baroque chateau;
* Plasy Monastery;
* The water castle at Švihov.
* The Black tower and the old town in Klatovy.
Also the town of Domažlice and its traditional summer Chod Festival attract attention of many visitors.

<doc id="681890" wikidata="Q24255789" url="?curid=681890" title="Judgment in Berlin">
<text>Judgment in Berlin is a 1984 book by federal judge Herbert Jay Stern about a hijacking trial in the United States Court for Berlin in 1979, over which he presided.

From the end of World War II in Europe in May 1945 until the reunification of Germany in October 1990, Berlin was divided into four sectors: the American Sector, the French Sector, the British Sector, and the Soviet Sector, each named after the occupying power. The Soviet sector, informally called East Berlin, was considered by East Germany, then a member of the Warsaw Pact, to be part of its territory and in fact its capital, and the American, French, and British Sectors, collectively called West Berlin, were in some respects governed as if they were a part of West Germany, a member of NATO. Seldom did the American government exercise power directly in the American sector, except as it affected American military forces stationed in Berlin. In particular, the judgeship of the United States Court for Berlin was vacant except during the trial over which Judge Stern presided.

In 1978, after prodigious diplomatic efforts, NATO had convinced the Warsaw Pact states to sign an international convention on hijacking, in which each signatory state promised to punish hijackers who landed in their territory.

On 30 August 1978, Hans Detlef Alexander Tiede and Ingrid Ruske, both East Germans, used a starting pistol (not an actual gun) to hijack a Polish passenger aircraft (LOT Polish Airlines Flight 165) from Gdańsk bound for East Berlin&#x27;s Schönefeld Airport and diverted it instead to the U.S. Air Force base at Tempelhof Airport in West Berlin. The West German government was very reluctant to prosecute Tiede and Ruske because of the West German policy of supporting the right of East Germans to flee oppression in the GDR. However, the NATO members did not want to lose the hijacking treaty on which they had worked for so long. Consequently, the case was prosecuted in the never-before-convened United States Court for Berlin.

Over the prosecutor&#x27;s objections, Judge Stern ruled that the defendants were entitled to be tried by a jury, a procedure abolished in Germany in 1924. The case against Tiede&#x27;s co-defendant Ingrid Ruske was dismissed because she had not been notified of her Miranda rights before signing a confession. The jury found Tiede guilty of hostage-taking, but not guilty of acts against the safety of civil aviation, deprivation of liberty and battery. He was sentenced to time served — about nine months.

A significant subtext in the book is Stern&#x27;s refusal to accept assertions made by representatives of the United States Department of State that, as the authority appointing the judge for the United States Court for Berlin, it also had the right to control the judge&#x27;s decision, i.e., tell Stern what to decide. The &quot;time served&quot; sentence, writes Stern, was the only method by which he could protect Tiede from the State Department. Not surprisingly, the State Department and the U.S. Mission to Berlin had a different view of the facts and circumstances.

In 1988, Stern&#x27;s book was used as the basis for a film of the same name that starred Martin Sheen as Judge Stern, Harris Yulin as Bruno Ristau, and Sean Penn as Witness X.

<text>Komodo ( ) is one of the 17,508 islands that comprise the Republic of Indonesia. It is particularly notable as the habitat of the Komodo dragon, the largest lizard on Earth, which is named after the island. Komodo Island has a surface area of 291 square kilometres, and had a human population of about 1,800 in 2020.

Komodo is part of the Lesser Sunda chain of islands and forms part of the Komodo National Park. It is a popular destination for diving. Administratively, it is part of the Komodo District (which also includes Rinca Island and numerous other islands off the west coast of Flores, together with part of the western portion of Flores itself), forming part of West Manggarai Regency within the province of East Nusa Tenggara.

In 1991 Komodo island was include on the Komodo National Park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a Man and Biosphere Reserve. It is considered one of the world&#x27;s 25 biodiversity hotspots. It has also has been selected as one of the New 7 Wonders of Nature. The waters surrounding Komodo island contain rich marine biodiversity. Komodo islands is also a part of the Coral Triangle, which contains some of the richest marine biodiversity on Earth.

It is also a WWF Global 200 Marine Eco-region, a WWF/IUCN Centre of Plant Diversity, one of the world’s Endemic Bird Areas and an ASEAN Heritage Park.

==Description==
Komodo is part of the Lesser Sunda chain of islands and forms part of the Komodo National Park. It lies between the substantially larger neighbouring islands Sumbawa to the west and Flores to the east. The island&#x27;s surface area covers 291 square kilometres. Komodo Island is home to the Komodo Dragon, the largest lizard on earth.

==History==
The earliest stories (among Westerners) of a dragon-like animal existing in the region circulated widely and attracted considerable attention. But no Westerner visited the island to check the story until official interest was sparked in the early 1910s by stories from Dutch sailors based in Flores in East Nusa Tenggara about a mysterious creature. The creature was allegedly a dragon which inhabited a small island in the Lesser Sunda Islands (the main island of which is Flores).
Hearing the reports, Lieutenant Steyn van Hensbroek, an official of the Dutch Colonial Administration in Flores, planned a trip to Komodo Island to continue the search. He armed himself, and accompanied by a team of soldiers, landed on the island. After a few days, Hensbroek managed to kill one of the lizards to investigate.

Realising the significance of the dragons on Komodo Island as an endangered species, the Dutch government issued a regulation on the protection of the lizards on Komodo Island in 1915.

In the decades since the Komodo became known to non-locals, various scientific expeditions from a range of countries have carried out field research on the dragons on Komodo Island.

==People==
Komodo had a population of about 1,800 at the 2020 census, spread out over the island and in the main Komodo village. The native population, the Komodo people, has been extinct since the 1980s. The island&#x27;s present-day residents are descendants of former convicts who were exiled to Komodo and who have mixed with Bugis from Sulawesi. The population is primarily adherents of Islam but there are also Christian and Hindu congregations.

==Ecology==
Komodo is part of the Lesser Sundas deciduous forests ecoregion. The island is also a popular destination for diving and it has been included into the controversial New 7 Wonders of Nature list since November 11, 2011.

===Fauna===

The Komodo dragon, the world&#x27;s largest living lizard, takes its name from the island. A type of monitor lizard, it inhabits Komodo Island and some of the smaller surrounding islands, as well as part of western Flores. Javan deer also inhabit the island, though they are not native. Other animals include water buffalo, banded pigs, civets, cockatoos and macaques.

===Pink beach===

Komodo contains a beach with &quot;pink&quot; sand, one of only seven in the world. The sand appears pink because it is a mixture of white sand and red sand, formed from pieces of Foraminifera.

===2020 closure===

In April 2019, Indonesian authorities announced a plan to close Komodo Island to tourism for a limited period to allow for conservation efforts amid concerns over animal-smuggling. In July 2019, it was confirmed that the island would be closed from the beginning of 2020. In September 2019, the park attracted further controversy when tourists complained that their guides were encouraging them to take selfies with Komodo dragons. The Governor of Nusa Tenggara Timur province, Viktor Laiskodat, said that a budget of Rp 100 billion (around $US 7.2 million) would be provided to support the conservation program. The plan is controversial: Governor Laiskodat has suggested that an expensive entrance fee be charged to foreign tourists while local villagers who live on Komodo Island are worried about the possible loss of income.

<text>Dennis Murphy (January 19, 1934 – November 29, 2010) was a composer, musician, instrument maker, artist, and playwright.

Dennis Murphy was one of the fathers of American gamelan (along with William Colvig). Lou Harrison credits Murphy as being the first North American to build gamelan instruments. He composed numerous works and shadow plays for gamelan.

Starting around 1959 or 1960, while earning a master&#x27;s degree in theory and composition at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in Madison, Murphy got interested in gamelan during a survey course which included a section on ethnomusicology. He heard a recording of Javanese gamelan and was hooked. About that time, the head of the economics department, L. Reed Tripp, returned from Java where he had been on a Ford Foundation grant. While in Indonesia, Tripp&#x27;s two young sons became involved with a children&#x27;s gamelan group. The boys loved it so much that their parents bought a small slendro gamelan and shipped it to their home in Madison. Then Mrs. Tripp called Bob Crane, a composition professor, and asked if he knew anyone who would like to try Javanese Gamelan. So Crane, Murphy and his wife Pat, and few more people started learning what the children could show them, and it went from there.

Shortly after this, Murphy began constructing gamelan instruments and started composing short pieces for gamelan at the same time. The whole story is described in &quot;The Autochthonous American Gamelan&quot;, Murphy&#x27;s thesis written while working towards his PhD in ethnomusicology from Wesleyan University in Connecticut. He named the gamelan &quot;Venerable Sir Voice of Thoom&quot; and invented an entire cosmology and artificial language to go with it (Thoomese).

Murphy started teaching at Goddard College in Plainfield, Vermont in the fall 1967. A student group using Murphy&#x27;s instruments had its first performance the same year. More instruments were made with occasional student help. Instruments were hammered out of steel, or made from found objects such as a car hubcap, soup cans, or an antique milk-strainer. For a couple of years there were nine people in the ensemble (three were named Dennis.) The Goddard Gamelan performed traditional Javanese gamelan pieces along with pieces composed by Murphy and students. By the mid seventies the ensemble had grown to full complement of instruments tuned in both pelog and slendro. Students designed and constructed a building to house the instruments for rehearsals and performances.

In 1980, Goddard made major cuts to its academic programs, and the gamelan moved to the Plainfield Community Center and was renamed the Plainfield Village Gamelan. Later, the ensemble moved to Murphy&#x27;s farm in Plainfield where the group continued to perform. In later years, Murphy was a faculty member with the Vermont Governor&#x27;s Institute on the Arts.

Several of Murphy&#x27;s students have become instrument makers. Barbara Benary while not a student of Murphy made a gamelan following directions in Murphy&#x27;s thesis, and then went on to make more instruments of her own design, notably giant bar-and-resonator gongs, using one-gallon paint cans to build the tubes.

Murphy also composed pieces of chamber and choral music. He performed with the Fyre &amp; Lightning Consort and the Nisht Geferlach Klezmer Band. He also wrote a number of plays which might be loosely categorized with the Theatre of the Absurd, among them &quot;The Goat Painter&quot; and &quot;The Half-Moon Window&quot;. Many of the words and phrases in these plays, such as &quot;Rug Sand,&quot; &quot;Office Oil,&quot; and Hospital Ice,&quot; were taken from the page headers from the local Yellow Pages. He was a vegetarian and did not wear anything made from animal products, preferring a rope belt and flip-flops in all kinds of weather.

String theory, a leading candidate for a quantum theory of gravity, uses it to describe exotic phenomena such as T-duality and other geometric dualities, mirror symmetry, topology-changing transitions, minimal possible distance scale, and other effects that challenge intuition. More technically, quantum geometry refers to the shape of a spacetime manifold as experienced by D-branes, which includes quantum corrections to the metric tensor, such as the worldsheet instantons. For example, the quantum volume of a cycle is computed from the mass of a brane wrapped on this cycle.

In an alternative approach to quantum gravity called loop quantum gravity (LQG), the phrase &quot;quantum geometry&quot; usually refers to the formalism within LQG where the observables that capture the information about the geometry are well-defined operators on a Hilbert space. In particular, certain physical observables, such as the area, have a discrete spectrum. LQG is non-commutative.

It is possible (but considered unlikely) that this strictly quantized understanding of geometry is consistent with the quantum picture of geometry arising from string theory.

Another approach, which tries to reconstruct the geometry of space-time from &quot;first principles&quot; is Discrete Lorentzian quantum gravity.

==Quantum states as differential forms==

Differential forms are used to express quantum states, using the wedge product:

:formula_1

where the position vector is

:formula_2

the differential volume element is

:formula_3

and are an arbitrary set of coordinates, the upper indices indicate contravariance, lower indices indicate covariance, so explicitly the quantum state in differential form is:

:formula_4

The overlap integral is given by:

:formula_5

in differential form this is

:formula_6

The probability of finding the particle in some region of space is given by the integral over that region:

:formula_7

provided the wave function is normalized. When is all of 3d position space, the integral must be if the particle exists.

Differential forms are an approach for describing the geometry of curves and surfaces in a coordinate independent way. In quantum mechanics, idealized situations occur in rectangular Cartesian coordinates, such as the potential well, particle in a box, quantum harmonic oscillator, and more realistic approximations in spherical polar coordinates such as electrons in atoms and molecules. For generality, a formalism which can be used in any coordinate system is useful.

<text>A neuromuscular junction (or myoneural junction) is a chemical synapse between a motor neuron and a muscle fiber.

It allows the motor neuron to transmit a signal to the muscle fiber, causing muscle contraction.

Muscles require innervation to function—and even just to maintain muscle tone, avoiding atrophy. In the neuromuscular system, nerves from the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system are linked and work together with muscles. Synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction begins when an action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal of a motor neuron, which activates voltage-gated calcium channels to allow calcium ions to enter the neuron. Calcium ions bind to sensor proteins (synaptotagmins) on synaptic vesicles, triggering vesicle fusion with the cell membrane and subsequent neurotransmitter release from the motor neuron into the synaptic cleft. In vertebrates, motor neurons release acetylcholine (ACh), a small molecule neurotransmitter, which diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on the cell membrane of the muscle fiber, also known as the sarcolemma. nAChRs are ionotropic receptors, meaning they serve as ligand-gated ion channels. The binding of ACh to the receptor can depolarize the muscle fiber, causing a cascade that eventually results in muscle contraction.

Neuromuscular junction diseases can be of genetic and autoimmune origin. Genetic disorders, such as Congenital myasthenic syndrome, can arise from mutated structural proteins that comprise the neuromuscular junction, whereas autoimmune diseases, such as myasthenia gravis, occur when antibodies are produced against nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the sarcolemma.

==Structure and function==

===Quantal transmission===

At the neuromuscular junction, presynaptic motor axons terminate 30 nanometers from the cell membrane or sarcolemma of a muscle fiber. The sarcolemma at the junction has invaginations called postjunctional folds, which increase its surface area facing the synaptic cleft. These postjunctional folds form the motor endplate, which is studded with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at a density of 10,000 receptors/μm2. The presynaptic axons terminate in bulges called terminal boutons (or presynaptic terminals) that project toward the postjunctional folds of the sarcolemma. In the frog each motor nerve terminal contains about 300,000 vesicles, with an average diameter of 0.05 micrometers. The vesicles contain acetylcholine. Some of these vesicles are gathered into groups of fifty, positioned at active zones close to the nerve membrane. Active zones are about 1 micrometer apart.
The 30 nanometer cleft between nerve ending and endplate contains a meshwork of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) at a density of 2,600 enzyme molecules/μm2, held in place by the structural proteins dystrophin and rapsyn. Also present is the receptor tyrosine kinase protein MuSK, a signaling protein involved in the development of the neuromuscular junction, which is also held in place by rapsyn.

About once every second in a resting junction randomly one of the synaptic vesicles fuses with the presynaptic neuron&#x27;s cell membrane in a process mediated by SNARE proteins. Fusion results in the emptying of the vesicle&#x27;s contents of 7000–10,000 acetylcholine molecules into the synaptic cleft, a process known as exocytosis. Consequently, exocytosis releases acetylcholine in packets that are called quanta. The acetylcholine quantum diffuses through the acetylcholinesterase meshwork, where the high local transmitter concentration occupies all of the binding sites on the enzyme in its path. The acetylcholine that reaches the endplate activates ~2,000 acetylcholine receptors, opening their ion channels which permits sodium ions to move into the endplate producing a depolarization of ~0.5 mV known as a miniature endplate potential (MEPP). By the time the acetylcholine is released from the receptors the acetylcholinesterase has destroyed its bound ACh, which takes about ~0.16 ms, and hence is available to destroy the ACh released from the receptors.

When the motor nerve is stimulated there is a delay of only 0.5 to 0.8 msec between the arrival of the nerve impulse in the motor nerve terminals and the first response of the endplate The arrival of the motor nerve action potential at the presynaptic neuron terminal opens voltage-dependent calcium channels, and Ca2+ ions flow from the extracellular fluid into the presynaptic neuron&#x27;s cytosol. This influx of Ca2+ causes several hundred neurotransmitter-containing vesicles to fuse with the presynaptic neuron&#x27;s cell membrane through SNARE proteins to release their acetylcholine quanta by exocytosis. The endplate depolarization by the released acetylcholine is called an endplate potential (EPP). The EPP is accomplished when ACh binds the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) at the motor end plate, and causes an influx of sodium ions. This influx of sodium ions generates the EPP (depolarization), and triggers an action potential that travels along the sarcolemma and into the muscle fiber via the T-tubules (transverse tubules) by means of voltage-gated sodium channels. The conduction of action potentials along the T-tubules stimulates the opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels which are mechanically coupled to Ca2+ release channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The Ca2+ then diffuses out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum to the myofibrils so it can stimulate contraction. The endplate potential is thus responsible for setting up an action potential in the muscle fiber which triggers muscle contraction. The transmission from nerve to muscle is so rapid because each quantum of acetylcholine reaches the endplate in millimolar concentrations, high enough to combine with a receptor with a low affinity, which then swiftly releases the bound transmitter.

===Acetylcholine receptors===

Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter synthesized from dietary choline and acetyl-CoA (ACoA), and is involved in the stimulation of muscle tissue in vertebrates as well as in some invertebrate animals. In vertebrates, the acetylcholine receptor subtype that is found at the neuromuscular junction of skeletal muscles is the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), which is a ligand-gated ion channel. Each subunit of this receptor has a characteristic &quot;cys-loop&quot;, which is composed of a cysteine residue followed by 13 amino acid residues and another cysteine residue. The two cysteine residues form a disulfide linkage which results in the &quot;cys-loop&quot; receptor that is capable of binding acetylcholine and other ligands. These cys-loop receptors are found only in eukaryotes, but prokaryotes possess ACh receptors with similar properties. Not all species use a cholinergic neuromuscular junction; e.g. crayfish and fruit flies have a glutamatergic neuromuscular junction.

AChRs at the skeletal neuromuscular junction form heteropentamers composed of two α, one β, one ɛ, and one δ subunits. When a single ACh ligand binds to one of the α subunits of the ACh receptor it induces a conformational change at the interface with the second AChR α subunit. This conformational change results in the increased affinity of the second α subunit for a second ACh ligand. AChRs, therefore, exhibit a sigmoidal dissociation curve due to this cooperative binding. The presence of the inactive, intermediate receptor structure with a single-bound ligand keeps ACh in the synapse that might otherwise be lost by cholinesterase hydrolysis or diffusion. The persistence of these ACh ligands in the synapse can cause a prolonged post-synaptic response.

==Development==
The development of the neuromuscular junction requires signaling from both the motor neuron&#x27;s terminal and the muscle cell&#x27;s central region. During development, muscle cells produce acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) and express them in the central regions in a process called prepatterning. Agrin, a heparin proteoglycan, and MuSK kinase are thought to help stabilize the accumulation of AChR in the central regions of the myocyte. MuSK is a receptor tyrosine kinase—meaning that it induces cellular signaling by binding phosphate molecules to self regions like tyrosines, and to other targets in the cytoplasm. Upon activation by its ligand agrin, MuSK signals via two proteins called &quot;Dok-7&quot; and &quot;rapsyn&quot;, to induce &quot;clustering&quot; of acetylcholine receptors. ACh release by developing motor neurons produces postsynaptic potentials in the muscle cell that positively reinforces the localization and stabilization of the developing neuromuscular junction.

These findings were demonstrated in part by mouse &quot;knockout&quot; studies. In mice which are deficient for either agrin or MuSK, the neuromuscular junction does not form. Further, mice deficient in Dok-7 did not form either acetylcholine receptor clusters or neuromuscular synapses.

The development of neuromuscular junctions is mostly studied in model organisms, such as rodents. In addition, in 2015 an all-human neuromuscular junction has been created in vitro using human embryonic stem cells and somatic muscle stem cells. In this model presynaptic motor neurons are activated by optogenetics and in response synaptically connected muscle fibers twitch upon light stimulation.

==Research methods==

José del Castillo and Bernard Katz used ionophoresis to determine the location and density of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at the neuromuscular junction. With this technique, a microelectrode was placed inside the motor endplate of the muscle fiber, and a micropipette filled with acetylcholine (ACh) was placed directly in front of the endplate in the synaptic cleft. A positive voltage was applied to the tip of the micropipette, which caused a burst of positively charged ACh molecules to be released from the pipette. These ligands flowed into the space representing the synaptic cleft and bound to AChRs. The intracellular microelectrode monitored the amplitude of the depolarization of the motor endplate in response to ACh binding to nicotinic (ionotropic) receptors. Katz and del Castillo showed that the amplitude of the depolarization (excitatory postsynaptic potential) depended on the proximity of the micropipette releasing the ACh ions to the endplate. The farther the micropipette was from the motor endplate, the smaller the depolarization was in the muscle fiber. This allowed the researchers to determine that the nicotinic receptors were localized to the motor endplate in high density.

Toxins are also used to determine the location of acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. α-Bungarotoxin is a toxin found in the snake species Bungarus multicinctus that acts as an ACh antagonist and binds to AChRs irreversibly. By coupling assayable enzymes such as horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or fluorescent proteins such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the α-bungarotoxin, AChRs can be visualized and quantified.

==Toxins that affect the neuromuscular junction==

===Nerve gases===
Nerve gases bind to and phosphorylate AChE, effectively deactivating them. The accumulation of ACh within the synaptic cleft causes muscle cells to be perpetually contracted, leading to severe complications such as paralysis and death within minutes of exposure.
=== Botulinum toxin ===
Botulinum toxin (also known as botulinum neurotoxin, and commercially sold under the trade name Botox) inhibits the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction by interfering with SNARE proteins. This toxin crosses into the nerve terminal through the process of endocytosis and subsequently cleaves SNARE proteins, preventing the ACh vesicles from fusing with the intracellular membrane. This induces a transient flaccid paralysis and chemical denervation localized to the striated muscle that it has affected. The inhibition of ACh release does not set in until approximately two weeks after the injection is made. Three months after the inhibition occurs, neuronal activity begins to regain partial function, and six months after, complete neuronal function is regained.

===Tetanus toxin===
Tetanus toxin, also known as tetanospasmin is a potent neurotoxin produced by &quot;Clostridium tetani&quot; and causes the disease state, tetanus. The LD50 of this toxin has been measured to be approximately 1 ng/kg, making it second only to botulinum toxin D as the deadliest toxin in the world. It functions very similarly to botulinum neurotoxin by attaching and endocytosing into the presynaptic nerve terminal and interfering with SNARE proteins. It differs from botulinum neurotoxin in a few ways, most apparently in its end state, wherein tetanospasmin causes spastic paralysis as opposed to the flaccid paralysis demonstrated with botulinum neurotoxin.

===Latrotoxin===
Latrotoxin (α-Latrotoxin) found in venom of widow spiders also affects the neuromuscular junction by causing the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic cell. Mechanisms of action include binding to receptors on the presynaptic cell activating the IP3/DAG pathway and release of calcium from intracellular stores and pore formation resulting in influx of calcium ions directly. Either mechanism causes increased calcium in presynaptic cell, which then leads to release of synaptic vesicles of acetylcholine. Latrotoxin causes pain, muscle contraction and if untreated potentially paralysis and death.

===Snake venom===
Snake venoms act as toxins at the neuromuscular junction and can induce weakness and paralysis. Venoms can act as both presynaptic and postsynaptic neurotoxins.

Presynaptic neurotoxins, commonly known as β-neurotoxins, affect the presynaptic regions of the neuromuscular junction. The majority of these neurotoxins act by inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine, into the synapse between neurons. However, some of these toxins have also been known to enhance neurotransmitter release. Those that inhibit neurotransmitter release create a neuromuscular blockade that prevents signaling molecules from reaching their postsynaptic target receptors. In doing so, the victim of these snake bite suffer from profound weakness. Such neurotoxins do not respond well to anti-venoms. After one hour of inoculation of these toxins, including notexin and taipoxin, many of the affected nerve terminals show signs of irreversible physical damage, leaving them devoid of any synaptic vesicles.

Postsynaptic neurotoxins, otherwise known as α-neurotoxins, act oppositely to the presynaptic neurotoxins by binding to the postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors. This prevents interaction between the acetylcholine released by the presynaptic terminal and the receptors on the postsynaptic cell. In effect, the opening of sodium channels associated with these acetylcholine receptors is prohibited, resulting in a neuromuscular blockade, similar to the effects seen due to presynaptic neurotoxins. This causes paralysis in the muscles involved in the affected junctions. Unlike presynaptic neurotoxins, postsynaptic toxins are more easily affected by anti-venoms, which accelerate the dissociation of the toxin from the receptors, ultimately causing a reversal of paralysis. These neurotoxins experimentally and qualitatively aid in the study of acetylcholine receptor density and turnover, as well as in studies observing the direction of antibodies toward the affected acetylcholine receptors in patients diagnosed with myasthenia gravis.

==Diseases==

Any disorder that compromises the synaptic transmission between a motor neuron and a muscle cell is categorized under the umbrella term of neuromuscular diseases. These disorders can be inherited or acquired and can vary in their severity and mortality. In general, most of these disorders tend to be caused by mutations or autoimmune disorders. Autoimmune disorders, in the case of neuromuscular diseases, tend to be humoral mediated, B cell mediated, and result in an antibody improperly created against a motor neuron or muscle fiber protein that interferes with synaptic transmission or signaling.

===Autoimmune===

====Myasthenia gravis====
Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder where the body makes antibodies against either the acetylcholine receptor (AchR) (in 80% of cases), or against postsynaptic muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) (0–10% of cases). In seronegative myasthenia gravis low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 is targeted by IgG1, which acts as a competitive inhibitor of its ligand, preventing the ligand from binding its receptor. It is not known if seronegative myasthenia gravis will respond to standard therapies.

=====Neonatal MG=====
Neonatal MG is an autoimmune disorder that affects 1 in 8 children born to mothers who have been diagnosed with myasthenia gravis (MG). MG can be transferred from the mother to the fetus by the movement of AChR antibodies through the placenta. Signs of this disease at birth include weakness, which responds to anticholinesterase medications, as well as fetal akinesia, or the lack of fetal movement. This form of the disease is transient, lasting for about three months. However, in some cases, neonatal MG can lead to other health effects, such as arthrogryposis and even fetal death. These conditions are thought to be initiated when maternal AChR antibodies are directed to the fetal AChR and can last until the 33rd week of gestation, when the γ subunit of AChR is replaced by the ε subunit. 

====Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome====
Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune disorder that affects the presynaptic portion of the neuromuscular junction. This rare disease can be marked by a unique triad of symptoms: proximal muscle weakness, autonomic dysfunction, and areflexia. Proximal muscle weakness is a product of pathogenic autoantibodies directed against P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels, which in turn leads to a reduction of acetylcholine release from motor nerve terminals on the presynaptic cell. Examples of autonomic dysfunction caused by LEMS include erectile dysfunction in men, constipation, and, most commonly, dry mouth. Less common dysfunctions include dry eyes and altered perspiration. Areflexia is a condition in which tendon reflexes are reduced and it may subside temporarily after a period of exercise.

50–60% of the patients that are diagnosed with LEMS also have present an associated tumor, which is typically small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). This type of tumor also expresses voltage-gated calcium channels. Oftentimes, LEMS also occurs alongside myasthenia gravis.

Treatment for LEMS consists of using 3,4-diaminopyridine as a first measure, which serves to increase the compound muscle action potential as well as muscle strength by lengthening the time that voltage-gated calcium channels remain open after blocking voltage-gated potassium channels. In the US, treatment with 3,4-diaminopyridine for eligible LEMS patients is available at no cost under an expanded access program. Further treatment includes the use of prednisone and azathioprine in the event that 3,4-diaminopyridine does not aid in treatment.

====Neuromyotonia====
Neuromyotonia (NMT), otherwise known as Isaac&#x27;s syndrome, is unlike many other diseases present at the neuromuscular junction. Rather than causing muscle weakness, NMT leads to the hyperexcitation of motor nerves. NMT causes this hyperexcitation by producing longer depolarizations by down-regulating voltage-gated potassium channels, which causes greater neurotransmitter release and repetitive firing. This increase in rate of firing leads to more active transmission and as a result, greater muscular activity in the affected individual. NMT is also believed to be of autoimmune origin due to its associations with autoimmune symptoms in the individual affected.

===Genetic===

====Congenital myasthenic syndromes====
Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are very similar to both MG and LEMS in their functions, but the primary difference between CMS and those diseases is that CMS is of genetic origins. Specifically, these syndromes are diseases incurred due to mutations, typically recessive, in 1 of at least 10 genes that affect presynaptic, synaptic, and postsynaptic proteins in the neuromuscular junction. Such mutations usually arise in the ε-subunit of AChR, thereby affecting the kinetics and expression of the receptor itself. Single nucleotide substitutions or deletions may cause loss of function in the subunit. Other mutations, such as those affecting acetylcholinesterase and acetyltransferase, can also cause the expression of CMS, with the latter being associated specifically with episodic apnea. These syndromes can present themselves at different times within the life of an individual. They may arise during the fetal phase, causing fetal akinesia, or the perinatal period, during which certain conditions, such as arthrogryposis, ptosis, hypotonia, ophthalmoplegia, and feeding or breathing difficulties, may be observed. They could also activate during adolescence or adult years, causing the individual to develop slow-channel syndrome.

Treatment for particular subtypes of CMS (postsynaptic fast-channel CMS) is similar to treatment for other neuromuscular disorders. 3,4-Diaminopyridine, the first-line treatment for LEMS, is under development as an orphan drug for CMS in the US, and available to eligible patients under an expanded access program at no cost.

<text>Highway 24, also known as the Little Fort Highway or the Interlakes Highway, is a east-west connection between the Cariboo Highway, just south of 100 Mile House, and the Southern Yellowhead Highway at Little Fort. It practically provides a &quot;second-chance&quot; route to travellers heading east from Vancouver who missed the route to the northern part of the province or toward Edmonton.

Although a rural gravel road did exist between 93 Mile House and Little Fort previously, construction under the Highway 24 name on the modern route did not begin until 1974. A dirt highway was open by 1977. Paving and auxiliary feature installation was complete by 1981.

==Route description==

Highway 24 straddles the boundary between the Cariboo and Thompson-Nicola Regional Districts. It begins in the west at 93 Mile House, approximately south of 100 Mile House. After , it passes through the small community of Lone Butte. After passing several turn-offs to resort lakes including Sheridan Lake, the highway passes through the community of Bridge Lake, later. The highway then proceeds another east through the forest and over a large hill before reaching its terminus in Little Fort.

A very scenic drive, the highway follows a historic trail used by the Shuswap people as a trade route and was later developed by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in the early 19th century to bring furs from northern BC out to Fort Kamloops and the Columbia River.

<text>Songs from the Superunknown is an EP by the American rock band Soundgarden. It was released on November 21, 1995, through A&amp;M Records. It was released on the same day as the CD-ROM &quot;Alive in the Superunknown&quot;.

==Overview==
The EP is the audio-only counterpart to &quot;Alive in the Superunknown&quot;. AllMusic staff writer Greg Prato gave the EP two and a half out of five stars. He called it a &quot;solid (albeit short) collection of Soundgarden outtakes&quot;.

==Alive in the Superunknown==
The CD-ROM &quot;Alive in the Superunknown&quot; contains the first four tracks from &quot;Songs from the Superunknown&quot; plus a multimedia portion featuring photos of the band, a video game, four music videos (&quot;The Day I Tried to Live&quot;, &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot;, &quot;My Wave&quot;, and &quot;Fell on Black Days&quot;), a performance/special effects video of &quot;Superunknown&quot;, and a live video of &quot;Kickstand&quot;, among other things. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said, &quot;Nothing on &quot;Alive&quot; ... equals the mystery, humor, sonic impact, or imagination contained on any one of the tracks on Soundgarden&#x27;s &quot;Superunknown&quot; album.&quot;

<text>The Air Defence of Great Britain (ADGB) was a Royal Air Force (RAF) command comprising substantial army and RAF elements responsible for the air defence of the British Isles. It lasted from 1925, following recommendations that the RAF take control of metropolitan air defence, until 1936 when it became RAF Fighter Command.

==History==
The ADGB was created as a command in 1925 as a result of the 1923 recommendation of the Steel–Bartholomew Committee, including their recommendation to transfer responsibility for home air defence from the War Office to the Air Ministry. It main initial elements were:
* The RAF&#x27;s Metropolitan Air Force, initially comprising 25 squadrons (9 fighter), soon expanding to 52 squadrons (17 fighter)
* 264 heavy AA guns (Royal Artillery) and 672 searchlights (Royal Engineers)
* The new part-time volunteer Observer Corps

ADGB was organised into three defensive zones:
* Inner Artillery Zone (IAZ), over London.
* Air Fighter Zone (AFZ), divided into two areas controlling regular squadrons, the Wessex Bombing Area and the Fighting Area.
* Outer Artillery Zone (OAZ), a narrow belt along the coast from Suffolk to Sussex.

In 1936, ADGB was abolished; the Bombing Area becoming Bomber Command and the Fighting Area becoming Fighter Command and remaining responsible for the ADGB function. The OAZ was abolished and the AFZ expanded. The guns from the OAZ were used for port and base defence and were added to the London defences. The changing threat meant that AA defences were needed for many more potential targets in the British Isles, notably industries important for war production. The AA component became the 1st Anti-Aircraft Division and in 1937 the 2nd Anti-Aircraft Division was formed to defend the Midlands, with Anti-Aircraft Command created to replace the previous Army arrangements.

In 1937, light AA guns were added, the RAF&#x27;s view that small-calibre artillery were unsuitable having been finally overturned. In 1940, searchlights were transferred from the Royal Engineers to the Royal Artillery. Unrotated Projectile (rocket) batteries were deployed at the beginning of the war. At its peak from 1941–1942, AA Command comprised I, II and III Anti-Aircraft Corps with twelve AA divisions, comprising several hundred regiments. GOC-in-C AA Command for most of the war was General Sir Frederick Pile, the equal in rank of his &#x27;superior&#x27; AOC-in-C Fighter Command.

;1943

ADGB was resurrected in 1943 for the rump of Fighter Command defending the United Kingdom after the formation of the RAF Second Tactical Air Force in 1943 and AA Command. It was Fighter Command in all but name, and this was finally reflected in 1944 with a return to the previous name.

<text>b2evolution is a content and community management system written in PHP and backed by a MySQL database. It is distributed as free software under the GNU General Public License.

b2evolution originally started as a multi-user multi-blog engine when François Planque forked b2evolution from version 0.6.1 of b2/cafelog in 2003. A more widely known fork of b2/cafelog is WordPress. b2evolution is available in web host control panels as a &quot;one click install&quot; web app.

Most of the early major releases were named after famous cities or particular places the project maintainer has visited and/or was inspired by.

After version 5.0, the project began to emphasize online community and online marketing features and integration with social networking sites, with the ability to automatically post new content to Twitter. To highlight the software&#x27;s ability to manage many types of content, its blogs were renamed to &quot;collections&quot;.

b2evolution 5.0 was rapidly adopted, becoming the most popular version, but overall b2evolution usage is declining relative to competitors WordPress and Drupal. Currently, it is installed on less than 0.1% of websites.

== Main features ==
Known primarily for its multi-blog capabilities, b2evolution also includes &quot;all the features of traditional blog tools&quot; like file &amp; photo management, advanced skinning, multiple domain support, detailed user permissions, and W3C standards compliance. It installs on almost any LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL/MariaDB, PHP) server. The software will run on IIS using FastCGI, but database servers other than MySQL and MariaDB are not supported. Configuration is handled through the installer or administrative back-end.

In addition to its ability to manage multiple blogs, b2evolution supports multiple users and admins under a single installation without the need of external plugins. b2evolution also supports numerous third-party plugins. These include text format extensions enabling Textile, Auto-P, Greymatter, BB code, Texturize, LaTeX, and graphic smilies. Also, plugins which facilitate full integration with third party tools such as Gallery 2, YouTube, and digg are available.

Other features include community-wide spam filters, in which many b2evolution sites aggregate and tag spammer IPs into a central blacklist for the benefit of all b2evolution blogs, a button to declare &quot;comment spam bankruptcy&quot;—which deletes all comments across an entire b2evolution installation, a fully skinnable interface, strong SEO features including automatic redirection of renamed articles and insertion of canonical link tags, url shortening, localization into a dozen language packs, and a fully exposed API for plugin developers to add new functionality. b2evolution&#x27;s code is factored into the blog application itself and a framework called EvoCore. EvoCore can be used on its own to build non-blog web applications.

<text>The Confederation of Brazilian Football (; CBF) is the governing body of football in Brazil. It was founded on Monday, 8 June 1914, as , and renamed Confederação Brasileira de Desportos in 1916. The football confederation, as known today, separated from other sports associations on 24 September 1979. 

The CBF has its headquarters in Rio de Janeiro. The confederation owns a training center, named Granja Comary, located in Teresópolis.

It was announced on 29 September 2007, that the CBF would launch a women&#x27;s league and cup competition in October 2007 following pressure from FIFA president Sepp Blatter during the 2007 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup in China.

<doc id="681927" wikidata="Q2979919" url="?curid=681927" title="Diogenes Club">
<text>The Diogenes Club is a fictional gentlemen&#x27;s club created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and featured in several Sherlock Holmes stories, such as 1893&#x27;s &quot;The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter&quot;. It seems to have been named after Diogenes the Cynic (though this is never explained in the original stories) and was co-founded by Sherlock&#x27;s indolent elder brother Mycroft Holmes.

The club as described by Sherlock Holmes in &quot;The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter&quot;:

&quot;There are many men in London, you know, who, some from shyness, some from misanthropy, have no wish for the company of their fellows. Yet they are not averse to comfortable chairs and the latest periodicals. It is for the convenience of these that the Diogenes Club was started, and it now contains the most unsociable and unclubbable men in town. No member is permitted to take the least notice of any other one. Save in the Stranger&#x27;s Room, no talking is, under any circumstances, allowed, and three offences, if brought to the notice of the committee, render the talker liable to expulsion. My brother was one of the founders, and I have myself found it a very soothing atmosphere.&quot;

==Relation to British Secret Service==
Although there is no hint in the original Sherlock Holmes canon that the Diogenes Club is anything but what it seems to be, several later writers developed and used the idea that the club was founded as a front for the British Secret Service. This may have its root in &quot;The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans&quot; (1908), in which Mycroft Holmes is revealed to be the supreme and indispensable brain-trust behind the British government, who pieces together collective government secrets and offers advice on the best way to act.

The idea was popularised by &quot;The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a 1970 motion picture directed by Billy Wilder, and has since been frequently used in pastiches of Conan Doyle&#x27;s stories as well as the TV series &quot;Sherlock&quot;.

The Diogenes Club has appeared, in various forms, in many other settings, most of which take as given the Club&#x27;s connection to the British Secret Service:

* The Diogenes Club was featured in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; 1994 Virgin New Adventures novel &quot;All-Consuming Fire&quot;, a &quot;Doctor Who&quot;/Sherlock Holmes crossover novel, which also refers to Kim Newman&#x27;s character Charles Beauregard. A 2008 follow-up to this, in Big Finish&#x27;s &quot;Bernice Summerfield&quot; series of audio adventures, is &quot;The Adventure of the Diogenes Damsel&quot;.
* Also in 2011, the club was mentioned in Guy Ritchie&#x27;s movie &quot;Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows&quot;, when Watson made a deduction about Mycroft prior to the stag party.
* The club also appears in Nicholas Meyer&#x27;s 1974 novel &quot;The Seven-Per-Cent Solution&quot;, Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier&quot; graphic novel, the computer game &quot;Sherlock Holmes: Case of the Rose Tattoo&quot;, the Dark Horse Comics comic &quot;Predator: Nemesis&quot;, and in the short story &quot;Closing Time&quot; from Neil Gaiman&#x27;s collection of short fiction &quot;Fragile Things&quot;. It is also featured in the Japanese manga &quot;Embalming -The Another Tale of Frankenstein-&quot;, where one of the club&#x27;s founder&#x27;s uses the alias &quot;Mike Roft&quot;, a play on Mycroft, and remarks that &quot;if you are looking for someone, my younger brother is quite good at that type of thing&quot;.
*&quot;Anno Dracula&quot; by Kim Newman features both the Diogenes Club and Mycroft Holmes. The Diogenes Club is again a headquarters of the secret decision-makers of the British government, with several members of board present—diminishing as the novel progresses—but Mycroft&#x27;s words carrying the most authority. Its commitment to utter silence within its walls is portrayed as really being a high-security measure.
* In Philip José Farmer&#x27;s Wold Newton Universe, specifically &quot;The Other Log of Phileas Fogg&quot;, it is stated that the real Diogenes Club was the Athenaeum Club, but that Arthur Conan Doyle changed the name for his stories.
* In the BBC TV series &quot;Sherlock&quot; episode &quot;The Reichenbach Fall&quot;, the Diogenes Club is shown; Watson goes there, desperate to see Mycroft Holmes, gets into trouble for talking, and is briskly and not too gently escorted to the Stranger&#x27;s Room by two muffle-shoed bouncers who hold a white gloved hand over his mouth to prevent his continued speaking. Furthermore, the club is also shown in the 2016 episode of &quot;Sherlock&quot; &quot;The Abominable Bride&quot; set in the Victorian Era. In this adaptation, the silent nature of the club stems from a desire to prevent the accidental leaking of state secrets by the members as, according to Mycroft, they all share one tea lady. 
* In the CBS TV series &quot;Elementary&quot;, Mycroft is a restaurateur who owns a gourmet international restaurant chain called Diogenes.
* In the BBC TV series &quot;My Family&quot; episode &quot;Sitting Targets&quot;, the final scene shows character Michael Harper receiving a trophy for outwitting his father at a Diogenes Club meeting.
* In the ABC TV series &quot;Forever&quot;, episode &quot;Hitler on the Half Shell&quot;, Dr. Henry Morgan learns that The Morgan Trading Company has ties to the slave trade in the West Indies while meeting friends at the Diogenes Club in 1812.
* The club itself, as well as Sherlock&#x27;s description of it nearly verbatim (but translated into Japanese) is featured in Volume 3, Chapter 11 of Nobuhiro Watsuki&#x27;s manga &quot;Embalming&quot;.
* The Diogenes Club is also the name of a British alternative pop band.
* In 1932 a group of naturists founded The Diogenes Sun Club.

<doc id="681931" wikidata="Q1884921" url="?curid=681931" title="Lady in the Lake">
<text>Lady in the Lake is a 1947 American film noir starring Robert Montgomery, Audrey Totter, Lloyd Nolan, Tom Tully, Leon Ames and Jayne Meadows. An adaptation of the 1943 Raymond Chandler murder mystery &quot;The Lady in the Lake&quot;, the picture was also Montgomery&#x27;s directorial debut, and last in either capacity for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) after eighteen years with the studio. Montgomery&#x27;s use of point-of-view cinematography and its failure was blamed for the end of his career at MGM.

As director, Montgomery&#x27;s ambition was to create a cinematic version of the first-person narrative style of Chandler&#x27;s Philip Marlowe novels. With the exception of a pair each of reflections in a mirror and direct addresses to the audience in character Marlowe is never seen: the balance of the film is shot from the point of view of the central character, seeing only what he does. MGM promoted the film with the claim that it was the first of its kind and the most revolutionary style of film since the introduction of the talkies. The movie was also unusual for having virtually no instrumental soundtrack, employing a wordless vocal chorus in lieu.

The film did not use the 195-page screenplay adaptation Chandler penned for MGM in 1945. Instead, a 125-page version written by Steve Fisher was filmed two years later. The script changes the novel&#x27;s midsummer setting to December, frequently using cheery Christmas themes as an ironic counterpoint to grim aspects of the story. The opening credits appear on a stack of Christmas cards, the last of which reveals a handgun.

==Plot==
Tired of the low pay of his profession, hard-boiled Los Angeles private detective Phillip Marlowe submits a murder story to Kingsby Publications. He is invited to the publisher&#x27;s offices to discuss his work, but soon realizes it is merely a ploy. A few days before Christmas, publishing executive Adrienne Fromsett hires him to locate Chrystal Kingsby, the wife of her boss, Derace Kingsby. One month earlier, Kingsby’s wife had sent her husband a telegram saying she was heading to Mexico to divorce him and marry a man named Chris Lavery. But, according to Fromsett, Lavery says he has not seen Chrystal for two months, and the telegram appears to be fake. It becomes obvious to Marlowe that Fromsett wants her boss for herself.

Marlowe goes to see Lavery, who claims to know nothing about any trip to Mexico. Lavery, however, says that Mrs. Kingsby was a beautiful woman before revising it to &quot;is.&quot; He sucker-punches the detective, and Marlowe wakes up in jail. He is questioned by Captain Kane and a belligerent Lieutenant DeGarmot. Marlowe refuses to divulge anything, and Kane releases him.

Marlowe learns that a woman&#x27;s body has been recovered from a lake on property which Kingsby owns, and that Kingsby&#x27;s caretaker, Mr. Chess, was charged with the murder of his wife Muriel. Fromsett suspects that Chrystal is the real killer, as she and Muriel hated each other. Little Fawn Lake was also where Chrystal was last seen. Marlowe learns that Muriel was an alias for a woman named Mildred Havelend and that she was hiding from a tough cop, whose description fits DeGarmot.

Marlowe goes to see Lavery again. Inside the unlocked house, he encounters Lavery&#x27;s landlady, Mrs. Fallbrook, holding a gun she claims to have just found. Upstairs, he finds Lavery dead, shot several times. He also finds a handkerchief with the monogram &quot;A F&quot;.

Before calling the police, Marlowe goes to the publishing house to confront Fromsett, interrupting a Christmas party. In private, she denies killing Lavery. Kingsby, learning that Fromsett had hired Marlowe to find Chrystal, tells her theirs will be strictly a business relationship from now on. A furious Fromsett fires the private eye, but Kingsby immediately hires him to find his wife.

Marlowe informs the police of Lavery&#x27;s death. At the scene, he suggests that Muriel was hiding from DeGarmot. DeGarmot slaps Marlowe, and the two men scuffle. Kane takes Marlowe into custody, releasing him only out of Christmas spirit.

Marlowe obtains more information on Muriel from a newspaper contact. She had been a suspect in the suspicious death of her previous employer&#x27;s wife. The investigating detective, DeGarmot, ruled that death a suicide; the victim&#x27;s parents strongly disagreed. Marlowe finds the parents have been intimidated into silence. His car is then run off the road by DeGarmot. Regaining consciousness after the crash, Marlowe gets to a pay phone and calls Fromsett for help. She takes him to her apartment, where she claims that she has fallen in love with him. They spend Christmas Day together while he recovers from his injuries.

Kingsby receives a phone call from his wife, asking for money and, unable to find Marlowe, goes to Fromsett&#x27;s apartment to ask her if she has seen the detective. Marlowe agrees to give Kingsby&#x27;s money to Chrystal, as Kingsby is being followed by police detectives. Placing his trust in Fromsett, Marlowe instructs her to have the police trail him, following a trail of rice he will leave.

The woman Marlowe meets turns out to be Mildred Havelend, alias the &quot;landlord&quot; Mrs. Fallbrook, alias Muriel. She killed Chrystal – the &quot;lady in the lake&quot; of the title – in addition to her former employer&#x27;s wife and Lavery. DeGarmot was in love with Havelend and helped her cover up the first murder. Then she fled from him and married Chess.

Havelend pulls a gun on Marlowe in her apartment. DeGarmot tracks them down, having overheard Fromsett speaking to Captain Kane and following Marlowe&#x27;s trail of rice. He plans to kill them both with Havelend&#x27;s gun and stage it to look like she and Marlowe shot each other. DeGarmot then shoots a pleading Mildred several times. Kane arrives just in time to gun down his own crooked cop, saving Marlowe.

==Cast==
* Robert Montgomery as Phillip Marlowe (&quot;Phillip&quot; spelled with two &quot;l&quot;s, rather than with one)
* Audrey Totter as Adrienne Fromsett
* Lloyd Nolan as Lt. DeGarmot
* Tom Tully as Capt. Kane
* Leon Ames as Derace Kingsby
* Jayne Meadows as Muriel, aka Mildred Havelend, aka Mrs. Fallbrook
* Dick Simmons as Chris Lavery
* Morris Ankrum as Eugene Grayson
* Lila Leeds as Receptionist
* William Roberts as Artist
* Kathleen Lockhart as Mrs. Grayson

The &quot;actress&quot; credited as playing Chrystal Kingsby, &quot;Ellay Mort&quot;, is an inside joke, as the character is never seen in the film. The name is a homonym of the French &quot;elle est morte,&quot; meaning &quot;she is dead&quot;.

==Production==
Montgomery had stood in as director for John Ford on &quot;They Were Expendable&quot; when Ford got sick, and he wanted to direct again. He convinced MGM to buy the rights to Chandler&#x27;s latest novel, &quot;The Lady in the Lake&quot;, for which the studio paid a reported $35,000. Since Chandler had co-written the screenplay for &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; with Billy Wilder, for which he received an Academy Award nomination, and then had received another nomination for his script for &quot;The Blue Dahlia&quot;, Montgomery wanted Chandler to write the screenplay for &quot;Lady in the Lake&quot;. This resulted in the 195-page screenplay which has been called &quot;remarkably bad&quot;. Montgomery then brought in Steve Fisher to completely re-write the screenplay. (Chandler and Fisher had both been writers for &quot;Black Mask&quot; magazine in the 1930s.) Fisher made major changes, such as re-setting the time of the film to the Christmas holiday, and dropping all the scenes which took place at the lake. Chandler objected to these changes, and was insulted that another writer was changing his story, but he still insisted that he be given a screenplay credit, until he saw the final result, when he demanded that his name be removed from the film.
Montgomery tried a technique that had often been talked about in Hollywood but never used in a major film: he used the camera as the protagonist of the film. Other characters talk directly to the camera. The voice of Marlowe is that of Montgomery, but his face is shown only in reflections. MGM objected to Montgomery&#x27;s first-person idea, since it meant that the star of the film would only be seen infrequently; so the studio insisted that Montgomery film a prologue where Marlowe, in his office, explains what was happening; the setting was returned to briefly several times during the film, and at the end. Various techniques had to be devised to make the subjective camera look realistic. For instance, in order to simulate the protagonist walking, John Arnold, executive head of photography at MGM, developed a new kind of camera dolly, with four independent wheels, allowing the dolly to walk through doors and up stairs. A seat was also attached to the front of the dolly for Montgomery to sit in, so that the actors could see and play off of him as filming took place. For the fight scenes, Paul C. Vogel, the director of photography, used a modified Eyemo camera with a flexible shoulder harness.

==Box office==
According to MGM records the film earned $1,812,000 in the US and Canada and $845,000 elsewhere resulting in a profit of $598,000.

==Reception and legacy==
Reviews of the film were not appreciative of the new approach. Most critics gave the director credit for trying an experimental technique but felt that it was a &quot;gimmick&quot;, and that the experiment had been a failure. Author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film two and a half out of four stars, commending its first person perspective storytelling, but criticized its confusing plot and dated presentation.

The film has a 60% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

The film was later cited as an inspiration for the first-person perspective visual style of RaMell Ross&#x27; film adaptation of &quot;Nickel Boys&quot; (2024).

===Radio adaptation===
&quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot; presented a 60-minute radio adaptation of the movie on February 9, 1948, with Montgomery and Totter reprising their roles. A recording of the production is available as a streaming audio.

<text>The National Three Peaks Challenge is an event in which participants attempt to climb the highest mountains of England, Scotland and Wales within 24 hours. It is frequently used to raise money for charitable organisations. Walkers climb each peak in turn, and are driven from the foot of one mountain to the next. The three peaks are:
*Ben Nevis / &quot; (), the highest mountain in Scotland
*Scafell Pike (), the highest mountain in England
*Snowdon / &quot; (), the highest mountain in Wales
The total distance walked is estimated at or , with a total ascent of .

==Ben Nevis==
Ben Nevis () is the highest mountain in the British Isles. It is located at the western end of the Grampian Mountains in the Lochaber area of the Scottish Highlands, close to the town of Fort William. It attracts an estimated 100,000 ascents a year, around three-quarters of which are made using the Pony Track from Glen Nevis on the south side of the mountain. For climbers and mountaineers the main attraction lies in the high cliffs of the north face; among the highest cliffs in the United Kingdom, they harbour some classic scrambles and rock climbs of all difficulties, and are one of the principal locations in the UK for ice climbing.

The summit, at above sea level, features the ruins of an observatory, which was continuously staffed between 1883 and 1904. The meteorological data collected during this period is still important for understanding Scottish mountain weather. Charles Thomson Rees Wilson was inspired to invent the cloud chamber after a period spent working at the observatory, for which he was joint winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1927.

==Scafell Pike==
Scafell Pike is the highest mountain in England at . It is located in Lake District National Park, in Cumbria.

Scafell Pike consists of igneous rock dating from the Ordovician geologically part of the Borrowdale Volcanics. The summit plateau of Scafell Pike, and that of other neighbouring peaks, is covered with shattered rock debris which provides the highest altitude example of a summit boulder field in England. The boulder field is thought to have been caused in part by weathering, such as frost action. Additional factors are also considered to be important, however opinion varies as to what these may be. Clifton Ward suggested that weathering with earthquakes as a secondary agent could be responsible, while J. E. Marr and R. A. Daly believed that earthquakes were unnecessary and suggested that frost action with other unspecified agents was more likely. To the north of the summit are a number of high altitude ghylls or ravines, containing streams which flow into Lingmell Beck. These are good examples in Cumbria for this type of stream, and are also biologically important due to their species richness.

==Snowdon==
Snowdon () is the highest mountain in Wales, at an altitude of above sea level, and the highest point in the British Isles outside Scotland. It is located in Snowdonia National Park (&quot;&quot;) in Gwynedd, and has been described as &quot;probably the busiest mountain in Britain&quot;. It is designated as a national nature reserve for its rare flora and fauna.

The rocks that form Snowdon were produced by volcanoes in the Ordovician period, and the massif has been extensively sculpted by glaciation, forming the pyramidal peak of Snowdon and the arêtes of Crib Goch and Y Lliwedd. The cliff faces on Snowdon, including Clogwyn Du&#x27;r Arddu, are significant for rock climbing, and the mountain was used by Edmund Hillary in training for the 1953 ascent of Mount Everest.

Snowdon affords some of the best views in Britain, and the summit can be reached by a number of well-known paths. The summit can also be reached on the Snowdon Mountain Railway, a rack and pinion railway opened in 1896 which carries passengers the from Llanberis to the summit station. The summit also houses a visitor centre called &quot;&quot;, opened in 2009 to replace one built in the 1930s.

The name &quot;Snowdon&quot; is from the Old English for &quot;snow hill&quot;, while the Welsh name – &#x27; – means &quot;the tumulus&quot;, which may refer to the cairn thrown over the legendary giant Rhitta Gawr after his defeat by King Arthur. As well as other figures from Arthurian legend, the mountain is linked to a legendary &#x27; (water monster) and the (fairies).

==Logistics==
Ronald Turnbull argues that it makes sense to tackle the summits from north to south, starting at Ben Nevis in the evening, and ending at Snowdon the following day. This is because the descent of Ben Nevis is the easiest of the three to do in fading light, particularly the lower section below Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe (&quot;Half-Way Lochan&quot;), and because the night can be used for driving down the A74(M) and M74 motorways to Scafell Pike. This then entails climbing Scafell Pike early the following morning and driving to Snowdonia for the early afternoon, in order to climb Snowdon and descend again by the evening. Scafell Pike can be climbed either from the north side starting at Seathwaite (Borrowdale) or from the south side, starting at Wasdale Head. The Wasdale approach is a longer drive but provides a shorter walk. Snowdon is climbed from Pen-y-Pass, although an alternative descent leads to Llanberis, and takes an additional 15 minutes.

Each mountain is expected to take up to 5 hours to climb and descend for a &quot;standard strong walker&quot;, and a total driving time of 10 hours allows an average speed of on motorways and on trunk roads and occasional comfort breaks and fuel stops.

Variations of the basic format have also been achieved, such as replacing the driving sections with the use of public transport, or sailing between the three peaks across the Irish Sea.

==Environmental impact==

There is some controversy about the environmental impact of the Three Peaks Challenge. In an editorial in the British Mountaineering Council&#x27;s &quot;Summit&quot; magazine, Jill Hudson argues that the Three Peaks Challenge should be shunned as it costs charities more to clean up after participants than they raise by taking part. In 2011, &quot;Wanderlust&quot; magazine placed the challenge on a list of destinations in need of greater care, and that the numbers of participants should be limited. Organisers disagree, arguing that the 30,000 participants in the Three Peaks Challenge is small compared to the 250,000 who climb Snowdon annually. Since March 2010, the Fundraising Standards Board has acted as a centralised hub for complaints from the National Parks about groups engaged in the National Three Peaks Challenge.

<text>Stein am Rhein (abbreviated as Stein a. R.) is a historic town and a municipality in the canton of Schaffhausen in Switzerland.

The town&#x27;s medieval centre retains the ancient street plan. The site of the city wall, and the city gates are preserved, though the former city wall now consists of houses. The medieval part of the town has been pedestrianised and many of the medieval buildings are painted with frescoes.

== History ==


In or around 1007 Emperor Henry II moved St George&#x27;s Abbey from its former location on the Hohentwiel in Singen to Stein am Rhein, at that time little more than a small fishing village on the Rhine. This was in order to strengthen his presence at this strategic point where major road and river routes intersected. He gave the abbots extensive rights over Stein and its trade so that they could develop it commercially. In this they were very successful, and Stein am Rhein rapidly became a prosperous town which in the 15th century was briefly granted &quot;reichsfrei&quot; status.

The Imperial abbey also prospered and in the 15th century completely rebuilt its premises, which remain as a significant example of late Gothic architecture in the region.

Under the Reformation, the abbey was secularised and its assets taken over by Zürich. Abbot von Winkelsheim negotiated a settlement with the Zürich authorities, whereby, although control of the abbey was handed over to them, he and the remaining monks would be allowed to remain on the premises until their deaths. However, Zürich suspected the abbot of collusion with the Habsburgs and locked him up in his new rooms. He was able to escape to Radolfzell, but died shortly after, in 1526.

On February 22, 1945, the town was bombed by the United States Air Force.

==Coat of arms==
The blazon of the municipal coat of arms is &quot;Gules St. George armoured Azure mulleted, haired and haloed Or riding a Horse Argent to sinister holding in sinister an escutcheon Argent cross Gules and in dexter a lance Or killing a Dragon Vert.&quot; This is a reference to the monastery of St. George in the town.

<doc id="681962" wikidata="Q1193095" url="?curid=681962" title="Coupling constant">
<text>In physics, a coupling constant or gauge coupling parameter (or, more simply, a coupling), is a number that determines the strength of the force exerted in an interaction. Originally, the coupling constant related the force acting between two static bodies to the &quot;charges&quot; of the bodies (i.e. the electric charge for electrostatic and the mass for Newtonian gravity) divided by the distance squared, formula_1, between the bodies; thus: formula_2 in formula_3 for Newtonian gravity and formula_4 in formula_5 for electrostatic. This description remains valid in modern physics for linear theories with static bodies and massless force carriers.

A modern and more general definition uses the Lagrangian formula_6 (or equivalently the Hamiltonian formula_7) of a system. Usually, formula_6 (or formula_7) of a system describing an interaction can be separated into a &quot;kinetic part&quot; formula_10 and an &quot;interaction part&quot; formula_11: formula_12 (or formula_13).
In field theory, formula_11 always contains 3 fields terms or more, expressing for example that an initial electron (field 1) interacts with a photon (field 2) producing the final state of the electron (field 3). In contrast, the &quot;kinetic part&quot; formula_10 always contains only two fields, expressing the free propagation of an initial particle (field 1) into a later state (field 2).
The coupling constant determines the magnitude of the formula_10 part with respect to the formula_11 part (or between two sectors of the interaction part if several fields that couple differently are present). For example, the electric charge of a particle is a coupling constant that characterizes an interaction with two charge-carrying fields and one photon field (hence the common Feynman diagram with two arrows and one wavy line). Since photons mediate the electromagnetic force, this coupling determines how strongly electrons feel such a force, and has its value fixed by experiment. By looking at the QED Lagrangian, one sees that indeed, the coupling sets the proportionality between the kinetic term formula_18 and the interaction term formula_19.

A coupling plays an important role in dynamics. For example, one often sets up hierarchies of approximation based on the importance of various coupling constants. In the motion of a large lump of magnetized iron, the magnetic forces may be more important than the gravitational forces because of the relative magnitudes of the coupling constants. However, in classical mechanics, one usually makes these decisions directly by comparing forces. Another important example of the central role played by coupling constants is that they are the expansion parameters for first-principle calculations based on perturbation theory, which is the main method of calculation in many branches of physics.

== Fine-structure constant ==
Couplings arise naturally in a quantum field theory. A special role is played in relativistic quantum theories by couplings that are dimensionless; i.e., are pure numbers. An example of such a dimensionless constant is the fine-structure constant,
: formula_20
where is the charge of an electron, is the permittivity of free space, is the reduced Planck constant and is the speed of light. This constant is proportional to the square of the coupling strength of the charge of an electron to the electromagnetic field.

== Gauge coupling ==
In a non-abelian gauge theory, the gauge coupling parameter, formula_21, appears in the Lagrangian as
: formula_22
(where G is the gauge field tensor) in some conventions. In another widely used convention, G is rescaled so that the coefficient of the kinetic term is 1/4 and formula_21 appears in the covariant derivative. This should be understood to be similar to a dimensionless version of the elementary charge defined as
: formula_24

== Weak and strong coupling ==
In a quantum field theory with a coupling &quot;g&quot;, if &quot;g&quot; is much less than 1, the theory is said to be &quot;weakly coupled&quot;. In this case, it is well described by an expansion in powers of &quot;g&quot;, called perturbation theory. If the coupling constant is of order one or larger, the theory is said to be &quot;strongly coupled&quot;. An example of the latter is the hadronic theory of strong interactions (which is why it is called strong in the first place). In such a case, non-perturbative methods need to be used to investigate the theory.

In quantum field theory, the dimension of the coupling plays an important role in the renormalizability property of the theory, and therefore on the applicability of perturbation theory. If the coupling is dimensionless in the natural units system (i.e. formula_25, formula_26), like in QED, QCD, and the weak interaction, the theory is renormalizable and all the terms of the expansion series are finite (after renormalization). If the coupling is dimensionful, as e.g. in gravity (formula_27), the Fermi theory (formula_28) or the chiral perturbation theory of the strong force (formula_29), then the theory is usually not renormalizable. Perturbation expansions in the coupling might still be feasible, albeit within limitations, as most of the higher order terms of the series will be infinite.

== Running coupling ==

One may probe a quantum field theory at short times or distances by changing the wavelength or momentum, k, of the probe used. With a high frequency (i.e., short time) probe, one sees virtual particles taking part in every process. This apparent violation of the conservation of energy may be understood heuristically by examining the uncertainty relation
: formula_30
which virtually allows such violations at short times.
The foregoing remark only applies to some formulations of quantum field theory, in particular, canonical quantization in the interaction picture.

In other formulations, the same event is described by &quot;virtual&quot; particles going off the mass shell. Such processes renormalize the coupling and make it dependent on the energy scale, &quot;μ&quot;, at which one probes the coupling. The dependence of a coupling &quot;g&quot;(&quot;μ&quot;) on the energy-scale is known as &quot;running of the coupling&quot;. The theory of the running of couplings is given by the renormalization group, though it should be kept in mind that the renormalization group is a more general concept describing any sort of scale variation in a physical system (see the full article for details).

=== Phenomenology of the running of a coupling ===
The renormalization group provides a formal way to derive the running of a coupling, yet the phenomenology underlying that running can be understood intuitively. As explained in the introduction, the coupling &quot;constant&quot; sets the magnitude of a force which behaves with distance as formula_31. The formula_31-dependence was first explained by Faraday as the decrease of the force flux: at a point &quot;B&quot; distant by formula_33 from the body &quot;A&quot; generating a force, this one is proportional to the field flux going through an elementary surface &quot;S&quot; perpendicular to the line &quot;AB&quot;. As the flux spreads uniformly through space, it decreases according to the solid angle sustaining the surface &quot;S&quot;. In the modern view of quantum field theory, the formula_31 comes from the expression in position space of the propagator of the force carriers. For relatively weakly-interacting bodies, as is generally the case in electromagnetism or gravity or the nuclear interactions at short distances, the exchange of a single force carrier is a good first approximation of the interaction between the bodies, and classically the interaction will obey a formula_31-law (note that if the force carrier is massive, there is an additional formula_33 dependence). When the interactions are more intense (e.g. the charges or masses are larger, or formula_33 is smaller) or happens over briefer time spans (smaller formula_33), more force carriers are involved or particle pairs are created, see Fig. 1, resulting in the break-down of the formula_31 behavior. The classical equivalent is that the field flux does not propagate freely in space any more but e.g. undergoes screening from the charges of the extra virtual particles, or interactions between these virtual particles. It is convenient to separate the first-order formula_31 law from this extra formula_33-dependence. This latter is then accounted for by being included in the coupling, which then becomes formula_42-dependent, (or equivalently &quot;μ&quot;-dependent). Since the additional particles involved beyond the single force carrier approximation are always virtual, i.e. transient quantum field fluctuations, one understands why the running of a coupling is a genuine quantum and relativistic phenomenon, namely an effect of the high-order Feynman diagrams on the strength of the force.

Since a running coupling effectively accounts for microscopic quantum effects, it is often called an &quot;effective coupling&quot;, in contrast to the &quot;bare coupling (constant)&quot; present in the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian.

=== Beta functions ===

In quantum field theory, a &quot;beta function&quot;, &quot;β&quot;(&quot;g&quot;), encodes the running of a coupling parameter, &quot;g&quot;. It is defined by the relation
: formula_43
where &quot;μ&quot; is the energy scale of the given physical process. If the beta functions of a quantum field theory vanish, then the theory is scale-invariant.

The coupling parameters of a quantum field theory can flow even if the corresponding classical field theory is scale-invariant. In this case, the non-zero beta function tells us that the classical scale-invariance is anomalous.

=== QED and the Landau pole ===
If a beta function is positive, the corresponding coupling increases with increasing energy. An example is quantum electrodynamics (QED), where one finds by using perturbation theory that the beta function is positive. In particular, at low energies, , whereas at the scale of the Z boson, about 90 GeV, one measures .

Moreover, the perturbative beta function tells us that the coupling continues to increase, and QED becomes &quot;strongly coupled&quot; at high energy. In fact the coupling apparently becomes infinite at some finite energy. This phenomenon was first noted by Lev Landau, and is called the Landau pole. However, one cannot expect the perturbative beta function to give accurate results at strong coupling, and so it is likely that the Landau pole is an artifact of applying perturbation theory in a situation where it is no longer valid. The true scaling behaviour of formula_44 at large energies is not known.

=== QCD and asymptotic freedom ===
In non-abelian gauge theories, the beta function can be negative, as first found by Frank Wilczek, David Politzer and David Gross. An example of this is the beta function for quantum chromodynamics (QCD), and as a result the QCD coupling decreases at high energies.

Furthermore, the coupling decreases logarithmically, a phenomenon known as asymptotic freedom (the discovery of which was awarded with the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2004). The coupling decreases approximately as
: formula_45
where formula_46 is the energy of the process involved and &quot;β&quot;0 is a constant first computed by Wilczek, Gross and Politzer.

Conversely, the coupling increases with decreasing energy. This means that the coupling becomes large at low energies, and one can no longer rely on perturbation theory. Hence, the actual value of the coupling constant is only defined at a given energy scale. In QCD, the Z boson mass scale is typically chosen, providing a value of the strong coupling constant of αs(MZ2 ) = 0.1179 ± 0.0010. In 2023 Atlas measured the most precise so far. The most precise measurements stem from lattice QCD calculations, studies of tau-lepton decay, as well as by the reinterpretation of the transverse momentum spectrum of the Z boson.

=== QCD scale ===
In quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the quantity Λ is called the QCD scale. The value is
formula_47 for three &quot;active&quot; quark flavors, &quot;viz&quot; when the energy–momentum involved in the process allows production of only the up, down and strange quarks, but not the heavier quarks. This corresponds to energies below 1.275 GeV. At higher energy, Λ is smaller, e.g. formula_48 MeV above the bottom quark mass of about 5 GeV. The meaning of the minimal subtraction (MS) scheme scale ΛMS is given in the article on dimensional transmutation. The proton-to-electron mass ratio is primarily determined by the QCD scale.

== String theory ==
A remarkably different situation exists in string theory since it includes a dilaton. An analysis of the string spectrum shows that this field must be present, either in the bosonic string or the NS–NS sector of the superstring. Using vertex operators, it can be seen that exciting this field is equivalent to adding a term to the action where a scalar field couples to the Ricci scalar. This field is therefore an entire function worth of coupling constants. These coupling constants are not pre-determined, adjustable, or universal parameters; they depend on space and time in a way that is determined dynamically. Sources that describe the string coupling as if it were fixed are usually referring to the vacuum expectation value. This is free to have any value in the bosonic theory where there is no superpotential.

<text>Providence is an American medical drama television series that was created by John Masius and ran on NBC from January 8, 1999, to December 20, 2002, airing 96 episodes over the course of five seasons.

==Synopsis==
The show revolves around Dr. Sydney Hansen (Melina Kanakaredes), who leaves her glamorous job as a plastic surgeon for the rich in Beverly Hills so she can return to her hometown of Providence, Rhode Island, and be with her family. Sydney lives with her father Jim (Mike Farrell), brother Robbie (Seth Peterson), sister Joanie (Paula Cale), and Joanie&#x27;s baby Hannah in a large home in suburban Providence that also houses her father&#x27;s veterinary clinic. Sydney&#x27;s mother Lynda (Concetta Tomei) dies in the first episode but continues to appear to Sydney as a spirit, to offer advice.

The show ends rather abruptly, with a two-part wedding episode. NBC called this &quot;Providence&quot; &quot;winter finale,&quot; fully expecting to bring it back in the spring or autumn of 2003, but these plans were eventually scrapped when some cast members, including Melina Kanakaredes, opted out of returning for a sixth season.

==Characters==
===Main===
* Dr. Sydney &quot;Syd&quot; Hansen (Melina Kanakaredes) – A high-profile plastic surgeon who returns home for her sister&#x27;s wedding. Unfortunately, her mother dies before the ceremony begins. Syd returns to Los Angeles, only to find her boyfriend cheating on her with a man. She ultimately decides to move back home to Providence to help her family, and she takes a job at a free clinic that she later ends up running. While struggling with her new specialty of family medicine while helping her family, she tries to rebuild her love life, without much luck until season 5.
* Joan &quot;Joanie&quot; Hansen (Paula Cale) – Sydney&#x27;s younger sister and single mother of young Hannah. Her mother&#x27;s death interrupts her wedding and, after giving birth to Hannah, she decides not to marry Hannah&#x27;s father, Richie. An optimistic woman, Joanie assists her father in his practice until she discovers that her cooking, while unpalatable for humans, is a delicacy for dogs, and she opens a delicatessen bakery for dogs. Her love life, however, is as complicated as her older sister&#x27;s. Though loyal to her family, Joanie often feels overshadowed by Syd&#x27;s accomplishments, and they quibble frequently. Joanie senses that her parents, especially her father, tend to favor Syd, so she decides to take over as her father&#x27;s caregiver after he survives a near-fatal gunshot head wound that was intended for his dog, Fearless. Joanie often makes Syd feel guilty about having her own life and priorities, but as she later learns, it stems from extreme envy. While Joanie admires her sister, she finds herself resenting her sister&#x27;s sense of freedom.
* Robert &quot;Robbie&quot; Hansen (Seth Peterson) – Syd&#x27;s younger brother. A charming bad boy who manages a pub and is a gambling addict. After much trouble, he finally settles down when he marries Tina, a divorced mother of one, Pete, and later has a son with her, Nicholas &quot;Nick&quot; Hansen.
* Lynda Hansen (Concetta Tomei) – Sydney, Joanie, and Robbie&#x27;s overbearing mother. She dies before her pregnant daughter&#x27;s wedding service, and afterwards appears only to Syd in dreams, giving her (often unsolicited) advice.
* Dr. Jim Hansen (Mike Farrell) – Sydney, Joanie, and Robbie&#x27;s father, a warmhearted veterinarian who runs a clinic in his basement and who occasionally relates better to animals than to people.
* Dr. Helen Reynolds (Leslie Silva) – Syd&#x27;s friend and head of the free clinic in Season 1. Afterwards, she returns to her hometown, leaving the clinic in Sydney&#x27;s hands.

===Recurring===
* Kyle Moran (Tom Verica) – Syd&#x27;s old high-school sweetheart.
* Lily Gallagher (Nicki Aycox) – A troubled teenage girl whom Syd took in to provide her with a better life. While getting her life straightened out, she was called on by her drug dealing ex-boyfriend and killed in a car accident during a high-speed police chase.
* Heather Tupperman (Dana Daurey) – Jim&#x27;s assistant in his veterinary clinic.
* Izzy Nunez (Samaria Graham) – Syd&#x27;s physician assistant in the free clinic.
* Burt Ridley (Jon Hamm) – A firefighter who dated Joanie after saving her from a kitchen fire.
* Tina Calcaterra (Maria Pitillo) – The divorced mother of Pete who met Robbie during one of Pete&#x27;s hockey games. She later married Robbie, and she gave birth to a son, Nicholas &quot;Nick&quot; Hansen.
* Pete Calcaterra (Alex D. Linz) – Tina&#x27;s son from a previous marriage who later becomes Robbie&#x27;s stepson.
* Graham Hollings (Alastair Duncan) – A reclusive lighthouse keeper with a badly scarred face whom Syd tends for an injury and later convinces him to undergo plastic surgery to fix his face.
* Dr. Sam Magala (Cress Williams) – A veterinarian who fills for Jim while he recovers from a gunshot injury to his brain.
* Owen Frank (George Newbern) – A lawyer who helped Syd on her malpractice suit. He later began dating Syd, and they got married in the two-part series finale.

<text>Dimension Films was an American independent film and television production and distribution label founded in 1992, and currently owned by independent studio Lantern Entertainment. Formally one of the American &quot;mini-majors&quot; (i.e., small to medium independent television and motion picture production studios), Dimension Films produced and released independent films and genre titles; specifically horror and science fiction films.

Dimension Films was used as Harvey and Bob Weinstein&#x27;s label within the brothers&#x27; own Miramax Films studio, which was acquired by The Walt Disney Company on June 30, 1993. The Weinsteins took the Dimension Films label with them when they separated from Miramax Films on October 1, 2005, and paired it under their new company, The Weinstein Company (TWC). However, the firing of Harvey Weinstein following allegations of sexual harassment and rape against him, as well as financial troubles that followed, led to TWC&#x27;s decline. TWC eventually declared bankruptcy in February 2018, with Lantern acquiring a majority of its film library and assets, and was shut down on July 16, 2018. 

All films released by Dimension Films before 2005 (as part of Miramax) are currently owned and distributed by Paramount Pictures through Paramount Global&#x27;s acquisition of a 49% stake in Miramax that was closed on April 3, 2020.

== History ==
=== 1991–1992: Foundation and early releases ===
Dimension Films was officially founded in 1992 under its parent company Miramax Films by Bob Weinstein as a label to distribute horror films and other films deemed &quot;disreputable&quot; for release under the Miramax Films title. Prior to 1992, the Weinsteins had released similar titles under a smaller operation called Millimeter Films.

The first release under the Dimension Films label was the sequel film &quot;Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth&quot;, released theatrically in the United States in 1992, followed by Stuart Gordon&#x27;s sci-fi thriller &quot;Fortress&quot;, and the sequel &quot;Children of the Corn II: The Final Sacrifice&quot;, both released the same year.

=== 1993–1999: Disney&#x27;s acquisition of Miramax ===
On June 30, 1993, The Walt Disney Company purchased Miramax Films, who had been facing financial troubles between 1990 and 1992, prior to their acquisition and release of &quot;The Crying Game&quot;, which earned the company US$60 million. The success of &quot;The Crying Game&quot; made Miramax Films attractive to Disney, who officially bought the company in 1993, resulting in Dimension Films becoming a Disney subsidiary.

After the box-office failure of &quot;Mother&#x27;s Boys&quot; (1994) starring Jamie Lee Curtis, Dimension Films distributed Miramax Films&#x27; &quot;The Crow&quot; (1994), which would garner Dimension Films its first major commercial success. In 1995, Dimension Films acquired the rights to the &quot;Halloween&quot; film series, releasing the sixth installment &quot;&quot; in September that year. The release of &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot; (1996) would mark the beginning of a working relationship with director Robert Rodriguez as well as a lucrative franchise, with several sequels to follow.

Dimension Films would gain greater exposure with its distribution of Wes Craven&#x27;s &quot;Scream&quot;, released on December 20, 1996, which became a major box office hit, grossing $173 million worldwide. The company also produced and distributed its sequel, &quot;Scream 2&quot;, released the following year, which grossed a comparable $172 million.

Dimension Films continued its trend of releasing horror and science fiction films, specifically films aimed at teenagers and young adult audiences, with the releases of &quot;Phantoms&quot; (1998) and the &quot;Halloween&quot; sequel &quot;Halloween H20: 20 Years Later&quot; (1998), the latter of which garnered the company another commercial success. The company released its second film with director Robert Rodriguez, the teen sci-fi film &quot;The Faculty&quot;, on Christmas Day 1998. In 1999, Dimension Films distributed David Cronenberg&#x27;s &quot;eXistenZ&quot; and Scream-writer Kevin Williamson&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Teaching Mrs. Tingle&quot;.

=== 2000–2004: Post-millennium releases ===
Dimension Films&#x27; first post-millennium release was the direct-to-video &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. Next was &quot;Scream 3&quot; (2000), which was theatrically released like its predecessors. In July 2000, the company released the slasher parody film &quot;Scary Movie&quot;, which grossed a record-breaking $278 million for the company and marked the beginning of another popular film series. 2001 saw the release of the Robert Rodriguez-directed &quot;Spy Kids&quot;, which was the company&#x27;s first major children&#x27;s film. The film would spawn another popular franchise for the company.

Beginning in 2000, Dimension Films began purchasing North American distribution rights to various international productions. Their 2001 release of &quot;The Others&quot;, a Spanish-produced supernatural thriller starring Nicole Kidman, was a surprise success for the company. Other international productions purchased by Dimension Films included two additional horror films by Spanish director Jaume Balagueró: &quot;The Nameless&quot; (1999), and &quot;Darkness&quot; (2002). &quot;Darkness&quot; received a North American theatrical release in December 2004 after being shelved for two years, and proved to be a financial success, while &quot;The Nameless&quot; was released direct-to-video in 2005. In January 2005, Dimension Films purchased the American distribution rights to the Australian horror film &quot;Wolf Creek&quot;, which was released in December that year.

For much of the early 2000s, Dimension Films produced and distributed numerous sequels to films released under their branch, including several direct-to-video releases for films such as &quot;Children of the Corn: Revelation&quot; (2001), &quot;&quot; (2002), and &quot;Dracula III: Legacy&quot; (2005). They also distributed several comedies, such as the Terry Zwigoff-directed &quot;Bad Santa&quot; (2003), and David Zucker&#x27;s &quot;My Boss&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (2003).

=== 2005–2018: Separation from Miramax ===
In 2005, the Weinstein brothers purchased the rights to Dimension Films from Disney, and Dimension Films officially became a subsidiary of The Weinstein Company (TWC), established the same year.

After their separation from Miramax Films, Dimension Films would co-produce several titles with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), including the horror remakes &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; (2005), &quot;Black Christmas&quot; (2006), and &quot;Halloween&quot; (2007), as well as the Stephen King-based thrillers &quot;1408&quot; and &quot;The Mist&quot; (both 2007). In the spring of 2007, Dimension Films produced and distributed the joint-double feature film &quot;Grindhouse&quot;, directed by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. The film was a major box office failure, grossing less than half of its $53 million budget.

In 2011, &quot;Scream 4&quot;, the fourth installment in the &quot;Scream&quot; series, was released and proved to be another box office success in the franchise, earning nearly $100 million in box office receipts. The company released the sci-fi horror films &quot;Apollo 18&quot; (2011) and &quot;Dark Skies&quot; (2013). In 2013, Dimension Films acquired the rights to the independent slasher film &quot;All the Boys Love Mandy Lane&quot;, shot in 2006, and gave the film a limited release in the United States in October.

Dimension partnered with MTV for the television series &quot;Scream&quot;, based on the film series. On June 24, 2019, it was announced that &quot;Scream&quot; would be moving to VH1 ahead of the third season, which Dimension did not produce. Dimension Films also had involvement with One Ball Pictures, who owns the &quot;Funny Or Die&quot; online series. They released their first episode, &quot;A Lesson with John McEnroe&quot;, with Dimension Films.

In 2015, Dimension Films lost the rights to the &quot;Halloween&quot; franchise.

=== Bankruptcy ===
In 2018, TWC was purchased in a bankruptcy auction by Lantern Entertainment. 

On December 20, 2019, ViacomCBS (now known as Paramount Global) announced that they would acquire 49% of Miramax from beIN Media Group for at least $375 million, with Paramount Pictures gaining exclusive worldwide distribution rights to the Miramax library, including the pre-2005 Dimension films. ViacomCBS and Miramax will also co-produce new content based on titles from the Miramax library. The deal closed on April 3, 2020.

== Home media ==
The pre-2005 Dimension films were originally released to home video through Buena Vista Home Entertainment and marketed under the Dimension Home Video label (under the Hollywood Pictures Home Entertainment label in some places), while Miramax was owned by Disney. After Disney sold Miramax to Filmyard in 2010, they were distributed from 2011 to 2020 on home video through Lionsgate Home Entertainment, with Echo Bridge Home Entertainment briefly handling some as well. Through ViacomCBS (now Paramount Global)&#x27;s 49% stake in Miramax, Paramount Home Entertainment acquired the home video distribution rights to the pre-2005 Dimension titles. Notable exceptions are &quot;The Others&quot; (2001), &quot;Mr. 3000&quot; (2004) and the international distribution of &quot;Scary Movie 4&quot; (2006).

As of 2024, the post-2005 Dimension Films titles (apart from &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; (2005), owned by Amazon MGM Studios through Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, as of 2020) are currently released on DVD and Blu-ray by Lionsgate. Before, they were distributed by Genius Products and Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.

=== Dimension Extreme ===
Beginning in 2008, Dimension introduced the Dimension Extreme label, which released primarily international indie horror and teen film/adult comedy (i.e., &quot;Extreme Movie&quot;) titles on DVD.

<text>: &quot;For the concept of safe passage in wartime, see Humanitarian corridor.&quot;
The Safe Corridor initiative is part of an effort by the New Jersey Department of Transportation, and departments from other states, to improve the safety of its roads. Roads with accident and fatality rates above the average may have some of their lengths designated as &quot;Safe Corridor&quot; areas. In these areas, traffic fines are doubled.

At the program&#x27;s inception, there were thirteen roads with Safe Corridors: U.S. Route 1, U.S. Route 9, Route 10, Route 17, U.S. Route 22, Route 23, U.S. Route 30, U.S. Route 40, U.S. Route 46, Route 47, Route 73, U.S. Route 130, and U.S. Route 206.

The Safe Corridors Program is a part of New Jersey&#x27;s &quot;Safety First&quot; initiative, which combines $20 million in highway improvements over five years with stricter police enforcement, increased fines for unsafe equipment and hazardous driving, and enhanced driver education for all motorists. New Jersey&#x27;s Safe Corridors Program focuses on improving safety along the State&#x27;s most crash-prone corridors – nearly of state roadway.

<doc id="682001" wikidata="Q3296863" url="?curid=682001" title="Singlet state">
<text>In quantum mechanics, a singlet state usually refers to a system in which all electrons are paired. The term &#x27;singlet&#x27; originally meant a linked set of particles whose net angular momentum is zero, that is, whose overall spin quantum number formula_1. As a result, there is only one spectral line of a singlet state. In contrast, a doublet state contains one unpaired electron and shows splitting of spectral lines into a doublet, and a triplet state has two unpaired electrons and shows threefold splitting of spectral lines.

== History ==
Singlets and the related spin concepts of doublets and triplets occur frequently in atomic physics and nuclear physics, where one often needs to determine the total spin of a collection of particles. Since the only observed fundamental particle with zero spin is the extremely inaccessible Higgs boson, singlets in everyday physics are necessarily composed of sets of particles whose individual spins are non-zero, e.g. or 1.

The origin of the term &quot;singlet&quot; is that bound quantum systems with zero net angular momentum emit photons within a single spectral line, as opposed to double lines (doublet state) or triple lines (triplet state). The number of spectral lines formula_2 in this singlet-style terminology has a simple relationship to the spin quantum number: formula_3, and formula_4.

Singlet-style terminology is also used for systems whose mathematical properties are similar or identical to angular momentum spin states, even when traditional spin is not involved. In particular, the concept of isospin was developed early in the history of particle physics to address the remarkable similarities of protons and neutrons. Within atomic nuclei, protons and neutrons behave in many ways as if they were a single type of particle, the nucleon, with two states. The proton-neutron pair thus by analogy was referred to as a doublet, and the hypothesized underlying nucleon was assigned a spin-like doublet quantum number formula_5 to differentiate between those two states. Thus the neutron became a nucleon with isospin formula_6, and the proton a nucleon with formula_7. The isospin doublet notably shares the same SU(2) mathematical structure as the formula_8 angular momentum doublet. It should be mentioned that this early particle physics focus on nucleons was subsequently replaced by the more fundamental quark model, in which protons and neutrons are interpreted as bound systems of three quarks each. The isospin analogy also applies to quarks, and is the source of the names up (as in &quot;isospin up&quot;) and down (as in &quot;isospin down&quot;) for the quarks found in protons and neutrons.

While for angular momentum states the singlet-style terminology is seldom used beyond triplets (spin=1), it has proven historically useful for describing much larger particle groups and subgroups that share certain features and are distinguished from each other by quantum numbers beyond spin. An example of this broader use of singlet-style terminology is the nine-member &quot;nonet&quot; of the pseudoscalar mesons.

== Examples ==
The simplest possible angular momentum singlet is a set (bound or unbound) of two spin-1/2 (fermion) particles that are oriented so that their spin directions (&quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot;) oppose each other; that is, they are antiparallel.

The simplest possible bound particle pair capable of exhibiting the singlet state is positronium, which consists of an electron and positron (antielectron) bound by their opposite electric charges. The electron and positron in positronium can also have identical or parallel spin orientations, which results in an experimentally-distinct form of positronium with a spin 1 or triplet state.

An unbound singlet consists of a pair of entities small enough to exhibit quantum behavior (e.g. particles, atoms, or small molecules), not necessarily of the same type, for which four conditions hold:
# The spins of the two entities are of equal magnitude.
# The current spin values of both entities originated within a single well-defined quantum event (wave function) at some earlier location in classical space and time.
# The originating wave function relates the two entities in such a way that their net angular momentum must be zero, which in turn means that if and when they are detected experimentally, conservation of angular momentum will require their spins to be in full opposition (antiparallel).
# Their spin states have remained unperturbed since the originating quantum event – which is equivalent to asserting that there exists no classical information (observation) of their status anywhere within the universe.

Any spin value can be used for the pair, but the entanglement effect will be strongest both mathematically and experimentally if the spin magnitude is as small as possible, with the maximum possible effect occurring for entities with spin-1/2 (such as electrons and positrons). Early thought experiments for unbound singlets usually assumed the use of two antiparallel spin-1/2 electrons. However, actual experiments have tended to focus instead on using pairs of spin 1 photons. While the entanglement effect is somewhat less pronounced with such spin 1 particles, photons are easier to generate in correlated pairs and (usually) easier to keep in an unperturbed quantum state.

== Mathematical representations ==
The ability of positronium to form both singlet and triplet states is described mathematically by saying that the product of two doublet representations (meaning the electron and positron, which are both spin-1/2 doublets) can be decomposed into the sum of an adjoint representation (the triplet or spin 1 state) and a trivial representation (the singlet or spin 0 state). While the particle interpretation of the positronium triplet and singlet states is arguably more intuitive, the mathematical description enables precise calculations of quantum states and probabilities.

This greater mathematical precision for example makes it possible to assess how singlets and doublets behave under rotation operations. Since a spin-1/2 electron transforms as a doublet under rotation, its experimental response to rotation can be predicted by using the fundamental representation of that doublet, specifically the Lie group SU(2). Applying the operator formula_9 to the spin state of the electron thus will always result in formula_10, or spin-1/2, since the spin-up and spin-down states are both eigenstates of the operator with the same eigenvalue.

Similarly, for a system of two electrons, it is possible to measure the total spin by applying formula_11, where formula_12 acts on electron 1 and formula_13 acts on electron 2. Since this system has two possible spins, it also has two possible eigenvalues and corresponding eigenstates for the total spin operator, corresponding to the spin 0 and spin 1 states.

== Singlets and entangled states ==
Particles in singlet states do not need to be locally bound to each other. For example, when the spin states of two electrons are correlated by their emission from a single quantum event that conserves angular momentum, the resulting electrons remain in a shared singlet state even as their separation in space increases indefinitely over time, provided only that their angular momentum states remain unperturbed. In Dirac notation this distance-indifferent singlet state is usually represented as:

:formula_14

The possibility of spatially extended unbound singlet states has considerable historical and even philosophical importance, since considering such states contributed importantly to the theoretical and experimental exploration and verification of what is now called quantum entanglement. Along with Podolsky and Rosen, Einstein proposed the EPR paradox thought experiment to help define his concerns with what he viewed as the non-locality of spatially separated entangled particles, using it in an argument that quantum mechanics was incomplete. In 1951 David Bohm formulated a version of the &quot;paradox&quot; using spin singlet states.

The difficulty captured by the EPR-Bohm thought experiment was that by measuring a spatial component of the angular momentum of either of two particles that have been prepared in a spatially distributed singlet state, the quantum state of the remaining particle, conditioned on the measurement result obtained, appears to be &quot;instantaneously&quot; altered, even if the two particles have over time become separated by light years of distance. Decades later, John Stewart Bell, who was a strong advocate of Einstein&#x27;s locality-first perspective, proved Bell&#x27;s theorem and showed that it could be used to assess the existence or non-existence of singlet entanglement experimentally. The irony was that instead of disproving entanglement, which was Bell&#x27;s hope, subsequent experiments instead established the reality of entanglement. In fact, there now exist commercial quantum encryption devices whose operation depends fundamentally on the existence and behavior of spatially extended singlets.

A weaker form of Einstein&#x27;s locality principle remains intact, which is this: Classical information cannot be transmitted faster than the speed of light &quot;c&quot;, not even by using quantum entanglement events. This form of locality is weaker than the notion of &quot;Einstein locality&quot; or &quot;local realism&quot; used in the EPR and Bell&#x27;s Theorem papers, but is sufficient to prevent the emergence of causality paradoxes.

<text>The French Football Federation ( FFF and 3F; or Triple F; , ) is the governing body of football in France. It was formed in 1919 and is based in the capital, Paris. The FFF is a founding member of FIFA and is responsible for overseeing all aspects of the game of football in France, both professional and amateur. The French Football Federation is a founding member of UEFA and joined FIFA in 1907 after replacing the USFSA, who were founding members.

==History==
=== Background ===

Before the FFF was established, football, rugby union and others sports in France were regulated by the (USFSA). Founded in November 1890, the USFSA was initially headquartered in Paris but its membership soon expanded to include sports clubs from throughout France.

In 1894, the USFSA also organised the first recognised French football championship. The first competition featured just four Paris teams and was organised on a knockout basis.

In 1900, the USFSA sent players from Parisian Club Français to represent France at the 1900 Summer Olympics. On 1 May 1904 the USFSA also selected the first official France national football team. The USFSA would be dissolved in 1919 after some disagreements with FIFA.

The FFF announced to file a complaint with FIFA over racist and discriminatory remarks made by Argentina players in post-match chants after their Copa América win. The incident involved Enzo Fernández, who posted a video where players appeared to sing about French players of African heritage. Wesley Fofana condemned the video as &quot;uninhibited racism.&quot; Philippe Diallo condemned the remarks and planned to contact Argentina&#x27;s football federation and FIFA. Gianni Infantino had previously committed to a zero tolerance approach to racism.

=== Formation and evolution ===
The &quot;Fédération Française de Football&quot; was formed on 7 April 1919 following the transformation of the &quot;Comité Français Interfédéral&quot; (CFI) into the &quot;Fédération Française de Football Association&quot; (FFFA). The CFI were seen as a rival organization to the (USFSA) due to the organization&#x27;s constantly disagreeing with each other, mainly due to the latter&#x27;s opposition to professionalism in sport. Following the debacle at the 1908 Summer Olympics, in which France sent two teams, one controlled by the USFSA and another by FIFA, the CFI ruled that FIFA would now be responsible for the club&#x27;s appearances in forthcoming Olympic Games and not the USFSA. Being a founding member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the USFSA disagreed with the ruling and, despite having three years to reach an agreement, the CFI and the USFSA failed to, which led to France not sending a football team to the 1912 Summer Olympics. The USFSA later developed friction with FIFA and the IOC, which led to disorganization and in 1913, became semi-affiliated with the CFI.

On 7 April 1919 the CFI transformed themselves into the &quot;Fédération Française de Football&quot; with Jules Rimet being installed as the federation&#x27;s first president. Its legal status is placed under the French &quot;Association loi de 1901&quot; jurisdiction (Voluntary association). The FFF has been affiliated to FIFA since 1907, when the CFI succeeded the USFSA as France&#x27;s representative. Two years later after the CFI&#x27;s transformation, the USFSA officially merged with the federation.

On 28 June 2010, the federation&#x27;s current president, Jean-Pierre Escalettes, announced his resignation from his position effective 23 July. On 23 July, Fernand Duchaussoy was installed as the federation&#x27;s interim president and, on 18 December, the title was removed making him the federation&#x27;s 11th president in its history. On 18 June 2011, following as election, Nöel Le Graët was named as the federation&#x27;s 12th president.

== Activities ==
The French Football Federation describes itself in these four roles:

* To organize, develop, and monitor the teachings and practices of football in all its forms on the mainland and in the overseas regions and territories.
* To create and maintain a link between its individual members, affiliated clubs, and their respective districts and regional leagues of the Ligue du Football Amateur (LFA) and the Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP).
* To defend the moral and material interests of French football.
* To maintain all appropriate relations with foreign associations affiliated with FIFA, as well as their sporting organizations and national governments.

The FFF sanctions all competitive football matches in France, either directly, beginning with the on down, or indirectly through the Ligue de Football Professionnel, who manage Ligue 1 and Ligue 2, the first and second divisions of France, respectively, as well as the Coupe de la Ligue. The LFP, however, still operate under the authority of the federation. The federation is also responsible for appointing the management of the men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s and youth national football teams. In 2010, the FFF had 2,107,924 licenses, with over 1,800,000 registered players and 18,000 registered clubs. The federation unveiled its new crest (above right) in 2007.

The French Football Federation runs numerous competitions, the most famous of which is the annual Coupe de France. The Coupe de France is managed under the authority of the Federal Commission of the Coupe de France, which is directly attached to the Federal Council of the FFF. The federation also organizes the championships of the semi-professional and amateur leagues, such as the , the Championnat de France amateur and Championnat de France amateur 2, and the regional and departmental leagues, as well as the latter&#x27;s cup competitions.

The federation also governs youth leagues, such as the of the under-19s and under-17s. The FFF also oversee the organization of the Coupe Gambardella and the Coupe Nationale for the under-15 and under-13 club teams. The federation organizes all three divisions of women&#x27;s football in France and oversee the Challenge de France, the women&#x27;s premier cup competition.

== Regional associations ==
The FFF is divided into 20 regional associations, corresponding to the 18 regions of France (13 mainland and 5 overseas), plus two overseas collectivities (Saint Martin and Saint Pierre and Miquelon). Another overseas collectivity, Saint Barthélemy, has its own territorial committee but is recognized as a district of the Guadeloupe regional association. French Polynesia and New Caledonia are members of FIFA in their own right and do not have regional bodies within the FFF. Wallis and Futuna is the only inhabited territory of France to not have organized football at any level.

Regional associations are responsible for organizing all competitions below Level 5 in the French league system. The number of regional associations was reduced by nine after the 2016 redrawing of regions in France.

== Academies ==
The French Football Force operates 14 &quot;élite&quot; academies throughout the country of France, the most famous being the INF Clairefontaine, which was created by former FFF president Fernand Sastre in 1976. Located 50 km southwest of Paris in Clairefontaine-en-Yvelines, INF Clairefontaine is arguably the finest football academy in the world. It has a high reputation of producing some of the most gifted French players including Nicolas Anelka, Louis Saha, William Gallas and former national team top scorer Thierry Henry.

=== Registration ===
Players selected to an academy must be at least 13 years of age, have French nationality (rule valid until 2010), and be living and playing within the region of the academy the player is registering for. Registration for new players at an academy normally begins in October the year before players enroll at the academy when prospective applicants are 12 years of age. Players have until December to register with their club for acceptance into the academy. The first set of trials are carried out by each district within its respective region. Each district selects a set number of players who will travel to the region&#x27;s academy to attend a tryout, which is usually held over a three-day period. The dates of the tryouts vary depending on the academy. The Clairefontaine academy normally hold its tryouts during the Easter school holidays, however the academy in Châteauroux holds its tryouts in June. After the three days, the academy director and officials will convene to select a maximum of 22 players with three or four of the 22 being goalkeepers. The number of players selected also vary depending on the academy.

=== Training and accommodation ===
Players who are selected to attend an academy stay and train at the facilities from Monday through Friday. Players are given the weekend off to go and visit family and, also, to train and play with their parent clubs. They are given school holidays off, as well. Players are also required to meet educational criteria. For example, players age 13–15 training at Clairefontaine attend the Collège Catherine de Vivonne de Rambouilet in Rambouillet. After departing Rambouilet, players enroll at the nearby high school Lycée Louis Bascan de Rambouillet with hopes that they will earn their Baccalauréat. All costs required to attend an academy are borne by the federation and the Ligue Nationale de Football.

<text>Lucien Denis Gabriel Albéric Magnard (; 9 June 1865 – 3 September 1914) was a French composer, somewhat influenced by César Franck and Vincent d&#x27;Indy. Magnard became a national hero in 1914 when he refused to surrender his property to German invaders and died defending it.

==Biography==
Magnard was born in Paris, the son of , a bestselling author and editor of &quot;Le Figaro&quot;. Albéric could have chosen to live the comfortable life that his family&#x27;s wealth afforded him, but he disliked being called &quot;fils du Figaro&quot; and decided to make a career for himself in music, based entirely on his own talent and without any help from family connections. After military service and graduating from law school, he entered the Paris Conservatoire, where he studied counterpoint with Théodore Dubois and went to the classes of Jules Massenet. There he met Vincent d&#x27;Indy, with whom he studied fugue and orchestration for four years, writing his first two Symphonies under d&#x27;Indy&#x27;s tutelage. Magnard dedicated his Symphony No. 1 to d&#x27;Indy; and the two men always respected each other, despite their marked political differences (Magnard was pro-Dreyfus).
Francis Magnard did what he could to support Albéric&#x27;s career while trying to respect his son&#x27;s wish to make it on his own. This included publicity in &quot;Le Figaro.&quot; With the death of his father in 1894, Albéric Magnard&#x27;s grief was complicated by his simultaneous gratitude to and annoyance with his father.

In 1896, Magnard married Julie Creton, became a counterpoint tutor at the Schola Cantorum (recently founded by d&#x27;Indy) and wrote his Symphony No. 3 in B-flat minor.

==Death==

In 1914, at the beginning of World War I, Magnard sent his wife and two daughters to a safe hiding place while he stayed behind to guard the estate of &quot;Manoir de Fontaines&quot; at Baron, Oise. When German soldiers trespassed on the property, Magnard fired at them, killing one soldier, and they fired back before setting the house on fire. It is believed that Magnard died in the fire, although his body could not be identified in the ruins. The fire destroyed all of Magnard&#x27;s unpublished scores, including the orchestral score of his early opera &quot;Yolande&quot;, the orchestral score of &quot;Guercoeur&quot; (the piano reduction had been published, and the orchestral score of the second act was extant), and a more recent song cycle. Guy Ropartz, who had led a concert performance of the third act of &quot;Guercoeur&quot; at Nancy in February 1908, would subsequently reconstruct from memory the orchestration of the acts that had been lost in the fire, and the Paris Opéra gave the work a belated world premiere in 1931.

==Music==
Magnard&#x27;s primary musical influences were contemporary French composers, particularly César Franck. Although he devoted much of his compositional efforts towards opera, nowadays he is probably best known for his four symphonies, certain passages of which demonstrate a more Germanic influence. His use of fugue and incorporation of chorale, together with the grandeur of expression in his mature orchestral works, have caused him to be called a &quot;French Bruckner&quot;. Although Bruckner used cyclical forms long before d&#x27;Indy &quot;trademarked&quot; the concept to César Franck&#x27;s name, Magnard&#x27;s handling of cyclical form is more Franckian than Brucknerian. In his operas, Magnard used Richard Wagner&#x27;s leitmotiv technique.

Magnard&#x27;s whole musical output numbers a total of just 22 opus numbers. Along with the symphonies and operas are a handful of chamber works including a single string quartet, a quintet for piano and winds, a piano trio, a violin sonata (in G, opus 13), and a cello sonata (in A, opus 20). A few more were published posthumously, including the &quot;Quatre poèmes en musique&quot;, four songs for baritone and piano.

<doc id="682013" wikidata="Q4806786" url="?curid=682013" title="Asian carp">
<text>Asian carp is an informal grouping of several species of cyprinid freshwater fishes native to Eurasia, commonly referring to the four East Asian species silver carp, bighead carp, grass carp (a.k.a. white amur) and black carp (a.k.a. black amur), which were introduced to North America during the 1970s and now regarded as invasive in the United States. These four species, now also known commercially as Copi in the United States, are staple food fish in their native China, where they are collectively known as &quot;qing cao lian yong&quot; (青草鲢鳙) or &quot;si da jia yu&quot; (四大家鱼, &quot;Four Great Domestic Fish&quot;) and are farmed extensively.

==Asian carp and related fish==
* &quot;H. molitrix&quot; – silver carp, silverfin, lian
* &quot;H. nobilis&quot; – bighead carp, yong
* &quot;Ct. idella&quot; – grass carp, white amur, cao
* &quot;M. piceus&quot; – black carp, black amur, qing

===Other &quot;Cyprinoidei&quot; fish farmed in China===
Common carp, amur carp and crucian carp are also common food fishes in China and elsewhere. Goldfish, though, are cultivated mainly as pet fish.

* &quot;C. carpio&quot; – common carp
* &quot;C. rubrofuscus&quot; – Amur carp
* &quot;C. auratus&quot; – goldfish
* &quot;C. carasius&quot; – crucian carp, crucian
* &quot;C. molitorella&quot; – dace, mud carp
* &quot;M. amblycephala&quot; – blunt snout bream, Wuchang bream

==Characteristics==

These four fish have been cultivated in aquaculture in China for over 1,000 years.

Bighead and silver carp are the most important fish, worldwide, in terms of total aquaculture production. 

Asian carp are big fish, with black amur adults grow as big as 33 lbs (15 kg) in average, with the biggest one weighing 150 lbs (70 kg).

Bighead and silver carp are able to crossbreed and produce hybrid offspring.

===Jumping of silver carp===
Silver carp are easily frightened by boats, which cause them to leap between into the air, and numerous boaters have been severely injured by collisions with the fish. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, &quot;reported injuries include cuts from fins, black eyes, broken bones, back injuries, and concussions&quot;. This behavior has sometimes been attributed to the very similar bighead carp, but these do not normally jump when frightened. Catching jumping carp in nets has become part of the Redneck Fishing Tournament in Bath, Illinois.

== Recreational fishing ==
The grass carp (&quot;Ctenopharyngodon idella&quot;), and black carp (&quot;Mylopharyngodon piceus&quot;) as well as common carp (&quot;Cyprinus carpio&quot;) are popular targets for recreational fisherman in the Midwest, despite their status of being an invasive species. These species are unique because of their ability to be caught with the traditional fishing technique of using a fishing rod, reel and a hook. Other invasive carp species – the Silver carp (&quot;Hypophthalmichthys molitrix&quot;) and bighead carp (&quot;Hypophthalmichthys nobilis&quot;) are not traditionally caught on rod and reel because they feed on plankton, therefore they do not bite on baited hooks or lures.

== As food ==

Asian carp have been a popular food fish in Asia for thousands of years. In North America, the various Asian carp are often lumped with the common carp and seen as undesirable trash fish because of the unpopularity of common carp as food in this region. Furthermore, even the common carp, which was introduced to North America from Europe in the 17th century, are important food fish outside North America.

The pearly white flesh — though complicated by intermuscular bones — has a mild taste. The filter-feeding silver and bighead carp have much lower heavy metal contamination (such as mercury) than most other fish because they are algivorous primary consumers that do not eat other aquatic invertebrates or fishes and therefore are the least impacted by biomagnification.

A famous dish in Hangzhou called &quot;Xi Hu cu yu&quot; (), traditionally made of white amur, is a dish of controversial flavor.

Copi is available in restaurants in Illinois, Arizona and Washington, DC.; in 7 fish markets in Illinois and Tennessee; and through 7 fish distributors in Illinois, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Maryland and Wisconsin.

===Pet food===
There are companies making pet food using silver carp in the US and Canada.

==As ornamental fish==
Yuquan (), one of the well-known scenic spots in Hangzhou, has a large fish pond alive with hundreds of fish of various colors. As of 2022, many of the fish there are black amur, with additional bighead carp, nishikigoi, sharpbelly and white amur. A three-character inscription, &quot;Yu Le Guo&quot; (), meaning &quot;fish&#x27;s paradise&quot;, is set above one end of the pond in the calligraphy of a famous gentry-scholar of the late Ming Dynasty named Dong Qichang ().

==Introduction to North America==
===Environmental impact===
Some species of Asian carp cause harm when they are introduced to new environments. The black carp feeds on native mussels and snails, some of which are already endangered. Grass carp can alter the food webs of a new environment by altering the communities of plants, invertebrates, and fish. Silver carp feed on the plankton necessary for larval fish and native mussels.

Bighead and silver carp feed by filtering plankton from the water. The extremely high abundance of bighead and silver carp has caused great concern because of the potential for competition with native species for food and living space. Because of their filter-feeding habits, they are difficult to capture by normal angling methods.

===History===
In the late 19th century, the common carp was distributed widely throughout the United States by the United States Fish Commission as a foodfish. 
In the 1970s, fish farmers in mostly southern states began importing Asian carp from China to help clean their commercial ponds. The rise in the populations of bighead and silver carp has been dramatic where they are established in the Mississippi River basin.

Because of their prominence, and because they were imported to the United States much later than other carp native to Asia, the term &quot;Asian carp&quot; is often used with the intended meaning of only grass, black, silver, and bighead carp. In the U.S., Asian carp are considered to be invasive species. Of the carp species introduced to the United States, only two (crucian and black carp) are not known to be firmly established. Crucian carp is probably extirpated. Since 2003, however, several adults, fertile black carp have been captured from the Atchafalaya and other rivers connected to the Mississippi River. Dr. Leo Nico, in the book &quot;Black carp: Biological Synopsis and Risk Assessment of an Introduced Fish&quot;, reports that black carp are probably established in the United States. In South Florida, the local water management district actually stocks the canals with sterilized grass carp to control the hydrilla plant, which tends to block the locks and drainage valves used to control water flow from the Everglades.

===Distribution===
Bighead, silver, and grass carp are known to be well-established in the Mississippi River basin (including tributaries), where they at times reach extremely high numbers, especially in the case of the bighead and silver carp. Bighead, silver, and grass carp have been captured in that watershed from Louisiana to South Dakota, Minnesota, and Ohio. Grass carp are also established in at least one other watershed, in Texas, and may be established elsewhere.
Grass carp have been captured in all of the Great Lakes except Lake Superior, but so far, no evidence indicates a reproducing population. No silver carp or black carp have yet been found in any of the Great Lakes. Common carp are abundant throughout the Great Lakes.

A few bighead and grass carp have been captured in Canada&#x27;s portions of the Great Lakes, but no Asian carp (other than common carp) is known to be established in Canada at this time. Concerns exist that the silver carp may spread into Cypress Hills in Alberta and Saskatchewan through Battle Creek, the Frenchman River, and other rivers flowing south out of the hills into the Milk River. Ontario does not have Asian carp yet and has used the provincial Invasive Species Act to prohibit their import.

In Mexico, grass carp have been established for many years in at least two river systems, where they are considered invasive, but no other Asian carp are known to have been introduced.

==Management in the US==
===Field actions===
These fish are thought to be highly detrimental to the environment in parts of the United States. Because of these concerns, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service convened stakeholders to develop a national plan for the management and control of invasive Asian carp (referring to bighead, silver, black, and grass carp). The plan was accepted by the National Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force in the fall of 2007.

As of 2016, efforts were being made to reintroduce alligator gar between Tennessee and Illinois as part of an effort to control Asian carp.

In 2019 the Kentucky declared &quot;War on Carp&quot; and started to use electro-fishing and sonic devices to remove 5 million pounds of Asian carp from Lake Barkley and Kentucky Lake.

Electro-fishing has become an extensive technique in population management of Asian carp throughout the Midwest&#x27;s river systems. It involves the use of electric waves that stun (non-lethally) the invasive fish at the surface of the water, where fisherman can then corral them into net and remove from the ecosystem. Electro-fishing is also safe for the native species of fish that cohabit the waters where it is implemented, because they avoid the electro-fishing boats by diving deeper into the water column, where as the carp jump near the surface, getting stunned in the process.

There have been conclusive results that have proven electro-fishing to be an effective and efficient way to manage the Asian carp invasion in Midwestern waterways. A typical electro-fishing boat can shock 100 carp per minute of fishing utilizing 110–500 volts of electricity, the fish captured are then humanely killed, and used as food or fertilizer for crops. However, the technique has sparked questions about potential negative impacts that it may have on the rivers&#x27; ecosystems. If electro-fishing boats go over spawning grounds for native fish, it could potentially cause harm to fish embryos.

===Branding===
In June 2022, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources announced a campaign to rebrand Asian carp as Copi, which is a clipping of &quot;copious&quot;, referring to the large amount of the fish in the US. This branding work was completed in 2022 by Span. The Copi renaming is a part of a Federal and state initiative to get the public to eat the invasive fish, decrease its numbers in Midwestern waterways, and prevent its introduction to the Great Lakes.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)&#x27;s Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) is funding the Copi rebrand of Asian carp.

Success of the Copi rebrand of the invasive fish will be measured using pounds of removal as the key metric. Removal was projected to total 6,000,000 lbs at launch of the Copi rebrand, and increase to 12,000,000 in the first year following. Removal at 2 months from launch exceeded 10,000,000 lbs, on pace to beat year 1 projections.

===Legislation===

The Stop Asian Carp Act of 2011 was introduced to require the Secretary of the Army to study the feasibility of the hydrological separation, such as electric barriers, of the Great Lakes and Mississippi River basins. The act provided 30 days for the Secretary of the Army to begin a study on the best means of implementing a hydrological separation of the Great Lakes to prevent the introduction of Asian carp. The study requirements included researching techniques that prevented the spread of carp from flooding, wastewater and storm water infrastructure, waterway safety operations, and barge and recreational traffic.

In 2012, the U.S. Senate and House introduced new bills aimed at combating the spread of Asian carp into the Great Lakes by expediting some items of the Stop Asian Carp Act of 2011. The legislation provides direction to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to complete their study within 18 months on how to separate the Great Lakes from the Mississippi watersheds.

The Water Resources Development Act of 2020 was passed by Congress to provide $25 million to efforts against the invasive species in the Tennessee and Cumberland river basins.

In April 2023, a new, extensive plan was created by the Invasive Carp Regional Coordinating Committee to launch over 50 projects to combat the growing Asian carp invasion in the Great Lakes region of the Midwest. The committee is partnering with a collaboration of 26 U.S. and Canadian federal, state, provincial, tribal, regional and local agencies to work on new technologies and strategies to implement against Asian carp spreading to the Great Lakes.

The 2023 Invasive Carp Action Plan includes the following:

* The Brandon Road Project, led by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to prevent carp from entering the Great Lakes by establishing structural and non-structural control measures in Will County, Illinois.
* The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is working with the committee to upgrade sections of the earthen berm at Little Killbuck Creek, Ohio. This location contains a hydraulic connection between the Mississippi River and the Lake Eire water sheds when the water is high. This projects aims to close this aquatic pathway for the invasive species of carp, and further prevent their spreading into Lake Erie.
* Operating electric dispersal barriers in the Chicago Area Waterway System, to include the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal that connects to Lake Michigan.
* The U.S. army Corps of Engineers will also conduct experiments with new technologies in underwater acoustics and carbon dioxide deterrent barriers to prevent the migration of invasive carp into the Great Lakes region.
* The Department of Natural Resources will also organize commercial fishing of the invasive carp species in the upper Illinois River to reduce the population and the risk of upstream expansion northbound.

<text>The Steyr IWS 2000 is an Austrian single-shot bolt-action anti-materiel rifle produced by Steyr Mannlicher. IWS stands for Infantry Weapon System. Unlike other anti-tank rifle designs, it has a smoothbore barrel. This facilitates higher projectile velocities and allows a longer barrel service life, but the lack of gyroscopic spin-stabilization requires the projectile to have aerodynamic stabilizing fins instead. The IWS is chambered in a 15.2×169 mm armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding-sabot cartridge, and is the first man-portable rifle to use this type of ammunition.

The first variant of the weapon was the proposed AMR 5075 (AMR standing for anti-materiel rifle). It was to fire the same type of ammunition as the IWS 2000 and to use a 5-round detachable box magazine. However, that version did not pass the proposal stage.

==Design==
The weapon is based on a long recoil mechanism. This mechanism, usually found in shotguns, helps manage the heavy recoil forces of the 15.2 mm Steyr APFSDS round due to its damping effect that allows for force distribution over a longer period of time. After firing, the barrel recoils into a shock-absorbing hydro-pneumatic sleeve much like those found on a LG 1 Mark II 105 mm Howitzer. The IWS 2000 also uses a multi-baffle muzzle brake to distribute muzzle energy and further reduce recoil, similar to that used on the D-30 2A18M 122 mm towed howitzer. The entire rifle body is made up of a combination of high-tension plastics and superlight polymers to increase manageability and cut down on weight. The smoothbore barrel is easily detached and packed away for increased mobility. The APFSDS round is inserted from the side of the weapon, much like with usual single-shot rifles.

==Ammunition==
The projectile is a 20-gram, 15.2 mm fin-stabilized discarding-sabot type with armor-piercing capability which the IWS 2000 was specifically designed to fire only. It contains a dart-shaped penetrator of either tungsten carbide or depleted uranium, capable of piercing 40 mm of rolled homogeneous armor at a range of 1,000 m, as well as causing secondary fragmentation. The cartridge consists of a plastic case, a steel head, and a plastic sabot shell around the penetrator, and has a maximum diameter of 26 millimeters, at its base. The complete projectile assembly with its four sabot segments weighs 35 grams.

<text>Christophe Kenner (December 25, 1929 – January 25, 1976) was an American, New Orleans–based R&amp;B singer and songwriter, best known for two hit singles in the early 1960s, &quot;I Like It Like That&quot; and &quot;Land of 1000 Dances&quot;, which became staples in the repertoires of many other musicians.

==Biography==
Born on Christmas Day, in the farming community of Kenner, Louisiana, upriver from New Orleans, Kenner sang gospel music with his church choir. He moved to New Orleans when he was in his teens, to work as a stevedore.

In 1955 he made his first recordings, for a small label, Baton Records, without success. In 1957, he recorded his &quot;Sick and Tired&quot; for Imperial Records. Kenner&#x27;s recording reached No. 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart. Fats Domino covered it the next year, and his version became a hit on the pop chart. &quot;Rocket to the Moon&quot; and &quot;Life Is Just a Struggle&quot;, both cut for Ron Records, were other notable songs Kenner recorded in this period.

Moving to another New Orleans label, Instant (which initially was called &#x27;Valiant&#x27; before they discovered the name was already in use), he began to work with the pianist and arranger Allen Toussaint. In 1961, this collaboration produced &quot;I Like It Like That&quot;, his biggest and first pop hit, peaking at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart (covered in 1965 by the Dave Clark Five), and &quot;Something You Got&quot; (covered by Wilson Pickett, Alvin Robinson, the Ramsey Lewis Trio, Johnny Rivers, Chuck Jackson and Maxine Brown, and Earl Grant, Fats Domino, Bobby Womack, the Moody Blues, the Searchers, the American Breed, Fairport Convention, Bruce Springsteen, Them, and Jimi Hendrix). &quot;I Like It Like That&quot; sold over one million copies, was nominated for a Grammy Award, and was awarded a gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America.

In 1963 he released his most enduring song, &quot;Land of 1000 Dances&quot;, based on an old spiritual. Kenner&#x27;s version reached No. 77 on the pop chart in 1963. It was later covered by various artists, including Cannibal &amp; the Headhunters, Fats Domino, Thee Midniters, Wilson Pickett, the Action, and Patti Smith. Kenner continued to record for Instant and for other small local labels, including many of his lesser-known songs from the 1960s, such as &quot;My Wife&quot;, &quot;Packing Up&quot; and &quot;They Took My Money&quot;. He released an album, &quot;Land of 1000 Dances&quot;, on Atlantic Records in 1966; it was reissued on CD by Collectors&#x27; Choice in 2007.

Kenner&#x27;s career was affected by his unpredictable behavior – he drank and spent heavily, and he sometimes missed shows or forgot the words to his songs. He continued to record until 1968, with diminishing success. In 1968, Kenner was convicted of unlawful sex with a minor and spent three years in Louisiana&#x27;s Angola prison.

Kenner died from a heart attack in 1976, at the age of 46, triggered by alcoholism.

<text>Brendan Morrison (born August 15, 1975) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey centre. He has played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the New Jersey Devils, Vancouver Canucks, Anaheim Ducks, Dallas Stars, Washington Capitals, Calgary Flames and Chicago Blackhawks.

Morrison was selected 39th overall in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft by the Devils after a season in the British Columbia Junior Hockey League (BCJHL); he had won rookie of the year honours for the Interior Conference as a member of the Penticton Panthers. Following his draft, he joined the college ice hockey ranks with the Michigan Wolverines of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA). During his four-year collegiate career, he was named the NCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player while leading the Wolverines to a national championship in 1996 and won the Hobey Baker Award as the NCAA&#x27;s player of the year in 1997.

Turning professional in 1997–98, Morrison was named to the American Hockey League (AHL) All-Rookie Team as a member of the Albany River Rats. He played his rookie season in the NHL the following season with the New Jersey Devils before being traded to the Vancouver Canucks in March 2000. He played seven full seasons with the Canucks, which included a club-record 534 consecutive regular season games played. As a member of the team&#x27;s &quot;West Coast Express&quot; line (alongside Markus Näslund and Todd Bertuzzi), Morrison enjoyed the most successful years of his career, posting three consecutive 60-point seasons. During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, he played one season with Linköpings HC of the Swedish Elite League. Beginning in 2008, he played stints with the Anaheim Ducks, Dallas Stars and Washington Capitals before joining the Calgary Flames in 2010.

Internationally, Morrison has competed for Canada in three World Championships, winning gold in 2004 and silver in 2005.

==Playing career==

===Amateur career (1992–97)===
Morrison played one season with the Penticton Panthers of the British Columbia Junior Hockey League (BCJHL) in 1992–93, recording 94 points (35 goals and 59 assists) over 56 games. He ranked second in team scoring, behind Marcel Sakáč, and was awarded the Bruce Allison Memorial Trophy as the Interior Conference&#x27;s rookie of the year. In the off-season, Morrison was selected by the New Jersey Devils 39th overall in the second round of the 1993 NHL Entry Draft.

Upon being drafted, he joined the Michigan Wolverines of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA). He had also been approached by the Denver Pioneers and the Maine Black Bears to join their school teams, but ultimately chose Michigan. Registering 48 points (20 goals and 28 assists) over 38 games as a freshman, Morrison was named the CCHA Rookie of the Year for the 1993–94 season. He played on a line with fellow freshman Jason Botterill; the two played together throughout their college career. In the 1994 playoffs, he helped the Wolverines to a CCHA championship. Playing in his sophomore year (1994–95), Morrison improved to 76 points (23 goals and 43 assists) over 39 games and received his first of three consecutive CCHA First Team All-Star selections.

With 72 points over 45 games in 1995–96, Morrison received his first of back-to-back CCHA Player of the Year awards. He added 15 points in seven postseason games to capture his second CCHA championship with the Wolverines. Advancing to the 1996 NCAA Tournament, Michigan advanced to the final against the Colorado College Tigers. Morrison scored the championship-winning goal 3:35 into overtime to win the game 3–2. It was the Wolverines&#x27; first national title in 32 years. Michigan&#x27;s championship-winning team that year included five future NHL players—Morrison, Botterill, Blake Sloan, John Madden, Marty Turco and Bill Muckalt. In addition to receiving NCAA Tournament MVP honours, Morrison was named to the NCAA West Regional and NCAA All-Tournament Teams.

Morrison was named team captain in his senior year. He totalled college personal bests that season of 31 goals, 57 assists and 88 points over 43 games, culminating in a Hobey Baker Award as the NCAA&#x27;s most outstanding player; Morrison had been a finalist for the award the previous two years. The Wolverines repeated as CCHA champions, but lost to the Boston University Terriers in the NCAA semifinal. Morrison completed his four-year college career as the Wolverines&#x27; all-time points leader with 284, surpassing Denny Felsner. His points total also ranked seventh all-time among NCAA players.

===New Jersey Devils (1997–2000)===
Prior to the Devils&#x27; training camp, Morrison was signed by the team to a multi-year contract on September 9, 1997. He was seen as an unlikely candidate to secure a roster spot with the Devils; ahead of Morrison on the depth chart were numerous centres, including Doug Gilmour, Bobby Holík and Petr Sýkora. As such, he played the majority of the 1997–98 season in the American Hockey League (AHL) with the Devils&#x27; minor league affiliate, the Albany River Rats. He scored 35 goals and 84 points over 72 games in the AHL, ranking first in team scoring and eighth in the League overall. He finished second among League rookies in scoring, eight points behind Daniel Brière of the Springfield Falcons, and was named to the AHL All-Rookie Team. His AHL season included a five-goal game against the Hartford Wolfpack on April 1, 1998; two of his goals came short handed into an empty net, as part of a 5–2 Albany win. The feat was one goal shy of the AHL&#x27;s single-game record.

Morrison also made his NHL debut during the 1997–98 season. He was called up to the Devils in December 1997 as a replacement for winger John MacLean, who had been informally suspended by General Manager Lou Lamoriello after requesting to be traded. Playing in his first NHL game on December 4, 1997, Morrison scored against goaltender Tom Barrasso in a 4–0 win against the Pittsburgh Penguins. He received a second call-up in April 1998. Competing in 11 NHL games, he finished the season with five goals and four assists.

The following season, he secured a full-time roster spot with the Devils. With Doug Gilmour having left the team as a free agent in the 1998 off-season, Morrison was expected to help fill the void at centre. His 46 points (13 goals and 33 assists) over 76 games finished second among NHL rookies behind Milan Hejduk of the Colorado Avalanche. He ranked fifth in Calder Memorial Trophy voting as the League&#x27;s rookie of the year with one first-place ballot (the award was given to the Avalanche&#x27;s Chris Drury).

Becoming a restricted free agent in the off-season, Morrison was given a one-year qualifying offer with a reported value of approximately US$500,000. With the Devils unwilling to increase their offer, he left in September 1999 for Třebíč, Czech Republic, where fellow Devils restricted free agent Patrik Eliáš was also holding out. While overseas, Morrison and Eliáš played for Czech teams SK Horácká Slavia Třebíč and HC Pardubice as they waited for contract negotiations to resume. Morrison was pointless in two games with Třebíč and recorded seven points in five games with Pardubice. On October 24, 1999, Morrison and Eliáš agreed to new contracts with the Devils. After recording 26 points over 44 games with the Devils, Morrison was traded to the Vancouver Canucks on March 14, 2000, alongside centre Denis Pederson, in exchange for winger Alexander Mogilny. Both Morrison and Pederson were struggling offensively and were unhappy with their roles on the team.

===Vancouver Canucks (2000–08)===

Morrison finished the 1999–2000 season with nine points in 12 games with the Canucks for a combined total of 35 points in 56 games. In the off-season, he re-signed with the Canucks. Playing in his first full season with the Canucks in 2000–01, Morrison improved to 54 points (16 goals and 38 assists) over 82 games. He helped the team reach the postseason for the first time since 1996, as Vancouver secured the eighth and final seed in the Western Conference. Facing the Colorado Avalanche in the first round, the Canucks were swept in four games. Morrison scored his first NHL playoff goal during the series and finished with three points in four games.

The 2001–02 campaign marked the beginning of what was widely considered to be the most effective line combination in the NHL for several years. During a game on January 9, 2002, Morrison replaced Andrew Cassels as the centreman on the team&#x27;s first line with wingers Markus Näslund and Todd Bertuzzi. He went on to record his three best statistical seasons in the NHL while playing with the two wingers. The latter two finished second and third in NHL scoring in 2001–02, while Morrison tallied 23 goals and 67 points over 82 games. Morrison&#x27;s playmaking ability complemented his wingers&#x27; goal-scoring prowess. Together, they were known for playing a fast and entertaining style; as a result, head coach Marc Crawford implemented a highly-offensive coaching strategy. The trio were dubbed the &quot;West Coast Express,&quot; named after Vancouver&#x27;s commuter rail service of the same name.

Despite finishing as the NHL&#x27;s top-scoring team, the Canucks entered the 2002 playoffs as the eighth seed in the West for the second consecutive season. Facing the Detroit Red Wings in the opening round, they were eliminated in six games. Morrison notched two assists during the series. After initially failing to come to terms on a new contract with the Canucks in the off-season, Morrison filed for arbitration. He won his hearing and was awarded a two-year, US$4.6 million contract on August 3, 2002, more than doubling his previous year&#x27;s salary of US$775,000.

The following season, Morrison recorded career-highs with 25 goals, 46 assists, and 71 points in 82 games. He ranked 26th in NHL point-scoring, while Näslund and Bertuzzi finished second and fifth, respectively. He helped the Canucks come within a point of the Northwest Division title, entering the 2003 playoffs as the fourth seed in the West. After eliminating the St. Louis Blues in the opening round, they were defeated by the Minnesota Wild in a seven-game second round series. Morrison had a career-high four goals, seven assists and 11 points over 14 postseason games.

In 2003–04, Morrison registered 22 goals and 60 points over 82 games as all members of the Canucks&#x27; top line experienced declines in offensive production. Bertuzzi was replaced on Morrison&#x27;s wing after he was suspended indefinitely by the NHL for sucker punching Steve Moore in a game against Colorado in March 2004; he was replaced on the Canucks&#x27; top line by Matt Cooke. Nonetheless, the Canucks won their first-ever Northwest Division title and went into the 2004 playoffs as the West&#x27;s third seed. Facing elimination in game six of the opening round against the Calgary Flames, Morrison scored there minutes into the contest&#x27;s third overtime session to force a seventh game. Having skated from the corner boards with the puck, Morrison stickhandled across the net and scored past Calgary goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff. The Canucks were then eliminated in Game 7; Morrison finished the playoff season with five points. Becoming a restricted free agent in the off-season, he filed for salary arbitration against the Canucks for the second time in two years. Both sides managed to avoid their hearing by agreeing to a one-year deal on July 27, 2004.

In lieu of the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Morrison went overseas to play in the Swedish Elite League, signing with Linköpings HC on September 15, 2004. With 44 points (16 goals and 29 assists) over 45 games, he ranked second in team scoring (behind Kristian Huselius) and sixth in League scoring. After finishing with the second-best regular season in the SEL, Linköping was eliminated in the first round by Södertälje SK.

With NHL play set to resume the next season, Morrison re-signed with the Canucks at US$9.6 million over three years. He suffered a torn labrum in his hip in December 2005, but chose to play through the injury. He finished the season with 19 goals and 56 points over 82 games in 2005–06, as the Canucks failed to qualify for the playoffs. Head Coach Marc Crawford recalled that by the end of the season, the line of Morrison, Bertuzzi and Näslund had been surpassed as the top unit by Daniel and Henrik Sedin. In the off-season, Morrison underwent surgery for his hip injury and missed two months of workout and conditioning while recovering. Also in the summer, Bertuzzi was traded to the Florida Panthers, marking the end of the West Coast Express line.

Morrison&#x27;s hip continued to hinder his play in 2006–07, contributing to a slow start early in the season. Later in the campaign, he set a Canucks record for consecutive regular season games played (colloquially known as an &quot;ironman streak&quot;); he had not missed a contest since arriving to the team from New Jersey. Playing against the Los Angeles Kings on February 22, 2007, he surpassed Trevor Linden&#x27;s old club record of 482 consecutive games played (his overall streak was at 491 games, including eight contests played with the Devils prior to his trade). Three days later, he became the League&#x27;s active ironman when Avalanche defenceman Kārlis Skrastiņš was forced to miss a game with a knee injury. Skrastiņš had played in 495 consecutive games, while Morrison had 492 at the time. Offensively, Morrison finished the year with his sixth consecutive 50-point season in the NHL with 20 goals and 31 assists over 82 games. The Canucks returned to the postseason and advanced to the second round, where they were eliminated by the Anaheim Ducks. Morrison recorded 4 points in 12 playoff games.

Morrison began the 2007–08 season with a minor wrist injury suffered during a game during the pre-season; he chose to play through the injury for months. He extended his ironman streak to 542 games before opting for wrist surgery on December 12, 2007. The streak, which had begun on February 27, 2000 with the Devils, was the 11th longest in NHL history, 404 games short of Doug Jarvis&#x27; NHL record. Morrison was succeeded as the league&#x27;s active ironman by Flames defenceman Cory Sarich, who had played in 419 consecutive games at the time of Morrison&#x27;s injury. Morrison&#x27;s Canucks record of 534 consecutive games played was later surpassed by Henrik Sedin on December 26, 2011 (the game in which Sedin tied the record was played between the Canucks and Morrison&#x27;s Calgary Flames). After undergoing wrist surgery in December 2007, Morrison returned to the Canucks lineup in February 2008, having missed 38 games. The following month, Morrison tore the ACL in his right knee during a game on March 28, forcing him to miss the remaining four contests of the regular season. He underwent knee surgery 10 days later. Limited to 39 games due to his injuries, Morrison recorded nine goals and 25 points in 2007–08. The Canucks finished out of the playoffs for the second time in three seasons.

Becoming an unrestricted free agent in the off-season, Morrison ended his career with the Canucks ninth overall on the team&#x27;s all-time scoring list with 393 points in 543 games.

===Post-Vancouver (2008–2012)===
Morrison signed with the Anaheim Ducks to a one-year, US$2.75 million contract on July 7, 2008. He had received interest from as many as nine NHL teams, including the Canucks, who offered a one-year, US$1.9 million deal prior to Morrison&#x27;s free agency. Morrison scored his first goal as a Duck on November 7 in a 5–2 loss to the Dallas Stars. While it was hoped he could be a replacement for Andy McDonald as the team&#x27;s second-line centre, Morrison struggled in his short tenure with the Ducks. He was relegated to the fourth line and made a healthy scratch at various points in the season. It was proposed by the media that he was not yet playing at full capacity on account of his off-season knee surgery. With 22 points in 62 games, he was waived by the Ducks leading up to the NHL trade deadline on March 3, 2009. He was claimed the following day by the Dallas Stars. He scored his first goal with the Stars on March 12, the game-winner in a 3–2 contest against the Carolina Hurricanes. Morrison&#x27;s 2008–09 total of 31 points between the Ducks and Stars was the lowest output of his career (not including the previous season&#x27;s injury-shortened campaign and his 11-game 1997–98 season).
In the off-season, he was signed as an unrestricted free agent by the Washington Capitals to a one-year, US$1.5 million contract on July 10, 2009. He registered his first goal as a Capital in the team&#x27;s home opener, a 6–4 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs, on October 3, 2009. In the final two months of the season, Morrison missed six games due to a leg injury. He finished the campaign with 42 points in 74 games with the Capitals, his highest total in three years. Returning in time for the 2010 playoffs, he registered one assists in five games as the top-seeded Capitals were eliminated by the Montreal Canadiens in the first round.

Becoming an unrestricted free agent for the third consecutive year in July 2010, Morrison did not initially receive any offers. As a result, he accepted a tryout with the Vancouver Canucks and attended the team&#x27;s training camp in Penticton, British Columbia. At the conclusion of the pre-season, the Canucks offered Morrison a two-way contract, which he turned down. The following day, on October 4, 2010, Morrison was signed by the Calgary Flames to a one-year, one-way contract worth US$725,000. The Flames had signed Morrison in lieu of numerous injuries at the centre position on their roster. He scored his first goal as a Flame on October 16 in a 5–3 win against the Edmonton Oilers. After recording 43 points in 66 games, Morrison suffered a season-ending injury in March 2011. He hurt his left knee in a game against the Chicago Blackhawks when opposing defenceman Niklas Hjalmarsson pinned him against the end-boards. At the time of the injury, Morrison was leading the Flames with a plus-minus rating of +13 while centring the team&#x27;s top line with Jarome Iginla and Alex Tanguay. On July 15, 2011, Morrison came to terms with the Flames on a one-year deal worth US$1.25 million.

On January 27, 2012, Morrison was traded to the Chicago Blackhawks in exchange for defenceman Brian Connelly. At season&#x27;s end, he has not played an NHL game since.

==International play==


Morrison debuted with the Canadian national team at the 2000 IIHF World Championship in Saint Petersburg. He was joined on the team by four other Canucks—Todd Bertuzzi, Adrian Aucoin, Ed Jovanovski and Peter Schaefer. Scoring a goal and three assists over seven games, he helped Canada reach the bronze medal game, where they were defeated 2–1 by Finland. Morrison ranked sixth in team point-scoring and tied for first with Aucoin with a plus-minus rating of +7.

Four years later, Morrison was selected again to the Canadian team for the 2004 IIHF World Championship in Prague and Ostrava, Czech Republic. He was one of two Canucks players on the roster, alongside Matt Cooke. In the gold medal game, Morrison registered an assist, helping Canada to a 5–3 win over Sweden. With seven points in nine games, Morrison ranked third in team scoring, behind Dany Heatley and Daniel Brière.

Morrison made his second consecutive tournament appearance at the 2005 IIHF World Championship in Vienna and Innsbruck, Austria. He was named to the team alongside Canucks teammate Ed Jovanovski. Due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, all NHL players were available to participate as there was no timing conflict with the Stanley Cup playoffs. Reaching the gold medal game for the second consecutive year, Canada was shut-out by the Czech Republic, 3–0. Morrison ranked third on the team in goal-scoring with four; he had no assists.

Several months later, Morrison was invited to Canada&#x27;s Olympic Orientation Camp in August 2005—a part of the selection process for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. He was a late addition, replacing Mario Lemieux, who chose not to attend due to commitments with his club team, the Pittsburgh Penguins. Morrison was not chosen to the final roster.

==Personal life==
Morrison was born in Pitt Meadows, British Columbia, to Ron and Deborah Morrison. He has a sister named Jennifer. His parents had moved to Pitt Meadows from Windsor, Ontario, in the 1970s. Ron coached his son on minor hockey teams, before Morrison moved away from home at age 17 to play junior hockey in Penticton.

Morrison and his wife Erin have one son, Brayden, and three daughters, Makenna, Kailyn and Taylor. During his career with the Vancouver Canucks, Morrison resided year-round with his family in Coquitlam, British Columbia. He spent a year living with his family in Newport Beach, California, during his stint with the Anaheim Ducks.

Morrison currently resides in Calgary, Alberta. Since retirement, he has ventured into business with Geoff Sanderson establishing a company called Breakaway Matting Inc.

He currently hosts a fishing and adventure show, &quot;Reel West Coast,&quot; on CHEK TV-DT and YouTube. On the show he is often joined by former Vancouver Canucks and other NHL players.

<text>Le Hocq is an area in the parish of St. Clement, in the south-east of Jersey, Channel Islands. Le Hocq is a Jèrriais name, and means &#x27;the headland&#x27; or &#x27;the cape&#x27; in English.

The fortified Jersey Round Tower at Le Hocq, was built in the 1780s.

Alongside the tower is the Millennium Cross of St. Clement, one of twelve granite wayside crosses erected to mark the millennium in 2000-2001.

The headland juts out onto the rocky Le Hocq Beach (a part of St. Clement&#x27;s Bay). King&#x27;s Rock, Queen&#x27;s Rock and Prince&#x27;s Rock are sizeable rocky outcrops which form a rough number 7 shape. The peaks of King&#x27;s and Queen&#x27;s Rock are vegetated - mostly grass and hardy small plants, and on all of these rocks are evidence of bird (likely seagull) settlement - eggshells and feathers have been found on Prince&#x27;s Rock. All of these rocks are scalable, though with some difficulty, and should not be attempted unless you know what you are doing. King&#x27;s Rock, the tallest, would not measure more than fifteen or twenty metres high.

The rest of the beach, stretching east, is sandy, but with many rockpools, with opportunities for winkle picking and shrimp catching close to the shore, and more serious fishing pursuits out at sea. Closer to land there are stony patches. Just below Le Hocq Tower, west of the groyne of boulders, is a more pleasant sandy beach, which stretches round the headland to a very stony stretch of beach which reaches as far as Rocqueberg (Witches&#x27; Rock) and La Motte (Green Island).

Behind the beach there is the common, broken in two by the slip which runs from la Grande Route de la Côte (the coast road) to the beach. On the slip are small boats, and a little refreshment kiosk.
Further inland is the parish hall (Salle Paroissiale) of St. Clement, and then a meadow featuring an original railway bridge from the days of the Jersey Railway, and a small brook which is unfortunately silted up for much of the year, before reaching Le Rocquier secondary school. Just across the road from the beach is Le Hocq Pub - open for drinks and meals all year round, and then La Rue du Hocq continues all the way up as far as the St. Clement inner road.

Le Hocq tower is depicted on the 2010 issue Jersey 1 pound note.

<text>The 2003 United States Grand Prix (formally the XXXII SAP United States Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 28 September 2003 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana. It was the fifteenth and penultimate race of the 2003 Formula One World Championship and the fourth United States Grand Prix at Indianapolis. Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher won the 73-lap race after starting seventh. McLaren&#x27;s Kimi Räikkönen finished second from a pole position start, with Sauber&#x27;s Heinz-Harald Frentzen third, his first podium finish in three years and his last.

Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship before the race, with Williams leading his team Ferrari in the World Constructors&#x27; Championship. Räikkönen began from pole position after setting the fastest qualifying lap in the second qualifying session. He led for the first 18 laps before making a pit stop for rain tyres due to changing weather conditions. Six different drivers shared the race lead throughout the race due to changing weather conditions. Michael Schumacher overtook British American Racing (BAR) driver Jenson Button to take the lead on lap 38, holding it for the rest of the race to claim his sixth victory of the season and the 70th of his career.

The race result increased Michael Schumacher&#x27;s lead in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship to nine points over Räikkönen, while Williams driver Juan Pablo Montoya remained third but could no longer win the title because he finished sixth following a collision with Schumacher&#x27;s teammate Rubens Barrichello that earned him a drive-through penalty. Ferrari retook the World Constructors&#x27; Championship lead from Williams with a three-point advantage. McLaren were another 16 points behind with one race remaining in the season.

==Background==
The 2003 United States Grand Prix was the penultimate round of the 2003 Formula One World Championship, held on 28 September 2003, at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS) road course in Speedway, Indiana, north of Indianapolis. It was the fourth United States Grand Prix held at Indianapolis, which had previously hosted the Indianapolis 500 as part of the Formula One World Championship from to , since the race returned to the series in 2000 after a nine-year absence. The Porsche Supercup held support races during the weekend.

Following his victory at the two weeks earlier, Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 82 points, three ahead of Williams driver Juan Pablo Montoya in second and another four ahead of McLaren&#x27;s Kimi Räikkönen in third. Montoya&#x27;s teammate Ralf Schumacher was fourth with 58 points and Ferrari&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello was fifth with 55 points. With two races left in the season and 10 points on offer for victory, Michael Schumacher could take his record-breaking sixth world title if he won, Räikkönen was third and Montoya sixth. Even if Montoya won the season-ending , Schumacher would be the champion if he scored no more points, having won more races than Montoya. Williams led the World Constructors&#x27; Championship with 141 points, four more than Ferrari in second. McLaren were third with 120 points. Renault were fourth with 79 points, with British American Racing (BAR) fifth with 18 points.

Following the Italian Grand Prix on 14 September, all teams tested at various European racing tracks in preparation for the United States Grand Prix. McLaren, Renault and Toyota all tested for two days at Spain&#x27;s Circuit de Catalunya, while Williams and Jordan tested for three days at England&#x27;s Silverstone Circuit. Ferrari did three days of testing at the Circuito de Jerez in Spain, with Sauber joining on the first two days, BAR on the final two days and Toyota on all four days. Minardi conducted a comparison test between its PS03 vehicle and the outdated Arrows A23 car at the Mugello Circuit in Italy. Toyota&#x27;s Olivier Panis spent a day at France&#x27;s Circuit Paul Ricard testing aerodynamic modifications on the TF103 car. Ferrari shook down the F2003-GA&#x27;s electronic components and its setup at the Monza Circuit and its private Fiorano Circuit in Italy.

Michael Schumacher was the bookmakers&#x27; favourite to win the race. He said his team were prepared for the event and were motivated more after winning in Italy, adding: &quot;Every tiny error has its consequences. Whoever is able to exploit the resources during the weekend will come out on top.&quot; Montoya felt convinced his car would perform well at Indianapolis because its engine was suited for IMS&#x27;s main straight, and he anticipated a close duel with his championship rivals. He told reporters that he did not have to win the Grand Prix, just finish ahead of Michael Schumacher and Räikkönen to become World Champion in Japan. Räikkönen noted he had not yet finished a race at Indianapolis but said McLaren needed to attempt to be faster than Michael Schumacher and Montoya. He stated that the MP4-17D&#x27;s characteristics would be better suited at Indianapolis than at Monza, and that he needed a strong finish late in the season to remain in contention for the championship.

The Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile&#x27;s (FIA; Formula One&#x27;s governing body) president Max Mosley warned Ferrari, Williams, and McLaren and their drivers that any evidence of team orders in Indianapolis following their ban in October 2002 due to Barrichello being ordered to let teammate Michael Schumacher win the would be referred to the race stewards for thorough analysis. Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn argued that a driver who is not in championship contention should not interfere with another driver who is. Williams technical director Patrick Head stated that the team would let his drivers pass each other rather than the squad. McLaren owner Ron Dennis predicted that team orders would not be an issue in the final two races, expecting that teammates would help each other in the championship battle.

Because most teams were concentrating on the season, they did not make significant changes to their cars for the event. The three championship-contending teams in Ferrari, Williams and McLaren were the expectations. BMW and Ferrari brought enhanced versions of their engines as well as different aerodynamic car appendage changes. McLaren also made minor aerodynamic changes, and BAR was the only non-front-running team to bring an important innovation. Honda, BAR&#x27;s engine supplier, presented an upgraded power unit and a new gearbox.

The event included ten constructors, each with two race drivers. Allan McNish (Renault), Björn Wirdheim (Jordan) and Gianmaria Bruni (Minardi) were the three drivers who drove a third car in only the Friday private test session. Ralph Firman returned to Jordan after Zsolt Baumgartner replaced him for the previous two rounds due to an inner ear imbalance Firman got in an accident during practice for the two races earlier. BAR&#x27;s Jenson Button was cleared to compete after a high-speed crash during testing in Jerez that forced him to visit a London hospital for a check-up. Ralf Schumacher returned to Williams after missing the Italian race due to a headache suffered during a test session at Monza, replacing test driver Marc Gené.

== Private test session ==
Teams that choose limited testing during the season were given a two-hour test session on Friday morning. The session took place in dry, cool weather, with a hint of drizzle in the second hour but not enough to disrupt operations. Renault&#x27;s Jarno Trulli set the fastest lap time of 1:10.986, just 0.001 second faster than teammate Fernando Alonso. McNish was third, with Jaguar&#x27;s Mark Webber fourth and Justin Wilson fifth. Some drivers went off the circuit during testing. A rubber seal came out of a crack between two concrete slabs on the main straight 19 minutes into the session, necessitating a four-minute stoppage to allow marshals to clear the debris.

== Practice and warm-up sessions ==
There were three practice sessions preceding Sunday&#x27;s race: one 60-minute session on Friday morning and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday morning. The FIA moved the start time of all Saturday&#x27;s events by an hour to better accommodate world television viewers due to the title duel. The area was cloudy as the first session began, and everyone wanted to get some running done as soon as possible. The rain fell steadily and intensified halfway through practice, and the FIA permitted teams to run extreme rain tyres to prepare for a probable wet-weather race. Trulli lapped fastest at 1:11.153, 0.186 seconds quicker than Ralf Schumacher in second. Panis, Barrichello, Michael Schumacher, Alonso, Webber, Montoya, Räikkönen and his teammate David Coulthard followed in the top ten. Jordan&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella&#x27;s engine failed on the exit of turn 12 and spilled oil onto the banked turn 13 after 22 minutes, stopping practice. His car stopped on the main straight with smoke billowing from it, prompting its removal from the circuit to the pit lane and oil cleaning by marshals. The work took almost 20 minutes to allow the session to resume. Fisichella&#x27;s teammate Firman stopped in the gravel at the exit of turn ten towards the session&#x27;s end.

The second practice session was held on a circuit in cool, overcast weather with damp parts due to nighttime rain and electrical thunderstorms. The sun later shined on the circuit and it began drying. Trulli maintained his pace with a lap of 1:12.408, ahead of Ralf Schumacher, Montoya, Barrichello, Alonso, Toyota&#x27;s Cristiano da Matta, Panis, Sauber&#x27;s Heinz-Harald Frentzen and the Jaguar pair of Webber and Wilson. A fuel pressure issue caused Michael Schumacher to stop his Ferrari on his installation lap at turn nine two minutes into the session and marshals removed the car from the track. Air and track temperatures rose for the final practice session. Barrichello&#x27;s lap of 1:11.112 was fastest, 0.012 seconds faster than second-placed Trulli. Michael Schumacher, Montoya, Coulthard, Räikkönen, Panis, Webber, Ralf Schumacher and Alonso were in positions three through ten. Ralf Schumacher outbraked himself into turn eight, slid through the wet grass, and damaged his car&#x27;s right side hitting the tyre wall. The waving of yellow flags briefly disrupted on-circuit activities. Da Matta&#x27;s engine failed going through turn 12, laying oil across that corner and the pit lane entry.

Alonso set the quickest lap time of 1:12.079 in the 15-minute warm-up session that preceded the final qualifying session in partly cloudy weather, followed by Montoya, Panis, Räikkönen, Barrichello, Da Matta, Coulthard, Ralf Schumacher and Webber. Trulli&#x27;s Renault suffered front and right-hand damage in two minor crashes with the turn 11 tyre wall late in the session.

== Qualifying ==
There were two one-hour qualifying sessions on both Friday and Saturday afternoons. The World Drivers&#x27; Championship standings determined the running order for the first session (first to last), with the second reversed (slowest to quickest). In each session, each driver recorded one timed lap with no other cars on track, and the starting order was set by the quickest laps in the second session. The circuit was entirely dry, with all tyre rubber removed after the rain shower in the first practice session. Rain began to fall on IMS halfway through the first qualifying session and intensified, prompting drivers to be cautious; the FIA allowed extreme rain tyres to be used for the rest of qualifying. Michelin-shod cars were more competitive in the session than Bridgestone-shod cars because their new front tyres performed better in cooler temperatures. Trulli, who was fastest in the infield section, took provisional pole position with a lap of 1:09.566 with Barrichello 0.269 seconds slower in second. Webber was unaffected by the rain and pished hard to go third. Ralf Schumacher was fourth after braking too late for the first corner due to understeer. Montoya, fifth, braked too soon for some turns, losing time. Coulthard, sixth, went sideways through turn 13 before starting his lap. Alonso was hampered by understeer that was better dealt with on a low fuel load and was seventh. Michael Schumacher ran wide at the exit of turn one and took eighth. Räikkönen, ninth, lost control of his car early in his lap, while Button, tenth, was the last driver unaffected by the rain. Da Matta was the faster Toyota in 11th, ahead of Fisichella&#x27;s Jordan in 12th due to the circuit being slightly wet on the latter&#x27;s lap. Frentzen finished 13th on dry tyres after much of the track got wet halfway through his lap. Panis, 14th, saw the rain get heavier on his lap. The change in conditions caught out Sauber&#x27;s Nick Heidfeld and BAR&#x27;s Jacques Villeneuve, who came 15th and 16th, respectively. Firman&#x27;s team, 17th, put extreme rain tyres on his car. Wilson was 18th, ahead of Minardi&#x27;s Nicolas Kiesa, who came 19th in his first wet Formula One session. Kiesa&#x27;s teammate Jos Verstappen was the only driver to not set a lap time due to a traction control system interface issue between the electronic control unit and the engine. Minardi called Verstappen into the pit lane to abandon his qualifying lap.

The second qualifying session was held in dry, warm, partly cloudy conditions. Räikkönen was the 12th driver to set a time, and his lap of 1:11.670 earned him his second career pole position. He was joined on the grid&#x27;s front row by Barrichello, who was 0.124 seconds slower. Panis had a clean effort and his engine meant he achieved Toyota&#x27;s best qualifying result at the time in third. Montoya clipped a kerb, oversteered for most of the lap, and tyre fading cost him three-tenths of a second and dropped him to fourth. Excessive oversteer left Montoya&#x27;s teammate Ralf Schumacher in fifth, losing control of his car at turn one after finishing his lap. Alonso in sixth had handling problems that saw him oversteer and understeer in the track&#x27;s turns. Michael Schumacher&#x27;s Ferrari lacked grip and had handling issues as he appeared to commit small driver errors en route to seventh. A minor oversteer in turn four and understeer in turn eight left Coulthard eighth. Da Matta drove the spare Toyota setup for him after his engine overheated during the warm-up session. He hit the kerbs to increase speed and took ninth. Trulli&#x27;s car was rebuilt by the Renault mechanics and he made minor errors on his lap, leaving him 10th. Button and Villeneuve of BAR qualified 11th and 12th, respectively, with the team adjusting their setups to improve the driveability and grip of their cars. Heidfeld was 13th when his tyres began graining at the end of his lap. Webber&#x27;s Jaguar lacked grip and balance due to his car carrying a heavy fuel load, causing him to understeer and come 14th. Frentzen, 15th, ran wide in turn six and lost time. Wilson&#x27;s car suffered understeer due to the changing track conditions, and he qualified 16th. Jordan teammates Fisichella and Firman finished 17th and 18th, respectively, due to a lack of grip in their rain setup cars. Minardi teammates Verstappen (19th) and Kiesa (20th) completed the starting order, with both cars carrying a heavy fuel load, resulting in significant oversteer and poor rear-end handling.

=== Qualifying classification ===
== Race ==
The race began at 13:00 local time before an estimated 120,000 spectators. A brief rain shower began falling on the circuit before the race and suddenly developed to heavier rain with hail stones, making the track damp before drying up. The weather was cloudy with the ambient temperature at and the track temperature ; a 30 percent chance of rain was forecast. Every driver started on dry-weather compound tyres. When the five red lights went out to begin the race from its standing start, Räikkönen made a clean start to hold the lead into turn one. Panis passed the slow-starting Barrichello to go third to second as the latter had an automatic gearchange upshift glitch that prompted him to change gears manually. In turn nine, Kiesa collided with Firman&#x27;s rear and had an unscheduled pit stop for a replacement front wing. Michael Schumacher moved from seventh to fourth, while Montoya slid from fourth to seventh before the first lap&#x27;s end.

Räikkönen led Panis by 1.6 seconds at the end of lap one, with Ralf Schumacher third. Coulthard overtook Barrichello on the inside at turn one for fifth. Light rain began falling on parts of the track on the second lap. Ralf Schumacher used the better horsepower of his engine to pass Panis for second on the main straight to begin lap three. Montoya was close behind Barrichello and went to the inside of him after braking for the complex of turns following the main straight. In turn two, they were alongside each other when Montoya was pushed onto the kerb by Barrichello. This saw Montoya&#x27;s right front wheel and Barrichello&#x27;s left rear wheel collide, sending Barrichello into the gravel trap and into retirement. Montoya fell to eighth, behind both Renaults. He overtook Trulli for seventh on lap four as Michael Schumacher gained on Panis.

At the start of lap five, Michael Schumacher moved out of Panis&#x27;s slipstream and overtook him on the inside of the main straight&#x27;s centre into turn one for third. As he finished the overtake, yellow flags were being waved at turns one and two to help remove Barrichello&#x27;s car from the gravel. After McLaren checked camera evidence, Dennis talked with the race director regarding the pass, but the FIA stewards did not penalise Michael Schumacher with a drive-through penalty, ruling that he completed the manoeuvre shortly before entering the yellow flag zone. McLaren and Williams did not protest the decision. On the same lap, the rain intensified, allowing Alonso to pass Coulthard for fifth. Panis was the first front runner to make a pit stop for intermediate tyres at the end of lap six as the rain became harder. Panis fell to 15th after being seven seconds slow leaving his pit stall.

An error by Alonso dropped him behind Coulthard and Montoya on that lap. Michael Schumacher was passed for third on the inside on the main straight by Coulthard on lap seven, as his Bridgestone grooved tyres performed worse than the Michelins in the changing track conditions. Soon after, Montoya attempted an unsuccessful overtake on Michael Schumacher. Montoya overtook Michael Schumacher for fourth place on the outside of the banked turn 13 on lap seven, as the rain began to ease slightly. Michael Schumacher then lost fifth to Alonso. The track began to dry from lap eight, when the stewards announced Montoya was being investigated for his third lap incident with Barrichello and perhaps passing a slower car in yellow flags. Drivers who made pit stops for rain tyres made further pit stops to switch to dry compound tyres as the track dried.

Ralf Schumacher began closing up on race leader Räikkönen on lap 10, pulling to within a second of him by the 14th lap. Coulthard, Montoya and Alonso were close behind each other as all three duelled for third with the circuit now completely dry. Michael Schumacher set the race&#x27;s fastest lap of 1:11.473 on lap 13. On lap 15, Montoya overtook Coulthard for third at turn one, before Alonso passed Coulthard for fourth three turns later. Ralf Schumacher made his first scheduled pit stop at the end of that lap. He rejoined the track in 12th. During lap 17, Coulthard was pressured by Michael Schumacher between turns two and three. Montoya and Coulthard made their first pit stops for fuel and tyres when the lap ended. Montoya lost time when the refuelling hose nozzle failed to attach the first time, necessitating a switch to a backup system. He fell behind Coulthard and into 11th.

On lap 18, light rain returned to the circuit before intensifying on the next lap. This made cars difficult to drive, and team managers tried to mitigate the effects of the changing conditions by predicting whether the track would remain wet or dry. Alonso, Räikkönen and Michael Schumacher made pit stops to remain on dry-weather tyres over laps 18 to 20. Because of the activity in the pit lane, Webber led the race for two laps, with Button second and Wilson third as the rain continued to get heavier. On lap 21, Button lost control of his car on the wet track, and Wilson moved into second place as drivers began stopping for rain tyres. Michael Schumacher, who had proposed switching to rain tyres during his first pit stop, was asked by Brawn to enter the pit lane for intermediate tyres on lap 22. After analysing video footage, the stewards imposed a drive-through penalty on Montoya after deciding that he caused the crash with Barrichello.

Ralf Schumacher stayed on the track for one extra lap due to a radio miscommunication with his team. He lost traction on the wet grass and crashed backwards into the turn eight tyre barrier. He retired the car with rear suspension damage on the turn&#x27;s run-off area. Webber&#x27;s visibility was limited due to his visor steaming up, and he lost control of his Jaguar on dry tyres. He hit the turn eight tyre barrier with his car&#x27;s front and retired. Montoya served his drive-through penalty on lap 22 while Coulthard led one lap before going off the track. Button and Frentzen gained the most from the rain since they had switched to rain tyres at their first pit stops and held first and second, with Michael Schumacher gaining on the leaders. On lap 23, Montoya went off the circuit at turn eight and onto the grass before another pit stop for the full rain tyres, dropping to 11th. Button began pulling away from Frentzen in second as the Bridgestone tyres outperformed the Michelins in the wet. Wilson dropped from third to sixth in three laps when Räikkönen, Michael Schumacher and Alonso passed him.

On lap 28, Michael Schumacher overtook Räikkönen at the end of the back straight into turn eight for third as the rain subsided. Panis lost control of his Toyota and crashed into the turn seven tyre wall two laps later, ending his race. Coulthard continued to drive on dry tyres after going off the track at turn eight on lap 32. During lap 33, Michael Schumacher caught Frentzen and overtook him without much defence at the end of the back straight for second place so that he could begin closing up to race leader Button. He ran off the racing line at the next corner but remained in second. Heidfeld passed Alonso at turn eight for fifth two laps later. Michael Schumacher closed up to Button and overtook him on the inside for the race lead at turn one on lap 38. He began to gradually pull away from Button as drivers began making more pit stops to change to the dry compound tyres. On lap 42, Button pulled over to the side of the main straight with smoke billoiwing from his engine due to a loss of hydraulic pressure, something BAR were aware of but were unable to rectify. His retirement promoted Frentzen to second position, Heidfeld to third and Räikkönen to fourth. Smoke billowed from Alonso&#x27;s engine between turns eight and nine, forcing him to retire on lap 47. Michael Schumacher made his third pit stop for fuel and dry tyres at the end of lap 48, giving Frentzen the race lead.

Frentzen made his second pit stop for fuel and tyres at the conclusion of the 49th lap and rejoined the race in third. Coulthard retired in the McLaren garage one lap later with a gearbox control unit failure. Heidfeld made his final pit stop on lap 51, dropping to fourth and moving teammate Frentzen to second and Räikkönen to third, who was closing in on Frentzen. Firman lost control of his car in turn seven on the 53rd lap after hitting a plastic kerb at turn seven. He retired from the race due to front wheel and fuel problems. Fisichella&#x27;s slower car delayed Frentzen, allowing Räikkönen to reduce the gap and overtake him on the inside into turn one for second at the start of lap 55. Eight laps later, Trulli caught and overtook Heidfeld for fourth. Villeneuve retired from the race on lap 66, with smoke and fire erupting from the rear of his car into turn eight, ending a possible duel with Wilson for eighth. Two laps later, Montoya used Heidfeld&#x27;s slipstream to pass Fisichella for sixth.

Michael Schumacher led the final 24 laps to earn his sixth victory of the season and the 70th of his career. Räikkönen came in second 18.2 seconds later, and Frentzen finished third, his first podium result since the 2000 United States Grand Prix. Trulli was fourth, while Heidfeld finished fifth, his best result of the season. Montoya finished a lap down in sixth, ahead of Fisichella in seventh, his second points finish of the season after winning the . Despite driving over a Jaguar mechanic during a pit stop, Wilson finished eighth, earning him his first career championship point. Da Matta finished ninth after serving a drive-through penalty handed by the stewards for speeding in the pit lane. The Minardi team of Verstappen and Kiesa finished in 10th and 11th, four laps down. The attrition rate was high, with just 11 of the 20 starters finishing the race.

===Post-race===
The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and spoke to the media in the subsequent press conference. Michael Schumacher admitted that tyres played a role in the final result and stated that he was not surprised to finish in the top three because he knew he would gain positions regardless of his starting position. Räikkönen said he lost the race due to changing weather conditions and admitted he was slightly disappointed to finish second, adding, &quot;I was fighting as much as I could. We only got second place. Of course, it&#x27;s not the best, because Michael won, and we came second for the championship.&quot; Frentzen was ecstatic to finish third despite the fact that frequent podium finishes were not his team&#x27;s goal for the season, and he stated he decided to ask his team to swap to wet-weather tyres after glancing at the sky and predicting a long period of rain.

Because he was upset over being eliminated from title contention, Montoya did not talk to the press immediately after the race. He said four days later that it took him two days to realise he could not win the championship and that he could have finished second or third without the drive-through penalty. After reviewing video footage of the third lap crash, Barrichello felt he had given Montoya enough room, saying, &quot;I went into the corner and all of a sudden, I felt a bang. I had given him space into Turn 2, running on the outside, just hoping to get better traction.&quot; Trulli blamed his poor qualifying performance on his lack of a better finish, but he felt his car improved throughout the race and he attacked regardless of the conditions. Button called his lap 42 retirement the &quot;worst feeling&quot; in his career, &quot;When things are going well and you suddenly have a problem like that it&#x27;s a nightmare. It&#x27;s four years now and we still haven&#x27;t had a podium.&quot;

According to Michelin motorsport director Pierre Dupasquier, the company needed to improve its rain tyres in the off-season after being slower than Bridgestone tyres in wet conditions, &quot;The lessons learned will help us to strengthen our all-round performance and that will be a great source of motivation.&quot; The weather, according to Brawn, was critical to winning the race, whereas Williams chief operations engineer Sam Michael said his team had made numerous mistakes in their strategy and that they would review them. Wilson was pleased to get his first career points in the race, crediting his eighth-place finish to his team&#x27;s race strategy and pit stops, &quot;It has been a tough few months for me but I knew that my luck would change at some point.&quot; Fisichella stated that his seventh-place finish was positive because Jordan did not anticipate to win points given the car&#x27;s pace and starting position. Verstappen accused Firman of denying him a championship point.

Michael Schumacher&#x27;s victory put him nine points ahead of Räikkönen in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship, with 92 points to the latter&#x27;s 83 points. Montoya was 10 points behind Michael Schumacher, and finishing sixth meant he was mathematically eliminated from title contention. Because both Ralf Schumacher in fourth and Barrichello in fifth failed to finish the race, neither improved their points total. Ferrari retook the World Constructors&#x27; Championship lead with 147 points, three more than previous leaders Williams. McLaren were third with 128 points, with Renault fourth with 84 points. Sauber scored ten points to boost their total to 19, moving them from ninth to fifth with one race of the season remaining.

<text>The University of Southern Maine (USM) is a public university with campuses in Gorham and Portland, Maine. It is the southernmost university in the University of Maine System. It was founded as two separate state universities, Gorham Normal School and Portland University. The two universities, later known as Gorham State College and the University of Maine at Portland, were combined in 1970 to help streamline the public university system in Maine and eventually expanded by adding the Lewiston campus in 1988.

The Portland Campus is home to the Edmund Muskie School of Public Service, the Bio Sciences Research Institute, the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute and the Osher Map Library, and the USM School of Business. The Gorham campus, much more residential, is home to the School of Education and Human Development and the School of Music. 

==History==
Evolving from Gorham Academy into an institution of higher education, USM originated in 1878 as Gorham Normal School, later called Gorham State Teachers College and then Gorham State College. In 1970 that institution merged with the University of Maine at Portland (previously Portland Junior College) and became the University of Maine at Portland-Gorham (UMPG). The name was changed to University of Southern Maine in 1978. The Lewiston-Auburn campus was founded in 1988.

=== Leadership ===
William J. MacLeod served as president from 1970 until 1971. Louis J.P. Calisti served as president from 1971 until 1973. Walter P. Fridinger served as president in 1973. N. Edd Miller served as president from 1973 until 1978. Kenneth W. Allen served as president from 1978 until 1979. Robert L. Woodbury served as president from 1979 until 1986. Patricia R. Plante served as president from 1987 to 1991. Richard Pattenaude served as president from 1991 until 2007. Joe Wood served as interim president from 2007 to 2008. Selma Botman served as president from 2008 until 2012. Theodora J. Kalikow served as interim president from 2012 until 2014. Former power company CEO David Flanagan served as interim president from 2014 until 2015. Glenn Cummings, former speaker of the Maine House, served as president from 2015 until 2022. Jacqueline Edmondson became the 14th president of the University of Southern Maine in July 2022.

==Campuses==
===Portland===
The Portland campus is located in the Oakdale neighborhood. The primary academic areas at the Portland campus are business, nursing, history, political science, economics, sociology, biology, physics, chemistry, math, english, psychology, media studies, modern and classical languages and literatures, and American and New England studies. The campus houses the Wishcamper Center, the Osher Map Library and Smith Center for Cartographic Education, Hannaford Hall, Luther Bonney Hall, Masterton Hall, the Science Building, the Southworth Planetarium, Payson Smith Hall, Abromson Community Education Center, the Alumni House, and the Sullivan Gymnasium complex. Many department offices are located around the perimeter of the campus center in converted multi-story homes as well as in the major buildings.

In 2021, the university removed the Woodbury Campus Center and broke ground on the 210,000 square foot, 580-bed Portland Commons dorm, which opened in August 2023. It has 385 studios, single, double and four-person apartments with views of the city and Casco Bay. The dorm is open to USM upperclassmen, USM graduate students, University of Maine School of Law students and Southern Maine Community College upperclassmen.

The McGoldrick Center for Career &amp; Student Success and the adjacent Bean Green grassy quad also opened to students in August 2023. The McGoldrick Center includes a dining hall, a career center, and multiple student lounges. Across the street from the dorm is a 500-space parking garage, which is the largest Level Two charging station in Maine with 58 electric vehicle charging stations and storage for more than 250 bicycles. The buildings were built with green building techniques. Portland Commons is the second largest passive house building at an American university.

In 2023, the university broke ground on the $63 million Crewe Center for the Arts with an art gallery, a visual arts teaching space, and a performing arts center able to seat 210 people. It is located between Payson Smith and Luther Bonney.

The student-run community radio station WMPG and the student-run newspaper &quot;The Free Press&quot; are located on the Portland campus.

The campus is adjacent to Noyes Park, a three-quarter acre landscaped park with large shade trees, and near Fesenden Park, Baxter Boulevard park, and Deering Oaks. The USM Portland campus is bordered by I-295, with on and off-ramps accessing the campus on Forest Avenue, and is across the street from a Hannaford grocery store and near restaurants and bars, which include The Great Lost Bear.

==== Glickman Library ====
The Albert Brenner Glickman Family Library is the main library, located on the Portland campus. It includes the Osher Map Library. It houses the Jean Byers Sampson Center for Diversity in Maine, where the current collections represent the African American, Jewish, and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender communities. The library also has rare book collections, including holdings in pre-20th century New England textbooks.

===Gorham===

Gorham is home to most of the university&#x27;s dormitories and competitive athletic facilities. The primary academic areas residing in Gorham are industrial technologies, engineering, art, music, theater, counseling and education, anthropology, geography, environmental sciences, and geosciences. McLellan House, built in 1773, was acquired by Gorham State College in 1966. It was converted into dormitories and later into office space. The Academy Building was built in 1803 and purchased by the university in 1878.

Residence Halls located on the Gorham campus include:
*Woodward Hall
*Dickey and Wood Towers: Dickey and Wood Towers are twin, circular towers that were opened in 1970 and formerly inaugurated in 1973. They can house 380 students. They are named after Edna Dickey, who taught history at the university from 1945–1972 as well as serving as Dean of Women from 1945–69 and Esther Wood, who taught social sciences from 1930–1973. USM proposed mothballing the two towers to save $400,000 in 2014. The dorms were closed in 2015. In 2023, Portland Emergency Shelter Assessment Committee asked about using the empty dorms as temporary shelters for asylum seekers and other unhoused people. The university said the buildings need $40 million in asbestos abatement and rehabilitation. The university plans to demolish the dorms.
*Upton Hall and Hastings Hall: Upton Hall and the adjacent Hastings Hall are named after Ethelyn Upton and Mary Hastings, both of whom were prominent faculty. Upton Hall, home of the university health center and Residential Life Office, was opened in 1960. Hastings Hall opened in 1968. Together, the complex can house up to 300 students.
*Anderson Hall
*Robie Andrews Hall: Robie Hall is named after former Maine Governor Frederick Robie, who served from 1883 to 1887. It was built in 1897 to replace a female-only dormitory which had burnt down in 1894.
*Phillipi Hall: Opened in 2001. Philippi hall also houses USM&#x27;s new Pioneer Program.
*Upperclass Hall (completed fall of 2007)

== Student life ==

=== Dining service ===
Sodexo operates the dining halls. In the fall of 2022, Sodexo introduced delivery robots that carry food to students on both the Gorham and the Portland campuses. The robots are called Kiwibots and have special tires to work in the snow. Students must download an app to use the service. The robots can deliver Starbucks lattes and falafel from food trucks parked on campus.

The Brooks Dining Hall on the Gorham campus was renovated in 2019 at a cost of $2.5 million allowing it to expand the vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free food. In 2023, the McGoldrick Center opened on the Portland campus. It houses a 300-seat dining hall and the Husky Cafe &amp; Brew Pub.

=== &quot;The Free Press&quot; ===
&quot;The Free Press&quot; is a student-run and funded campus newspaper that was founded in 1972. It publishes a print edition weekly during the academic year, equaling roughly 22 editions a year. The newspaper has a circulation of 3,000. It is an entirely student-run and student-funded newspaper not supported by an academic department. The university does not have a journalism program. In fall 2022, a lack of staff led the newspaper to discontinue updates to its websites and social media and focus on print publications.

=== WMPG ===
WMPG is a community radio station located on the Portland Campus. A mix of USM students and volunteers from the greater Portland community produce all the music and local public affairs programs. It began broadcasting in 1973.

== Controversy ==

=== Parking Revenue Recovery Services ===
In 2023-2024, USM instituted a new parking policy and hired controversial Colorado-based vendor Parking Revenue Recovery Services to administer it. Students reported that the system was prone to errors, it issued tickets to cars doing drop offs, and the company was difficult to communicate with. Some students had parking ticket bills totaling thousands of dollars. Parking tickets issued for $55 for each violation. Both students and community members have complained about the system that is difficult to use.

=== Dining service ===
In 2019, students complained about the dining services. Sodexo operates University of Southern Maine&#x27;s dining halls. It was reported that the &quot;students who prefer a plant-based diet were ditching the meal plan, eating elsewhere or foregoing meals.&quot; In response, the university renovated the Gorham dining hall. The complaints continued. In the spring of 2022, students reported dissatisfaction with the food served by the dining hall, complaining of undercooked meat, overcooked pasta, and a lack of vegetarian options.

===2014 financial problems ===
At the beginning of 2014, administrators at USM announced that the university had found itself in dire financial straits, and would be announcing program closures and faculty layoffs, including long-term just cause faculty and tenured faculty. President Theodora Kalikow and Provost Michael Stevenson announced that four departments would be closed: the Recreation and Leisure Studies Department, the GeoSciences Department, the Arts and Humanities program at Lewiston-Auburn College, and the graduate program American and New England Studies (the Recreation and Leisure Studies closure was later rescinded). A week later, twelve individual faculty members in various departments were informed that they would be laid off effective May 31. As a result of protests led by USM students, the layoffs were rescinded by Kalikow. Later that year, Chancellor Page asked Kalikow for her resignation as USM president.

This process was restarted in October 2014, when Interim President David T. Flanagan (former CEO of a power company) and Provost Joseph McDonnell announced that the three programs targeted for elimination in March would indeed be eliminated, and two more: French and Applied Medical Sciences. In addition, USM faculty were notified that twenty-five departments would have to shed fifty full-time faculty members, whether through retirement or layoffs. In the end, 36 faculty members retired, but since some of them were not in targeted departments, 25 faculty members were fired.

Local business leaders claimed the cuts would impair Maine&#x27;s economy and many faculty, students, staff, and community members disputed administration claims about financial insolvency. Critics claimed that the layoffs were arbitrary and capricious, an attempt to eliminate outspoken faculty critical of administration policies and actions, and in violation of the Faculty Senate governance document and the faculty union&#x27;s Collective Bargaining Agreement. All of the faculty layoffs were immediately challenged through grievances filed by the union against the University of Maine System. Following an investigation, the American Association of University Professors</text><links>

<text>Langenthal is a town and a municipality in the district of Oberaargau in the canton of Bern in Switzerland. On 1 January 2010 the municipality of Untersteckholz merged into the Langenthal. On 1 January 2021 the former municipality of Obersteckholz merged into Langenthal.

Langenthal is an educational, cultural, and economic center for the region of Oberaargau.

== History ==
Archeological evidence suggests that early settlements existed around 4000 B.C. in the Langenthal area. A Hallstatt necropolis with twelve grave mounds has been found at Unterhard. Remnants of two Roman villae have also been identified.

Langenthal is first mentioned in 861, as &quot;marcha in Langatun&quot;, referring to farming estates scattered along the Langete (a tributary of the Murg). The Old High German name &quot;Langatun&quot; is presumably composed of a hydronym &quot;langa-&quot; and the Gaulish element &quot;dunum&quot; &quot;fort&quot; (which had become productive as a suffix in toponyms).
The re-interpretation of the name as including the element &quot;-tal&quot; &quot;valley&quot; dates to c. the 15th century, during which the name is on record as either &quot; Langaten&quot; or &quot; Langental&quot; (the same process can be observed in the case of Murgenthal, earlier &quot;Murgatun&quot;).
In the 12th century Langenthal (now known as &quot;Langaton&quot;) belonged to the territory of the lords of Langenstein. In 1194 the Freiherr founded the Abbey of St. Urban and endowed the Abbey with lands in Langenthal. 
Formerly part of Thunstetten parish, Langenthal was granted its own parish church in 1197.
After the extinction of the Langenstein family in 1212, the Abbey inherited additional lands in the area. The establishment of the Abbey brought agricultural improvements, especially the introduction of an irrigation system to the area. However, the Abbey often came into conflict with the Kyburg Ministerialis (unfree knights in the service of a feudal overlord) family of Luternau. The Luternau family fought the growing power of the Abbey, until 1273-76 when they were obligated to sell their interest in Langenthal to the Abbey. Just a few years later, in 1279, the Abbey, in turn, was forced to give the low court and a fortified house in Langenthal to the Freiherr of Grünenberg to hold as a fief. By the end of the 14th century, the Abbey had regained power and was able to bring the village fully under their control.

Starting in 1313 the Kyburgs held the high court right for the village. When that family died out in 1406, Bern inherited the right to hold the high court. Over the next few years Bern&#x27;s power expanded in Langenthal. In 1415, Langenthal became incorporated into the territory of the Republic of Bern, but it remained under the landlordship and the low court of the monastery. Over the following centuries, the Bernese court slowly eliminated many of the Abbey&#x27;s powers. The Protestant Reformation of 1528 weakened the power of the Abbey slightly, but it continued to collect tithes and appoint the village priest until Bern bought those rights in 1808.

During the 16th century a number of craftsmen and small businesses moved into the growing town. In 1571 Bern granted the right for the town to hold two yearly markets. However, the supply of goods for sale quickly exceeded the capacity of the two yearly markets. In 1613 they built a &quot;Kaufhaus&quot; or market building and started holding weekly markets. The &quot;Kaufhaus&quot; was rebuilt in 1808 and from 1894 until 1992 served as the town hall. By 1616 Langenthal had a series of laws and regulations governing the booming markets and trade in the town. In 1640 Langenthal and Langnau became centers of linen canvas production and export to France, Italy, Spain and Portugal. In 1704 Langenthal became the seat of the Oberaargau canvas dealer&#x27;s guild, which brought together weavers, shopkeepers and traders to protect their interests. The decline of eastern Switzerland&#x27;s linen industry in the 18th century gave Langenthal a further boost, which encouraged to Bern to tighten supervision. Beginning in 1758 the Bernese government started inspecting cloth for quality and controlling who was allowed to sell.

The success of the linen trade helped the town to grow. Even though the Aargau cantonal road bypassed the Langenthal, by 1756 it had grown to a total of 189 households, three taverns, various administrative buildings and a warehouse (dated 1748). 
The market street was paved in 1730 and the Langete was partially covered with stone bridges and new houses. In 1785 a brewery opened in town. A small elite of merchants, lawyers, physicians and pharmacists emerged and turned Langenthal into a center of the liberal and nationalist thought during the early modern era. 
Langenthal had been a subject territory of Berne within the Old Swiss Confederacy since 1415, and tended to support uprisings against the central authorities; during the Swiss peasant war of 1653 Langenthal had supported the peasant uprising, as well as the 1798 French invasion and the liberal Helvetic Republic.
The current municipal coat of arms, three wavy bands in blue on yellow (&quot;Or three Bends wavy Azure&quot;), has been in use since c. 1870, replacing an earlier design in red and silver,
but the use of a flag with a similar design, &quot;yellow and blue with a triple rivulet&quot; (&quot;Sie führen einen Fahnen ist gälb und blaw / In dreyfachen Bach darinnen&quot;) is recorded in a song of c. 1700.

Langenthal&#x27;s location on the road from Bern to Zurich (completed in 1760) and on the Swiss Central Railway line (inaugurated in 1857) spurred industrial development, led by textiles and machines. Municipal water supply was introduced in 1894 and an electric utility began operating in 1896. In 1898, the formerly neighboring municipality of Schoren was incorporated into Langenthal.
Langenthal had a population of 1,327 in 1764; population grew to 2,738 by 1850, and to 4,799 by 1900.
In the 20th century, Langenthal became known for its porcelain manufacture. Langenthal reached a population of 10,000 in 1957, further growing to 13,000 by 1970. The municipality has been officially referring to itself as a town (&quot;Stadt&quot;) since 1997. 
In 2001, Langenthal was twinned with the town of Neviano in southern Italy and with Brig-Glis in the upper Valais.
In 2010, the municipality of Untersteckholz was incorporated into Langenthal.

===Obersteckholz===
Obersteckholz is first mentioned in 1255 as &quot;Stechcholz&quot;.

Obersteckholz was the property of the Baron of Langenstein. In 1194, he founded St. Urban&#x27;s Abbey and granted the village to the Abbey as part of its endowment. It was part of the Abbey&#x27;s court of Langenthal until 1406 when it became part of the Bernese bailiwick of Wangen. Following the 1798 French invasion it became part of the district of Langenthal under the Helvetic Republic. In 1803, after the collapse of the Republic, it became part of the Aarwangen District. The village became an independent municipality in 1831. Until 1790 and again after 1975 Obersteckholz and Untersteckholz shared a single school district.

<text>The Italian Football Federation (, ; FIGC ), known colloquially as (), is the governing body of football in Italy. It is based in Rome and the technical department is in Coverciano, Florence.

It manages and coordinates the Italian football league system. It is also responsible for appointing the management of the Italy national football team (men&#x27;s), women&#x27;s, and youth national football teams. The Italy national futsal team also belongs to the federation.

==History==
The Federation was established in Turin on 26 March 1898 as the Federazione Italiana del Football (FIF), on the initiative of a Constituent Assembly established on 15 March by Enrico D&#x27;Ovidio. Mario Vicary was elected the first official president of the FIF on 26 March.

When, in 1909, it was suggested to change the Federation&#x27;s name at an annual board elections held in Milan, the few teams attending, representing less than 50% of the active clubs, decided to send a postcard asking all teams to vote for the five new names discussed during the meeting. The new name approved was &quot;Federazione Italiana Giuoco del Calcio&quot; (FIGC), and since then has been the name of the Italian Football Federation. The debut of the Men&#x27;s National Team was on 15 May 1910, at Arena Civica, wearing a white jersey where Italy defeated France 6–2. The following year, the blue jersey was introduced on the occasion of the match against Hungary as a tribute to the colour of the House of Savoy.

This Italian Federation was an &quot;amateur&quot; federation respecting FIFA rules when it became a member in 1905. At the end of World War I, the federation had seen impressive development and several footballers were judged to be professional players and banned according to FIFA agreements.
From 1922 to 1926, new and more severe rules were approved for keeping the &quot;amateur&quot; status real and effective, such as footballers&#x27; residence and transfer controls but the best players were secretly paid and moved from other provinces illegally. Foreigners had to live in the country to get a residence visa and a players&#x27; card. When, in 1926, the Italian Federation Board resigned following a very difficult referees&#x27; strike, the fascist Lando Ferretti, president of the Italian Olympic Committee (C.O.N.I.), nominated a Commission to reform all Leagues and federal rules. The Commission signed a document called the &quot;Carta di Viareggio&quot; (Rules issued in Viareggio) where football players were recognised as &quot;non-amateurs&quot; and able to apply for refunds for the money they had lost while playing for the football teams. They had to sign the declaration not being professional players so that FIFA rules were respected because for FIGC; they were appearing as &quot;amateurs&quot; receiving just refunds. It was the beginning of professionalism in Italy.
The Carta di Viareggio reduced the number of foreign players to just one per match so that the majority of Hungarians remained jobless and returned to their country.

Commissioner Bruno Zauli led the FIGC renovation process (1959), with the establishment of three Leagues (Professional, Semi-professional, Amateur) and the creation of the Technical and Youth Sectors.

Between 1964 and 1980, foreign players were banned from the Italian league, primarily to revive the national team.

In December 1998, the FIGC celebrated its centenary at the Stadio Olimpico in a match featuring Italy vs World XI, with Italy winning 6–2.

The FIGC was placed in administration in May 2006 as a result of the 2006 Italian football scandal and was put under the management of Guido Rossi. In May 2006, Rossi was chosen and accepted the role of president of Telecom Italia. This appointment caused angry reactions from club presidents in Italy.
On 19 September, Rossi resigned as Commissioner of FIGC. On 21 September, Luca Pancalli, head of the Italian Paralympic Committee, was chosen to replace Rossi.
On 2 April 2007, a new President was elected, with former Vice-President Giancarlo Abete being voted by 264 grand electors out of 271.

Following the 2014 FIFA World Cup Abete resigned and Carlo Tavecchio was elected president of the Federation and Michele Uva as general manager. The new governance began many reforms on the main aspects of Italian football, particularly through the use of young players trained in Italy, the economic sustainability - financial professional clubs, start the reorganization of the operating structure of the FIGC. In support of the activity and with a view of maximum transparency, the FIGC public a series of documents: Football Report, Integrated Budget (evolution of the Social Report), Management Report, Income Statement of Italian football. On 20 November 2017, Tavecchio resigned as Italian Football Federation president, seven days after Italy failed to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the first time since 1958.

<doc id="682109" wikidata="Q11926847" url="?curid=682109" title="Irish National Invincibles">
<text>The Irish National Invincibles, usually known as the Invincibles, were a militant organisation based in Ireland active from 1881 to 1883. Founded as splinter group of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, the group had a more radical agenda, and was formed with an intent to target those who implemented English policies in Ireland.

==Phoenix Park Murders==
After numerous attempts on his life, Chief Secretary for Ireland William Edward Forster resigned in protest of the Kilmainham Treaty. The Invincibles settled on a plan to kill the Permanent Under Secretary Thomas Henry Burke at the Irish Office. The newly installed Chief Secretary for Ireland, Lord Frederick Cavendish, was walking with Burke on the day of his arrival in Ireland when they struck, in Phoenix Park, Dublin, at 17:30 on 6 May 1882. Joe Brady attacked Burke, followed in short order by Tim Kelly, who knifed Cavendish. Both men used surgical knives.

A large number of suspects were arrested and interrogated by the Dublin Metropolitan Police (DMP). By playing off one suspect against another, Superintendent Mallon of the DMP&#x27;s G Division got several of them to reveal what they knew. The Invincibles&#x27; leader, James Carey, and Michael Kavanagh agreed to testify against the others. Joe Brady, Michael Fagan, Thomas Caffrey, Dan Curley and Tim Kelly were hanged by William Marwood in Kilmainham Gaol in Dublin between 14 May and 4 June 1883. Others were sentenced to long prison terms. No member of the founding executive, however, was ever brought to trial by the British government. John Walsh, Patrick Egan, John Sheridan, Frank Byrne, and Patrick Tynan fled to the United States.

==Aftermath==
Carey was shot dead on board &quot;Melrose&quot; off Cape Town, South Africa, on 29 July 1883, by County Donegal man Patrick O&#x27;Donnell, for giving evidence against his former comrades. O&#x27;Donnell was apprehended and escorted back to London, where he was convicted of murder at the Old Bailey and hanged on 17 December 1883.

A novel about Patrick O&#x27;Donnell has been published with the premise that upon learning of the interventions on his behalf by Victor Hugo, O’Donnell is purported to have written a series of 26 letters to the famous author and humanitarian; letters which never reached their intended recipient but were apparently discovered in 2016 and published in &#x27;The Execution, Life and Times of Patrick O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;. It casts doubt on O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s motives for the murder of Carey.

==In literature and song ==
In Episode Seven of James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;, Stephen Dedalus and other characters discuss the assassinations in the offices of the &quot;Freeman&quot; newspaper. In Episode Sixteen Bloom and Dedalus stop in a cabman&#x27;s shelter run by a man they believe to be James &#x27;Skin-the-Goat&#x27; Fitzharris.

The Invincibles and Carey are mentioned in the folk song &quot;Monto (Take Her Up To Monto)&quot;:

&quot;When Carey told on Skin-the-goat,&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&quot;O&#x27;Donnell caught him on the boat&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&quot;He wished he&#x27;d never been afloat, the filthy skite.&quot; &lt;br&gt; 
&quot;Twasn&#x27;t very sensible&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&quot;To tell on the Invincibles&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&quot;They stood up for their principles, day and night by going up to Monto Monto...&quot;&quot;

<text>Sir James Douglas (also known as Good Sir James and The Black Douglas; – 25 August 1330) was a Scottish knight and feudal lord. He was one of the chief commanders during the Wars of Scottish Independence.

==Early life==
He was the eldest son of Sir William Douglas, known as &quot;le Hardi&quot; or &quot;the bold&quot;, who had been the first noble supporter of William Wallace (the elder Douglas died circa 1298, a prisoner in the Tower of London). His mother was Elizabeth Stewart, the daughter of Alexander Stewart, 4th High Steward of Scotland, who died circa 1287 or early 1288. His father remarried in late 1288 so Douglas&#x27; birth had to be prior to that; however, the destruction of records in Scotland makes an exact date or even year impossible to pinpoint.

Douglas was sent to France for safety in the early days of the Wars of Independence, and was educated in Paris. There he met William Lamberton, Bishop of St. Andrews, who took him as a squire. He returned to Scotland with Lamberton. His lands had been seized and awarded to Robert Clifford. Lamberton presented him at the occupying English court to petition for the return of his land shortly after the capture of Stirling Castle in 1304, but when Edward I of England heard whose son he was he grew angry and Douglas was forced to depart.

==The Douglas Larder==
Douglas&#x27;s actions for most of 1307 and early 1308, although confined for the most part to his native Douglasdale, were essential to keeping the enemy in the South and freeing Bruce to campaign in the north. He soon created a formidable reputation for himself as a soldier and a tactician. While Bruce was campaigning in the north against his domestic enemies, Douglas used the cover of Selkirk Forest to mount highly effective mobile attacks against the enemy. He also showed himself to be utterly ruthless, particularly in his relentless attacks on the English garrison in his own Douglas Castle, the most famous of which quickly passed into popular history. Barbour dates this incident to Palm Sunday 1307, which fell on 19 March. Some question whether this date is too early as Bruce and his small army were not yet established in south-west Scotland, suggesting Palm Sunday 1308 – 17 April – as a more accurate date. However, as Barbour states that at the time of the Douglas Larder the Scots were not yet established in south-west Scotland and indeed that Douglas was the only one of Bruce&#x27;s men anywhere in the area, there is reason to think that Barbour&#x27;s date is probably correct. Barbour says that the Larder was the first act toward becoming established in that part of Scotland.

With the help of his kinsman Thomas Dickson, son of Earl Richard Keith and Castellan of Douglas Castle, Douglas and his small troop were hidden until the morning of Palm Sunday, when the garrison left the battlements to attend the local church. Gathering local support, he entered the church and the war-cry &quot;Douglas! Douglas!&quot; went up for the first time. Some of the English soldiers were killed and others taken prisoner. The prisoners were taken to the castle, now largely empty. All the stores were piled together in the cellar, the wine casks burst open and the wood used for fuel. The prisoners were then beheaded and placed on top of the pile, which was set alight. Before departing, the wells were poisoned with salt and the carcasses of dead horses. The local people soon gave the whole gruesome episode the name &quot;the Douglas Larder.&quot; As an example of frightfulness in war, it was meant to leave a lasting impression, not least upon the men who came to replace their dead colleagues. Further attacks followed by the man now known to the English, according to the poet John Barbour, as &quot;The blak Dowglas&quot;, a sinister and murderous force &quot;mair fell than wes ony devill in hell.&quot;

In August 1308, Douglas met the king for a joint attack on the MacDougalls of Lorn, kinsmen of the Comyns, the climax to Bruce&#x27;s campaign in the north. Two years before, the Macdougalls had intercepted and mauled the royal army at the Battle of Dalrigh. Now they awaited the arrival of their opponents in the narrow Pass of Brander, between Ben Cruachan and Loch Awe in Argyllshire. While Bruce pinned down the enemy in a frontal advance through the pass, Douglas, completely unobserved, led a party of loyal Highlanders further up the mountain, launching a surprise attack from the rear. Soon the Battle of Pass of Brander turned into a rout. Returning south soon after, Douglas joined with Edward Bruce, the king&#x27;s brother, in a successful assault on Rutherglen castle near Glasgow, going on to a further campaign in Galloway.

==Roxburgh Falls==

In the years that followed Douglas was given time to enhance his skills as a soldier. Edward II came north with an army in 1310 in fruitless pursuit of an enemy that simply refused to be pinned down. The frustrations this obviously caused are detailed in the &quot;Vita Edwardi Secundi&quot;, a contemporary English chronicle;

&quot;The king entered Scotland with his army but not a rebel was to be found...At that time Robert Bruce, who lurked continually in hiding, did them all the injury he could. One day, when some English and Welsh, always ready for plunder, had gone out on a raid, accompanied by many horsemen from the army, Robert Bruce&#x27;s men, who had been concealed in caves and woodland, made a serious attack on our men...From such ambushes our men suffered heavy losses. For Robert Bruce, knowing himself unequal to the king of England in strength or fortune, decided it would be better to resist our king by secret warfare rather than dispute his right in open battle.&quot;

Edward was even moved to write to the Pope in impotent fury, complaining that &quot;Robert Bruce and his accomplices, when lately we went into parts of Scotland to repress their rebellion, concealed themselves in secret places after the manner of foxes.&quot;

In the years before 1314 the English presence in Scotland was reduced to a few significant strongholds. There were both strengths and weaknesses in this. The Scots had no heavy equipment or the means of attacking castles by conventional means. However, this inevitably produced a degree of complacency in garrisons provisioned enough to withstand a blockade. In dealing with this problem the Scots responded in the manner of foxes; and among the more cunning of their exploits was Douglas&#x27; capture of the powerful fortress at Roxburgh. His tactic, though simple, was brilliantly effective. On the night of 19/20 February 1314 – Shrove Tuesday and Ash Wednesday – several dark shapes were seen beneath the battlements and mistakenly assumed to be cattle. Douglas had ordered his men to cover themselves with their cloaks and crawl towards the castle on their hands and knees. With most of the garrison celebrating just prior to the fast of Lent, scaling hooks with rope ladders attached were thrown up the walls. Taken by complete surprise the defenders were overwhelmed in a short space of time. Roxburgh Castle, among the best in the land, was slighted or destroyed in accordance with Bruce&#x27;s policy of denying strongpoints to the enemy.

==Bannockburn==

The greatest challenge for Bruce came that same year as Edward invaded Scotland with a large army, nominally aimed at the relief of Stirling Castle, but with the real intention of drawing out Bruce and his men. The Scots army, roughly a quarter the size of the enemy force, was poised to the south of Stirling and prepared to make a quick withdrawal into the wild country to the west. However, their position just north of the Bannock Burn had strong natural advantages, and the king gave orders to suspend for a time the guerrilla tactics pursued hitherto. On the morning of 24 June and prior to battle, Barbour states it was then that Douglas was made a knight. Many now believe that Douglas was made a knight banneret.

The knight banneret was established under Edward I. A knight banneret held no command responsibilities so much as greater honours . A knight banneret fought under his own banner unlike a knight bachelor who was limited to a pennon. In his &quot;The Brus&quot;, John Barbour writes in Book XV that Douglas fought under his own banner, hence Douglas had to be a knight banneret. Barbour does state Douglas and others were knighted on the field of the Battle of Bannockburn, &quot;each in their own degree&quot; which would suggest not all were knights bachelor. Others believe that he was knighted late in his career. There is disagreement on the point.

Traditional Scottish accounts dating from the 1370s state that during the battle, Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray commanded the vanguard, the left wing though nominally led by the young Walter Stewart was commanded by his cousin Douglas, Edward Bruce took the right wing, and King Robert the rearguard. However, contemporary English accounts state that the Scottish army consisted of three units, so the idea that Douglas and Stewart commanded a unit could be a later invention or the English account is simply mistaken.

Once the English army was defeated, Douglas requested the honour of pursuing the fleeing Edward and his party of knights, a task carried out with such relentless vigour that the fugitives, according to Barbour, &quot;had not even leisure to make water&quot;. In the end Edward managed to evade Douglas by taking refuge in Dunbar Castle.

Bannockburn effectively ended the English presence in Scotland, with all strongpoints – outwith Berwick – now in Bruce&#x27;s hands. It did not, however, end the war. Edward had been soundly defeated but he still refused to abandon his claim to Scotland. For Douglas one struggle had ended and another was about to begin.

==Warlord==

Bannockburn left northern England open to attack and in the years that followed many communities in the area became closely acquainted with the &#x27;Blak Dowglas.&#x27; Along with Randolph, Douglas was to make a new name for himself in a war of mobility, which carried Scots raiders as far south as Pontefract and the Humber. But in a real sense this &#x27;war of the borders&#x27; belonged uniquely to Douglas, and became the basis for his family&#x27;s steady ascent to greatness in years to come. War ruined many ancient noble houses; it was the true making of the house of Douglas. The tactics used by Douglas were simple but effective: his men rode into battle – or retreated as the occasion demanded – on small horses known as hobbins, giving the name of &#x27;hobelar&#x27; to both horse and rider. All fighting, however, was on foot. Scottish hobelars were to cause the same degree of panic throughout northern England as the Viking longships of the ninth century.

With the king, Moray and Edward Bruce diverted in 1315 to a new theatre of operations in Ireland, Douglas became even more significant as a border fighter. In February 1316 he won a significant engagement at Skaithmuir near Coldstream with a party of horsemen sent out from the garrison of Berwick. The dead included one Edmond de Caillou Gascon governor of Berwick Castle, and seemingly a nephew of Piers Gaveston, the former favourite of Edward II. Douglas reckoned this to be the toughest fight in which he had ever taken part.

Further successes followed: another raiding party led by Edmund FitzAlan, 9th Earl of Arundel was intercepted and defeated at Lintalee, to the south of Jedburgh; a third group was defeated outside the walls of Berwick, where their leader, Sir Robert Neville, known as the &#x27;Peacock of the North&#x27;, and elder son to Ralph Neville, 1st Baron Neville de Raby, was killed by Douglas in single combat. Such was Douglas&#x27; status and reputation that he was made Lieutenant of the Realm, with the Steward, when Bruce and Moray went to Ireland in the autumn of 1316.

Douglas&#x27; military achievements inevitably increased his political standing still further. When Edward Bruce, the king&#x27;s brother and designated successor, was killed in Ireland at the Battle of Faughart in the autumn of 1318, Douglas was named as Guardian of the Realm and tutor to the future Robert II, after Randolph if Robert should die without a male heir. This was decided at a parliament held at Scone in December 1318, where it was noted that &quot;Randolph and Sir James took the guardianship upon themselves with the approbation of the whole community.&quot;

==Myton and Byland==

In April 1318 Douglas was instrumental in capturing Berwick from the English, the first time the castle and town had been in Scottish hands since 1296. For Edward, seemingly blind to the sufferings of his northern subjects, this was one humiliation too many. A new army was assembled, the largest since 1314, with the intention of recapturing what had become a symbol of English prestige and their last tangible asset in Scotland. Edward arrived at the gates of the town in the summer of 1319, Queen Isabella accompanying him as far as York, where she took up residence. Not willing to risk a direct attack on the enemy, Bruce ordered Douglas and Moray on a large diversionary raid into Yorkshire.

It would appear that the Scottish commanders had news of the Queen&#x27;s whereabouts, for the rumour spread that one of the aims of the raid was to take her prisoner. As the Scots approached York she was hurriedly removed from the city, eventually taking refuge in Nottingham. With no troops in the area, William Melton, Archbishop of York, set about organising a home guard, which of necessity included a great number of priests and other minor clerics. The two sides met up at Myton-on-Swale, with inevitable consequences. So many priests, friars and clerics were killed in the Battle of Myton that it became widely known as the &#x27;Chapter of Myton.&#x27; It was hardly a passage of any great military glory for Douglas but as a strategy the whole Yorkshire raid produced the result intended: there was such dissension among Edward&#x27;s army that the attempt on Berwick was abandoned. It was to remain in Scottish hands for the next fifteen years.

Four years later Edward mounted what was to be his last invasion of Scotland, advancing to the gates of Edinburgh. Bruce had pursued a scorched-earth campaign, denying the enemy essential supplies, so effective that they were forced to retreat by the spur of starvation alone. Once again this provided the signal for a Scottish advance: Bruce, Douglas and Moray crossed the Solway Firth, advancing by rapid stages deep into Yorkshire. Edward and Isabella had taken up residence at Rievaulx Abbey. All that stood between them and the enemy raiders was a force commanded by John de Bretagne, 1st Earl of Richmond, positioned on Scawton Moor, between Rievaulx and Byland Abbey. To dislodge him King Robert used essentially the same tactics as that of Brander in 1308: while Douglas and Moray attacked from the front a party of Highlanders scaled the cliffs on Richmond&#x27;s flank and attacked from the rear. The Battle of Old Byland turned into a rout, and Edward and his queen were forced into a rapid and undignified flight from Rievaulx, the second time in three years that a Queen of England had taken to her heels.

==More raids==
In 1327, the hapless Edward II was deposed in a &quot;coup&quot; led by his wife and her lover, Roger Mortimer, Lord Wigmore. He was replaced by Edward III, his teenage son, though all power remained in the hands of Mortimer and Isabella. The new political arrangements in England effectively broke the truce with the former king, arranged some years before. Once again the raids began, with the intention of forcing concessions from the government.

By mid-summer Douglas and Moray were ravaging Weardale and the adjacent valleys. On 10 July a large English army, under the nominal command of the young king, left York in a campaign that resembles nothing less than an elephant in pursuit of a hare.

The English commanders finally caught sight of their elusive opponents on the southern banks of the River Wear. The Scots were in a good position but declined all attempts to draw them into battle. After a while they left, only to take up an even stronger position at Stanhope Park, a hunting preserve belonging to the bishops of Durham. From here on the night of 4 August Douglas led an assault party across the river in a surprise attack on the sleeping English, later described in a French eyewitness account;

&quot;The Lord James Douglas took with him about two hundred men-at-arms, and passed the river far off from the host so that he was not perceived: and suddenly he broke into the English host about midnight crying &#x27;Douglas!&#x27; &#x27;Douglas!&#x27; &#x27;Ye shall all die thieves of England&#x27;; and he slew three hundred men, some in their beds and some scarcely ready: and he stroke his horse with spurs, and came to the King&#x27;s tent, always crying &#x27;Douglas!&#x27;, and stroke asunder two or three cords of the King&#x27;s tent.&quot;

Panic and confusion spread throughout the camp: Edward himself only narrowly escaped capture, his own pastor being killed in his defence. The Battle of Stanhope Park, minor as it was, was a serious humiliation, and after the Scots outflanked their enemy the following night, heading back to the border, Edward is said to have wept in impotent rage. His army retired to York and disbanded. With no other recourse Mortimer and Isabella opened peace negotiations, finally concluded the following year with the Treaty of Northampton, which recognised the Bruce monarchy and the independence of Scotland.

==Final campaign==


Robert Bruce died in 1329. According to Jean le Bel, when Bruce was dying he asked that Sir James, as his friend and lieutenant, should carry his heart to the Holy Land and present it at the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem as a mark of penance. John Barbour, alternatively, has Bruce ask that his heart should simply be carried in battle against &quot;God&#x27;s foes&quot; as a token of his unfulfilled ambition to go on crusade. Given that Jerusalem had been in Muslim hands since 1187, this second is perhaps more likely. When Bruce was dead, his heart was cut from his body and placed in a silver and enamelled casket which Sir James placed around his neck. Early in 1330, Douglas set sail from Berwick upon Tweed, accompanied by seven other knights with twenty esquires and gentlemen.

The party stopped first at Sluys in Flanders. There it may be that Douglas received confirmation that Alfonso XI of Castile was preparing a campaign against the Muslims of the kingdom of Granada. In anticipation, he had with him a letter of introduction to King Alfonso from Edward III of England, his cousin. Accordingly, the Scots sailed on to Seville, where, according to John Barbour, Sir James and his solemn relic were received by Alfonso with great honour.

Douglas and his company joined Alfonso&#x27;s army, which then was setting out for the frontier of Granada to besiege the castle of Teba. Uthman ibn Abi al-Ula, the Berber general in command of the Moorish forces, marched to relieve the border stronghold. At some point during the siege, Douglas was killed. Sources and commentators differ as to how. According to Jean Froissart and the &quot;Gran Cronica de Alfonso XI&quot;, Douglas was killed as a result of making a premature attack on the enemy. The &quot;Gran Cronica&quot; suggests this might have been during fighting for access to water. Citing John Barbour, some modern commentators believe he died in the decisive Battle of Teba. Barbour describes a grand battle in Spain but the setting is vague and the outcome ambiguous.

According to the &quot;Gran Cronica de Alfonso XI&quot;, Uthman, unable to bring the Christians to battle, devised a stratagem in an attempt to force them to abandon the siege. A body of cavalry was sent to make a diversionary attack across the Guadalteba river, luring Alfonso out to fight while Uthman circled round to attack the Christian camp and destroy the besieging army&#x27;s supplies. Alfonso, however, having received report of Uthman&#x27;s approach, kept most of his army back in camp while he sent a contingent to meet the demonstration on the river. It is as part of this force that some commentators assume Douglas and his company joined the battle. When Uthman arrived at the enemy camp he found Alfonso&#x27;s men armed and ready. He abandoned his attack and rode to support the diversionary force on the river where, unable to withstand the Castilian assault, his men were already starting to fall back.

Uthman arrived too late to prevent a general rout and the entire Granadan force was 
driven back in confusion to their camp in the Turon valley, 10 miles to the south. It is in this phase of the battle that some modern commentators have placed Douglas&#x27; death, either caught in flank when Uthman&#x27;s force reached the river or in the ensuing pursuit to the Granadan camp.

According to John Barbour&#x27;s description of Douglas&#x27; last battle, when the enemy broke, Sir James and his companions followed hard behind. Having outstripped most of his men in the pursuit, Douglas suddenly found himself far out in front with only a few of his followers around him. As they rode back to rejoin the main body, a body of Moors, seizing their opportunity, quickly rallied and counterattacked. When Douglas saw Sir William St. Clair of Rosslyn about to be surrounded and cut off, he led the few knights who were with him to attempt a rescue but, outnumbered twenty to one, the group was overrun. It has become a popular legend that Douglas then took from his neck the silver casket which contained the heart of Bruce and threw it before him among the enemy, saying, &quot;Now pass thou onward as thou wert wont, and Douglas will follow thee or die.&quot; This anecdote has its origin in a 16th-century addition to Barbour&#x27;s poem which, however, describes Douglas making the gesture at the beginning of his final battle. It was Sir Walter Scott in &quot;Tales of a Grandfather&quot; who created the image of Douglas throwing Bruce&#x27;s heart as his dying act.

The Castilian &quot;cronica&quot; makes no reference to such a catastrophe. It does, however, state that in a fierce skirmish some days prior to the climactic battle, an unnamed &quot;foreign count&quot; (arguably a reference to Douglas) had died as a result of his own rash behaviour. This is one of only two battle casualties mentioned individually in the Castilian narrative of the campaign.

Barbour relates that Douglas and all the men caught with him were killed, including Sir William St. Clair of Rosslyn, Sir Robert Logan and Sir Walter Logan. Barbour states that, after this battle, Douglas&#x27; body and the casket with Bruce&#x27;s heart were recovered. His bones, the flesh boiled off them, were taken back to Scotland by Sir William Keith of Galston in Ayrshire (who had missed the battle because of a broken arm), and deposited at St Bride&#x27;s Church. The tradition that Sir Simon Locard was a member of the company and also survived is not found in any of the sources. The heart of Bruce was taken by Moray, the regent, and solemnly interred under the high altar of Melrose Abbey.
The poet and chronicler John Barbour provides us with a pen portrait of the &quot;Black Douglas&quot;, among the first of its kind in Scottish history, which in 1914 was rendered in modern verse translation:

==Succession==
Sir James had two children by unknown mothers:
*William, Lord of Douglas killed 1333 at the Battle of Halidon Hill
**In 1333 succeeded by his uncle, Sir James&#x27; half-brother, Hugh the Dull, Lord of Douglas (c. 1294–1342)
**In 1342 succeeded by Hugh&#x27;s nephew (by Sir James&#x27; youngest half-brother Archibald), William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas, (1327–1384)
*Archibald the Grim (circa 1330–1400), Lord of Galloway succeeded his once removed cousin as Earl of Douglas in 1388.

By 1333 the &#x27;bloody heart&#x27; was incorporated in the arms of Sir James&#x27; son, William, Lord of Douglas. It subsequently appeared, sometimes with a royal crown, in every branch of the Douglas family.

<text>Guilloché (), or guilloche (), is a decorative technique in which a very precise, intricate and repetitive pattern is mechanically engraved into an underlying material via engine turning, which uses a machine of the same name. Engine turning machines may include the rose engine lathe and also the straight-line engine. This mechanical technique improved on more time-consuming designs achieved by hand and allowed for greater delicacy, precision, and closeness of line, as well as greater speed.

The term &quot;guilloche&quot; is also used more generally for repetitive architectural patterns of intersecting or overlapping spirals or other shapes, as used in the Ancient Near East, classical Greece and Rome and neo-classical architecture, and Early Medieval interlace decoration in Anglo-Saxon art and elsewhere. Medieval Cosmatesque stone inlay designs with two ribbons winding around a series of regular central points are very often called guilloche. These central points are often blank, but may contain a figure, such as a rose. These senses are a back-formation from the engraving &quot;guilloché&quot;, so called because the architectural motifs resemble the designs produced by later guilloché techniques.

==Uncertain etymology==
The name guilloché is French, dating back at least to the 1770s, and is often said to be called after a French engineer named Guillot, who invented a tool or turning machine. However no dates nor first name are provided for this shadowy figure, and many dictionaries seem suspicious of his existence.

==History==
Engine turning machines were first used in the 1500–1600s on soft materials such as ivory and wood. In the 18th century they were adopted for metals such as gold and silver. Some accounts give the credit of developing tightly-packed engraved guilloché decoration to the Nuremberg glass-making dynasty of the Schwanhardt family in the 17th century, using a wheel to engrave the glass.

Engine turning machines made of cast iron and heavy wooden bases, with precision machined surfaces were made until circa 1967 (e.g. Neuweiler und Engelsberger). Individuals continue the craft of making these elegant machines, but in limited quantities.

A Guilloche Machine was granted a US Patent in 1968 by Wilhelm Brandstatter. The original assignor was a firm called Maschinenfabrik Michael Kampf KG. A photo of this machine can be seen at Turati Lombardi&#x27;s history page.

In the 1920s and &#x27;30s, automobile parts such as valve covers, which are atop the engine, were also engine-turned. Similarly, dashboards or the instrument panel of the same were often engine-turned. Customizers also would decorate their vehicles with engine-turning panels similarly.

&quot;Guilloche&quot; describes a narrow instance of guilloche: a design, frequently architectural, using two curved bands that interlace in a pattern around a central space. Some dictionaries give only this definition of &quot;guilloche&quot;, although others include the broader meaning associated with guilloché as a second meaning. Note that in the original sense, even a straight line can be guilloché, and persons using the French spelling and pronunciation generally intend the broader, original meaning. Translucent enamel was applied over guilloché metal by Peter Carl Fabergé on the Fabergé eggs and other pieces from the 1880s.

==In today’s terminology==

In consequence of the nature of the design, which is usually a series of lines that are, or look very much like they are interwoven into one another, any design engraved on metal, printed, or otherwise erected on surfaces such as wood or stone, that go in a similar style of constant wriggling that interlock – or look like they are interlocking – with one another, is referred to as guilloché.

Some of the more common ones are the following:

* Engraved (in metal, mainly sterling): in fine timepieces (mainly pocket watches), fine pens, jewelry charms, snuffboxes, hair-styling accessories, wine goblets etc. Examples of famous works of Guilloché are the engravings on Fabergé eggs.
* Erected: on stone for architecture, in wood for styling, on furniture or molding, etc.
* Printed: on bank notes, currency or certificates, etc., to protect against forged copies. The pattern used in this instance is called a spirograph in mathematics, that is, a hypotrochoid generated by a fixed point on a circle rolling inside a fixed circle. It has parametric equations. These patterns bear a strong resemblance to the designs produced on the Spirograph, a children&#x27;s toy.

==Other names for guilloché==
The engine turning machine characteristic of guilloché is called by other names in specific uses:
* Rose engine (metalwork)
* Straight line engine turning &quot;Tour à guilloché&quot; (metalwork)
* Holtzapffel lathe, named after the founder of an ornamental lathe manufacturer John Jacob Holtzapffel
* Decoration lathe (metalwork)
* Damaskeening (watch movements and horology)
* Geometric lathe (security printing)
* Cycloidal engine (security printing)
* Ornamental turning or ornamental lathe (woodcarving).

The different types of the machines refer to different models and different times during the development of the engine-turning machine.

<text>Roswell Pettibone Flower (August 7, 1835May 12, 1899) was an American politician who served as the 30th governor of New York from 1892 to 1894. He also served two terms in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1881 to 1883 (NY-11) and from 1889 to 1891 (NY-12).

==Biography==
He was born on August 7, 1835, to Nathan Monroe Flower and Mary Ann Flower, the sixth of nine children. As a youth, he worked in odd jobs, which enabled him to cover the cost of his education at a local village school. He graduated from high school in 1851, and for a short period thereafter he worked as a teacher in a district school.

In 1853, he became Deputy Postmaster of Watertown, New York, at a salary of $600 a year, and after six years had saved $1,000 and opened with a partner a jewelry store. Two years later, he bought his partner out and continued in this business until 1869.

In 1869, Henry Keep, a former President of the New York Central Railroad, was dying and asked Roswell Flower, whose wife was a sister of Keep&#x27;s wife Emma, to manage the $4,000,000 estate for his widow. Flower asked Keep for guidance on who he could trust and named a business associate, Daniel Drew. Keep replied, &quot;He is as honest a man as there is in the State of New York, but for fear that somebody else will cheat, he will always begin first.&quot; The business brought Flower to New York City where he became known as a shrewd financial administrator and opened the banking house of R. P. Flower &amp; Co.

He was elected as a Democrat to the 47th United States Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Levi P. Morton upon his appointment as Minister to France, and served from November 8, 1881, to March 3, 1883. He was also elected to the 51st and 52nd United States Congresses, and served from March 4, 1889, to September 16, 1891, when he resigned upon his nomination for governor.

He was Governor of New York from 1892 to 1894, elected in 1891, the last one to serve a three-year term. During his term, he signed into law the creation of the City of Niagara Falls.

In the years after his term as governor, Flower gained a reputation as a canny investor and attracted the attention of traders and investors from all over the United States. As a result of this strong following, Flower possessed an extraordinary capability to influence market sentiment. His aggressive move on Brooklyn Rapid Transit drove the share price of this company from $6 to over $130 a share in a relatively short period of time. The dramatic rise of this stock was widely credited with triggering the bull market that ran from 1898 to 1899.

Flower was Chairman of the Cornell University Board of Trustees from 1897 to his death in 1899.

Flower was president of the New York State Agricultural Society in 1899.

He died of a heart attack on May 12, 1899, in Eastport, New York, at the Long Island Country Clubhouse. His death disrupted the planned purchase by a consortium of investors, including Flower and William Henry Moore, of the steel-related holdings of Andrew Carnegie about a year and a half before J. P. Morgan purchased the same interests in the deal that formed U.S. Steel.

==Legacy==
A monument to Flower, designed by noted sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens in 1902, is located on lower Washington Street at Watertown. It is in the Public Square Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The Roswell P. Flower Memorial Library was built in 1903–04 as a memorial to Flower. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

<text>Major-General Anthony St Leger (1731/32 – 19 April 1786) was a successful soldier, a Member of Parliament for Grimsby, and the founder of the St. Leger Stakes horse race.

==Family==
Born in February 1731 at Grangemellon, Kildare, Ireland, he was the fourth son of Sir John St Leger, who was a judge of the Court of Exchequer, and his second wife Lavinia, daughter of Kingsmill Pennefather of Cashel. He was educated at Eton College. He attended Peterhouse, before embarking on a career in the army. His brother Barry St. Leger was also a distinguished army officer. They belonged to the junior branch of a long-established landowning family from Cork: the head of the senior branch was Viscount Doneraile.

==Marriage==
In 1761, St Leger married a Yorkshire woman, Margaret Wombwell. That same year he was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the 124th Regiment of Foot, but a year later the regiment disbanded, and St Leger took on the &quot;Park Hill&quot; estate in Firbeck, where he later bred and raced horses.

==Career==
From 1768 to 1774, St Leger sat as MP for Grimsby. Two years after leaving the Commons, and with the assistance of Charles Watson-Wentworth, he established a two-mile race for three-year-old horses, on the Cantley Common in Doncaster. This was to become the St. Leger Stakes.

In 1779, St Leger re-entered the army as colonel of the 86th Regiment of Foot. He subsequently achieved the rank of brigadier general, before serving a period as the Governor of Saint Lucia (1781-1783). His last posting was in Ireland, by which time he was a major general.

==Death and legacy==
St Leger died on 19 April 1786. He was buried in Saint Anne&#x27;s Church, Dublin.

In addition to giving his name to the St Leger Stakes, the &quot;St Leger Arms&quot; public house in Laughton en le Morthen (two miles up the road from the Park Hill estate) is also named after Anthony St Leger.

<doc id="682129" wikidata="Q918914" url="?curid=682129" title="British Columbia Highway 20">
<text>Highway 20, also known as the Chilcotin Highway, and officially dubbed the Alexander MacKenzie Highway, is one of the two main east–west routes in the Central Interior of British Columbia (the other being Highway 16 (the Yellowhead Highway). The Chilcotin Highway runs from Williams Lake westward through the Chilcotin region to North Bentinck Arm, an inlet from the Pacific Ocean where the town of Bella Coola is located. As of 2019, all but has been paved, mostly for expediting the removal of timber from the region, which, like most of British Columbia, is afflicted with pine beetle infestations. Logging traffic and ranch-related traffic on the route can be expected.

Highway 20 is famous for the portion of the westernmost stretch next to Young Creek Canyon, between Anahim Lake and Bella Coola, known as &quot;the Hill&quot; or &quot;The Precipice&quot;. From the point where the road crosses the Coast Range via Heckman Pass in Tweedsmuir South Provincial Park at an elevation of the road descends of steep, narrow road with sharp hairpin turns and two major switchbacks to the Bella Coola Valley. The descent includes a section with grades of up to 18% (about 1 in 6). The road is winding, in some places only wide enough for one vehicle, and in many places bordered on one side by cliffs, and on the other side by a drop of up to 320 metres (many hundreds of feet), unprotected by guardrails. Tourists who have driven to Bella Coola from Williams Lake have been known to refuse to drive back and have had to be taken out by boat or float plane.

Until 1953 Highway 20 ended at Anahim Lake, from Bella Coola. The province considered the terrain too difficult and refused to extend it, leaving Bella Coola inaccessible by road. The road, known at the time as the &quot;Freedom Road&quot;, was completed by local volunteers working from opposite ends with two bulldozers and supplies bought on credit. The two bulldozers met each other on the 26th of September 1953 and an official opening ceremony was held on the 18th of July 1955.

==Route description==
Highway 20 is scenic and very sparsely populated. It begins in Williams Lake at its juncture with Highway 97. It rises gradually for to the crossing of the Fraser River at Sheep Creek Bridge, from which it ascends via a series of steep switchbacks to the Chilcotin Plateau. Prior to improvements of the late 20th Century, including the Sheep Creek Bridge, it crossed the Fraser via a 1910s style suspension bridge, which was like those farther south at Gang Ranch-Dog Creek and Lillooet.

At it passes the site of the Williams Lake LORAN-C Tower, part of the maritime navigation system. This tower was dismantled in October 2011.

At it passes through Riske Creek (population 165) then at the hamlet of Hanceville (population 68).

Around it passes Anahim Reserve, a Chilcotin community before reaching Alexis Creek (population 317) at . From Alexis Creek it is to the next town, Tatla Lake (population 147).

 farther West is Nimpo Lake which serves as a float plane base for the region. Just west of Nimpo Lake the highway crosses the Dean River before reaching Anahim Lake (population 163) and the adjacent Indian reserve at . west of Anahim Lake, the highway enters Tweedsmuir South Provincial Park, and later, it crosses into the Central Coast Regional District at Heckman Pass. After the -long steep section alongside Young Creek Canyon, the highway meets the Atnarko River, and follows it west for to where the Atnarko merges with the Talchako River to form the Bella Coola River. Highway 20 then follows the Bella Coola River for to a bridge over Burnt Bridge Creek, at which point it exits the Park. After continuing to follow the Bella Coola River for another , the highway reaches Hagensborg, then another to the centre of Bella Coola (population 2500), and then another to the BC Ferry terminal.

<text>The following is a list of locomotives produced by the Electro-Motive Corporation (EMC), and its successors General Motors Electro-Motive Division (GM-EMD) and Electro-Motive Diesel (EMD).

== Streamlined power cars and early experimental locomotives ==

EMC participated in the construction of a number of motorized railcars, integrated streamliner trainsets, and experimental locomotives in the 1930s. Most of these were short production runs (one, two, or four units) that were used by a single railroad. These consisted of Winton prime movers and General Electric generating, control, and transmission components inside a carbody whose assembly was subcontracted to another manufacturer, since EMC did not commence regular road locomotive production until 1937.

==Switchers (SW/NW/SC/NC/MP)==
The &quot;S&quot; designation originally stood for six hundred horsepower and the &quot;N&quot; designation for nine hundred horsepower, although they were used for the more general designation of smaller and larger engine models after the more powerful 567 model engines replaced the Winton engines. The &quot;C&quot; designation stood for cast frame locomotives and the &quot;W&quot; designation for welded frame locomotives. EMC standardized on welded frames after 1939. The &quot;TR&quot; designation stood for transfer locomotives.

The SC and SW switchers were the first locomotives produced in EMC&#x27;s new factory after its completion in 1936. The pre-SC and Model 90 switchers were development design locomotives outshopped in 1935.

<doc id="682143" wikidata="Q889578" url="?curid=682143" title="Boeing KC-767">
<text>The Boeing KC-767 is a military aerial refueling tanker and transport aircraft developed from the Boeing 767-200ER. The tanker received the designation KC-767A, after being selected by the U.S. Air Force (USAF) initially to replace older KC-135Es. In December 2003, the contract was frozen and later canceled due to corruption allegations.

The tanker was developed for the Italian and Japanese air forces, who ordered four tankers each. Financing of the development of the aircraft has largely been borne by Boeing, in the hope of receiving major orders from the USAF. Boeing&#x27;s revised KC-767 proposal to the USAF was selected in February 2011 for the KC-X program under the designation KC-46.

==Development==

===Commercial Derivative Air Refueling Aircraft===
At the start of the 2000s a considerable and sudden increase in their maintenance costs was leading the U.S. Air Force to run a procurement program for the replacement of around 100 of its oldest KC-135E Stratotankers. Most USAF KC-135s are of the updated KC-135R variant.

In early 2002 the USAF began negotiations with Boeing on the lease of tankers based on the Boeing 767 after it considered the Airbus A330-based tanker, the KC-330, to be more costly and a higher technical risk. The USAF said that an assessment of the two types &quot;shows that the EADS offering presents a higher-risk technical approach and less preferred financial arrangement&quot;. It also said that the larger KC-330 &quot;does not bring with it a commensurate increase in available air-refuelling offload&quot;.

In addition, the KC-767 has manual flight controls with an unrestricted flight envelope. The Boeing tanker officially received the &quot;KC-767A&quot; designation from the U.S. DoD in 2002 and that appeared in the 2004 edition of the DoD Model Designation report.

====USAF lease, cancellation and re-award====
For its Commercial Derivative Air Refueling Aircraft program, the USAF decided to lease around 100 KC-767 tankers from Boeing after it was selected. Despite other nations engaging in leasing of military aircraft, there was some criticism. U.S. Senator John McCain questioned whether it is really cost-effective for the USAF to &quot;lease&quot; aircraft at all, particularly as the aircraft would probably not have many, if any, buyers when their U.S. military service ended. The Congressional Budget Office has also criticized the draft leasing agreement as fiscally irresponsible. In November 2003, a compromise was struck whereby the Air Force would purchase 80 KC-767 aircraft and lease 20 more. 

In December 2003, the Pentagon announced the project was to be frozen while an investigation of allegations of corruption by one of its former procurement staffers, Darleen Druyun (who had moved to Boeing in January) was undertaken. Reporter Joseph L. Galloway wrote that some documents found in congressional investigation indicated the A330-based tanker met more of the USAF specifications than the Boeing tanker and had a lower proposed cost. Druyun pleaded guilty and was sentenced to nine months in jail for &quot;negotiating a job with Boeing at the same time she was involved in contracts with the company&quot;. Additional fallout included the termination of Boeing CFO Michael M. Sears, who was sentenced to four months in prison in 2005, and the resignation of Boeing CEO Philip M. Condit. The Air Force&#x27;s KC-767A contract was officially canceled by the DoD in January 2006.

===International acquisitions===
====Italy====
Boeing continued development of the aircraft. Italy selected the KC-767A and signed a contract in 2002 becoming the launch customer, with delivery set for 2005. The Italian Air Force (&quot;Aeronautica Militare&quot;) ordered four aircraft. This version is based on the 767-200ER and is named the &quot;KC-767 Tanker Transport&quot;, and is fitted with boom and hose-drogue refueling systems on the centerline with hose-drogue wingpod systems.

Italy&#x27;s aircraft became the first KC-767 to be assembled. The aircraft were initially built as 767-200ER commercial airplanes, then flown to a separate facility for conversion into tankers. Italy&#x27;s first aircraft made its maiden flight on 21 May 2005. Italy&#x27;s second aircraft arrived for modification at the facility of Boeing&#x27;s partner, Aeronavali, in Naples, Italy, on 6 May 2005.

Delivery of the tankers to the Italian Air Force was delayed due to an issue with flutter of the wing pods and other technical issues. Boeing provided a 767 for training during this time. After resolving the issues, Boeing delivered the first KC-767 in January, and the second in March 2011. These aircraft officially entered service on 17 May 2011 with the 14º Stormo. After entering service, the two KC-767s have supported NATO operations in Afghanistan and Libya. The final two tankers were delivered in late 2011.

====Japan====
In 2001, Japan selected the KC-767 over the Airbus A310 MRTT and signed a contract in 2003. The Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) ordered four aircraft and has designated the tanker &quot;KC-767J&quot;. In June 2005, Japan&#x27;s first aircraft arrived at Boeing&#x27;s Wichita, Kansas modification center to be fitted out with the tanker equipment.

Delivery of the first KC-767J for the JASDF was delayed approximately two years due to development issues and the addition of the aircraft receiving FAA certification. The Japanese version of the tanker is equipped only with the boom refueling system. Boeing and its Japanese representative Itochu agreed with Japan Ministry of Defense (MoD) to pay a penalty fee for the delivery delay, according to the MoD Statement. The first operational KC-767J was delivered to the JASDF on 19 February 2008, with the second KC-767J following on 5 March. The third KC-767 was delivered to the JASDF in March 2009. The three KC-767J aircraft reached initial operational capability (IOC) status with the JASDF in May 2009. The fourth tanker was delivered in January 2010. The aircraft are operated out of Komaki Air Base by 404th Tactical Airlift Tanker Squadron.

===Civilian 767 conversions===
As a low-cost alternative for nations unable to purchase new-build AAR tankers, Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) developed a variant of the KC-767, designated as the KC-767 Multi Mission Tanker Transport (MMTT). Designed as a cost-effective option against the KC-46 and the A330 MRTT, the KC-767 MMTT involves the conversion of pre-owned Boeing 767s into aerial tankers by the Bedek Aviation Group, a subsidiary of IAI. It is configured to suit the necessities of the customer, with multiple capabilities - including cargo transport, VIP transport, aerial refueling and ISR.

As part of its capabilities, the KC-767 MMTT incorporates a special cargo door, built-in cargo pallet capabilities, interchangeable passenger seats and operator consoles, ARP3 wing refueling pods and a fly-by-wire boom refueling system. As part of the conversion process, a significant proportion of the structure, wiring and systems of the aircraft are replaced, upgraded or refurbished, tailored to the customer&#x27;s specific requirements.

According to Bedek, the KC-767 MMTT has a maximum takeoff weight of and a maximum fuel load of , with the capacity to support 13 Lockheed Martin F-16 fighters on missions with a range of .

The first KC-767 MMTT, converted from a Boeing 767-200ER platform formerly operated by Air China, was tested in 2010; the converted tanker successfully demonstrated the aerial refueling of an IAI Kfir C10 fighter during a 3.5 hour test flight.

====Colombia====
In 2008, IAI was contracted to convert a secondhand Boeing 767-200ER, into an AAR tanker which would also serve as VIP transport, for the Colombian Air Force. The converted aircraft, nicknamed &quot;Jupiter&quot; (FAC-1202), was successfully tested in September 2010, and was delivered in November 2010. Colombia&#x27;s KC-767 MMTT supported US Navy EA-18G Growlers during Exercise Red Flag 19-2 in March 2019.

====India====
In April 2022, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and IAI signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to convert six pre-owned civilian aircraft into AAR tankers/freighter aircraft, for the Indian Air Force (IAF). Although the specifications of the selected aircraft are yet to be divulged, Indian representatives have stated that the aircraft likely to be procured for the IAF is the KC-767 MMTT.

===Former interests===
====Australia====
Australia selected the Airbus A330 MRTT in April 2004 after competition with the KC-767 due to the A330&#x27;s larger fuel and cargo capability. 

====United Kingdom====
Boeing, teamed with BAE Systems and British Airways, offered the KC-767 to the UK&#x27;s RAF for its Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft. The companies formed the Tanker Transport Services Consortium (TTSC). British Airways would provide the 767 aircraft, Boeing would provide the conversion technology based on its KC-767 tanker design and BAE Systems would perform the majority of aircraft modifications. Marshall Aerospace, Serco, Spectrum, and Capital were also part of TTSC. The Ministry of Defence announced in January 2004 that it had selected the Airbus A330 MRTT to fulfill this requirement.

====Republic of Korea====
The KC-767 was to compete with the A330 MRTT for the Republic of Korea Air Force&#x27;s procurement of four tanker aircraft. In June 2015, South Korea selected the A330 MRTT over the KC-46 for the procurement.

====Brazil====
In 2013, the Brazilian Air Force Command (FAB) selected IAI to provide two KC-767-300ER MMTT tankers, under its KC-X2 procurement initiative. However, a contract for the supply of the two aircraft was never finalised, and the project was ultimately abandoned.

===USAF KC-X program===
On 24 February 2011, Boeing&#x27;s KC-767 proposal was selected by the USAF as the winning offer to replace part of the KC-135 fleet. The aircraft received the designation KC-46A. Boeing was awarded an initial development contract to build and deliver 18 operational tankers by 2017.

==Operational history==

===Flight testing===
On 23 January 2007, the KC-767 flight test aircraft set a program milestone by making its first hookup with a receiver aircraft, a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress. The &quot;dry contact&quot; transferred no fuel, but was intended to test the tanker&#x27;s fifth-generation fly-by-wire telescoping boom. Unlike the KC-135 boom operator, who is prone, the KC-767 operator uses a remote station with a video display. The testing was being done at Edwards Air Force Base, and the test aircraft was destined for Italy once testing was complete.

The KC-767 extended its air refueling boom and transferred fuel to another aircraft for the first time on 5 March 2007. The tanker completed another test milestone on 12 April 2007 when its aircrew successfully extended and retracted both wing refueling hoses. In November 2007, Boeing decided to shift modification work on the KC-767A tankers for Italy and Japan from subcontractor Aeronavali&#x27;s facility in Italy to Boeing&#x27;s Wichita facility in an effort to meet delivery schedules.

<text>The Emme () is a river in Switzerland. It rises in the Alps between the peaks of Hohgant and Augstmatthorn in the canton of Bern. The Emme is long and flows through the Emmental and between Zuchwil and Luterbach into the Aare. The drainage area is . The average discharge at the mouth is approximately . The maximum discharge can be up to .

The Emme is known for its sudden variations in water discharge. The narration &quot;Die Wassernot im Emmental&quot; (&quot;The Water Crisis in the Emmen Valley&quot;) by Jeremias Gotthelf impressively describes a very large and destructive, and therefore well-known, flood which occurred August 13, 1837. This and other floods led to the building of numerous canals and dams in the 19th century.

The tributaries of the Emme are the Ilfis and the Limpach.

<doc id="682172" wikidata="Q692489" url="?curid=682172" title="Red Special">
<text>The Red Special is the electric guitar designed and built by Queen&#x27;s guitarist Brian May and his father, Harold, when Brian was a teenager in the early 1960s. The Red Special is sometimes referred to as the Fireplace or the Old Lady by May and by others. The name &quot;Red Special&quot; came from the reddish-brown colour the guitar attained after being stained and painted with numerous layers of &quot;Rustins Plastic Coating&quot;. The name &quot;Fireplace&quot; is a reference to the fact that the wood used to make the neck came from a fireplace mantel.

A guitar that would define May&#x27;s signature style, it was intentionally designed to feed back after he saw Jeff Beck playing live and making different sounds just by moving the guitar in front of the amplifier. He wanted an instrument that would be alive and interact with him and the air around him. May has used the Red Special almost exclusively, including on Queen albums and in live performances, throughout the band&#x27;s entire career.

In celebration of the instrument&#x27;s 50th anniversary, a book about its construction and history, &quot;Brian May’s Red Special: The Story of the Home-Made Guitar that Rocked Queen and the World&quot;, was written by Brian May with Simon Bradley.

==Construction==
Unlike the main instruments of most musicians, the Red Special was built by its player, May, along with his father. The inspiration struck when May realized he could not afford a Fender, Gibson or Höfner guitar. They began to work on the guitar in August 1963, with the project being finished in October 1964. The neck was constructed from wood from a &quot;hundred-year-old-ish&quot; fireplace mantel that a friend of the family was about to throw away. The neck was hand-shaped into the desired form, a job that was made more difficult by the age and quality of the wood. May revealed there are worm holes in the neck of the guitar that he filled in with matchsticks.

The neck was finished with a 24-fret oak fingerboard. Each of the position inlays was hand shaped from a mother-of-pearl button. May decided to position them in a personal way: two dots at the 7th and 19th fret and three at the 12th and 24th.

The body was made from blockboard (strips of softwood sandwiched between two plywood skins) with oak inserts in the top and bottom layers sourced from an old table. It was covered with mahogany marquetry veneer on the top, bottom and side to give it the appearance of a solid-body guitar. It was originally intended that the guitar would have f-holes but this was never done.

White plastic shelf edging was then applied to the top and bottom edges to protect them from damage. The guitar features three single-coil pick-ups and a custom-made aluminium bridge. May purchased a set of Burns Tri-Sonic pick-ups and covered the coils of two with Araldite epoxy to reduce microphonics. The middle pickup remained uncoated and this is understood to have been modified in the early 1980s when DiMarzio examined the Red Special when designing pickups for the first Guild replica. The magnet was turned over to change its polarity and the wires on the solder posts swapped (to mimic a reverse wound coil) which made his favoured pickup combination of bridge and middle in phase humbucking. He originally wound his own pick-ups, as he had for his first guitar, but he did not like the resulting sound because of the polarity of these pick-ups: alternating North-South instead of all North.
The tremolo system is made from an old hardened-steel knife-edge shaped into a V and two motorbike valve springs to counter the string tension. The tension of the springs can be adjusted by screwing the bolts, which run through the middle of the springs, in or out via two small access holes next to the rear strap button. To reduce friction, the bridge was completed with rollers to allow the strings to return perfectly in tune after using the tremolo arm (the arm itself was from a bicycle saddlebag holder with a plastic knitting needle tip). For the same reason, at the other end of the neck the strings pass over a zero fret and through a bakelite string guide.

Originally the guitar had a built-in distortion circuit, adapted from a mid-1960s Vox distortion effects unit. The switch for this was in front of the phase switches. May soon discovered that he preferred the sound of a Vox AC30 distorting at full power, so the circuit was removed. The switch hole is now covered by a mother-of-pearl star inlay, but was originally covered by a red dot in the 1970s, and some insulation tape in the 1980s.

==Appearances==

May still uses the original but he has used replicas in some performances. Notably, the original guitar was not used in the videos &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;, and &quot;Spread Your Wings&quot;, instead using his John-Birch-made Red Special copy (see Replicas section below) which differs from the original in its all-maple construction and natural maple color, since he did not want to expose the Red Special to snow. The Birch was also used live as a back-up for the Red Special until it was destroyed by May in a fit of rage due to the tuning stability issues. Similarly, he opted not to use the Red Special for the &quot;Play the Game&quot; video, instead using a budget Satellite-badged replica of a Fender Stratocaster, since at one point in the video, Queen singer Freddie Mercury would snatch the guitar from May and &quot;throw&quot; it back to him. The Red Special was omitted from the video for &quot;Princes of the Universe&quot;, in which May used a white Washburn RR11V (This guitar is often mistaken for a Jackson Rhoads). He recorded the original of &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot; on Queen drummer Roger Taylor&#x27;s Fender Esquire, but performed the accompanying video and live performances of the song until 1992 with a Fender Telecaster.

==Replicas==
=== Official replicas ===

The first official copy of the Red Special was made by British luthier John Birch and was used as a back-up for live performances until it was accidentally destroyed by May during a concert in August 1982. The Birch was used in place of the Red Special in the music videos for &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; (however, it was not used to record the song), and &quot;Spread Your Wings&quot;. The guitar differs from the original in its all-maple construction and natural finish except for the back which is gold finished. After its destruction May sent the guitar to American luthier John Page, who kept the remains for over 20 years before sending them back to May. May then had the guitar glued back together by Andrew Guyton and still owns it, however it hardly functions anymore.

Other official replicas of the Red Special have been manufactured in varying numbers and in multiple models (i.e. a higher-end full-featured model, and a lower-cost one lacking some of the intricacies of the former) several times during the 1980s and 1990s, most often by the Guild Guitar Company from 1983–85 and again from 1993–95, and by Burns Guitars from 2001 (mass-produced models made in Korea). The Burns model, produced with guidance from May, was awarded &quot;Best Electric Guitar of the Year 2001&quot; by &quot;Guitarist&quot; Magazine. Currently, only Brian May Guitars (taking over manufacture from Burns) manufacture authorised replicas, the Special at a budget price point and the Super Mk2 at a higher price point aimed at enthusiasts.

KZ Guitar Works manufactured the original Red Special Super model which was hand-made in Japan by master luthier Kazutaka Ijuin. This model has been discontinued and production of the revised Super model taken up in the Czech Republic for Brian May Guitars.

The Brian May Guitars version differs from the Burns original in several ways; for example, the tremolo was a two-point synchronised tremolo with rear access plate. These models also feature a half-moon scratch plate behind the bridge to emulate the original. The switches were also changed from black to white to match May&#x27;s guitar. They still use the Burns Tri-Sonic pick-ups. 24 guitars were made in a rare baby blue color with a pearloid pickguard and gold hardware. The guitars come in Antique Cherry (a similar color to that of the Red Special), White and 3-Tone Sunburst with chrome hardware. They also have Honey Sunburst, Black and Gold with gold hardware and other various finishes.

Greg Fryer, of Fryer Guitars an Australian luthier, produced three replicas of the Red Special in 1996/97, and with permission from May, made exhaustive measurements of the original guitar. Fryer named his three replicas John, Paul and George Burns (after two members of The Beatles and the famous American comedian). May has two of these guitars, John and George Burns; Fryer kept Paul for some years and used it for testing modified Vox AC30 amplifiers and his range of treble boosters until he sold it to a Japanese collector for an undisclosed sum. While the woods used in John and Paul are more faithful to the original, George Burns was built with New Guinea rosewood for a &quot;more aggressive edge&quot; tonally. John is May&#x27;s main back-up Red Special, and is tuned to standard. His green Guyton has replaced George Burns for Drop D tuning duties to play &quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot; live.

In 2004, Andrew Guyton of Guyton Guitars, a luthier in the UK, manufactured 50 authorised, limited edition replicas of the Red Special: 40 in red to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the guitar, and ten in green, as he had previously seen a green Guild copy that he liked.

=== Unofficial replicas ===

In the 1970s, Japanese guitar manufacturer Greco was the first company to market a line of mass produced Red Special copies, albeit unofficial and unlicensed. They did, however, send one to May himself, which he used in various mimed performances the most well known being the &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; performance for &quot;Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy&quot;.

CQuadro Guitar Works (now Carpinteri Guitars) in Italy makes Red Special replicas (the &quot;Bohemian&quot; and the &quot;Extreme&quot;).

Dansan Guitars makes Red Special replicas hand built in France.

 Dillion Guitars (prior to 2014 were built in Korea) making &quot;Tribute Guitars&quot; in two models. Dillion Guitars are manufactured in Vietnam by Inyen Vina CO. LTD of Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam. 

RS Custom Guitars run by Everett Wood makes a variety of Red Special style replicas hand-built in Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.

RS Guitars which were hand-built in Arizona, U.S. by Steve Turpin discontinued production of their models in January 2011.

In Germany Scheithauer Guitars makes a Red Special style replica called &quot;Mayday&quot; in Mühlhausen.

Harley Benton Guitars make replicas of the Red Special, however, their model has a single five-way switch in place of the three individual pickup switches, as well as having a 25 inch scale rather than 24 inches.

==Variations==
In 2006, Brian May Guitars introduced a &quot;Mini May&quot; guitar, based on a 3/4 sized Red Special body shape with a 24 fret, 19” scale (but with no zero fret) featuring a single pick-up, no switches and a maple neck. In 2017, the &quot;Mini May&quot; was upsized with a 22 3/4&quot; scale neck.

An acoustic guitar, featuring a 24-fret neck and the body outline of the Red Special went into production in 2007. This model is named the &quot;Rhapsody&quot;, after the Queen song &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;.

A bass guitar called the &quot;Bri-Bass&quot; was announced on May&#x27;s website and is available. It looks like his normal guitar but with four bass strings. It features a bound mahogany body and 31.5&quot; scale neck, topped with a 20-fret ebony fingerboard. Pickups are a Gibson EB-0 type chrome-covered humbucking neck pick-up and a rear-position single coil pick-up hooked up to a passive volume/volume/tone circuit.

The Guild models of the early 1990s featured three major configurations. Of the three, the &quot;Signature&quot; model was closest to May&#x27;s guitar, although it was made of mahogany (body and neck) and ebony (fingerboard) and sported Trisonic-styled &quot;Brian May&quot; pick-ups made by Seymour Duncan and hardware (including the unique bridge) from Schaller. The &quot;Special&quot; model featured a stop-tailpiece rather than a vibrato, the middle pick-up was moved back next to the bridge pick-up for a humbucking look, and the back of the guitar had no binding. The &quot;Standard&quot; model featured a more common Strat-style 5-way pick-up selector switch, a longer scale neck, and a deeper headstock angle. Andrew Guyton made May a double-neck version, which has never been a production model.

==Restoration==

After viewing the replicas and taking note of the wear and tear the Red Special had suffered during nearly 30 years of constant touring, May had Fryer restore the original Red Special in 1998 using as much original and time-period specific material as possible. Damaged veneer on the back of the guitar was removed and new pieces scarfed in. The binding was removed and various nicks and dents in the top were repaired. Fryer re-finished the neck and body in the original Rustin&#x27;s Plastic Coating used in the creation over the existing finish, and fretboard wear was repaired and dot-markers replaced. The original electrics were also re-wired and overhauled, and cosmetic work was done, such as filling in holes and worn areas on access panels, pick-up covers (worn by May&#x27;s use of a sixpence as opposed to a standard plectrum) and the front scratchplate.

The restored Red Special is prominently featured during a series of video interviews with &quot;Guitarist&quot; in 1999, in which May also demonstrated its feedback capabilities.

At the end of the Queen + Paul Rodgers tour in 2005, May had several revisions made to the original Red Special, including having the zero fret replaced for the first time (this had been judged unnecessary at the time of the 1998 restoration) and making a larger opening for a new, modern 1/4&quot; jack socket. Despite all of this work, the original frets (other than the zero fret) have never been replaced.

Andrew Guyton of Guyton Guitars, carried out a limited restoration in April 2016. This work involved making good all the cracks in the Rustins Plastic Coating lacquer finish, repairing damage to the end and edge, and touching in of the fretboard and replacing one of the mother-of-pearl marker dots. Various parts, including the tremolo and bridge assembly were removed, serviced, cleaned and lubricated then refitted. The zero fret was also replaced again.

==Specifications==
Body
*Oak from an old table and blockboard (with a mahogany veneer), semi-solid body
*Depth: 1 9/16&quot; (40 mm)
Neck
*Bolt on, one large bolt which sits beneath the fingerboard and goes through a hole in the body then a nut is then attached; it is also screwed down by two wood screws at the tenon end which ends just before the bridge pick-up. The Greg Fryer, Burns/Brian May Guitars, Guild, John Birch and Greco replicas feature a set (glued) neck.
*Mahogany from a Victorian fireplace surround mantel that was going to be thrown out.

<doc id="682181" wikidata="Q837174" url="?curid=682181" title="Erythropoiesis">
<text>Erythropoiesis (from Greek &#x27;erythro&#x27; meaning &quot;red&quot; and &#x27;poiesis&#x27; &quot;to make&quot;) is the process which produces red blood cells (erythrocytes), which is the development from erythropoietic stem cell to mature red blood cell.

It is stimulated by decreased O2 in circulation, which is detected by the kidneys, which then secrete the hormone erythropoietin. This hormone stimulates proliferation and differentiation of red cell precursors, which activates increased erythropoiesis in the hemopoietic tissues, ultimately producing red blood cells (erythrocytes). In postnatal birds and mammals (including humans), this usually occurs within the red bone marrow. In the early fetus, erythropoiesis takes place in the mesodermal cells of the yolk sac. By the third or fourth month, erythropoiesis moves to the liver. After seven months, erythropoiesis occurs in the bone marrow. Increased levels of physical activity can cause an increase in erythropoiesis. However, in humans with certain diseases and in some animals, erythropoiesis also occurs outside the bone marrow, within the spleen or liver. This is termed &quot;extramedullary erythropoiesis&quot;.

The bone marrow of essentially all the bones produces red blood cells until a person is around five years old. The tibia and femur cease to be important sites of hematopoiesis by about age 25; the vertebrae, sternum, pelvis and ribs, and cranial bones continue to produce red blood cells throughout life. Up to the age of 20 years, RBCs are produced from red bone marrow of all the bones (long bones and all the flat bones). After the age of 20 years, RBCs are produced from membranous bones such as vertebrae, the sternum, ribs, scapulas, and the iliac bones. After 20 years of age, the shaft of the long bones becomes yellow bone marrow because of fat deposition and loses the erythropoietic function.

Comparison of erythrocyte production by marrow stem cell lines from old and young adult donors shows no significant differences. This finding implies that little or none of the proliferative capacity of the erythropoietic stem cells is exhausted by a lifetime of normal functioning.

== Erythrocyte differentiation ==
In the process of red blood corpuscle maturation, a cell undergoes a series of &quot;differentiations&quot;. The following stages of development all occur within the bone marrow:
# A hemocytoblast, a multipotent hematopoietic stem cell, becomes
# a common myeloid progenitor or a multipotent stem cell, then
# a unipotent stem cell, then
# a pronormoblast (also commonly called an proerythroblast or a rubriblast), then
# a basophilic or early normoblast (also commonly called an erythroblast), then
# a polychromatophilic or intermediate normoblast, then
# an orthochromatic or late normoblast. At this stage the nucleus is expelled before the cell becomes
# a reticulocyte. (These cells still contain RNA and are also called &quot;immature red blood cells&quot;)

The cell is released from the bone marrow after Stage 7, and so in newly circulating red blood cells there are about 1% reticulocytes. After one to two days, these ultimately become &quot;erythrocytes&quot; or mature red blood cells.

These stages correspond to specific appearances of the cell when stained with Wright&#x27;s stain and examined by light microscopy, and correspond to other biochemical changes.

In the process of maturation, a basophilic pronormoblast is converted from a cell with a large nucleus and a volume of 900 fL to an enucleated disc with a volume of 95 fL. By the reticulocyte stage, the cell has extruded its nucleus, but is still capable of producing hemoglobin.

Essential for the maturation of red blood cells are Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) and Vitamin B9 (folate). Lack of either causes maturation failure in the process of erythropoiesis, which manifests clinically as reticulocytopenia, an abnormally low amount of reticulocytes.

==Characteristics seen in erythrocytes during erythropoiesis==
As they mature, a number of erythrocyte characteristics change:
* The overall size of the erythroid precursor cell decreases, increasing the cytoplasmic to nucleus (C:N) ratio. The nuclear diameter decreases and chromatin condenses with the staining reaction progressing from purplish red to dark blue at the final nuclear stage of the orthochromatic erythroblast, prior to nuclear ejection.
* The colour of the cytoplasm changes from blue at proerythroblast and basophilic stages to a pinkish red as a result of the increasing expression of haemoglobin as the cell develops.
* The nucleus is initially large in size and contains open chromatin. As red blood cells mature, the size of the nucleus decreases, until it finally disappears with the condensation of the chromatin material.

==Mechanism of erythropoiesis==
The production of all blood cells begins with the haemocytoblast, a multipotent haematopoietic stem cell. Haemocytoblasts have the greatest powers of self-renewal of any adult cell. They are found in the bone marrow and can be mobilised into the circulating blood when needed.
Some haemocytoblasts differentiate into common myeloid progenitor cells, which go on to produce erythrocytes, as well as mast cells, megakaryocytes and myeloblasts.
The process by which common myeloid progenitor cells become fully mature red blood cells involves several stages. First, they become normoblasts (aka erythroblasts), which are normally present in the bone marrow only.
Then, they lose their nucleus as they mature into reticulocytes, which can be thought of as immature red blood cells. Some of these are released into the peripheral circulation.
Finally, reticulocytes lose their remaining organelles as they mature into erythrocytes-which are fully mature red blood cells. The average lifespan of a red blood cell is approximately 120 days.
During this maturation process, there is nuclear extrusion – i.e. mature erythrocytes have no nucleus. Nucleated red blood cells present in a sample of bone marrow can indicate the release of incompletely developed cells. This can occur in pathology such as thalassaemia, severe anaemia or haematological malignancy.

==Regulation of erythropoiesis==
A feedback loop involving erythropoietin helps regulate the process of erythropoiesis so that, in non-disease states, the production of red blood cells is equal to the destruction of red blood cells and the red blood cell number is sufficient to sustain adequate tissue oxygen levels but not so high as to cause sludging, thrombosis, or stroke. Erythropoietin is produced in the kidney and liver in response to low oxygen levels. In addition, erythropoietin is bound by circulating red blood cells; low circulating numbers lead to a relatively high level of unbound erythropoietin, which stimulates production in the bone marrow.

Recent studies have also shown that the peptide hormone hepcidin may play a role in the regulation of hemoglobin production, and thus affect erythropoiesis. The liver produces hepcidin. Hepcidin controls iron absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and iron release from reticuloendothelial tissue. Iron must be released from macrophages in the bone marrow to be incorporated into the heme group of hemoglobin in erythrocytes. There are colony forming units that the cells follow during their formation. These cells are referred to as the committed cells including the granulocyte monocyte colony forming units.

The secretion of hepcidin is inhibited by another hormone, erythroferrone, produced by erythroblasts in response to erythropoietin, and identified in 2014. It appears that this links erythropoietin-driven eyrthropoiesis with the iron mobilization needed for hemoglobin synthesis.

Loss of function of the erythropoietin receptor or JAK2 in mice cells causes failure in erythropoiesis, so production of red blood cells in embryos and growth is disrupted. If there is no systemic feedback inhibition, for example, the diminishment or absence of suppressors of cytokine signaling proteins, giantism may result as shown in mice models.

== Stress erythropoiesis ==
In addition to the steady state erythropoiesis, acute anemia probably stimulates another response which results in rapid development of new red blood cells. This has been studied in rats and happens in the liver through the activation of the BMP4-dependent stress erythropoiesis pathway.

<text>Microphonics, microphony, or microphonism describes the phenomenon wherein certain components in electronic devices transform mechanical vibrations into an undesired electrical signal (noise). The term comes from analogy with a microphone, which is intentionally designed to convert vibrations to electrical signals.

==Description==
When electronic equipment was built using vacuum tubes, microphonics were often a serious design problem. The charged elements in the vacuum tubes can mechanically vibrate, changing the distance between the elements, producing charge flows in and out of the tube in a manner identical to a capacitor microphone. A system sufficiently susceptible to microphonics could experience audio feedback, and make noises if jarred or bumped. To minimize these effects, some vacuum tubes were made with thicker internal insulating plates and more supports, and tube-socket assemblies were sometimes shock-mounted by means of small rubber grommets placed in the screw holes to isolate them from vibration.
A special tool, called a valve hammer, or tube hammer was sometimes used to safely tap the device suspected of being microphonic, while it was operating, so checking if such a tap would produce objectional audio effects.

Microwave tube designers took numerous steps to reduce microphonics in klystrons. Where tuning was essential, a compromise usually was made between the resistance of the klystron to microphonism and the obtainable performance.

With the advent of solid-state electronics (transistors), this major source of microphonics was eliminated but smaller sources still remain.

The ceramic EIA Class 2 dielectrics used in high-κ capacitors (&quot;Z5U&quot; and &quot;X7R&quot;) are piezoelectric and directly transform mechanical vibration into a voltage in exactly the same way as a ceramic or piezoelectric microphone. Film capacitors using soft (mechanically compliant) dielectric materials can also be microphonic due to vibrational energy physically moving the plates of the capacitor. Likewise, variable capacitors using air as a dielectric are vulnerable to vibrations moving the plates. Capacitors using glass as the dielectric, while quite expensive, can be made to be essentially non microphonic.

Wiring, cables and even printed circuit boards (PCB) can also exhibit microphonics as charged conductors move around, and various materials can develop triboelectric charges (a type of static electricity) that couple to the electronic circuits.

Guitar amplifiers that incorporate the electronic chassis into the same cabinet as the speaker are susceptible to microphonics. Though a guitar amplifier&#x27;s microphonics distortion is sometimes appreciated as part of the &quot;special sound&quot; of a guitar amplifier, a faulty vacuum tube or other component can cause out-of-control positive feedback. Unwanted microphonics-related audible distortions can often be alleviated by using commercially available vacuum tube mechanical dampers.

The term may also be used to describe a video artifact common in older video cameras. Before the introduction of solid-state charge-coupled device (CCD) sensors to produce the image, vacuum tubes performed this task. Loud noises in the studio, such as rock bands or gunshot effects would cause the tubes to vibrate, producing a characteristic undesirable horizontal banding in the image.

The effect can also be observed when operating a record player in the same room as the loudspeakers. Depending on the construction of the player the sound may acoustically couple into the record player&#x27;s dust cover or other mechanical parts and cause a feedback loop into the pickup cartridge.

Many In-ear monitors exhibit microphonics when headphone cables transfer vibrations due to cable movement directly to the wearers ears.

<doc id="682190" wikidata="Q1754619" url="?curid=682190" title="Mount Tsukuba">
<text>is an mountain located at the northern-end of Tsukuba, Japan. It is one of the most famous mountains in Japan, particularly well known for its double peaks, and . Many people climb the so-called &quot;purple mountain&quot; every year for the panoramic view of the Kantō plain from the summit. On clear days the Tōkyō skyline, Lake Kasumigaura and even Mount Fuji are visible from the summit. Japanese mountains are mostly volcanic, but Mount Tsukuba is non-volcanic granite and gabbro in origin. Renowned beautiful granites are produced in the northern quarries even today.

== Etymology ==
The , a national geography completed in 721 AD, says Mount Tsukuba was named after a noble called . According to this account, the area around Mount Tsukuba was once called . Under the reign of (Emperor Sujin), Tsukuha no Mikoto from the was appointed as its governor. He had a strong desire to leave his name in history, so he renamed the area &quot;Tsukuha&quot;, which is now pronounced Tsukuba.

==History==
As legend has it, thousands of years ago, a deity descended from the heavens and asked two mountains for a place to spend the night. With its great summit and almost perfect cone, Mt. Fuji refused, believing with pride and arrogance that it does not need the deity&#x27;s blessings. Mt. Tsukuba, on the other hand, humbly welcomed the honored guest, even offering food and water. Today, Mt. Fuji is a cold, lonely, and barren mountain, while Mt. Tsukuba bursts with vegetation and is filled with colors as the seasons change.

Ancient chronicles say that the sacred progenitors of the Japanese race are enshrined here, the male divinity, Izanagi-no-Mikoto, at Mt. Nantai, and the female divinity, Izanami-no-Mikoto, at Mt. Nyotai. Legends say that the two deities wed and gave birth to other deities, and even to Japan herself.

In antiquity Mt. Nyotai served as location for &quot;kagai&quot; − harvest festivals associated with fertility − allowing people to participate in the mountains&#x27; marriage and promoting marriage between people. A poem by Takahashi no Mushimaro in the anthology Man&#x27;yōshū implies that these festivals also permitted adultery:
「鷲住 筑波乃山之 裳羽服津乃 其津乃上尓 率而 未通女壮士之 徃集 加賀布嬥歌尓 他妻尓 吾毛交牟 吾妻尓 他毛言問 此山乎 牛掃神之 従来 不禁行事叙 今日耳者 目串毛勿見 事毛咎莫」
“Washi no sumu / Tsukuha no yama no / Mohakitsu no / sono tsu no ue ni / adomohite / wotome wotoko no / yukitsudohi / kagafu kagahi ni / hitozuma ni / ware mo majiramu / waga tsuma ni / hito mo kototohe / kono yama wo / ushihaku kami no / mukashi yori / isamenu waza zo / kefu nomi ha / megushi mo na miso / koto mo togamu na”
“On the Mountain of Tsukuba / Where the eagles dwell / Near the Wells of Mohakitsu, / Seeking each other, in song of Kagai, / I will seek the wives of other men / And let other men woo my own. / The gods dwelling in these mountains / Have allowed this / Since olden times; / Do not make exception today / And do not reproach the lovers / And blame them not.”

The Imperial Japanese Navy used the &quot;Go&quot; signal&quot;NIITAKAYAMANOBORE 1208 ( [Kanji: ])&quot;, meaning &quot;Climb Mount Niitaka 1208&quot;to begin the surprise attack against the USN Pacific Fleet and its base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 7 December 1941 (8 December [1208] in Japanese calendar). On the other hand, the &quot;No Go&quot; signal used the mountain&#x27;s name, if needed, would be &quot;TSUKUBAYAMAHARE ( [Kanji: ]&quot;), meaning &quot;Mount Tsukuba is sunny&quot;.

== Industry ==

Located at an elevation of approximately 140 meters, Mount Tsukuba is a site for the cultivation of mandarin oranges. Various varieties, including Unshu mikan and Natsumikan, are grown in this region. Notably, the cultivation of a native species called &quot;Tsukuba mikan&quot; or &quot;Fukuremikan&quot; is prevalent. This indigenous mandarin is small-sized, with a diameter ranging from 2 to 3 cm, and is characterized by a thin peel and large seeds.

Considered the sole native species of mandarin oranges in Japan, the Tsukuba mikan belongs to the Rutaceae family and has historical roots, with mentions dating back to the &quot;Hitachi Fudoki.&quot;

The successful cultivation of mandarin oranges on Mount Tsukuba is attributed to the presence of a &quot;thermal belt&quot; on the mountain slope. This thermal belt experiences higher temperatures compared to the foothills, especially during the cold winter months. In the elevation range of 170-270 meters on Mount Tsukuba, the thermal belt maintains temperatures 3-4 °C higher than the foothills, creating favorable conditions for mandarin orange cultivation. This phenomenon has allowed for the appearance of tourist-oriented mandarin orchards since the 1980s.

A similar utilization of a thermal belt for agriculture is observed in Shizuoka Prefecture, where tea cultivation takes advantage of comparable conditions.

==Attractions==

Mt. Tsukuba is famous not only for the legends that have appeared in poetry anthologies since 710 A.D. Today, the mountain and its centuries-old Shinto shrine Tsukubasan Shrine are both a source of blessing for the Japanese people and a must-see attraction to both local and foreign tourists. As the peaks (male and female) make a couple, they are worshipped as kami in the Shinto religion and are believed to bestow marital harmony and conjugal bliss. 

At the foot of the southern face lies the main shrine called “Tsukuba-san-jinja” (筑波山神社). This ancient shrine is a popular destination for tourists, festival (&quot;matsuri&quot;) attendees and the occasional Japanese-style wedding. It is from here where the main hiking trails up the mountain begin. One can choose to go straight up the mountain via the Miyukigahara course (御幸ヶ原コース), which parallels the Swiss-made funicular, to the notch between the peaks. Or one can follow the Shirakumobashi course (白雲橋コース) up to the east ridge, where it joins up with the Otatsuishi course, and then continues on up to Mt. Nyotai. 

In addition to the funicular there is also an aerial tramway which follows the east ridge up the mountain, paralleling the Otatsuishi course (おたつ石コース). At the top of the mountain there are many gift shops and food stalls in the area between the two peaks. Here one can purchase ramen, omiyage, beer and the local cure-all, toad oil (がま油). 

At both Mt. Nantai-san and Mt. Nyotai-san are small shrines devoted to their respective gods. The mountain is a popular starting point for parasailing.

==Fauna and flora==
===Flora===
Mount Tsukuba has an abundance of nature which covers the entire mountain. At lower elevations of the mountain are trees such as live oak (赤樫), mountain cherry (山桜), Japanese cedar (杉), Japanese red pine (赤松) and Hinoki cypress (檜). Higher in elevation, one can find species such as beech (ぶな), Japanese mountain maple (山紅葉) and a variety of conifers. Below these giants of the forest, the mountain is also home to hydrangea (紫陽花), rhododendron (つつじ), hosta, bush clover (ヤマハギ), five-leaf akebia (アケビ), fern, gold-banded lily (ヤマユリ) and the dog-tooth violet (片栗), to name a few.

===Fauna===
Amongst these exist a myriad of insects, including hairy caterpillars (毛虫), centipedes, giant hornets (スズメバチ), stick insects, praying mantis (カマキリ), cicada (セミ), a number of amphibians and over 70 species of butterfly (蝶). Larger animals such as the Japanese hare, mamushi pit viper (蝮), sika deer (鹿), Japanese boar (猪), raccoon dog (狸), Japanese badger (穴熊) and the Japanese red fox (狐) can be occasionally spotted. In addition, over 700 bird species are known to Mt. Tsukuba, these include the Japanese robin (駒鳥), Japanese pheasant, Japanese white-eye (目白), Japanese grosbeak, cinnamon sparrow (すずめ), Japanese quail and the Japanese green woodpecker.

<doc id="682195" wikidata="Q300786" url="?curid=682195" title="Aafia Siddiqui">
<text>Aafia Siddiqui (also spelled Afiya; ; born 2 March 1972) is a Pakistani neuroscientist and educator who gained international attention following her conviction in the United States and is currently serving an 86-year sentence for attempted murder and other felonies at the Federal Medical Center, Carswell, in Fort Worth, Texas.

Siddiqui was born in Pakistan to a Sunni Muslim family. For a period from 1990, she studied in the United States and obtained from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology a B.S. in biology, and a Ph.D. in neuroscience from Brandeis University in 2001. She returned to Pakistan for a time following the 9/11 attacks and again in 2003 during the war in Afghanistan. Khalid Sheikh Mohammad named her a courier and financier for al-Qaeda, and she was placed on the Federal Bureau of Investigations&#x27;s Seeking Information – Terrorism list; she was the first woman to have been featured on the list. Around this time, she and her three children were allegedly kidnapped in Pakistan.

Five years later, she reappeared in Ghazni, Afghanistan, and was arrested by Afghan police and held for questioning by the FBI. While in custody, Siddiqui allegedly told the FBI she had gone into hiding but later disavowed her testimony and stated she had been abducted and imprisoned. Supporters believe she was held captive at Bagram Air Force Base as a ghost detainee, an allegation the US government denies. During the second day in custody, she allegedly shot at visiting U.S. FBI and Army personnel with an M4 carbine one of the interrogators had placed on the floor by his feet. She was shot in the torso when a warrant officer returned fire. She was hospitalized, treated and then extradited to the US, where in September 2008 she was indicted on charges of assault and attempted murder of a US soldier in the police station in Ghazni, charges she denied. She was convicted on 3 February 2010 and later sentenced to 86 years in prison.

Her case has been called a &quot;flashpoint of Pakistani-American tensions&quot;, and &quot;one of the most mysterious in a secret war dense with mysteries&quot;. In Pakistan, her arrest and conviction was seen by the public as an &quot;attack on Islam and Muslims&quot;, and occasioned large protests throughout the country; while in the US, she was considered by some to be especially dangerous as &quot;one of the few alleged Al Qaeda associates with the ability to move about the United States undetected, and the scientific expertise to carry out a sophisticated attack&quot;. She has been termed &quot;Lady al-Qaeda&quot; by a number of media organizations due to her alleged affiliation with Islamists. Islamic State have offered to trade her for prisoners on two occasions: once for James Foley and once for Kayla Mueller. Pakistani news media called the trial a &quot;farce&quot;, while other Pakistanis labeled this reaction &quot;knee-jerk Pakistani nationalism&quot;. Yusuf Raza Gilani, who was the Pakistani Prime Minister at that time, and opposition leader Nawaz Sharif promised to push for her release.

== Biography ==
=== Family and early life ===
Aafia Siddiqui was born in Karachi, Pakistan, to Muhammad Salay Siddiqui, a British-trained neurosurgeon, and Ismet ( Faroochi), an Islamic teacher, social worker and charity volunteer. She belongs to the Urdu-speaking Muhajir, Deobandi community of Karachi. She was raised in an observant Muslim household, although her parents combined devotional Islam with their resolve to understand and use technological advances in science.

Ismet Siddiqui was prominent in political and religious circles, teaching classes on Islam wherever she lived, founding a United Islamic Organization, and serving as a member of Pakistan&#x27;s parliament. Her support for strict Islam in the face of feminist opposition to his Hudood Ordinances drew the attention of General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq who appointed her to a Zakat Council. Siddiqui is the youngest of three siblings. Her brother, Muhammad, studied to become an architect in Houston, Texas, while her sister, Fowzia, is a Harvard-trained neurologist who worked at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore and taught at Johns Hopkins University before she returned to Pakistan.

Aafia attended school in Zambia until the age of eight and finished her primary and secondary schooling in Karachi.

=== Undergraduate education ===
Siddiqui moved to Houston, Texas, US on a student visa in 1990, joining her brother who was studying architecture. She attended the University of Houston where friends and family described her interests as limited to religion and schoolwork. She avoided movies, novels and television, except for the news. After three semesters, she transferred to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

In 1992, as a sophomore, Siddiqui won a $5,000 Carroll L. Wilson Award for her research proposal &quot;Islamization in Pakistan and its Effects on Women&quot;. She returned to Pakistan to interview architects of the Islamization and the Hudood Laws, including Taqi Usmani, the spiritual adviser to her family. As a junior, she received a $1,200 City Days fellowship through MIT&#x27;s program to help clean up Cambridge elementary school playgrounds. While she initially had a triple major in biology, anthropology, and archaeology at MIT, she graduated in 1995 with a BS in biology.

At MIT, Siddiqui lived in the all-female McCormick Hall. She remained active in charity work and proselytising. Her fellow MIT students described her as being religious, which was not unusual at the time, but not a fundamentalist, one of them saying that she was &quot;just nice and soft-spoken&quot;. She joined the Muslim Students&#x27; Association, and a fellow Pakistani recalls her recruiting for association meetings and distributing pamphlets. Siddiqui began doing volunteer work for the Al Kifah Refugee Center after returning from Pakistan. Al Kifah included members who assassinated Jewish ultranationalist Meir Kahane and helped Ramzi Yousef with the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. She was known for her effectiveness in shaming audiences into contributing to jihad and the only woman known to have regularly raised money for Al-Kifah. Through the student association she met several committed Islamists, including Suheil Laher, its imam, who had publicly advocated Islamization and jihad before 9/11. Journalist Deborah Scroggins suggested that through the association&#x27;s contacts Siddiqui may have been drawn into the world of terrorism:

Aafia&#x27;s commitment to al-Kifah showed no sign of dimming when the connection between its Jersey City branch and the World Trade Center bombing became apparent. When the Pakistani government helped the US arrest and extradite Ramzi Yousef for his role in the bombing (where Yousef hoped to kill 250,000 Americans by knocking one WTC tower over into the other) an outraged Siddiqui circulated the announcement with a scornful note deriding Pakistan for &quot;officially&quot; joining &quot;the typical gang of our contemporary Muslim governments&quot;, closing her email with a quote from the Quran warning Muslims not to take Jews and Christians as friends. She wrote three guides for teaching Islam, expressing the hope in one: &quot;that our humble effort continues... and more and more people come to the [religion] of Allah until America becomes a Muslim land.&quot; She also took a 12-hour pistol training course at the Braintree Rifle and Pistol Club, mailed US military manuals to Pakistan and moved from her apartment after the FBI agents visited the university looking for her.

=== Marriage, graduate school, and work ===
In 1995, she agreed to a marriage arranged by her mother to Karachi-born anesthesiologist Amjad Mohammed Khan just out of medical school and whom she had never seen. The marriage ceremony was conducted over the telephone. Khan then came to the US, and the couple lived first in Lexington, Massachusetts, and then in the Mission Hill neighbourhood of Roxbury, Boston, where he worked as an anesthesiologist at Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital. She gave birth to a son, Muhammad Ahmed, in 1996, and to a daughter, Mariam Bint-e Muhammad, in 1998.

Siddiqui studied cognitive neuroscience at Brandeis University. In early 1999, while she was a graduate student, she taught the General Biology Laboratory course. She received her PhD in 2001 after completing her dissertation on learning through imitation; &quot;Separating the Components of Imitation&quot;. She co-authored a journal article on selective learning that was published in 2003. One incident that caused controversy was her presentation of a paper on fetal alcohol syndrome where she concluded that science showed why God had forbidden alcohol in the Quran. When told by some teachers this was inappropriate, she complained bitterly of discrimination to the associate dean of graduate studies, threatening to &quot;open a can of worms&quot;.

After receiving her PhD, she told one of her advisers she planned to devote herself to her family rather than a career. She began translating biographies of Arab Afghan &quot;shahid&quot; (jihad fighters who had been killed) written by Abdullah Yusuf Azzam (&quot;the Godfather of Afghan Jihad&quot;). and became more strict in her religion, wearing a &quot;niqāb&quot;—a black veil that covered everything but her eyes—and avoiding any music—even background music at science exhibits.

In 1999, while living in Boston, Siddiqui founded the Institute of Islamic Research and Teaching as a nonprofit organization. She was the organization&#x27;s president, her husband treasurer, and her sister resident agent. She attended a mosque outside the city where she stored copies of the Quran and other Islamic literature for distribution. She also co-founded the Dawa Resource Center, which offered faith-based services to prison inmates.

=== Divorce, al-Qaeda allegations, and remarriage ===
Tensions began to arise in her marriage, which, according to Siddiqui&#x27;s husband Khan, was caused by her overwhelming devotion to activism and jihad. Siddiqui temporarily moved away from her husband after he threw a baby bottle at her that required a visit to the emergency room to stitch up her lip. In the summer of 2001, the couple moved to Malden, Massachusetts.

According to Khan, after the 9/11 attacks, Siddiqui was adamant that the family leave the US, saying that their lives were in danger if they remained. Once back in Pakistan, Siddiqui demanded that the family move to the border with Afghanistan and Khan work as a medic to help the Taliban &quot;mujahideen&quot; in their fight against America. Khan was reluctant to disobey his parents who opposed this move, and uncertain if he had reached the stature traditionally thought necessary to wage jihad. Siddiqui agreed to return to him in the US in January 2002 after he agreed to her conditions including that he join her in Islamic activities. She began home schooling her children.

By this point, the FBI was questioning Siddiqui&#x27;s former professors and other associates. In May 2002, the FBI began questioning Siddiqui and her husband regarding their purchase over the internet of $10,000 worth of night vision equipment, body armour, and military manuals including &quot;The Anarchist&#x27;s Arsenal&quot;, &quot;Fugitive&quot;, &quot;Advanced Fugitive&quot;, and &quot;How to Make C-4&quot;. Khan claimed that these were for hunting and camping expeditions. He later told authorities he purchased them to please Siddiqui. The couple made an appointment to talk to the FBI again in a few weeks, but, according to Khan, Siddiqui insisted the family leave for Pakistan, and on 26 June 2002, the couple and their children returned to Karachi.

In August 2002, Khan alleged that Siddiqui was abusive and manipulative throughout their seven years of marriage; he suspected she was involved in extremist activities. Khan went to Siddiqui&#x27;s parents&#x27; home, announced his intention to divorce her, and argued with her father. Shortly after, Siddiqui&#x27;s father died of a heart attack, an event blamed on Khan and the marriage difficulties he and Siddiqui were having. This further poisoned his relationship with Siddiqui&#x27;s family.

In September 2002, Siddiqui gave birth to Suleman, the last of their three children. Following an attempted and failed reconciliation and the signing of a divorce document shortly after, the couple never saw each other again. The couple&#x27;s divorce was finalised on 21 October 2002. According to her statements to the FBI, it was at this point that her connections with Al-Qaeda began in earnest.

In February 2003, Siddiqui married Ammar al-Baluchi, an accused al-Qaeda member and a nephew of al-Qaeda leader Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM), in Karachi. While her family denies she married al-Baluchi, Pakistani and US intelligence sources, a psychologist for the defense during her 2009 trial, and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed&#x27;s family all confirm that the marriage took place. The marriage lasted only a couple of months. According to one of KSM&#x27;s uncles, Mohammed Hussein, al-Baluchi became alienated with Siddiqui&#x27;s &quot;liberal way of life.&quot; Siddiqui told the FBI that al-Baluchi divorced her after he was arrested.

==== Alleged conspiring with KSM ====
Siddiqui left for the US on 25 December 2002, informing her ex-husband Amjad Mohammed Khan that she was looking for a job; she returned on 2 January 2003. He later stated he was suspicious of her explanation as universities were on winter break. The purpose of the trip was to assist Majid Khan in opening a post office box so that it could appear he was living in the US when he mailed his application for an INS travel document. Majid Khan was listed as a co-owner of the box. The FBI alleged that Majid Khan was an al-Qaeda operative. Siddiqui told the FBI that she agreed to open the post box and mail the application because he was a family friend. The P.O. box key was later found in the possession of Uzair Paracha, who was convicted of providing material support to al-Qaeda.

According to the US government, Majid Khan was an operative for an Al-Qaeda cell led by Khalid Sheikh Mohammad which planned to attack targets in the US, in the UK (at Heathrow Airport), and inside Pakistan. In the US, C-4 plastic explosives and other chemicals would be smuggled in under the cover of textile exports – 20 and 40 ft foot containers filled with women&#x27;s and children&#x27;s clothes. The explosives would be used to bomb petrol stations, underground fuel storage tanks in Baltimore and chemicals to poison or destroy pumps to water treatment facilities. A dummy import-export business run by Saifullah Paracha (who is now interned at Guantánamo Bay), would import the explosives.

According to the US government, Siddiqui&#x27;s role was to &quot;rent houses and provide administrative support for the operation&quot;. When she returned from Pakistan to the US in January 2003, it was, according to the charge, to help renew the American travel papers of Majid Khan, who would execute the bombing. In his testimony, Majid Khan stated that he provided Siddiqui with money, photos, and a completed application for an &quot;asylum travel form&quot; that &quot;looked and functioned like a passport&quot;. He also testified that back in the US Siddiqui &quot;opened a post office box in detainee&#x27;s name, using her driver&#x27;s licence information&quot;.

The plot unraveled after Majid Khan was arrested in Pakistan on 1 March 2003 and sent to Guantánamo. In America, another operative, Uzair Paracha, was arrested in possession of the post box key. Defense attorneys note that testimony gathered by investigators was &quot;likely to have been extracted under conditions of torture&quot;. Her lawyer suggested she had been the victim of identity theft while her sister Fowzia has maintained the post office box was intended for use in applying for jobs at American universities. In Siddiqui&#x27;s trial, charges were not brought against her for opening of the post box or mailing the application.

Amjad M Khan (her ex-husband) was questioned by the FBI and released.

==== Blood diamond allegations ruled out ====
According to a dossier prepared by UN investigators for the 9/11 Commission in 2004, Siddiqui, using the alias Fahrem or Feriel Shahin, was one of six alleged al-Qaeda members who bought $19 million worth of blood diamonds in Monrovia, Liberia, immediately prior to the 11 September 2001 attacks. The diamonds were purchased because they were untraceable assets to be used for funding al-Qaeda operations. The identification of Siddiqui was made three years after the incident by one of the go-betweens in the Liberian deal. Alan White, former chief investigator of the UN-backed war crimes tribunal in Liberia, said she was the woman. Siddiqui&#x27;s lawyer maintained credit card receipts and other records showed that she was in Boston at the time.

In early 2003, while Siddiqui was working at Aga Khan University in Karachi, she emailed a former professor at Brandeis and expressed interest in working in the US, citing lack of options in Karachi for women of her academic background.

According to &quot;a combination of US intelligence analysis and direct testimony by at least three senior al-Qaida figures&quot;, known as Guantánamo files, Siddiqui was an al-Qaeda operative. The file included evidence from Khalid Sheikh Muhammad (KSM), the al-Qaeda chief planner of the 11 September 2001 attacks, who was interrogated and tortured (waterboarded 183 times) after his arrest on 1 March 2003. His &quot;confessions&quot; – obtained while being tortured – triggered a series of related arrests shortly thereafter and included naming Siddiqui. On 25 March 2003, the FBI issued a global &quot;wanted for questioning&quot; alert for Siddiqui and her ex-husband, Khan. Siddiqui was accused of being a &quot;courier of blood diamonds and a financial fixer for al-Qaida&quot;.
FBI agent Dennis Lormel, who investigated terrorism financing, said the agency ruled out a specific claim that she had evaluated diamond operations in Liberia though she remained suspected of money laundering.

=== Disappearance ===

Aware that the FBI wanted her for questioning, she left her parents&#x27; house 30 March 2003 with her three children. According to her parents, she was going to go to Islamabad to visit her uncle but never arrived. Around 25 March, the FBI put out a &quot;worldwide alert&quot; for Aafia and her ex-husband.

Siddiqui&#x27;s and her children&#x27;s whereabouts and activities from March 2003 to July 2008 are a matter of dispute. Her supporters and the Pakistani government claim she was held as a prisoner by the US; the US government and others (including Siddiqui in her statements to the FBI immediately after her arrest) suggest she went into hiding with KSM&#x27;s al-Baluchi family.

Starting 29 March, a &quot;confusing series&quot; of reports and denials of her arrest and detention appeared in Pakistan and the US. On 1 April 2003, local newspapers reported and Pakistan interior ministry confirmed that a woman had been taken into custody on terrorism charges. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; described &quot;sketchy&quot; Pakistani news reports saying she had been detained for questioning by Pakistani authorities and the FBI. However, a couple of days later, both the Pakistan government and the FBI publicly stated they were uninvolved in her . Her sister Fowzia claimed Interior Minister Faisal Saleh Hayat said that her sister had been released and would be returning home &quot;shortly&quot;.

In 2003–04, the FBI and the Pakistani government said Siddiqui was still at large. On 26 May 2004, US Attorney General John Ashcroft held a press conference described her as among the seven &quot;most wanted&quot; al-Qaeda fugitives and a &quot;clear and present danger to the US&quot;. &quot;Newsweek&quot; reported that she might be &quot;the most immediately threatening suspect in the group&quot;.

One day before the announcement, however, &quot;The New York Times&quot; cited the US Department of Homeland Security saying there were no current risks; American Democrats accused the Bush administration of attempting to divert attention from plummeting poll numbers and to push the failings of the Invasion of Iraq off the front pages.

After her 2008 reappearance and arrest, Siddiqui told the FBI that she had at first gone into hiding with KSM&#x27;s al-Baluchi clan (her lawyer later repudiated that statement) and worked at the Karachi Institute of Technology in 2005, was in Afghanistan in 2007, and also spent time in Quetta, Pakistan, sheltered by various people. She told the FBI she met with Mufti Abu Lubaba Shah Mansoor, and according to the FBI had begun collecting materials on viruses for biological warfare. According to an intelligence official in the Afghan Ministry of the Interior, her son, Ahmed, who was with her when she was arrested, said he and Siddiqui had worked in an office in Pakistan collecting money for poor people. He told Afghan investigators that on 14 August 2008 they had traveled by road from Quetta to Afghanistan. An Afghan intelligence official said he believes that Siddiqui was working with Jaish-e-Mohammed (the &quot;Army of Muhammad&quot;), a Pakistani Islamic &quot;mujahideen&quot; military group that fights in Kashmir and Afghanistan.

According to her ex-husband Khan, after the global alert for her was issued, Siddiqui went into hiding and worked for al-Qaeda. During her disappearance, Khan said he saw her at Islamabad airport in April 2003 as she disembarked from a flight with their son; he said he helped Inter-Services Intelligence identify her. He said he again saw her two years later, in a Karachi traffic jam. Khan unsuccessfully sought custody of his son Ahmed and said most of the claims of Siddiqui&#x27;s family in the Pakistani media relating to her and their children were one-sided and largely false.

In a signed affidavit, Siddiqui&#x27;s maternal uncle, Shams ul-Hassan Faruqi, stated that on 22 January 2008 she visited him in Islamabad and told him she had been held by Pakistani agencies. Knowing he had worked in Afghanistan and made contact with the Taliban in 1999, she asked for his help to cross into Taliban-controlled Afghanistan where she thought she would be safe. He told her he was no longer in touch with them. He notified his sister, Siddiqui&#x27;s mother, who came the next day to see her daughter. He said that Siddiqui stayed with them for two days. Investigating the disappearance, US journalist Deborah Scroggins reported that Geo TV presenter Hamid Mir informed her that friends of Siddiqui believed she had gone underground avoiding the FBI. Scroggins was also warned by Pakistanis with jihadist connections, including Khalid Khawaja, that she might end up like Daniel Pearl (who was beheaded) if she attempted to find Siddiqui.

Ahmed and Siddiqui reappeared in 2008. Afghan authorities handed the boy over to his aunt in Pakistan in September 2008, who has prohibited the press from talking to him. In April 2010, DNA identified a girl as Siddiqui&#x27;s daughter, Mariyam.

==== Alleged kidnapping ====
When Siddiqui&#x27;s ex-mother and father-in-law filed a custody suit against the Siddiqui family in an attempt to see their grandchildren (the Siddiqui family refused to talk to them), Siddiqui&#x27;s mother claimed under oath the FBI and US Justice Department officials had informed her that &quot;the minors are with the mother and are in safe condition&quot;, the opposite of what such officials had told her American lawyer in May of that year. Siddiqui&#x27;s sister and mother denied that she had any connections to al-Qaeda and claimed that the US held her secretly in Afghanistan. They pointed to comments by former Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan, detainees who say Siddiqui had been at the prison while they were there. Her sister said that Siddiqui had been raped, and tortured for five years. According to journalist, Muslim convert, and former Taliban captive Yvonne Ridley, Siddiqui spent those years in solitary confinement at Bagram as &quot;Prisoner 650&quot;. Six human rights groups, including Amnesty International, listed her as a possible ghost prisoner held by the US. In early 2007, the Pakistan government started releasing more than a hundred people who had been listed as &quot;missing&quot;. At the time, the CIA reportedly detained up to 100 people at secret facilities. S.H. Faruqi, Siddiqui&#x27;s uncle, reported that Siddiqui visited him in January 2008, telling him she had been imprisoned and tortured at Bagram Airfield for several years and released to serve as a double agent infiltrating extremist groups. Siddiqui herself later claimed that she had been kidnapped by US intelligence and Pakistani intelligence.

According to one Pakistani report, her mother claimed to have been warned by an unidentified man &quot;not to make a fuss about her daughter&#x27;s disappearance, if she wants safe recovery of her daughter&quot;, suggesting that either government intelligence services or the &quot;nexus of Pakistani and Arab jihadis&quot; had hidden Siddiqui.

Siddiqui has not explained clearly what happened to her other two children. According to a psychiatric exam given while she was in custody, her story has alternated between claiming that the two youngest children were dead and that they were with her sister Fowzia. She told one FBI agent that pursuing the cause of jihad had to take priority. Khan said he believed that the missing children were in Karachi, either with or in contact with Siddiqui&#x27;s family, and not in US detention. He said that they had been seen in her sister&#x27;s house in Karachi and in Islamabad since 2003.

In April 2010, Mariam was found outside the family house wearing a collar with the address of the family home. She was said to be speaking English. A Pakistani ministry official said the girl was believed to have been held captive in Afghanistan from 2003 to 2010.

The US government said it had not held Siddiqui during that time frame and was unaware of her location from March 2003 until July 2008. The mass of secret U.S. cables released in 2010 by Wikileaks included memos by the US Embassy in Islamabad Pakistan asking other US government departments whether Asfia had been in secret custody. One stated: &quot;Bagram officials have assured us that they have not been holding Siddiqui for the last four years, as has been alleged.&quot;

The US ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, stated that Siddiqui had not been in US custody &quot;at any time&quot; prior to July 2008. The US Justice Department and the CIA denied the allegations, and Gregory Sullivan, a State Department spokesman, said: &quot;For several years, we have had no information regarding her whereabouts whatsoever. It is our belief that she... has all this time been concealed from the public view by her own choosing.&quot; Assistant US Attorney David Raskin said in 2008 that US agencies found &quot;zero evidence&quot; that she was abducted, kidnapped, or tortured in 2003. He added: &quot;A more plausible inference is that she went into hiding because people around her started to get arrested, and at least two of those people ended up at Guantanamo Bay.&quot; According to some U.S. officials, she went underground after the FBI alert for her was issued and was at large working on behalf of al-Qaeda. &quot;The Guardian&quot; cited an anonymous senior Pakistani official suggesting Siddiqui may have abandoned the militant cause.

Another theory was that the CIA and FBI did not have the ability to capture suspects in Pakistan, where many people were anti-American, and only the ISI had the ability to capture Siddiqui. While the ISI may have known how to get her or even have her in custody, they were not &quot;ready to hand her over&quot;, whatever reward the Americans offered.

=== Alleged danger ===
Siddiqui was on the CIA&#x27;s list of suspected al-Qaeda terrorists it was authorized to &quot;kill or capture&quot;. According to Rolf Mowatt-Larssen of the Counterterrorism Center at the CIA, what set Siddiqui apart from other terrorism suspects was &quot;her combination of high intelligence (including general scientific know-how), religious zeal, and years of experience in the United States... So far they have had very few people who have been able to come to the U.S. and thrive. Aafia is different. She knows about U.S. immigration procedures and visas. She knows how to enroll in American educational institutions. She can open bank accounts and transfer money. She knows how things work here. She could have been very useful to them simply for her understanding of the U.S.&quot;

While the CIA&#x27;s sources of information could not determine her exact role in al-Qaeda, &quot;[s]he was always in the picture. Connections between her and other people in FBI was looking at surfaced in just about every al-Qaeda investigation with a U.S. angle. She was always on our radar.&quot;

According to the FBI, in her testimony to them she had collected materials on viruses for biological warfare and one of her projects was finding a way to infect America&#x27;s poultry supplies with an antibody that would allow chickens to pass salmonella on to humans more easily. She later destroyed her work after suspecting Abu Lubab was hoping to double cross her and turn her into the United States authorities.

=== Arrest in Afghanistan ===

On the evening of 17 July 2008, a woman was approached by Ghazni Province police officers in the city of Ghazni outside the Ghazni governor&#x27;s compound. She was holding two small bags at her side while crouching on the ground. This aroused the officer&#x27;s suspicion, raising concerns that she might be concealing a bomb under her burqa. Previously, a shopkeeper had noticed a woman in a burqa drawing a map, which is suspicious in Afghanistan where women are generally illiterate. There had also been a report that a Pakistani woman in a burqa with a boy were traveling in Afghanistan urging women to volunteer for suicide bombing. She was accompanied by a young boy that she said was her adopted son. She said her name was Saliha, that she was from Multan in Pakistan, and that the boy&#x27;s name was Ali Hassan. Discovering that she did not speak either of Afghanistan&#x27;s main languages, Pashto or Dari, the officers regarded her as suspicious. She told the police she was looking for her husband, needed no help, and started to walk away. She was arrested and taken to the police station for questioning. She initially claimed the boy was her stepson, Ali Hassan. The woman was not identified as Siddiqui until after she was fingerprinted. She subsequently admitted he was her biological son when DNA testing proved the boy to be Ahmed.

In a bag she was carrying, the police found a number of documents in English and Urdu describing how to make explosives, chemical weapons, Ebola, dirty bombs, and radiological agents, as well as the mortality rates of certain weapons and handwritten notes referring to a &quot;mass casualty attack&quot; that listed various US locations and landmarks (including the Plum Island Animal Disease Center, the Empire State Building, the Statue of Liberty, Wall Street, the Brooklyn Bridge, and the New York City subway system), according to her indictment. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; also mentioned one document about a &quot;theoretical&quot; biological weapon that did not harm children. She also reportedly had documents about American military bases, excerpts from a bombmaking manual, a one-gigabyte digital media storage device that contained over 500 electronic documents (including correspondence referring to attacks by &quot;cells&quot;, describing the US as an enemy, and discussing recruitment of &quot;jihadists&quot; and training), maps of Ghazni and the provincial governor&#x27;s compounds and nearby mosques, and photos of members of the Pakistani military. Other notes described various ways to attack enemies, including by destroying reconnaissance drones, using underwater bombs, and using gliders.

She also had &quot;numerous chemical substances in gel and liquid form that were sealed in bottles and glass jars&quot;, according to the later complaint against her, and about two pounds of sodium cyanide, a highly toxic poison. US prosecutors later said that sodium cyanide is lethal even when ingested in small doses, and various of the other chemicals she had could be used in explosives. Abdul Ghani, Ghazni&#x27;s deputy police chief, said she later confessed she had planned a suicide attack against the governor of Ghazni Province.

==== Explanation ====
Attempting to explain the timing of her January 2008 visit to her uncle and asking for help in contacting the Taliban in Afghanistan, and her reappearance in Ghazni in July later that year, journalist Deborah Scroggins noted that a breakdown in the &quot;long-standing alliance between the Deobandi jihadis and the military&quot; occurred in preceding months, which—if Siddiqui was in hiding rather than imprisoned—could have led to Siddiqui&#x27;s &quot;falling out with her secret government protectors&quot;. In 2007, a roving &quot;burka brigade&quot; of women based at Lal Mosque attempted to enforce sharia law in Islamabad. Attempts to stop them climaxed in July when at least 100 militants were killed by the military in the storming of the Lal Mosque. In the next five months, dozens of suicide attacks killing almost 2,000 people (including many soldiers) were executed in retaliation. Scroggins believed this bloodshed may have alienated any military protection Siddiqui had, and the role played by women of the &quot;burka brigade&quot; could have been seen by conservative Islamists as evidence of women causing &quot;fitna&quot; (strife).

On the other hand, supporters noted that Siddiqui&#x27;s reappearance &quot;loitering in Ghazni... less than two weeks&quot; after a press conference by Yvonne Ridley where Ridley alleged Siddiqui had been &quot;held in isolation by the Americans for more than four years&quot;, and which &quot;attracted enormous coverage&quot; especially in the Muslim world, seemed highly suspicious.

=== Shooting(s) in Ghazni ===
There are conflicting accounts of the events following her arrest in Ghazni. American authorities said that two FBI agents, a US Army warrant officer, a US Army captain, and their US military interpreters arrived in Ghazni the following day on 18 July to interview Siddiqui at the Afghan National Police facility where she was being held. They reported they congregated in a meeting room that was partitioned by a curtain, but did not realise that Siddiqui was standing unsecured behind the curtain. The warrant officer sat down and put his loaded M4 carbine on the floor by his feet near the curtain. Siddiqui drew back the curtain, picked up the rifle, and pointed it at the captain. &quot;I could see the barrel of the rifle, the inner portion of the barrel of the weapon; that indicated to me that it was pointed straight at my head,&quot; he said. Then, she was said to have threatened them loudly in English, and yelled &quot;Get the fuck out of here&quot; and &quot;May the blood of [unintelligible] be on your [head or hands]&quot;. The captain dove for cover to his left as she yelled &quot;Allah Akbar&quot; and fired at least two shots at them, missing them. An Afghan interpreter who was seated closest to her tried to disarm her. At that point, the warrant officer returned fire with a 9-millimeter pistol, hitting her in the torso, and one of the interpreters disarmed her. A Justice Department statement said that Siddiqui struck and kicked the officers during the ensuing struggle; &quot;she shout[ed] in English that she wanted to kill Americans&quot; and then lost consciousness.

Siddiqui related a different version of events, according to Pakistani senators who later visited her in jail. She denied touching a gun, shouting, or threatening anyone. She said she stood up to see who was on the other side of the curtain, and that after one of the startled soldiers shouted &quot;she is loose&quot;, she was shot. On regaining consciousness, she said someone said &quot;We could lose our jobs.&quot;

Some of the Afghan police offered a third version of the events, telling Reuters that US troops had demanded that she be handed over, disarmed the Afghans when they refused, and then shot Siddiqui mistakenly thinking she was a suicide bomber.

=== Hospital treatment and evaluation ===
Siddiqui was taken to U.S. military base Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan by helicopter in critical condition. When she arrived at the hospital, she was rated at 3 on the Glasgow Coma Scale, but she underwent surgery without complication. She was hospitalised at the Craig Theater Joint Hospital, and recovered over the next two weeks. According to FBI reports prepared after the operation, Siddiqui repeatedly denied shooting anyone. FBI reports maintained that Siddiqui told a US special agent at the Craig Hospital on or about 1 August that &quot;spewing bullets at soldiers is bad&quot;, and expressed surprise that she was being treated well.

While at the hospital, she was interrogated by an FBI agent every day for ten days for an &quot;average of eight hours&quot; a day. Her testimony was at odds with what Siddiqui later told lawyers and the court about what happened during her disappearance. Supporters complained that she was not Mirandized, nor did she have access to a Pakistani consular official, and that she was in a &quot;narcotic state&quot; at the time. She later told visiting Pakistani her statements might not look good to the Pakistani public but she had made them because her children had been threatened.

== Criminal complaint and trial ==
In pretrial activity, defense attorney Elaine Sharp said that the documents and item found on Siddiqui were planted. A government terrorism expert disagreed, stating there were &quot;hundred of pages in her own handwriting&quot;. In Pakistan, Siddiqui&#x27;s sister Fowzia accused the US of raping and torturing her sister and denying her medical treatment. The Pakistan National Assembly passed a unanimous resolution calling for Siddiqui&#x27;s repatriation.

Prior to her trial, Siddiqui said she was innocent of all charges. She maintained she could prove she was innocent but refused to do so in court. On 11 January 2010, Siddiqui told the judge that she would not co-operate with her attorneys and wanted to fire them. She said she did not trust the judge and added, &quot;I&#x27;m boycotting the trial, just to let all of you know. There&#x27;s too many injustices.&quot; She then put her head down on the defence table as the prosecution proceeded.

=== Charges ===
On 31 July 2008, while Siddiqui was still being treated in Afghanistan, she was charged in a sealed criminal complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York with assault with a deadly weapon and with attempting to kill a United States Army Captain &quot;while engaged in... official duties&quot;. In total, she was charged on two counts of attempted murder of US nationals, officers, and employees, assault with a deadly weapon, carrying and using a firearm, and three counts of assault on US officers and employees.

Explaining why the US may have chosen to charge her as they did rather than for her alleged terrorism, Bruce Hoffman, professor of security studies at Georgetown University, said: &quot;There&#x27;s no intelligence data that needs to be introduced, no sources and methods that need to be risked. It&#x27;s a good old-fashioned crime; it&#x27;s the equivalent of a 1920s gangster with a tommy gun.&quot;

Defense lawyer Sharp expressed skepticism regarding both the terrorism and assault charges: &quot;I think it&#x27;s interesting that they make all these allegations about the dirty bombs and other items she supposedly had, but they haven&#x27;t charged her with anything relating to terrorism... I would urge people to consider her as innocent unless the government proves otherwise.&quot;

=== Extradition and arraignment ===
On 4 August 2008, Siddiqui was placed on an FBI jet and flown to New York City after the Afghan government granted extradition to the United States for trial. She refused to appear for her arraignment or attend a hearing in September or meet with visitors. Siddiqui made her first appearance before a judge in a Manhattan courtroom on 6 August 2008 following which she was remanded into custody.

=== Medical treatment and psychological assessments ===
On 11 August, after her counsel maintained that Siddiqui had not seen a doctor since arriving in the US the previous week, US Magistrate Judge Henry B. Pitman ordered that she be examined by a medical doctor within 24 hours. Prosecutors maintained that Siddiqui had received adequate medical care for her gunshot wound but could not confirm whether she had been seen by a doctor or paramedic. The judge postponed her bail hearing until 3 September. An examination by a doctor the following day found no visible signs of infection; she also received a CAT scan.

Siddiqui was provided care for her wound while incarcerated in the US. In September 2008, a prosecutor reported to the court that Siddiqui had refused to be examined by a female doctor, despite the doctor&#x27;s extensive efforts. On 9 September 2008, she underwent a forced medical exam. In November 2008, forensic psychologist Leslie Powers reported that Siddiqui had been &quot;reluctant to allow medical staff to treat her&quot;. Her last medical exam had indicated her external wounds no longer required medical dressing and were healing well. A psychiatrist employed by the prosecutor to examine Siddiqui&#x27;s competence to stand trial, Gregory B. Saathoff, observed in a March 2009 report that Siddiqui frequently verbally and physically refused to allow the medical staff to check her vital signs and weight, attempted to refuse medical care once it was apparent that her wound had largely healed, and refused to take antibiotics. At the same time, Siddiqui claimed to her brother that when she needed medical treatment she did not get it, which Saathoff said he found no support for in his review of documents and interviews with medical and security personnel, nor in his interviews with Siddiqui.

Siddiqui&#x27;s trial was subject to delays, the longest being six months to perform psychiatric evaluations. She had been given routine mental health check-ups ten times in August and six times in September. She underwent three sets of psychological assessments before trial. Her first psychiatric evaluation diagnosed her with depressive psychosis, and her second evaluation, ordered by the court, revealed chronic depression. Leslie Powers initially determined Siddiqui mentally unfit to stand trial. After reviewing portions of FBI reports, however, she told the pre-trial judge she believed Siddiqui was faking mental illness.

In a third set of psychological assessments, more detailed than the previous two, three of four psychiatrists concluded that she was &quot;malingering&quot; (faking her symptoms of mental illness) and that she behaved normally when she thought the assessors were not looking. One suggested that this was to prevent criminal prosecution and to improve her chances of being returned to Pakistan. In April 2009, Manhattan federal judge Richard Berman held that she &quot;may have some mental health issues&quot; but was competent to stand trial.

While Khalid Sheikh Mohammad and other ghost prisoners had given the Red Cross &quot;elaborate descriptions of waterboardings and other tortures&quot; they had suffered, government psychiatrist Sally Johnson testified in a pre-trial hearing that Siddiqui had never given anyone, whether her brother, her lawyers, Pakistani senators or embassy personnel, other visitors, prison staff or psychiatrists, &quot;a clear account of any torture or imprisonment&quot;.

=== Antisemitism ===
A three-person defence team was hired by the Pakistani embassy to supplement her two existing public defenders, but Siddiqui refused to co-operate with them. She tried to dismiss her lawyers on the grounds that they were Jewish. She said the case against her was a Jewish conspiracy, demanded that no Jews be allowed on the jury, and that all prospective jurors be DNA-tested and excluded from the jury at her trial &quot;if they have a Zionist or Israeli background&quot;. She stated: &quot;they are all mad at me... I have a feeling everyone here is them—subject to genetic testing. They should be excluded, if you want to be fair.&quot; In regard to her comments, Siddiqui&#x27;s legal team stated that her incarceration had damaged her mind.She later claimed she was not against all &quot;Israeli Americans&quot;.

=== Trial proceedings ===
After 18 months of detention, Siddiqui&#x27;s trial began in New York City on 19 January 2010. Prior to the jury entering the courtroom, Siddiqui told onlookers that she would not work with her lawyers because the trial was a sham. She also said: &quot;I have information about attacks, more than 9/11!... I want to help the President to end this group, to finish them... They are a domestic, U.S. group; they are not Muslim.&quot;

Nine government witnesses were called by the prosecution. Army Captain Robert Snyder, John Threadcraft, a former army officer, and FBI agent John Jefferson testified first. As Snyder testified that Siddiqui had been arrested with a handwritten note outlining plans to attack various US sites, she interjected: &quot;Since I&#x27;ll never get a chance to speak... If you were in a secret prison... or your children were tortured... Give me a little credit, this is not a list of targets against New York. I was never planning to bomb it. You&#x27;re lying.&quot; The court also heard from FBI agent John Jefferson and Ahmed Gul, an army interpreter, who recounted their struggle with her. The judge disallowed as evidence her possession of chemicals and terror manuals and her alleged ties to al-Qaeda because they could have created an inappropriate bias.

Her defence argued that there was no forensic evidence that the rifle was fired in the interrogation room. They noted the nine government witnesses offered conflicting accounts of how many people were in the room, where they were positioned and how many shots were fired. It said that her handbag contents were not credible as evidence because they were sloppily handled. The prosecution argued that it was not unusual to fail to get fingerprints off a gun. &quot;This is a crime that was committed in a war zone, a chaotic and uncontrolled environment 6,000 miles away from here.&quot; Gul&#x27;s testimony appeared, according to the defence, to differ from that given by Snyder with regard to whether Siddiqui was standing or on her knees as she fired the rifle. When Siddiqui testified, she admitted trying to escape, but said she had not taken the rifle or fired any shots. She said she had been &quot;tortured in secret prisons&quot; before her arrest by a &quot;group of people pretending to be Americans, doing bad things in America&#x27;s name&quot;.

Siddiqui insisted on testifying at the trial against the advice of her lawyers. According to at least one source (Deborah Scroggins), Siddiqui &quot;avoided the question of where she had been for the last five years&quot; and her replies under cross examination may have damaged her credibility in jurists&#x27; eyes. In answer to prosecutor&#x27;s questions, she stated that the documents in her bag on terror plans and weapons had been given to her, and that she did not know that the boy who was with her in Ghazni was her son. When it was pointed out that the documents in her bag were in her own handwriting, she stated &quot;in a vague and halting manner&quot; that she had been forced to copy them out of a magazine so that her children would not be tortured. When questioned about taking a firearms course, she stated that &quot;everyone used to take it&quot;. The pistol safety instructor then testified that he remembered teaching her how to fire &quot;hundreds of rounds&quot;. In his closing arguments, the prosecutor told the jury that Siddiqui had &quot;raised her right hand&quot; and &quot;lied to your face&quot;.

During the trial, Siddiqui was removed from the court several times for repeatedly interrupting the proceedings with shouting; on being ejected, she was told by the judge that she could watch the proceedings on closed-circuit television in an adjacent holding cell. A request by the defence lawyers to declare a mistrial was turned down by the judge. Amnesty International monitored the trial for fairness.

=== Conviction ===

The trial lasted 14 days with the jury deliberating for three days before reaching a verdict. On 3 February 2010, Siddiqui was found guilty of two counts of attempted murder, armed assault, using and carrying a firearm, and three counts of assault on US officers and employees. After jurors found Siddiqui guilty, she exclaimed: &quot;This is a verdict coming from Israel, not America. That&#x27;s where the anger belongs.&quot;

She faced a minimum sentence of 30 years and a maximum of life in prison on the firearm charge, and could also have received a sentence of up to 20 years for each attempted murder and armed assault charge, and up to 8 years on each of the remaining assault counts. Her lawyers requested a 12-year sentence, instead of the life sentence recommended by the probation office. They argued that mental illness drove her actions when she attempted to escape from the Afghan National Police station &quot;by any means available... what she viewed as a horrific fate&quot;. Her lawyers also claimed her mental illness was on display during her trial outbursts and boycotts, and that she was &quot;first and foremost&quot; the victim of her own irrational behaviour. The sentencing hearing set to take place on 6 May 2010 was rescheduled for mid-August 2010 and then September 2010.

=== Sentencing ===

Siddiqui was sentenced to 86 years in prison by Judge Berman on 23 September 2010. During the sentencing hearing, which lasted one hour, Siddiqui spoke on her own behalf. Upon hearing the verdict, she turned to trial spectators and told them that &quot;this verdict coming from Israel and not from America&quot;.

A reporter for &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that at times during the hearing Judge Berman seemed to be speaking to an audience beyond the courtroom in an apparent attempt to address widespread speculation about Siddiqui and her case. He gave as an example a reference to the five-year period before her 2008 arrest of Siddiqui&#x27;s disappearance and claims of torture, where the judge said: &quot;I am aware of no evidence in the record to substantiate these allegations or to establish them as fact. There is no credible evidence in the record that the United States officials and/or agencies detained Dr. Siddiqui&quot;. In sentencing her, Berman repeated the prosecution witnesses&#x27; claim that while she shot at Americans with an M-4 rifle she had said &quot;I want to kill Americans&quot; and &quot;Death to America&quot;. Siddiqui said she forgave the soldier who had shot her, as well as the judge. She told the court: &quot;I am a Muslim, but I do love America, too. I do not want any bloodshed. I really want to make peace and end the wars.&quot;

At the time of sentencing, Siddiqui did not show any interest in filing an appeal, instead saying &quot;I appeal to God and he hears me.&quot; After she was sentenced, she urged forgiveness and asked the public not to take any action in retaliation. She stated, &quot;forgive everybody in my case, please... Don&#x27;t get angry. If I&#x27;m not angry, why should anyone else be?&quot; In a notably gracious exchange between the bestower and recipient of an 80+ year sentence of incarceration, the judge wished her &quot;the very best going forward&quot;, and both Siddiqui and the judge thanked each other.

=== Imprisonment ===
Siddiqui (Federal Bureau of Prisons #90279-054) was originally held at Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn. She is now being held in Federal Medical Center, Carswell in Fort Worth, Texas, a federal prison for female inmates with special mental health needs, and also relatively close to the home of her brother Ali Siddiqui. Her release date is 30 June 2082. She was visited by her sister Fowzia Siddiqui in May 2023, accompanied by human rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith and Jamaat-e-Islami senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan.

=== Children ===
According to &quot;Arab News&quot;, Pakistan&#x27;s president, Asif Ali Zardari, had personally requested Afghanistan&#x27;s president Hamid Karzai return Dr. Aafia&#x27;s children, including Ahmed (born 1996), to their family in Pakistan. In the summer of 2008 Aafia and a teenage boy were reported to have been apprehended by Afghan police. It was later confirmed that the teenage boy was her eldest son Ahmed. On 26 August 2008, the United States Department of State confirmed that the youth captured with Aafia Siddiqi on 17 July 2008 was her son, American citizen Ahmed Siddiqi. Ahmed was transferred to the custody of Pakistani security officials. Joanne Mariner, then Director of the Terrorism and Counterterrorism Program at Human Rights Watch, criticized Afghanistan officials for transferring Ahmed to the National Directorate of Security due to its reputation for using torture as an interrogation tool. Mariner pointed out that under Afghan law Ahmed was too young to be held criminally responsible. Ahmed was released from Afghanistan to his aunt in Pakistan following enormous outcry from the Pakistani public and politicians. While Pakistani law would normally give his father custody, his father did not want to fight the passionate public opinion supporting his aunt Fowzia. , he was living with his aunt in Karachi; Fowzia prohibited him from talking to the press at that time.

In late August 2010, British journalist Yvonne Ridley, who had first reported that Aafia and her children had been held in the Bagram Theater internment facility reported that she had acquired a statement taken from Ahmed in 2008.
She reported that the statement was taken from Ahmed by an American official when he was released. The statement is the first from Ahmed. The statement is the first to appear to confirm Aafia&#x27;s dream that her youngest child was dead. The statement, as quoted by Ridley, read:

I do not remember the date but it seems a long time ago i remember we were going to Islamabad in a car when we were stopped by different cars and high roof ones. My mother was screaming and I was screaming as they took me away, I looked around and saw my baby brother on the ground and there was blood. My mother was crying and screaming. Then they put something on my face. I smelt and don&#x27;t remember anything.

I woke up I was in a room. There were American soldiers in uniform and plain clothes people. They kept me in different places. If I cried or didn&#x27;t listen, they beat me and tied me and chained me. There were English speaking, Pashto and Urdu speaking. I had no courage to ask who they were. At times, for a long time, I was alone in a small room. Then I was taken to some children&#x27;s prison where there were lots of other children.

The American Consular, who came to me in Kabul jail, said, &#x27;Your name is Ahmed. You are American. Your mother&#x27;s name is Aafia Siddiqui and your younger brother is dead. After that they took me away from the kids&#x27; prison and I met the Pakistani consular , and I talked to my aunt (Fowzia Siddiqui). 
When a girl who may have been his younger sister Maryam was returned to the Ahmed&#x27;s family, tests to confirm her identity were inconclusive.
His aunt Fowzia expressed doubt that the girl was her niece Maryam. In April 2010, Pakistan Interior Minister Rehman Malik claimed a 12-year-old girl found outside a house in Karachi was identified by DNA as Siddiqui&#x27;s daughter, Mariyam, and that she had been returned to her family. The &quot;Daily Times&quot; reported that the girl was only able to speak English and Dari, a dialect of the Persian language, and that when Ahmed was returned he too could only speak English and Dari.

Their father and his parents have not been allowed to see either child.

== Reactions ==
=== Attacks and threats ===
For al-Qaeda and Pakistani jihadi groups, Siddiqui&#x27;s case became a &quot;rallying cry&quot; and they joined in accusing the Pakistani government and military of failing to protect and avenge her.

According to a video released by Hakimullah Mehsud, head of the TTP (Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan) at the time, the 2009 Camp Chapman attack in Afghanistan that killed seven CIA officers was partly in revenge for Aafia&#x27;s imprisonment. The 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt occurred one day after Mehsud released another video promising to avenge Siddiqui. The perpetrator of the attempt was Faisal Shahzad, a recently naturalized Pakistan-born citizen who had contacts with Jaish-e-Muhammad and Hakimullah Mehsud.

According to a February 2010 report in the Pakistani newspaper &quot;The News International&quot;, the Taliban threatened to execute US soldier Bowe Bergdahl, whom they had captured on 30 June 2009 in retaliation for Siddiqui&#x27;s conviction. A Taliban spokesperson claimed that members of Siddiqui&#x27;s family had requested help from the Taliban to obtain her release from prison in the US. Bergdahl was released on 31 May 2014 in exchange for five Guantanamo Bay detainees.

In September 2010, the Taliban kidnapped Linda Norgrove, a Scottish aid worker in Afghanistan, and Taliban commanders insisted Norgrove would be handed over only in exchange for Siddiqui.
On 8 October 2010, Norgrove was accidentally killed during a rescue attempt by a grenade thrown by one of her rescuers.

In July 2011, then-deputy of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, Waliur Rehman, announced that they wanted to swap Siddiqui for two Swiss citizens abducted in Balochistan. The Swiss couple escaped in March 2012.

In December 2011, al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri demanded the release of Siddiqui in exchange for Warren Weinstein, an American aid worker kidnapped in Pakistan on 13 August 2011. Weinstein was accidentally killed in a drone strike in January 2015.

In January 2013, al-Qaeda-linked terrorists involved in the Algerian In Amenas hostage crisis listed the release of Siddiqui as one of their demands.

In June 2013, the captors of two Czech women kidnapped in Pakistan demanded the release of Siddiqui in exchange for the two captives. Both Czech women were released in March 2015, following intense negotiations by a Turkish NGO IHH.

In August 2014, it was reported that the terrorist who claimed responsibility for the beheading of U.S. photojournalist James Foley mentioned Siddiqui in an email to Foley&#x27;s family. Siddiqui was identified in the email as one of the Muslim &quot;sisters&quot; the Islamic State was purportedly willing to swap as part of a prisoner exchange with the United States.

In February 2015, Paul Gosar said the family of Kayla Mueller had been told plans to swap her for Siddiqui were underway in the months before her death. ISIS had also demanded $6.6 million in exchange for Mueller.

In March 2017, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula leader Qasim al-Raymi said that his group demanded the release of Siddiqui in exchange for Luke Somers, an American journalist kidnapped in Yemen in September 2013. Somers was killed during a rescue attempt in December 2014.

In January 2022, a man claiming to be Siddiqui&#x27;s brother took hostages at the Beth Israel synagogue in Colleyville, Texas, near where she is imprisoned, and demanded her release. He was later shot and killed by police, and the hostages were rescued.

=== Pakistan ===
The case was covered very differently in Pakistan than in the United States.

After Siddiqui&#x27;s conviction, she sent a message through her lawyer, saying that she does not want &quot;violent protests or violent reprisals in Pakistan over this verdict.&quot; Thousands of students, political and social activists protested in Pakistan. Some shouted anti-American slogans, while burning the American flag and effigies of President Barack Obama in the streets. Her sister has spoken frequently and passionately on her behalf at rallies. Echoing her family&#x27;s comments and anti-US sentiment, many believe she was detained in Karachi in 2003, held at the US Bagram Airbase and tortured, and that the charges against her were fabricated.

Her conviction was followed with expressions of support by many Pakistanis, who appeared increasingly anti-American, as well as by politicians and the news media, who characterised her as a symbol of victimisation by the United States. Graffiti &quot;Free Dr. Aafia&quot; appeared &quot;even in remote areas&quot; of the country.

The Pakistani Embassy in Washington, D.C., expressed its dismay over the verdict, which followed &quot;intense diplomatic and legal efforts on her behalf. [We] will consult the family of Dr. Aafia Siddiqui and the team of defence lawyers to determine the future course of action.&quot; Prime Minister Gilani described Siddiqui as a &quot;daughter of the nation,&quot; and opposition leader Nawaz Sharif promised to push for her release. Shireen Mazari, editor of the Pakistani newspaper &quot;The Nation&quot;, wrote that the verdict &quot;did not really surprise anyone familiar with the vindictive mindset of the U.S. public post-9/11&quot;.

A few Pakistanis questioned the outpouring of support. Her ex-husband said Siddiqui was &quot;reaping the fruit of her own decision. Her family has been portraying Aafia as a victim. We would like the truth to come out.&quot; Shakil Chaudhry lamented the &quot;mass hysteria&quot; of supporters. But when one columnist (Mubashir Lucman) raised questions about Asfia&#x27;s sister Fowzia&#x27;s account, graffiti &quot;appeared all over Karachi insulting&quot; him.

US observers noted the Pakistani reaction. Jessica Eve Stern, a terrorism specialist and lecturer at Harvard Law School, observed: &quot;Whatever the truth is, this case is of great political importance because of how people [in Pakistan] view her.&quot; &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; reported that unsubstantiated rumours, widely repeated in the Pakistani press, that she had been sexually abused by her captors had &quot;become part of the legend that surrounds her, so much so that they are repeated as established facts by her supporters, who have helped build her iconic status&quot; as a folk hero.
According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;,
Journalist Scroggins complained about the lack of curiosity and investigation by Pakistani public and press of a number of questions about the case—how Siddiqui&#x27;s daughter Maryam turned up at her grandmother&#x27;s house and where she had been, what connection the &quot;Karachi Institute of Technology&quot;, and the cleric Abu Lubaba had had with Aafia. She noted that while thousands of Pakistanis had been killed by bomb and assassinations in tribal areas, in contrast to the rage against the US, no rallies were held in protest of jihadi attacks (Scroggins argued) because Pakistanis were fearful of them.

==Repatriation efforts==
In August 2009, Pakistani Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani met with Siddiqui&#x27;s sister at his residence and assured her that Pakistan would seek Siddiqui&#x27;s release from the US. The Pakistani government paid $2 million for the services of three lawyers to assist in the defense of Siddiqui during her trial. Many Siddiqui supporters were present during the proceedings, and outside the court dozens of people rallied to demand her release.

In February 2010, President Asif Ali Zardari requested of Richard Holbrooke, US Special Envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan, that the US consider repatriating Siddiqui to Pakistan under the Pakistan-US Prisoner Exchange Agreement. On 22 February, the Pakistani Senate urged the government to work towards her immediate release.

In September 2010, Pakistan Interior Minister Rehman Malik sent a letter to the United States Attorney General calling for repatriation of Siddiqui to Pakistan. He said that the case of Siddiqui had become a matter of public concern in Pakistan and her repatriation would create goodwill for the US.

In July 2019, after meeting with United States President Donald Trump, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan told the media that releasing Shakeel Afridi in exchange for Siddiqui was a possibility.

On 6 July 2024, the Islamabad High Court ruled that the government must create a plan to repatriate Siddiqui by 26 August. On 2 November, Attorney General of Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan informed the Islamabad High Court that a Pakistani delegation is scheduled to visit the United States following the presidential elections to negotiate the release of Siddiqui.

On 17 September 2024, Siddiqui&#x27;s lawyers filed a clemency petition with President Joe Biden, seeking her release, or her exchange for Dr. Shakeel Afridi. The petition runs to 56,600 words, canvassing the whole history of her case. Her lawyers also filed an extensive analysis of her prison record, reflecting the failure by the Bureau of Prisons to provide her with basic medical care, as well as the various punishments imposed upon her for claiming to be the victim of rape – punishments that her lawyers claim were imposed on a whistleblower in violation of the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA).

<text>Vinci ( , ) is a of the Metropolitan City of Florence in the Italian region of Tuscany. The birthplace of Renaissance polymath Leonardo da Vinci lies just outside the town.

==Physical geography==

Vinci is situated on the slopes of Montalbano, a hilly massif rich in vineyards and olive groves, characterized by terraces supported by distinctive dry stone walls.

The oldest part of Vinci has an almond-shaped layout, which is unusual for this area of Tuscany. Viewed from above, it resembles a two-masted boat (with the two masts being the tower of the Rocca dei Conti Guidi and the bell tower of the church of Santa Croce). For this reason, the historic center of Vinci is also known as “Castel della Nave” (Castle of the Ship).
