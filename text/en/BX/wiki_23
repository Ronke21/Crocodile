<text>An injection (often and usually referred to as a &quot;shot&quot; in US English, a &quot;jab&quot; in UK English, or a &quot;jag&quot; in Scottish English and Scots) is the act of administering a liquid, especially a drug, into a person&#x27;s body using a needle (usually a hypodermic needle) and a syringe. An injection is considered a form of parenteral drug administration; it does not involve absorption in the digestive tract. This allows the medication to be absorbed more rapidly and avoid the first pass effect. There are many types of injection, which are generally named after the body tissue the injection is administered into. This includes common injections such as subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous injections, as well as less common injections such as epidural, intraperitoneal, intraosseous, intracardiac, intraarticular, and intracavernous injections.

Injections are among the most common health care procedures, with at least 16 billion administered in developing and transitional countries each year. Of these, 95% are used in curative care or as treatment for a condition, 3% are to provide immunizations/vaccinations, and the rest are used for other purposes, including blood transfusions. The term &quot;injection&quot; is sometimes used synonymously with inoculation, but injection does not only refer to the act of inoculation. Injections generally administer a medication as a bolus (or one-time) dose, but can also be used for continuous drug administration. After injection, a medication may be designed to be released slowly, called a depot injection, which can produce long-lasting effects.

An injection necessarily causes a small puncture wound to the body, and thus may cause localized pain or infection. The occurrence of these side effects varies based on injection location, the substance injected, needle gauge, procedure, and individual sensitivity. Rarely, more serious side effects including gangrene, sepsis, and nerve damage may occur. Fear of needles, also called needle phobia, is also common and may result in anxiety and fainting before, during, or after an injection. To prevent the localized pain that occurs with injections the injection site may be numbed or cooled before injection and the person receiving the injection may be distracted by a conversation or similar means. To reduce the risk of infection from injections, proper aseptic technique should be followed to clean the injection site before administration. If needles or syringes are reused between people, or if an accidental needlestick occurs, there is a risk of transmission of bloodborne diseases such as HIV and hepatitis.

Unsafe injection practices contribute to the spread of bloodborne diseases, especially in less-developed countries. To combat this, safety syringes exist which contain features to prevent accidental needlestick injury and reuse of the syringe after it is used once. Furthermore, recreational drug users who use injections to administer the drugs commonly share or reuse needles after an injection. This has led to the development of needle exchange programs and safe injection sites as a public health measure, which may provide new, sterile syringes and needles to discourage the reuse of syringes and needles. Used needles should ideally be placed in a purpose-made sharps container which is safe and resistant to puncture. Some locations provide free disposal programs for such containers for their citizens.
== Types ==

Injections are classified in multiple ways, including the type of tissue being injected into, the location in the body the injection is designed to produce effects, and the duration of the effects. Regardless of classification, injections require a puncture to be made, thus requiring sterile environments and procedures to minimize the risk of introducing pathogens into the body. All injections are considered forms of parenteral administration, which avoids the first pass metabolism which would potentially affect a medication absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract.

===Systemic===
Many injections are designed to administer a medication which has an effect throughout the body. Systemic injections may be used when a person cannot take medicine by mouth, or when the medication itself would not be absorbed into circulation from the gastrointestinal tract. Medications administered via a systemic injection will enter into blood circulation, either directly or indirectly, and thus will have an effect on the entire body.

==== Intravenous ====
Intravenous injections, abbreviated as IV, involve inserting a needle into a vein, allowing a substance to be delivered directly into the bloodstream. An intravenous injection provides the quickest onset of the desired effects because the substance immediately enters the blood, and is quickly circulated to the rest of the body. Because the substance is administered directly into the bloodstream, there is no delay in the onset of effects due to the absorption of the substance into the bloodstream. This type of injection is the most common and is used frequently for administration of medications in an inpatient setting.

Another use for intravenous injections includes for the administration of nutrition to people who cannot get nutrition through the digestive tract. This is termed parenteral nutrition and may provide all or only part of a person&#x27;s nutritional requirements. Parenteral nutrition may be pre-mixed or customized for a person&#x27;s specific needs. Intravenous injections may also be used for recreational drugs when a rapid onset of effects is desired.

==== Intramuscular ====
Intramuscular injections, abbreviated as IM, deliver a substance deep into a muscle, where they are quickly absorbed by the blood vessels into systemic circulation. Common injection sites include the deltoid, vastus lateralis, and ventrogluteal muscles. Medical professionals are trained to give IM injections, but people who are not medical professionals can also be trained to administer medications like epinephrine using an autoinjector in an emergency. Some depot injections are also administered intramuscularly, including medroxyprogesterone acetate among others. In addition to medications, most inactivated vaccines, including the influenza vaccine, are given as an IM injection.

==== Subcutaneous ====
Subcutaneous injections, abbreviated as SC or sub-Q, consist of injecting a substance via a needle under the skin. Absorption of the medicine from this tissue is slower than in an intramuscular injection. Since the needle does not need to penetrate to the level of the muscle, a thinner and shorter needle can be used. Subcutaneous injections may be administered in the fatty tissue behind the upper arm, in the abdomen, or in the thigh. Certain medications, including epinephrine, may be used either intramuscularly or subcutaneously. Others, such as insulin, are almost exclusively injected subcutaneously. Live or attenuated vaccines, including the MMR vaccine (measles, mumps, rubella), varicella vaccine (chickenpox), and zoster vaccine (shingles) are also injected subcutaneously.

==== Intradermal ====

Intradermal injections, abbreviated as ID, consist of a substance delivered into the dermis, the layer of skin above the subcutaneous fat layer, but below the epidermis or top layer. An intradermal injection is administered with the needle placed almost flat against the skin, at a 5 to 15 degree angle. Absorption from an intradermal injection takes longer than when the injection is given intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously. For this reason, few medications are administered intradermally. Intradermal injections are most commonly used for sensitivity tests, including tuberculin skin tests and allergy tests, as well as sensitivity tests to medications a person has never had before. The reactions caused by tests which use intradermal injection are more easily seen due to the location of the injection, and when positive will present as a red or swollen area. Common sites of intradermal injections include the forearm and lower back.

==== Intraosseous ====
An intraosseous injection or infusion is the act of administering medication through a needle inserted into the bone marrow of a large bone. This method of administration is only used when it is not possible to maintain access through a less invasive method such as an intravenous line, either due to frequent loss of access due to a collapsed vessel, or due to the difficulty of finding a suitable vein to use in the first place. Intraosseous access is commonly obtained by inserting a needle into the bone marrow of the humerus or tibia, and is generally only considered once multiple attempts at intravenous access have failed, as it is a more invasive method of administration than an IV. With the exception of occasional differences in the accuracy of blood tests when drawn from an intraosseous line, it is considered to be equivalent in efficacy to IV access. It is most commonly used in emergency situations where there is not ample time to repeatedly attempt to obtain IV access, or in younger people for whom obtaining IV access is more difficult.

=== Localized ===
Injections may be performed into specific parts of the body when the medication&#x27;s effects are desired to be limited to a specific location, or where systemic administration would produce undesirable side effects which may be avoided by a more directed injection.

Injections to the corpus cavernosum of the penis, termed intracavernous injections, may be used to treat conditions which are localized to the penis. They can be self-administered for erectile dysfunction prior to intercourse or used in a healthcare setting for emergency treatment for a prolonged erection with an injection to either remove blood from the penis or to administer a sympathomimetic medication to reduce the erection. Intracavernosal injections of alprostadil may be used by people for whom other treatments such as PDE5 inhibitors are ineffective or contraindicated. Other medications may also be administered in this way, including papaverine, phentolamine, and aviptadil. The most common adverse effects of intercavernosal injections include fibrosis and pain, as well as hematomas or bruising around the injection site.

Medications may also be administered by injecting them directly into the vitreous humor of the eye. This is termed an intravitreal injection, and may be used to treat endophthalmitis (an infection of the inner eye), macular degeneration, and macular edema. An intravitreal injection is performed by injecting a medication through the pupil into the vitreous humor core of the eye after applying a local anesthetic drop to numb the eye and a mydriatic drop to dilate the pupil. They are commonly used in lieu of systemic administration to both increase the concentrations present in the eye, as well as avoid systemic side effects of medications.

When an effect is only required in one joint, a joint injection (or intra-articular injection) may be administered into the articular space surrounding the joint. These injections can range from a one-time dose of a steroid to help with pain and inflammation to complete replacement of the synovial fluid with a compound such as hyaluronic acid. The injection of a steroid into a joint is used to reduce inflammation associated with conditions such as osteoarthritis, and the effects may last for up to 6 months following a single injection. Hyaluronic acid injection is used to supplement the body&#x27;s natural synovial fluid and decrease the friction and stiffness of the joint. Administering a joint injection generally involves the use of an ultrasound or other live imaging technique to ensure the injection is administered in the desired location, as well as to reduce the risk of damaging surrounding tissues.

=== Long-acting ===
Long-acting injectable (LAI) formulations of medications are not intended to have a rapid effect, but instead release a medication at a predictable rate continuously over a period of time. Both depot injections and solid injectable implants are used to increase adherence to therapy by reducing the frequency at which a person must take a medication.

==== Depot ====

A depot injection is an injection, usually subcutaneous, intradermal, or intramuscular, that deposits a drug in a localized mass, called a depot, from which it is gradually absorbed by surrounding tissue. Such injection allows the active compound to be released in a consistent way over a long period. Depot injections are usually either oil-based or an aqueous suspension. Depot injections may be available as certain salt forms of a drug, such as decanoate salts or esters. Examples of depot injections include haloperidol decanoate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and naltrexone.

==== Implant ====

Injections may also be used to insert a solid or semi-solid into the body which releases a medication slowly over time. These implants are generally designed to be temporary, replaceable, and ultimately removed at the end of their use or when replaced. There are multiple contraceptive implants marketed for different active ingredients, as well as differing duration of action - most of these are injected under the skin. A form of buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid dependence is also available as an injectable implant. Various materials can be used to manufacture implants including biodegradable polymers, osmotic release systems, and small spheres which dissolve in the body.

==Adverse effects==
===Pain===
The act of piercing the skin with a needle, while necessary for an injection, also may cause localized pain. The most common technique to reduce the pain of an injection is simply to distract the person receiving the injection. Pain may be dampened by prior application of ice or topical anesthetic, or pinching of the skin while giving the injection. Some studies also suggest that forced coughing during an injection stimulates a transient rise in blood pressure which inhibits the perception of pain. For some injections, especially deeper injections, a local anesthetic is given. When giving an injection to young children or infants, they may be distracted by giving them a small amount of sweet liquid, such as sugar solution, or be comforted by breastfeeding during the injection, which reduces crying.

=== Infection ===
A needle tract infection, also called a needlestick infection, is an infection that occurs when pathogens are inadvertently introduced into the tissues of the body during an injection. Contamination of the needle used for injection, or reuse of needles for injections in multiple people, can lead to transmission of hepatitis B and C, HIV, and other bloodstream infections. Injection drug users have high rates of unsafe needle use including sharing needles between people. The spread of HIV, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C from injection drug use is a common health problem, in particular contributing to over half of new HIV cases in North America in 1994.

Other infections may occur when pathogens enter the body through the injection site, most commonly due to improper cleaning of the site before injection. Infections occurring in this way are mainly localized infections, including skin infections, skin structure infections, abscesses, or gangrene. An intravenous injection may also result in a bloodstream infection (termed sepsis) if the injection site is not cleaned properly prior to insertion. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition which requires immediate treatment.

=== Others ===
Injections into the skin and soft tissue generally do not cause any permanent damage, and the puncture heals within a few days. However, in some cases, injections can cause long-term adverse effects. Intravenous and intramuscular injections may cause damage to a nerve, leading to palsy or paralysis. Intramuscular injections may cause fibrosis or contracture. Injections also cause localized bleeding, which may lead to a hematoma. Intravenous injections may also cause phlebitis, especially when multiple injections are given in a vein over a short period of time. Infiltration and extravasation may also occur when a medication intended to be injected into a vein is inadvertently injected into surrounding tissues. Those who are afraid of needles may also experience fainting at the sight of a needle, or before or after an injection.

==Technique==
Proper needle use is important to perform injections safely, which includes the use of a new, sterile needle for each injection. This is partly because needles get duller with each use and partly because reusing needles increases risk of infection. Needles should not be shared between people, as this increases risk of transmitting blood-borne pathogens. The practice of using the same needle for multiple people increases the risk of disease transmission between people sharing the same medication. In addition, it is not recommended to reuse a used needle to pierce a medication bag, bottle, or ampule designed to provide multiple doses of a medication, instead a new needle should be used each time the container must be pierced. Aseptic technique should always be practiced when administering injections. This includes the use of barriers including gloves, gowns, and masks for health care providers. It also requires the use of a new, sterile needle, syringe and other equipment for each injection, as well as proper training to avoid touching non-sterile surfaces with sterile items.

To help prevent accidental needlestick injury to the person administering the injection, and prevent reuse of the syringe for another injection, a safety syringe and needle may be used. The most basic reuse prevention device is an &quot;auto-disable&quot; plunger, which once pressed past a certain point will no longer retract. Another common safety feature is an auto-retractable needle, where the needle is spring-loaded and either retracts into the syringe after injection, or into a plastic sheath on the side of the syringe. Other safety syringes have an attached sheath which may be moved to cover the end of the needle after the injection is given. The World Health Organization recommends the use of single-use syringes with both reuse prevention devices and a needlestick injury prevention mechanism for all injections to prevent accidental injury and disease transmission.

Novel injection techniques include drug diffusion within the skin using needle-free micro-jet injection (NFI) technology.

===Disposal of used needles===
Used needles should be disposed of in specifically designed sharps containers to reduce the risk of accidental needle sticks and exposure to other people. In addition, a new sharps container should be begun once it is full. A sharps container which is filled should be sealed properly to prevent re-opening or accidental opening during transportation. Some locations offer publicly accessible &quot;sharps take-back&quot; programs where a sharps container may be dropped off to a public location for safe disposal at no fee to the person. In addition, some pharmaceutical and independent companies provide mail-back sharps programs, sometimes for an additional fee. In the United States, there are 39 states that offer programs to provide needle or syringe exchange.

Over half of non-industrialized countries report open burning of disposed or used syringes. This practice is considered unsafe by the World Health Organization.

=== Aspiration ===
The aspiration is the technique of pulling back on the plunger of a syringe prior to the actual injection. If blood flows into the syringe it signals that a blood vessel has been hit.

== Society and culture ==
Due to the prevalence of unsafe injection practices, especially among injection drug users, many locations have begun offering supervised injection sites and needle exchange programs, which may be offered separately or colocated. These programs may provide new sterile needles upon request to mitigate infection risk, and some also provide access to on-site clinicians and emergency medical care if it becomes required. In the event of an overdose, a site may also provide medications such as naloxone, used as an antidote in opioid overdose situations, or other antidotes or emergency care. Safe injection site have been associated with lower rates of death from overdose, less ambulance calls, and lower rates of new HIV infections from unsafe needle practices.

As of 2024, at least ten countries currently offer safe injection sites, including Australia, Canada, the United States, Denmark, France, Germany, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Switzerland. In total, there are at least 120 sites operating. 

== Plants and animals ==
Many species of animals use injections for self-defence or catching prey. This includes venomous snakes which inject venom when they bite into the skin with their fangs. Common substances present in snake venom include neurotoxins, toxic proteins, and cytotoxic enzymes. Different species of snakes inject different formulations of venom, which may cause severe pain and necrosis before progressing into neurotoxicity and potentially death. The weever is a type of fish which has venomous spines covering its fins and gills and injects a venom consisting of proteins which cause a severe local reaction which is not life-threatening. Sting rays use their spinal blade to inject a protein-based venom which causes localized cell death but is not generally life-threatening.

Some types of insects also utilize injection for various purposes. Bees use a stinger located in their hind region to inject a venom consisting of proteins such as melittin, which causes a localized painful and itching reaction. Leeches can inject an anticoagulant peptide called hirudin after attaching to prevent blood from clotting during feeding. This property of leeches has been used historically as a natural form of anticoagulation therapy, as well as for the use of bloodletting as a treatment for various ailments. Some species of ants inject forms of venom which include compounds which produce minor pain such as the formic acid, which is injected by members of the Formicinae subfamily. Other species of ants, including &quot;Dinoponera&quot; species, inject protein-based venom which causes severe pain but is still not life-threatening. The bullet ant (&quot;Paraponera clavata&quot;) injects a venom which contains a neurotoxin named poneratoxin which causes extreme pain, fever, and cold sweats, and may cause arrhythmias.

Plants may use a form of injection which is passive, where the injectee pushes themselves against the stationary needle. The stinging nettle plant has many trichomes, or stinging hairs, over its leaves and stems which are used to inject a mix of irritating chemicals which includes histamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine. This sting produces a form of dermatitis which is characterized by a stinging, burning, and itching sensation in the area. &quot;Dendrocnide&quot; species, also called stinging trees, use their trichomes to inject a mix of neurotoxic peptides which causes a reaction similar to the stinging nettle, but also may result in recurring flares for a much longer period after the injection. While some plants have thorns, spines, and prickles, these generally are not used for injection of any substance, but instead it is the act of piercing the skin which causes them to be a deterrent.

<doc id="665946" wikidata="Q1218517" url="?curid=665946" title="The Big Brawl">
<text>The Big Brawl (, also released as Battle Creek Brawl) is a 1980 martial arts action comedy film which marked Jackie Chan&#x27;s first attempt to break into the American movie Hollywood market. A joint Hong Kong and American co-production, it was directed by American filmmaker Robert Clouse and featured much of the crew from &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; (1973), which was also produced by Golden Harvest Studios. The film also co-stars Mako, Kristine DeBell, and José Ferrer.

The film is set primarily in Chicago, Illinois in the 1930s (although it was shot in Texas) and follows Chan&#x27;s character, a Chinese American martial artist, as he single-handedly takes on the Mafia, leading to a no-holds-barred street fighting tournament that culminates in a battle royale survival brawl.

While a moderate success in North America and Hong Kong, &quot;The Big Brawl&quot; was a box office disappointment as it performed below expectations in these markets, though it went on to have more success in other Asian and European markets. The film&#x27;s disappointing performance in North America, however, led to Chan being advised to try supporting roles such as the Chinese racing car driver in &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot;. Chan later made another attempt to break into the American market with 1985&#x27;s &quot;The Protector&quot;, which performed worse than this film. It was not until 1995 with &quot;Rumble in the Bronx&quot; that a Chan film showcasing his signature humor and stunt-work was a major hit in American theaters.

==Plot==
In 1930s Chicago, Chinese immigrant Jerry Kwan leads a very easy-going life with his white girlfriend, Nancy, and his family. His father owns a restaurant, and one day, he is threatened by the mob to pay a part of his profits. As the mob exits, Jerry enters the scene and rushes out the door to catch up with them. He answers back by taking them on and eventually catches the eye of the mob for his unique fighting skills, learned from his eccentric chiropractor uncle Herbert. Mobster boss Dominici has been looking for a fighter to defeat his rival Morgan&#x27;s champion, Billy Kiss - whose trademark &quot;Kiss of Death&quot; finishing move is to kiss his opponents while killing them with a crushing bear hug.

Dominici&#x27;s gang kidnaps Jerry&#x27;s brother&#x27;s fiancée to coerce Jerry into fighting for them in the Battle Creek Brawl, a no-rules, all-in street fighting tournament in Texas. The mob promises to return his brother&#x27;s fiancée and give him the prize money as long as Jerry wins the tournament. After a failed rescue attempt, Uncle Herbert trains Jerry, concentrating on speed and agility as he must fight much larger and stronger opponents. Jerry, Herbert and Nancy travel to Battle Creek and, after surviving a massive battle royale elimination round and then winning a series of single combats, Jerry ultimately wins the Brawl by defeating Billy Kiss. The mob returns the kidnapped fiancée and all ends happily.

==Production==
&quot;The Big Brawl&quot; was the first attempt to market Jackie Chan to a Western film audience. Though Chan was already a major star in East Asian markets, he remained a relative obscurity in North America, outside of the import market. Golden Harvest mogul Raymond Chow hoped to replicate the success of Bruce Lee, whom Chan was often compared to early on, in &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;. To that end, he hired much of the same crew as &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;, including director Robert Clouse, producer Fred Weintraub, musical composer Lalo Schifrin, and editor Peter Cheung.

In his autobiography &quot;I Am Jackie Chan&quot;, Chan said that he appeared in the film during a self-imposed exile in America, due to a dispute with director Lo Wei, who was purported to have Triad connections and had threatened him for breaking a contract. The dispute was eventually resolved through the intercession of Triad-linked actor Jimmy Wang Yu, and Chan resumed his Hong Kong career in 1982.

In the hopes of better acclimatizing Chan to an American film audience, Weintraub surrounded him with a wholly-American cast, including established actors like José Ferrer and Mako, Playboy Playmate Kristine DeBell, and &quot;The Godfather&quot; actor Lenny Montana. This backfired, as Chan&#x27;s lack of English fluency and American cultural norms meant he struggled to find chemistry with his co-stars. Chan likewise did not have his usual stunt team present, meaning he had less control over the stunts and action scenes that he was accustomed to.

In an interview with Chan on the region 2 DVD, Chan discusses the differences between Chinese and American styles of action. In his early US films, &quot;The Big Brawl&quot; and &quot;The Protector&quot; (1985), Chan had to perform the typical American fight sequences involving punches, kicks and doing few takes, all the way to the end of the action scene. It was not until &quot;Rumble in the Bronx&quot; (1995) that Chan was allowed to use more of his preferred action style in a North American setting, in which he works together with his stunt team and co-stars. It was also then that he was able to do as many takes as he needed in order to capture the sequences adequately.

In &quot;I Am Jackie Chan&quot;, Chan relates one scene in the production in which Robert Clouse was not interested in Chan&#x27;s idea, which was to flip out of a car. Clouse wanted Chan to simply walk from the car to his father&#x27;s restaurant. Chan responded, &quot;No one will pay money to see Jackie Chan walk!&quot;, and felt that the lack of freedom to choreograph sequences the way he wanted underlined the reason for the film&#x27;s failure.

The climactic fight scene was filmed in Floresville, Texas and featured 1,200 extras.

==Reception==
&quot;The Big Brawl&quot; opened on August 29, 1980, on 231 screens in the United States and Canada. In its opening weekend, it grossed US$1,108,025 ($4,792 per screen). By October 1980 (upon its release in England), the film had grossed in the United States, making it a commercial success there. It sold US tickets and ranked among the year&#x27;s top 40 highest-grossing films in North America, with its US gross equivalent to adjusted for inflation in 2018. However, it was ultimately a disappointment to distributor Warner Bros., who were expecting an &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; sized hit.

In Hong Kong, the film grossed HK$5,776,530 (). This made it the year&#x27;s second top-grossing film at the Hong Kong box office, and was higher than &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; which had grossed in Hong Kong. However, the film&#x27;s performance in Hong Kong was considered a disappointment to Golden Harvest.

The film had more success in other international markets. In Taiwan, it grossed (US$212,587) from 296,931 admissions, becoming the second top-grossing film of 1980. In South Korea, it was also the second top-grossing film of 1980 (behind Jackie Chan&#x27;s &quot;The Young Master&quot;), with 233,674 admissions in Seoul, equivalent to an estimated (). In Japan, it grossed ().

In France, where the film released as &quot;Le Chinois&quot; on February 18, 1981, it was the 24th-highest-grossing film of 1981 with 1,510,009 admissions, equivalent to an estimated (US$4,688,376). In Germany, where it released on March 1, 1981, it was the 43rd-highest-grossing film of 1981 with 174,967 box office admissions, equivalent to an estimated (US$479,574). In Spain, the film sold 486,489 tickets, equivalent to an estimated ().

Combined, the film&#x27;s total estimated worldwide box office gross was approximately . In terms of box office admissions, the film sold a combined tickets in the United States, Taiwan, Seoul, France, Germany, and Spain.

=== Critical reception ===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 67% based on reviews from six critics. &quot;Variety&quot; magazine gave it a generally favorable review at the time, calling it &quot;an amusing chopsocky actioner whose appeal is not limited to the usual audience for this genre.&quot;

In retrospective interviews, Chan was critical of the film, considering a stifling and unfulfilling experience.

<doc id="665947" wikidata="Q825745" url="?curid=665947" title="Exit poll">
<text>An election exit poll is a poll of voters taken immediately after they have exited the polling stations. A similar poll conducted before actual voters have voted is called an entrance poll. Pollsters – usually private companies working for newspapers or broadcasters – conduct exit polls to gain an early indication as to how an election has turned out, as in many elections the actual result may take many hours to count.

==History==
There are different views on who invented the exit poll. Marcel van Dam, Dutch sociologist and former politician, says he was the inventor, by being the first to implement one during the Dutch legislative elections on 15 February 1967. Other sources say Warren Mitofsky, an American pollster, was the first. For CBS News, he devised an exit poll in the Kentucky gubernatorial election in November that same year. Notwithstanding this, the mention of the first exit polls date back to the 1940s when such a poll was held in Denver, Colorado.

==Purpose==

Exit polls are also used to collect demographic data about voters and to find out why they voted as they did. Since actual votes are cast anonymously, polling is the only way of collecting this information.

Exit polls have historically and throughout the world been used as a check against, and rough indicator of, the degree of election fraud. Some examples of this include the 2004 Venezuelan recall referendum, and the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election.

They are used to command a mandate as well as to determine whether or not a particular political campaign was successful or not.

==Methods==

The distribution of votes is not even across different polling stations and also varies at different times of day. As a result, a single exit poll may give an imperfect picture of the national vote. Instead, some exit polls calculate swing and turnout. Pollsters return to the same polling stations at the same times at each election, and by comparing the results with previous exit polls they can calculate how the distribution of votes has changed in that constituency. This swing is then applied to other similar constituencies, allowing an estimate of how national voting patterns have changed. The polling locations are chosen to cover the entire gamut of society and where possible, to include especially critical marginal seats. Data is presented in one of three ways, either as a table, graph or written interpretation.

The US exit polls have long been conducted by Edison Research for the National Election Pool of media organizations, interviewing a sample of voters as they leave a polling place. These pollsters choose precincts whose mix of voters is representative of the broader area. These voters may not be typical. For example, minority voters in a mixed precinct may vote at different rates and for different candidates than minority voters in a mostly minority precinct. The Associated Press since 2018 has switched to phone polling, which does not need to be grouped by precinct. They start calling a random sample of voters until they vote, to cover mailed ballots, early voting, and election-day voting.

==Problems==
Like all opinion polls, exit polls by nature do include a margin of error. A famous example of exit poll error occurred in the 1992 UK General Election when two exit polls predicted a hung parliament. The actual vote revealed that Conservative Party government under John Major held their position, though with a significantly reduced majority. Investigations into this failure identified a number of causes including differential response rates (the Shy Tory Factor), the use of inadequate demographic data and poor choice of sampling points.

Another example of this was the 2024 Indian general election, in which after the voting ended, exit polls showed that the incumbent Bharatiya Janata Party–NDA government of Narendra Modi would win 350 to 370 seats in the Parliament of India and thus a landslide, but the actual results showed the opposition&#x27;s strong performance and led to the BJP failing to gain a majority on its own.

As exit polls require a baseline to compare swing against, they are not reliable for one-off votes such as the Scottish independence referendum or the UK EU membership referendum. Because exit polls can&#x27;t reach people who voted by postal ballot or another form of absentee voting, they may be biased towards certain demographics and miss swings that only occur among absentee voters. For example, in the May round of the 2016 Austrian presidential election, exit polls correctly pointed to a narrow lead for Norbert Hofer among those who voted at a polling station. However, the postal votes (which made up about 12% of the total vote) were slightly but definitively in favour of his rival Alexander Van der Bellen, and ultimately gave Van der Bellen victory. This could be considered a non-U.S. example of the phenomenon known as &quot;blue shift&quot; in the U.S.

==Organizations that conduct election exit polling==
In the United States, the National Election Pool (NEP), conducts a joint election exit poll. As of 2018, the NEP members are ABC, CBS, CNN, and NBC (formerly also included AP and Fox News). Since 2004 this exit poll has been conducted for the NEP by Edison Media Research. Edison uses probability-based sampling. In 2020, in-person interviews on Election Day were conducted at a random sample of 115 polling locations nationwide among 7,774 Election Day voters. The results also include 4,919 telephone interviews with early and absentee voters.

The release of exit poll data in the United States is controlled. During the 2012 elections, protocols to quarantine the release of data were put in place.

In Egypt, the Egyptian Center for Public Opinion Research conducted two exit polls in 2014 for the constitutional referendum and presidential election.

In South Korea, exit polls have been conducted by Kantar Public for KBS, SBS, and MBC.

In India, exit polls are conducted by private news broadcasting channels and newspaper agencies such as The Times Group, CVoter, India Today, etc. India being the largest democracy in the world has many agencies publishing exit polls which roughly predict the outcome of the elections.

In Singapore, where exit polls are banned due to privacy issues, a variant of the exit poll, dubbed sample counts, are used instead and have been implemented in every election since 2015.

==Criticism and controversy==
Widespread criticism of exit polling has occurred in cases, especially in the United States, where exit poll results have appeared and/or have provided a basis for projecting winners before all real polls have closed, thereby possibly influencing election results. States have tried and failed to restrict exit polling; however, it is protected by the First Amendment. In the 1980 US presidential election, NBC predicted a victory for Ronald Reagan at 8:15 pm EST, based on exit polls of 20,000 voters. It was 5:15 pm on the West Coast, and the polls were still open. There was speculation that voters stayed away after hearing the results. Thereafter, television networks have voluntarily adopted the policy of not projecting any victor within a state until all polls have closed for that state. In the 2000 US presidential election it was alleged that media organizations released exit poll results for Florida before the polls closed in the Republican-leaning counties of the panhandle, as part of the westernmost area of the state is one hour behind the main peninsula. A study by economist John Lott found an &quot;unusual&quot; decline in Panhandle voter turnout compared to previous elections, and that the networks&#x27; early call of Florida for Democrat Al Gore may have depressed Republican turnout in other states where the polls remained open.

Some countries, including the United Kingdom, Italy, France, Germany, India and Singapore, have made it a criminal offence to release exit poll figures before all polling stations have closed.

In some instances, problems with exit polls have encouraged polling groups to pool data in hopes of increased accuracy. This proved successful during the 2005 UK general election, when the BBC and ITV merged their data to show an exit poll giving Labour a majority of 66 seats, which turned out to be the exact figure. This method was also successful in the 2007 Australian federal election, where the collaboration of Sky News, Seven Network and Auspoll provided an almost exact 53 per cent two party-preferred victory to Labor over the ruling Coalition.

There was a widespread controversy during the 2014 Indian general election when the Election Commission of India barred media organisations from displaying exit poll results until the votes had been counted. This was followed by a strong protest from the media which caused the Election Commission to withdraw its statement and confirm that the exit polls could be shown at 6:30 PM on 12 May after the last vote was cast. Since then exit polls have been prohibited in India while the polls are open, only post-poll opinion surveys are allowed.

<doc id="665948" wikidata="Q2349659" url="?curid=665948" title="Collaborative learning">
<text>Collaborative learning is a situation in which two or more people learn or attempt to learn something together. Unlike individual learning, people engaged in collaborative learning capitalize on one another&#x27;s resources and skills (asking one another for information, evaluating one another&#x27;s ideas, monitoring one another&#x27;s work, etc.). More specifically, collaborative learning is based on the model that knowledge can be created within a population where members actively interact by sharing experiences and take on asymmetric roles. Put differently, collaborative learning refers to methodologies and environments in which learners engage in a common task where each individual depends on and is accountable to each other. These include both face-to-face conversations and computer discussions (online forums, chat rooms, etc.). Methods for examining collaborative learning processes include conversation analysis and statistical discourse analysis.

Thus, collaborative learning is commonly illustrated when groups of students work together to search for understanding, meaning, or solutions or to create an artifact or product of their learning. Furthermore, collaborative learning redefines the traditional student-teacher relationship in the classroom which results in controversy over whether this paradigm is more beneficial than harmful. Collaborative learning activities can include collaborative writing, group projects, joint problem solving, debates, study teams, and other activities. The approach is closely related to cooperative learning.

== Theoretical background ==
Collaborative learning is rooted in Lev Vygotsky&#x27;s concept of learning called zone of proximal development. Typically there are tasks that learners can and cannot accomplish. Between these two areas is the zone of proximal development, which is a category of things that a learner can learn but with the help of guidance. The zone of proximal development gives guidance as to what set of skills a learner has that are in the process of maturation. In Vygotsky&#x27;s definition of zone of proximal development, he highlighted the importance of learning through communication and interactions with others rather than just through independent work. This has made way for the ideas of group learning, one of which being collaborative learning.

Collaborative learning is very important in achieving critical thinking. According to Gokhale (1995), individuals are able to achieve higher levels of learning and retain more information when they work in a group rather than individually, this applies to both the facilitators of knowledge, the instructors, and the receivers of knowledge, the students. For example, Indigenous communities of the Americas illustrate that collaborative learning occurs because individual participation in learning occurs on a horizontal plane where children and adults are equal.

== Differences from cooperative learning ==
There has been a split regarding the differences between collaborative and cooperative learning. Some believe that collaborative learning is similar to, yet distinct from, cooperative learning. While both models use a division of labor, collaborative learning requires the mutual engagement of all participants and a coordinated effort to solve the problem whereas cooperative learning requires individuals to take responsibility for a specific section and then coordinate their respective parts together. Another proposed differentiation is that cooperative learning is typically used for children because it is used to understand the foundations of knowledge while collaborative learning applies to college and university students because it is used to teach non-foundations of learning. Another believed difference is that collaborative learning is a philosophy of interaction whereas cooperative learning is a structure of interaction.

However, many psychologists have defined cooperative learning and collaborative learning similarly. Both are group learning mechanisms for learners to obtain a set of skills or knowledge. Some notable psychologists that use this definition for both collaborative and cooperative learning are Johnson &amp; Johnson, Slavin, Cooper and more.

==Classroom==
Often, collaborative learning is used as an umbrella term for a variety of approaches in education that involve joint intellectual effort by students or students and teachers by engaging individuals in interdependent learning activities. Many have found this to be beneficial in helping students learn effectively and efficiently than if the students were to learn independently. Some positive results from collaborative learning activities are students are able to learn more material by engaging with one another and making sure everyone understands, students retain more information from thoughtful discussion, and students have a more positive attitude about learning and each other by working together.

Encouraging collaborative learning may also help improve the learning environment in higher education. Kenneth Bruffee performed a theoretical analysis on the state of higher education in America. Bruffee aimed to redefine collaborative learning in academia. Simply including more interdependent activities will help the students become more engaged and thoughtful learners, but teaching them that obtaining knowledge is a communal activity itself.

When compared to more traditional methods where students non-interactively receive information from a teacher, cooperative, problem-based learning demonstrated improvement of student engagement and retention of classroom material. Additionally, academic achievement and student retention within classrooms are increased. A meta-analysis comparing small-group work to individual work in K-12 and college classrooms also found that students working in small groups achieved significantly more than students working individually, and optimal groups for learning tended to be three- to four-member teams with lower-ability students working best in mixed groups and medium-ability students doing best in homogeneous groups. For higher-ability students, group ability levels made no difference. 
In more than 40 studies of elementary, middle, and high school English classrooms, discussion-based practices improved comprehension of the text and critical-thinking skills for students across ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Even discussions lasting as briefly as ten minutes with three participants improved perceived understanding of key story events and characters. Improvement in students&#x27; understanding of course content has also been observed at universities.

== Workplace ==
The popularity of collaborative learning in the workplace has increased over the last decade. With the emergence of many new collaborative tools, as well as the cost benefit of being able to reinforce learning in workers and in trainees during collaborative training, many work environments are now looking toward methods that involve collaborating with older employees and giving trainees more of a hands-on approach. Most companies are transitioning from traditional training programs that include instructor-led training sessions or online guided tutorials. Collaborative learning is extremely helpful because it uses past experiences from prior employees to help new trainees get over different challenges.

There are many facets to collaboration in the workplace. It is critical to helping workers share information with each other and creating strategic planning documents that require multiple inputs. It also allows for forms of vertical integration to find effective ways to synchronize business operations with vendors without being forced to acquire additional businesses.

Many businesses still work on the traditional instructor and trainee model and as they transition from one model to another there are many issues that still need to be debugged in the conversation process:
*Need to understand actual interests and concerns regarding collaborating processes, activities and tools
*Reigning leaders and managers must better understand the collaborative tools and processes that can boost productivity
*Become better equipped to design, implement and evaluate collaborative learning environment

Web technologies have been accelerating learner-centered personalized learning environments. This helps knowledge be constructed and shared, instead of just passed down by authorities and passively consumed or ignored. Technologies such as discussion threads, email or electronic bulletin boards by sharing personal knowledge and ideas do not let others refine individual ideas so we need more collaborative tools. Now these tools on Web 2.0 have been able to enhance collaborative learning like no other because it allows individuals to work together to generate, discuss and evaluate evolving ideas. These tools allow for them to find people that are like minded and collaborate with them effortlessly.

According to a collaborative learning study conducted by Lee &amp; Bonk (2014), there are still many issues that are still being resolved when dealing with collaborative learning in a workplace. The goal was to examine corporate personnel, including learning managers and instructors, plus the tools that they use for collaboration. The researchers conducted an online survey to see what aspects of collaborative learning should be investigated, followed by an open discussion forum with 30 corporate personnel. The results showed that collaboration is becoming very necessary in workplaces and tools such as wikis are very commonly used. There is implication for a lot of future work, in order to have collaborative learning be highly effective in the workplace. Some of the unsolved problems they identified:
# Cultural diversity, and accordingly a lack of awareness of cultural norms
# Geographical distance and time zone differences
# Member isolation in virtual teams
# Generation gaps and age differences in the acceptance of collaboration tools
# Lack of technology support for learners
# Lack of learners&#x27; awareness about effective collaboration processes and strategies
# Lack of learners&#x27; technological skills and knowledge about collaboration tools 
It is crucial to consider the interactive processes among people, but the most critical point is the construction of new knowledge brought about through joint work.

== Technology ==
Technology has become an important factor in collaborative learning. Over the past ten years, the Internet has allowed for a shared space for groups to communicate. Virtual environments have been critical to allowing people to communicate long-distances but still feel like they are part of the group. Research has been conducted on how technology has helped increase the potential of collaborative learning.One study in particular conducted by Elizabeth Stacey looked at how technology affected the communication of postgraduate students studying a Master of Business Administration (MBA) using computer-mediated communication (CMC). Many of these students were able to still remotely learn even when they were not present on their university campus. The results of the study helped build an online learning environment model but since this research was conducted the Internet has grown extensively and thus new software is changing these means of communication.

There has been a development of new technology that support collaborative learning in higher education and the workplace. These tools allow for a strong more power and engaging learning environment. Chickering identified seven principles for good practice in undergraduate education developed by Chickering. Two of these principles are especially important in developing technology for collaboration.
# &quot;Good practice develops reciprocity and cooperation among students,&quot;
# Good practice uses active learning techniques.
Some examples of how technology is being increasingly integrated with technology are as follows:

Collaborative networked learning: according to Findley (1987) &quot;Collaborative Networked Learning (CNL) is that learning which occurs via electronic dialogue between self-directed co-learners and learners and experts. Learners share a common purpose, depend upon each other and are accountable to each other for their success. CNL occurs in interactive groups in which participants actively communicate and negotiate learning with one another within a contextual framework which may be facilitated by an online coach, mentor or group leader.

Computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) is a relatively new educational paradigm within collaborative learning which uses technology in a learning environment to help mediate and support group interactions in a collaborative learning context. CSCL systems use technology to control and monitor interactions, to regulate tasks, rules, and roles, and to mediate the acquisition of new knowledge.

Collaborative learning using Wikipedia: Wikipedia is an example of how collaborative learning tools have been extremely beneficial in both the classroom and workplace setting. They are able to change based on how groups think and are able to form into a coherent idea based on the needs of the Wikipedia user.

Collaborative learning in virtual worlds by their nature provide an excellent opportunity for collaborative learning. At first learning in virtual worlds was restricted to classroom meetings and lectures, similar to their counterparts in real life. Now collaborative learning is evolving as companies starting to take advantage of unique features offered by virtual world spaces - such as ability to record and map the flow of ideas, use 3D models, and virtual worlds mind mapping tools.

==Cultural variations==
There also exists cultural variations in ways of collaborative learning. Research in this area has mainly focused on children in indigenous Mayan communities of the Americas or in San Pedro, Guatemala and European American middle-class communities.

Generally, researchers have found that children in indigenous Mayan communities such as San Pedro typically learn through keenly observing and actively contributing to the mature activities of their community. This type of learning is characterized by the learner&#x27;s collaborative participation through multi-modal communication verbal and non-verbal and observations. They are highly engaged within their community through focused observation. Mayan parents believe that children learn best by observing and so an attentive child is seen as one who is trying to learn. It has also been found that these children are extremely competent and independent in self-maintenance at an early age and tend to receive little pressure from their parents.

Research has found that even when Indigenous Mayan children are in a classroom setting, the cultural orientation of indigenous learners shows that observation is a preferred strategy of learning. Thus children and adults in a classroom setting adopt cultural practice and organize learning collaboratively. This is in contrast to the European-American classroom model, which allocates control to teachers/adults allowing them to control classroom activities.

Within the European American middle-class communities, children typically do not learn through collaborative learning methods. In the classroom, these children generally learn by engaging in initiation-reply-evaluation sequences. This sequence starts with the teacher initiating an exchange, usually by asking a question. The student then replies, with the teacher evaluating the student&#x27;s answer. This way of learning fits with European-American middle-class cultural goals of autonomy and independence that are dominant in parenting styles within European-American middle-class culture.

===Examples from Indigenous communities in the Americas===

Although learning happens in a variety of ways in indigenous communities, collaborative learning is one of the main methods used in indigenous learning styles instead of using European-American approaches to learning. These methods include learning in a horizontal plane where children and adults equally contribute to ideas and activities.

For example, Mayan people of San Pedro use collaboration in order to build upon one another&#x27;s ideas and activities. Specifically, many learning practices focus on &quot;role-switching.&quot; When learning a new task, people alternate between helpful observer and active participant. Mayan mothers do not act as teachers when completing a task with their children, but instead collaborate with children through play and other activities. People of this Mayan community use the shared endeavors method more than European-Americans who tend to use the transmit-and-test model more often. The shared endeavors model is when people go off of others ideas and learn from them, while the transmit-and-test model is what is used in most American schools when a teacher gives students information and then tests the students on the information. The shared endeavors model is a form of collaborative learning because everyone learns from one another and are able to hear and share others&#x27; ideas.

In Nocutzepo, Mexico, indigenous heritage families form collective units where it is generally agreed that children and youth engage in adult cooperative household or community economic practices such as food preparation, child care, participating in markets, agriculture, animal herding, and construction to name a few. During planting and harvesting season, entire families are out in the fields together where children usually pitch into the activity with smaller tasks alongside adults; however, are always observant when it comes to activities done by adults, such as driving a tractor or handling an axe. These children learn through imitation, observation, listening, pitching in, and doing activities in a social and cultural context. When children begin to participate in the daily family/community activities, they form a sense of belonging, especially when they collaborate with adults establishing a more mature integration with their family and community. 
Indigenous people of the Americas utilize collaborative learning through their emphasis on role sharing and responsibility sharing within their communities. The Mayan community of San Pedro, Guatemala utilizes flexible leadership that allows children to have an active role in their learning. Children and adults work as cohesive groups when tackling new projects. Collaborative learning is prevalent in Indigenous communities due to the integration of children in the daily lives of the adults. Age is not a determining factor in whether or not individuals are incorporated into collaborative efforts and learning that occurs in indigenous communities.

Participation of learner is a key component to collaborative learning as it functions as the method by which the learning process occurs. Thus collaborative learning occurs when children and adults in communities switch between &quot;knowledge performers&quot; and &quot;observing helpers&quot;. For example, when parents in an indigenous Mazahua community where assigned the task of organizing children to build a roof over a market stand in such a way that they would learn to do it themselves, parents and children both collaborated on a horizontal structure. Switching between knowledge performer and observing helper, adults and children completed the task peacefully, without assigned roles of educator/student and illustrated that children still took initiative even when adults were still performing.

Adults and children in indigenous communities of the Americas participate in a horizontal organizational structure; therefore when they work together with one another they are reciprocals of each other. This horizontal structure allows for flexible leadership, which is one of the key aspects of collaborative learning. The indigenous communities of the Americas are unique in their collaborative learning because they do not discriminate upon age, instead Indigenous communities of the Americas encourage active participation and flexible leadership roles, regardless of age. Children and adults regularly interchange their roles within their community, which contributes to the fluidity of the learning process. In addition, Indigenous communities consider observation to be a part of the collaborative learning process.

Collaborative learning can also be incorporated into university settings. For example, the Intercultural Maya University of Quintana Roo, Mexico, has a system that incorporates elders, such as grandparents to act as tutors and as a resource for students to discuss information and knowledge regarding their own language and culture. The elders give their recommendation at the end of a semester in the decision of passing or failing a student, based on his/her behavior in the community and how well he/she is learning Maya. The system is called IKNAL, a mayan word that implies companionship in the learning and doing process that involves several members of the community.

=== Examples from around the world ===
Collaborative learning varies across the world. The traditional model for learning is instructor based but that model is quickly changing on a global standpoint as countries fight to be at the top of the economy. A country&#x27;s history, culture, religious beliefs and politics are all aspects of their national identity and these characteristics influence on citizen&#x27;s view of collaboration in both a classroom and workplace setting.

==== Japan ====

While the empirical research in Japan is still relatively sparse, many language educators have taken advantage of Japan&#x27;s natural collectivism and experimented with collaborative learning programs More recently, technological advancements and their high adoption rate among students in Japan have made computer supported collaborative learning accessible. Japanese student&#x27;s value for friendship and their natural inclination towards reciprocity seems to support collaborative learning in Japan.

==Examples==
* Collaborative learning development enables developers of learning systems to work as a network. Specifically relevant to e-learning where developers can share and build knowledge into courses in a collaborative environment at a quick pace and typically lower cost. Knowledge of a single subject can be pulled together from remote locations using software systems.
* Collaborative learning in thesis circles in higher education is another example of people learning together. In a thesis circle, a number of students work together with at least one professor or lecturer, to collaboratively coach and supervise individual work on final (e.g. undergraduate or MSc) projects. Students switch frequently between their role as co-supervisor of other students and their own thesis work (incl. receiving feedback from other students).
* Collaborative learning in a composition classroom can unite students when assigned open-tasks. Kenneth Bruffee introduced the learning method, Classroom Consensus Group, in which the instructor allocates groups of three to five (three being ideal) students and assigns a problem to be solved or question to be answered. There are two directions the nonfoundational task can be presented: as an indistinct, no right answer that generates discussion or propose an answer and request questions and a process of how the answer came to be. Once the task is assigned, the instructor backs off in order to resist the urge to intervene in students&#x27; conversation. The goal is to remove focus of the instructor&#x27;s authority. The instructor must keep time to ensure the students are centered on analogizing, generalizing, and bridging their comprehension with others. Following group discussion, the instructor is to evaluate, not judge, the students&#x27; work. Ideas should be presented to the entire class thus allowing the small groups to come together as a whole. It is then that the answers can be compared, gaps can be filled, and authority is not on one individual.
* Collaborative scripts structure collaborative learning by creating roles and mediating interactions while allowing for flexibility in dialogue and activities. Collaborative scripts are used in nearly all cases of collaborative learning some of which are more suited for face-to-face collaborative learning—usually, more flexible—and others for computer-supported collaborative learning—typically, more constraining. Additionally, there are two broad types of scripts: macro-scripts and micro-scripts. Macro-scripts aim at creating situations within which desired interactions will occur. Micro-scripts emphasize activities of individual learners.
Collaborative learning is also employed in the business and government sectors. For example, within the federal government of the United States, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is employing a collaborative project management approach that focuses on collaborating, learning and adapting (CLA). CLA involves three concepts:
* Adapting strategically based on applied learning.
* Collaborating intentionally with stakeholders to share knowledge and reduce duplication of effort,
* Learning systematically by drawing on evidence from a variety of sources and taking time to reflect on implementation.

<doc id="665951" wikidata="Q1064349" url="?curid=665951" title="Deterministic algorithm">
<text>In computer science, a deterministic algorithm is an algorithm that, given a particular input, will always produce the same output, with the underlying machine always passing through the same sequence of states. Deterministic algorithms are by far the most studied and familiar kind of algorithm, as well as one of the most practical, since they can be run on real machines efficiently.

Formally, a deterministic algorithm computes a mathematical function; a function has a unique value for any input in its domain, and the algorithm is a process that produces this particular value as output.

== Formal definition ==

Deterministic algorithms can be defined in terms of a state machine: a &quot;state&quot; describes what a machine is doing at a particular instant in time. State machines pass in a discrete manner from one state to another. Just after we enter the input, the machine is in its &quot;initial state&quot; or &quot;start state&quot;. If the machine is deterministic, this means that from this point onwards, its current state determines what its next state will be; its course through the set of states is predetermined. Note that a machine can be deterministic and still never stop or finish, and therefore fail to deliver a result.

Examples of particular abstract machines which are deterministic include the deterministic Turing machine and deterministic finite automaton.

== Non-deterministic algorithms ==

A variety of factors can cause an algorithm to behave in a way which is not deterministic, or non-deterministic:
* If it uses an external state other than the input, such as user input, a global variable, a hardware timer value, a random value, or stored disk data.
* If it operates in a way that is timing-sensitive, for example, if it has multiple processors writing to the same data at the same time. In this case, the precise order in which each processor writes its data will affect the result.
* If a hardware error causes its state to change in an unexpected way.

Although real programs are rarely purely deterministic, it is easier for humans as well as other programs to reason about programs that are. For this reason, most programming languages and especially functional programming languages make an effort to prevent the above events from happening except under controlled conditions.

The prevalence of multi-core processors has resulted in a surge of interest in determinism in parallel programming and challenges of non-determinism have been well documented. A number of tools to help deal with the challenges have been proposed to deal with deadlocks and race conditions.

== Disadvantages of determinism ==

It is advantageous, in some cases, for a program to exhibit nondeterministic behavior. The behavior of a card shuffling program used in a game of blackjack, for example, should not be predictable by players — even if the source code of the program is visible. The use of a pseudorandom number generator is often not sufficient to ensure that players are unable to predict the outcome of a shuffle. A clever gambler might guess precisely the numbers the generator will choose and so determine the entire contents of the deck ahead of time, allowing him to cheat; for example, the Software Security Group at Reliable Software Technologies was able to do this for an implementation of Texas Hold &#x27;em Poker that is distributed by ASF Software, Inc, allowing them to consistently predict the outcome of hands ahead of time. These problems can be avoided, in part, through the use of a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator, but it is still necessary for an unpredictable random seed to be used to initialize the generator. For this purpose, a source of nondeterminism is required, such as that provided by a hardware random number generator.

Note that a negative answer to the P=NP problem would not imply that programs with nondeterministic output are theoretically more powerful than those with deterministic output. The complexity class NP (complexity) can be defined without any reference to nondeterminism using the verifier-based definition.

== Determinism categories in languages ==

=== Mercury ===
The mercury logic-functional programming language establishes different determinism categories for predicate modes as explained in the reference.

=== Haskell ===
Haskell provides several mechanisms:
* Non-determinism or notion of Fail
** the &quot;Maybe&quot; and &quot;Either&quot; types include the notion of success in the result.
** the &quot;fail&quot; method of the class Monad, may be used to signal &quot;fail&quot; as exception.
** the Maybe monad and MaybeT monad transformer provide for failed computations (stop the computation sequence and return Nothing)
* Neterminism/non-det with multiple solutions
** you may retrieve all possible outcomes of a multiple result computation, by wrapping its result type in a MonadPlus monad. (its method &quot;mzero&quot; makes an outcome fail and &quot;mplus&quot; collects the successful results).

=== ML family and derived languages ===

As seen in Standard ML, OCaml and Scala
* The &quot;option&quot; type includes the notion of success.

=== Java ===
In Java, the &quot;null&quot; reference value may represent an unsuccessful (out-of-domain) result.

<doc id="665953" wikidata="Q5115567" url="?curid=665953" title="Chuck Klein">
<text>Charles Herbert Klein (October 7, 1904 – March 28, 1958), nicknamed &quot;the Hoosier Hammer&quot; because of his Indiana roots, was an American professional baseball outfielder. Klein played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies (–, –, –), Chicago Cubs (–), and Pittsburgh Pirates ().

Klein led the National League (NL) in home runs four times, and won the NL Most Valuable Player Award in 1932. In 1933 he became one of six (at the time) NL players to win a batting Triple Crown. In 1930 he set the NL record for extra-base hits with 107. On July 10, 1936, he hit four home runs in a game, becoming the fourth player to do so. He was the first player to be selected to the All-Star Game as a member of two different teams (Phillies and Cubs). Klein was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1980.

==Early life==
Klein was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, on October 7, 1904, the son of immigrant farmers Frank and Margaret Klein. After finishing high school at Southport High School, he began working at a steel mill instead of attending college due to his poor grades at school. As a result, Klein’s talents were not noticed by the major league clubs until his early 20s. He was picked up by a semi-pro team and played for them for a few years earning $200 a week (). The St. Louis Cardinals noticed his talent and signed him to a minor-league contract. Within a year, he worked his way up to the Cardinals&#x27; farm team in Fort Wayne, which played in the Class B Central League (roughly equivalent to today&#x27;s Double-A).

After hitting 26 homers in 88 games in 1928, Klein was slated to be called up to St. Louis midway through the season. However, Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis discovered that the Cardinals owned a team in Dayton, Ohio, that also played in the Central League with Fort Wayne. Landis ordered the Cardinals to sell off the Fort Wayne team and give up the rights to its players. The Phillies purchased Klein&#x27;s contract for a sum of $5,000 () and in the process outbid the New York Yankees for Klein&#x27;s services. Klein joined the Phillies in July.

==MLB career==
===Peak years===
Klein hit .356 in 1929, his first full season, and won the NL home run title. In the middle of the season, the Phillies added a 15-foot screen on top of the short right-field wall of Baker Bowl. The timing was peculiar as Klein was coming off of a torrid July where he hit 14 home runs, and was making a run at the home run record. However, William Baker, the Phillies&#x27; notoriously miserly owner, defended the addition of the screen, stating, &quot;a number of accidents happen[ing] on Broad street owing to the balls going over the fence and hitting pedestrians, also damaging automobiles, breaking windshields, etc.&quot; For the remainder of the season, due to the new height of the right field wall, Klein only hit 4 home runs in the 25 games he played at Baker Bowl after August 1st. In those 25 home games however, he hit 12 doubles. On the last day of the season, the Phillies played a doubleheader against the New York Giants. The Giants&#x27; star slugger, Mel Ott, was tied with Klein for the lead with 42. In the first game, Klein homered to put him one ahead of Ott, who was held to a single. In the second game, the Phillies&#x27; pitchers walked Ott five straight times, including once with the bases loaded. Early in the 1930 season before their season debut with the Giants, New York press acknowledged that Klein&#x27;s home run record was tainted, because of what happened with Ott in the last game the previous season. &quot;He calls me the pop fly home run champ.&quot; Klein said in referring to Ott. &quot;Say, I can hit a ball farther with one hand than that little runt can with two. Bring on those Giants. I&#x27;ll eat them up!&quot;

In 1930, Klein enjoyed one of the best offensive years in baseball history, batting .386 with 250 hits and 158 runs scored, all career highs. He also set career bests and still-standing Phillies records with 59 doubles, 170 runs batted in (RBI), a .687 slugging percentage and 445 total bases. No player has had as many total bases in a season since. His 107 extra-base hits that year are a National League record, tied by Barry Bonds in 2001. Along with his batting prowess, Klein was also a good defensive right fielder; he is tenth on the all-time list for assists for a right fielder. 1930 marked the second straight season where Klein had collected at least 200 hits, along with his hitting records he set the single season mark for assists by a right fielder with 44. This is due to the height that was added to the right field wall in 1929 which caused more balls to fall in right field. On July 1, 1931, in a game against the Chicago Cubs, Klein hit for the cycle, going 4-for-5 with five RBI. At the end of the season, he led the National League in runs scored with 121 and RBI with 121. He also led the league in home runs for the second time in his career with 31, and amassed at least 200 hits for the third season in a row.
After the 1932 season, Klein was awarded the National League MVP award. During the season, he led the league in home runs for the third time, as well as hits and runs scored, he also became the first player in the live-ball era to lead the league in both home runs and stolen bases. No player since has led the league in both categories in the same year. He finished the season with 226 hits, marking the fourth year in a row that he exceeded the 200 hit mark. On May 26, 1933, the Phillies lost a 14 inning game to the St. Louis Cardinals, during this game Klein hit for the cycle for the second time in his career. On July 6, 1933, he became the first Phillies player ever to bat in an All-Star Game after receiving a majority of the fans’ votes. At the end of the season, he became the fourth NL player since 1901 to win the Triple Crown with a batting average of .368, and led the NL in home runs with 28 and RBI with 120. At the end of the season, due in part to Carl Hubbell&#x27;s brilliant pitching season, and the Giants winning the 1933 World Series, Klein finished second in MVP voting behind Hubbell. 
===Later career===
On November 21, 1933 Klein was traded to the Cubs for $65,000 () and three other players, Klein hit 20 and 21 home runs in his two full seasons with the Cubs (1934, 1935) and batted .301 and .293 in those seasons respectively. As good as those numbers were, they were nowhere near what Klein had posted in Philadelphia, leading to claims that he would not have hit nearly as many homers had he not played in notoriously hitter-friendly Baker Bowl. The Phillies reacquired him on May 21, 1936. On July 10, 1936, in the spacious Forbes Field, against the 42-34 Pirates, Klein became the first NL player to hit four home runs in a game in the 20th century, and only the 4th player in major league history to accomplish the feat. His fourth home run that game was a leadoff home run in the top of the tenth inning, the Phillies scored 2 more runs to win the game 9-6 after ten innings.

Klein went to the Pirates during the 1939 season, but was back in Philadelphia in 1940 for what proved to be his last year as a regular player. From 1941 onward, he never played in more than 50 games in a season, and was often used as a pinch hitter. In his last eight seasons, from 1937 to 1944, he averaged 69 games played, batted .253 and hit 43 home runs. He retired midway through the 1944 season after getting one hit in seven at-bats.

==Later life==
After retiring, he owned and operated a bar in Kensington, Philadelphia, until 1947. He endured some difficult financial times, largely due to a drinking problem. He would later suffer a stroke which left one leg paralyzed. By 1947, Klein was living with his brother, and his wife in Indianapolis, Indiana. He died there in 1958.

==Legacy==
In his 17-year major league career, Klein played in 1,753 games, batted .320, with 1,201 RBI, 1,168 runs, 2,076 hits, 398 doubles, 74 triples, 300 home runs, .379 on-base percentage, .543 slugging percentage, and an OPS of .922. Klein was known for exploiting the Phillies home park, the Baker Bowl, and its short right field wall. In his career he hit for a .395 average and slugged 164 home runs in only 581 career games at the Baker Bowl. Klein recorded five five-hit games, 36 four-hit games in his career and 28 multi-home run games.

After never receiving more than 28% on the ballot, a campaign was started to get Klein elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame via the Veterans Committee. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1980 via the Veterans Committee. Richard Nixon listed Klein on his all-time baseball team. In 1999, he ranked number 92 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.

As with another Philadelphia legend from the pre-numbers era of baseball, Grover Cleveland Alexander, the Phillies simply honored Klein with his name and an Old English-style &quot;P&quot; where a retired uniform number would go on the outfield wall of Veterans Stadium. The Phillies began using numbers in 1932, and in that season and 1933, Klein wore number 3. He was then traded to the Chicago Cubs, and when he returned to the Phillies in 1936, he wore 32 (later retired by the Phillies for Steve Carlton), and soon switched to 36 (later retired by the Phillies for Robin Roberts) for that season and 1937. In 1938, he wore number 1 (later retired by the Phillies for Richie Ashburn), wore 26 and then 14 (later retired by the Phillies for Jim Bunning) in 1939, wore 29 in 1940 and 1941, 3 again in 1942, 8 in 1943 and 26 again in 1944, his last major league season.

<doc id="665954" wikidata="Q1627108" url="?curid=665954" title="Mavericks, California">
<text>Mavericks is a surfing location in northern California outside Pillar Point Harbor, just north of the town of Half Moon Bay at the village of Princeton-by-the-Sea. After a strong winter storm in the northern Pacific Ocean, waves can routinely crest at over and top out at over . The break is caused by an unusually shaped underwater rock formation.

Mavericks is a winter destination for some of the world&#x27;s best big wave surfers. From 1999 to 2016, an invitation-only contest called the Titans of Mavericks was held there during most winter surfing seasons, whenever the winter wave conditions there were deemed to be suitable to meet the needs of the contest.

==Origin of the name==

In early March 1967, Alex Matienzo, Jim Thompson, and Dick Notmeyer surfed the distant waves of Pillar Point. With them was Matienzo&#x27;s roommate&#x27;s white-haired German Shepherd, Maverick, who was accustomed to swimming with his owner and Matienzo while they were surfing. The three surfers left Maverick on shore, but he swam out to them. Finding the conditions unsafe for the dog, Matienzo tied him up before rejoining the others. The riders had limited success that day as they surfed overhead peaks about from shore, just along the rocks that are visible from shore; they deemed the bigger outside waves too dangerous. The surfers named the location after Maverick, who seemed to have gotten the most pleasure from the experience.

==Description==
===Sea floor===
Sea-floor maps released by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in 2007 revealed the mechanisms behind Mavericks&#x27; waves. A long, sloping ramp leads to the surface. The ramp slows the propagation of the wave over it. The wave over the deep troughs on each side of the ramp continues at full speed forming two angles in the wavefront centered over the boundaries between the ramp and the troughs. The result of this is a U-shaped or V-shaped wavefront on the ramp that contains the wave energy from the full width of the ramp. This U-shaped or V-shaped wave then collapses into a small area at the top center of the ramp with tremendous force.

===Left Hander===
The left at Mavericks is rarely ridden, as the wave tends to be unreliable. It can be a much faster ride than the right, shooting riders down a quicker pipe barrel. Surfline says the left is &quot;a short-lived explosion of hell and spitfire.&quot;

==History==

Jeff Clark grew up in Half Moon Bay, watching Mavericks from Half Moon Bay High School and Pillar Point. At that time the location was thought too dangerous to surf. He conceived the possibility of riding Hawaii-sized waves in Northern California. In 1975 at age 17 and with the waves topping out at , Clark paddled out alone to face the break. He caught multiple left-breaking waves, thereby becoming the first documented person to tackle Mavericks head-on.

Other than a few of Clark&#x27;s friends who had paddled out and had seen Mavericks for themselves, no big wave surfers believed in its existence. Popular opinion held that there simply were no large waves in California.

Dave Schmidt (brother of big wave legend Richard Schmidt) and Tom Powers, both from Santa Cruz, were two of the next people to surf at Mavericks, surfing with Clark on January 22, 1990. John Raymond, from Pacifica, Johathan Galili, from Tel Aviv, Israel, and Mark Renneker, from San Francisco, surfed Mavericks a few days later.

===Popularization===
In 1990, a photo of Mavericks taken by Clark&#x27;s friend Steve Tadin was published in &quot;Surfer&quot; magazine, generating interest in Mavericks. More photos of Mavericks appeared in surfing magazines, and before long, filmmaker Gary Medeiros released a movie, &quot;Waves of Adventure in the Red Triangle&quot;. As news of Mavericks spread, many big-wave surfers came and surfed there.

===Death of Mark Foo===
On December 23, 1994, during a week of huge swells, notable Hawaiian big-wave riders Mark Foo, Ken Bradshaw, Brock Little, Mike Parsons, and Evan Slater visited Mavericks. In the late morning, Foo rode on a late takeoff into an wave, caught the edge of his surfboard on the surface, and fell forward into a wipe out near the bottom of the wave. A few hours later, a fellow surfer traveling back to shore on a boat noticed a body in the water, which was identified as Foo. The only visible injury was a small cut on the forehead. Many surfers believe that the fall knocked the wind out of Foo and he was tied down by his leash to a rock formation.

The accident afforded Mavericks greater notoriety and prompted the formation of the &quot;Mavericks Water Patrol&quot; by Frank Quirarte and Clark. The accident also triggered a continuing discourse around the safe use of surfboard leashes while surfing extreme waves. Many believed that Foo&#x27;s surfboard leash may have contributed to his death. Leash proponents defend it as a useful convenience and as insurance against losing the surfboard, a form of flotation device, a means for a fallen surfer to find the surface by following the leash cord to the buoyant board. Opponents argue that a leash can cause the rider to collide with their board in a wipe out and that the leash can also loop around the surfer&#x27;s arms, legs or the neck when underwater. Quick-release velcro leashes have since become standard surfing equipment to address some of these risks.

===Death of Sion Milosky===
Sion Milosky, an accomplished big-wave surfer, died at Mavericks on March 16, 2011. Milosky, 35, of Kalaheo, Kauai, Hawaii, apparently drowned after enduring a two-wave hold down around 6:30 PM. Twenty minutes after the incident, Nathan Fletcher found Milosky&#x27;s body floating at the Pillar Point Harbor mouth.

Milosky had been named the North Shore Underground Surfer of the Year in February 2011. He used some of his $25,000 prize to travel to Half Moon Bay to catch one of the last big swells of the season at Mavericks.

=== Women at Mavericks ===
In 1999, Sarah Gerhardt became the first woman to surf Mavericks. In 2018, after a long fight, women were first included in the formal Titans of Mavericks surf competition, also receiving equal prize money.

=== World Records ===
In 2001, Carlos Burle won the Billabong XXL Big Wave Award by riding a tall wave at Mavericks.

On 23 December 2024, Alessandro &quot;Alo&quot; Slebir rode an estimated tall wave at Mavericks, which would exceed the current world record by over 20 feet. The wave height was estimated by the Mavericks Rescue Team, but has not yet been confirmed by Guinness World Records.

==Invitational Surfing Contest==

The first surfing contest at Mavericks was held in 1999, as the &quot;Mavericks Invitational.&quot; The competition later came to be known as the Titans of Mavericks invitational. Organizers would invite a number big wave surfers annually to compete in the one-day event, but it was only held if wave conditions were favorable during the competition season (which season ran from November 1-March 31). In 2019, after two years of cancelled competitions, the World Surf League announced that the contest had been canceled indefinitely, citing &quot;various logistical challenges&quot; and &quot;the inability to run the event the last two seasons.&quot; The competition has not been held since.

The Mavericks Awards is, as of 2022 a new video performance contest where big wave surfers and videographers submit their best surf content of Mavericks each season. There are 3 categories for men and 3 categories for women include Biggest Wave, Ride of the Year, and Performer of the Year.

The first videos were shot by Eric W. Nelson in February 1990, catching Clark, Schmidt and Powers. Eric was shooting for his community access television show &quot;Powerlines Surf-Spots&quot;. This was the origin of the Powerlines Productions company that showcases big wave surfing around the world.

Nelson&#x27;s first film was &quot;High Noon at Low Tide&quot; 1994/1995. In 1998, he produced another big wave documentary &quot;Twenty Feet Under&quot;. Local filmmaker Curt Myers, produced &quot;Shifting Peaks&quot; and &quot;Heavy Water&quot; 1994/1995.

On December 11, 1998, they combined their efforts and produced the mini-documentary &quot;twelveleven&quot;.

Clark and Mavericks are featured in the 1998 documentary &quot;Mavericks&quot;, a one-hour PBS film that chronicles the early years, and the 2004 film &quot;Riding Giants&quot;, which documents the history of big wave surfing. Directed by skateboarder turned documentary producer Stacy Peralta (best known for the skating documentary &quot;Dogtown and Z-Boys&quot;), &quot;Riding Giants&quot; includes interviews and commentary materials with many of the surfers mentioned in this article.

In the film &quot;Zoolander&quot;, Owen Wilson&#x27;s entourage includes a big wave surfer from Mavericks.

The surfing documentary film &quot;Discovering Mavericks&quot;, executive produced by Jeff Clark and directed by Joshua Pomer, features surfers like Jeff Clark, Peter Mel, Flea, Shane Dorian, Nick Lamb, Zack Wormhoudt, Brock Little and Mike Parsons, and also honors Mark Foo and Jay Moriarty.

&quot;Chasing Mavericks&quot;, a 2012 biopic about Mavericks surfer Jay Moriarity, starred Gerard Butler as Frosty Hesson, Abigail Spencer as Brenda Hesson, Frosty&#x27;s wife. Jonny Weston as Jay Moriarity, Elisabeth Shue as Christy Moriarity and Leven Rambin as Kim Moriarity. Maya Rains plays Roque Hesson, while Patrick and Asher Tesler (twins) portray Lake, son of Frosty and Brenda. Moriarty&#x27;s spectacular wipeout in 1994 had landed the 16-year-old surfer in the pages of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and on the cover of &quot;Surfer&quot; magazine. On December 19, 2011, film star Butler survived a near-death accident, pounded by waves. Butler was held underwater for several waves and dragged through rocks until rescued by a safety worker on a jet ski. According to eyeforfilm.co.uk, &quot;Butler was knocked off his board by a freak wave. He was trapped underwater as two more waves went over him, and witnesses say he took the force of four or five waves to the head. He was also dragged through rocks before rescuers managed to reach him and get him to the shore. Butler was conscious when pulled from the water and spent the next sixteen hours in Stanford Medical Center.&quot;

A memoir, &quot;Making Mavericks&quot; by Frosty Hesson with Ian Spiegelman, was released by Zola Books in October 2012. The book recounts Hesson&#x27;s time as one of the first to conquer the massive break at Mavericks and his mentoring of Moriarity.

On June 10, 2013, at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple announced that the latest version of its Mac operating system OS X (version 10.9) would be entitled Mavericks. Apple said their new operating software generations would be named after places in California that have inspired them.

<text>In computer science and computer programming, a nondeterministic algorithm is an algorithm that, even for the same input, can exhibit different behaviors on different runs, as opposed to a deterministic algorithm.

Different models of computation give rise to different reasons that an algorithm may be non-deterministic, and different ways to evaluate its performance or correctness:
*A concurrent algorithm can perform differently on different runs due to a race condition. This can happen even with a single-threaded algorithm when it interacts with resources external to it. In general, such an algorithm is considered to perform correctly only when &quot;all&quot; possible runs produce the desired results.
*A probabilistic algorithm&#x27;s behavior depends on a random number generator called by the algorithm. These are subdivided into Las Vegas algorithms, for which (like concurrent algorithms) all runs must produce correct output, and Monte Carlo algorithms which are allowed to fail or produce incorrect results with low probability. The performance of such an algorithm is often measured probabilistically, for instance using an analysis of its expected time.
*In computational complexity theory, nondeterminism is often modeled using an explicit mechanism for making a nondeterministic choice, such as in a nondeterministic Turing machine. For these models, a nondeterministic algorithm is considered to perform correctly when, for each input, &quot;there exists&quot; a run that produces the desired result, even when other runs produce incorrect results. This existential power makes nondeterministic algorithms of this sort more efficient than known deterministic algorithms for many problems. The P versus NP problem encapsulates this conjectured greater efficiency available to nondeterministic algorithms. Algorithms of this sort are used to define complexity classes based on nondeterministic time and nondeterministic space complexity. They may be simulated using nondeterministic programming, a method for specifying nondeterministic algorithms and searching for the choices that lead to a correct run, often using a backtracking search.

The notion of nondeterminism was introduced by Robert W. Floyd in 1967.

<doc id="665961" wikidata="Q7094549" url="?curid=665961" title="Onside kick">
<text>In gridiron football, an onside kick is a kickoff (under American and Canadian rules) or punt (under Canadian rules only) deliberately kicked short in an attempt by the kicking team to regain possession of the ball. This is in contrast with a typical kickoff or punt, in which the kicking team kicks the ball far downfield in order to maximize the distance the receiving team has to advance the ball in order to score. The risk to the team attempting an onside kick is that if it is unsuccessful the receiving team gets the ball and usually has a much better field position than with a normal kick.

The onside kick has a low success rate, though its chances of success increase in a situation where the returning team does not expect it. In American football, it is generally only seen late in a game when a team has just scored but is still trailing by 8 points or fewer (the most points that can be scored on a single possession) and needs to regain possession in order to score again before time expires.

== General rules ==

Gridiron football originates in rugby football and so does the onside kick. In rugby, while the forward pass is prohibited, a team in possession may legally kick the ball downfield and recapture possession, provided that the receiver of the kick was onside when the kick was made (&quot;i.e.&quot;, abreast with or behind the kicker.)

This form of onside kick is still legal in Canadian football, just as in rugby. A player of the kicking team (for any kick, not just a free kick) who is &quot;onside&quot; may recover the ball and retain possession for his team. This includes the kicker himself and anyone else behind the ball at the time it was kicked, other than the holder for a place kick.

The form of onside kick available at a free kick in American football is also available in Canadian football for a kickoff as well, although it is referred to as a short-kick, as all players are onside for a kickoff; however, the kick may well be chipped high instead of bounced, because the players of the receiving team have no particular first right to the ball as in American football (due to the fair catch rule); both sides may play the ball equally, even in the air.

In 2024 NFL rules, onside kicks are only allowed in the fourth quarter of games and if the team doing it is losing. The losing team additionally must declare it is attempting the onside kick, thus eliminating the surprise factor prior to the rule change.

== Modern American football usage ==
Starting in 1923, the following additional constraints in most forms of American football are relevant to the onside kick:
* The kick must be a free kick (a kickoff, or free kick after a safety; in high school football, but not the NFL, the rare fair catch kick can also be recovered onside).
* The kick must cross the receiving team&#x27;s restraining line (normally 10 yards in front of the kicking team&#x27;s line), unless the receiving team touches the ball before that line.
* The kicking team may only recover and retain possession of the kicked ball, but not advance it.
* The kicking team must not interfere with an attempt by a player of the receiving side to catch the ball on the fly.
Unlike during a punt—when if the kicking team catches or recovers the ball, it is &quot;downed&quot; and the receiving team possesses the ball—during a free kick, a ball that has crossed the receiving team&#x27;s restraining line is normally a live ball, such that if the kicking team catches or recovers the ball it retains possession. &quot;Onside&quot; is therefore now a misnomer in American football; an onside kick is simply any free kick that is kicked in a particular way to give the kicking team the best chance of regaining possession—typically in a diagonal direction and as close to the advancing players from the kicking team as possible.

The kicking team generally attempts to make the ball bounce early (to remove the possibility of being charged with interfering with a catch) and be available around 20 yards in front of the spot of the kick. One technique, useful especially on a hard or artificial surface, is to kick the ball in such a way that it spins end-over-end near the ground and makes a sudden bounce high in the air. The oblong shape of an American football makes it bounce unpredictably, increasing the possibility that the receiving team will muff the catch. An alternative is to kick the ball with great force directly at an opposing player. If the ball touches the player, but he cannot secure it, it becomes live regardless of whether it has traveled 10 yards.

When the receiving team expects an onside kick, it often fields a &quot;hands team&quot; of players skilled at catching or otherwise securing the ball. This is so they can make sure of securing possession once the ball has traveled the necessary 10 yards—the receiving team cannot simply refuse to touch the ball, as the ball is live once it has traveled 10 yards and can be claimed by either team; thus, if the receiving team does not make a play on the ball, it makes it far easier for the kicking team to do so and regain possession.

Traditionally, the onside kick had its own formation, in which the other ten players of the kicking team would line up on one side (left or right) of the kicker, in an effort to get as many people as possible into one area of the field. This is still popular in high school football; however, the NCAA (and later the NFL) now require that at least four players line up on each side of the kicker. To combat this, some teams (including the Buffalo Bills, who pioneered this strategy) developed a &quot;cluster formation&quot; in which all of the players line up behind and immediately next to the kicker in what is effectively a moving huddle. The NFL eventually banned this, too, with a 2009 rule change that states that &quot;the kicking team cannot have more than five players bunched together&quot;; the rule change has been considered a gratuitous targeting of Bills special teams coach Bobby April, as the ostensible reason for the ban (injury risk) had negligible evidence to support it. Effective with the 2018 season, the NFL requires that the kicking team line up with five players on each side of the ball. Additionally, the kicking team&#x27;s players must line up in a specified configuration—on each side of the ball, at least two players must be between the sideline and the numbered yard markings, and at least two must line up between the numbers and hashmarks. At the same time, the NFL also required that at least eight members of the receiving team line up within the 15-yard &quot;setup zone&quot; (between 10 and 25 yards from the kickoff spot).

In 2018, the NFL also mandated that no member of the kicking team, apart from the kicker, could line up more than one yard from the spot of the kickoff. Previously, all members of the kicking team could line up as many as five yards from the kickoff spot, allowing that team to make a running start toward an onside kick.
An onside kick is usually a desperation technique used when the kicking team trails in the game with little time left, in order to regain the ball and score again. The trade-off is that, in the usual case where the receiving team does get possession of the ball, it will have better field position and will need to advance the ball fewer yards in order to score. However, in the desperation situation, initial field position becomes less relevant, as the receiving team may focus on running the clock out and ending the game. If the kicking team succeeds in retaining possession, then the clock does not automatically stop as it would if the ball were transferred between teams (though it may stop for other reasons).

Occasionally, football coaches attempt surprise onside kicks to catch their opponent&#x27;s players off guard and without the &quot;hands team&quot; on the field. Notable examples from championship games include Super Bowl XXX, when Pittsburgh Steelers coach Bill Cowher called an onside kick early in the fourth quarter when trailing 20–10, which was successfully recovered, and Super Bowl XLIV, where the New Orleans Saints executed an onside kickoff to start the second half and successfully converted the possession into a touchdown. In the 2016 College Football Playoff National Championship, with the score tied at 24–24 in the middle of the fourth quarter, the Alabama Crimson Tide successfully executed an onside kick against the Clemson Tigers, which led to a touchdown that gave Alabama the lead and eventual victory.

An onside kick is considered successful if the kicking team regains the ball. Between 2001 and 2010, surprise onside kicks were successful 60% of the time, while expected onside kicks were successful less than 20% of the time. Another study of just the 2005 and 2006 seasons also found similar disparities depending on whether the defense expects an onside kick. Accordingly, some analysts have suggested that the surprise onside kick is underutilized. In 2014, the Indianapolis Colts routinely used the onside kick, with three in the first six games of the season, often at the start of the game. Each of these was successful.

Overall, the success rate of the onside kick has dropped considerably since these rule changes. In the 2018 NFL season, only 4 of 52 onside kicks () were successful, a figure that had dropped to (two of 32) through the first eleven weeks of .

Furthermore, for the 2024 season, the NFL adopted a new kickoff procedure that banned surprise onside kicks. Teams are now required to announce any onside kick attempts to officials before the play, and these may only be attempted by the losing team in the 4th quarter.

== Offside &quot;onside&quot; kicks ==
There have been versions of American football in which the kicking team could recover the ball once it hit the ground, regardless of onside or offside, and not only for free kicks. Any such kick recovered by the kicking team is often referred to as an &quot;onside kick,&quot; even if the recovering player was in front of the kicker at the time of the kick (and thus, according to the original definition, offside).

One such scenario remains legal at all levels: any player on the offensive team can recover a kick anywhere on or behind the line of scrimmage.

===College football===
These were also referred to as &quot;onside kicks from scrimmage.&quot; Vanderbilt coach Dan McGugin was a prime innovator in this field, and in fact in 1921 tied Georgia for the Southern crown on such a play.

Saint Louis University coach Eddie Cochems described the play after the 1906 season:

::&quot;Instead of keeping the ball in the air it should be kicked to the ground as soon as the case will permit, since the moment it touches, the whole team is on-side. The longer the kicker can delay kicking the further down the field the team can get to either recover the ball themselves or form interference for the player who is supposed to recover.&quot;

In these early years and into the 1920s, all players of the kicking team except the kicker were permitted to recover the ball once it hit the ground beyond the neutral zone. Later, the rules were modified to require it be at least 20 yards downfield, before recovering one&#x27;s own kick was eventually eliminated outright.

===Professional football===
One such version, Arena football, is current; however, it must be taken from either a place kick or drop kick, because punts are illegal in that league. Arena football also has the advantage in that it features rebound nets surrounding the goal posts; thus, unlike in the outdoor game, a potential onside kick receiver does not have to outrun the speed of the kicked ball, and the kicker can carom the ball off the net in hopes of it landing in his teammate&#x27;s arms.

The XFL, in its 2001 season, allowed a punting team to recover its own kick if the punt went at least 25 yards past the line of scrimmage. The 2020 revival of the XFL did not revive this rule.

The idea of the early 20th century, XFL, and Arena rules allowing kicking side recovery on grounded balls was generally to force the receiving team to play the ball, encourage surprise quick kicking, and thereby loosen the defense. However, kicks have rarely been employed as offensive tactics even when these rules were present; the forward pass remains the more effective (and substantially less risky) tactic to loosen and surprise the defense.

== Alternatives to onside kicks ==
The Alliance of American Football, which played a partial season in 2019, eliminated all kickoffs, including onside kicks. The AAF&#x27;s substitute for onside kicks was an &quot;onside conversion&quot;, essentially an attempt to convert a 4th-and-12. This was allowed in only two situations:
* Five minutes or less remained in the fourth quarter, or
* The team attempting the conversion was trailing by at least 17 points.
After scoring a touchdown, a team could opt to try an onside conversion from its own 28-yard line. After giving up a safety, a team could opt to try an onside conversion from its own 18-yard line. In both cases, the team had to gain at least 12 yards on that play to maintain possession. Otherwise, the opponent gained possession at the final spot of the play.

The Denver Broncos proposed adding a slightly modified version of the AAF&#x27;s onside conversion rule to the NFL rules for the 2019 NFL season. The Broncos&#x27; proposal would make the attempt a 4th-and-15 from the attempting team&#x27;s 35-yard line. Additionally, this proposal would have allowed each team to run this play only once per game, and only in the fourth quarter. When first proposed, the NFL&#x27;s competition committee voted 7–1 in favor of the change, but it failed to receive the required two-thirds majority approval from the league owners at their March 2019 meeting. The proposed rule change was revisited at the next NFL owners&#x27; meeting in 2020 but was not approved.

For the 2020 Pro Bowl, the NFL announced a special onside conversion rule, essentially using the Broncos&#x27; proposal above, except the 4th-and-15 is attempted from the team&#x27;s own 25-yard line.

Fan Controlled Football, which has no kicking, offers the onside conversion; teams must gain 10 yards from their own 10-yard line.

The 2022 version of the USFL has kickoffs, but also offers the onside conversion, with teams required to gain 12 yards from their own 33-yard line.

==Rugby==
Most kick-offs in rugby union are similar to the onside kick: the kick-off is directed a minimum of ten metres forward and both teams attempt to recover the ball. In both codes of rugby during live play, the bomb or &quot;up and under&quot; involves kicking the ball forward with a very high trajectory then the kicker and other on-side players rushing forward in an attempt to recover the ball.

<text>The Chicago Wolves are a professional ice hockey team in the American Hockey League (AHL) and are affiliated with the Carolina Hurricanes of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Wolves play home games at the Allstate Arena in the Chicago suburb of Rosemont, Illinois, and are owned by Chicago business owner Don Levin.

Originally a member of the International Hockey League, the Wolves joined the AHL after the IHL folded in 2001.

==History==
The Wolves won the Turner Cup twice (1998, 2000) in the IHL and the Calder Cup three times (2002, 2008, and 2022). The Wolves qualified for all but five postseasons (2005–06, 2008–09, 2010–11, 2012–13, and 2015–16 seasons), appearing in eight league championship finals (1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2005, 2008, 2019 and 2022) in their 22-year history.

The team&#x27;s most notable player was forward Steve Maltais, who until his retirement after the 2004–05 season had played every season of the franchise and holds most of its scoring records. Other notable players include goaltender Wendell Young, ex-Pittsburgh star Rob Brown and long time Chicago Blackhawks stars Troy Murray, Chris Chelios and Al Secord. The Wolves had their best season start in their 14-year history, during the 2007–08 season, winning 13 of the first 14 games, with an overtime loss. The Wolves finished the season with 111 points, and first in the Western Conference.

The Wolves were the AHL affiliate of the Atlanta Thrashers from 2001 to 2011. The Thrashers relocated to Winnipeg in June 2011 and added the St. John&#x27;s IceCaps (formerly the Manitoba Moose) as their new AHL affiliate, leaving the Wolves and the NHL&#x27;s Vancouver Canucks to find new affiliates. On June 27, 2011, the Wolves and Canucks agreed to a two–year affiliation agreement.

On April 23, 2013, the Wolves and St. Louis Blues reached a three-year affiliation agreement. The deal was struck after the Canucks and Wolves decided not to renew their existing affiliation agreement and purchased the Peoria Rivermen franchise from the Blues creating the Utica Comets. In November 2016, it was first reported the Blues would not renew their affiliation with the Wolves and were planning to move their affiliation to Kansas City for 2017. However, this was unconfirmed and then denied by the announced potential owner in Kansas City, Lamar Hunt Jr., in a press release from his ECHL team in the area, the Missouri Mavericks, and further denied by AHL commissioner, David Andrews, after the January 2017 Board of Governors meeting.

After the 2016–17 season, the Wolves became the first affiliate of the NHL&#x27;s expansion team, the Vegas Golden Knights. The Blues did not re-sign with the Wolves to be their primary NHL affiliate for the 2017–18 season. However, Blues&#x27; general manager Doug Armstrong confirmed they would still send prospects to the Wolves for that season.
During the first season of their affiliation with Vegas, the Wolves set a pair of franchise records in earning points in 14 straight games from December 9 to January 6 and 13 consecutive home wins from December 6 to February 15. In the 2018–19 season, the Wolves made the Calder Cup Finals, in which they lost to the Charlotte Checkers in five games. During the 2019–20 season, the Golden Knights stated it was looking to own and operate its own AHL team in the Las Vegas region in 2020–21, but it would not be the Wolves. The Golden Knights agreed to purchase the San Antonio Rampage franchise and move it to the Las Vegas area as the Henderson Silver Knights. On September 10, 2020, the Wolves announced an affiliation agreement with the Carolina Hurricanes. In addition, the Wolves added a temporary secondary NHL affiliate in the Nashville Predators for the 2020–21 season as the Predators&#x27; affiliate, the Milwaukee Admirals, opted out of the COVID-19 pandemic-shortened season. For the 2020–21 season, the teams&#x27; home games were at their training facility at the Triphahn Center in Hoffman Estates due to arena restrictions for fans during the pandemic.

During the 2023–24 season, the Wolves played as independent AHL team, becoming the first independent AHL team since the 1994–95 season. On May 2, 2024, the team renewed its affiliation with the Carolina Hurricanes for a three-year term beginning with the 2024–25 season.

==Television==
The Wolves once were the only AHL team with a full television package. As the Chicago Blackhawks&#x27; late owner Bill Wirtz had refused to allow Blackhawks home games to be televised locally, the Wolves were viewed and embraced as an alternative; the Wolves took advantage of this, going so far as to promote themselves with the slogan &quot;We Play Hockey The Old-Fashioned Way: We Actually &quot;Win&quot;&quot;. After Judd Sirott served as the team&#x27;s play-by-play announcer for its first 12 seasons, starting in the 2006–07 season broadcast announcers were long-time Blackhawks commentators Pat Foley and Bill Gardner; Foley ultimately returned to the Blackhawks for the 2008–09 season after Bill Wirtz died and his son Rocky took over the team, reversing many of his father&#x27;s policies, one of which allowed the Blackhawks&#x27; games to be aired locally on TV. Since 2008, Jason Shaver has handled the play-by-play duties for the Wolves, along with Gardner.

Today, select regular-season home games are broadcast on WPWR-TV (My50), and WMEU-CD (The U), and all games are streamed on AHLTV.

<doc id="665967" wikidata="Q681193" url="?curid=665967" title="Meiringen–Innertkirchen railway line">
<text>The Meiringen–Innertkirchen railway line is a railway line in the Swiss canton of Bern. It covers a distance of between Innertkirchen and Meiringen, where it connects with the Brünig railway line of the Zentralbahn company, which links Interlaken and Lucerne.

The Kraftwerke Oberhasli (KWO) electricity supply company built the line in 1926 to support the development of the local hydroelectricity industry. It began carrying passengers in 1946 and the KWO spun off a new company, the Meiringen-Innertkirchen-Bahn (MIB), to operate it. KWO sold the company to the Zentralbahn at the end of 2020. The line serves a local transport role, as well as transporting tourists to the scenic Aare Gorge.

==History==
The line was originally built as a construction railway to support the building of hydroelectric dams in the Oberhasli and the Grimsel Pass. It was built by the Kraftwerke Oberhasli (KWO) company, which was founded to build and operate the hydroelectric plants, and it was opened in 1926. Several Mallet-type steam locomotives were acquired from the Rhätische Bahn to operate the line. As well as construction traffic, the line also operated a limited passenger service for workers and their families. In 1931 a battery railcar was purchased, and a second in 1939.

In 1940, a military installation was constructed in caverns, which connected to the Kirchetunnel that by-passes the Aare Gorge, as well as to the gorge itself. A train parked in the tunnel provided offices and other facilities for this installation. The caverns and connecting tunnels still exist, but are no longer used.

In 1946 the line received a licence to operate as a public passenger-carrying railway, and to this end the Meiringen-Innertkirchen-Bahn company was founded to operate the line as a subsidiary of the owners, KWO.

When the license came up for renewal in 1976, it was decided to upgrade the line drastically. The heavy, four-wheel battery railcars were harsh on the track and trackbed, and were at the end of their economic life. The line was electrified and electric streetcar-type railcars were purchased. In 1996, a new railcar was purchased to run most services. In 2005, a second-hand railcar was purchased to act as reserve, allowing the former streetcars to be scrapped.

In 2003, the underground Aareschlucht Ost stop was opened, to provide access to the eastern entrance to the Aare Gorge.

On January 1, 2021, the Zentralbahn took over the line.

==Operation==
===Route===
The line begins at track 13 of Meiringen railway station, where it is physically connected to the Brünig line of the Zentralbahn company. Both lines are of gauge, but are incompatible electrically, and no through passenger services are operated. Shortly after leaving the station, the line crosses a level crossing and passes the disused former passenger terminus of the line, used until passenger service was extended into the main station.

The first stop on the line is at Alpbach. This is some walk from the lower station of the Reichenbachfall Funicular, which takes visitors up to the famous Reichenbach Falls, the site of the apparent death of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s fictional hero, Sherlock Holmes. For many years, Alpbach was the point at with the MIB made a level crossing with the Meiringen–Reichenbach–Aareschlucht line, a tramway that existed from 1912 to 1956.

From Alpbach the line follows the north bank of the Aare river. The next stop is Aareschlucht West, just before the beginning of the scenic Aare Gorge or Aareschlucht. The line by-passes the gorge through the long Kirchetunnel, which contains the underground Aareschlucht Ost stop. Both Aareschlucht stops link to the tourist walkways through the gorge itself.

After a further intermediate stop at Unterwasser, the line passes through the middle of Innertkirchen village, calling at the Innertkirchen Post stop, before ending at the KWO plant in Innertkirchen. Beyond the passenger terminus, the line continues into the KWO&#x27;s workshops, where the line&#x27;s workshops are also found.

===Services===
Passenger services are operated once or twice per hour, seven days a week, with connections into and out of most trains on the Brunig line. Trains comprise a single railcar.

The operation of the Aareschlucht Ost stop is particularly notable, as the train stops within the tunnel, with its front door adjacent to a door in the side of the tunnel that opens out through the side of the gorge. The tunnel door is opened by the train driver only once the train has come to a halt. The stop is a request stop, and passengers wishing to board a train must press a button outside the tunnel door to request the train to stop.

Freight traffic is run as demand warrants, largely carrying spare parts arriving via the Brünigbahn for the power stations.

<doc id="665986" wikidata="Q772989" url="?curid=665986" title="Parental leave">
<text>Parental leave, or family leave, is an employee benefit available in almost all countries. The term &quot;parental leave&quot; may include maternity, paternity, and adoption leave; or may be used distinctively from &quot;maternity leave&quot; and &quot;paternity leave&quot; to describe separate family leave available to either parent to care for their own children. In some countries and jurisdictions, &quot;family leave&quot; also includes leave provided to care for ill family members. Often, the minimum benefits and eligibility requirements are stipulated by law.

Unpaid parental or family leave is provided when an employer is required to hold an employee&#x27;s job while that employee is taking leave. Paid parental or family leave provides paid time off work to care for or make arrangements for the welfare of a child or dependent family member. The three most common models of funding are government-mandated social insurance/social security (where employees, employers, or taxpayers in general contribute to a specific public fund), employer liability (where the employer must pay the employee for the length of leave), and mixed policies that combine both social security and employer liability.

Parental leave has been available as a legal right or governmental program for many years in one form or another. In 2014, the International Labour Organization reviewed parental leave policies in 185 countries and territories, and found that all countries except Papua New Guinea have laws mandating some form of parental leave. A different study showed that of 186 countries examined, 96% offered some pay to mothers during leave, but only 44% of those countries offered the same for fathers. The Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Tonga, and the United States are the only seven countries in the United Nations that do not require employers to provide paid time off for new parents. Private employers sometimes provide either or both unpaid and paid parental leave outside of or in addition to any legal mandate.

Research has linked paid parental leave to better health outcomes for children, as well as mothers.

== Economic models ==

=== Benefits of universal, paid parental leave ===

==== Capabilities approach ====
Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum have developed a political model known as the capabilities approach, where basic freedoms and opportunities are included in the economic assessments of a country&#x27;s well-being, in addition to the GDP of a country. Nussbaum proposed 11 central capabilities as the minimum requirement for a decent society. In Nussbaum&#x27;s model, states should provide the resources and freedoms to ensure people have the opportunity to achieve a minimum threshold of each central capability. Universal, paid parental leave is an example resource states can provide so people have the option of starting a family while also working; for instance, under capacity 10 (control of one&#x27;s environment), the state has a responsibility to ensure all people have &quot;the right to seek employment on an equal basis with others.&quot;

==== Income and workforce ====
Paid parental leave incentivizes labor market attachment for women both before and after birth, affecting the GDP and national productivity, as the workforce is larger. Parental leave increases income at the household level as well by supporting dual-earner families.

Paid parental leave incentivises childbirth, which affects the future workforce. It is thus argued that paid parental leave, in contrast to unpaid parental leave, is harmful to children&#x27;s welfare because in countries with an aging workforce or countries with sub-replacement fertility, children are born not because the parents want the child and can meet the child&#x27;s needs but because children are expected to support their parents. Some see children as responsible for supporting all those in older generations in the society (not just the child&#x27;s specific parents); their earnings are expected not to be saved for the children&#x27;s own old age, but to be spent on the earlier generations&#x27; demand for social security and pensions for which there was inadequate savings.

=== Challenges to universal, paid leave ===

==== Statistical discrimination ====
The neoclassical model of labor markets predicts that, if the cost of hiring women of child-bearing years is anticipated to increase (either because the employer is mandated to pay for maternity leave or because she will be absent from work on public leave), then the &quot;demand&quot; for women in the labor market will decrease. While gender discrimination is illegal, without some kind of remedy the neoclassical model would predict &quot;statistical discrimination&quot; against hiring women of child-bearing years. To counteract this, some countries have introduced policies to increase rates of paternity leave to spread the cost impact more evenly across the labor market.

==== Occupational sex segregation ====
If women take long parental leaves, the neoclassical model would predict that their lifetime earnings and opportunities for promotion will be less than their male or childfree counterparts—the &quot;motherhood penalty&quot;. Women may seek out employment sectors that are &quot;family-friendly&quot; (i.e., with generous parental leave policies), resulting in occupational sex segregation. Nielsen, Simonsen, and Verner examine what the different outcomes for women in Denmark are between the &quot;family-friendly&quot; and the &quot;non-family-friendly&quot; sector. In Denmark, the public sector is &quot;family-friendly&quot; because of its generous leave and employee benefits; workers decide which sector to work in based on their preferences and opportunities. The study found that, while in the &quot;family-friendly&quot; sector there was basically no wage loss related to taking parental leave, women did have consistent earnings loss in the &quot;non-family-friendly&quot; private sector for one year&#x27;s leave.

==== Cost ====
Universal, paid parental leave can be privately funded (i.e., corporations are mandated to absorb the cost of paid parental time off as part of employee benefits) or publicly funded (i.e., transferred directly to workers on leave, like unemployment insurance). Concerns about private funding include the statistical discrimination described above as well as the costs to smaller businesses. Datta Gupta, Smith, &amp; Verneer found in 2008 that, while publicly funded parental leave has benefits, it is very expensive to fund and question if it is the most cost-effective use of funds.

==== Criticism of the &#x27;father quota&#x27; ====

The father&#x27;s quota is a policy implemented by some countries or companies that reserves a part of the parental leave or other types of family leave for the father. If the father does not take this reserved part of leave, the family loses that leave period—that is, it cannot be transferred to the mother. Given the high rates of women&#x27;s participation in the formal labor force in many parts of the world, there is increasing interest among social scientists and policymakers in supporting a more equal division of labor between partners. Some critics question whether such policies are evidence-based and express concern that they are &quot;a social experiment, the effects of which are unknown&quot;. However, other studies have shown that paternity leave improves bonds between fathers and children and also helps mitigate the wage gap women face after taking maternity leave. Other psychological perspectives summarise evidence and find that the role of a father in child development is very similar to that of a mother, counteracting the concern that greater paternal involvement in childcare could lead to unforeseen negative consequences. Criticism is often less concerned about the idea of paternity leave itself, but condemns the fact that father&#x27;s quota policies do not allow that time to be allocated to the mother instead. Critics argue that the quota harms mothers, depriving them of much needed leave, trivializes biological realities, and is an example of discrimination against mothers.

In the European Union, non-transferable parental leave remains a controversial issue. It was first introduced by the Parental Leave Directive 2010, which required at least one month of the minimum four months of parental leave be non-nontransferable; this non-transferable period was increased to two months by the Work–Life Balance Directive of 2019, which must be transposed by member states at the latest on 2 August 2022. Originally, the plan under the Work–Life Balance Directive was to increase the non-transferable period to four months, but due to inability to reach consensus among member states, a compromise was reached at two months. (note: this refers to the specific type of leave called parental leave, under EU law there are different types of leave, such as maternity leave, paternity leave, parental leave, and carer leave which are regulated differently).

For more, see Paternity leave and its effects.

=== Comparison between countries ===
Comparison between countries in term of employee benefits to leave for parents are often attempted, but these are very difficult to make because of the complexity of types of leave available and because terms such as maternity leave, paternity leave, pre-natal leave, post-natal leave, parental leave, family leave and home-care leave, have different meanings in different jurisdictions. Such terms may often be used incorrectly. Comparing the length of &quot;maternity leave&quot; (which is common in international rankings) may say very little about the situation of a family in a specific country. A country for example may have a long maternity leave but a short (or non-existent) parental or family leave, or vice versa. In the European Union, each country has its own policies, which vary significantly, but all the EU members must abide by the minimum standards of the Pregnant Workers Directive and Work–Life Balance Directive.

Sometimes there is a distortion in how maternity leave is reported and delimitated from other types of leave, especially in jurisdictions where there is no clear legal term of &quot;maternity leave&quot;, and such term is used informally to denote either the minimum or the maximum period of parental leave reserved by quota to the mother. Some countries may be listed artificially as having more or less generous benefits. Sweden is sometimes listed in international statistics as having 480 days&#x27; &quot;maternity leave&quot;, although these days include parental leave. As such, Sweden is often quoted as having an exceptionally long leave, although there are several countries with significantly longer leave, when maternity leave and other leaves are added, where a parent may take leave until a child is 3 years of age.

== Parental leave uptake ==
=== Peer effects ===
Research has demonstrated that the duration of parental leave among individuals is influenced by peer behaviour. For example, if a mother notices a coworker opting for a longer parental leave, the probability of her to also increase their maternity leave increases. Welteke and Worhlich (2019) article found that expectant mother&#x27;s who had peers taking parental leave of longer than ten months were thirty percent more likely to also take more than ten months off compared to expectant parents whose peers took a shorter leave. The influence of peer effects is not solely present to expectant mothers but also fathers. Research in Norway found that expectant fathers were 11 percent more likely to take paternity leave if they witnessed their coworkers use this benefit. In addition to coworkers, expectant fathers were 15 percent more likely to use paternity leave if their brother also utilized the program. Dahl et al., (2014) research additionally found a snowball effect occurring in workplaces where fathers using paternity leave.This means with every additional coworker utilizing benefits of parental leave in the office, the likelihood of others to also use the program benefits.

There are competing arguments to why peers have an influence to the duration of paternal leave of an expecting parent. The first hypothesis stems from mothers learning from their peers about parental leave programs they were previously unaware of. This increase in awareness would lead to more mothers utilizing parental leave for a longer duration. A competing hypothesis states that when coworkers increase their pregnancy leave, there becomes a change in the social norms of that workplace. This phenomenon is known as &quot;herd behaviour&quot; in which an alteration of the traditional habits in the workplace shifted the behaviour of the employees.

=== Uptake of parental leave for fathers ===
Several factors influence the uptake of parental leave by expectant fathers. For example, research has found that fathers who had a secondary education were 28% more likely to take parental leave programs longer than fathers who did not receive secondary education. Furthermore, fathers with a tertiary education were 67% more likely to take parental leave of longer than two months than dads with secondary education.

Additionally, the Income levels of fathers have been noted to influence the uptake of fathers&#x27; parental leave. Low-income fathers are less likely to use parental leave, and if they did take off time, it is shorter in duration compared to fathers with a higher income. The discrepancies between the two demographics may be due to fathers with lower incomes being restricted by personal finances. Fathers in heterosexual relationships are even less likely to take parental leave if the mother is a low earner herself. The mother&#x27;s low income positively correlates with the father taking little to no parental leave. This may be due to the father wanting the mother to take longer leave or other factors; such as the pressure to provide for the household financially.

Research in Sweden found that foreign-born fathers are less likely to partake in parental leave than Swedish-born fathers. The authors have theorized that this result might reflect greater instability of labour markets for first-generation migrants. Additionally, there is a greater likelihood for first-generation immigrants to lack access to information concerning parental leave can contribute to the decrease in uptake from this demographic.

Another aspect that influences the uptake of parental leave is gender dynamics at home and work. In households with a positive association between fatherhood involvement and egalitarian values, the father utilization of parental leave is increased. Workplace environments that promote parental leave for fathers as essential create a greater likelihood of these dads taking parental leave for a longer duration. In contrast, a workplace culture that views paternal leave as an indicator of poor work habits and as &quot;feminine&quot; causes fathers in that environment to be less likely to participate in parental leave. In Australia it has been argued, by Georgie Dent, that the uptake of parental leave by fathers could enable the workforce participation of women, leading to improved economic outcomes for families as well as the country.

=== Eligibility and uptake of parental leave for mothers ===
The eligibility and uptake of parental leave programs are not consistent among all demographics of expecting mothers. In most European countries, parental leave is granted to parents, usually after maternity and paternity leave. In some countries, parental leave has more restrictive requirements than maternity leave or paternity leave. 
Research by Marynissen, Wood and Neels (2021) found that 26.37% of mothers in Belgium are not eligible for parental leave. This is due to the employment-based eligibility criteria present with the country&#x27;s parental leave program (although unemployed women receive maternity leave). By utilizing an employment-based measure, scholars have noted that this creates barriers for currently unemployed mothers to receive an opportunity to take more time off looking for a job and care for their child. Another limitation present with employment-based criteria is that in some countries self-employed individuals are not eligible for certain parental benefits. For example, in Belgium, a self-employed woman receives a maternity leave that is shorter and lower paid than an employed woman; and does not receive parental leave. There are also a certain number of hours an employee must meet before being eligible for employment-based parental leave. These various factors limit access to parental care for expecting mothers. Expecting parents who are the most affected by these criteria are usually younger, single, less educated or from migrant backgrounds.

In addition to discrepancies present in eligibility, there is variation among expecting mothers who utilize parental leave benefits. For example, research performed by Kil, Wood and Neels(2018) found that native-born Belgian women had higher uptake of parental programs (52%) in comparison to first-generation Belgian citizens from Turkey and Morocco, whose uptake was relatively low (34%). The difference in uptake can be attributed to factors such as the flexibility of the parental leave, culture of the workplace, cultural ideals of paid leave, not knowing about the program itself and other normative factors that influenced the utilization of paid leave.

Research has found that mothers in same-sex relationships are less likely to uptake parental leave than mothers in different-sex relationships. Evertsson and Boye (2018) found that birth mothers in same-sex relationships, on average, took seven weeks less parental leave than birth mothers in different-sex relationships. The authors reference that gender norms result in the difference between parental uptake duration between birth mothers in same-sex relationships compared to different-sex relationships.

=== Eligibility of parental leave for same sex couples ===
Eligibility of parental leave for same sex couples depends on numerous factors: on adoption policies (on whether or not same-sex couples can adopt jointly or not; on whether a single parent is allowed to adopt or not - and if yes, whether the second parent can subsequently adopt - and on surrogacy laws). 
According to a study that examined policies in 34 OECD countries, in nineteen of these countries, same sex female couples received the same amount of parental leave benefits as different sex couples. 
For same-sex male couples, four countries provided the same duration of parental leave as different sex couples. Therefore, twenty-nine OECD countries provided a shorter period of parental leave and fewer benefits for same-sex male parents. In addition, some countries, such as Turkey and Israel, provided no parental leave benefits or paid leave for the expectant male parents.

The reason for discrepancies in parental leave between same-sex and different-sex couples is theorized to have several different explanations, usually related to who can be a legal parent. One factor affecting parental leave duration for same-sex couples is the restrictive language found in parental leave policies. The study found that some parental leave policies only referred to heterosexual couples and did not include same-sex couples in the legislation, leading to increased barriers for same-sex parents to receive paid leave. Another significant barrier comes when same-sex couples try adopting their child. In 15 of the 34 OECD countries examined, same sex couples cannot legally adopt a child together. In these countries, same-sex couples may have one person in the relationship adopt their child as a single parent. Only one parent will be provided parental or adoption-related leave through this adoption strategy. While there is an option of second-parent adoption in some of these 15 countries, the process of a second adoption is costly and time-consuming- creating potential barriers that restrict the same-sex couple from pursuing this procedure. In some countries, same-sex parents can only be formed through a birth mother in a lesbian relation (considered legally a single mother), so the second mother does not receive leave.

==International minimum standards==
The Maternity Protection Convention, 2000 requires at least 14 weeks of maternity leave. In the European Union, the Pregnant Workers Directive requires at least 14 weeks of maternity leave; while the Work–Life Balance Directive requires at least 10 days of paternity leave, as well as at least 4 months of parental leave, with 2 months being non-transferable.

== Effects ==
Typically, the effects of parental leave are improvements in prenatal and postnatal care, including a decrease in infant mortality. The effects of parental leave on the labor market include an increase in employment, changes in wages, and fluctuations in the rate of employees returning to work. Leave legislation can also impact fertility rates.

=== On the labor market ===
A study in Germany found that wages decreased by 18 percent for every year an employee spends on parental leave. However, after the initial decrease in wages, the employee&#x27;s salary rebounds faster than the salary of someone not offered parental leave. A study of California&#x27;s leave policy, the first state in the U.S. to require employers to offer paid parental leave, showed that wages did increase.

Parental leave can lead to greater job security. Studies differ in how this helps return to work after taking time off. Some studies show that if a parent is gone for more than a year after the birth of a child, it decreases the possibility that he or she will return. Other studies of shorter leave periods show that parents no longer need to quit their jobs in order to care for their children, so employment return increases.

It does not appear that parental leave policies have had a significant effect on the gender wage gap, which has remained relatively steady since the late 1980s, despite increasing adoption of parental leave policies.

==== Maternity leave and its effects ====

In the U.S., while the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) allows for unpaid parental leave, parents often do not utilize this eligibility to its fullest extent as it is unaffordable. As a result, some studies show that the FMLA has had a limited impact on how much leave new parents take. Though specific amounts can vary, having a child (including the cost of high-quality childcare) costs families approximately $11,000 in the first year. These high costs contribute to new mothers in the United States returning to work quicker than new mothers in European countries; approximately one third of women in the United States return to work within three months of giving birth, compared to approximately five per cent in the U.K., Germany, and Sweden, and just over half of mothers in the United States with a child under the age of one work.

There is some evidence that legislation for parental leave raises the likelihood of women returning to their previous jobs as opposed to finding a new job. This rise is thought to fall to between 10% and 17%. Simultaneously, there is a decrease in the percentage of women who find new jobs, which falls between 6% and 11%. Thus, such legislation appears to increase how many women return to work post-childbirth by around 3% or 4%.

Additionally, it appears that parental leave policies do allow women to stay home longer before returning to work as the probability of returning to an old job falls in the second month after childbirth before dramatically rising in the third month. Although this legislation thus appears to have minimal effect on women choosing to take leave, it does appear to increase the time women take in leave.

Maternity leave legislation could pose benefits or harm to employers. The main potential drawback of mandated leave is its potential to disrupt productive activities by raising rates of employee absenteeism. With mandated leave for a certain period of time and facing prolonged absence of the mothers in the workplace, firms will be faced with two options: hire a temp (which could involve training costs) or function with a missing employee. Alternatively, these policies could be positive for employers who previously did not offer leave because they were worried about attracting employees who were disproportionately likely to use maternity leave. Thus, there is potential for these policies to correct market failures. A drawback of rising leave at the societal level, however, is the resulting decrease in female labor supply. In countries with a high demand for labor, including many present-day countries with aging populations, a smaller labor supply is unfavorable.

Something important to note for all the research cited above is that the results typically depend on how leave coverage is defined, and whether the policies are for unpaid or paid leave. Policies guaranteeing paid leave are considered by some to be dramatically more effective than unpaid-leave policies.

For women individually, long breaks in employment, as would come from parental leave, negatively affects their careers. Longer gaps are associated with reduced lifetime earnings and lower pension disbursements as well as worsened career prospects and reduced earnings. Due to these drawbacks, some countries, notably Norway, have expanded family policy initiatives to increase the father&#x27;s quota and expand childcare in an effort to work towards greater gender equality.

According to a 2016 study, the expansion of government-funded maternity leave in Norway from 18 to 35 weeks led mothers to spend more time at home without a reduction in family income.
==== Paternity leave and its effects ====
The term &#x27;paternity leave&#x27; refers to the leave that is exclusively granted to the fathers to enable them in spending time with their new-born child. Although parental leave is increasingly granted to fathers, mothers continue to take the majority of guaranteed parental leave. When guaranteed leave is unpaid, research indicates that men&#x27;s leave usage is unaffected. In Germany, where parental leave is guaranteed for both parents, the financial incentive, alone, was not enough to encourage fathers to take paternal leave. While uncommon on a world scale, some countries do reserve parts of the paid leave for the father, meaning it can&#x27;t be transferred to the mother and lapses unless he uses it. Among the earliest countries to actively push for increased usage of paternity leave are the Nordic welfare states, starting with Sweden making parental leave gender neutral in 1974 and soon followed by Iceland, Denmark, Norway and Finland. These countries lack a unified concept of paternity leave, each imposing different conditions, ratios and timescales, but are regarded as among the most generous in the world.

Partly in an initiative to combat the &quot;motherhood penalty&quot;, Norway in 1993 initiated a policy change to incentivize paternal leave, the so-called &quot;father&#x27;s quota&quot;, and Sweden followed suit in 1995. This means a certain number of parental leave-days can only be used by the father, and are otherwise lost. In countries in which leave entitlements include a father&#x27;s quota, there has been a pronounced impact, with the quota being credited for increasing paternal involvement and challenging gender roles within the family, promoting a more equal division of labor. To evaluate this change, Rønsen and Kitterød looked at the rate and timing of women&#x27;s return to work after giving birth, and the effect on this of the new parental leave policy. In their 2015 study, Rønsen and Kitterød found women in Norway returned to work significantly faster after the policy change. However, public or subsidized daycare was greatly expanded at the same time, so Rønsen and Kitterød did not find that the &quot;father&#x27;s quota&quot; was solely responsible for the timing of work entry. But it can be understood to have an effect on division of household labor by gender when both parents can take time to care for a new baby.

Another impact from fathers taking more leave is that in Norway it has been shown to have the potential to either decrease or increase the time women take, depending on whether the mother&#x27;s and father&#x27;s childcare are seen as substitutes or complements. If substitute goods, mothers are able to return to work sooner as fathers take some of the childcare responsibility. Research has suggested a class element is at play: middle class fathers consider themselves a suitable alternative to the mother as primary caregiver, while working-class men may see themselves more as supporters of their partner during her leave. Consequently, middle class fathers may be more likely to use their allotment of leave right after the mother returns to work, while working class fathers may opt to take their leave during the mother&#x27;s leave. In some cases, longer leave for fathers can motivate mothers to also stay home.

Fathers tend to use less parental leave than mothers in the United States as well as in other countries where paid leave is available, and this difference may have factors other than the financial constraints which impact both parents. Bygren and Duvander, looking at the use of parental leave by fathers in Sweden, concluded that fathers&#x27; workplace characteristics (including the size of the workplace, whether there were more men or women in the workplace, and whether the workplace was part of the private or public sector) influenced the length of parental leave for fathers, as did the presence of other men who had taken parental leave at an earlier point in time. As of 2016 paternity leave accounts for 25% of paid parental leave in Sweden.

A 2023 study found that paternity leave causes attitudinal change on gender issues. When paternity leave is made available to fathers, parents increasingly support gender-egalitarian socioeconomic policies and women&#x27;s rights issues.

==== Length of leave ====

In 2013, Joseph, Pailhé, Recotillet, and Solaz published a natural experiment evaluating a 2004 policy change in France. They were interested in the economic effects of full-time, short paid parental leave. Before the reform, women had a mandatory two-month parental leave, and could take up to three years&#x27; unpaid parental leave with their job guaranteed, though most women only took the two months. The new policy, &quot;complément libre choix d&#x27;activité&quot; (CLCA), guarantees six months of paid parental leave. The authors found positive effects on employment: compared to women in otherwise similar circumstances before the reform, first-time mothers who took the paid leave after the reform were more likely to be employed after their leave, and less likely to stay out of the labor force. The authors point to similar results of full-time, short paid parental leave observed in Canada in 2008 by Baker and Milligan, and in Germany in 2009 by Kluve and Tamm. However, Joseph also found that wages were lower (relative to women before the reform) for moderately and highly educated women after the leave, which could be because the women returned to work part-time or because of a &quot;motherhood penalty&quot;, where employers discriminate against mothers, taking the six-month leave as a &quot;signal&quot; that the woman will not be as good of an employee because of her mothering responsibilities.

Rasmussen analyzed a similar natural experiment in Denmark with a policy change in 1984 where parental leave increased from 14 to 20 weeks. Rasmussen found the increased length of parental leave had no negative effect on women&#x27;s wages or employment and in the short run (i.e., 12 months) it had a positive effect on women&#x27;s wages, compared to the shorter leave. There was no difference on children&#x27;s long-term educational outcomes before and after the policy change.

=== On health and development ===

According to a 2020 study, parental leave leads to better health outcomes for children. A Harvard report cited research showing paid maternity leave &quot;facilitates breastfeeding and reduces risk of infection&quot; but is not associated with changes in immunization rate. This research also found that countries with parental leave had lower infant mortality rates. Returning to work within 12 weeks was also associated with fewer regular medical checkups. Data from 16 European countries during the period 1969–1994 revealed that the decrease of infant mortality rates varied based on length of leave. A 10-week leave was associated with a 1–2% decrease; a 20-week leave with 2–4%; and 30 weeks with 7–9%. The United States, which does not have a paid parental leave law, ranked 56th in the world in 2014 in terms of infant mortality rates, with 6.17 deaths per every 1,000 children born. The research did not find any infant health benefits in countries with unpaid parental leave. Paid leave, particularly when available prior to childbirth, had a significant effect on birth weight. The frequency of low birth rate decreases under these policies, which likely contributes to the decrease in infant mortality rates as low birth weight is strongly correlated with infant death. However, careful analysis reveals that increased birth weight is not the sole reason for the decreased mortality rate.

A 2021 study found that the introduction of paid maternity leave in Norway substantially improved maternal health outcomes, in particular for first-time and low-income mothers.

According to a 2016 study, the expansion of government-funded maternity leave in Norway from 18 to 35 weeks had little effect on children&#x27;s schooling. However, when infants bond and have their needs met quickly by caregivers (mothers, fathers, etc.) they will become confident and be prepared to have healthy relationships throughout their life.

Children whose mothers worked in the first 9 months were found to be less ready for school at the age of 3 years. The effects of mothers&#x27; employment appeared to be the most detrimental when employment started between the sixth and ninth month of life. The reasons for this were uncertain, but there is conjecture that there was something unusual for the group of mothers who returned to work in this time period as they represented only 5% of all families studied. Negative impacts in terms of school-readiness were most pronounced when the mother worked at least 30 hours per week. These findings were complicated by many factors, including race, poverty, and how sensitive the mother was considered. The effects were also greater in boys, which is explained by the fact that many analysts consider boys more vulnerable to stress in early life.

The same Harvard report also linked paid parental leave and a child&#x27;s psychological health. It found that parents with paid parental leave had closer bonds with their children. Based on research of heterosexual couples, better immersion of the father in the process of raising a child can lead to improved development outcomes for the child and a better relationship between the parents. In recent years, various OECD countries drew attention to the topic, especially to the time of the parental leave taken by fathers, and concluded that short-term paternal leaves still lead to positive outcomes for the child&#x27;s development. Families do take into account relative income levels of each parent when planning for parental leave; the partner earning a lower wage may be more likely to take parental leave. There is also often workplace pressure on men not to take paternity leave, or to take less than the maximum time allowed. To counteract these pressures and encourage paternity leave, some countries have experimented with making paternity leave mandatory or otherwise incentivizing it.

There are also observable improvements in the mental health of mothers when they are able to return to work later. While the probability of experiencing postpartum depression had no significant statistical change, longer leave (leave over 10 weeks) was associated with decreased severity of depression and decreased number of experienced symptoms. This reduction was, on average, between 5% and 10%.

Studies looking for a connection between paid parental leave have shown conflicting results. Some research looked at women 25–34 years old, who are more likely to be affected by leave legislation. Fertility rates peaked for those between 25–29 and 30–34 across European countries. Conversely, however, research in Spain found that after the introduction of two weeks of paid paternity leave, fertility rates fell suggesting that, when fathers are more engaged in raising children, they may become more aware of the challenges; their priorities may shift to quality over quantity of children; or that mothers are better able to remain connected to the workforce.

A study of a 2012 law in Sweden that allowed fathers to take up to 30 days of paid family leave in the first year after the birth of the child at the same time as the mother was on leave led to substantial improvements in the mental and physical health of mothers.

=== On economy ===
The economic consequences of parental leave policies are subject to controversy. According to a 2016 study, the expansion of government-funded maternity leave in Norway from 18 to 35 weeks had net costs that amounted to 0.25% of GDP, negative redistribution properties and implied a considerable increase in taxes at a cost to economic efficiency. In the U.S., paid family leave tends to lead to a higher employee retention rate and higher incomes for families. Evidence from selected countries in Western Europe suggests that moderate levels of parental leave can encourage mothers to reenter the work force after having children, promoting national economic development.

=== On gender equality ===
Parental leave policies have an impact on gender equality as it relates to parenting and are therefore used by various countries as a tool to promote gender equality. Many countries have implemented paid parental leave policies for both parents, while a minority of countries, like the United States, only have unpaid parental leave. A father&#x27;s quota, which reserves a part of the leave period exclusively for the father, is sometimes assumed to promote gender equality, although the extent and effects are subject to debate.

As more women have joined the formal labor force, the lack of men&#x27;s participation in parenting has been called out as a key example of gender inequality. Various studies highlight the importance of egalitarian parental leave policies in achieving equal distribution of childcare between parents. Moreover, when discussing parental leave policies, the focus is often on comparing improvements in maternity leave policies to what was available in the past, rather than comparing the impact of diverse policies around the world that distribute parental leave differently between both parents.

Statistics show a positive correlation between maternity leave policies and women&#x27;s employment, but the causation relationship cannot be firmly established. While many believe that maternity leave policies encourage women&#x27;s participation in the labor force, Anita Nyberg suggests that it is the other way around: that development of maternity leave policies was a response to women&#x27;s participation in the labor force.

Economist Christopher Ruhm argues that men&#x27;s involvement in childcare at the same level as women is essential for eliminating differences in gender roles. Thus, an increase in the use of parental leave by women (and lack thereof by men) will have a negative impact on gender equality. Inversely, an increase in the use of leave by men will have a positive impact. Transferable leave policies appear to be fair and equal in theory, since they do not specifically allocate leave focused on childcare to women and even allow the family to choose. In practice, however, it leads to the majority of available parental leave being used by women. The Norwegian Association for Women&#x27;s Rights, summarizing different studies, states that there is only limited evidence to support a relationship between the father&#x27;s quota and gender equality; the few relevant studies point in different directions; the association&#x27;s former president, psychologist and former chairman of UNICEF Torild Skard, argues that psychological research does not support the assertion that mothers can be replaced by fathers in the first year. A Norwegian study from 2018 found that an extension of the father&#x27;s quota had no effect on gender equality.

Through examination of leave policies in twenty-one European countries by describing the existing policy schemes&#x27; duration, payment, and transferability, Carmen Castro-Garcia created the Parental Leave Equality Index (PLEI), which can predict the participation of each parent in raising their children based on their gender and the existing policy regarding parental leave. His model shows that a policy that provides equal, nontransferable, and well-paid leave for each parent (which no country has at the moment) will best encourage men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s equal participation in childcare.

==== European Union ====

The European Union recognizes the ability for countries to utilize varying parental leave policies to affect labor force participation, the labor market, maternal health, the work–life balance of parents, and the physical and emotional development of children. And by affecting the work–life balance of parents, it may reduce the barriers to participation of both parents in parenting. More specifically, paternity and parental leave policies are key to encouraging fathers&#x27; involvement in parenting the child.

In 2014, the European Parliament concluded that, by promoting the uptake of parental leave and paternity leave by fathers, governments can aim to facilitate a more gender-equal distribution of care work, support mothers&#x27; return to the labor market, equalize the circumstances in which women and men enter the labor market, and improve the work–life balance of families.

Findings by the European Parliament in 2015 found that 18 of the EU-28 countries offer paternity leave, and that the EU-average length is 12.5 days, ranging from one day in Italy to 64 working days in Slovenia. For 23 EU member states, on average only 10 percent of fathers take parental leave, ranging from 0.02 percent in Greece to 44 per cent in Sweden.

The gender difference in the employment rate is representative of the gender employment gap; filling this gap is an important objective in promoting gender equality and is a part of the Europe 2020 target of an employment rate of 75 per cent for both men and women. The uptake of leave by fathers can reduce the motherhood penalty by enabling mothers to return to the labor market, as illustrated by studies that have shown that the involvement of fathers in childcare has a positive effect on mothers&#x27; full-time employment.

Reduction of the gender pay gap (GPG) is also an important goal for the EU. In 2014 the GPG in the EU-28 was 16.1 percent, which means that for every euro men got paid in the EU, women got paid 83.9 cents. (The GPG exists equally after correction for occupation and education level.) A study done on the gender pension gap estimates the gap to be around 40 percent, which is more than twice the gender pay gap. Increased leave uptake by fathers can reduce the length of career interruptions for women, reduce part-time work by women and potentially reduce the GPG, all of which are leading causes of the gender pension gap.

==== Nordic countries ====
The advancement of gender equality has also been on the political agenda of Nordic countries for decades. Although all Nordic countries have extended the total leave period, their policies towards father&#x27;s quota are different.

In Iceland, each parent receives paid leaves, and each parent can transfer a month to the other (therefore there are two transferable months between the parents). In Sweden, 90 days cannot be transferred from one parent to the other—i.e. each parent gets at least 90 days of parental leave, thus the quota applies equally to both parents and is not specifically fathers. In total, Sweden offers new parents 480 days of parental leave and these days can be used up until the child is 12 years old. The only Nordic country that does not provide fathers with a quota is Denmark, where women have the right to four weeks parent leave before giving birth and 14 weeks leave after giving birth. Thereafter, 32 weeks of parent leave are voluntarily divided between the man and the woman, making eight months leave entirely up to the family to decide. However, the dual earner/dual care model seems to be the direction of all the Nordic countries are moving in the construction of their parental leave systems.

A study done in Norway found that when parental leave is granted for both parents, there is still gender inequality observed in the form of mothers being more likely to have part-time jobs compared to their partners. Since then, the government has provided child care support for parents who want them in order to encourage mothers to return to full-time jobs earlier, and it is effective to a certain extent.

==== Germany ====

In Germany, original laws tackling gender inequality with respect to parenting date back to 1986 in both Eastern and Western Germany, where one parent could take up to two years of leave after the birth of the child with a maximum allowance. According to a study done in 2006, 97% of the people who took the leave were mothers.

In 2007, declining birth rates and demographic change led to a new law, the &quot;Parenting Benefits and Parental Leave Law&quot; (Bundeselterngeld- und Elternzeit-Gesetz). This change in family policy had mainly two aims: to reduce parents&#x27; financial loss in the first year after childbirth, and to encourage fathers to actively participate in childcare by taking parental leave.

With this shift in paradigm, a better work–life balance and less support for the male breadwinner model was targeted. This was part of a &quot;sustainable family policy&quot; promoted by German unification and European integration with the underlying objective to raise birth rates by providing financial incentive.

The law&#x27;s impact was mainly perceived positively with men reporting high motivation to take leave. So far this has not been reflected in official statistics, but Susanne Vogl concludes that if there is a general willingness of men to participate in parental leave the new Parenting Benefits regulations will help facilitate the actual decision to take a leave.

==== United States ====

Even though, according to a survey conducted by WorldatWork and Mercer in 2017, 93% of Americans agree that mothers should receive paid parental leave and 85% agree that fathers should receive paid parental leave, as of October 2018 the United States does not have nationwide laws that guarantee paid parental leave to its workforce; however, certain states have passed laws providing paid workers with such rights. As of April 2022, ten states (California, New Jersey, Rhode Island, New York, Washington, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Oregon, Colorado, and Maryland) and the District of Columbia have enacted laws that grant parental leave as part of state paid family and medical leave insurance laws, with 4 being effective currently. In states without such laws, a proportion of companies do provide paid parental leave.

According to Eileen Appelbaum, the lack of parental leave policies results in many low-income families struggling to support themselves financially if both parents are off work. As a result, many mothers leave work to take care of their children while the father remains at work to financially support the family.

The group of mothers that uses maternity leave most often in the United States are White, non-Hispanic women and the usage of paid maternity leave is drastically lower among Black and Hispanic mothers. The groups of women that have the most access and opportunity to use maternity leave are often reported as having a higher level of income and full-time employment. Statistically, Black women are half as likely to take leave as compared to White women. Black people are substantially less likely to take maternity or parental leave, which is due to structural factors including racial and ethnic discrimination in the workforce. Black women have less access to resources that allow them to take leave or provide care for family members, and Hispanic women are faced with the same issues. These disadvantages lead to lower socioeconomic statuses of Black and Hispanic people in the United States, which also contribute to a lack of opportunity for paid maternity leave and a lack of the financial resources needed to be able to afford taking unpaid or partially paid parental leave. Black and Hispanic workers are less likely to work in professional-class jobs, and therefore are less likely to have access to benefits like paid leave that come with such jobs. Black parents are frequently employed in the public sector, which also may exclude them from paid family leave opportunities. When a lack of access to paid or unpaid maternity or parental leave is reported, Black and Hispanic women are more likely to have higher risks of maternal and child health problems. Non-Hispanic Black women are more likely to die from complications of pregnancy than Non-Hispanic White women in the United States.

==== Australia ====
The Australian government provides paid parental leave (PPL) for both parents, but more for the mother compared to the father. Michael Bittman stated that the reason they provide parental leave is unique in that they view children as &quot;public goods&quot; and, therefore, the state is responsible to provide and support the child. But like most places around the world, studies done in Australia show that the inequality still persists within the family, and that women spend more time doing unpaid work (like parenting) compared to men.

==== China ====
According to a study done by Nan Jia, during the Maoist era, women&#x27;s full participation in the labor force played a key role in the Chinese government&#x27;s efforts to advance women&#x27;s position in society. To facilitate women&#x27;s labor force participation, the Chinese government initiated a series of measures to mitigate the work–family conflict that women face during pregnancy and childbirth. These measures included an entitlement to 56 days of paid maternity leave.

In the post-reform era, a series of new regulations have been introduced to protect women&#x27;s employment and reproductive rights in the new market economy. The Labor Law adopted in 1995 ensured that women and men have equal employment rights and that employers will not lay off women employees or lower their wages for reasons of marriage, pregnancy, maternity leave, or breastfeeding. The Labor Contract Law enacted in 2008 introduced the provision that prohibits employers from unilaterally terminating labor contracts with women employees who are pregnant, give birth, and care for a baby postpartum. Thus, under the Labor Law and Labor Contract Law, women employees are entitled to job-protected maternity leave.

The post-reform era saw further improvements in maternity benefits. The length of paid maternity leave was extended from 56 days prior to reform, to 90 days in 1988, and to 98 days in 2012. Most recently in 2016, paid maternity leave was extended to a minimum of 128 days after the long-standing one-child policy was replaced with a policy that encourages each couple to have two children. This latest extension of paid leave aims to increase fertility rates and slow the population aging process.

=== On relationships ===
A 2020 study in the &quot;Economic Journal&quot; found that reforms in Iceland that incentivized fathers to take parental leave reduced the likelihood of parents separating. The strongest impact was on relationships where the mother was more educated than or equally educated as the father.

== Private parental leave ==
Some businesses adopt policies that are favorable to workers and public opinion. In their study of maternity leave policies in the United States, Kelly and Dobbin found that public policy surrounding pregnancy as a temporary disability (for instance, California&#x27;s Family Temporary Disability Insurance program) gave rise to business practices that included maternity leave as a benefit.

Companies are starting to offer paid parental leave as a benefit to some American workers, seeing a profitable aspect of doing so, including: reduced turnover costs, increased productivity from workers, and increased rates of retention among women after childbirth. Some see the increase in paid parental leave as indicative of companies reaching out to women, as more women are working and returning to work after having children, and by doing so these companies generate positive publicity as employers with family-friendly workplaces. &quot;Working Mother&quot; magazine publishes a list of the 100 Best Companies for working mothers each year, a list which is noted not only by the readership of the magazine, but also by corporate America and increasingly by researchers and policy institutes as well. The Institute for Women&#x27;s Policy Research issued a report in 2009 encouraging Congress to give federal workers four weeks of paid parental leave. The report cited statistics from the &quot;Working Mother&quot; 100 Best Company list, using private sector corporations as examples of substantial increase in the retention of new mothers after instituting a longer maternity leave policy. The report also noted that it would take newer workers four years to accrue enough paid leave (sick leave and annual leave) to equal the 12 weeks of unpaid parental leave provided under the FMLA, and that private sector companies that offer paid parental leave have a significant advantage over the federal government in the recruitment and retention of younger workers who may wish to have children.

As of February 2018, multinational companies such as Deloitte, TIAA and Cisco were providing parental leave regardless of the parent&#x27;s gender.

== By continent ==
The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women introduces &quot;maternity leave with pay or with comparable social benefits without loss of former employment, seniority or social allowances&quot;. The Maternity Protection Convention C 183 adopted in 2000 by International Labour Organization requires 14 weeks of maternity leave as minimum condition.

National laws vary widely according to the politics of each jurisdiction. As of 2012, only two countries do not mandate paid time off for new parents: Papua New Guinea and the United States.

Unless otherwise specified, the information in the tables below is gathered from the most recent International Labour Organization reports. Maternity leave refers to the legal protection given to the mother immediately after she gives birth (but may also include a period before the birth), paternity leave to legal protection given to the father immediately after the mother gives birth, and parental leave to protected time for childcare (usually for either parent) either after the maternity/paternity leave or immediately after birth (for example when the parent is not eligible for paternal leave or where the time is calculated until the child is a specific age—therefore excluding parental leave—usually such jurisdictions protect the job until the child reaches a specific age). Others allow the parental leave to be transferred into part-time work time. Parental leave is generally available to either parent, except where specified. Leave marked &quot;Unpaid&quot; indicates the job is protected for the duration of the leave. Different countries have different rules regarding eligibility for leave and how long a parent has to have worked at their place of employment prior to giving birth before they are eligible for paid leave. In the European Union, the policies vary significantly by country—with regard to length, to payment, and to how parental leave relates to prior maternity leave—but the EU members must abide by the minimum standards of the Pregnant Workers Directive and Parental Leave Directive.

=== Luxembourg ===
Parents in Luxembourg are entitled to parental leave for both childbirth and adoption. When the mother gives birth, regardless of whether she is an employee, self-employed or an apprentice, she is entitled to pre-natal maternity leave of 8 weeks before the expected due date and 12 weeks&#x27; post-natal leave. The father, meanwhile, gets 10 days&#x27; leave after the birth, which must be taken within 2 months of the child&#x27;s birth. For adoptions, one of parents can take up to 12 weeks&#x27; leave if the adopted child is under the age of 12. Luxembourg provides a fixed compensation rate during parental leave, which is €1,778, while most of the other European countries get compensation as a percentage of the salary. Luxembourg doesn&#x27;t have a policy for maternity allowance in place or in addition to the maternity leave pay. Maternity allowance means the money paid during pregnancy or just after child birth. According 2013 OECD data, public expenditure on maternal and paternal leaves on per child born was the most in Luxembourg out of almost all the European counties at the 35,000 at prices and PPPs of 2013 in USD.

On 1 December 2016, &quot;family leave reform bill 7060&quot; was passed in the Luxembourg parliament. According to this new reform, now fathers and mothers can take leave together. The first leave has to be taken right after maternity leave and the second can be taken before the child turns 6 years old. This new reform provides much more flexibility. The parent has four options: either they can take 4 to 6 months&#x27; full leave, 8 to 12 months&#x27; part-time leave, take one day off per week for 20 months or can take 4 individual months within 20 months. The official Luxembourg government portal suggests that according to the data collected more than 85% of the parents are extremely happy with this new reform and 79% people think that this new system is better than the older system.

=== France ===
In France, there is maternity leave, paternity/partner leave and parental leave. The maternity leave, the number of weeks a biological mother is allowed to leave work is 16 weeks in France—6 weeks before birth and 10 weeks post-birth. Maternity leave is 26 weeks for the third and subsequent children, and 34 weeks for twins. Maternity leave is mandatory, the mother must take at least part of the leave, complete renouncement of the leave is forbidden. Paternity/partner leave is 25 days. Parental leave in France (Congé Parental) refers to the system of leave that is guaranteed to both fathers and mothers in cases of either childbirth or adoption, and can be taken for up to three years. In France, there are differences regarding the regulation on parental leave, based on number of children, how it is shared between parents, payment, and type of job. Payment varies between six months and three years.

=== India ===
Maternity leave in India is 26 weeks (8 prenatal and 18 postnatal) and is paid at 100% rate of the employee&#x27;s salary. India&#x27;s maternity leave policy is regulated by The Code on Social Security, 2020. The employee must have worked in the company for at least 80 working days before availing this benefit and the woman would also be entitled to a medical bonus alongside the 100% paid leave. For women with already two children, the maternity leave reduces to 12 weeks. Only employees of state-owned enterprises and civil servants are entitled to paternity leave which is two weeks, while women civil servants are entitled to one year worth of parental leave, including the maternity leave.

=== Germany ===
Maternity leave in Germany is 14 weeks (6 prenatal and 8 postnatal), and parental leave is 3 years. Parents in Germany can request up to 3 years parental leave, which is partly paid with parental allowance. Parental leave can be taken immediately after maternity leave (the weeks of maternity leave after birth are included in the duration of the parental leave) or immediately after birth (for fathers) or it may be taken at later times. Parental leave can be taken all in a go, or in a fractioned way. It can be taken all before the child&#x27;s 3rd birthday, or it may be extended until the 8th birthday; however at least one year must be taken before the third birthday (otherwise that year is lost). All parents who have legal parental rights are entitled to parental leave (including non-biological and same-sex). Parental allowance is paid during part of the parental leave; the amount and duration of payment has changed several times throughout the years. It is possible to be on parental leave and work a limited amount of hours, without losing the parental leave benefits. The advantage of working while on parental leave is that vacation (annual leave) continues to accrue, if one does not work at all on parental leave, that person&#x27;s vacation leave entitlement reduces by one twelfth for each month during which one is taking parental leave (i.e. after a full year of parental leave the vacation entitlement for next year has been lost, unless there are remainder vacation days which had been accumulated before the parental leave, or unless the employer agrees otherwise). Parental leave is job protected, the employee has the right to return to the same job, or in certain situations, to a different position that is similar to the previous one.

=== Canada ===
Canada has two parental leave benefit programs for the care of a newborn or adopted child: a federal program, and provincial programs. Every Canadian province offers at least seventeen weeks of maternity leave, with the exception of Alberta - where maternity leave is fifteen weeks long. The eligibility for maternity leave is that the individual has to be the child&#x27;s birth mother (including surrogate mother). There have to be at least 15 weeks leave (maternity leave can start up to 12 weeks before birth). In addition to maternity leave, there is parental leave, the length of which depends on payment: there is an option between &quot;standard parental leave&quot; up to 40 weeks (but one parent cannot receive more than 35 weeks) which is paid at the rate of 55% up to $638 weekly; and &quot;extended parental leave&quot; up to 69 weeks (but one parent cannot receive more than 61 weeks) which is paid at the rate of 33% up to $383.

Due to parental leave being under provincial jurisdiction, there is a decentralized nature to the policies concerning leave benefit programs. For example, the province of Quebec has some of the greatest maternity leave benefits in the country. In Quebec, a greater number of people are eligible for parental leave benefits and there are more benefits they can receive, compared to other provinces. The variety among provinces concerning parental leave has raised debates on whether there should be a unitary federal program for parental leave policies in Canada.

===United Kingdom (parental bereavement leave)===
Statutory Parental Bereavement Leave is available under UK legislation to the parents of a child who dies under the age of 18, or where a child is stillborn after 24 weeks of pregnancy. In Northern Ireland this entitlement was provided for in the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act (Northern Ireland) 2022.

== Miscarriage leave ==
In some countries, parental leave is also offered to parents who have had a miscarriage. 
*The Philippines - 60 days&#x27; fully paid leave for the mother for miscarriages (before 20 weeks of gestation) or emergency termination of the pregnancy (on the 20th week or after) The husband of the mother gets 7 days&#x27; fully paid leave up to the 4th pregnancy.
*India - six weeks&#x27; leave for the mother
*Mauritius - two weeks&#x27; leave for the mother
*Indonesia - six weeks&#x27; leave for the mother
*New Zealand - 3 days&#x27; bereavement leave for both parents
*Taiwan - five days, one week or four weeks, depending on how advanced the pregnancy was, for the mother

<text>Software verification is a discipline of software engineering, programming languages, and theory of computation whose goal is to assure that software satisfies the expected requirements.

== Broad scope and classification ==

A broad definition of verification makes it related to software testing. In that case, there are two fundamental approaches to verification:
* &quot;Dynamic verification&quot;, also known as experimentation, dynamic testing or, simply testing. - This is good for finding faults (software bugs).
* &quot;Static verification&quot;, also known as analysis or, static testing - This is useful for proving the correctness of a program. Although it may result in false positives when there are one or more conflicts between the process a software really does and what the static verification assumes it does.

Under the ACM Computing Classification System, software verification topics appear under &quot;Software and its engineering&quot;, within &quot;Software creation&quot;, whereas Program verification also appears under Theory of computation under Semantics and reasoning, Program reasoning.

== Dynamic verification (Test, experimentation) ==

Dynamic verification is performed during the execution of software, and dynamically checks its behavior; it is commonly known as the Test phase.
Verification is a Review Process.
Depending on the scope of tests, we can categorize them in three families:
* &quot;Test in the small&quot;: a test that checks a single function or class (Unit test)
* &quot;Test in the large&quot;: a test that checks a group of classes, such as
** Module test (a single module)
** Integration test (more than one module)
** System test (the entire system)
* &quot;Acceptance test&quot;: a formal test defined to check acceptance criteria for a software
** Functional test
** Non functional test (performance, stress test)

The aim of software dynamic verification is to find the errors introduced by an activity (for example, having a medical software to analyze bio-chemical data); or by the repetitive performance of one or more activities (such as a stress test for a web server, i.e. check if the current product of the activity is as correct as it was at the beginning of the activity).

== Static verification (Analysis) ==

Static verification is the process of checking that software meets requirements by inspecting the code before it runs. For example:
* &quot;Code conventions verification&quot;
* &quot;Bad practices (anti-pattern) detection&quot;
* Software metrics calculation
* Formal verification

Verification by Analysis - The analysis verification method applies to verification by investigation, mathematical calculations, logical evaluation, and calculations using classical textbook methods or accepted general use computer methods. Analysis includes sampling and correlating measured data and observed test results with calculated expected values to establish conformance with requirements.

== Narrow scope ==
When it is defined more strictly, verification is equivalent only to static testing and it is intended to be applied to artifacts. And, validation (of the whole software product) would be equivalent to dynamic testing and intended to be applied to the running software product (not its artifacts, except requirements). Notice that requirements validation can be performed statically and dynamically (See artifact validation).

== Comparison with validation ==

Software verification is often confused with software validation. The difference between &quot;verification&quot; and &quot;validation&quot;:
* Software &quot;verification&quot; asks the question, &quot;Are we building the product right?&quot;; that is, does the software conform to its specifications? (As a house conforms to its blueprints.)
* Software &quot;validation&quot; asks the question, &quot;Are we building the right product?&quot;; that is, does the software do what the user really requires? (As a house conforms to what the owner needs and wants.)

<doc id="665990" wikidata="Q1751581" url="?curid=665990" title="Knife throwing">
<text>Knife throwing is an art, sport, combat skill, or variously an entertainment technique, involving an artist skilled in the art of throwing knives, the weapons thrown, and a target. In some stage performances, the knife thrower ties an assistant to the target (sometimes known as a &quot;target girl&quot;) and throws to miss them.

==Basic principles==
Knife throwing, whether in a martial or sport application, involves the same basic principles of mechanics. The objective in each case is for the point to stick into the target with a sufficient amount of force. For this to be successful, accuracy, distance, number of rotations and placement of the body all must be taken into account.

If the thrower uses a spin technique, the knife will rotate during flight. This means that the thrower, assuming they are throwing the same way every time, must either choose a specific distance for each type of throw or, more practically, make slight adjustments to the placement of the knife in the hand or to the throwing movement. Another adjustment that can be made is the way the knife is held. If it is held at the blade when it is thrown, this makes it spin half, whereas if it is held by the handle, this makes a full spin. So if the thrower estimates he needs one and a half spins for the point to hit the target, he would hold the knife from the blade when it is thrown. If he feels he needs two full spins for it to hit the target point-first, then it would be held by the handle.

With the much more intricate no-spin throwing techniques, the throwing motion is made as linear as possible, the knife&#x27;s rotation being slowed even more by an index finger on the spine during release. Thrown no-spin, knives will make no revolution or only a quarter spin before reaching the target (point first), but no-spin throws are not as accurate or stable in flight as spin techniques. The knife does not need to be sharp to stick; as long as it has a point, it will stick into the target.

==Sport==

In the US and in many European countries, there are communities of people pursuing knife throwing as a sport, similar to archery. For example, in Europe more than 30 knife throwing clubs exist.

The competition itself consists, in the most common form, of a series of straight throws aimed at a set of standard wooden targets or in some cases foam. Similar to an archery target, competition knife throwing targets have a bullseye surrounded by one or more rings. A sticking knife scores points. The thrower must be standing at least a set distance away from the target, with higher distances for more challenging events. IKTHOF keeps a ranking of its members based on their performance during these sponsored competitions. EuroThrowers maintains a register of the world records, and for each championship publishes the full scores together with the meetings&#x27; reports.

=== World Knife Throwing League ===
Founded in 2021, the World Knife Throwing League (WKTL) is the largest global governing body of knife throwing and exists to promote knife throwing as a professional sport by bringing together throwing clubs with a standardized league and tournament format. 

With members from over 150 member companies (affiliates), the World Axe Throwing League oversees official WKTL league rules, implementing safety protocols, staff training, and facilitating the World Knife Throwing Championships.

==History==
As a performance art, knife throwing was popularized in the US in the late 19th century by traveling acts such as the Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, but has its roots in martial arts and hunting applications. It has been incorporated into the martial disciplines of the Japanese as well as African and Native American tribes. In Central Africa, they were used as weapons of war (thrown horizontally) as well as for ceremonial purposes. In medieval Europe Hans Talhoffer (-1415 – after 1482) and Paulus Hector Mair (1517–1579) both mention throwing daggers in their treaties on combat and weapons. Talhoffer specifies a type of spiked dagger for throwing while Mair describes throwing the dagger at an opponent&#x27;s chest.

==Representations==
The opera &quot;Queen of Knives&quot;, which premiered in Portland, Oregon on May 7, 2010, tells the story of a brother and sister knife throwing act in the midst of the student protests in Birmingham, Alabama in the early 1960s.

<text>Münchenwiler () is a municipality in the Bern-Mittelland administrative district in the canton of Bern in Switzerland.

==History==

Münchenwiler is first mentioned in 1080-81 as &quot;Vilar&quot;. In 1228 it was mentioned as &quot;Vilar les Moinos&quot;.

In 1080-81 the village was given by the brothers Gerold and Rudolf de Vilar to Cluny Abbey. Shortly thereafter a priory was founded, which served as a way station for pilgrims on the Way of St. James. The Priory church was built in 1100, using spolia from the Roman ruins at Avenches. The small priory community normally consisted of a prior and two to four monks. The priory suffered during the local wars of the 14th and 15th centuries. It was damaged during the Battle of Laupen in 1339. Over a century later, in 1448, it was damaged again during the Freiburgkrieg between the emergent city-states of Bern and Fribourg. In 1476 it was damaged a third time during the Burgundian Wars. During the 15th century, the small priory began to lose importance until the office of prior was reduced to a title without power. In 1484, by papal decree, leadership of the priory was transferred to the college of canons of the Munster of Bern. In 1528, Bern adopted the Protestant Reformation. Despite resistance from Fribourg, in 1530 Bern was able to retain control and secularize Münchenwiler.

A village developed outside the walls of the Priory to support the farmers that worked the ecclesiastical fields. A tavern and a mill were built by the Priory and operated as a fief under the Prior. By 1436 it had a communal bakery and a school house. Originally, the villagers attended church in the Priory chapel, but after the Bernese college of canons took over, the residents joined the parish of Morat. Even after Bern adopted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation and spread it to Münchenwiler they remained part of the Murten parish.

In 1535 Bern sold the &quot;Herrschaft&quot; of Münchenwiler to the former Bernese Schultheiss Hans Jakob von Wattenwyl. Over the next two years, under von Wattenwyl, portions of the priory church and priory buildings were converted into a castle. It remained with the von Wattenwyl family until 1612. For the next fifty years it passed through several owners, before the von Graffenried family acquired it in 1668 and held it until 1932. The castle was expanded in 1690 and again in the 19th century. A new chapel was added to the castle in 1886. The von Graffenried family became impoverished in the early 20th century and in 1922 they began to sell some of their property in the area. In 1932 they sold the castle and its remaining park land to a consortium from Neuchâtel. In 1943 the consortium sold it to the Canton of Bern, who converted it into a community Hochschule. Later it became an adult education school before being renovated and converted into a hotel and convention center in 1986–90.

Originally the village had been French speaking, but after it was brought under Bernese control it became a German-speaking village. Beginning in 1738, the village school taught lessons in German. Following the 1798 French invasion, Münchenwiler became part of the Helvetic Republic in the short lived Canton of Sarine et Broye. Under the new Republic, the castle&#x27;s lands were transferred to the municipality. With the collapse of the Helvetic Republic and the Act of Mediation in 1803, Münchenwiler was assigned to the French-speaking Canton of Fribourg. Four years later, through political maneuvering, the Canton of Bern was able to bring the municipality back under its control. In 1898, the Fribourg-Morat-Ins railroad built a station at Münchenwiler-Courgevaux (in Fribourg) which connected the two communities to the Swiss rail network.

In 1895 and again in 2008 attempts by the Canton to merge the two exclaves of Clavaleyres and Münchenwiler failed due to opposition from the residents.

<text>The New Russians ( &quot;novye russkie&quot;) were a newly rich business class who made their fortune in the 1990s in post-Soviet Russia. It is perceived as a stereotypical caricature. According to the stereotype, &quot;New Russians&quot; achieved rapid wealth by using criminal methods during Russia&#x27;s chaotic transition to a market economy.

== Etymology ==
The exact time and place, as well as the authorship of this expression, have not been fully established.

Some suggest that the expression &quot;&quot; (lit. &quot;New Russian&quot;) arose in the Russian-speaking sphere in the ostensibly English-language form &quot;New Russian&quot;, and after that calqued into the Russian-language form. Another theory suggests the term appeared in foreign press and then made its way into Russia. Supporters of the latter theory suggest that the author of the expression was the American journalist Hedrick Smith who published two books about Russia: &quot;The Russians&quot; (1976) and &quot;The New Russians&quot; (1990).

There&#x27;s also a theory that it is more of a pun, playing on the French term &quot;nouveau riche&quot; (i.e. &quot;new rich&quot;), whose meaning is very close to the term &quot;New Russian&quot;. It is worth recalling that during Russia&#x27;s industrial revolution at the end of the 19th century, Russians also used a term that was similar in meaning and use - &quot;skorobogach&quot;, Russian: (literally “gotten-rich-quick man”, a person who very suddenly became wealthy; perhaps an individual with low moral principles).

In the documentary film &quot;With a hard-sign on the end&quot; (), dedicated to the 20th anniversary of the creation of the newspaper &quot;Kommersant&quot; and shown on Channel One on 30 November 2009), author Leonid Parfyonov demonstrates a copy of &quot;Kommersant&quot; from 1992 in which an editorial letter was addressed to the &quot;New Russians&quot;. Parfyonov confirms that the newspaper first introduced this word into daily life, and at first it did not have any negative or ironic connotation, merely serving to describe the representatives of Russia&#x27;s growing business class.

In 2010, chief researcher at the Institute of Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, noted that the “new Russians” were the product of the reforms of the 1990s, giving them the following characteristics: “Physically strong, poorly educated, assertive, devoid of moral values, and materialistic types”.

<text>Margaret Walker (Margaret Abigail Walker Alexander by marriage; July 7, 1915 – November 30, 1998) was an American poet and writer. She was part of the African-American literary movement in Chicago, known as the Chicago Black Renaissance. Her notable works include &quot;For My People&quot; (1942) which won the Yale Series of Younger Poets Competition, and the novel &quot;Jubilee&quot; (1966), set in the South during the American Civil War.

==Biography==
Walker was born in Birmingham, Alabama, to Sigismund C. Walker, a teacher, and Marion (née Dozier) Walker, who helped their daughter by teaching her philosophy and poetry as a child. She was captivated by the bedtime stories her grandmother told her, which were often tales of slavery. She knew at a young age that she wanted to become a writer so that she could write books about people of colour that would not make her feel ashamed. Her family moved to New Orleans when Walker was a young girl. At the age of 15, she showed a few of her poems to Langston Hughes, on a speaking tour at the moment, who recognised her talent. She attended school there, including several years of college at what is now Dillard University, before she moved north to Chicago. With the help of her English professor, E. B. Hungerford, who was also her mentor, Walker learned all the different forms of English poetry, the English metrical system, scansion of a poem, and memorised versification patterns. 

In 1935, Walker received her Bachelor of Arts degree from Northwestern University. In 1936 she began work with the Federal Writers&#x27; Project under the Works Progress Administration of the President Franklin D. Roosevelt administration during the Great Depression. She worked alongside other young writers like Gwendolyn Brooks and Frank Yerby. Her supervisor, Jacob Scher, was so impressed with her talent that he allowed her to work from home on her own material, a privilege accorded no other member of the Illinois staff. She was a member of the South Side Writers Group, which included authors such as Richard Wright, Arna Bontemps, Fenton Johnson, Theodore Ward, and Frank Marshall Davis.

In 1942, she received her master&#x27;s degree in creative writing from the University of Iowa. In 1965, she returned to that school to earn her Ph.D.

Walker married Firnist Alexander in 1943 and moved to Mississippi to be with him. They had four children together and lived in the Medgar Evers Historic District (formerly Elraine Subdivision) in the capital of Jackson.

==Academic career==
Walker became a literature professor at what is today Jackson State University, an historically black college, where she taught from 1949 to 1979. In 1968, Walker founded the Institute for the Study of History, Life, and Culture of Black People (now the Margaret Walker Center) and her personal papers are now stored there. In 1976, she went on to serve as the institute&#x27;s director.

==Literary writing==
In 1942, Walker&#x27;s poetry collection &quot;For My People&quot; won the Yale Series of Younger Poets Competition under the judgeship of editor Stephen Vincent Benét, making her the first black woman to receive a national writing prize. Her &quot;For My People&quot; was considered the &quot;most important collection of poetry written by a participant in the Chicago Black Renaissance before Gwendolyn Brooks&#x27;s &quot;A Street in Bronzeville&quot;.&quot; Richard Barksdale says: &quot;The [title] poem was written when &quot;world-wide pain, sorrow, and affliction were tangibly evident, and few could isolate the black man&#x27;s dilemma from humanity&#x27;s dilemma during the depression years or during the war years.&quot; He said that the power of resilience presented in the poem is a hope Walker holds out not only to black people but to all people, to &quot;all the Adams and Eves.&quot;

Walker&#x27;s second published book (and only novel), &quot;Jubilee&quot; (1966), is the story of a slave family during and after the Civil War, and is based on her great-grandmother&#x27;s life. It took her thirty years to write. Roger Whitlow says: &quot;It serves especially well as a response to white &#x27;nostalgia&#x27; fiction about the antebellum and Reconstruction South.&quot;

This book is considered important in African-American literature. Walker was the first of a generation of women who started publishing more novels in the 1970s.

In 1975, Walker released three albums of poetry on Folkways Records – &quot;Margaret Walker Alexander Reads Poems of Paul Laurence Dunbar and James Weldon Johnson and Langston Hughes&quot;; &quot;Margaret Walker Reads Margaret Walker and Langston Hughes&quot;; and &quot;The Poetry of Margaret Walker&quot;.

Walker received a Candace Award from the National Coalition of 100 Black Women in 1989.

==Court cases==
In 1978, Margaret Walker sued Alex Haley, claiming that his 1976 novel &quot;&quot; had violated &quot;Jubilee&quot;&#x27;s copyright by borrowing from her novel. The case was dismissed.

In 1991, Walker was sued by Ellen Wright, the widow of Richard Wright, on the grounds that Walker&#x27;s use of unpublished letters and an unpublished journal in a just-published biography of Wright violated the widow&#x27;s copyright. &quot;Wright v. Warner Books&quot; was dismissed by the district court, and this judgment was supported by the appeals court.

==Death and legacy==
Walker died of breast cancer in Chicago, Illinois, in 1998, aged 83.

Walker was inducted into The Chicago Literary Hall of Fame in 2014.

Walker was honoured with a historical marker through the Mississippi Writers Trail.

<text>Major League Baseball (MLB) has been broadcast on American television since the 1950s, with initial broadcasts on the experimental station W2XBS, the predecessor of the modern WNBC in New York City. The World Series was televised on a networked basis since 1947, with regular season games broadcast nationally since 1953. Over the forthcoming years, MLB games became major attractions for American television networks, and each of the Big Three networks (ABC, CBS, and NBC) would air packages of baseball games at various times until the year 2000. Fox would rise to major network status, partially on its acquisition of MLB rights in 1996; Fox has been MLB&#x27;s primary broadcast television partner ever since.

MLB broadcasts would later shape the emerging medium of cable television. In particular, out of market baseball would attract customers to superstations in the late 20th Century, such as WGN and WTBS airing Chicago Cubs and Atlanta Braves games, respectively. MLB also played a big role in the growth of ESPN since it began airing games in 1990. TBS, the national feed spun off from WTBS, has also aired nationally televised games since 2007. MLB itself launched its own cable network in 2009, MLB Network, which would also air several live games a week. And MLB broadcasts have been shown on Fox&#x27;s various sister cable networks, with Fox Sports 1 airing games since 2014.

MLB began streaming games via the internet in 2017, with Twitter and Facebook initially acquiring the rights to some games. YouTube and Peacock have since streamed games, and , Apple TV+ and The Roku Channel currently hold packages of MLB games.

Games not picked up by one of the national outlets are instead broadcast by local broadcast stations and regional sports networks, televising their respective local team within their respective region. A number of nationally televised games are also non-exclusive, meaning that the national telecasts may also air in tandem with those of the game by local broadcasters.

As the only team in Canada, the TV rights to the Toronto Blue Jays are a special case: Blue Jays games are aired nationally in that country, with Sportsnet holding the rights since 1999. Sportsnet also carries other MLB games simulcast from a U.S. feed.

==== Timeline ====
===Canada===
Sportsnet and Réseau des sports (RDS) are the current national rightsholders, in English and French respectively, to Major League Baseball, and both air a variety of regular-season games (which do not always correspond to those carried nationally in the U.S.) as well as the All-Star Game and the postseason. In the past these rights were held by The Score (2001–2002), TSN (1990–2000), and CTV (1981–1996). In 2010, Sportsnet began subleasing its rights to &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot; to rival TSN2, in return for TSN yielding its remaining rights to Toronto Blue Jays games to Sportsnet.

As presently the only MLB team in Canada, all Blue Jays games are also aired nationally in that country. These rights are negotiated by the team itself, not MLB, with all games currently airing on the co-owned Sportsnet and Sportsnet One in English, while TVA Sports has French-language rights to selected Blue Jays games. Games that are designated as exclusive to digital platforms (in Canada, this involves games airing on Apple TV+) are the only Blue Jays games that do not air on the Sportsnet channels. Other Canadian broadcasters have carried these games in the past, with TSN being the team&#x27;s main carrier from 1984 to 1998 (and in a lesser role until 2009), and CBC and CTV also providing national coverage of some games at various points over the course of the team&#x27;s history.

Up until 2022, the Blue Jays&#x27; television rightsholders were not allowed to produce their own broadcasts during postseason play, as they were considered a regional broadcaster at the time. For example, during the Blue Jays&#x27; runs to the and World Series, their television partners carried the CBS feed. This remained true even after Sportsnet became the team&#x27;s broadcaster, as their 2015 and 2016 postseason runs were simulcasts of Fox and TBS&#x27; feeds respectively. This is in contrast to the NBA&#x27;s Toronto Raptors (via TSN and Sportsnet), as well as the NHL and MLS&#x27;s Canadian-based teams (via Hockey Night in Canada on CBC and Sportsnet, and TSN respectively) who were allowed to produce their own broadcasts during postseason games. In 2022, however, MLB allowed Sportsnet to carry its own production of Blue Jays postseason games as it is now considered a national broadcaster.

===United Kingdom===
Major League Baseball has been broadcast on a regular basis in the UK since the 1980s. Initially shown on Channel 4, it was also aired on satellite channel Screensport and following Screensport&#x27;s closure in March 1993, Sky Sports took over as the UK&#x27;s broadcaster.

In 1997, newly launched terrestrial broadcaster Channel 5 took over as the rights holder, showing two games a week, including &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot;, under the title of &quot;MLB on Five&quot;. After the 2008 season, Channel 5 decided to end its coverage of Major League Baseball due to the Global recession of 2008–09.

In 2006, NASN bought the rights to show ten live Major League Baseball games a week. and in 2009 NASN is renamed ESPN America following the sale in late 2006 of the channel to ESPN.

In 2013 BT Sport launched and picked up the rights held by ESPN UK, which included Major League Baseball. BT Sport showed MLB throughout its decade on air, broadcasting many games each week. This was supplemented by ESPN-produced baseball magazine shows, including &quot;Baseball Tonight&quot;.

In 2023, TNT Sports replaced BT Sport and it continues to air Major League Baseball, but without the ESPN-produced programming.

Since 2019, a small number of games have been broadcast by the BBC. This began when the Corporation aired coverage of the inaugural MLB London Series. In 2022, the BBC signed a new deal for the London Series, and this also gave the BBC rights to show games played in America for the first time.

==History==
===First broadcast===
After the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair showed the new technology called television, experimental station W2XBS aired the first televised major league baseball games, a double header between the Cincinnati Reds and the Brooklyn Dodgers on August 26, 1939.

===1953–1959===
In , ABC-TV executive Edgar J. Scherick (who would later go on to create &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot;) approached MLB with a Saturday &quot;Game of the Week&quot;. With fewer outlets than CBS or NBC, ABC needed paid programming (or &quot;anything for bills&quot; as Scherick put it). At first, ABC hesitated at the idea of a nationally televised regular season baseball program, but gave Scherick the green light to sign up teams; unfortunately, only three (the Philadelphia Athletics, Cleveland Indians, and Chicago White Sox were interested. To make matters worse, Major League Baseball barred the &quot;Game of the Week&quot; from airing within fifty miles of any big-league city. According to Scherick, Major League Baseball insisted on protecting local coverage and didn&#x27;t care about national appeal. ABC though, did care about the national appeal and claimed that &quot;most of America was still up for grabs.&quot;

CBS took over the Saturday &quot;Game&quot; in 1955 (the rights were actually set up through the Falstaff Brewing Corporation,) retaining Dizzy Dean and Buddy Blattner as the announcers and adding Sunday coverage in .

In , ABC broadcast the best-of-three playoff series (to decide the National League pennant) between Milwaukee Braves and Los Angeles Dodgers. The cigarette company L&amp;M was in charge of all of the telecasts.

===1960–1965===
In , ABC returned to baseball broadcasting with a series of late-afternoon Saturday games. Jack Buck and Carl Erskine were the lead announcing crew for this series, which lasted one season.

ABC typically did three games a week. Two of the games were always from the Eastern or Central Time Zone. The late games (no doubleheaders) were usually San Francisco Giants or Los Angeles Dodgers&#x27; home games. However, the Milwaukee Braves used to start many of their Saturday home games late in the afternoon. So if the Giants and Dodgers were both the road at the same time, ABC still would be able to show a late game.

By 1964, CBS&#x27; Dizzy Dean and Pee Wee Reese worked Yankee Stadium, Wrigley Field, St. Louis, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. New York got $550,000 of CBS&#x27; $895,000. Six clubs that exclusively played nationally televised games on NBC got $1.2 million.

On July 17, , a game out of Los Angeles between the Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Dodgers contest became the first Pay TV baseball game. Subscription television offered the &quot;cablecast&quot; to subscribers for money. (The Dodgers beat the Cubs by the score of 3–2, with Don Drysdale collecting 10 strikeouts.)

ABC paid $5.7 million for the rights to the 28 Saturday/holiday &quot;Games of the Week&quot;. ABC&#x27;s deal covered all of the teams except the New York Yankees and Philadelphia Phillies (who had their own television deals) and called for two regionalized games on Saturdays, Independence Day, and Labor Day. ABC blacked out the games in the home cities of the clubs playing those games.

===1966–1975===
On October 19, 1965, NBC signed a three-year contract with Major League Baseball. The year before, NBC lost the rights to the Saturday–Sunday &quot;Game of the Week&quot;. In addition, the previous deal limited CBS to covering only 12 weekends when its new subsidiary, the New York Yankees, played at home. The new package under NBC called for 28 games compared to 1960&#x27;s three-network 123.

Under the new deal, NBC paid roughly $6 million per year for the 25 &quot;Games of the Week&quot;, $6.1 million for the 1967 World Series and 1967 All-Star Game, and $6.5 million for the 1968 World Series and 1968 All-Star Game. This brought the total value of the contract (which included three Monday night telecasts) up to $30.6 million.

By 1969, Major League Baseball had grown to 24 teams and the net local TV revenues had leaped to $20.7 million. This is in sharp contrast to 1950 when local television brought the then 16 Major League clubs a total net income of $2.3 million. Changes baseball underwent during this time, such as expansion franchises and increasing the schedule from 154 games to 162, led to a wider audience for network and local television.

From 1972–1975 NBC televised Monday games under a contract worth $72 million. In 1973, NBC extended the Monday night telecasts (with a local blackout) to 15 straight. On September 1, 1975, NBC&#x27;s last &quot;Monday Night Baseball&quot; game, in which the Montréal Expos beat the host Philadelphia Phillies 6–5.

In the aftermath of the thrilling 1975 World Series, attendance figures, television contracts (this time including two networks, NBC and now ABC), and player salaries all soared. In the eyes of some, that particular World Series restored baseball as America&#x27;s national pastime (ahead of football).

===1976–1989: ABC and NBC alternate coverage===
Under the initial agreement with ABC, NBC, and Major League Baseball (1976–1979), the two networks paid a combined $92.8 million. ABC paid $12.5 million per year to show 16 Monday night games in 1976, 18 in the next three years, plus half the postseason (the League Championship Series in even numbered years and World Series in odd numbered years). NBC paid $10.7 million per year to show 25 Saturday &quot;Games of the Week&quot; and the other half of the postseason (the League Championship Series in odd numbered years and World Series in even numbered years).

Major League Baseball media director John Lazarus said of the new arrangement between NBC and ABC &quot;Ratings couldn&#x27;t get more from one network so we approached another.&quot; NBC&#x27;s Joe Garagiola wasn&#x27;t very fond of new broadcasting arrangement at first saying &quot;I wished they hadn&#x27;t got half the package. Still, &quot;Game&quot;, half of the postseason – we got lots left.&quot; By 1980, income from TV accounted for a record 30% of the game&#x27;s $500 million in revenues.

In the 1970s the cable revolution began. The Atlanta Braves became a power contender with greater revenues generated by WTBS. Ted Turner&#x27;s Atlanta-based station obtained first local rights to the Braves in the early 1970s. Turner would buy the team a few years later and then greatly expand the reach of WTBS by up-linking it to satellite. WTBS became the first Superstation, and starting with the 1977 season &quot;America&#x27;s Team&quot; was broadcast to cable households nationwide.

In 1980, 22 teams (all but the Atlanta Braves, Houston Astros, New York Mets, and St. Louis Cardinals) took part in a one-year cable deal with UA-Columbia. The deal involved the airing of a Thursday night &quot;Game of the Week&quot; in markets at least 50 miles (80 km) from a major league park. The deal earned Major League Baseball less than $500,000, but led to a new two-year contract for 40–45 games per season.

On April 7, 1983, Major League Baseball, ABC, and NBC agreed to terms of a six-year television package worth $1.2 billion. The two networks would continue to alternate coverage of the playoffs (ABC in even numbered years and NBC in odd numbered years), World Series (ABC would televise the World Series in odd numbered years and NBC in even numbered years), and All-Star Game (ABC would televise the All-Star Game in even numbered years and NBC in odd numbered years) through the 1989 season, with each of the 26 clubs receiving $7 million per year in return (even if no fans showed up). The last package gave each club $1.9 million per year. ABC contributed $575 million for regular season prime time and Sunday afternoons and NBC paid $550 million for thirty Saturday afternoon games.

By 1986, ABC only televised 13 &quot;Monday Night Baseball&quot; games. This was a fairly sharp contrast to the 18 games that were scheduled in 1978. &quot;The Sporting News&quot; believed that ABC paid Major League Baseball to not make them televise the regular season. TSN added that the network only wanted the sport for October anyway.

====Breakdown====
*1983 – $20 million in advance from the two networks.
*1984 – NBC $70 million, ABC $56 million, total $126 million.
*1985 – NBC $61 million, ABC $75 million, total $136 million.
&quot;Note&quot;: The networks got $9 million when Major League Baseball expanded the League Championship Series from a best-of-five to a best-of-seven in 1985.

*1986 – NBC $75 million, ABC $66 million, total $141 million.
*1987 – NBC $81 million, ABC $90 million, total $171 million.
*1988 – NBC $90 million, ABC $96 million, total $186 million.
*1989 – NBC $106 million, ABC $125 million, total $231 million.

===Major League Baseball on CBS and ESPN: 1990–1993===
On December 14, 1988, CBS (under the guidance of Commissioner Peter Ueberroth) paid approximately $1.8 billion for exclusive television rights for over four years (beginning in 1990). CBS paid about $265 million each year for the World Series, League Championship Series, All-Star Game, and the Saturday &quot;Game of the Week&quot;. It was one of the largest agreements (to date) between the sport of baseball and the business of broadcasting.

The deal with CBS was also supposed to pay each team $10 million a year. A separate deal with cable television would bring each team an additional $4 million. Each team could also cut its own deal with local television. For example, the New York Yankees signed with a cable network (MSG) that would pay the team $41 million annually for 12 years. Radio broadcast rights can bring in additional money. Reportedly, after the huge television contracts with CBS and ESPN were signed, franchises spent their excess millions on free agents. In the end, CBS wound up losing approximately half a billion dollars from their television contract with Major League Baseball. CBS repeatedly asked Major League Baseball for a rebate, but MLB wasn&#x27;t willing to do this.

On January 5, 1989, Major League Baseball signed a $400 million deal with ESPN, who would show over 175 games beginning in 1990. For the next four years, ESPN would televise six games a week (Sunday, &quot;Wednesday Night Baseball&quot;, doubleheaders on Tuesdays and Fridays, plus holidays).

The roll out of ESPN, followed by Fox Sports, changed sports news and particularly affected baseball. With games condensed to the thirty-second highlight reel, and the added microscope of news organizations that needed to fill 24 hours of time, the amount of attention paid to major league players magnified to staggering levels compared to where it had been just 20 years prior. It brought with it increased attention for individual players, who reached superstar status nationwide on careers that often were not as compelling as those who had come before them in a less media intense time. This coincided with the rise of television revenues on both a local and national level: by 1993, local television revenue alone surpassed $618 million, which was 15 times greater than it had been in the early 1970s. Accordingly, in the same time period – coupled with free agency and arbitration rights – the average player salary rose roughly tenfold to over $1.3 million.

On April 15, , ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot; with the experienced Jon Miller and Joe Morgan debuted. In its first year, &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot; averaged a 3.0 rating. That was double the number that ESPN as a whole was averaging at the time (1.5). By , ESPN enjoyed its largest baseball audience ever (a 9.5 Nielsen rating) as Mark McGwire hit his 61st home run of the season.

===The Baseball Network: 1994–1995===
After the fall-out from CBS&#x27; financial problems from their four-year-long television contract with Major League Baseball, MLB decided to go into the business of producing the telecasts themselves. After a four-year hiatus, ABC and NBC returned to Major League Baseball under the umbrella of a revenue-sharing venture called The Baseball Network.

Under a six-year plan, Major League Baseball was intended to receive 85% of the first $140 million in advertising revenue (or 87.5% of advertising revenues and corporate sponsorship from the games until sales top a specified level), 50% of the next $30 million, and 80% of any additional money. Prior to this, Major League Baseball was projected to take a projected 55% cut in rights fees and receive a typical rights fee from the networks. When compared to the previous television deal with CBS, The Baseball Network was supposed to bring in 50% less of the broadcasting revenue. The advertisers were reportedly excited about the arrangement with The Baseball Network because the new package included several changes intended to boost ratings, especially among younger viewers.

Arranging broadcasts through The Baseball Network seemed, on the surface, to benefit NBC and ABC since it gave them a monopoly on broadcasting Major League Baseball. It also stood to benefit the networks because they reduced the risk associated with purchasing the broadcast rights outright. NBC and ABC attempted to create a loss-free environment for each other.

After NBC&#x27;s coverage of the 1994 All-Star Game was complete, NBC was scheduled to televise six regular season games on Fridays or Saturdays in prime time. The networks had exclusive rights for the 12 regular season dates, in that no regional or national cable service or over-the-air broadcaster may telecast an MLB game on those dates. &quot;Baseball Night in America&quot; usually aired up to 14 games based on the viewers&#x27; region (affiliates chose games of local interest to carry) as opposed to a traditional coast-to-coast format. ABC would then pick up where NBC left off by televising six more regular season games. The regular season games fell under the &quot;Baseball Night in America&quot; umbrella which premiered on July 16, 1994.

In even numbered years, NBC would have the rights to the All-Star Game and both League Championship Series while ABC would have the World Series and newly created Division Series. In odd numbered years the postseason and All-Star Game television rights were supposed to alternate.

The long-term plans for The Baseball Network crumbled when the players went on strike on August 12, 1994 (thus forcing the cancellation of the World Series). In July 1995, ABC and NBC, who wound up having to share the duties of televising the 1995 World Series as a way to recoup (with ABC broadcasting Games 1, 4, 5 (and 7 had there been one), and NBC broadcasting Games 2, 3, and 6), announced that they were opting out of their agreement with Major League Baseball. Both networks figured that as the delayed 1995 baseball season opened without a labor agreement, there was no guarantee against another strike. Others would argue that a primary reason for its failure was its abandoning of localized markets in favor of more lucrative and stable advertising contracts afforded by turning to a national model of broadcasting. Both networks soon publicly vowed to cut all ties with Major League Baseball for the remainder of the 20th century.

In the end, the venture would lose $95 million in advertising and nearly $500 million in national and local spending.

Also in 1994, ESPN renewed its baseball contract for six years (through the 1999 season). The new deal was worth $42.5 million per year and $255 million overall. The deal was ultimately voided after the 1995 season and ESPN was pretty much forced to restructure their contract.

===Baseball comes to Fox and stays with NBC: 1996–2000===
Soon after the Baseball Network fiasco, Major League Baseball made a deal with Fox and NBC on November 7, 1995. Fox paid a fraction less of the amount of money that CBS paid for the Major League Baseball television rights. Unlike The Baseball Network, Fox went back to the tried and true format of televising regular season games (approximately 16 weekly telecasts that normally began on Memorial Day weekend) on Saturday afternoons. Fox did however, continue a format that The Baseball Network started by offering games based purely on a viewer&#x27;s region. Fox&#x27;s approach has usually been to offer four regionalized telecasts, with exclusivity from 1–4 p.m. in each time zone. When Fox first got into baseball, it used the motto &quot;Same game, new attitude.&quot;

Under the five-year deal (from 1996–2000) for a total of approximately $400 million, NBC didn&#x27;t televise any regular season games. Instead, NBC only handled the All-Star Game and the American League Championship Series in even numbered years and the World Series and National League Championship Series in odd numbered years, in addition to three Division Series games in each of these five years.

Also in 1996, ESPN began a five-year contract with Major League Baseball worth $440 million and about $80 million per year. ESPN paid for the rights to a Wednesday doubleheader and the Sunday night &quot;Game of the Week&quot;, as well as all postseason games not aired on Fox or NBC. Major League Baseball staggered the times of first-round games to provide a full-day feast for viewers: ESPN could air games at 1 p.m., 4 p.m., and 11 p.m. EDT, with the broadcast networks telecasting the prime time game.

1996 also marked the launch of MLB&#x27;s out-of-market sports package, MLB Extra Innings. Debuted exclusively on DirecTV, the service allowed fans to watch regionally televised broadcasts of out-of-market baseball games.

Beginning in 1997, Fox entered a four-year joint venture with Liberty Media Cable (which resulted in the placement of a Thursday night baseball game on Fox Sports Net alongside an FX Saturday night game, Fox Family would later replace Fox Sports Net) worth $172 million. The deal called for two games a week that aired games on its choice of two weeknights other than Wednesday, with no exclusivity.

===2001–2006: Fox and ESPN===
In September 2000, Major League Baseball signed a six-year, $2.5 billion contract with Fox to show Saturday baseball, the All-Star Game, selected Division Series games and exclusive coverage of both League Championship Series and the World Series. Fox&#x27;s sister network FX also aired numerous Major League Baseball contests on Saturday nights in 2001.

Under the previous five-year deal with NBC (1996–2000), Fox paid $115 million while NBC only paid $80 million per year. Fox paid about $575 million overall while NBC paid about $400 million overall. The difference between the Fox and the NBC contracts implicitly values Fox&#x27;s Saturday &quot;Game of the Week&quot; at less than $90 million for five years. Before NBC officially decided to part ways with Major League Baseball (for the second time in about 12 years) on September 26, 2000, Fox&#x27;s payment would&#x27;ve been $345 million while NBC would&#x27;ve paid $240 million. Before 1990, NBC had carried Major League Baseball since 1947.

NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol added that it wasn&#x27;t cost-effective for NBC to be putting out the kind of money that Major League Baseball wanted.

ESPN and ESPN2 also had contracts (which were signed in and ran through ) to show selected weeknight and Sunday night games, along with selected Division Series playoff games. The contracts with ESPN were worth $141.8 million per year and $851 million overall. After Disney bought Fox Family (who from – aired Thursday night games) in to become ABC Family, the Division Series games aired on ABC Family (with ESPN&#x27;s announcers, graphics, and music) for one year. ESPN then added the extra playoff games and Thursday night package to its lineup.

In 2002, Major League Baseball launched Mlb.tv, its digital out-of-market sports package, with a game between the Texas Rangers and the New York Yankees on August 26.

===Fox, Fox Sports 1, TBS, and ESPN era: 2007–2016 ===
OLN (later NBC Sports Network) was briefly considering picking up the rights to Sunday and Wednesday regular season games, which expired after the 2005 season. In September 2005, however, ESPN, then the current rights holder, signed an eight-year contract with Major League Baseball, highlighted by the continuation of ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot; series with additional, exclusive team appearances. The key details of the agreement were:

*Up to 80 regular-season telecasts per year;
*No blackout restrictions on exclusive &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot;; &quot;Monday Night Baseball&quot;, with ESPN mostly coexisting with local carriers
*Up to five appearances per team per year on the exclusive &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot; series, up from 11 over three years;
*Daily &quot;Baseball Tonight&quot; programs – one of ESPN&#x27;s most popular series—including the continued right to show in-progress highlights and live cut-ins;
*MLB Home Run Derby, ESPN&#x27;s highest-rated program of the summer and one of cable&#x27;s best, and additional All-Star programming;
*Continuation of season-long Wednesday baseball on ESPN and ESPN2
*A new afternoon batting practice program, generally from the site of ESPN&#x27;s Monday night telecast;
*For the first time, the 11 pm. ET &quot;SportsCenter&quot; presents a nightly &quot;Baseball Tonight&quot; update featuring in-progress highlights;
*Select games and MLB All-Star events on ESPN2 throughout the season;
*10 spring training games and MLB Opening Day coverage;
*Telecast rights for ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN Deportes and ESPN International;
*Ability to include MLB programming as part of the delivery of the ESPN networks via cable, satellite and other new or developing technologies, such as cell phones and wireless devices;
*Archival footage and game programming and Instant Classic rights for ESPN Classic.

ESPN&#x27;s Monday and Wednesday telecasts were mostly nonexclusive, meaning the games also can be televised by each club&#x27;s local broadcasters. Wednesday games were blacked out in the teams&#x27; local markets (and anywhere their broadcasters reach), except if they would otherwise go untelevised. Monday games were usually saw ESPN co-exist with local broadcasters. The Sunday games remain on ESPN only.

The sport averages $296 million under the new agreement, a television and a baseball official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of a confidentiality agreement in the deal. ESPN paid baseball $273.5 million in , increasing to $293.5 million in each of the following four years, $308.5 million in 2011 and $306 million in each of the final two seasons.

After weeks of speculation and rumors, at the 2006 All-Star Game, Major League Baseball and the Fox Broadcasting Company announced a renewal of their contract through 2013. The contract would continue to give Fox exclusive rights to televise the World Series and the All-Star Game for the duration of the contract. The World Series would begin the Wednesday after the League Championship Series are completed. Fox would also get exclusive rights to televise the American League Championship Series in odd years beginning in 2007, and exclusive rights to televise the National League Championship Series in even years beginning in 2008. Additionally, Fox would have the right to broadcast its regional Saturday &quot;Game of the Week&quot; package for all 26 weeks (up from 18 under the previous contract).

Time Warner&#x27;s TBS secured exclusive rights to televise the National League Championship Series in odd years beginning in 2007, and exclusive rights to televise the American League Championship Series in even years beginning in 2008. Turner&#x27;s contract ran through 2013. As part of the contract, TBS relinquished its rights to air Atlanta Braves games nationally after the 2007 season, by separating WTBS (now WPCH) channel 17 from the TBS network, rebranding as &quot;Peachtree TV&quot; on October 1, 2007. The new station still aired Atlanta Braves games. Those games were made available to local cable and satellite operators in the Southeast for the 2008 season. Additionally, TBS gained rights to a Sunday afternoon &quot;Game of the Week&quot;, beginning in the 2008 season. TBS was allowed to choose the games that it will carry and select a single team up to 13 times. TBS also gained exclusive broadcast rights to the Division Series in both leagues, as well as any tiebreaking games. TBS also gained the rights to the &quot;All-Star Game Selection Show&quot;, meaning that ESPN (which previously carried it) can only broadcast the information after it airs on TBS.

In 2009, MLB launched its own cable network, MLB Network, which picked up its own game packages. MLB Network games typically air during nights on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, as well as selected weekday afternoon games; these games are blacked out in areas where a local broadcaster is carrying the MLB Network game, with alternate games or programming provided in these markets.

In August 2012, it was announced that ESPN and Major League Baseball had agreed on a new eight-year deal that greatly increased the network&#x27;s studio and game content across all of its platforms. The deal also increased ESPN&#x27;s average yearly payment from about $360 million to approximately $700 million. ESPN returned to broadcasting postseason baseball beginning in 2014 with one of two wild-card games each season. The network alternated airing the American League and National League wild-card games each year. It also secured the rights to all potential regular-season tiebreaker games starting in 2014.

In September 2012, &quot;Sports Business Daily&quot; reported that Major League Baseball would agree to separate eight-year television deals with Fox Sports and Turner Sports through the 2021 season. Fox would reportedly pay around $4 billion over eight years (close to $500 million per year) while Turner would pay around $2.8 billion over eight years (more than $300 million per year). Under the new deals, Fox and TBS&#x27;s coverage would essentially be the same as in the 2007–2013 contract with the exception of Fox and TBS splitting coverage of the Division Series, which TBS had broadcast exclusively dating back to 2007. More importantly, Fox would carry some of the games (such as the Saturday afternoon &quot;Game of the Week&quot;) on its all-sports channel, Fox Sports 1. Sources also said that was possible that Fox would sell some Division Series games to MLB Network, which did end up occurring.

On October 2, 2012, the new deal between Major League Baseball and Fox was officially confirmed.
*12 Saturday afternoon games on Fox (down from 26).
*40 games on cable outlets (Fox Sports 1; Fox Sports 2; FX or FXX for overflow).

=== 2017–present: Internet streaming comes of age ===
MLB began streaming games via the internet (outside the MLB.tv platform) during the 2017 season. Twitter announced that it would stream weekly MLB games out-of-market on Fridays, with the first game on April 7 between the Chicago Cubs and Milwaukee Brewers. On May 18, Facebook followed with their own announcement of MLB games, streaming a Colorado Rockies-Cincinnati Reds game that evening. Twenty games, simulcasted from one of the local rightsholders, would be streamed on the platform during the 2017 season. Facebook opted to stream its games on Fridays, moving Twitter&#x27;s live game presentations to Tuesdays. MLB later followed with a weekly exclusive game on Facebook for 2018, in addition to continuing its partnership with Twitter for the same season.

On November 15, 2018, Fox renewed its rights, which were set to expire in 2022, through 2028. The contract maintains Fox&#x27;s current coverage structure, but with expanded digital rights, and the commitment to air more games on the Fox broadcast network when the new deal takes effect. Fox also committed to airing at least two of its League Championship Series games, as well as any Game 7, on the broadcast network beginning in 2020; it had been criticized for airing only Game 1 of the 2019 American League Championship Series, while placing the rest on Fox Sports 1.

For the 2019 season, MLB scaled back its partnership with Facebook, limiting it to 6 non-exclusive games for the season. It later announced that YouTube would exclusively stream 13 weekly games in the second half of the season. YouTube would later air four games during the truncated 2020 season, before expanding to 21 games in 2021.

The expanded playoffs during the truncated 2020 season required a temporary deal for rights to the eight Wild Card Series. Under the deal, TBS aired one Wild Card Series (Toronto Blue Jays-Tampa Bay Rays), while the ESPN networks aired the remaining seven series. As part of the ESPN deals, ABC aired MLB games for the first time since 1995.

Turner Sports agreed to a seven-year deal to renew its MLB rights from 2022 through 2028; the deal was finalized in September 2020. As part of the new deals, Turner Sports moves its current Sunday afternoon broadcasts to Tuesday nights. Marchand later reported that ESPN would also renew its rights to Major League Baseball in December 2020; the renewal was confirmed on May 13, 2021. The deal removed ESPN&#x27;s non-exclusive weeknight games from the schedule, but retains &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot; and ESPN&#x27;s involvement in the Wild Card playoffs.

During the 2021 season, a three game series played between June 18 and 20 between the Philadelphia Phillies and the San Francisco Giants, whose regional television rights are both held by the NBC Sports Regional Networks, aired nationally on NBC&#x27;s streaming service Peacock. Later that season, ABC aired its first regular season MLB game since the 1990s, a presentation of ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot; between the Chicago White Sox and the Chicago Cubs, on August 8.

In March 2022, Apple Inc. announced that it had acquired the exclusive rights to a weekly doubleheader to be branded &quot;Friday Night Baseball&quot; for its Apple TV+ service. On March 9, Mike Ozanian, staff sports business writer for &quot;Forbes&quot;, reported that MLB had also reached a deal with NBC to stream the Monday and Wednesday night games on Peacock, however this would later be revised to Sunday afternoon games. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; would later report that MLB and Peacock were finalizing a deal to air games on Sunday afternoons; as part of the reported agreement, the first game on the service would be simulcast on NBC, which would be its first MLB game broadcast since 2000. On April 6, NBC Sports confirmed that they had acquired a package of Sunday afternoon games to begin May 8, the initial game of which would be also simulcast on the NBC network. The deal would give Peacock an exclusive window of games on Sundays, starting before 1:30 pm Eastern time. MLB later reached a deal with YouTube, reducing its game inventory to 15 games for 2022. This would be the last year MLB games would appear on YouTube, as the website did not broadcast any MLB games in 2023. MLB Sunday Leadoff on Peacock continued into 2023, but the deal expired at the end of the season and was not renewed before the start of the 2024 season. The Roku Channel took over the MLB Sunday Leadoff package starting in May 2024.

On February 20, 2025, Major League Baseball and ESPN exercised a mutual opt-out on their seven-year deal that would have ended in 2028. As a result, ESPN would air its final MLB broadcasts during the 2025 season, marking the end of the network&#x27;s 36-year relationship with the league.

==Regional broadcasters==
Major League Baseball games not broadcast exclusively by its national media partners are televised by local broadcast stations and regional sports networks, which present sports programming of interest to their respective region. Most MLB broadcasters are members of chains such as NBC Sports Regional Networks and Bally Sports although several teams are broadcast by regional networks that are independent of these chains. Some teams own partial or majority stakes in their regional broadcaster. Regionally broadcast MLB games are subject to blackouts; games from outside of a viewer&#x27;s designated market are blacked out to protect the regional team.

Certain national regular season telecasts on ESPN, FS1, and TBS, as well as all MLB Network regular season telecasts, are non-exclusive, and may also air in tandem with telecasts of the game by local broadcasters. However, national telecasts of these games may be blacked out in the participating teams&#x27; markets to protect the local broadcaster.

<text>William Murray &quot;Trip&quot; Hawkins III (born December 28, 1953) is an American entrepreneur and founder of Electronic Arts, The 3DO Company, and Digital Chocolate.

==Career==

A fan of the Strat-O-Matic Football pen and paper games, Hawkins started his first business as a teenager trying to create a knockoff version. He borrowed $5,000 from his father to start up the venture and advertised his game in NFL Game Programs, but the business failed. Eventually, he received his first computer and became interested in creating a digital football game, because it would allow players to avoid the challenging math of the game, which was all handled internally. 
He designed his own undergraduate major at Harvard University in Strategy and Applied Game Theory.

Around this time, in 1975, Hawkins estimated that it would take home computer saturation seven years to make a viable career out of game design. He was the Director of Strategy and Marketing at Apple Computer in 1982 when he left to found Electronic Arts (EA), a video game publisher. EA was successful for many years under his leadership. He has been credited with spearheading the games industry&#x27;s evolution from simple one-person creations to complex team projects during this time. One of his first big wins was to sign John Madden on as a spokesperson and a consultant to his company&#x27;s football game which would eventually lead to the popular &quot;Madden NFL&quot; series of video games.

At this point, Electronic Arts was a computer software company which did not want to deal with Nintendo&#x27;s strict licensing policies. He saw his opportunity when Sega released the Genesis. Not wanting to pay licensing fees, he hired a team to reverse engineer the system for his company to make unlicensed games on it. Hawkins eventually revealed his intentions to Sega, while offering a partnership to combat Nintendo telling them, &quot;You can sue, but we did the tech fair and square and have great lawyers. So make us an official licensee. And give us a reduced rate.&quot; Sega, anticipating that Hawkins would sell his research to other third-party companies, agreed and made them a partner.

Though he remained chair of the board, he transitioned from EA in 1991 to form 3DO, a video game console company. He resigned from the board of EA in July, 1994. Meanwhile, 3DO was formed in partnership with several other companies including EA. Upon its release in 1993, the 3DO was the most powerful video game console at the time. It launched at an expensive , compared to other major systems under $200. Sales were poor due to its exorbitant price and weak games that relied excessively on full-motion video sequences (which were state-of-the-art for the time) at the expense of gameplay. Hopes for the system were further damaged in 1994 with the arrival of the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn, both of which were more expensive than the 3DO but had more modern hardware and stronger first party support. While acknowledging the 3DO&#x27;s failure in the marketplace, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed Hawkins in their &quot;75 Most Important People in the Games Industry of 1995&quot;, calling him &quot;one of the game market&#x27;s visionaries&quot;.

In 1996, 3DO stopped developing the system and transitioned into a video game developer, making games for the PlayStation, PC, and other consoles. While remaining chairman and CEO of the company, Hawkins took on the additional role of creative director. Hawkins focused on branding and 6-to-9-month production timetables for games. As a result, quality and sales suffered. Hawkins had used cash reserves to bail out the failing company before, but declined to do so a final time. Due to poor sales of its titles, it went bankrupt in May 2003. The defunct company sold most of its intellectual property, including the &quot;Might and Magic&quot; franchise, to publisher Ubisoft, while Trip Hawkins retained ownership of the 3DO console hardware and software.

In late 2003, Hawkins launched a new video game development company called Digital Chocolate. The company focused on developing games for handheld devices. He stepped down from the CEO position at Digital Chocolate in May, 2012.

In 2012, Hawkins joined the board of directors of Israeli technology company Extreme Reality, which is working on developing motion control software that can read a person&#x27;s movement in 3D, but which only requires a 2D camera.

On March 20, 2013, Nativex, a mobile ad technology platform for games, announced Trip Hawkins as a senior advisor to their board of directors. Hawkins also joined the advisory board at Skillz, a mobile eSports platform, as a strategic advisor in December 2014.

His newest startup, If You Can Company, aims to foster social and emotional development in children, teaching compassion and anti-bullying lessons. Their first game, &quot;IF...&quot;, uses a free-to-play model and is meant for teachers and students in an educational environment.

Hawkins lives in Santa Barbara, California where he served from 2016 to 2019 as a professor of entrepreneurship and leadership at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

==Honors==
In 2005, Hawkins became the eighth person to be inducted into the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences Hall of Fame.

<doc id="666026" wikidata="Q1170100" url="?curid=666026" title="The Philadelphia Experiment (film)">
<text>The Philadelphia Experiment is a 1984 American science fiction film. It is directed by Stewart Raffill, stars Michael Paré, Bobby Di Cicco, Kene Holliday and Nancy Allen and is based on the urban legend of the Philadelphia Experiment. In 1943, United States Navy sailors David Herdeg (Paré) and Jim Parker (Di Cicco) are thrown forward in time to the year 1984 when a scientific experiment being performed aboard the USS &quot;Eldridge&quot; suffers a catastrophe. The film follows the two men as they attempt to survive the future and race against time to put an end to the experiment that now threatens the fate of the entire world.

The film was released on August 3, 1984 by New World Pictures, and received mixed reviews from critics, but was a box office failure, only earning $8,103,330 against a budget of $9 million.

==Plot==
In 1943, United States Navy sailors David Herdeg and Jim Parker serve aboard destroyer escort USS &quot;Eldridge&quot;, docked in Philadelphia. Doctor James Longstreet and his team conduct an experiment to render the ship invisible to radar, but a malfunction causes the ship to disappear. David and Jim&#x27;s attempts to stop the experiment fail and they jump overboard to escape.

They land during the night in a small town, which also disappears, leaving them marooned in a desert. Startled by the appearance of an unfamiliar aircraft (a helicopter), they flee and Jim is nearly electrocuted by an electric fence. Eventually, they find their way to a roadside diner. An energy discharge from Jim destroys two arcade games, forcing an altercation with the owner. Fleeing to the parking lot, they take a woman named Allison hostage and force her to drive them away. Confused by their surroundings, they are shocked when Allison tells them that the year is 1984. They are tracked and apprehended by the police. Jim, who is suffering increasingly severe seizures, is hospitalized before disappearing from his hospital bed in a flash of light. David and Allison then evade military police, who have arrived to take David into custody.

Learning that they are near Jim&#x27;s birthplace, Santa Paula, California, David decides to try to find his family. Jim&#x27;s wife Pamela, who is now a senior citizen, immediately recognizes David from 1943. She says that the &quot;Eldridge&quot; had reappeared minutes after disappearing. Jim had also returned and had been chastised and hospitalized after telling the truth about temporarily visiting 1984. David finds that he himself never returned. David sees an elderly Jim outside a window but Jim refuses to speak with him. As David and Allison leave, they see military police approaching and a high speed chase through Jim&#x27;s ranch ensues. The two manage to elude them when the pursuing vehicle crashes and burns. From the burning wreck, David salvages documents mentioning Longstreet. Recognizing that Longstreet had been involved with the Philadelphia experiment in 1943, David decides to find him. As they spend time together, David and Allison fall in love.

In 1984, Longstreet has attempted to use the same technologies that were used in the &quot;Eldridge&quot; experiment to create a shield as protection from an ICBM attack. When the equipment was tested, the shielded town disappeared into &quot;hyperspace&quot;. The scientists are unable to shut down the experiment, which has created a vortex that is drawing matter into it and causes extremely unstable and severe weather. Longstreet predicts that the vortex will continue to expand until the entire world is consumed. The scientists send a probe into the vortex and discover the &quot;Eldridge&quot; inside. They theorize that the two experiments have linked together with the generators on the &quot;Eldridge&quot; powering the vortex.

David captures an assistant at Longstreet&#x27;s home and forces the man to take them onto the base. Longstreet explains the situation to David and tells him that, according to surviving sailors from the &quot;Eldridge&quot;, the ship returned to Philadelphia in 1943 after David shut down the generator. Longstreet says that David must go through the vortex to the &quot;Eldridge&quot; and terminate the experiment or the vortex will destroy the Earth.

David is outfitted with a protective suit to allow him to shut down the experiment and catapulted into the vortex. He lands on the deck of the &quot;Eldridge&quot;, where he finds crew members badly injured. He hurries to the generator room and smashes arrays of vacuum tubes using a firefighting axe. The generator shuts down and David looks for Jim. Assured that Jim is fine, David jumps over the side of the ship and disappears. Back in 1943, Longstreet and others watch the &quot;Eldridge&quot; reappear in Philadelphia, revealing crew members with severe burns, while others have been fused alive into the ship&#x27;s hull.

In 1984, the missing town reappears as Allison and David are reunited.

==Production==
===Development and writing===
John Carpenter wrote an original draft. He called it a &quot;great shaggy dog story. Absolute crap, but what a great story. While I was writing it, I couldn’t figure out the third act. A friend suggested the revenge of the crew against the people who put them there, but I thought it was too much like &quot;The Fog&quot;&quot;.
Stewart Raffill says by the time he became involved with the film, the script had been rewritten nine times. He agreed to do the film, subject to the next rewrite which he thought was &quot;terrible&quot;. The head of the studio agreed with Raffill&#x27;s additions to the script, even though it was only three weeks before filming: &quot;So, he asked if I had ever dictated a screenplay before. I told him I had not. Then he said, ‘Well, I’m gonna send someone to your house, a girl, every afternoon, and just dictate the story you told me and fill in the dialogue and we’ll make that.’ And I said, ‘Okay.’ So that&#x27;s what I did.&quot;

Principal photography began on November 28, 1983. Parts of the film were shot in Salt Lake City and Wendover, Utah, Denver, Colorado, Santa Paula, California, and Charleston, South Carolina. The destroyer USS &quot;Laffey&quot; (DD-724), then on display at Patriots Point, represented USS &quot;Eldridge&quot; in the film. Other shooting locations included the John P. Grace Memorial Bridge, which was also known as the Cooper River Bridge in 1983, Charleston Harbor, the William Enston Home, Wendover Air Force Base, and the Bonneville Salt Flats.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 50% based on reviews from 10 critics.

===Accolades===
* 1985, Nancy Allen was nominated by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films for the Saturn Award for Best Actress.

<text>A spur is a metal tool designed to be worn in pairs on the heels of riding boots for the purpose of directing a horse or other animal to move forward or laterally while riding. It is usually used to refine the riding aids (commands) and to back up the natural aids (the leg, seat, hands, and voice). The spur is used in many equestrian disciplines. Most equestrian organizations have rules covering spur design and use, as well as penalties for using spurs in any manner that constitutes animal abuse.

==Etymology==
This very old word derives from Anglo-Saxon &quot;spura, spora&quot;, related to &quot;spornan, spurnan&quot;, to kick, &quot;spurn&quot;; cf. Medieval High German &quot;Sporn&quot;, modern German &quot;Sporn&quot;, Dutch &quot;spoor&quot;. The generalized sense of &quot;anything that urges on, stimulus&quot; is recorded in English from&quot; circa&quot; 1390.

==Design==

The parts of a spur include:
*The &quot;yoke&quot;, &quot;branch&quot;, or &quot;heel band&quot;, which wraps around the heel of the boot.
*The &quot;shank&quot; or &quot;neck&quot;, which extends from the back of the yoke and is the area that touches the horse. 
*The rowel, seen on some spurs, a revolving wheel or disk with radiating &quot;points&quot; at the end attached to the shank.

Spurs are usually held on by a leather or leather-like spur strap that goes over the arch of the foot and under the sole in front of the boot heel. Some western designs have a leather strap that goes only over the top, with a heel chain or a rubber &quot;tiedown&quot; instead of a strap under the boot. Also, some styles have no straps, where the heel band is simply very tight and slips on wedged between the sole and heel of the boot. Some spur designs have a slot for running the spur strap through, others have &quot;buttons&quot;, sometimes on the heel band itself and sometimes attached to the heel band by hinges that allow a strap with buttonholes to be attached.

When used in military ranks, senior officers, and officers of all ranks in cavalry and other formerly mounted units of some armies, wear a form of spur in certain orders of dress which is known as the box spur, having no spur strap, but a long metal prong opposite the neck, extending between the arms of the heel band, which is inserted into a specially fitted recess or &quot;box&quot; in the base of the boot heel. Due to the prong, such spurs can only be worn with appropriately equipped boots. This construction is shown in the photos of the swan neck and Waterford spurs below.

Spurs seen in western riding may also have small curved-up hooks on the shank in front of the rowel, called &quot;chap guards&quot;, that were originally used to prevent the rider&#x27;s chaps from interfering with the rowels of the spur. The shank angle from the yoke can vary from &quot;full&quot; to &quot;one half&quot; to &quot;one quarter&quot; to &quot;straight&quot;. Some cowboys also added small metal &quot;pajados,&quot; also known as &quot;jingo bobs&quot; or &quot;jingle bobs,&quot; near the rowel, to create a jingling sound whenever the foot moved. Rowels can vary in size and number of points.

In the history of veterinary science, the word &quot;rowel&quot; described a small disk of leather or other material that was used as a seton stitch.

==History==

The spur was used by the Celts during the La Tène period, which began in the 5th century BC, and is also mentioned by Xenophon (354 BC). Iron or bronze spurs were also used throughout the Roman Empire. The spur also existed in the medieval Arab world. Early spurs had a neck that ended in a point, called a prick, riveted to the heel band. Prick spurs had straight necks in the 11th century and bent ones in the 12th. The earliest form of the spur armed the heel with a single prick. In England, the rowel spur is shown upon the first seal of Henry III and on monuments of the 13th century, but it did not come into general use until the 14th century.

The spurs of medieval knights were gilt and those of squires were silvered. To &quot;win his spurs&quot; meant to gain knighthood, as gilded spurs were reckoned the badge of knighthood. In the rare cases of ceremonious degradation, the spurs were hacked from the disgraced knight&#x27;s heels with the cook&#x27;s chopper. After the Battle of the Golden Spurs in 1302, where the French cavalry suffered a humbling defeat, the victors hung up bushels of knights&#x27; gilt spurs in the churches of Kortrijk as trophies of what is still remembered by the Flemings as the &quot;Guldensporenslag&quot; (the battle of the golden spurs). The English named the French rout from Thérouanne as the Battle of the Spurs, due to the rapidity of the French cavalry&#x27;s flight.

Prick spurs were the standard form until the 14th century, when the rowel began to become more common. The prick design never died out entirely, but instead became a thicker, shorter neck with a dulled end, such as the modern &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; design commonly seen in English riding.
Though often decorated throughout history, in the 15th century, spurs became an art form in both decoration and design, with elaborate engraving, very long shanks, and large rowels. Though sometimes it has been claimed that the design changes were used because of barding, the use of barding had fallen out of fashion by the time the most elaborate spur designs were created. More likely, the elaborate designs reflected the increased abundance of precious metals, particularly silver, that followed the European exploration of the Americas that began in 1492. Spur designs in Spain and colonial Mexico were particularly elaborate. For example, the spurs of the Spanish &quot;conquistadores&quot; were sometimes called &quot;espuela grande,&quot; the &quot;grand spur&quot;, and could have rowels as large as around.

In northern Europe, the spur became less elaborate after the 16th century, particularly following the Stuart Restoration, but elaborate spur designs persisted, particularly in the Americas, descendants of which are still seen today, particularly in Mexico and the western United States, where the spur has become an integral part of the &quot;vaquero&quot; and cowboy traditions. The spur as an art form, as well as a tool, is still seen in western riding, where spurs with engraving and other artistic elements, often handmade and using silver or other precious metals, are still worn.

Collecting of particularly beautiful antique spurs is a popular pastime for some individuals, particularly aficionados of western history and cowboy culture.

===Spurs as modern honours===
Just as a medieval knight was said to have &quot;earned his spurs&quot;, the awarding of spurs has continued in the modern era as an honour bestowed upon individuals in organizations with military heritages, and among motorcycle riders. Members of the Papal Orders of Knighthood receive gilt spurs direct from the hands of the pope; members of the British Order of the Garter similarly receive gilt spurs from the monarch. Inductees into the American Order of the Spur receive gold-coloured (usually brass) spurs if they have earned their membership through combat, or silver-coloured (usually nickel) spurs if they have not seen combat, but complete a rite of passage.

==Basic designs and wear==
Spurs are worn with the tip of the neck pointed downward, sitting on the spur rest of the riding boot, if there is one, with the buckle of the spur strap worn on the outside of the foot.

Spur styles differ between disciplines. Spurs for western riding tend to be heavier, often decorated, and have rowels that rotate. The neck of western spurs is usually longer and the rowel wide in diameter, to accommodate the leg position of the western-style rider, where the stirrup is adjusted long, and the heavy leather used for the saddle&#x27;s fenders and stirrups places the rider&#x27;s leg a bit farther from the horse.
Spurs in English riding tend to be very sleek, slim, and conservative in design, with a shorter neck, as the saddle and leg position are closer to the horse. They usually have a rounded or blunt end. Rowels are not as popular as the plain blunt end, although some types include a rowel or smooth disk on the end. When used in sports requiring finesse, such as dressage, the spur&#x27;s purpose is not to speed up the horse but to give accurate and precise aids in lateral and complex movements such as pirouettes, &quot;travers&quot;, and &quot;renvers&quot;, and the airs above the ground. Dressage riders tend to ride in Waterford-style spurs with a rounded knob at the end. Conversely, show hunter and jumper riders may use a flatter end to encourage forward movement, such as the Prince of Wales design.
Another type of modern spur is those used on motorcycles. They are characterized by rowels worn as foot jewelry, hung off of boots. They can be similar in appearance to spurs worn by equestrians. Their bright material attracts motor vehicle drivers to the presence of motorcyclists, especially to their feet where riders are most vulnerable when stopped in traffic. Their owners may further customize them by adding miniature strobing LED lights. They are also awarded by motorcycle clubs.

==Equestrian use==
The spur is a refined tool, designed to allow the rider to transmit very subtle signals to the horse that are nearly invisible to any other observer. No matter the discipline, it is important that a rider has a correct position before using spurs, with a deep seat, legs lengthened to the extent allowed by the stirrups, heels down, with knees and thighs rolled in so that the rider has a solid base of support. A swinging or unstable leg may inadvertently jab the horse with the spur as the rider sits, thus irritating, harming, and frightening the horse, and chronic misuse may deaden it to the leg aids. Improper use may also provoke dangerous or undesirable behaviors such as bucking or bolting.

Spurs are rarely used in sports such as horse racing, where the rider&#x27;s leg is not significantly in contact with the horse.

Most spurs are activated by the rider flexing the heel slightly up and in. A roweled spur permits an additional type of action: a rider can roll the spur lightly against the side of the horse rather than being limited simply to pressing inward.

===Rodeo spurring===

The exception to the use of spurs in a subtle fashion is in the rodeo events of bull riding and saddle bronc and bareback riding, where the rider is required to spur in an elaborate, stylized fashion, touching the horse or bull at every stride. This requirement is designed to resemble the behavior of old-time horse-breakers, who would deliberately provoke a horse to buck. In modern times, riders are required to use spurs in a manner that is merely encouraging a horse that is already predisposed to buck; they are not to produce pain. Spur design and use is strictly defined by rodeo rules, spurs are dull, and rowels must turn freely. In fact, the way spurs are to be used in bucking events generally makes it harder for the rider to stay on; in bareback bronc competition, the spurs must be above the point of the horse&#x27;s shoulder at the first jump and remain forward at all times, deliberately creating a very awkward position for the rider that requires both strength and coordination to stay on the horse. In saddle-bronc competition, the rider must make a full sweep with the spurs from shoulder to flank with each jump, requiring great concentration, and any error in balance puts the rider in a position to be quickly unseated. Bull riders are allowed a position that is the closest to that of classic riding, they are not required to spur the bull, but if they choose to spur, may do so with their legs down in a style that resembles a normal riding position.

==Types==


Spurs are divided into men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s, and children&#x27;s, according to width (which must fit on the heel of the rider&#x27;s boot). Spurs are further divided according to the length of the neck, with being relatively small (and a common size in children&#x27;s spurs), with some being long. Many competition rules limit the length of the neck.

* Round end: The end is a metal ball about the size of a small marble, making it one of the milder spurs.
* Knob end: The end of the spur is squared off, but blunted at the edges.
* Prince of Wales: This style has a flat end, making it slightly sharper. It is a popular spur style.
* Rowelled spur: The end of the spur has a toothed wheel which spins. This is the most common western-style spur, although it is seen on some English-style spurs. Teeth are dulled at the points. A rowel with many small teeth is milder than one with only a few, larger teeth. Most rowels have at least eight teeth on each wheel. Other variations, more common in English riding, include:
** Disc: The end has a small rowel-like rolling disc without teeth, which allows the spur to roll on the horse&#x27;s side when applied, decreasing chance of spur marks. Popular in dressage, its severity depends on the thickness of the disc.
**Roller spur: The end of the neck has a plastic &quot;roller,&quot; which moves as the horse&#x27;s side is touched. This spur tends to reduce spur-rubs on sensitive horses. It is considered very mild.
* Swan neck: The neck of the spur goes upward at an angle, before leveling off, looking similar to the neck of a swan. This is commonly seen in dressage.
* Waterford: The end of the neck has a large, round, metal ball, making the spur softer and less likely to cause spur rubs.
*&quot; Le spur&quot; (English) or barrel-racing spur (western): The spur has small &quot;teeth&quot; or ridges on the inside of the heel band, instead of a neck. For use, the rider does not have to turn in the heel. A quicker and more subtle design, it is also more apt to be accidentally used when not intended.
* Half-mounted: The spur is decorated on one side only with silver, copper, or bronze decals, logos, or coverings.
* Full-mounted or double-mounted: The spur is decorated on both sides (in and out) with precious metals, images, and designs.

<doc id="666041" wikidata="Q588300" url="?curid=666041" title="New England's Dark Day">
<text>New England&#x27;s Dark Day occurred on May 19, 1780, when an unusual darkening of the daytime sky was observed over the New England states and parts of eastern Canada. The primary cause of the event is believed to have been a combination of smoke from forest fires, a thick fog, and cloud cover. The darkness was so complete that candles were required from noon on. It did not disperse until the middle of the next night.

==Range of the darkness==
According to Professor Samuel Williams of Harvard College, the darkness was seen at least as far north as Portland, Maine, and extended southwards to New Jersey. The darkness was not witnessed in Pennsylvania.

Revolutionary War soldier Joseph Plumb Martin noted:
We were here [New Jersey] at the time the &quot;dark day&quot; happened, (19th of May;) it has been said that the darkness was not so great in New-Jersey as in New-England. How great it was there I do not know, but I know that it was very dark where I then was in New-Jersey; so much so that the fowls went to their roosts, the cocks crew and the whip-poor-wills sung their usual serenade; the people had to light candles in their houses to enable them to see to carry on their usual business; the night was as uncommonly dark as the day was.

==Progress==
The earliest report of the darkness came from Rupert, Vermont, where the sun was already obscured at sunrise. Professor Samuel Williams observed from Cambridge, Massachusetts, &quot;This extraordinary darkness came on between the hours of 10 and 11 a.m. and continued till the middle of the next night.&quot; Reverend Ebenezer Parkham of Westborough, Massachusetts, reported peak obscurity to occur &quot;by 12&quot;, but did not record the time when it first arrived. At Harvard College, the obscuration was reported to arrive at 10:30 a.m., peaking at 12:45 p.m. and abating by 1:10 p.m., but a heavy overcast remained for the rest of the day. The obscuration was reported to have reached Barnstable, Massachusetts, by 2:00 p.m., with peak obscurity reported to have occurred at 5:30 p.m.

Roosters crowed, woodcocks whistled, and frogs peeped as if night had fallen at 2:00 p.m. in Ipswich, Massachusetts. A witness reported that a strong sooty smell prevailed in the atmosphere, and that rain water had a light film over it that was made up of particles of burnt leaves and ash. Contemporaneous reports also indicated that ash and cinders fell on parts of New Hampshire to a depth of .

==Other atmospheric phenomena==
For several days before the Dark Day, the sun as viewed from New England appeared to be red, and the sky appeared yellow. While the darkness was present, soot was observed to have collected in rivers and in rain water, suggesting the presence of smoke. Also, when the night really came in, observers saw the moon colored red. For portions of New England, the morning of May 19, 1780, was characterized by rain, indicating that cloud cover was present.

==Religious interpretations==
Most people found the darkness to be baffling and inexplicable. Many applied religious interpretations to the event.

In Connecticut, a member of the Governor&#x27;s council (renamed the Connecticut State Senate in 1818), Abraham Davenport, became most famous for his response to his colleagues&#x27; fears that it was the Day of Judgment:

I am against adjournment. The day of judgment is either approaching, or it is not. If it is not, there is no cause for an adjournment; if it is, I choose to be found doing my duty. I wish therefore that candles may be brought.

Davenport&#x27;s courage was commemorated in the poem &quot;&quot; by John Greenleaf Whittier. Edwin Markham also commemorated the event in his poem &quot;A Judgement Hour&quot;, found in &quot;The Gates of Paradise and Other Poems&quot;.

Seventh-day Adventist author and editor Arthur S. Maxwell mentions this event in his &quot;The Bible Story&quot; series (volume 10). The significance of the incident is still debated among Adventist scholars today. Progressive Adventists do not necessarily interpret this as a sign that Jesus would soon return, but traditional historic and conservative Adventists who hold Ellen G. White&#x27;s writings in higher regard still consider this date as one of the fulfillments of biblical prophecy, specifically Matthew 24:29, in which Jesus declares to his disciples, &quot;Immediately after the distress of those days [of anti-Christian persecution,] the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light...&quot; (NIV).

Similarly, the Public Universal Friend treated the event as fulfillment of some prophecies of the Book of Revelation. The Dark Day also provided motivation for Ann Lee, leader of the Shakers (then living in Niskayuna, New York), to present her religious testimony to the public.

==Cause==
The likely cause of the Dark Day was smoke from extensive forest fires, for which there is evidence from the time of the Dark Day. When a fire does not kill a tree and the tree later grows, scar marks are left in the growth rings. This makes it possible to approximate the date of a past fire. Researchers examining tree rings and fire scars in trees in the area that is today occupied by Algonquin Provincial Park in Ontario, Canada, see evidence of a fire in 1780 and attribute the Dark Day to that.

<doc id="666053" wikidata="Q435971" url="?curid=666053" title="John Alcock (RAF officer)">
<text>Captain Sir John William Alcock (5 November 189219 December 1919) was a British Royal Navy and later Royal Air Force officer who, with navigator Lieutenant Arthur Whitten Brown, piloted the first non-stop transatlantic flight from St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland to Clifden, Ireland in June 1919. He died in a flying accident in France in December later that same year.

==Early life==
John Alcock was born on 5 November 1892, perhaps in the coach-house adjoining Basford House on Seymour Grove, Firswood, Manchester, England.

His family lived for eight years in Lytham. He attended Heyhouses School in Lytham St. Annes, from 24 April 1900 to 5 April 1905.

His father worked for Sir Edward Hulton&#x27;s Press. His family moved to 6 Kingswood Road in Ladybarn, Fallowfield.His father died on 14 January 1943.

His brother ESJ Alcock, who attended Manchester Grammar School, became the chief flying instructor of BOAC, in the late 1940s, and had learned to fly with his brother, and later lived at Lytham St Annes. Albert, another brother, later lived in Prestwich.

He first became interested in flying at the age of 17. His first job was at the Empress Motor Works in Manchester. In 1910 he became an assistant to Works Manager Charles Fletcher, an early Manchester aviator and Norman Crossland, a motor engineer and founder of Manchester Aero Club. It was during this period that Alcock met the Frenchman Maurice Ducrocq who was both a demonstration pilot and UK sales representative for aero engines made by the Italian Spirito Mario Viale.

Ducrocq took Alcock on as a mechanic at the Brooklands aerodrome, Surrey, where he learned to fly at Ducrocq&#x27;s flying school, gaining his pilot&#x27;s licence there in November 1912. Alcock then joined the Sunbeam Motor Car Company as a racing pilot. By summer 1914 he was proficient enough to compete in a Hendon-Birmingham-Manchester and return air race, flying a Farman biplane. He landed at Trafford Park Aerodrome and flew back to Hendon the same day.

==Military career==
At the beginning of World War I, Alcock joined the Royal Naval Air Service as a warrant-officer instructor at the Royal Naval Flying School at Eastchurch in Kent. It was whilst at Eastchurch that Alcock received his commission as a flight sub-lieutenant in December 1915. In 1916 he was transferred to a squadron operating at Moudros, on the Greek island of Lemnos. While stationed at Moudros he conceived and built the &quot;Alcock Scout&quot;, a fighter aircraft built out of the remnants of unused and abandoned aircraft.

On 30 September 1917, whilst piloting a Sopwith Camel, Alcock attacked three enemy aircraft, forcing two to crash into the sea. For this action he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. After returning to base he then piloted a Handley Page bomber on a strategic bombing raid targeting Constantinople. He was forced to turn back to base after an engine failed near Gallipoli. After flying on a single engine for more than 60 miles, that engine also failed and the aircraft ditched in the sea, near Suvla Bay. Alcock and his crew of two were unable to attract nearby British destroyers, and when the plane finally began to sink they swam for an hour to reach the Ottoman Army-held shore. All three were taken prisoner next day by the Turkish forces. Alcock remained a prisoner of war until the Armistice and retired from the Royal Air Force in March 1919.

==First non-stop flight across the Atlantic==
After the war Alcock became a test pilot for Vickers and took up the challenge of attempting to be the first to fly directly across the Atlantic. Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown took off from St John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, at 1:45 pm local time on 14 June 1919, and landed in Derrygimla bog near Clifden, Ireland, 16 hours and 12 minutes later on 15 June 1919 after flying . The flight had been much affected by bad weather, making accurate navigation difficult; the intrepid duo also had to cope with turbulence, instrument failure, and ice on the wings. The flight was made in a modified Vickers Vimy bomber and won a £10,000 prize (£ in 2025) offered by London&#x27;s &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newspaper for the first non-stop flight across the Atlantic.

A few days after the flight both Alcock and Brown were honoured with a reception at Windsor Castle during which King George V invested them with their insignia as Knights Commanders of the Order of the British Empire.

Alcock was present at the Science Museum in London on 15 December 1919 when the recovered Vimy aircraft was presented to the nation.

==Death==
On 18 December 1919, Alcock was piloting a new Vickers amphibious aircraft, the Vickers Viking, to the first post-war aeronautical exhibition in Paris when he crashed in fog at Cottévrard, near Rouen in Normandy. Alcock suffered a fractured skull and never regained consciousness after being transferred to a hospital in Rouen. He succumbed to his injuries the following day.

His grave in Southern Cemetery, Manchester is marked by a large stone memorial.

<text>The Oakland Tribune was a daily newspaper published in Oakland, California, and a predecessor of the &quot;East Bay Times&quot;. It was published by the Bay Area News Group (BANG), a subsidiary of MediaNews Group. Founded in 1874, the &quot;Tribune&quot; rose to become an influential daily newspaper. With the decline of print media, in 2016, the paper announced that the &quot;Tribune&quot;, along with its owner&#x27;s other newspapers in the East Bay, would be folded into a new newspaper titled the &quot;East Bay Times&quot; starting April 5, 2016. The former nameplates of the consolidated newspapers will continue to be published every Friday as weekly community supplements.

==Origin==
The &quot;Tribune&quot; was founded February 21, 1874, by George Staniford and Benet A. Dewes. The &quot;Oakland Daily Tribune&quot; was first printed at 468 Ninth St. as a 4-page, 3-column newspaper, 6 by 10 inches. Staniford and Dewes gave out copies free of charge. The paper had news stories and 43 advertisements.

Staniford, the editor and Dewes, the printer, were credited with producing a paper with fine typographical look and editorial nature. The competition was the &quot;Oakland News&quot; and &quot;Oakland Transcript&quot;. The first editorial stated, &quot;There seems to be an open field for a journal like the &quot;Tribune&quot; in Oakland, and we accordingly proceed to occupy it, presenting the &quot;Tribune&quot;, which is intended to be a permanent daily paper, deriving its support solely from advertising patronage.&quot;

Later that year, Staniford sold his half interest to Dewes; then, Dewes sold a half interest to A.B. Gibson. The &quot;Tribune&quot; moved, January 30, 1875, to 911 Broadway and Gibson sold his half interest to the paper to A. E. Nightingill. In 1876, Dewes and Nightingill, found a buyer for the &quot;Tribune&quot;.

==The William Dargie era==

The &quot;Tribune&quot; became a major paper under William E. Dargie (1854–1911), who acquired the paper July 24, 1876. &quot;The Tribune Publishing Company&quot;, was created with William Edward Dargie as Manager and (Albion Keith Paris) A. K. P. Harmon, Jr., Secretary.

The &quot;Tribune&quot; was a solid Republican newspaper under Dargie and (later) the Knowlands. Dargie was a news innovator in several ways: 1876, wire service dispatches; 1877, a book and job department added; 1878, when the Bell Telephone System arrived in Oakland, one of the first telephones was installed at the &quot;Tribune&quot;- Number 46; 1883, a Saturday edition was introduced; 1887, special editions; 1888, an extra for the presidential election.

On August 28, 1891, the name &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; was officially adopted. Prior names include &quot;Oakland Daily Tribune&quot;, the &quot;Oakland Evening Tribune&quot; and the &quot;Oakland Daily Evening Tribune&quot;. Dargie had news offices in New York and Chicago. Dargie also acquired a patent approved R. Hoe &amp; Co. double cylinder press.

The &quot;Tribune&quot; was a charter member of the Associated Press upon its founding in 1900.

Among Dargie&#x27;s hires, at the turn of the century, was Jack Gunin, a one-eyed lensman, the first full-time photojournalist in the Western United States.

In 1906, the &quot;Tribune&quot; added a Sunday edition.

===1906 earthquake===

The newspapers of San Francisco were destroyed in the earthquake and fire of April 18, 1906. The &quot;Tribune&quot; printed many &quot;extras.&quot; Dargie lent the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s presses for a joint edition of the &quot;San Francisco Call-Chronicle-Examiner&quot;. In the aftermath of the conflagration, San Francisco Mayor Eugene E. Schmitz, declared the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; the official San Francisco newspaper.

The circulation grew as displaced San Franciscans moved to Oakland and Alameda County. The &quot;Tribune&quot;″s editorial direction was then under Managing Editor John Conners. After 35 years as publisher, William E. Dargie died on February 10, 1911. Former Oakland Mayor Melvin C. Chapman served as acting president of the Tribune Publishing Company. Bruno Albert Forsterer (1869–1957), was publisher and general manager. He was executor of Dargie&#x27;s estate. Bruno and his son, Harold B. Forsterer, also served the Knowlands and the &quot;Tribune&quot;.

==The Knowland Family era==

After five terms in the United States House of Representatives, Joseph R. Knowland (1873–1966) purchased the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; from Dargie&#x27;s widow, Hermina Peralta Dargie. In his first edition as publisher of the Oakland Tribune, November 14, 1915, he wrote, &quot;It is perfectly understood that what the &quot;Tribune&quot; does, rather than what it promises, will determine the true measure of its worth; and with that understanding, the &quot;Tribune&quot;, under its new control, girds to its work.&quot;

Knowland moved the &quot;Tribune&quot; to a new location at 13th and Franklin Streets on March 25, 1918. Under Knowland, the &quot;Tribune&quot; became one-third of a triumvirate of California Republican newspapers with conservative viewpoints, along with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. The &quot;Tribune&quot; endorsed Republican candidates and &quot;J.R.&quot; (as Knowland was widely known) often picked and controlled Republican elected officials. The Tribune would make many political careers, the most noted being Knowland&#x27;s own son William F. Knowland and Earl Warren.

In 1921, Knowland started radio station KLX and his newspaper library. The 305 feet tall Tribune Tower, an Oakland landmark, was completed in 1923. The Tribune moved its business into the tower in 1924. &quot;The Tribune Publishing Corporation&quot;, was founded by Knowland on January 4, 1928. The publishing corporation held interests in KLX, part owner of a paper mill in Tacoma, Washington and subsidiary businesses, U-Bild, Tower Graphics and Tribune Features, Inc.

In the mid-1930s, J.R. tied in with the Associated Press Wirephoto Service. He had a direct wire link for international news from London, England. The mast head logo, which became an icon of the paper, showed Oakland, a port to the world and nation. The logo changed with the times: the Tower, transport ship and steam locomotive; in later years, the Tower, the Bay Bridge, larger transport ship, diesel engine, the china clipper and later, a jet airplane.

On September 1, 1950, the &quot;Tribune&quot; became the sole Oakland daily newspaper, with the demise of its competitor, William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s &quot;Oakland Post Enquirer&quot;.

In 1960, Joseph R. Knowland&#x27;s son, former U.S. Senator William F. Knowland (1908–1974), was named editor; he had shared being assistant publisher with his brother, Joseph Russell &quot;Russ&quot; Knowland, Jr. (1901–1961), since 1933. Russ Knowland&#x27;s 1961 death made his brother Bill sole successor to their father.

On February 1, 1966, Joseph R. Knowland died at the age of 92. William F. Knowland was appointed president and publisher. His son, Joseph William Knowland became vice-president and general manager. Bill Knowland added to the logo, &quot;A Responsible Metropolitan Newspaper&quot;. The Senator had assumed duties as the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s publisher and editor. He became the president of &quot;The Tribune Publishing Corporation&quot;.

Under Bill Knowland&#x27;s ownership, the &quot;Tribune&quot; had a conservative editorial position and a reputation for being strongly pro-business. As the city of Oakland became more ethnically and politically diverse in the 1960s and 1970s, the Tribune was unable to respond quickly enough to the demographic changes (and the political and social unrest exemplified, among other factors, by the University of California, Berkeley, student uprisings and the Black Panther movement).

The &quot;Tribune&quot;″s readership declined after the early 1960s as a large portion of the paper&#x27;s traditional subscription base relocated to the newly developing suburbs south and east of Oakland. In southern Alameda County, the readership went to Floyd Sparks&#x27;s &quot;The (Hayward) Daily Review&quot; and in Contra Costa County to Dean Lesher&#x27;s &quot;Contra Costa Times&quot;.

In 1973, Bill Knowland wrote in Fortune magazine, &quot;Any city needs a means of communication between the diverse members of its community. Communication is essential.&quot;

Bill Knowland&#x27;s personal life would soon affect the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot;. Two days after the &quot;Tribune&quot; celebrated its 100th anniversary on February 21, 1974, William F. Knowland committed suicide. On the death of their father, Joseph William Knowland (1930-2019), became the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s editor and publisher; Emelyn K. Jewett (1929–1988) became president of &quot;The Tribune Publishing Corporation&quot;.

The California Press Association honored Joseph W. Knowland, as the winner of the 1975, &quot;Publisher of the Year&quot; award. This honor was bestowed on Joe Knowland for his progressive innovations in the operations and makeup of the newspaper.

==End of the Knowland Era: CCC and Gannett==

In 1977, the Knowland Family sold the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; to Combined Communications Corporation, owned by Arizona-based outdoor sign mogul Karl Eller. &quot;The Tribune Publishing Corporation&quot;, was dissolved by the Knowland Family. Eller had recently acquired &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;. In 1979, CCC merged with the East Coast-based media conglomerate Gannett Company, and the &quot;Tribune&quot; was thus acquired by Gannett Company. That year, Allen H. Neuharth, Gannett CEO, used the &quot;Tribune&quot; as a pilot project with a new morning paper called &quot;East Bay Today&quot;, which served as an early prototype of Gannett&#x27;s later national paper &quot;USA Today&quot;. In 1979, Gannett named Robert C. Maynard (1937–1993) editor, becoming the first African-American editor in the paper&#x27;s history. In 1983, Maynard—who by this time had become publisher and with Gannett&#x27;s blessing—consolidated the &quot;Tribune&quot; and &quot;East Bay Today&quot; into a single morning newspaper under the &quot;Tribune&quot; name.

==The Maynard era==

In 1983, Maynard and his wife, Nancy Hicks Maynard, purchased the &quot;Tribune&quot; from Gannett for $17 million (financed by a loan from Gannett) in the first management-led leveraged buyout in U.S. newspaper history. It was also historic for the &quot;Tribune&quot; becoming the first major metropolitan daily newspaper owned by an African-American. This was seen as especially notable as Oakland was developing a relatively large African-American community which, by the 1980s, was becoming increasingly influential in local business and politics. Maynard helped restore the paper&#x27;s reputation, earning a Pulitzer Prize in 1990.

But for all of its editorial kudos under Maynard, the &quot;Tribune&quot; still was plagued by financial difficulties beyond Maynard&#x27;s control. Facing a debt of $31.5 million and on the brink of folding in August 1991, the &quot;Tribune&quot; was saved by the Freedom Forum, Allen H. Neuharth&#x27;s media foundation. The Freedom Forum paid Gannett $2.5 million, retired the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s debt and gave Maynard $5 million in operating funds. But the rescue proved to be short-lived, and the continuing financial pressures—combined with the disclosure in July 1992 that Robert Maynard had been diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer—forced the Maynards to put the &quot;Tribune&quot; up for sale.

The Tribune Tower was severely damaged in the Loma Prieta earthquake of October 17, 1989, yet the paper continued to publish there until ANG moved it to a building located at Oakland&#x27;s Jack London Square at the edge of San Francisco Bay. The Tower sat empty until 1995, when John Protopappas purchased it for $300,000. His company, Madison Park Financial Corporation, renovated the Tower in the late 1990s. The &quot;Tribune&quot; returned to the Tower after it reopened in 1999.

==ANG and InsideBayArea.com==
On October 15, 1992, the Alameda Newspaper Group (Now the Bay Area News Group), a division of MediaNews Group that published several competing suburban community newspapers, agreed to buy the &quot;Tribune&quot; for $10 million from the Maynards. The final issue of the &quot;Tribune&quot; under the Maynards rolled off the Tribune Tower&#x27;s presses on November 30, 1992; and the first issue under ANG&#x27;s ownership was printed at the company&#x27;s Hayward plant the following day. As a result, the &quot;Tribune&quot; was no longer considered the dominant East Bay newspaper.

The group&#x27;s entry into the computer age was first discussed at the 1983 International Typographical Union convention; newspaper internet websites came of age in the mid- and late-1990s. The &quot;ANG&quot; official website was &quot;InsideBayArea.com&quot; for the online &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot;; the website was shared with other ANG/MediaNews newspapers.

On May 20, 2007, the &quot;Tribune&quot; moved permanently from the Tribune Tower to new offices on Oakport Street, across Interstate 880 from the Oakland Coliseum. The Tribune Tower, a local and national landmark, remains, now housing several businesses and a ground-floor cafe.

On August 2, 2007, &quot;Oakland Post&quot; editor and former (1993–2005) Tribune journalist Chauncey Bailey was murdered in a targeted hit on his way to work. This led the &quot;Tribune&quot; to start &quot;The Chauncey Bailey Project&quot;, a series of articles focusing on the causes and aftermaths of the murder.

In 2011, BANG announced a plan to merge the &quot;Tribune&quot; with other sister East Bay newspapers, but on October 27, 2011, BANG announced that it would retain &quot;The Oakland Tribune&quot; masthead.

On August 30, 2012, the &quot;Tribune&quot; moved its offices to 1970 Broadway in Oakland&#x27;s Uptown district.

The last daily edition of the &quot;Tribune&quot; was published on April 4, 2016, as it was combined with other BANG-owned East Bay papers the &quot;Contra Costa Times&quot;, &quot;Hayward Daily Review&quot; and &quot;Fremont Argus, The Alameda Journal&quot; under the new &quot;East Bay Times&quot; nameplate.
==Pulitzer Prizes==

The &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; won the Pulitzer Prize for a photograph of a small private plane narrowly missing a B-29 Superfortress in 1950, and again for photographs of the aftermath of the October 17, 1989, Loma Prieta earthquake.

<doc id="666068" wikidata="Q1898394" url="?curid=666068" title="Nouveau riche">
<text>; ), new rich, or new money (in contrast to old money; ) is a social class of the rich whose wealth has been acquired within their own generation, rather than by familial inheritance. These people previously had belonged to a lower social class and economic stratum (rank) within that class and the term implies that the new money, which constitutes their wealth, allowed upward social mobility and provided the means for conspicuous consumption, the buying of goods and services that signal membership in an upper class. As a pejorative term, &quot;nouveau riche&quot; affects distinctions of type, the given stratum within a social class; hence, among the rich people of a social class, &quot;nouveau riche&quot; describes the vulgarity and ostentation of the newly rich person who lacks the worldly experience and the system of values of &quot;old money&quot;, of inherited wealth, such as the patriciate, the nobility, and the gentry.

==History==

The idea of &quot;nouveau riche&quot; dates at least as far back as ancient Greece (). In the 6th century BCE, the poet and aristocrat Theognis of Megara wrote how &quot;in former days, there was a tribe who knew no laws nor manners ... These men are nobles, now, the gentlemen of old are now the trash&quot;. In the Roman Republic, the term &quot;novus homo&quot; (&#x27;new man&#x27;) carried similar connotations.

==Social status==
One can define social status in relation to wealth and to the power granted by the wealth. It has been argued that the upper, ruling classes have legitimized &quot;... their rule with claims of status and honor and moral superiority&quot;. Ruling classes make claims in defense of the ascribed superiority of wealth inherited through &quot;blood ... and the concept of proper breeding&quot;. The &quot;nouveau riche&quot; are juxtaposed against the old-money social class of those with trans-generational, inherited wealth in order to highlight the cultural, value system and societal differences between the two social groups.

Old Family ties, as traditional claims of status, are not found in the &quot;nouveaux riches&quot;, which challenges and ultimately redefines social traditions and values such as the institution of debutantes and their debut to society. As seen through the rise in the number of debutantes, the social value of the debut has since shifted from the &quot;family&#x27;s elite social standing and long family traditions&quot; to &quot;a symbolic value as an element of upper-class life style&quot;. This transition allows for high social standing to be established by the &quot;nouveau riche&quot; through the institution of the debut. Social integration of these elite sects is extremely slow and sluggish, which prolongs and strengthens stereotypes. This rate of integration makes it more likely that the &quot;nouveaux riches&quot; will &quot;retain identification with the traditional ... group of origin; this is the basis for division between the groups. Furthermore, the isolation that minority &quot;nouveaux riches&quot; experience within their own class leads them &quot;to prioritize issues of radical justice, civil liberties, and religious tolerance over pure economic self-interest&quot;.

==Inter-class stereotypes==
Often referred to as &quot;parvenu&quot;, members of the &quot;nouveau riche&quot; are often discriminated against by the old-money sects of society since they &quot;lack the proper pedigree&quot;. These newcomers to economic power are subject to even greater scrutiny from their lack of historical prestige as seen through Dye&#x27;s comments which reference the new rich as &quot;uncouth&quot; and &quot;uncultured&quot;. The behavior of the &quot;nouveau riche&quot; is often satirized by American society by &quot;implying that stereotyped, rather than real, behavior patterns are copied&quot;.

Many people have made claims to the inferiority of those with new money as compared to those with old money. Many have made claims that &quot;nouveaux riches&quot; &quot;lack political and cultural sophistication&quot; and others make comparisons saying that the old rich are &quot;more sophisticated than the less cosmopolitan nouveau riche&quot;. These assumptions further perpetuate the differences between the two and lead to even further stereotypes and have lasted for well over a century. In 1929, Mrs. Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte, who herself married into a family that had once been considered &quot;parvenu&quot; and lacking in pedigree, protested that &quot;the &quot;nouveau riche&quot;... is making places like Palm Beach no more exclusive than Coney Island. Newport, the last stronghold of the elite, has the moneyed intruder at the gates... Undesirables are penetrating everywhere&quot;. In 18th-century Europe, old-money families attempted to raise themselves above the &quot;nouveaux riches&quot; by sensitively renovating their ancestral residences to allude to their antiquity. Their evident ties to the families&#x27; history could not be rivaled by the new, self-made, class. In the Dutch Republic, the nobility sought this as an advantage over the merchant burghers of Amsterdam and a similar trend arose in the French court. The same is true of the fashionable lairds of 17th-century Scotland who re-worked buildings like Thirlestane Castle, Glamis Castle and Drumlanrig Castle to celebrate the lineage of their families.

== &quot;Nouveau pauvre&quot; ==
The term was coined to refer to a person who had once owned wealth but has now lost all or most of it. This term is generally used to emphasize that the individual was previously part of a higher socioeconomic rank and that such wealth that provided the means for the acquisition of goods or luxuries is currently unobtainable. These people may or may not actually be poor, but compared to their previous rank, it seems as if they are. Nicholas Monson (grandson of the 9th Baron Monson) and Debra Scott were authors of &quot;The Nouveaux Pauvres: A Guide to Downward Nobility&quot; (1984), &quot;a lifestyle manual for poverty-stricken aristocrats&quot; &quot;running an aristocratic lifestyle on a tradesman&#x27;s budget&quot;.

<doc id="666076" wikidata="Q4969182" url="?curid=666076" title="Brit funk">
<text>Brit funk (or Britfunk) is a musical style that has its origins in the British music scene of the late 1970s and which remained popular into the 1980s. It mixes elements from jazz, funk, soul, urban dance rhythms and pop hooks. The scene originated in southern England and spread with support from DJs including DJ Froggy, Greg Edwards, Robbie Vincent, Chris Hill and Colin Curtis. Major funk acts included Jimmy James and the Vagabonds, Average White Band, Ian Dury &amp; the Blockheads, Carl Douglas, Hot Chocolate, the Delegation, Hi-Tension, Light of the World, Level 42, Central Line, the Pasadenas, Beggar and Co and Soul II Soul. The genre also influenced 1980s new wave/pop groups such as Culture Club, Bow Wow Wow, Pigbag, Dexys Midnight Runners and Haircut 100.

==Name and characteristics==
The term Brit funk evolved from the club DJs and James Hamilton of &quot;Record Mirror&quot; whose column had a major influence in launching new records. Brit funk was a fusion of R&amp;B, funk, soul music rhythms. Pioneers of this sound, groups Hi-Tension and Light of the World, had a British twist to their instrumentation and vocals, avoiding American accents. The emerging punk rock scene has also been cited as an influence by Brit funk musicians: Jean-Paul &#x27;Bluey&#x27; Maunick, guitarist with Light of the World and subsequently leader of Incognito, said that the energy of punk and a lack of musical experience led to his attempts to emulate the &quot;slick funk&quot; of 1970s American soul and jazz-funk acts turning into a sound &quot;somewhere between that and a guy that’s just thrashing a guitar&quot;, whilst John Rocca of Freeez - who were signed by punk label Beggars Banquet Records - also drew parallels between the two scenes. Hi-Tension co-founder Paul McLean has also suggested that the Caribbean roots of many Brit funk musicians also influenced their music, resulting in &quot;a looser rhythm (and) hints of reggae in the sound&quot;.

==History==
The British funk scene developed from the Home Counties, principally Essex at Lacy Lady in Ilford and The Goldmine on Canvey Island, along with clubs such as Crackers and the 100 Club on London&#x27;s Oxford Street, Royalty in the London suburb of Southgate and Frenchies in Camberley, Surrey. According to &#x27;Bluey&#x27; Maunick, the club scene attracted &quot;a real mix of Black kids and white kids getting on in a surrounding that they all enjoyed, where they could be themselves&quot;, helping to break down the racial barriers which he had grown up with. In the South DJ Chris Hill and his Funk Mafia were pioneers, and in the North Colin Curtis, among others, were instrumental in its growth in popularity. Although the scene enjoyed significant underground popularity – a 1980 all-day event at Knebworth featuring Light of the World attracted 12,000 people – it attracted little mainstream media attention outside of Robbie Vincent&#x27;s show on BBC Radio London: the BBC did produce &quot;Black Current&quot;, a TV pilot featuring Hi-Tension which was intended to launch a show conceived as a British equivalent of &quot;Soul Train&quot;, but this was not picked up for a full series.

Jimmy James &amp; the Vagabonds recorded Brit funk song &quot;Disco Fever&quot;. Princess gained UK hit &quot;Say I&#x27;m Your No.1&quot;. With support from the club disc jockeys and labels such as Ensign Records and Elite Records, 80s artists including Light of the World, Level 42 enjoyed chart success and made regular appearances on BBC&#x27;s flagship pop programme &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. The first hit was &quot;Hi Tension&quot; by Hi-Tension. The biggest hits in the genre were &quot;British Hustle&quot; by Hi-Tension (which reached number 8 in 1978) and &quot;Southern Freeez&quot; by Freeez (which reached number 8 in 1981). Light of the World split and members formed Beggar and Co and Incognito.

&quot;Hits in the US R&amp;B chart&quot; by black British artists included Carl Douglas, Delegation, Hot Chocolate, Jaki Graham, Central Line, Loose Ends, and Junior(Junior Giscombe). With DJs gaining cult status, the scene also created many &#x27;club hits&#x27; which never achieved commercial success. Many British based soul and dance bands found themselves merging under the Brit funk banner. These included Central Line and Second Image.

Another portion of the Brit funk scene emerged from the light entertainment circuit with a number of acts performing cabaret, working men&#x27;s clubs, and US army base venues during the early 1970s. Many of these Black British groups masqueraded as American acts, performing covers in the style of American performers. National exposure for these acts was sometimes achieved through television programmes such as &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; and &quot;New Faces&quot; as was the case for the Manchester group, Sweet Sensation. These programmes served as the gateway from the light entertainment scene into the British music industry.

Britfunk was an instrumental form of expression in developing Black British identity, particularly among young people. Author Robert Strachan explains the demographic as &quot;the generation of young black people who were the first to be born in the United Kingdom found their expression through the adaptation of emergent African-American music to a particularly British context&quot; (Strachan 69). Brit funk helped this generation of young people find their own unique sound and in doing so explore their own unique identities. While Brit funk drew heavy influence from American music, the young and diverse demographic spearheading the genre created a much more inclusive and fluid space. As a result, the music itself was much less worked than American funk and as Strachan describes found its &quot;stylistic variation through naivety&quot; (Strachan 68).

==Influence==
1980s pop groups such as Haircut 100 and Wham! tapped into the style and sound to help launch their careers. This scene was significant in reducing racial boundaries in the clubs and raised the profile of black and white musicians working together, notably Spandau Ballet who collaborated with Beggar and Co to produce the hit single &quot;Chant Number One&quot;. Following the song&#x27;s success Beggar and Co provided brass for other artists. According to Maunick, during Spandau Ballet&#x27;s early days they watched Light of the World&#x27;s rehearsals and asked them for musical advice. During the success of the jazz and Brit funk period, &quot;chanting&quot; became popular in discothèques and nightclubs. This football crowd style of interacting with the music continues in British clubs today. Hi-Tension&#x27;s Patrick McLean has said that their frequent use of chanting was influenced by the early 1970s glam rock which they had grown up with.

Inspired by soul, jazz, hip-hop and funk, Brit funk exploded onto the scene in the 1980s, one of the first times black artists (primarily of Caribbean descent) received mainstream success in the UK. Between 1980 and 1983, in particular, many Brit funk acts came into the scene. However, what separated these British artists from Americans is widely debated. Some theories include a unique British wit/humor, inspiration from Euro fashion, stripped down aesthetics, and accents. However, a popular theory is that Brit funk&#x27;s success in the British mainstream is due to its classification as pop music with lighter themes that are less concerned with the politics and identity found in reggae. Songs like Linx&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re Lying&quot; (1980), Beggar and Co&#x27;s &quot;Somebody Help Me Out&quot; (1981) and Central Line&#x27;s &quot;Walking into Sunshine&quot; (1981) appealed to those who wanted either relationship or sociopolitical commentary. Major labels&#x27; choices to market mostly love songs marked a larger gender divide. It was incredibly rare to find female musicians; however, female vocalists were often essential to the integration of &quot;soul&quot; vibes into the funky melody. Beyond this vocally feminine sound, the way consumers heard Brit funk shifted as the role of live performance joined the popularity of the 1970s DJ in clubs. By the 1980s, it was common for clubs to bring in Brit funk performers alongside DJs incorporating both an open and intimate space on the dancefloor. Brit funk was marked by these dualities: feminine and masculine, pleasure and politics, exclusionary and accessible. In 2017, former members of Hi-Tension, Light of the World and Beggar &amp; Co formed a new band, The Brit Funk Association and began reviving the genre performing a repertoire from their respective catalogues.

Robert Strachan&#x27;s &quot;Britfunk: Black British Popular Music, Identity and the Recording Industry in the Early 1980s&quot; highlights Britfunk&#x27;s history as well as how Black music in the UK intersects with race, class, politics, nationality, culture, and gender. To start, Britfunk was significant for expressing Black British identity and drew from a range of African American music genres such as soul, jazz, electro, and hip-hop. the musical genres embodied by Britfunk are not bound by the borders and cultures of the Caribbean, which is where Black Britishness is most strongly linked. As a result of Britfunk&#x27;s unboundedness, it was able to spark &quot;fluidity of identity and space where strict cultural boundaries in terms of identity, gender and ethnicity could be negotiated, blurred and articulated&quot; (Strachan 69). Moreover, in the construction of Black British identity, Britfunk was less like reggae in the sense that it had less &quot;conscious engagement with politics and identity&quot; and more elements of mainstream pop.

More recently, Tyler, the Creator acknowledged the influence of Brit funk on his work when he gave his acceptance speech for the Brit Award for International Male Solo Artist at the 2020 Brit Awards.

=== Continuities between Brit funk and disco ===
Gaining inspiration from various musical genres, Brit funk continued and built off of technological and symbolic themes present in U.S. disco. Author Robert Strachan described that Brit funk became recognised for its &quot;use of electronic production, drum machines, electronic bass and the stripped down aesthetic of electro presented a slick, ultra-modern musical aesthetic combined with visual codes accessed from American disco acts.&quot; Furthermore, Brit funk seemed to follow in disco&#x27;s footsteps in regard to expression of gender and sexuality. Writers including Tim Lawrence, Bill Brewster and Frank Broughton discussed how disco ushered in a unique moment in which gender and sexuality queerness gained &quot;recognition&quot; in mainstream music. The disco genre fostered a culture that highlighted and celebrated a sense of fluidity and &quot;multipleness&quot; that was revolutionary in its day. Like disco, Brit funk also represented a unique moment of fluidity in gender expression and sexuality. Britfunk was emerging in a time in the UK in which gender-play was entering the mainstream pop scene from strains of UK club scenes and formed around unique identity politics. Such politics were highly entangled with pleasure on the dance floor which was the essence of U.S. disco as well. Such pleasure in both Brit funk (and disco) was ambiguous, &quot;in terms of gender and sexuality ...&quot; Strachan said that many Brit funk artists &quot;were clearly drawing upon outré and undoubtedly gay styles that had emerged in the club scenes&quot;, and the aesthetics of Brit funk can now &quot;... be read as escaping fixed notions of identity.&quot;

<text>Count Francesco Baracca (9 May 1888 – 19 June 1918) was Italy&#x27;s top fighter ace of World War I. He was credited with 34 aerial victories. The emblem he wore side by side on his plane of a black horse prancing on its two rear hooves inspired Enzo Ferrari to use it on his racing car and later in his automotive company.

==Biography==
Baracca was born in Lugo di Romagna. He was the son of wealthy landowner Count Enrico Baracca and his wife Paolina. The younger Baracca initially studied at a private school in Florence before entering the Military Academy of Modena in October 1907. As he had become a passionate equestrian as an antidote to classroom boredom, he became a cavalryman with the prestigious &quot;&quot; Regiment upon his commissioning in 1910. His first duty station allowed him to attend concerts and opera in Rome, as well as pursue hunting and equestrian competitions; he gained some fame in the latter. This little idyll was spoiled by orders to report to a small town in central Italy. Baracca then became interested in aviation and learned to fly at Reims, France, receiving his pilot&#x27;s license on 9 July 1912. He then served with the &quot;Battaglione Aviatori&quot; and in 1914 with the 5th and 6th &quot;Squadriglie&quot;.

===World War I===

During the months between the outbreak of World War I and Italy&#x27;s entry into the war, there was intense political controversy in Italy between pro-war and pro-peace factions. Baracca remained aloofly neutral but ready to serve his nation. After Italy&#x27;s entry into the war on the Entente side in May 1915, he was sent to Paris to convert to Nieuport two-seaters. Upon his return in July, he was assigned to the &quot;8a Squadriglia Nieuport&quot;. The Nieuport 10s that equipped this squadron were almost useless against Austro-Hungarian raids; they were too slow, with too slow a rate of climb, to bring the intruders to battle with any regularity. The frustrated Italian pilots even resorted to leaving their observers ground-bound in attempts to improve performance, to little avail. On those rare occasions when the battle was joined, the Nieuports&#x27; guns usually jammed. Renaming the unit to &quot;1a Squadriglia Caccia&quot; on 1 December 1915 did nothing to solve the problems.

The Nieuport 11 single-seat fighter with Lewis guns entered service in April 1916, and on 7 April, flying this new fighter, Baracca scored his first victory, holing the fuel tank of an Austrian Hansa-Brandenburg C.I having received forty-five hits, was forced to land and the crew, composed of Sergeant Adolf Ott and Lieutenant Observer Franz Lenarcic (who later died of the wounds) of Flik 19, was taken prisoner.This was also Italy&#x27;s first aerial victory in the war. This first victory featured his favourite manoeuvre, which was to zoom in unseen behind and below an enemy and fire his machine gun from pistol range.

It was around this time that Baracca adopted as a personal emblem a black prancing horse on his Nieuport 17, in tribute to his former cavalry regiment. This prompted some to call him, &quot;The Cavalier of the Skies&quot;. Flying the Nieuport 17 and then, from March 1917, the SPAD VII, he scored both individually, and in combination with other Italian aces.

Baracca&#x27;s second victory was an Austrian Lohner over Gorizia on 23 April 1916. After his third victory, he transferred to 70a Squadriglia. Promoted to &quot;Capitano&quot;; On 28 November he shot down his fifth aircraft in battle, obtaining registration in the Register of Aces. That day Baracca achieved his victory in the late morning at Tolmezzo with 30 machine gun shots against the Brandenburg C.I of the Flik 16 of the observer Kálmán Sarközy who was wounded and prisoner and Fritz Fuchs, who did not survive the duel. On 1 January 1917 Baracca shot down an Austrian Brandenburg plane of Flik 12 near Castagnevizza flying on Ni 17 2614. On 11 February Baracca (on Ni 17) with Fulco Ruffo di Calabria (on Ni 17), serg. Giulio Poli and Corporal Antonio Pagliari (on Ni 11) shoot down Corporal Ludwig Fleck&#x27;s Br. C.1 with observer Lieutenant Wilhelm Siemienski of Flik 35 who, after hitting the tank of Corporal Anselmo Caselli&#x27;s Nieuport 11 who returns in emergency, while the reconnaissance plane with the two wounded crew members manages to make a crash landing by hitting a tree and ruining its wings in the meadows near Remanzacco after a battle over the sky of Udine attended by Vittorio Emanuele III of Savoy who the next day went to the camp to congratulate the pilots.On 26 April Baracca shot down the Br. C.1 of the Zgsf. Josef Majsai and the Leut. Emmerich Treer of Flik 35 with the help of Serg. Goffredo Gorini (formerly of the 3rd Artillery Squadron) and Attilio Imolesi of the 79th Squadron near San Martino del Carso, reaching 8 victories and receiving the cross of the Military Order of Savoy.Baracca remained with the unit until, with 9 victories, he transferred to the newly formed 91st &quot;Squadriglia&quot;, known as the &quot;Squadron of the Aces&quot;, on 1 May 1917. By that time, his ever-increasing list of victories had made him nationally famous. While he initially dodged the responsibilities and paperwork that went with command, he finally settled into heading the squadron. On 1 May, during a reconnaissance mission over Monfalcone, piloting the Hansa-Brandenburg C.I 229.08 of Flik 12, Frank Linke-Crawford had the opportunity to clash with Baracca&#x27;s SPAD S.VII: the two dueled for a long time, in a very hard fight that developed from 4,000 meters to low altitude. Baracca was convinced that he had shot down his opponent, but Linke-Crawford was able to complete the mission despite 68 bullet holes found on the plane. On 10 May, Baracca shot down Zugsführer Rudolf Stöhr&#x27;s Hansa-Brandenburg D.I of the FliK 41J near Vertoiba and achieved his ninth official victory. On 13 May Baracca obtained another victory in collaboration over Br. C.1 of ace Julius Busa and observer Hermann Grössler of Fluggeschwader 1 (FlG I) on Mount Korada.On 20 May, as part of the tenth Isonzo offensive, Baracca hit a Brandenburg reconnaissance aircraft of Flik 12 on Monte Santo in Gorizia with incendiary bullets that crashed at an altitude of 363 m of Plava, a few meters from the Italian trenches. On 3 June Baracca shot down the Hansa-Brandenburg C.I of the Zgsf. Johann Rotter with the Oblt. Max Bednarzik from the Fluggeschwader 1 or FlG. I between Plava and Monte Cucco di Plava. Baracca&#x27;s friend Fulco Ruffo di Calabria nearly ended Baracca&#x27;s career — and life — in June 1917. Ruffo di Calabria burst out of a cloud firing in a head-on pass at an enemy airplane, and barely missed Baracca. Later, on the ground, Baracca assured his companion, &quot;Dear Fulco, next time, if you want to shoot me down, aim a couple of metres to the right. Now let&#x27;s go for a drink and not talk of it any more!&quot;
Baracca temporarily upgraded to a Spad XIII in October 1917, using it to achieve a couple of victories on 22 October, and on a win scored on a joint sortie with Pier Piccio on 25 October. That night he wrote: &quot;I had my SPAD shot up and its longeron broken into pieces by enemy machine gun fire in an aerial dogfight.&quot; As a result, Baracca returned to the more manoeuvrable Spad VII, remarking, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter if the VII is equipped with a single gun. Provided you are a good fighter, a single gun is just enough.&quot; Nevertheless, after repair, he sometimes returned to the Spad XIII.

A dedicated fighter pilot, Baracca found life away from the front unbearable and remained as much as possible with the 91st &quot;Squadriglia&quot;, even after being promoted to &quot;Maggiore&quot; in November 1917. Baracca remained a modest, sensitive man conscious of his duty and compassionate to both his squadron comrades and to his defeated enemies. He would try to visit his victims in hospital afterwards, to pay his respects, or he would place a wreath on the grave of those he killed. He had raised his score to 30 by the end of 1917.

Soon afterwards, Baracca, Piccio, and Ruffo di Calabria were tasked with evaluating the new Ansaldo A.1 Balilla fighter. Baracca was personally decorated by King Victor Emmanuel III at La Scala at this time. It was March 1918 before Baracca convinced his superiors that he belonged back at the front. He was not long back before he found himself in a situation similar to the previous late October: his squadron was forced to withdraw by enemy advances on 27 April. It was about this time that he adopted the griffin as an insignia for the planes in his unit. Most of his pilots adopted it, though some still flaunted the prancing stallion as a gesture of respect for their commander.

===Death===

Baracca saw little action in 1918, but he added more victories, for a total of 34, before failing to return from a strafing mission on the Montello (hill) area on 19 June.

The Italians were taking advantage of their air superiority to fly treetop ground attack missions into a storm of small-arms fire. In the 06:30 troop support mission, Baracca and rookie pilot &quot;Tenente&quot; Franco Osnago were hit by ground fire and split from one another. A few minutes later, both Baracca&#x27;s home airfield and Osnago saw a burning airplane fall. According to other sources, Baracca had left Osnago to provide him with top cover as he dived on the enemy trenches. Osnago lost sight of his commander, then he saw something burning in a nearby valley.
Some days later, on 24 June, after an Austro-Hungarian retreat, Baracca&#x27;s remains were recovered from where they lay, four meters from the burnt remnants of his Spad VII. A monument in his memory was later built on the site. Osnago, Ferruccio Ranza, and a journalist named Garinei retrieved his body for the large funeral that was held in his home town of Lugo.

His body, when found, reportedly bore the marks of a bullet to the head. His pistol was out of its holster, but away from his body, leading to suspicions that he elected to take his own life rather than die in a crash or be taken prisoner. An Austrian pilot reportedly claimed to have shot him down in combat. This claim is allegedly supported by evidence, but the most accepted version is that Baracca was hit by ground fire. Research in Austro-Hungarian records indicates that he was killed by the gunner of an Austrian two-seater while attacking from above and behind. (On that day at 18.10 a C.I reconnaissance aircraft of Flik 28 took off, piloted by Max Kauer with Arnold Barwig as observer-gunner. They had to fly to the front of the 17th Division to take photographs, a dangerous task with the air dominance now ensured by the Italian air force. During the flight they saw two Spad fighters approaching about a kilometer away and promptly maneuvered to fight them. First the observer fired a volley of 15-20 shots at one of them who was going down, then they saw him climb up to the right and fired him again, setting him on fire.)

Ltn Arnold Barwig in Phönix C.I 121.17, piloted by Zgsf Max Kauer, claimed to have shot down the Italian ace. The Austrian crew also photographed the shot-down aeroplane and noted the time and place of engagement.

==Legacy==

Baracca&#x27;s total of 34 victory claims can largely be verified from known Austro-Hungarian losses and surviving military records, establishing the Italian as one of the highest-scoring Allied pilots during the conflict. After the war, his home in Lugo di Romagna was turned into the Francesco Baracca Museum, which displays mementoes, uniforms, and medals from Baracca&#x27;s life, as well as rudders and guns taken from shot-down aircraft. In the 1920s, a SPAD VII once flown by Baracca in December 1917 was presented for display, which was subsequently restored by GVAS (the Italian aeronautical preservation society).

Many roads in Italy are named after Baracca. The airport of Bolzano, a city in the region of Trentino-Alto Adige, the Roma-Centocelle Italian Air Force base, and the Lugo di Romagna airfield are all named after Baracca. A huge monument to his memory dominates the main square of his home town at Lugo di Romagna.

In later years, Baracca&#x27;s mother presented his prancing stallion emblem, the &quot;Cavallino Rampante&quot;, to Enzo Ferrari. The prancing horse has been the official symbol of the Scuderia Ferrari racing team since 1929, and of Ferrari automobiles since they began being manufactured. The roller coaster at Ferrari World on Yas Island Flying Aces, is named after him and themed to him.

He was decorated with the Order of Karađorđe&#x27;s Star with swords and a number of other decorations.

<doc id="666087" wikidata="Q2746900" url="?curid=666087" title="Bill Veeck">
<text>William Louis Veeck Jr. ( ; February 9, 1914 – January 2, 1986), also known as &quot;Sport Shirt Bill&quot; and &quot;Wild Bill&quot;, was an American Major League Baseball franchise owner and promoter. Veeck was at various times the owner of the Cleveland Indians, the St. Louis Browns, and the Chicago White Sox.

Veeck was the last owner to purchase a baseball franchise without an independent fortune and was responsible for many innovations and contributions to baseball. As owner and team president of the Indians in 1947, Veeck signed Larry Doby, thus beginning the integration of the American League, and the following year won a World Series title.

Unable to compete in the new era of salary escalation ignited by arbitration and free agency, Veeck sold his ownership interest in the White Sox after the 1980 season. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame posthumously in 1991.

==Early life==
Bill Veeck was born on February 9, 1914, in Chicago. While Veeck was growing up in Hinsdale, Illinois, his father, William Veeck Sr., became president of the Chicago Cubs. Veeck Sr. was a local sports writer who wrote numerous columns about how he would run the Cubs differently, and the team&#x27;s owner, William Wrigley Jr., took him up on the implied offer. While growing up, the younger Veeck worked as a popcorn vendor for the Cubs and also as a part-time concession salesman for the crosstown Chicago White Sox. Later, in 1937, he came up with the idea of planting ivy on the walls of Wrigley Field. Veeck attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. In 1933, when his father died, Veeck left Kenyon College and eventually became club treasurer for the Cubs. In 1935, he married his first wife, Eleanor.

==Franchise owner==

===Minor League Baseball===

====Milwaukee Brewers====
In 1940, Veeck left Chicago and, in a syndicate with former Cubs star and manager Charlie Grimm, purchased the then-struggling Triple-A Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association. After winning three pennants in five seasons Veeck sold his Milwaukee franchise in 1945 for a $275,000 profit.

According to his autobiography &quot;Veeck – As in Wreck&quot;, Veeck claimed to have installed a screen to make the right field target a little more difficult for left-handed pull hitters of the opposing team. The screen was on wheels, so any given day it might be in place or not, depending on the batting strength of the opposing team. There was no rule against that activity as such, but Veeck then took it to an extreme, rolling it out when the opponents batted, and pulling it back when the Brewers batted. Veeck reported that the league passed a rule against it the very next day. However, extensive research by two members of the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) suggests that this story was made up or certainly exaggerated by Veeck. The two researchers could not find any references to a moveable fence or any reference to the gear required for a moveable fence to work.

While a co-owner of the Brewers, Veeck served for nearly three years in the United States Marine Corps during World War II in an artillery unit. During this time a recoiling artillery piece crushed his right leg, requiring amputation first of the foot, and shortly after of the leg above the knee. Over the course of his life he had 36 operations on the leg. He had a series of wooden legs and, as an inveterate smoker, cut holes in them to use as ashtrays.
Veeck also used the wooden leg in props such as a recreation of iconic Revolutionary War soldiers during the Bicentennial year of 1976. At other times, engaged in intensive trade talks with competing owners, Veeck would complain they were demanding &quot;an arm and a leg&quot; in negotiations, then unbuckle the leg and throw it on the desktop for dramatic effect.

===Major League Baseball===

====Attempted purchase of Philadelphia Phillies====
Veeck had been a fan of the Negro leagues since his early teens. He had also admired Abe Saperstein&#x27;s Harlem Globetrotters basketball team, which was based in Chicago. Saperstein saved Veeck from financial disaster early on in Milwaukee by giving him the right to promote the Globetrotters in the upper Midwest in the winter of 1941–42.

In the fall of 1942, Veeck met with Gerry Nugent, president of the Philadelphia Phillies, to discuss the possibility of buying the struggling National League team. He later wrote in his memoirs that he intended to buy the Phillies and stock the team&#x27;s roster with stars from the Negro leagues. Although no formal rules barred African-American players from the majors, none had appeared in organized baseball since the 1890s.

Veeck quickly secured financing to buy the Phillies, and agreed in principle to buy the team from Nugent. While on his way to Philadelphia to close on the purchase, Veeck decided to alert MLB Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis of his intentions.

Veeck did not believe Landis would dare say black players were unwelcome while blacks were fighting in World War II. However, when Veeck arrived in Philadelphia, he was surprised to discover that the National League had taken over the Phillies and was seeking a new owner (the Phillies were ultimately sold to lumber baron William D. Cox).

The authors of a controversial article in the 1998 issue of SABR&#x27;s &quot;The National Pastime&quot; argued that Veeck invented the story of buying the Phillies and filling their roster with Negro leaguers, claiming Philadelphia&#x27;s black press made no mention of a prospective sale to Veeck.

Subsequently, the article was criticized by historian Jules Tygiel, who reviewed it point-by-point in an article in the 2006 issue of SABR&#x27;s &quot;The Baseball Research Journal&quot;, and in an appendix, entitled &quot;Did Bill Veeck Lie About His Plan to Purchase the &#x27;43 Phillies?&quot;, published in Paul Dickson&#x27;s biography, &quot;Bill Veeck: Baseball&#x27;s Greatest Maverick&quot;. In the SABR article, Tygiel explained that Veeck and others had mentioned the alleged scheme to buy and stock the Phillies up to fifteen years before the publication of Veeck&#x27;s memoir, but conceded that, &quot;In all of these accounts the only voice telling the story remains Veeck&#x27;s.&quot; The Tygiel article also conceded, &quot;The overall assessment of Jordan, et al. - that Veeck&#x27;s notion of buying the Phillies and fielding a team of Negro League stars never quite moved as far from the drawing board as Veeck claimed - may still be true. We still lack any solid evidence that confirms that Veeck had not only conceptualized this action, but made a firm offer to buy the Phillies and met a rebuff by Landis and (then-National League president Ford) Frick.&quot;

====Cleveland Indians====
In 1946, having sold his interest in the Class AAA Milwaukee Brewers, Veeck became the owner of a major league team, the Cleveland Indians. He immediately put all the team&#x27;s games on radio (previously, only limited games had been broadcast). He also moved the team to Cleveland Municipal Stadium permanently in 1947. The team had split their games between the larger Municipal Stadium and the smaller League Park since the 1930s. However, Veeck concluded that League Park, which had been built in its final form in 1910, was far too small and deteriorated to be viable.

In July of that year, he signed Larry Doby, the first black player to play in the American League. Doby&#x27;s first game was on July 5 and before the game, Doby was introduced to his teammates by player-manager Lou Boudreau. &quot;One by one, Lou introduced me to each player. &#x27;This is Joe Gordon,&#x27; and Gordon put his hand out. &#x27;This is Bob Lemon,&#x27; and Lemon put his hand out. &#x27;This is Jim Hegan,&#x27; and Hegan put his hand out. All the guys put their hand out, all but three. As soon as he could, Bill Veeck got rid of those three&quot;, Doby said. The following year Veeck signed Satchel Paige to a contract, making him the oldest rookie ever in Major League Baseball history.

To take advantage of the large size of Cleveland Municipal Stadium, Veeck had a portable center field fence installed in 1947, which he could move in or out depending on how the distance favored the Indians against their opponents in a given series. The fence moved as much as between series opponents. Following the 1947 season, the American League countered with a rule change that fixed the distance of an outfield wall for the duration of a season.

As in Milwaukee, Veeck took a unique approach to promotions, hiring Max Patkin, the &quot;Clown Prince of Baseball&quot;, as a coach. Patkin&#x27;s appearance in the coaching box delighted fans and infuriated the front office of the American League.
Although Veeck had become extremely popular, an attempt in 1947 to trade Boudreau to the St. Louis Browns led to mass protests and petitions supporting Boudreau. Veeck, in response, said he would listen to the fans, and re-signed Boudreau to a new two-year contract. Veeck claimed later that the trade talks had already broken down before they became public, but he seized the opportunity to promote the concept he had dropped the idea of the trade in response to public outcry.

By 1948, led by Boudreau&#x27;s .355 batting average, Cleveland won its first pennant and World Series since 1920 (as of 2023, this remains the team&#x27;s, now known as the Guardians, last World Series title). Famously, the following season Veeck buried the 1948 flag, once it became mathematically certain the team could not repeat its championship in 1949. Later that year, Veeck&#x27;s first wife, Eleanor, filed for divorce. Most of his money was tied up in the Indians, so he was forced to sell the team to fund the divorce settlement. One year later, in 1950, Veeck married his second wife, Mary Frances Ackerman. He had met her the previous year while in Cleveland.

====St. Louis Browns====
After his second marriage, Veeck bought an 80% stake in the St. Louis Browns in 1951. Hoping to force the NL&#x27;s St. Louis Cardinals out of town, Veeck hired Cardinal greats Rogers Hornsby and Marty Marion as managers, and Dizzy Dean as an announcer; and he decorated their shared home park, Sportsman&#x27;s Park, exclusively with Browns memorabilia. Ironically the Cardinals had been the Browns&#x27; tenants since 1920, even though they had long since passed the Browns as St. Louis&#x27; favorite team.

Some of Veeck&#x27;s most memorable publicity stunts occurred during his tenure with the Browns, including the appearance on August 19, 1951, by Eddie Gaedel, who had dwarfism and stood tall, and is the shortest person to appear in a Major League Baseball game. Veeck sent Gaedel to pinch hit in the bottom of the first inning of the second game of a double header. Wearing &quot;1/8&quot; as his uniform number, Gaedel was walked on four straight pitches and then was pulled for a pinch runner.

Shortly afterwards &quot;Grandstand Manager&#x27;s Day&quot; – involving Veeck, Connie Mack, and thousands of regular fans, enabled the crowd to vote on various in-game strategic decisions (i.e., steal, bunt, change pitchers) by holding up placards: the Browns won, 5–3, snapping a four-game losing streak.

After the 1952 season, Veeck suggested that the American League clubs share radio and television revenue with visiting clubs, a proposal anathema to the powerful Yankees, whose broadcasting revenues dwarfed all the other AL franchises. Outvoted, he refused to allow the Browns&#x27; opponents to broadcast games played against his team on the road. The league responded by eliminating the lucrative Friday night games in St. Louis.

A year later, Cardinals owner Fred Saigh was convicted of tax evasion. Facing certain banishment from baseball, he was forced to put the Cardinals up for sale. At first, the only credible offers came from out-of-town interests, and it appeared that Veeck would succeed in driving the Cardinals out of town. However, just as Saigh was about to sell the Cardinals to interests who would have moved them to Houston, Texas, he instead accepted a much lower bid from St. Louis-based brewing giant Anheuser-Busch, who entered the picture with the specific intent of keeping the Cardinals in town. It has long been claimed that Saigh was persuaded to accept Anheuser-Busch&#x27;s bid more out of civic duty than money. However, according to Anheuser-Busch historian William Knoedelseder, Saigh&#x27;s first preference all along was to sell the Cardinals to interests who would keep the team in St. Louis.

What is beyond dispute is that as soon as Anheuser-Busch closed on its purchase of the Cardinals, Veeck knew he was finished in St. Louis. He quickly realized that with Anheuser-Busch&#x27;s wealth behind them, the Cardinals now had more financial resources than he could even begin to match, especially since he had no other source of income. Reluctantly, he decided to move the Browns elsewhere. As a preliminary step, he sold Sportsman&#x27;s Park to the Cardinals, who would eventually rename it as the first incarnation of Busch Stadium.

At first Veeck considered moving the Browns back to Milwaukee (where they had played their inaugural season in 1901). Milwaukee recently built Milwaukee County Stadium in an attempt to entice a major league franchise.

However, the decision was in the hands of the Boston Braves, the parent team of the Brewers. Under major league rules of the time, the Braves held the major league rights to Milwaukee. The Braves wanted another team with the same talent if the Brewers were shut down, and an agreement was not made in time for the start of the 1953 season. Ironically, a few weeks later, the Braves themselves moved to Milwaukee. St. Louis was known to want the team to stay, so some in St. Louis campaigned for the removal of Veeck.

Undaunted, Veeck got in touch with a group that was looking to bring a major league franchise to Baltimore, Maryland. After the 1953 season, Veeck agreed in principle to sell half his stock to Baltimore attorney Clarence Miles, the front man of the Baltimore group, and his other partners. He would have remained the principal owner, with approximately a 40% interest. Even though league president Will Harridge told him approval was certain, only four owners—two short of the necessary six for passage—supported it. Realizing the other owners simply wanted him out of the picture (indeed, he was facing threats of having his franchise canceled), Veeck agreed to sell his entire stake to Miles&#x27; group, who then moved the Browns to Baltimore, where they were renamed as the Orioles, which has been their name ever since.

====Chicago White Sox====
Taking advantage of inter-familial friction within the Comiskey family, in 1959, Veeck became head of a group that purchased a controlling interest in the Chicago White Sox. Following Veeck&#x27;s acquisition of the team, the White Sox went on to win their first pennant in 40 years. That year the White Sox broke a team attendance record for home games with 1.4 million. The next year the team broke the same record with 1.6 million visitors to Comiskey Park with the addition of the first &quot;exploding scoreboard&quot; in the major leagues – producing electrical and sound effects, and shooting fireworks whenever the White Sox hit a home run. The &quot;exploding scoreboard&quot; was carried over to the &quot;new&quot; Comiskey Park (now Rate Field) when it opened in 1991.

One year later in 1960, Veeck and former Detroit Tigers great Hank Greenberg, his partner with the Indians and White Sox, reportedly made a strong bid for the American League expansion franchise in Los Angeles. Greenberg would have been the principal owner, with Veeck as a minority partner. However Los Angeles Dodgers owner Walter O&#x27;Malley was not willing to compete with a team owned by Veeck, even if he would only be a minority partner. When O&#x27;Malley heard of the deal, he invoked his exclusive franchise rights for Southern California. Any potential owner of an American League team in the area would have had to have O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s approval, and it was apparent that O&#x27;Malley would not allow any team to set up shop with Veeck as a major shareholder. Rather than try to persuade his friend to back out, Greenberg abandoned his bid for what became the Los Angeles Angels.
In 1961, due to poor health, Veeck sold his share of the White Sox to John and Arthur Allyn for $2.5 million. After selling the White Sox, Veeck worked intermittently as a television commentator for ABC. Veeck then moved to the Eastern Shore of Maryland with his family to convalesce.

When his health improved, Veeck made an unsuccessful attempt to buy the Washington Senators, then operated the Suffolk Downs race track in Boston in 1969–70. He also tried to buy the Baltimore Orioles in 1974 but failed due to troubles with the IRS. Veeck was not heard from again in baseball ownership circles until 1975, when he repurchased the White Sox from John Allyn (sole owner since 1969). Veeck&#x27;s return rankled baseball&#x27;s establishment, most owners viewing him as a pariah after exposing industry politics and maneuvering in his 1961 book &quot;Veeck As In Wreck.&quot; The owners were also unhappy with Veeck&#x27;s extensive unfavorable discussion of the 1964 purchase of the New York Yankees by CBS in 1965&#x27;s &quot;The Hustler&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (a move Veeck felt exposed MLB to dangerous antitrust liabilities and endangered the antitrust exemption established in a 1922 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court). The White Sox were slated to move to Seattle, Washington for the amount of $14 million while Charlie O. Finley planned to move his Oakland Athletics to Chicago. However, it was Andy McKenna who approached Veeck about the possibility of returning home to Chicago, which got Veeck to assemble an ownership group to make an offer for the team. On December 16, 1975, Veeck&#x27;s group purchased the team from Allyn.

Almost immediately after reassuming control of the Sox, Veeck unleashed another publicity stunt. He and general manager Roland Hemond conducted four trades in a hotel lobby, in full view of the public; other owners considered this undignified. Two weeks later, however, arbitrator Peter Seitz&#x27;s ruling struck down the reserve clause and ushered in the era of free agency, leading to dramatic increases in player salaries. Ironically Veeck had been the only baseball owner to testify in support of Curt Flood during his landmark court case, at which Flood had attempted to gain free agency after being traded to the Philadelphia Phillies. Veeck had proposed a gradual transition to a free-agent system in which players would gain free agency rights after a certain amount of service time. The owners gambled that Seitz would rule in their favor and maintain the reserve clause; he did not.

On the field, Veeck presented a Bicentennial-themed &quot;Spirit of &#x27;76&quot; parade on Opening Day in 1976, casting himself as the peg-legged fifer bringing up the rear. In the same year he reactivated Minnie Miñoso for eight at-bats, in order to give Miñoso a claim towards playing in four decades; he did so again in 1980, to expand the claim to five. He also unveiled radically altered uniforms for the players, including clamdigger pants and even shorts, which the Sox wore for the first time against the Kansas City Royals on August 8, 1976.

In an attempt to adapt to free agency, he developed a &quot;rent-a-player&quot; model, centering on the acquisition of other clubs&#x27; stars in their option years. The gambit was moderately successful: in 1977 the White Sox won 90 games and finished in third place with additions such as Oscar Gamble and Richie Zisk.

During this last run, Veeck decided to have announcer Harry Caray sing &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; during the seventh inning stretch. Veeck asked Caray to sing for the entire park, but he refused. Veeck replied that he already had a recording, so Caray would be heard either way. Caray reluctantly agreed to sing it live, accompanied by White Sox organist Nancy Faust, and went on to become famous for singing the tune, continuing to do so at Wrigley Field after becoming the broadcaster of the Chicago Cubs in 1982. This tradition has continued there ever since, even after the death of Caray in 1998.

The 1979 season was filled with more promotions. On April 10, he offered fans free admission the day after a 10–2 Opening Day defeat by the Toronto Blue Jays. On July 12, Veeck, with assistance from son Mike and radio personality Steve Dahl, held one of his most infamous promotions, Disco Demolition Night, between games of a scheduled doubleheader, which resulted in a riot at Comiskey Park and a forfeit to the visiting Detroit Tigers.

==Life after baseball==
Finding himself no longer able to financially compete in the free agent era, Veeck sold the White Sox in January 1981, albeit not without controversy, as his first choice in Edward J. DeBartolo Sr. (owner of the NHL&#x27;s Pittsburgh Penguins and the NFL&#x27;s San Francisco 49ers) was rejected by a league vote (eight votes in favor with ten required to pass). Veeck then sold the Sox to his second choice, Jerry Reinsdorf and partner Eddie Einhorn for $20 million. When Einhorn stated his desire to make the White Sox a &quot;high-class operation&quot;, Veeck publicly transferred his allegiance back to the Chicago Cubs, the team his father had operated in his youth (at any rate, when the White Sox won the 2005 World Series, the Veeck family received championship rings from the organization). Veeck retired to his home in Chicago but in summer could often be found in the Wrigley Field bleachers. Veeck also wrote occasional articles for magazines and newspapers, usually opining on the overall state of baseball.

==Declining health and death==
Veeck had been a heavy smoker and drinker until 1980. In 1984, Veeck underwent two operations for lung cancer. Two years later, on the day after New Year&#x27;s Day, 1986, he died at the age of 71 from cancer. He was posthumously elected five years later to the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Veeck was survived by his wife, Mary Frances, and eight of his nine children. Two of the surviving children, Peter and Ellen, were from his first marriage, and the others (Mike, Marya, Greg, Lisa, Julie and Chris) were from his second marriage. He was predeceased by his eldest child, William III, who died in 1985. His body was cremated. Mike Veeck became a minor league and independent baseball executive and was the co-founder of the St. Paul Saints, a successful charter member of the Northern League. The younger Veeck emulated many of Bill Veeck&#x27;s promotional stunts with the Saints. Greg Veeck earned a Ph.D. at the University of Georgia in 1988 and is a geography professor at Western Michigan University focusing on urban geology and East Asia.

Mary Frances Veeck died in Hyde Park, Ill., on September 10, 2022, at the age of 102.

==Books by Veeck==
Veeck wrote three autobiographical works, each a collaboration with journalist and sportswriter Ed Linn. The first two were reissued in updated editions in the 1980s following Veeck&#x27;s return to baseball ownership. The books include:
*&quot;Veeck as In Wreck&quot; (1962) – a straightforward autobiography, later updated after Veeck&#x27;s then-declining health forced him to sell his interest in the White Sox.
*&quot;The Hustler&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (1965) – a sequel and extension of &quot;Wreck&quot;, divulging his experiences in operating as an outsider in the major leagues, detailing many episodes of behind-the-scenes drama in baseball, including the 1965 acquisition of the New York Yankees by CBS and the maneuvering involved in the move of the Milwaukee Braves to Atlanta, and also a recounting of the 1919 Black Sox Scandal through a diary by Harry Grabiner, business manager of the White Sox in 1919 and much later, an associate of Veeck with the Indians in 1948.
*&quot;Thirty Tons a Day&quot; (1972) – chronicling the time he spent running Suffolk Downs racetrack in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The title refers to the daily quantity of waste (horse excrement, used hay and straw, etc.) that required disposal.

==Awards and honors==

<text>In Breton folklore, a Korrigan () is a fairy or dwarf-like spirit. The word &quot;korrigan&quot; means in Breton &quot;small-dwarf&quot; (&quot;korr&quot; means dwarf, &quot;ig&quot; is a diminutive and the suffix &quot;an&quot; is a hypocoristic). It is closely related to the Cornish word &quot;korrik&quot; which means &quot;gnome&quot;. The name changes according to the place. Among the other names, there are &quot;korrig&quot;, &quot;korred&quot;, &quot;korrs&quot;, &quot;kores&quot;, &quot;couril&quot;, &quot;crion&quot;, &quot;goric&quot;, &quot;kornandon&quot;, &quot;ozigan&quot;, &quot;nozigan&quot;, &quot;teuz&quot;, &quot;torrigan&quot;, &quot;viltañs&quot;, &quot;poulpikan&quot;, &quot;poulpiquet&quot;, and &quot;paotred ar sabad&quot;.

==As fairies and dwarves==
The term is used variously by writers on Breton folklore. Théodore de Villemarqué in &quot;Barzaz Breiz&quot; uses the term interchangeably with &quot;fairy&quot; and distinguishes them from dwarves (&quot;nains&quot;). In contrast Walter Evans-Wentz in &quot;The Fairy Faith in Celtic Countries&quot; argued that in the mythology of Morbihan there is no clear distinction between korrigans and nains: &quot;Very often corrigans regarded as nains, equally with all kinds of &quot;lutins&quot;, are believed to be evil spirits or demons condemned to live here on earth in a penitential state for an indefinite time.&quot; They like to dance around fountains. However, they give themselves away when they cannot enumerate the full list of the days of the week (because of the sacredness of the full week).

==As siren water-sprites==
Other authors use the term only to refer to siren-like female fairies who inhabit springs and rivers, &quot;lovely lustful golden-haired women who tried to lure men into their beds – and into a watery death&quot;. These creatures are very beautiful when seen at dusk or night, but by day their eyes are red, their hair white, and their skin wrinkled; thus they try to avoid being seen by day.

Korrigans have beautiful hair and red flashing eyes. They are sometimes described as important princesses or druidesses who were opposed to Christianity when the Apostles came to convert Brittany. They hate priests, churches, and especially the Virgin Mary. They can predict the future, change shape, and move at lightning speed. Like sirens and mermaids, they sing and comb their long hair, and they haunt fountains and water wells. They have the power of making men fall in love with them, but they then kill the ones who do. In many popular tales, they are eager to deceive the imprudent mortals who see them dancing or looking after a treasure, and fond of stealing human children, substituting them with changelings. On the night of 31 October (Samhain), they are said to be lurking near dolmens, waiting for victims.

According to the Breton poem &quot;Ar rannoù&quot;, there are 9 korrigans, &quot;who dance, with flowers in their hair, and robes of white wool, around the fountain, by the light of the full moon.&quot;

<text>Cyril Dean Darlington (19 December 1903 – 26 March 1981) was an English biologist, cytologist, geneticist, and eugenicist. He discovered the mechanics of chromosomal crossover, its role in inheritance, and thus its importance to evolution. He was the Sherardian Professor of Botany at the University of Oxford from 1953 to 1971.

Darlington&#x27;s research on genetics contributed to the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 20th century. However, many of his views are controversial; Darlington was listed in 1999 by the Southern Poverty Law Center as an example of a prominent race scientist who espoused antisemitism, eugenics, racism, and social Darwinism.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Cyril Darlington was born in Chorley, a small cotton town in Lancashire, England in 1903. He had one brother, six years older. His father, William, was a teacher at a small school. When Darlington was eight, the family moved to London. His childhood was an unhappy one, characterized by a stern, bitter, and frustrated father, who struggled against poverty. Darlington enjoyed neither sports nor studies (including at the Mercers&#x27; School and St Paul&#x27;s School, London). He began to develop a disdain for authority. He decided to become a farmer in Australia, so he applied to the South Eastern Agricultural College at Wye, known later as Wye College. He was an indifferent student, but his social life took a turn for the better when he took up boxing, with moderate success. He was then six feet three inches tall, and an imposing figure. One subject that captured his imagination, however, was Mendelian genetics, taught by the myriapodologist Stanley Graham Brade-Birks. Darlington&#x27;s interest in the subject began after he discovered Thomas Hunt Morgan&#x27;s &quot;The Physical Basis of Heredity.&quot; He graduated with a London University Ordinary degree in 1923.

===Early professional years===
After being turned down for a scholarship to go to Trinidad as a farmer, Darlington was encouraged in 1923 by one of his professors to apply for a scholarship at the John Innes Horticultural Institution in Merton. He wrote to its director, William Bateson, famous for having introduced the word &quot;genetics&quot; into biology. His application was unsuccessful, but he obtained a temporary post as an unpaid technician. Bateson had just hired a cytologist, Frank Newton, who became a mentor to Darlington. Darlington published his first scientific paper on the tetraploidy of the sour cherry and was hired as a permanent employee.

Shortly after, both Bateson and Newton died within a year of each other and J.B.S. Haldane came to the Innes. Although neither an experimentalist nor cytologist, Haldane formed a close friendship with Darlington. He began to make contributions to the understanding of the relationship between chromosomal crossover and the events observed during meiosis. 

In February 1929 he made a study trip with fellow botanist John Macqueen Cowan to the Near East. In 1931 he began writing the book &quot;Recent Advances in Cytology,&quot; which was published in 1932. He became Director of the Cytology Department in 1937, and he became director of the Innes two years later, 15 years after his arrival as an unpaid volunteer. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 20 March 1941. A few months after that, he was awarded the Royal Medal, and then was elected president of the Genetical Society. In 1947 he co-founded with Ronald Fisher the journal &quot;&quot;, as a response to J.B.S. Haldane joining the Communist party and &quot;taking the &quot;Journal of Genetics&quot; with him&quot;.

===Later years===
He left the Innes in 1953 and accepted the Sherardian Chair of Botany at Oxford University. He developed an interest in the Botanic Garden, going on to establish the &#x27;Genetic Garden&#x27;. He was also involved in extending the teaching of science, especially genetics, in the university. He continued to voice support for the belief that human genetics determined behaviour.

In 1972 he, along with 50 other scientists, signed &quot;Resolution on Scientific Freedom Regarding Human Behavior and Heredity&quot; in which a genetic approach to understanding the behaviour of man was strongly defended. He staunchly defended his colleague, John Baker, who published the controversial book &quot;Race&quot; in 1974, in the fight against Lysenkoism. Asked by a reporter for The Sunday Times whether or not he was a racist for this connection to John Baker, who believed that no civilizations had ever arisen in Africa, all &quot;negrids&quot; had a &quot;fetid smell&quot; and were &quot;less evolved,&quot; Darlington replied: &quot;Well, I&#x27;m regarded as one by everyone except the Jews, who &quot;are&quot; racist, and who utterly agree with my views.&quot;

Darlington retired from his official position at the University in 1971, but remained in the university, writing and publishing his work. He died in Oxford in 1981. He had five children, two of whom committed suicide.

===Sociobiology and the Lysenko Affair===

In his later years, Darlington increased his participation in the public debate about the role of science in society, and especially its interaction with politics and government. Beginning in 1948, he published strong condemnations of the denouncement of Mendelian genetics in favour of Lysenkoism in the Soviet Union. Some genetics institutes were destroyed, and prominent geneticists were purged or murdered. These events caused an upheaval among the leaders of genetics in the west, many of whom were leftist, socialists, communists, and Marxists. This caused a break between Haldane and Darlington, who was intransigent in his anti-authoritarian views.

Darlington developed an interest in the application of genetic insights to the understanding of human history. He believed that not only were there differences in the character and culture between individuals, but that these differences also exist between races. To him, understanding of these differences in scientific terms was not only interesting in its own right, but was crucial to the development of a civil society. Darlington writes that &quot;as slaves,&quot; enslaved diasporic Africans &quot;improved in health and increased in numbers,&quot; without addressing the role of forced slave breeding in the United States. He repeated the myth that their environment was &quot;more favorable than anything they had experienced in Africa.&quot; According to Darlington, emancipation of slaves resulted in the withdrawal of &quot;discipline&quot; and &quot;protection&quot; resulting in social problems such as &quot;drugs, gambling, and prostitution.&quot;

Darlington concluded: &quot;The intellectually well-endowed races, classes, and societies have a moral responsibility for the problems of race mixture, of immigration and exploitation, that have arisen from their exercise of economic and political power. They may hope to escape from these responsibilities by claiming an intellectual and, therefore, moral equality between all races, classes, and societies. But the chapters of this book, step by step, deprive them of the scientific and historical evidence that might support such a comfortable illusion.&quot;

Darlington was opposed to the UNESCO Statement of Race. He agreed with Darwin&#x27;s classical view: &quot;The races differ also in constitution, in acclimatization, and in liability to certain diseases. Their mental characteristics are likewise very distinct; chiefly as it would appear in their emotional, but partly in their intellectual, faculties.&quot; To simplify, Darlington believed that there is a difference not just in skin color and disease vulnerability between races, but also in intelligence.

Darlington thought that there might be a biological justification to prohibit interracial marriages &quot;if intermarriage were not contrary to the habits of all stable communities and therefore in no need of discouragement.&quot; He refused to sign the revised 1951 statement which conceded that racial differences in intelligence possibly existed. Darlington&#x27;s dissenting commentary was printed with the statement.

<text>Glocalization or glocalisation (a portmanteau of &quot;globalization&quot; and &quot;localism&quot;) is the &quot;simultaneous occurrence of both universalizing and particularizing tendencies in contemporary social, political, and economic systems&quot;. The concept comes from the Japanese word dochakuka and &quot;represents a challenge to simplistic conceptions of globalization processes as linear expansions of territorial scales. Glocalization indicates that the growing importance of continental and global levels is occurring together with the increasing salience of local and regional levels.&quot;

Glocalization represents the fusion of &quot;globalization&quot; and &quot;localization,&quot; emphasizing the need for global entities to tailor their offerings to suit the unique characteristics of individual regions or communities.

Glocal, an adjective, by definition means &quot;reflecting or characterized by both local and global considerations&quot;. The term &quot;glocal management&quot; in a sense of &quot;think globally, act locally&quot; is used in the business strategies of companies, in particular by Japanese companies that are expanding overseas.

==Variety of uses==
*Individuals, households and organizations maintaining interpersonal social networks that combine extensive local and long-distance interactions.
*The declaration of a specified locality – a town, city, or state – as world territory, with responsibilities and rights on a world scale: a process that started in France in 1950 and originally called mundialization.

==History of the concept==
The concept comes from the Japanese word &quot;dochakuka&quot;, which means global localization. It had referred to the adaptation of farming techniques to local conditions. It became a buzzword when Japanese business adopted it in the 1980s. The word stems from Manfred Lange, head of the German National Global Change Secretariat, who used &quot;glocal&quot; in reference to Heiner Benking&#x27;s exhibit &quot;Blackbox Nature: Rubik&#x27;s Cube of Ecology&quot; at an international science and policy conference.

&quot;Glocalization&quot; first appeared in a late 1980s publication of the &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot;. At a 1997 conference on &quot;Globalization and Indigenous Culture&quot;, sociologist Roland Robertson stated that glocalization &quot;means the simultaneity – the co-presence – of both universalizing and particularizing tendencies&quot;.

The term entered use in the English-speaking world via Robertson in the 1990s, Canadian sociologists Keith Hampton and Barry Wellman in the late 1990s and Zygmunt Bauman. Erik Swyngedouw was another early adopter.

Since the 1990s, glocalization has been productively theorized by several sociologists and other social scientists, and may be understood as a process that combines the concerns of localism with the forces of globalization, or a local adaptation and interpretation of global forces. As a theoretical framework, it is compatible with many of the concerns of postcolonial theory, and its impact is particularly recognizable in the digitization of music and other forms of cultural heritage. The concept has since been used in the fields of geography, sociology, and anthropology. It is also a prominent concept in business studies, particularly in the area of marketing goods and services to a heterogenous set of consumers.

== Sociology ==
The concept of glocalization is included in the discourse on social theory. This is first demonstrated in the way it challenges the notion that globalization overrides locality by describing how the concept of local is said to be constructed on a trans- or uper-local basis or is promoted from the outside. There is also the position that the association of temporal and spatial dimensions to human life, which emerge in globalization, exert little impact. Glocalization is also said to capture the emergence of unique new indigenous realities that result in the interpenetration of the global and local spheres. The term ‘glocklization’, combining the glocal concept with a Glock pistol, was coined in 2018 to indicate forms of glocalization that are perceived as unbalanced and destructive to local cultural heritage.

Additionally, the concept of glocalization has strong ties to the more commonly understood term globalization, and has been described as a more general treatment of the term. Elements unique to glocalization under this umbrella include the idea that diversity is the essence of social life, that not all differences are erased, history and culture operate autonomously to offer a sense of uniqueness to the experiences of groups (whether cultures, societies or nations), glocalization removes the fear that globalization resembles a tidal wave erasing all differences, and that glocalization does not promise a world free from conflict but offers a more historically grounded and pragmatic worldview.

===Religion===
Glocalization can be represented throughout virtually every sphere of social society, including religion. An example of this can be seen in a study that focused on the differences in Islam in various regions of the world. In this particular study, observations made between the religious pillars in Indonesia and Morocco indicated a significant difference in religious form between the two, blending the fundamental roots with indigenous traditions and local customs. Similar studies have found that regions of the world practicing Christianity and Buddhism experienced similar shifts based on local cultural practices and norms.

==Business==
While the term &quot;glocalization&quot; is one that developed later in the 20th century, the idea behind it is closely related to the economic and marketing term known as micromarketing – by definition, the &quot;tailoring and advertising of goods and services on a global or near-global basis to increasingly differentiated local and particular markets.&quot;

===Tourism===
Glocalization can be recognized, perhaps most profoundly, in tourism operations throughout the world – particularly in reference to countries in which tour guides and locals are up to date on global pop culture and technology, but still present their communities, heritage, history and culture as distinctively &quot;local.&quot; A notable example is referenced by Professor Noel Salazar of the University of Pennsylvania, whose study dove into these distinctive glocalization attributes on the island of Java in Indonesia.

===Challenges===
Glocalization works best for companies which have decentralized authority. The cost to the companies increases as they cannot standardise products and projects, different cultures have different needs and wants which is highlighted in this challenge. An example of a company succeeding in creating new products for their emerging market is McDonald&#x27;s new rice meals in India and China. This shows that McDonald&#x27;s has done research on and understands their new market&#x27;s requirements for a successful takeaway food. This however can be very costly and time-consuming. One of the main challenges for the future of glocalization is to govern it. Glocal governance is the interlinkage between global, national and local formal and informal actors that aim to find common ground, take decisions, implement and enforce them.

An example of a global business that has faced challenges due to localization of their products can be presented through the closing of a Starbucks in the Forbidden City of China in 2007. Starbucks&#x27; attempt to localize into the culture of China by accommodating their menu to local elements such as serving green tea frappuccinos and enlarging their stores was prevalent in most areas of China, but when Starbucks spread to the Forbidden City, a problem surrounding cultural identity arose. Factors surrounding &quot;western influences&quot; related to Starbucks were seen as a threat by a web-based campaign which was successful in initiating the closing of the Starbucks in the Forbidden City. The leader of this campaign, Rui, stated, &quot;All I want is that Starbucks move out of the Forbidden City peacefully and quietly, and we&#x27;ll continue enjoying Starbucks coffee elsewhere in the city.&quot;

Although there are many challenges to globalisation, when done right it has many benefits; allowing companies to reach a larger target market is just one of them. Society also benefits when globalisation occurs as an increase in market competition generally pushes the price of products down which means the consumers benefit by gaining a lower price point. This decreases the inequality gap as people who couldn&#x27;t previously afford products when the market was controlled by local monopolies are able to purchase the product more cheaply.

Although globalisation has benefits for the consumer, it does not always benefit the producer, with newer and smaller companies struggling to keep up with the low production costs of the multi-national competitors. This results in either a higher price and loss of consumers, or a lower profit margin, which in turn results in less competition within the market.

== Agriculture ==

Glocalization is also occurring within the agricultural sphere. One case brought up by of this has been in soy farming. Previously, there were numerous small-scale soy farms along the east coast of the US. However, as larger corporations outcompeted smaller ones, attentions have been turned abroad. Anthropologist Andrew Ofstehage refers to this change from small, personal farms to large corporate ones as an aspect of &quot;financialization&quot;. Ofstehage expands on this concept by giving the example of the current soy market in Brazil. As financialization has led to land being more expensive and harder to come by in the states, farmers have turned their attention abroad. This farm crisis in the US was a result of increasingly large corporate farms driving out small family farms and acquiring more and more land. Due to this, farmers both new and experienced who are privileged to have capital or investors, have turned their attention abroad. Many have begun to invest in Brazilian land to grow soy with the money from friends, investors, neighbors, or savings. These transnational farmers have had great success but as more farmers have followed these steps the cycle has begun anew. Looking to further expand, farmers often take three paths for further profit and financialization. They either sell their Brazilian farms to a new hopeful farmer, or they keep their farm but return to the states to manage it internationally, or they truly begin anew. Specifically, the farmers sell their Brazilian land and turn Piauí or Tocantins, places where soy grows well, and land is still cheap.

==Education==
Glocalization of education has been proposed in the specific areas of politics, economics, culture, teaching, information, organization, morality, spirituality, religion and &quot;temporal&quot; literacy. The recommended approach is for local educators to consult global resources for materials and techniques and then adapt them for local use. For example, in information, it involves advancing computer and media understanding to allow students and educators to look beyond their local context.

==Media==
Thomas Friedman in &quot;The World Is Flat&quot; talks about how the Internet encourages glocalization, such as encouraging people to make websites in their native languages.

=== Television ===
Besides the usage of Internet, television and commercials have become useful strategies that global companies have used to help localize their products. Companies, such as McDonald&#x27;s, have relied on television and commercials in not only the Western Hemisphere but in other parts of the world to attract a varying range of audiences in accordance with the demographic of the local area. For example, they have used mascots ranging anywhere from a male clown in the Western Hemisphere to attract younger audiences to an &quot;attractive&quot; female clown in Japan to attract older audiences.

=== Video games ===
Some translators of video games favor glocalization over the process of localization in video games. In this context, glocalization seeks from the outset to minimize localization requirements for video games intended to be universally appealing. Academic Douglas Eyman cites the &quot;Mists of Pandaria&quot; expansion for &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; as an example of glocalization because it was designed at the outset to appeal to global audiences while celebrating Chinese culture.

==Community organization==

Glocalization, or glocalism, in community organization refers to community organizing that sees social problems as neither local or global, but interdependent and interconnected (glocal), necessitating organizing practices that concurrently address local problems and global issues. Glocal organizing techniques are commonly associated with The New Community Organizing, and are distinguished from other methods by emphasizing &quot;play, creativity, joy, peer-based popular education, cultural activism, and a healthy dose of experimentation.&quot;

One of the most common glocal models of practice, functional community organization, seeks to organize communities (functional communities) around a function (i.e., a need, interest, or common problem that glocally affects people). Functional community organization emphasizes a deep understanding of issues (e.g., power, empowerment, and community interests), strategies for change (e.g., popular education, direct action, and collaboration), and communication strategies that promote &quot;inclusive networking.&quot; The goals of functional community organization are to organize communities through direct action in order to meet immediate community need while addressing glocalized problems. In so doing, functional communities act as their own unique forms of protest, vehicles for community empowerment, and alternatives to institutionalized social welfare systems. Popular examples of functional communities include community projects such as community gardens, Community Technology Centers, gift economy markets, food sharing, and other forms franchise activism and mutual aid.

<text>Fusel alcohols or fuselol, also sometimes called fusel oils in Europe, are mixtures of several higher alcohols (those with more than two carbons, chiefly amyl alcohol) produced as a by-product of alcoholic fermentation. The word &quot;Fusel&quot; is German for &quot;bad liquor&quot;.

Whether fusel alcohol contributes to hangover symptoms is a matter of scientific debate. A Japanese study in 2003 concluded that &quot;the fusel oil in whisky had no effect on the ethanol-induced emetic response&quot; in the Asian house shrew. Additionally, consumption of fusel oils with ethanol suppressed subjects&#x27; subsequent taste aversion to alcohol, which suggested subjects&#x27; hangover symptoms were lessened, according to the journal.

== Usage ==
Fusel oil and fusel-oil acetates are used in the lacquer industry as high boiling point solvents.

== Compounds ==
Excessive concentrations of some alcohols other than ethanol may cause off-flavors, sometimes described as &quot;spicy&quot;, &quot;hot&quot;, or &quot;solvent-like&quot;. Some beverages, such as rum, whisky (especially bourbon), incompletely rectified vodka (e.g. Siwucha) and traditional ales and ciders, are expected to have relatively high concentrations of non-hazardous alcohols as part of their flavor profile. However, in other beverages, such as Korn, vodka and lagers, the presence of alcohols other than ethanol is considered a fault.

The compounds involved are chiefly the following:

* isoamyl alcohol (isopentanol)
* 2-methyl-1-butanol - sometimes called &quot;active&quot; amyl alcohol
* isobutyl alcohol - one of the least toxic of the butanols.
* 1-propanol

Other higher alcohols that can be produced during fermentation include:

* isopropanol (isopropyl alcohol), oxidized to form acetone by alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver, leading to ketosis when ingested in large quantities.
* 1-butanol
* 1-pentanol (&quot;n&quot;-amyl alcohol)
* 1-hexanol
* 2-phenylethanol
* tyrosol
* tryptophol
* methionol

==Distillation==
During distillation, fusel alcohols are concentrated in the feints or &quot;tails&quot; at the end of the distillation run. They have an oily consistency, which is noticeable to the distiller, hence the other name &quot;fusel oil&quot;. If desired, these heavier alcohols can be almost completely separated in a reflux still. On the other hand, freeze distillation does not remove fusel alcohols.

Fusel alcohols can be reduced during fermentation by lowering the fermenter&#x27;s temperature or increasing the oxygen content.

<text>In quantum mechanics, a quantum operation (also known as quantum dynamical map or [[quantum process]]) is a mathematical formalism used to describe a broad class of transformations that a quantum mechanical system can undergo. This was first discussed as a general stochastic transformation for a density matrix by George Sudarshan. The quantum operation formalism describes not only unitary time evolution or symmetry transformations of isolated systems, but also the effects of measurement and transient interactions with an environment. In the context of quantum computation, a quantum operation is called a quantum channel.

Note that some authors use the term &quot;quantum operation&quot; to refer specifically to completely positive (CP) and non-trace-increasing maps on the space of density matrices, and the term &quot;quantum channel&quot; to refer to the subset of those that are strictly trace-preserving.

Quantum operations are formulated in terms of the density operator description of a quantum mechanical system. Rigorously, a quantum operation is a linear, completely positive map from the set of density operators into itself. In the context of quantum information, one often imposes the further restriction that a quantum operation formula_1 must be &quot;physical&quot;, that is, satisfy formula_2 for any state formula_3.

Some quantum processes cannot be captured within the quantum operation formalism; in principle, the density matrix of a quantum system can undergo completely arbitrary time evolution. Quantum operations are generalized by quantum instruments, which capture the classical information obtained during measurements, in addition to the quantum information.

== Background ==

The Schrödinger picture provides a satisfactory account of time evolution of state for a quantum mechanical system under certain assumptions. These assumptions include

* The system is non-relativistic
* The system is isolated.

The Schrödinger picture for time evolution has several mathematically equivalent formulations. One such formulation expresses the time rate of change of the state via the Schrödinger equation. A more suitable formulation for this exposition is expressed as follows:

This means that if the system is in a state corresponding to &quot;v&quot; ∈ &quot;H&quot; at an instant of time &quot;s&quot;, then the state after &quot;t&quot; units of time will be &quot;U&quot;&quot;t&quot; &quot;v&quot;. For relativistic systems, there is no universal time parameter, but we can still formulate the effect of certain reversible transformations on the quantum mechanical system. For instance, state transformations relating observers in different frames of reference are given by unitary transformations. In any case, these state transformations carry pure states into pure states; this is often formulated by saying that in this idealized framework, there is no decoherence.

For interacting (or open) systems, such as those undergoing measurement, the situation is entirely different. To begin with, the state changes experienced by such systems cannot be accounted for exclusively by a transformation on the set of pure states (that is, those associated to vectors of norm 1 in &quot;H&quot;). After such an interaction, a system in a pure state φ may no longer be in the pure state φ. In general it will be in a statistical mix of a sequence of pure states φ1, ..., φ&quot;k&quot; with respective probabilities λ1, ..., λ&quot;k&quot;. The transition from a pure state to a mixed state is known as decoherence.

Numerous mathematical formalisms have been established to handle the case of an interacting system. The quantum operation formalism emerged around 1983 from work of Karl Kraus, who relied on the earlier mathematical work of Man-Duen Choi. It has the advantage that it expresses operations such as measurement as a mapping from density states to density states. In particular, the effect of quantum operations stays within the set of density states.

== Definition ==

Recall that a density operator is a non-negative operator on a Hilbert space with unit trace.

Mathematically, a quantum operation is a linear map Φ between spaces of trace class operators on Hilbert spaces &quot;H&quot; and &quot;G&quot; such that
* If &quot;S&quot; is a density operator, Tr(Φ(&quot;S&quot;)) ≤ 1.
* Φ is completely positive, that is for any natural number &quot;n&quot;, and any square matrix of size &quot;n&quot; whose entries are trace-class operators formula_4 and which is non-negative, then formula_5 is also non-negative. In other words, Φ is completely positive if formula_6 is positive for all &quot;n&quot;, where formula_7 denotes the identity map on the C*-algebra of formula_8 matrices.

Note that, by the first condition, quantum operations may not preserve the normalization property of statistical ensembles. In probabilistic terms, quantum operations may be sub-Markovian. In order that a quantum operation preserve the set of density matrices, we need the additional assumption that it is trace-preserving.

In the context of quantum information, the quantum operations defined here, i.e. completely positive maps that do not increase the trace, are also called quantum channels or &quot;stochastic maps&quot;. The formulation here is confined to channels between quantum states; however, it can be extended to include classical states as well, therefore allowing quantum and classical information to be handled simultaneously.

== Kraus operators ==
Kraus″ theorem (named after Karl Kraus) characterizes completely positive maps, which model quantum operations between quantum states. Informally, the theorem ensures that the action of any such quantum operation formula_9 on a state formula_3 can always be written as formula_11, for some set of operators formula_12 satisfying formula_13, where formula_14 is the identity operator.

=== Statement of the theorem ===
Theorem. Let formula_15 and formula_16 be Hilbert spaces of dimension formula_17 and formula_18 respectively, and formula_9 be a quantum operation between formula_15 and formula_16. Then, there are matrices formula_22 mapping formula_15 to formula_16 such that, for any state formula_25, formula_26
Conversely, any map formula_27 of this form is a quantum operation provided formula_13.

The matrices formula_29 are called &quot;Kraus operators&quot;. (Sometimes they are known as &quot;noise operators&quot; or &quot;error operators&quot;, especially in the context of quantum information processing, where the quantum operation represents the noisy, error-producing effects of the environment.) The Stinespring factorization theorem extends the above result to arbitrary separable Hilbert spaces &quot;H&quot; and &quot;G&quot;. There, &quot;S&quot; is replaced by a trace class operator and formula_29 by a sequence of bounded operators.

===Unitary equivalence===
Kraus matrices are not uniquely determined by the quantum operation formula_9 in general. For example, different Cholesky factorizations of the Choi matrix might give different sets of Kraus operators. The following theorem states that all systems of Kraus matrices representing the same quantum operation are related by a unitary transformation:

Theorem. Let formula_9 be a (not necessarily trace-preserving) quantum operation on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space &quot;H&quot; with two representing sequences of Kraus matrices formula_33 and formula_34. Then there is a unitary operator matrix formula_35 such that formula_36

In the infinite-dimensional case, this generalizes to a relationship between two minimal Stinespring representations.

It is a consequence of Stinespring&#x27;s theorem that all quantum operations can be implemented by unitary evolution after coupling a suitable ancilla to the original system.

===Remarks===
These results can be also derived from Choi&#x27;s theorem on completely positive maps, characterizing a completely positive finite-dimensional map by a unique Hermitian-positive density operator (Choi matrix) with respect to the trace. Among all possible Kraus representations of a given channel, there exists a canonical form distinguished by the orthogonality relation of Kraus operators, formula_37. Such canonical set of orthogonal Kraus operators can be obtained by diagonalising the corresponding Choi matrix and reshaping its eigenvectors into square matrices.

There also exists an infinite-dimensional algebraic generalization of Choi&#x27;s theorem, known as &quot;Belavkin&#x27;s Radon-Nikodym theorem for completely positive maps&quot;, which defines a density operator as a &quot;Radon–Nikodym derivative&quot; of a quantum channel with respect to a dominating completely positive map (reference channel). It is used for defining the relative fidelities and mutual informations for quantum channels.

==Dynamics==
For a non-relativistic quantum mechanical system, its time evolution is described by a one-parameter group of automorphisms {α&quot;t&quot;}&quot;t&quot; of &quot;Q&quot;. This can be narrowed to unitary transformations: under certain weak technical conditions (see the article on quantum logic and the Varadarajan reference), there is a strongly continuous one-parameter group {&quot;U&quot;&quot;t&quot;}&quot;t&quot; of unitary transformations of the underlying Hilbert space such that the elements &quot;E&quot; of &quot;Q&quot; evolve according to the formula
:formula_38
The system time evolution can also be regarded dually as time evolution of the statistical state space. The evolution of the statistical state is given by a family of operators {β&quot;t&quot;}&quot;t&quot; 
such that
formula_39

Clearly, for each value of &quot;t&quot;, &quot;S&quot; → &quot;U&quot;*&quot;t&quot; &quot;S&quot; &quot;U&quot;&quot;t&quot; is a quantum operation. Moreover, this operation is &quot;reversible&quot;.

This can be easily generalized: If &quot;G&quot; is a connected Lie group of symmetries of &quot;Q&quot; satisfying the same weak continuity conditions, then the action of any element &quot;g&quot; of &quot;G&quot; is given by a unitary operator &quot;U&quot;:
formula_40
This mapping &quot;g&quot; → &quot;U&quot;&quot;g&quot; is known as a projective representation of &quot;G&quot;. The mappings &quot;S&quot; → &quot;U&quot;*&quot;g&quot; &quot;S&quot; &quot;U&quot;&quot;g&quot; are reversible quantum operations.

==Quantum measurement==
Quantum operations can be used to describe the process of quantum measurement. The presentation below describes measurement in terms of self-adjoint projections on a separable complex Hilbert space &quot;H&quot;, that is, in terms of a PVM (Projection-valued measure). In the general case, measurements can be made using non-orthogonal operators, via the notions of POVM. The non-orthogonal case is interesting, as it can improve the overall efficiency of the quantum instrument.

=== Binary measurements ===
Quantum systems may be measured by applying a series of &quot;yes–no questions&quot;. This set of questions can be understood to be chosen from an orthocomplemented lattice &quot;Q&quot; of propositions in quantum logic. The lattice is equivalent to the space of self-adjoint projections on a separable complex Hilbert space &quot;H&quot;.

Consider a system in some state &quot;S&quot;, with the goal of determining whether it has some property &quot;E&quot;, where &quot;E&quot; is an element of the lattice of quantum &quot;yes-no&quot; questions. Measurement, in this context, means submitting the system to some procedure to determine whether the state satisfies the property. The reference to system state, in this discussion, can be given an operational meaning by considering a statistical ensemble of systems. Each measurement yields some definite value 0 or 1; moreover application of the measurement process to the ensemble results in a predictable change of the statistical state. This transformation of the statistical state is given by the quantum operation
formula_41
Here &quot;E&quot; can be understood to be a projection operator.

===General case===
In the general case, measurements are made on observables taking on more than two values.

When an observable &quot;A&quot; has a pure point spectrum, it can be written in terms of an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors. That is, &quot;A&quot; has a spectral decomposition
formula_42
where E&quot;A&quot;(λ) is a family of pairwise orthogonal projections, each onto the respective eigenspace of &quot;A&quot; associated with the measurement value λ.

Measurement of the observable &quot;A&quot; yields an eigenvalue of &quot;A&quot;. Repeated measurements, made on a statistical ensemble &quot;S&quot; of systems, results in a probability distribution over the eigenvalue spectrum of &quot;A&quot;. It is a discrete probability distribution, and is given by
formula_43

Measurement of the statistical state &quot;S&quot; is given by the map
formula_44
That is, immediately after measurement, the statistical state is a classical distribution over the eigenspaces associated with the possible values λ of the observable: &quot;S&quot; is a mixed state.

==Non-completely positive maps==

Shaji and Sudarshan argued in a Physical Review Letters paper that, upon close examination, complete positivity is not a requirement for a good representation of open quantum evolution. Their calculations show that, when starting with some fixed initial correlations between the observed system and the environment, the map restricted to the system itself is not necessarily even positive. However, it is not positive only for those states that do not satisfy the assumption about the form of initial correlations. Thus, they show that to get a full understanding of quantum evolution, non completely-positive maps should be considered as well.

<text>The Paramount Theatre is a 3,040-seat Art Deco concert hall located at 2025 Broadway in Downtown Oakland. When it was built in 1931, it was the largest multi-purpose theater on the West Coast, seating 3,476. Today, the Paramount is the home of the Oakland East Bay Symphony and the Oakland Ballet. It regularly plays host to R&amp;B, jazz, blues, pop, rock, gospel, classical music, as well as ballets, plays, stand-up comedy, lecture series, special events, and screenings of classic movies from Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Era.

==History==
The Paramount Theatre was built as a movie palace, during the rise of the motion picture industry in the late 1920s. In 1925, Adolph Zukor&#x27;s Paramount Publix Corporation, the theater division of Paramount Pictures, one of the great studio-theater chains, began a construction program resulting in some of the finest theaters built. Publix assigned the design of the Oakland Paramount to 38-year-old San Francisco architect Timothy L. Pflueger (1892–1946) of Miller and Pflueger. The Paramount opened at a cost of $3 million on December 16, 1931. Pflueger was also the designer of the Castro Theatre in San Francisco. The Art Deco design referred to the &quot;1925 Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes&quot; in Paris. The term Art Deco has been used only since the late 1960s, when there was a revival of interest in the art and fashion of the early 20th century.

The Paramount organ was built by Wurlitzer for the Paramount Publix theaters: a four-manual, twenty-rank model called the Publix I (Opus 2164), which cost $20,000 in 1931.

The gala premiere on December 16, 1931, was attended by Kay Francis, star of the opening film, &quot;The False Madonna&quot;, and cast members Conway Tearle, Charles D. Brown, Marjorie Gateson, and William Boyd (not yet known as Hopalong Cassidy). Notable guests included California&#x27;s governor James Rolph and Oakland mayor Fred N. Morcom. Tickets were first-come, first-served: sixty cents for the balcony seat and eighty-five cents for a seat in the orchestra. The program also included a Fox Movietone News newsreel, a Silly Symphony animated cartoon &quot;The Spider and the Fly&quot;, and the music of the Paramount&#x27;s own 16-piece house orchestra, under the direction of Lew Kosloff. Last on the program was the stage show Fanchon &amp; Marco&#x27;s &quot;Slavique Idea&quot;, a forty-minute revue featuring Sam Hearn, comedians Brock and Thompson, dancer LaVonne Sweet, the acrobatic Seven Arconis, Patsy Marr, and the Sunkist Beauties in a chorus-line finale.

In June 1932 the Paramount closed, unable to meet operating expenses of more than $27,000 per week. Competing with Paramount was the Fox Oakland Theater, which had opened in 1928. The Paramount stayed closed for nearly a year. The days when movie theaters could support not just the showing of movies, but entire orchestras, stage shows, and uniformed attendants, were over, just as the Paramount was being completed. When it reopened in May 1933, it was under the management of Frank Burhans, the manager of the Warfield Theatre in San Francisco. He was commissioned to get the Paramount out of debt, and his method for achieving this was to operate without either a stage show or an orchestra, and to unscrew light bulbs in an effort to reduce energy expenses. The Paramount showed the best of the new motion pictures, including such features as &quot;Dancing Lady&quot; (1933) with Joan Crawford and Clark Gable, &quot;Dames&quot; (1934) with Dick Powell, and &quot;The Gay Divorcee&quot; (1934) with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The Great Depression gave way to World War II, and the Port of Oakland became a major departure and arrival point for servicemen. The Paramount&#x27;s comfortable chairs and spacious lounges were a favorite gathering place. In the 1950s, popcorn machines and candy counters were installed, and on the lobby walls the incandescent lights were taken out and replaced by neon tubing in red and blue. In 1953, it played the first CinemaScope movie &quot;The Robe&quot; with Richard Burton and Jean Simmons. The 1957 Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; attracted a thousand young people. At the end of the 1950s theaters were losing patrons to television, but the Paramount management responded with talent shows, prize nights, and advertising campaigns.

For a second time the Paramount closed on September 15, 1970, because it no longer was able to compete with smaller movie theaters in the suburbs. The Paramount&#x27;s last film was &quot;Let It Be&quot; (1970) with The Beatles. In 1971, a Warner Bros. movie, &quot;The Candidate&quot;, starring Robert Redford, was filmed using the interior of the Paramount as one of the principal locations.

Hope surfaced in October 1972 when the Oakland Symphony Orchestra Association (OSO), in need of a new home, purchased the Paramount for $1 million, half of which was donated by the seller, National General Theaters—formerly the Fox Theaters-West Coast—with the other half coming from generous private donors. The popcorn machines and candy counters were removed. With the help of restoration project manager Peter Botto, new, wider seats were installed, the distance between rows was increased to provide more leg room, and a replica of the original carpet was laid throughout the theater. Two bars, one on the mezzanine and one on the lower level, and a new box office were added. Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill were consultants for the restoration, with Milton Pflueger &amp; Associates assisting. The Paramount reopened on September 22, 1973, in its original 1931 splendor. Following the Opening the Oakland Symphony had sold out nearly all seats on subscription sales and sold out a majority of individual concerts.

But even with the house full the Paramount Theatre proved a financial burden to the Oakland Symphony. In addition the Oakland Symphony financed renovation costs with a $1 million loan. Rather than continue absorbing the Paramount&#x27;s operating losses, the Oakland Symphony transferred the Paramount to the City of Oakland in 1975 for $1 in exchange for 40 years of free rent. They continued with that agreement until the Oakland Symphony Orchestra filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September 1986.

Seeing an opportunity, a group of seven private citizens banded together and approached city officials with the idea of managing and operating the Paramount on behalf of the city as a nonprofit organization. They agreed, and the management structure has remained to this day.

Walking into the main lobby, with its gold ornamentation along the walls, curving staircase, and glowing light fixtures, is like taking a trip back through Old Hollywood. Public tours of the Paramount Theatre are given on the first and third Saturdays of each month, excluding holidays and holiday weekends. Documented in 1972 by the Historic American Buildings Survey, the theater was entered into the National Register of Historic Places on August 14, 1973, and became a California Registered Historical Landmark in 1976 and a U.S. National Historical Landmark in 1977.

Michael Morgan was music director from September 1990 until his death in August 2021. With its May 18, 2007, performance of George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; sold out, the Oakland East Bay Symphony opened its final rehearsal to the public.

In December 2007, the Oakland Ballet celebrated the 35th anniversary of Ronn Guidi&#x27;s &quot;Nutcracker&quot; at the Paramount Theatre, with Michael Morgan conducting the music of Tchaikovsky.

===Classic movie nights===

It wasn&#x27;t until 1987 that the Paramount returned to its true calling as a movie house, showing Buster Keaton&#x27;s &quot;The General&quot; (1926), a silent film accompanied by the Wurlitzer. In 1988, &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942), starring Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, launched the first movie series. The 2002 feature was Peter Sellers in &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; (1964).

In 2002 it showed &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939), with Judy Garland, and in 2004 the Paramount showed several classic movies: &quot;Harvey&quot; (1950), starring James Stewart, &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; (1964) starring Elvis Presley and Ann-Margret, &quot;The Graduate&quot; (1967) with Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft, and &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; (1952) starring Kirk Douglas and Lana Turner.

The Paramount Movie Classics series continues scheduling screenings throughout the year and is enthusiastically supported by guests and staff members alike who often dress up in costume as movie characters.

===Other===
In order to accommodate the large number of people attending on the High Holy Days, since 2001 Oakland&#x27;s Temple Sinai has held its main High Holy Day services at the Paramount, filling the entire 1,800 seats on the mezzanine of the theater, and most of the 1,200 seats in the balcony.

===Notable events===
The Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame was founded in 1973 in Oakland. They held elegant events that honored such screen legends as Clarence Muse, Hattie McDaniel, Billy Dee Williams, Melvin Van Peebles, and Danny Glover with the Oscar Micheaux Awards. Some of the events were hosted at Oakland&#x27;s Paramount Theatre. In 2001 Harry Belafonte, Eubie Blake and Diahann Carroll was inducted in the Filmmakers Hall of Fame at the Paramount.

1995 – Poet Maya Angelou read from her work at a benefit at Paramount for the St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal School.

1999 – Actress Halle Berry was at the Paramount for the premiere of &quot;Introducing Dorothy Dandridge&quot;, an HBO docudrama.

2007 – Former Congressman Ron Dellums was sworn in on Monday, January 8, as Oakland&#x27;s 48th mayor in a public ceremony at the Paramount Theatre. A crowd of 1,900 people gathered for the ceremony.

2011 – Hosting of the premiere for the 2011 film &quot;Moneyball&quot;. The cast as well as some Oakland Athletics players and executives attended the premiere.

2012 – Abel Gance&#x27;s film &quot;Napoléon&quot; had four screenings from March 24 to April 1 as part of the San Francisco Silent Film Festival. Accompanied by a live orchestra, &quot;Napoléon&quot; was shown at the original 20 frames per second and ending with a 20-minute final triptych sequence. These, the first US screenings of British film historian Kevin Brownlow&#x27;s 5.5-hour-long restored version, were described as requiring three intermissions, one of which was a dinner break. Score arranger Carl Davis led the 46-piece Oakland East Bay Symphony for the performances.

<text>Merrill De Maris (February 26, 1898, New Jersey – December 31, 1948, Escondido, California) was an American writer who worked on Disney comic strips for King Features Syndicate.

De Maris helped Floyd Gottfredson with many of his early &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; comic strips; they co-created famous characters like Phantom Blot, Chief O&#x27;Hara and Detective Casey. In 1942, they gave Minnie Mouse a full name as Minerva Mouse, for the four-month comic strip story &quot;The Gleam&quot;.

De Maris also wrote for the &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; comic strip from December 1937 to October 1942, writing the comic strip adaptations of the feature films &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, &quot;Pinocchio&quot; and &quot;Bambi&quot;.

In 1943, De Maris abandoned a half-finished outline for a Donald Duck comic book story. The publisher gave the outline to Carl Barks, who polished it, made it longer, and published it as &quot;Too Many Pets&quot;, in &quot;Donald Duck Four Color&quot; #29 (Sept 1943).

<doc id="666133" wikidata="Q2064047" url="?curid=666133" title="Home insurance">
<text>Home insurance, also commonly called homeowner&#x27;s insurance (often abbreviated in the US real estate industry as HOI), is a type of property insurance that covers a private residence. It is an insurance policy that combines various personal insurance protections, which can include losses occurring to one&#x27;s home, its contents, loss of use (additional living expenses), or loss of other personal possessions of the homeowner, as well as liability insurance for accidents that may happen at the home or at the hands of the homeowner within the policy territory.

Additionally, homeowner&#x27;s insurance provides financial protection against disasters. A standard home insurance policy covers the home and the belongings inside it.

== Overview ==
Homeowner&#x27;s policy is a multiple-line insurance policy, meaning that it includes both property insurance and liability coverage, with an indivisible premium, meaning that a single premium is paid for all risks. This means that it covers damage to one&#x27;s property and liability for any injuries and property damage caused by the owner or members of his/her family to other people. It may also include damage caused by household pets. The U.S. uses standardized policy forms that divide coverage into several categories. Coverage limits are typically provided as a percentage of the primary Coverage A, which is coverage for the main dwelling.

The cost of homeowner&#x27;s insurance often depends on what it would cost to replace the house and which additional endorsements or riders are attached to the policy. The insurance policy is a legal contract between the insurance carrier (insurance company) and the named insured(s). It is a contract of indemnity and will put the insured back to their state before the loss. Typically, claims due to floods or war (whose definition typically includes a nuclear explosion from any source) are excluded from coverage, amongst other standard exclusions (like termites). Special insurance, including flood insurance, can be purchased for these possibilities. Insurance is adjusted to reflect the replacement cost, usually upon applying an inflation factor or a cost index.

=== Pricing ===

Major factors in price estimation include location, coverage, and the amount of insurance, which is based on the estimated cost to rebuild the home (&quot;replacement cost&quot;).

If insufficient coverage is purchased to rebuild the home, the claim&#x27;s payout may be subject to a co-insurance penalty. In this scenario, the insured will be subject to an out-of-pocket fee as a penalty. Insurers use vendors to estimate the costs, including CoreLogic subsidiary Marshall Swift-Boeckh, Verisk PropertyProfile, and E2Value, but leave the responsibility ultimately up to the consumer. In 2013, a survey found that about 60% of homes are undervalued by an estimated 17 percent. In some cases, estimates can be too low because of &quot;demand surge&quot; after a catastrophe. As a safeguard against a wrong estimate, some insurers offer &quot;extended replacement cost&quot; add-ons (&quot;endorsements&quot;) which provide extra coverage if the limit is reached.

Prices may be lower if the house is situated next to a fire station or is equipped with fire sprinklers and fire alarms; if the house exhibits wind mitigation measures, such as hurricane shutters; or if the house has a security system and has insurer-approved locks installed.

Typically payment is made annually. Perpetual insurance, which continues indefinitely, can also be obtained in certain areas.

===Covered perils===
Home insurance offers coverage on a &quot;named perils&quot; and &quot;open perils&quot; basis. A &quot;named perils&quot; policy is one that provides coverage for a loss specifically listed on the policy; if it&#x27;s not listed, then it&#x27;s not covered. An &quot;open perils&quot; policy is broader in the sense that it will provide coverage for all losses except those expressly excluded from the policy.

For insurance policies that cover specific named perils, the insurer frequently offers a choice between one policy covering a basic set of specific perils and another covering the same basic set plus several additional perils, as discussed below. Together with an open peril, a.k.a. &quot;special form&quot; policy, these two groupings of named perils allow the insurer to offer a choice among three types of policy, with three levels of coverage, which can be priced in a fair and accurate manner and appeal to a variety of resident homeowners as well as owners of apartment buildings and condominium associations.

Basic &quot;named perils&quot; – this is the least comprehensive of the three coverage options. It provides protection against perils most likely to result in a total loss. It is not covered if something happens to the home that&#x27;s not on the list below. This type of policy is most common in countries with developing insurance markets and as protection for vacant or unoccupied buildings.

Basic-form covered perils:
* Fire
* Lightning
* Windstorm or hail
* Explosion
* Smoke
* Vandalism
* Aircraft or vehicle collision
* Riot or civil commotion

Broad &quot;named perils&quot; – this form expands on the &quot;basic form&quot; by adding 6 more covered perils. Again, this is a &quot;named perils&quot; policy. The loss must specifically be listed to receive coverage. Fortunately, the &quot;broad form&quot; is designed to cover the most common forms of property damage.

Broad-form covered perils:
* All basic-form perils
* Burglary, break-in damage
* Falling objects (e.g. tree limbs)
* Weight of ice and snow
* Freezing of plumbing
* Accidental water damage
* Artificially generated electricity

Special &quot;all risk&quot; – special-form coverage is the most inclusive of the three options. The difference with &quot;special form&quot; policies is that they cover all losses unless specifically excluded. Unlike the prior forms, all unlisted perils are covered perils. However, if something happens to the home, and the event is on the exclusions list, the policy will not provide coverage.

Special-form excluded perils:
* Ordinance of law
* Earthquake
* Flood
* Power failure
* Neglect
* War
* Nuclear hazard
* Intentional acts

== In the United States ==

In the United States, most home buyers borrow money in the form of a mortgage loan, and the mortgage lender often requires that the buyer purchase homeowner&#x27;s insurance as a condition of the loan, in order to protect the bank if the home is destroyed. Anyone with an insurable interest in the property should be listed on the policy. In some cases the mortgagee will waive the need for the mortgagor to carry homeowner&#x27;s insurance if the value of the land exceeds the amount of the mortgage balance. In such a case even the total destruction of any buildings would not affect the ability of the lender to be able to foreclose and recover the full amount of the loan.

Home insurance in the United States may differ from other countries; for example, in Britain, subsidence and subsequent foundation failure is usually covered under an insurance policy. United States insurance companies used to offer foundation insurance, which was reduced to coverage for damage due to leaks, and finally eliminated altogether. The insurance is often misunderstood by its purchasers; for example, many believe that mold is covered when it is not a standard coverage.

=== History ===
The first homeowner&#x27;s policy &quot;per se&quot; in the United States was introduced in September 1950, but similar policies had already existed in Great Britain and certain areas of the United States. In the late 1940s, US insurance law was reformed and during this process multiple line statutes were written, allowing homeowner&#x27;s policies to become legal.

Prior to the 1950s there were separate policies for the various perils that could affect a home. A homeowner would have had to purchase separate policies covering fire losses, theft, personal property, and the like. During the 1950s policy forms were developed allowing the homeowner to purchase all the insurance they needed on one complete policy. However, these policies varied by insurance company, and were difficult to comprehend.

The need for standardization grew so great that a private company based in Jersey City, New Jersey, Insurance Services Office, also known as the ISO, was formed in 1971 to provide risk information and it issued simplified homeowner&#x27;s policy forms for reselling to insurance companies. These policies have been amended over the years.

Modern developments have changed the insurance coverage terms, availability, and pricing. Homeowner&#x27;s insurance has been relatively unprofitable, due in part to catastrophes such as hurricanes as well as regulators&#x27; reluctance to authorize price increases. Coverages have been reduced instead and companies have diverged from the former standardized model ISO forms. Water damage due to burst pipes in particular has been restricted or in some cases entirely eliminated. Other restrictions included time limits, complex replacement cost calculations (which may not reflect the true cost to replace), and reductions in wind damage coverage.

=== Types of homeowners insurance policies ===

According to a 2018 National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) report on data from 2016, 73.8% of homes were covered by owner-occupied homeowners&#x27; policies. Of these, 79.52% had an HO-3 Special policy, and 13.35% had the more expensive HO-5 Comprehensive. Both of these policies are &quot;all risks&quot; or &quot;open perils&quot;, meaning that they cover all perils except those specifically excluded. Homes covered by an HO-2 Broad policy accounted for 5.15%, which covers only specific named perils. The remaining 2% includes the HO-1 Basic and the HO-8 Modified policies, which are the most limited in the coverage offered. HO-8, also known as older home insurance, is likely to pay only actual cash value for damages rather than replacement.

The remaining 21.3% of home insurance policies were covered by renter&#x27;s or condominium insurance. 14.8% of these had the HO-4 Contents Broad form, also known as renters&#x27; insurance, which covers the contents of an apartment not specifically covered in the blanket policy written for the complex. This policy can also cover liability arising from injury to guests as well as negligence of the renter within the coverage territory. Common coverage areas are events such as lightning, riot, aircraft, explosion, vandalism, smoke, theft, windstorm or hail, falling objects, volcanic eruption, snow, sleet, and weight of ice. The remainder had the HO-6 Unit-Owners policy, also known as a condominium insurance, which is designed for the owners of condos and includes coverage for the part of the building owned by the insured and for the property housed therein. Designed to span the gap between the coverage provided by the blanket policy written for the entire neighborhood or building and the personal property inside the home. The condominium association&#x27;s by-laws may determine the total amount of insurance necessary. E.g., in Florida, the scope of coverage is prescribed by statute – 718.111(11)(f).

=== Collateral protection insurance ===
If a home can not be insured, obtaining a mortgage on it is difficult or impossible. If the homeowner&#x27;s insurance is canceled after a mortgage agreement is in force, and the home judged to be uninsurable, a standard mortgage contract that compels homeowner&#x27;s insurance allows the lender to purchase collateral protection insurance, (sometimes called &quot;force-placed insurance&quot;) and charge the premiums to the homeowner via escrow. CPI&#x27;s pay off the balance owed on the mortgage if the homeowner defaults on mortgage payments, and some will cover damage to the home that impacts the resale value. This repair coverage can benefit the homeowner, but by design the contractual benefits flow to the mortgagee. If the structure is deemed uninsurable, the homeowner also benefits from not having the mortgage called in by the lender - without CPI the homeowner would be in serious breach of his contractual obligations.

=== Causes of loss ===
According to the 2008 Insurance Information Institute factbook, for every $100 of premium, in 2005 on average $16 went to fire and lightning, $30 to wind and hail, $11 to water damage and freezing, $4 for other causes, and $2 for theft. An additional $3 went to liability and medical payments and $9 for claims settlement expenses, and the remaining $25 was allocated to insurer expenses. One study of fires found that most were caused by heating incidents, although smoking was a risk factor for fatal fires.

=== Claims process ===
After a loss, the insured is expected to take steps to mitigate the loss. Insurance policies typically require the insurer to be notified within a reasonable period. After that, a claims adjuster will investigate the claim, and the insured may be required to provide various information.

Filing a claim may result in an increase in rates, nonrenewal, or cancellation. In addition, insurers may share the claim data in an industry database (the two major ones are CLUE and A-PLUS), with Claim Loss Underwriting Exchange (CLUE) by Choicepoint receiving data from 98% of U.S. insurers.

=== Cost impact of weather disasters ===

According to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), damages from weather-related disasters in the United States amounted to approximately $92.9 billion in 2023. Over recent years, these events&#x27; increasing frequency and severity have impacted the insurance industry. 

From 2020 to 2023, insurance costs rose by 13 percent, influenced by several factors. Notably, areas frequently affected by disasters have seen higher insurance premiums. A key contributor to these rising costs is increased reinsurance expenses. Reinsurance, which is insurance purchased by insurance companies to mitigate their own risk, saw its costs double from 2017 to 2023. For the fifth consecutive year, these companies have incurred more in payouts than they collected in premiums. In 2023, insurers disbursed $1.11 in claims for every dollar received in premiums, indicating a financial strain within the home insurance sector.

== In the United Kingdom ==

As in the US, mortgage lenders within the United Kingdom (UK) require the rebuild value (the actual cost of rebuilding a property to its current state should it be damaged or destroyed) of a property to be covered as a condition of the loan. However, the rebuild cost is often lower than the market value of the property, as the market value often reflects the property as a going concern, as opposed to just the value of the bricks and mortar.

A number of factors, such as an increase in fraud and increasingly unpredictable weather, have seen home insurance premiums continue to rise in the UK. For this reason, there has been a shift in how home insurance is bought in the UK—as customers become a lot more price-sensitive, there has been a large increase in the amount of policies sold through price comparison sites.

In addition to standard home insurance, some 8 million households in the UK are categorized as being a &quot;non-standard&quot; risk. These households require a specialist or non-standard insurer that would cover home insurance needs for people that have criminal convictions and/or where the property suffers subsidence or has previously been underpinned.

== Around the world ==
Premium volume by country (2013)
Building and contents coverage

Countries such as China, Australia, and the United Kingdom use a more straightforward approach to home insurance, called &quot;building and contents coverage&quot; commonly referred to as &quot;home and contents insurance&quot;. Relative to the insurance policies of the United States, building and contents coverage offers a very basic level of coverage. Most standard policies only cover the most basic perils listed below:
* Storm or flood
* Fire
* Lightning or explosion
* Falling trees or branches
* Subsidence, drag or landslip
* Breakage of glass or sanitary fittings
* Damage from escaped water or oil
* Shock caused to the house by animals, vehicles or aircraft

Building coverage

Building covers both the primary structure as well as detached structures such as garages, sheds, and back houses that are on property. However, different insurers may not cover things like boundary walls, fences, gates, paths, drives or swimming pools, so it is important to check the specific policy language. This is an equivalent of both Coverage A and B in homeowners insurance policies in the United States.

Contents coverage

Contents insurance covers personal effects such as furniture, clothes, electronics, jewelry, etc. Most policies limit the individual amount of money paid out for each category of items. Individual policies can vary in the amount of coverage they provide. The option to schedule personal property is readily available.

Liability coverage

Liability is typically bundled together with building and contents coverage. Injuries and damage on premises would be covered by building coverage liability while any offsite occurrences would be covered under contents coverage.

Common exclusions

As with most insurance policies, there are always exclusions. The most common are:
* General wear-and-tear maintenance
* Faulty workmanship
* Mechanical or electrical breakdown
* Any amount over the limits shown on the policy schedule or in the policy
* Restricted cover when the home is empty or is let to tenants

<text>William Gordon Cornwallis Eliot, 4th Earl of St Germans (14 December 1829 – 19 March 1881), known as Lord Eliot from 1864 to 1877, was a British diplomat and Liberal politician. He was also a president of the Church of England Society for the Maintenance of the Faith.

==Life and career==
Eliot was born at Port Eliot, Cornwall, the third but eldest surviving son of Edward Granville Eliot, 3rd Earl of St Germans, and his wife Jemima (née Cornwallis). He was educated at Eton College and then joined the Diplomatic Service. His assignments included:

* Attaché at Hanover from 1849 to 1853
* Attaché at Lisbon from 1851 to 1853
* 2nd Paid Attaché at Berlin from 1853 to 1857
* 1st Paid Attaché at Constantinople from 1857 to 1858
* 1st Paid Attaché at Saint Petersburg from 1858 to 1859
* Secretary of Legation at Rio de Janeiro in 1859
* Secretary of Legation at Athens from 1859 to 1861
* Secretary of Legation at Lisbon from 1860 to 1861 
* Chargé d&#x27;Affaires at Rio de Janeiro from 1861 to 1863
* Acting Secretary of Legation at Washington, D.C. from 1863 to 1864

He resigned in 1865 and was elected Member of Parliament for Devonport in 1866, a seat he held until 1868. In 1870 he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Eliot. Lord St Germans died unmarried in March 1881, aged 51 and is buried, near his mother, at Kensal Green Cemetery. He was succeeded by his younger brother, Henry.

<text>Carl Robert Fallberg (September 11, 1915 – May 9, 1996) was a writer/cartoonist for animated feature films and TV cartoons for Disney Studios, Hanna-Barbera, and Warner Brothers. He also wrote comic books for Dell Comics, Western Publishing, and Gold Key Comics.

==Early life==
Carl Robert Fallberg was born in Cleveland, Tennessee on 11 September 1915 to Carl Fallberg (Sr.), and Gunhild Fallberg (née Sjöstedt), who both taught music at the Centenary College Conservatory in Cleveland, Tennessee from 1910 to 1917. Carl was the middle child of three, with an older sister Lisa Lina &quot;Dixie&quot; and younger sister Elinor Faith. The family moved to Chicago, and in 1930 his mother died, leaving Carl and his two sisters motherless for several years.

Carl attended Nicholas Senn High School in Chicago, Illinois. In 1934, Carl sent a letter with samples of his gag ideas and artwork to Walt Disney asking for employment. On the third try, he was offered a job and started to work for Walt Disney Studios in 1935 (then located at 2719 Hyperion Avenue in Hollywood, California.)

Carl and his sister Elinor (1923-2014) lived in rooming house at 3021 Angus Street, just a few blocks from the Hyperion Studios. It was there he meet his future wife, Becky Dorner, the daughter of the family who owned the rooming house. During World War II, his sister Elinor and his future wife Becky worked at Disney Studios while Carl was serving in the U.S. Marines at Quantico, Virginia as part of the Marine Corps film unit.

Becky and Carl were married at First Unitarian Church in Los Angeles, California on July 14, 1945 and had one child, Carla Larissa Fallberg, born in 1955. Becky continued to work for Disney Studios, eventually becoming the Manager of the Ink and Paint Department while Carl went on to work as a writer/cartoonist freelancing for Disney, Hanna Barbera, and several other cartoon studios and comic book publishers.

==Professional cartoonist==

=== &quot;Fiddletown &amp; Copperopolis&quot; ===
Fallbergs love of narrow gauge railroads in early mining communities was expressed through his cartoon drawings published in his Fiddletown &amp; Copperopolis gag strip which appeared in &quot;Railroad&quot; Magazine. A compilation of all his Fiddletown and Copperopolis cartoons into a book &quot;Fiddletown and Copperopolis - The life and times of an uncommon carrier&quot; was first published in 1960 by Hungerford Press. Subsequent editions werepublished by Heimburger House in 1985, 1998, and 2003.

From his early days at Disney, Carl shared his enthusiasm for Colorado&#x27;s narrow gauge railroads with Ward Kimball and the Grizzly Flats Railroad, and brought the theme to some comic stories he wrote, such as the Mickey Mouse story &quot;The Vanishing Railroad&quot;.

Carl Fallberg was a member of the Animation Guild I.A.T.S.E. Local 839.

===Disney===
Fallberg started working at Disney Studios in 1935. During the beginning of his career at Disney he worked as an assistant director and storyman on the Disney animated features Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Fantasia, and Bambi.

He moved to working on Disney comic books for Dell Publishing, and was noteworthy for scripting many of the Mickey Mouse serials illustrated by Paul Murry that appeared in &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; from the early 1950s to 1962, when the Team of Fallberg and Murry produced almost all of those serials in Walt Disney Comics and Stories. After that Murry would frequently work with other writers, but collaborations of the team would infrequently appear until 1973.

Besides working with Murry, Fallberg also freelanced to write and illustrate Disney comic books of Li&#x27;l Bad Wolf, Jiminy Cricket, Professor Ludwig Von Drake, Scrooge McDuck, Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Gyro Gearloose, Goofy, Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale, and many others. From 1963 to 1989, Carl also wrote scripts for the Disney Studio Program, and during 1974-1985 he wrote scripts for the comic strips &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Treasury of Classic Tales&quot; (Sunday) and the Disney Christmas Story daily strips that appeared each December. The last comic book story Carl wrote for Disney was &quot;Goofy the Kid&quot; in 1990.

Carl&#x27;s &quot;special&quot; Disney projects included writing the promotional comics &quot;Adventure in Disneyland&quot; (1955) for Richfield Oil and &quot;Mickey and Goofy Explore Energy&quot; (1976) for Exxon, which he later redesigned to promote the Epcot Universe of Energy attraction. He wrote the &quot;Sears Winnie the Pooh Coloring Book&quot; in 1975, contributed to &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot; (1969–70) Gulf Oil giveaway magazine and provided the text for two of Whitman&#x27;s &quot;Big Little Books&quot;: &quot;Donald Duck and the Luck of the Ducks&quot; and &quot;Donald Duck and the Fabulous Diamond Fountain&quot;.

===Hanna-Barbera===
From 1972 through 1981, Carl worked as a storyman and story director on the Hanna-Barbera cartoon television shows: Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space, Scooby-Doo, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kids, Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch, The All-New Popeye Hour, Laugh-a-Lympics, The Three Robonic Stooges and The Kwicky Koala Show. Carl also wrote for the Hanna-Barbera comic books of: The Flintstones, Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, and The Jetsons.

===Warner Bros.===
From 1953 through the early 1970s, Carl wrote for the Warner Bros. Animation characters of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Mary Jane &amp; Sniffles, and Speedy Gonzales, and was story director for Yosemite Sam, Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales. Also in this time period, Fallberg wandered back into animation working on the Warner Bros. Speedy and Daffy Show.

===Other cartoon comic books===
His work for MGM comic books included The Addams Family, Tom &amp; Jerry, Droopy, and Screwy Squirrel, and Mr. Magoo for UPA, and The Pink Panther and The Inspector for DePatie-Freleng. For Walter Lantz, Carl wrote Woody Woodpecker, Andy Panda, Chilly Willy, and Homer Pigeon comic books.

<text>Paul Murry (November 25, 1911 – August 4, 1989) was an American cartoonist and comics artist. He is best known for his Disney comics, which appeared in Dell Comics and Gold Key Comics from 1946 to 1984, particularly the Mickey Mouse and Goofy three-part adventure stories in &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot;.

==Biography==
Like many Disney comic book artists, Murry started his career working at the Walt Disney Studios. During his time there he was an assistant to legendary animator Fred Moore.

Starting in 1943, Murry worked on Disney newspaper strips, beginning with several installments of the Sunday-only &quot;José Carioca&quot; strip. This was followed by a number of episodes in the 1944–1945 &quot;Panchito&quot; strip, which replaced José Carioca&#x27;s, as well as some &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; strips in 1945. Murry then provided pencil art for the &quot;Uncle Remus and His Tales of Br&#x27;er Rabbit&quot; strip from the first installment on October 14, 1945 through July 14, 1946.

After leaving the studio in 1946, he began to work for Western Publishing doing stories featuring the Disney characters. Dell Four Color No. 129 (1946) featuring three Uncle Remus stories penciled by Murry was the first comic book containing his artwork.

Murry drew many Disney characters, including Donald Duck, Uncle Scrooge, Brer Rabbit, The Sleuth, and others. &quot;The Phantom Blot&quot; and &quot;Super Goof&quot; comic books contained many Murry stories. Besides Disney, Murry also drew Woody Woodpecker comics, the 1951–1953 &quot;Buck O&#x27;Rue&quot; comic strip (written by Dick Huemer), and gag cartoons.

He is best known for his rendition of Mickey Mouse, especially the Mickey/Goofy adventure stories, mostly in &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot;, and three-part serials in &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot;. Murry&#x27;s first published Mickey Mouse story was &quot;Mickey Mouse and the Monster Whale,&quot; in &quot;Vacation Parade&quot; #1 (July 1950). Murry next wrote a couple of Mickey Mouse stories for Dell&#x27;s One-Shots: &quot;The Mystery of the Double-Cross Ranch&quot; in issue #313 (February 1951) and &quot;The Ruby Eye of Homar-Guy-Am&quot; in #343 (August 1951).

Murry and writer Carl Fallberg began their run of Mickey Mouse and Goofy serials in &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; with &quot;The Last Resort&quot;, in issues #152–154 (May–July 1953). Murry and Fallberg continued to produce 3-part Mickey/Goofy adventures consistently from 1953 to 1962, and then occasionally from 1963 to 1972. When Fallberg moved on, Murry continued to draw single-part Mickey/Goofy adventures for &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; and &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; until 1984, retiring after more than 30 years of producing these stories. Murry died five years later, in 1989.

<doc id="666170" wikidata="Q1353874" url="?curid=666170" title="Kelsang Gyatso">
<text>Geshe Kelsang Gyatso (; 4 June 1931 – 17 September 2022) was a Buddhist monk, meditation teacher, scholar, and author. He was the founder and spiritual director of the New Kadampa Tradition-International Kadampa Buddhist Union (Function), a registered non-profit, modern Buddhist organization that came out of the Gelugpa school/lineage. They have 1,300 centres around the world, including temples, city temples and retreat centres that offer an accessible approach to ancient wisdom.

==Life and education in Tibet==
Geshe Kelsang Gyatso was born on July 19th, 1931, in Yangcho Tang, Western Tibet and named Lobsang Chuponpa. At eight years old, he joined Ngamring Jampa Ling Monastery where he was ordained as a novice monk and given the monastic name &quot;Kelsang Gyatso&quot; meaning &quot;Ocean of Good Fortune&quot;. He &quot;went on to study at Sera, one of the great monasteries of Tibet’s dominant Gelug school. He was trained in the traditional method of intense scholastic study and debate, and he studied for a geshe degree, an advanced distinction in Buddhist scholarship.&quot;

==Leaving Tibet and life in India==

After escaping to India via Nepal during the Tibetan exodus in 1959, Kelsang Gyatso stayed at the monastic study centre established at Buxa Fort in West Bengal, India. All he brought with him were two Buddhist scriptures — Shantideva&#x27;s &quot;Guide to the Bodhisattva&#x27;s Way of Life&quot; and a text by Je Tsongkhapa. In 1971, the Indian Government donated large tracts of land in South India to the community in exile, where separate monasteries were established. At this time, Kelsang Gyatso left the monastery at Buxa for Mussoorie (a hill station in the Indian state of Uttarakhand) where he taught and engaged in intensive meditation retreat for sixteen years. At that time Kelsang Gyatso was, as David Kay puts it, &quot;by all accounts, a very well respected scholar and meditator&quot; within the Tibetan exile community. He spent much of his time in India in retreat: &quot;over the next two decades he spent long periods in retreat in the Himalayan foothills.&quot;

==Journey to the West==
In 1976, at the suggestion of the Dalai Lama, Kelsang Gyatso was invited by Lama Thubten Yeshe through their mutual spiritual guide Trijang Rinpoche to become the resident teacher at the main FPMT center, Manjushri Institute in Ulverston, Cumbria in England. In 1991, following a three-year retreat in Tharpaland, Dumfries, he founded the NKT-IKBU . He retired as General Spiritual Director of the NKT-IKBU in August 2009 but continued to write books and practice materials.

Lama Yeshe&#x27;s decision to invite his former classmate to be Resident Teacher at the FPMT&#x27;s Manjushri Institute in England was advised by the Dalai Lama. He arrived in August 1977 and gave his first teaching on Lamrim on September 10.

Under Kelsang Gyatso&#x27;s spiritual direction, Manjushri Institute &quot;became a thriving training and retreat center.&quot; Kelsang Gyatso taught the General Program at Manjushri from 1977 to 1987. At that time, the Geshe studies programme was taught by Jampa Tekchok and then Konchog Tsewang (1982–1990). (In 1990 the Geshe Studies Programme at Manjushri Institute was cancelled, as it had been in most of the other FPMT Centres where it had been established.)

On October 13, 1983, Kelsang Gyatso became a naturalized British citizen.

==Establishing Buddhist centres==
In 1979, Kelsang Gyatso opened a Buddhist teaching centre (Madhyamaka Centre in Yorkshire) under the spiritual direction of his teacher H.E. Trijang Rinpoche. Geshe Kelsang Gyatso was given permission to update the presentation of the dharma (teachings of Buddhism) to be clear and accessible to western students.

In 1987, Kelsang Gyatso entered a 3-year retreat at Tharpaland International Retreat Centre in Dumfries, Scotland. During his retreat, he wrote five books and established the foundations of the NKT-IKBU. After completing his retreat in the early months of 1991, Kelsang Gyatso announced the creation of the NKT-IKBU, an event which was celebrated by his students in the NKT-IKBU magazine &quot;Full Moon&quot; as &quot;a wonderful development in the history of the Buddhadharma.&quot; Since that time, the NKT-IKBU has grown to comprise 1,300 centres worldwide, most principally study and meditation centers, some principally retreat centers, and six traditional-style Temples for World Peace.

Kelsang Gyatso&#x27;s teachings have a practical emphasis on teachings based on Lamrim, Lojong and Mahamudra.

Waterhouse commented that, &quot;He teaches in English with a strong Tibetan accent. He is an endearing character to look at; petite with slightly downcast eyes which look about him as he walks or teaches his devoted students.&quot; Spanswick observes that, &quot;many of those who hear him speak are struck by his wisdom and sincerity.&quot;

At the heart of the NKT-IKBU are its three study programs: the General Program, the Foundation Program, and the Teacher Training Program.

According to the NKT-IKBU, it &quot;seeks not to offer a westernized form of Buddhism, but rather to make traditional Gelugpa Buddhism accessible to westerners.&quot; To achieve this, Kelsang Gyatso taught himself English.

==Emphasis on lineage==
Kay says that NKT-IKBU practitioners practice their tradition exclusively, &quot;eschewing eclecticism.&quot; Kelsang Gyatso&#x27;s &quot;conservative and traditional presentation of Buddhism&quot; is appealing to Westerners who &quot;wish for a meaningful alternative to spiritual pluralism.&quot; According to Kelsang Gyatso in &quot;Understanding the Mind&quot;:

Therefore, Kelsang Gyatso taught in &quot;Great Treasury of Merit&quot; that the most effective way to progress spiritually is by &quot;following one tradition purely — relying upon one Teacher, practicing only his teachings, and following his Dharma Protector. If we mix traditions many obstacles arise and it takes a long time for us to attain realizations.&quot;

Geshe Kelsang was known as an exponent of Dorje Shugden practices, which brought him into conflict with the Tibetan political establishment.&quot; 

In 1996, he was accused of flagrant defamation of the Dalai Lama, which led to his expulsion from Sera Je Monastic University in India.

==Ordination of Westerners==
The new Kadampa tradition provides a modern supportive environment for those who sincerely wish to take their devotion to Buddhism deeper by becoming ordained.

==Development of Western Dharma teachers==
Kelsang Gyatso founded the New Kadampa Tradition &quot;to bring pure Buddhist teachings to the west,&quot; where he would train equally four types of teacher: monks, nuns, lay men and lay women. NKT-IKBU Dharma Centres are mixed communities of lay and ordained practitioners who are all on the same teaching programs. He also promoted the development of local teachers in their own language. This is a departure from most Tibetan Buddhist Centres where monastics take precedence over lay people, monks take precedence over nuns, and Tibetans take precedence over Westerners.

In a teaching called &quot;Training as a Qualified Dharma Teacher&quot;, Kelsang Gyatso explained where the teachers of the NKT-IKBU come from:

==Retirement==
In August 2009, he voluntarily stepped down as General Spiritual Director of the NKT-IKBU, in a democratic system of succession that he established in the NKT-IKBU&#x27;s &quot;Internal Rules&quot;.

Kelsang Gyatso engaged in meditation retreat and continued to write Dharma books to preserve and promote the Kadampa Buddhism of Je Tsongkhapa, in accordance with the instructions of Trijang Rinpoche. According to Richard Spanswick, &quot;Since taking up residence at Conishead Priory, Kelsang has been working to produce a complete set of instructions for westerners wishing to set out on the path to enlightenment.&quot; Continuing this task, a new book entitled &quot;Modern Buddhism: The Path of Wisdom and Compassion&quot; was released in January 2010, and its oral transmission was given by Kelsang Gyatso at the Fall 2010 NKT-IKBU Festival.

Kelsang Gyatso did not made any public appearances between October 2013 and his death in September 2022. The NKT stated he was &quot;in strict retreat&quot;.

==Death==
On 19 September 2022, the NKT announced the death of Venerable Geshe Kelsang Gyatso Rinpoche (which occurred two days before) via their website and social media. Their statement reads:

The community of Kechara Forest Retreat and visiting sangha from Shar Gaden, Serpom, Phelgyeling and Segyu monasteries offered a Lama Chopa puja and many candle offerings dedicated for Ven. Geshe-la&#x27;s swift return: &quot;Having established the New Kadampa Tradition, Ven. Geshe Kelsang Gyatso was the spiritual father to tens of thousands around the world. A true Kadampa master, Geshe-la dedicated his entire life to upholding the pure traditions of Je Tsongkhapa and Dorje Shugden, and his contribution to the lineage was unparalleled in recent times.&quot;

<text>In mathematics, specifically the study of differential equations, the Picard–Lindelöf theorem gives a set of conditions under which an initial value problem has a unique solution. It is also known as Picard&#x27;s existence theorem, the Cauchy–Lipschitz theorem, or the existence and uniqueness theorem.

The theorem is named after Émile Picard, Ernst Lindelöf, Rudolf Lipschitz and Augustin-Louis Cauchy.

== Theorem ==
Let formula_1 be a closed rectangle with formula_2, the interior of formula_3. Let formula_4 be a function that is continuous in formula_5 and Lipschitz continuous in formula_6 (with Lipschitz constant independent from formula_5). Then there exists some formula_8 such that the initial value problem
formula_9
has a unique solution formula_10 on the interval formula_11.

== Proof sketch ==
A standard proof relies on transforming the differential equation into an integral equation, then applying the Banach fixed-point theorem to prove the existence of a solution, and then applying Grönwall&#x27;s lemma to prove the uniqueness of the solution.

Integrating both sides of the differential equation formula_12 shows that any solution to the differential equation must also satisfy the integral equation

:formula_13

Given the hypotheses that formula_14 is continuous in formula_5 and Lipschitz continuous in formula_6, this integral operator is a contraction and so the Banach fixed-point theorem proves that a solution can be obtained by fixed-point iteration of successive approximations. In this context, this fixed-point iteration method is known as Picard iteration.

Set
:formula_17
and
:formula_18

It follows from the Banach fixed-point theorem that the sequence of &quot;Picard iterates&quot; formula_19 is convergent and that its limit is a solution to the original initial value problem. Next, applying Grönwall&#x27;s lemma to formula_20, where formula_21 and formula_22 are any two solutions, shows that formula_23 for any two solutions, thus proving that they must be the same solution and thus proving global uniqueness of the solution on the domain formula_3 where the theorem&#x27;s hypotheses hold.

== Example of Picard iteration ==

Let formula_25 the solution to the equation formula_26 with initial condition formula_27 Starting with formula_28 we iterate 

:formula_29 

so that formula_30:

:formula_31

:formula_32

:formula_33

and so on. Evidently, the functions are computing the Taylor series expansion of our known solution formula_34 Since formula_35 has poles at formula_36 it is not Lipschitz continuous in the neighborhood of those points, and the iteration converges toward a local solution for formula_37 only that is not valid over all of formula_38.

== Example of non-uniqueness ==
To understand uniqueness of solutions, contrast the following two examples of first order ordinary differential equations for . Both differential equations will possess a single stationary point 

First, the homogeneous linear equation (formula_39), a stationary solution is , which is obtained for the initial condition . Beginning with any other initial condition , the solution formula_40 tends toward the stationary point , but it only approaches it in the limit of infinite time, so the uniqueness of solutions over all finite times is guaranteed. 

By contrast for an equation in which the stationary point can be reached after a &quot;finite&quot; time, uniqueness of solutions does not hold. Consider the homogeneous nonlinear equation , which has at least these two solutions corresponding to the initial condition : and 

:formula_41

so the previous state of the system is not uniquely determined by its state at or after &quot;t&quot; = 0. The uniqueness theorem does not apply because the derivative of the function is not bounded in the neighborhood of and therefore it is not Lipschitz continuous, violating the hypothesis of the theorem.

== Detailed proof ==

Let formula_42 be the Lipschitz constant of formula_43 with respect to formula_44
The function formula_14 is continuous as a function of formula_46.
In particular, since formula_47 is a continuous function of formula_5, we have that for any point formula_49 and formula_50 there exist formula_51
such that formula_52 when formula_53. 
We have
formula_54
provided formula_55 and formula_56, which shows that formula_14 is continuous at formula_58.

Let formula_59 and take any formula_60 such that 
formula_61
is a subset of formula_62 where
formula_63
Such a set exists because formula_49 is in the interior of formula_62 by assumption. 
Let

:formula_66

which is the supremum of (the absolute values of) the slopes of the function.
The function formula_14 attains a maximum on formula_68 because formula_14 is continuous and formula_68 is compact. 
For a later step in the proof, we need that formula_71 so if formula_72 then change formula_73 to formula_74 and update formula_75 formula_76 formula_77 and formula_78 accordingly (this update will be needed at most once since formula_78 cannot increase as a result of restricting formula_68).

Consider formula_81, the function space of continuous functions formula_82
We will proceed by applying the Banach fixed-point theorem using the metric on formula_81 induced by the uniform norm. Namely, for each continuous function formula_84 the norm of formula_85 is
formula_86

The &quot;Picard operator&quot; formula_87 is defined for each formula_88 by formula_89 given by
formula_90

To apply the Banach fixed-point theorem, we must show that formula_91 maps a complete non-empty metric space &quot;X&quot; into itself and also is a contraction mapping.

We first show that formula_91 takes formula_93 into itself in the space of continuous functions with the uniform norm. 

Here, formula_93 is a closed ball in the space of continuous (and bounded) functions &quot;centered&quot; at the constant function formula_95. 
Hence we need to show that 
formula_96
implies
formula_97

where formula_98 is some number in formula_99 where the maximum is achieved. 
The last inequality in the chain is true since formula_100

Now let us prove that formula_91 is a contraction mapping as required to apply the Banach fixed-point theorem.
In particular, we want to show that there exists formula_102 such that
formula_103
for all formula_104

Let formula_105 and take any formula_104
Take formula_5 such that

:formula_108
Then, using the definition of formula_91,

:formula_110
where formula_111 because the domains of formula_112 are both formula_113
By definition, formula_114 and formula_115 so formula_116
Therefore, formula_91 is a contraction.
We have established that the Picard&#x27;s operator is a contraction on the Banach spaces with the metric induced by the uniform norm. This allows us to apply the Banach fixed-point theorem to conclude that the operator has a unique fixed point. In particular, there is a unique function
formula_118
such that 
formula_119 
Thus, formula_85 is the unique solution of the initial value problem, valid on the interval formula_121

==Optimization of the solution&#x27;s interval==
We wish to remove the dependence of the interval &quot;Ia&quot; on &quot;L&quot;. To this end, there is a corollary of the Banach fixed-point theorem: if an operator &quot;T&quot;&quot;n&quot; is a contraction for some &quot;n&quot; in N, then &quot;T&quot; has a unique fixed point. Before applying this theorem to the Picard operator, recall the following:

&quot;Proof.&quot; Induction on &quot;m&quot;. For the base of the induction () we have already seen this, so suppose the inequality holds for , then we have: 
formula_122

By taking a supremum over formula_123 we see that formula_124.

This inequality assures that for some large &quot;m&quot;, 
formula_125
and hence Γ&quot;m&quot; will be a contraction. So by the previous corollary Γ will have a unique fixed point. Finally, we have been able to optimize the interval of the solution by taking .

In the end, this result shows the interval of definition of the solution does not depend on the Lipschitz constant of the field, but only on the interval of definition of the field and its maximum absolute value.

== Other existence theorems ==
The Picard–Lindelöf theorem shows that the solution exists and that it is unique. The Peano existence theorem shows only existence, not uniqueness, but it assumes only that is continuous in , instead of Lipschitz continuous. For example, the right-hand side of the equation with initial condition is continuous but not Lipschitz continuous. Indeed, rather than being unique, this equation has at least three solutions:

:formula_126.

Even more general is Carathéodory&#x27;s existence theorem, which proves existence (in a more general sense) under weaker conditions on . Although these conditions are only sufficient, there also exist necessary and sufficient conditions for the solution of an initial value problem to be unique, such as Okamura&#x27;s theorem.

== Global existence of solution ==
The Picard–Lindelöf theorem ensures that solutions to initial value problems exist uniquely within a local interval formula_11, possibly dependent on each solution. The behavior of solutions beyond this local interval can vary depending on the properties of and the domain over which is defined. For instance, if is globally Lipschitz, then the local interval of existence of each solution can be extended to the entire real line and all the solutions are defined over the entire R. 

If is only locally Lipschitz, some solutions may not be defined for certain values of &quot;t&quot;, even if is smooth. For instance, the differential equation with initial condition has the solution &quot;y&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) = 1/(1-&quot;t&quot;), which is not defined at &quot;t&quot; = 1. Nevertheless, if is a differentiable function defined over a compact subset of Rn, then the initial value problem has a unique solution defined over the entire R. Similar result exists in differential geometry: if is a differentiable vector field defined over a domain which is a compact smooth manifold, then all its trajectories (integral curves) exist for all time.

<text>The Roman Catholic Bishop of Honolulu is the diocesan bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Honolulu in the United States, the Latin Church ecclesiastical territory over the entire state of Hawaii and the unincorporated Hawaiian Islands. The Honolulu diocese is a suffragan see in the ecclesiastical province administered by the metropolitan Archbishop of San Francisco. The Bishop of Honolulu is a member of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. He has two ecclesiastical seats: the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace and the Co-Cathedral of Saint Theresa of the Child Jesus, both located in the City of Honolulu.

Previous to the canonical elevation of the Diocese of Honolulu, a single priest led what was the Prefecture Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands. The prefecture apostolic was later incorporated into another ecclesiastical territory, led by a bishop serving as Vicariate Apostolic of Oriental Oceania. The prefecture was later elevated to a vicariate apostolic. The phrase &quot;Sandwich Islands&quot; was later deleted and replaced by &quot;Hawaiian Islands&quot;. Five bishops have led the Vicariate Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands. All bishops were members of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary.

Five diocesan bishops have served the Diocese of Honolulu. On May 17, 2005 Pope Benedict XVI appointed the fifth bishop of Honolulu Msgr. Clarence Silva, who was consecrated and installed on July 21, 2005.

==Church organization==

Under civil laws, the Bishop of Honolulu acts as president of the Roman Catholic Church in Hawaii as corporation sole. He oversees several agencies and departments that include but are not limited to: Augustine Educational Foundation, Catholic Campus Ministry, Catholic Charities, Department of Religious Education, Ethnic Ministry, Office of Worship, Eastern Catholic Vicariate, Saint Stephen Diocesan Center, Social Ministry, Diocesan Tribunal. He is also the publisher of the Hawai‘i Catholic Herald newspaper.

Efficient administration necessitated the creation of several vicariates served by vicars forane directly subordinate to the Bishop of Honolulu. The vicariates forane are: West Honolulu Vicariate, East Honolulu Vicariate, Windward O‘ahu Vicariate, Leeward O‘ahu Vicariate, Maui Vicariate, West Hawai‘i Vicariate, East Hawai‘i Vicariate and Kaua‘i Vicariate. A separate vicariate was created for ethnic communities and persons belonging to any of the Eastern Catholic Churches. Within each vicariate are the individual parish churches, each led by pastors.

==Interment==
All those who served as Vicar Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands or Bishop of Honolulu are buried in the Honolulu Catholic Cemetery, with the exception of Bishop Louis Maigret, Bishop James Sweeney, Bishop John Joseph Scanlan and Bishop Joseph Anthony Ferrario. Bishops Maigret and Scanlan were buried in the crypt of the Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace. Bishop Sweeney was buried in his family crypt in Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, California. The location of the remains of the Vicar Apostolic of Oriental Oceania, Bishop Etienne Jerome Rouchouze are unknown. He is believed to have died at sea in a shipwreck. The remains of the only Prefect Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands, Msgr. Alexis Bachelot, SS.CC. are believed to be buried on Naha in the Marshall Islands.

==Prelates==
Prelates are listed below with their terms of service and titles held while in Hawaii. Msgr. Alexis Bachelot lead the Prefecture Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands.

<text>In computing, a spatial file manager is a file manager that uses a spatial metaphor to represent files and folders as if they were real physical objects.

==Concepts==
The base requirements of a spatial file manager are:

# Each folder is represented by a single window.
# Each window is unambiguously and irrevocably tied to a particular folder.
# Stability: files, folders, and windows go where the user moves them, stay where the user puts them (&quot;preserve their spatial state&quot;), and retain all their other &quot;physical&quot; characteristics (like size, shape, color and location).
# The same item can only be viewed in one window at a time.

Given an arbitrary window in a spatial file manager, it must be possible to determine with complete certainty which folder that window represents. Furthermore, it must not be possible to change that association.

Traditionally, when a folder is opened, the icon representing the folder changes —perhaps from an image showing a closed drawer to an opened one, perhaps the folder&#x27;s icon turns into a silhouette filled with a pattern— and a new window is opened. Attempting to open that &quot;already opened&quot; folder will simply reveal the existing window. A new window will not be created because that would violate requirement number one listed above, attempting to reveal an already opened folder&#x27;s contents using another window will either close the existing folder before opening it or refuse to reveal said contents. The change in the folder icon&#x27;s state is meant to be a visual reminder of this behavior. It says, &quot;This folder is already open.&quot; Similarly, while a document or application is open, its icons also represents this status and re-opening it will just reveal and bring it back to the front.

A common alternative to the spatial file manager is the navigational file manager or &quot;browser-style&quot; file manager. A window in such a system is a device through which the contents of many folders may be viewed. A browser-style window is not tied to any particular folder. The window&#x27;s spatial state (size, position, etc.) stays the same as the contents of many different folders are viewed through it. More than one browser window may show the contents of a particular folder simultaneously.

==Examples==
Examples of file managers that use a spatial metaphor by default include:
* Amiga&#x27;s Workbench
* Apple&#x27;s Finder 5 to 9 (versions prior to Mac OS X)
* BeOS&#x27;s Tracker
* Enlightenment 17&#x27;s file manager
* GNOME&#x27;s Nautilus from version 2.6 till 2.29
* the OS/2 Workplace Shell
* the RISC OS Filer
* the ROX Desktop&#x27;s ROX-Filer
* Windows Explorer in Windows 95 was also a spatial file manager in some aspects, but became a navigational file manager in later versions of the operating system (when using the default settings)

MATE&#x27;s Caja file manager has a spatial mode, but is navigational by default.

==Other objects==
Some file managers represent other objects, such as a trash can for unwanted files, or computer or floppy disk icons to represent storage media. There may also be special folders that contain special items such as user preferences or the user&#x27;s applications.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
===Advantages===
A spatial file manager is closer to the way the people interact with the physical objects around them, such as desks, chairs and tables. Since spatial properties are reliable indicators of &quot;location&quot; in a spatial file manager, the user may build up a familiar work environment by arranging commonly used windows, secure in the knowledge that this state will be preserved and will always map to the expected locations. This familiarity can lead to increased comfort and efficiency.

Furthermore, identification based on spatial attributes is a very natural human ability, requiring little or no conscious thought. The ability to recognize and recall locations within the hierarchy based on the appearance and position of folder windows is the primary purpose of the spatial file manager. All of the &quot;rules&quot; and behaviors that define the spatial file manager are designed to ensure that the strengths of the visual/spatial recognition and recall abilities of the human brain are leveraged. The idea is that these abilities are more natural and require &quot;less work&quot; than other forms of recognition based on reading text, maintaining an awareness of &quot;current working directory&quot; (in a command-line environment, for example), relying on the memory of past actions, or any other non-spatial cues.

One more advantage is that it allows the user to keep things arranged a certain way from one session to the next, as with the &quot;workspace&quot; settings in many high-end software packages. For instance, the windows showing the contents of different folders for a complex project could be tiled onscreen in such a fashion that all of them could be seen at the same time. In a browser-style file manager, one would be forced to rearrange these same windows every time they were reopened.

===Disadvantages===
The spatial metaphor can seem awkward to those accustomed to browser-style file managers. One complaint is that spatial managers use too many windows, leading to clutter. In a Windows 95 usability study by Microsoft, users of varying experience were said to be &quot;confused&quot; by the many windows:
Proponents claim that this confusion is partially a result of the non-spatial nature of the Windows 95 file manager. When the connection between the spatial state of a window is not unambiguously and irrevocably connected with a particular folder, it becomes impossible reliably to recognize a particular folder based on its spatial qualities. Spatial state often becomes misleading in a non-spatial file manager. Users may incorrectly identify a window based on visual cues that do not actually link it to any particular folder, but are instead properties of the browser-style window itself. In such an environment, each new window adds clutter without recognizable meaning. This leads to the often-cited preference for a single window through which any folder may be viewed: a browser. The proliferation and familiarity of web browsers has strengthened this preference.

Also, maintaining spatial familiarity can be difficult when the file system is accessed from a variety of applications and devices with differing display capabilities. Reproducing a single spatial arrangement on many different display devices is sometimes impractical. Per-device, per-user, or per-display spatial state is one possible solution, at the cost of an increased amount of state information that must be stored.
