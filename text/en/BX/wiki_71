<text>Ambilineality is a form of kinship affiliation of cognatic descent that relies on self-defined affiliation within a given social system, meaning individuals have the choice to be affiliated with their mother&#x27;s or father&#x27;s group. Common features of societies that practice ambilineality are a shared set of land, communal responsibilities, and collective ownership of some segments of wealth and debt in their societies. This system of descent is distinct from more common genealogical structures in that rather than determining affiliation and descent using the standard determinants of biological and genealogical relation, it instead relies heavily on voluntary affiliation with one&#x27;s group, oftentimes being determined by factors including residence.

Societies practicing ambilineal descent are especially common in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Polynesian cultures and Micronesian cultures are often ambilineal, including, for example, Samoans, Māori, Hawaiians and people of the Gilbert Islands. The indigenous peoples of Northwestern North America are also followers of ambilineality; and it is also found among the Southern Yoruba people residing in West Africa.

== Family ==
Ambilineality is a cognatic descent system in which individuals may be affiliated either to their father&#x27;s or mother&#x27;s group. This type of descent results in descent groups which are non-unilineal in the sense that descent passes either through women or men, contrary to unilineal descent, whether patrilineal or matrilineal. Affiliation to a descent group will be determined either by choice or by residence. In the latter case, children will belong to the descent group with whom their parents are living.

== Property relations ==
Generally, an ambilineal descent group consists of known descendants who can trace their line of descent, through either the male or female line, to the individual who was given usage rights over the land.

The grantee&#x27;s descendants have absolute usage rights to a portion of land. If they are residents, they are to be appointed to leadership and administration positions relating to the governance of the land. Those living descendants of the chosen ancestor who follow these claims to land comprise an ambilineal descent group with corporate interests in the land granted to the ancestor.

Similarly, inheritance is acquired through mother and father and property is transmitted through both sons and daughters, as all genders have the right to inheritance.

== Kinship system ==
As a kinship system, ambilineality uses genealogy to trace descent either through the mother or the father. There is no set order in an ambilineal system to which the last name is chosen, and individuals may use both parents as links to a kin. In several cultures, such as the Tiwa, the choice of whether to associate with the male or female family is a personal decision.

The choice of which familial line to trace descent may be influenced by culture. Societies may have a law or cultural customs determining whether to trace descent through the mother or father for a child&#x27;s surname. This choice and tradition influences practices of the culture regarding which kin to associate with. Emphasis on descent through the female line came about because of people&#x27;s interest in whitening their lineage since Brazilian women frequently married white European immigrants. Brazil did have an ambilineal system, but there was an underlying matrilineal emphasis. This was particularly common in the first hundred years of European colonization, particularly in Brazil. It was due to the Iberian concept of “purity of blood” (Spanish: limpieza de sangre) and their dislike of “infected” races such as Jews or Moors.

== Social functions ==
In an ambilineal descent system the members can choose and change their affiliation or clan. This means that membership in an ambilineal group is associated with more freedom and is less binding and restricting than in unilineal descent groups. The flexibility of the descent group enables people to exercise a greater choice in their behavior towards kinsmen, especially distant kins. Furthermore, a person can choose whether or not they will honor their group responsibilities.

The ambilineal system also gives way to a more variable group membership and a more flexible group structure. Oftentimes people use the ability of choice to realign themselves with the more powerful or higher status option. For example, in the Togan people of the Northern Gilbert Islands it is common for a couple, with differing social status, to join the descent group with the higher status.

== Naming system/surnames ==
The naming system in an ambilineal descent system allows for either using the mother or father&#x27;s last name for the children or both, which is common in Latin America. Many societies have laws or strong cultural norms which dictate a child&#x27;s surname. For example, in the U.S., it is the cultural custom for a child to have the father&#x27;s surname, but in cases where the parents are not married, it is common for the child to take the surname of the mother. In the U.S., due to divorces and subsequent marriages, the surnames of children can also change.

There is an ambilineal naming system in Spain and many Latin American countries, but with an implicit patrilineality. Children have both their mother and their father&#x27;s surnames, but grandchildren use their father&#x27;s and mother&#x27;s paternal surnames. In Brazil, the choice of surnames also has ambilineal tendencies. It depends on the personal desires of the parents or the person themselves, and modifying them was common in the first hundred years of colonization. However, it was the cultural tendency to use both the mother and the father&#x27;s surnames following the general Spanish practice.

In the Tiwa, it is a “personal choice” whether to live in the mother or father&#x27;s home, indicating which “clan” they will join. Based on this choice, the children inherit the mother or father&#x27;s surname when born into the respective clans. These choices reflect the understanding of belonging and identity.

== Kinship terms ==
There have been disagreements on the topic of kinship terminology in ambilineal descent systems. While ambilineal kinship terminology is oftentimes described as either generational or using cross-generational relative age criterion, there is some push back on these ideas.

Anthropologists have found that in ambilineal systems (such as those in Samoa) membership is often based on kinship criteria, but that one&#x27;s role or label within the ambilineal group can be based on non-kinship criteria. This means that to determine if an individual is kin or not, genealogical criteria are often used, but once the individual is determined to be kin other (non-kinship) criteria will be used to designate a specific kin term. These kin distinctions within a group do not have any significance on the individual station as kinsmen. Because ambilineal sometimes do not have role allocation based on the “differentiation of kin-types” and kinship terminologies are based on such non-kin criteria some scholars have argued that in these groups kinships terms should not be used as terms of address.

== Ambilineality in specific ethnic groups and regions ==

===In the Americas===

====Brazil====
In Brazil, ambilineality is seen in choosing the surname of children, where it is common that a child takes both parents&#x27; surnames. During the first hundred years of colonization, it was common for families to trace lineage through matrilineal descent because of their interest in whitening their lineage. The Portuguese were concerned about the purity of blood, (see: limpieza de sangre) because of Jewish persecution and brought these ideas to Brazil. The European immigrants were primarily males until the 1800s; therefore, &quot;mixed-blood&quot; daughters could whiten their lineage by marrying and having children with white European immigrants. Over time, the generations became whiter and could, therefore, amass more power in Brazilian society. The Portuguese husbands provided more whiteness for the offspring, but the children would typically adopt the maternal surname if the wife&#x27;s family were wealthier and more established. This is particularly true when the wife came from one of the more prominent families. Taking the mother&#x27;s name identified the child as part of the family and gave access to the same power of the family.

===In Africa===

===Ethiopia===
The Christian Amhara trace their descent ambilineally. They are considered as kin relatives from both the mother and father&#x27;s side. Any Amhara is thus the descendant of a set of lineages which multiply rapidly back through the generations. The Amhara confer rights of inheritance on both sexes, recognize inheritance though both father and mother, and transmit goods through both sons and daughters. Whereas men and women have equal rights in theory, in practice, this does not always hold.

Ambilineal descent also occurs amongst the Tegrefifin speakers who border the Amhara to the north although they have a clear bias in favor of the men. Nevertheless, their rules of inheritance and descent mean that Christian Ethiopians lack the patrilineal, narrow descent groups of western Christianity, and have a set of rules for transmitting property which tends towards radical fragmentation.

Amongst the Christian Abyssinians, marriage happens outside the first seven degrees of consanguinity and work hard to live up to this rule. The laity seldom marry in church, instead marrying by secular contract under customary law. Polygyny was common amongst the Abbysnian nobility, characterized by rough equality. They lacked a strong sense of legitimacy or bastardy for children. Moreover, amongst Ethiopians, women had the right to initiate divorce and to take a share of the property from their marriage upon divorce.

Abyssinian families are distinguished from other traditional Christian families by their prevalence of divorce and a pronounced ambilineality. However, they also have a strong culture of monogamy amongst Christian priests and their lay counterparts.

===In Asia===

====India====
In the Tiwa (Lalung) people who live at the Assam-Meghalaya border area in India, ambilineal descent is evident through their marriage and residence practices. At marriage each couple has the choice to join the wife or husband&#x27;s clan. There are no set rules as to which house a couple occupies after marriage but, among the Tiwa people, gobhia (husband joining the wife&#x27;s house) is more common than poari (wife joining husband&#x27;s house). Any children born to the couple belong to the group chosen at the time of marriage. This means that an individual inherits the mother&#x27;s name if born into her house or the father&#x27;s name if born into his house.

There is a spiritual dimension to ambilineal descent in Tiwa culture. Membership and affiliation to a descent group is expressed via surname (and domestic belonging/residence associated) as well as connection to deities. The Tiwas believe that there are numerous deities that inhabit the home. At birth a child inherits the house&#x27;s descent group and the bonds that have been established between the god inhabiting the home. This affiliation with the deities serves as a principal criteria for lineage identification because the individual is associated with all of the houses within the descent group that are worshipping the same group deity. For example, two individuals who have the same surname could claim unrelatedness if they do not worship the same group deity.

===In Polynesia===
In Polynesia, numerous groups are found to have ambilineal descent systems. In the Northern Gilbert Islands ambilineal descent systems are evident in both Butaritari and Makin. In both groups ambilineal descent is understood through land ownership, occupation, and inheritance. Membership in an ambilineal descent group, often called a ramage, includes those who can trace their descent (through either the female or male line) to the founder of the group, as well as individuals who can trace their descent to the founder and have inherited land rights to a part of the founder&#x27;s estate. In this system an individual is not a member of every group they can genealogically trace kinship to. Rather, membership depends on land possession within the group. Upon marriage, couples have the choice in which group they want to join.

Ambilineal systems are also found in Samoa, Tonga and with Māori people in New Zealand. Similarly to Butaritari and Makin, land ownership and inheritance is the basis for membership and affiliation in a descent group, but in these three systems membership is most often based on the male line. In this system, both the mother and father can be used for affiliation with a particular descent group, but emphasis is placed on the father. While it is most desirable for membership into the father&#x27;s group female links are also used especially when aligning with the female line brings increased power, wealth, or social standing.

<doc id="680073" wikidata="Q2987397" url="?curid=680073" title="Roy Campbell (poet)">
<text>Ignatius Royston Dunnachie Campbell, better known as Roy Campbell (2 October 1901 – 23 April 1957), was a South African poet, literary critic, literary translator, war poet and satirist. Most of his adult life was spent in Europe.

Born into a white South African family of Scottish descent in Durban, Colony of Natal, Campbell was sent to England to attend Oxford University. Instead, he failed the entrance exam and drifted into London&#x27;s literary bohemia. Following his marriage to the bohemian Englishwoman Mary Garman, he wrote the well-received poem &quot;The Flaming Terrapin&quot; which brought the Campbells into the highest circles of British literature.

After experiencing both shunning and social ostracism for supporting racial equality as the editor of the South African literary magazine &quot;Voorslag&quot;, Campbell returned to England and became involved with the Bloomsbury Group. He ultimately decided that the Bloomsbury Group was snobbish, promiscuous, nihilistic and anti-Christian. He lampooned them in a mock-epic poem called &quot;The Georgiad&quot;, which damaged his reputation in literary circles. His subsequent conversion to Roman Catholicism in Spain and vocal support for Francisco Franco and the Nationalist faction during the Spanish Civil War caused him to be labelled a fascist by influential left-wing literati, further damaging his reputation as a poet. He served in the British Army during Second World War and briefly attended meetings of The Inklings during this period, where he befriended C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien. 

In the post-war period, Campbell continued to write and translate poetry and to lecture. He also joined other White South African writers and intellectuals, including Laurens van der Post, Alan Paton, and Uys Krige, in speaking out against apartheid. Campbell died in a car accident in Portugal on Easter Monday, 1957.

Though Campbell was considered by T. S. Eliot, Dylan Thomas and Edith Sitwell to have been one of the best poets of the period between the First and Second World Wars, the accusation that he was a fascist, which was first promulgated during the 1930s, continues to seriously damage his reception, though some literary critics have attempted to rehabilitate his reputation.

==Early life==
===Family origins===
According to Campbell, his family history had been traced out, despite their differing views about the Spanish Civil War, by &quot;that valiant and fine writer, my friend, the late George Orwell.&quot; 

Campbell&#x27;s paternal ancestors were Scottish Covenanters and members of Clan Campbell, who left the Gàidhealtachd of Scotland after their Chief, the Earl of Argyll, was defeated in battle by the Royalist Marquess of Montrose in 1645. The Campbell family then settled as part of the Plantation of Ulster at Carndonagh, in Inishowen, County Donegal. During the centuries when they lived in Donegal, the ancestors of the poet were &quot;bog-trotting Scotch-Irish peasants who were tenants of the Kilpatricks, the squires of Carndonagh.&quot; Many of the Campbell men were said to have been talented fiddlers. The living standards of the Campbell family improved drastically around 1750, when one of the poet&#x27;s ancestors eloped with &quot;one of the Kilpatrick girls&quot;, whom he had met &quot;while he was fiddling at a ball given by the Squire.&quot;

Campbell&#x27;s grandfather, William Campbell, emigrated to the Colony of Natal with his family aboard from Glasgow in 1850. William Campbell adapted well to life in Africa and built the breakwater that still forms the foundation of the great North Pier in Durban harbour. He also built a large and very successful sugar cane plantation. Campbell&#x27;s father, Samuel George Campbell, was born in Durban in 1861. In 1878 he travelled to Edinburgh to study medicine. He graduated with honours in 1882 and completed postgraduate work at the Pasteur Institute in Paris; he also studied ear, nose and throat ailments in Vienna. In 1886, Campbell&#x27;s father returned to Scotland to take his M.D. and to become a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons.

While in Scotland, Dr Campbell married Margaret Wylie Dunnachie, daughter of James Dunnachie, of Glenboig, Lanarkshire, a wealthy self-made businessman, and Jean Hendry of Eaglesham. In his memoirs, Campbell alleges: &quot;My maternal grandmother was a Gascon from Bayonne and though I never met her, I inherit through her my love of bulls, and of Provençal, French, and Spanish poetry.&quot; According to Campbell, his Dunnachie ancestors were &quot;Highland Jacobites who fled Scotland&quot; after the Jacobite rising of 1745, but returned after the 1747 Act of Indemnity. Also according to Campbell, his maternal grandfather, James Dunnachie, was an acquaintance of poets Robert Browning and Alfred Tennyson and corresponded with Mark Twain.

In 1889, Campbell&#x27;s parents moved to Natal, where his father established a successful medical practice. Dr Campbell often travelled long distances on foot to treat patients and, in an unprejudiced approach rare in colonial South Africa, would treat both black and white patients. He also was generous to patients who could not afford to pay. &quot;Sam Joj&quot;, as he was called, was remembered kindly by the Zulu people of Natal.

===Childhood===
Roy Campbell was the third son of Samuel and Margaret Campbell, was born in Durban, Colony of Natal, on 2 October 1901. At that time, Roy&#x27;s father was on active service as a major with the Natal Volunteer Medical Corps in the Second Boer War and did not learn of the child&#x27;s birth for several days. Campbell was named Ignatius Royston Dunnachie Campbell for an uncle and christened in a Presbyterian ceremony.

According to Campbell, his first memory was of his Zulu nurse maid, Catherine Mgadi, who wheeled him further than usual on their morning outing to a site overlooking the Indian Ocean. Mgadi told him that the Indian Ocean was &quot;Lwandhla&quot;, the word for the sea in the Zulu language, which Cambell later described as his first word.

After the birth of his younger brother, Neil Campbell, Roy was increasingly left in the care of Mgadi and he would later cite her as an early influence. Campbell also played regularly with boys from among the Zulu people. According to biographer Joseph Pearce, Cambell was influenced by these different cultures and by colonialism.

Campbell later described the Zulu people as &quot;highly intellectual&quot; and highly-skilled conversationalists, claiming that conversation &quot;is the only art they have&quot;. His daughter, Teresa Campbell, said he respected the Zulu people &quot;tremendously&quot; and attributed Roy&#x27;s skill at social mixing to this childhood influence.

Cambell was also influenced by Scottish culture via his father&#x27;s Scottish coachman Dooglie, who taught the Campbell sons the Great Highland bagpipes and Highland dancing.

===Teenager and voyage to England===
Educated at Durban High School, Campbell counted literature and the outdoor life among his first loves. He was an accomplished horseman, hunter, and fisherman. In 1916, as the First World War was raging in Europe, a 15-year-old Campbell ran away from home and enlisted in the South African Overseas Expeditionary Force. He used the assumed name of Roy McKenzie and claimed to be an 18-year-old from Southern Rhodesia. However, a suspicious officer telephoned the Campbell family&#x27;s home. Roy&#x27;s sister Ethel picked up the phone and confirmed that Roy was only 15. Ethel later wrote &quot;This was the first that any of us knew of his having run away from school and joined up.

At the end of 1917 Campbell left school with a third degree matriculation pass, which was the lowest possible pass mark. He registered at Natal University College, intending to read English, physics, and botany. His heart was not in his studies, however. The war was still raging and Campbell intended to enlist as soon as he was old enough, and hoped to attend the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.

Campbell left the Union of South Africa in December 1918 aboard the &quot;Inkonka&quot;, a 2,000-ton tramp steamer. Almost as soon as the ship lost sight of land, the third mate entered Roy&#x27;s cabin and, objecting to the large number of books, threw all of them, as well as Roy&#x27;s painting and drawing materials, out of the porthole and into the sea. &quot;Campbell,&quot; according to Pearce, &quot;looked on as his cherished volumes of Shakespeare, Milton, Keats, Dryden, Pope, and Marlowe,&quot; disappeared over the side. In the absence of his books, Campbell spent much of the voyage on the fo&#x27;c&#x27;sle, watching &quot;all those strange and beautiful creatures that inhabit the majestic southern extremity of our continent.&quot; Pearce also maintains that &quot;Campbell&#x27;s love affair with the sea, thus far expressed only in poetically imagined theory, was consummated by the cascading waters off the Cape.&quot;

When the &quot;Inkonka&quot; docked at Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, Campbell went ashore with one of the ship&#x27;s apprentices, who was a Roman Catholic. While inside Las Palmas Cathedral, Campbell was shown several holy relics, including the heart of Bishop Juan de Frías, &quot;who sacrificed himself to the protection of the Guanches or natives of the Canaries.&quot; According to Pearce, &quot;Campbell recalled that the heart was so magnified by the glass and the spirits in which it was kept that he laughed in a superior way and swore it was the heart of a rhino or hippo. His skepticism suggests an antagonism towards Catholicism, but was also indicative of a general disillusionment with Christianity. He had moved from a lukewarm and half-hearted acceptance of his parents&#x27; Presbyterianism towards an inarticulate agnosticism.&quot;

In February 1919, Cambell&#x27;s ship steamed into the estuary of the Thames River during a particularly cold winter. Campbell later wrote, &quot;It was certainly by far the widest river I had ever seen... Then warehouses and other phantasmal buildings loomed out of the most on the distantly converging banks. Slowly, forests of masts and banks began to appear, and moving almost imperceptibly we berthed in the East India Docks cracking the first film of ice I had ever seen.&quot; After a brief tour of London on a donkey cart, Campbell took a train to Scotland to meet his maternal grandfather James Dunnachie, who gave his grandson £10, with which Campbell replaced the books he had lost at the beginning of the voyage.

According to his daughter Anna Campbell Lyle, Roy had grown up where &quot;everything was beautiful, and like paradise,&quot; and then he came to &quot;this funny little country full of fog, with no wild animals, very little sun and no mountains – he had a really mystical feeling about mountains... So he got a funny thing about England. I think he was terribly anti-Anglo-Saxon. He had a passion for Celts.&quot; Campbell later wrote in his memoir &quot;Broken Record&quot;, &quot;My ancestors cleared out of Britain at the first whiff of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and I only came back to see what made them clear off in such a hurry, which I soon found out.&quot;

==From Oxford to Bohemia==
===Oxford===
After a brief stay with his grandfather, Campbell travelled to Oxford University, where he hoped to pass the entrance exams to Merton College. During the spring of 1919, Oxford was filled with returning veterans of the Great War. Painfully shy, Campbell hid himself away in an attic room and read voraciously. He later wrote, &quot;Never before, or since, have I done so much reading as I did at Oxford. Had I taken an ordinary course in English for three years, I would not have read a quarter as much.&quot;

While the Irish War of Independence was then taking place Campbell expressed support for Irish Republicanism in letters to his parents, despite his descent from Orangemen.

During this time, Campbell discovered the poetry of T. S. Eliot, which was then all the rage. He also attempted to write imitations of the poetry of both Eliot and Paul Verlaine. Campbell took as his subject &quot;the gloomy railway stations he had seen on his recent journeys to and from Scotland.&quot; Campbell, however, was dissatisfied with the results and burned his manuscripts. He later said, &quot;My early poems were so fragile and attenuated that Verlaine is robust in comparison.&quot;

While attending Greek tutorials, Campbell struck up a friendship with the future classical composer William Walton, who shared his enthusiasm for the poetry of Eliot and the Sitwells, and for the prose writings of Wyndham Lewis. Campbell later described Walton as &quot;a real genius, and, at the same time, one of the finest fellows I ever met in my life.&quot; Even though Campbell preferred ragtime and the Border ballads to classical music, the two friends shared an intense hatred for learning Greek. Instead, they routinely neglected their studies &quot;so they could enjoy endless nights on the town consuming large quantities of beer.&quot;

According to Pearce, &quot;... claims in a biography of Campbell by Peter Alexander that Campbell had &#x27;at least two short-lived homosexual affairs&#x27; at this time may well be unfounded. Although it is possible that Campbell went through a bisexual phase at Oxford, Alexander makes no effort to justify the claim and chooses not to name the two men alleged to have been the objects of Campbell&#x27;s devotion. He merely cites Campbell&#x27;s friend Robert Lyle as the source of the allegations. Lyle, however, states categorically, &#x27;I know &quot;nothing&quot; of any homosexual attachments.&#x27; This being so, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary one should perhaps assume that Campbell&#x27;s friendships at Oxford were platonic.&quot;

Despite his reading, Campbell failed the Oxford entrance examination. Reporting this to his father, Campbell took a philosophical stance, telling him that &quot;university lectures interfere very much with my work&quot;, which was writing poetry. His verse writing was stimulated by avid readings of Nietzsche, Darwin, and the English Elizabethan and Romantic poets. Among his early fruitful contacts were C. S. Lewis, William Walton, the Sitwells, and Wyndham Lewis. 

He also began to drink heavily, and continued to do so for the rest of his life.

===London===
Campbell left Oxford for London in 1920, where he immediately sank into what he later dubbed &quot;that strange underworld ... known as Bohemia.&quot;

Nina Hamnett later recalled, &quot;Roy Campbell was about seventeen and very beautiful indeed. He had the most wonderful grey eyes with long black eyelashes. He spoke with an odd gruff voice and a funny accent.&quot; Campbell gifted Hamnett a book of poems by Arthur Rimbaud and kept her amused by singing what she later termed &quot;Kaffir Songs&quot; in the Zulu language. In response, Hamnet&#x27;s friend Marie Beerbohm gave Campbell the nickname &quot;Zulu&quot;, which stuck fast.

==Cohabitation and marriage==
===Meeting and cohabitation===
Mary Garman was then living in a flat near Regent Square with her sister Kathleen. The sisters regularly paid court to young artists and musicians and often hosted bohemian parties. Although Mary was already intimately involved with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren, Campbell caught her attention immediately when she first saw him. Mary later wrote, &quot;My sister Kathleen ... and I were riding on the top of a bus in Tottenham Court Road ... When we saw Roy for the first time. He got off the bus when we did and made for the Eiffel Tower Restaurant in Charlotte Street. We were quite intrigued, he was so good-looking, so foreign, who could he be? Once inside the restaurant he went straight to a table where a golden-haired girl, Iris Tree, was sitting alone, evidently waiting for him.&quot;

When they formally met a few weeks later Roy found himself confronted with &quot;the most beautiful woman I had ever seen.&quot;

The homeless Campbell was invited by Mary and Kathleen to move in with them. Their daughter, Teresa Campbell, would later write, &quot;In their different ways they were trying to escape convention. As my mother was always saying when she was about eighty – &#x27;Roy and I were the first Hippies&#x27; and she seemed very proud of the fact.&quot; In the evenings, the three would lie arm in arm next to the fire, and Campbell would read his poetry aloud and would entertain both women with stories of his adventures in Provence and in the South African bush. For a time, van Dieren continued to visit the Garman sisters&#x27; flat, but eventually he admitted defeat. Kathleen was the mistress and muse of the married American sculptor Jacob Epstein, who was &quot;violently jealous&quot; and certain that Campbell was sleeping with both sisters.

In the winter of 1921, just two months after they had met, Campbell accompanied Mary and Kathleen to their family&#x27;s estate at Oakeswell Hall, near Wednesbury, Staffordshire, to spend Christmas with the Garman family. Upon their arrival, Kathleen Garman said to her father: &quot;Father, this is Roy, who&#x27;s going to marry Mary.&quot; Horrified, Dr. Garman cried, &quot;My eldest daughter?! To a complete stranger?!&quot; Campbell later admitted that he felt deeply uncomfortable during the visit and knew that the eyes of the Garman family were always watching him. At first, desperate for them to accept him, Campbell refused to drink wine during meals. In time, however, he was regularly escaping the anxiety of the visit by going on drunken binges at the local pub. In response, Dr. Garman tried to persuade his daughter to call off the wedding, saying that she was &quot;marrying a dipsomaniac&quot;. Campbell&#x27;s daughter Anna later wrote, &quot;All their good sense was useless. My parents already considered themselves eternal partners.&quot;

===Marriage===
On 11 February 1922, Campbell and Mary Garman were married in the Church of England parish at Wednesbury, near her family&#x27;s estate. As Campbell owned no formal suit, he had purchased one second-hand for 12 shillings. Mary, however, was horrified and demanded that Campbell change back into his usual clothing. Mary wore a long black dress with a golden veil, not to be eccentric but simply because she had nothing else. During the ceremony, when Campbell knelt before the altar, he exposed the holes in the soles of his shoes to the whole congregation. In response, Mary&#x27;s former nanny was heard to lament, &quot;Oh dear, I always thought Miss Mary would marry a gentleman with a park!&quot;

Campbell later wrote, &quot;My father heard of our marriage too late to stop it; he was naturally hurt that, being a minor, I had not consulted him about it, since he had always been so good to me and always sent me any money I asked for when I was hard up. My excuse was, and still is, that I was taking absolutely no risks at all of not getting married to this girl.&quot; Due to his decision to marry without paternal consent, Campbell forfeited, for a time, his generous parental allowance.

During a later conversation in Durban, Dr. Campbell said to his son George about Roy, &quot;I suppose the silly little ass has married someone worthless.&quot; George responded, &quot;No fear! He has married someone a thousand times too good for him! I would have done the same if I could.&quot;

Campbell would have two daughters with Mary: Anna and Teresa.

==Poet, satirist and critic==
===London to Wales===
After their wedding, the Campbells moved into a rented flat above the Harlequin Restaurant. As Dr. Samuel Campbell had cut off his son&#x27;s allowance, Roy and Mary made ends meet by pawning their wedding gifts. Campbell also earned some money as a literary critic.

At first, Campbell suffered from jealousy and once dangled Mary out of the window after she expressed an attraction to a female friend. Campbell later told an exaggerated version of the incident and said he had dangled Mary out the window to show her that &quot;any marriage in which the wife wears the pants is an unseemly farce.&quot;

Meanwhile, Jacob Epstein was still convinced that Campbell was sexually involved with both Mary and her sister Kathleen. In order to gather proof of the orgies that he believed were taking place in the Campbells&#x27; flat, Epstein hired the Harlequin Restaurant&#x27;s waiters to spy on them. When Campbell learned of Epstein&#x27;s actions, he was outraged. One evening when Epstein and Kathleen Garman were dining together at the Harlequin, Campbell and Epstein engaged in a brawl on the floor above the restaurant. Both men stopped fighting at the shouts of Kathleen. 

During a 1944 conversation inside the Eagle and Child pub in Oxford, Campbell told the story of the brawl to C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien and claimed to have put Epstein in hospital for a week.

To escape the notoriety caused by the brawl, Roy and Mary Campbell moved from London to Ty Corn, a small converted stable three miles from the village of Aberdaron in Gwynedd, Wales. The Campbells stayed at Ty Corn for more than a year and lived off a diet of homegrown vegetables, sea-birds&#x27; eggs, and game birds that Roy poached with a small shotgun. These were supplemented by fish, lobsters and crabs purchased from Welsh fishermen. During the winter, Roy had to carry one hundred pounds of coal every week from the road, which was two miles away. Roy and Mary would read poetry aloud to each other by firelight. They were, as Campbell later wrote, living &quot;under the continual intoxication of poetry&quot;.

During their stay in Ty Corn, the Campbells&#x27; first daughter, Teresa, was born, with the assistance of a Welsh midwife, on the night of 26 November 1922. Campbell later wrote, &quot;I have not seen anything to equal the courage of my wife in fighting through this fearful night, when the wind blew the tiles off our roof and the rain and wind rushed in headlong.&quot; In later years, Teresa was fond of telling friends how she had been born in a Welsh stable and always added, &quot;I weighed ten pounds, my mother nearly died having me, I was so big.&quot; According to Peter Alexander, &quot;Campbell, unable to be present, sheltered behind a piece of corrugated iron on the beach, and suffered fearful sympathetic pain. At dawn, as the storm abated, he went out and shot a snipe, and grilled it on a spit for Mary&#x27;s breakfast.&quot;

===&quot;The Flaming Terrapin&quot;===
Campbell completed his first long poem, &quot;The Flaming Terrapin&quot;, a humanistic allegory of the rejuvenation of man, at Ty Corn in early September 1922. After making several copies &quot;in a beautiful, printed hand&quot;, Campbell mailed one to his Oxford friend Edgell Rickword. Rickword replied, &quot;I have waited three days and three nights to be able to tell you quite coolly that the poem is magnificent. One doesn&#x27;t often find anything to overwhelm one&#x27;s expectations but this did completely... I know of &quot;no one living&quot; who could write in such a sustained and intense poetical manner... Lots of things might have weighed against my liking it (particularly your philosophy of sweat) but the sheer fecundity of images ravished my lady-like prejudices ... Good luck and ten thousand thanks for such a poem.&quot;

After also receiving a copy of &quot;The Flaming Terrapin&quot;, artist Augustus John showed it to T. E. Lawrence who wrote, &quot;Normally rhetoric so bombastic would have sickened me. But what originality, what energy, what freshness and enthusiasm, and what a riot of glorious imagery and colour! Magnificent I call it!&quot; Lawrence was so impressed by &quot;The Flying Terrapin&quot; that he mailed a postcard to the future publisher of his memoir &quot;The Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot;, Jonathan Cape urging Cape to &quot;Get it – it&#x27;s great stuff.&quot;

By mid-1923, the Campbells had moved back to London at the urging of Mary&#x27;s mother, who felt that Ty Corn was no place to raise a child. In their flat at 90 Charlotte Street, Campbell received a letter from Cape, who was requesting to see &quot;The Flying Terrapin&quot;. Campbell hand delivered the manuscript the following day. When Cape read the poem, he decided to publish it. It was published in May 1924.

&quot;The Flaming Terrapin&quot; established Campbell&#x27;s reputation as a rising star and he was favourably compared to T. S. Eliot&#x27;s recently released poem &quot;The Waste Land&quot;. His verse was well received by Eliot himself, Dylan Thomas, Edith Sitwell and many others.

===&quot;Voorslag&quot; affair===
Returning to South Africa with Mary in 1925, Campbell started &quot;Voorslag&quot;, a literary magazine with the ambition to serve as a &quot;whiplash&quot; (the meaning of the title in Afrikaans) on South African colonial society, which he considered &quot;bovine&quot;. Before the magazine was launched, Campbell invited William Plomer to help with it, and late in the year, Laurens van der Post was invited to become the magazine&#x27;s Afrikaans editor. &quot;Voorslag&quot; was, according to Joseph Pearce, one of the first bilingual literary journals published in South Africa.

In what anti-apartheid South African author Jack Cope has termed &quot;one of the most significant moral and intellectual revolts in the country&#x27;s literary history&quot;, Campbell, as editor of &quot;Voorslag&quot;, accused his fellow White South Africans of racism and parasitism upon the black population, whom Campbell said deserved racial equality. 

The first issue included a book review in which Campbell praised Plomer&#x27;s recent novel &quot;Turbott Wolfe&quot;. The novel depicted a white artist filling his studio with black women as his models and sexual partners, much to the outrage of the artist&#x27;s racist white neighbours. Plomer courted further controversy by ending his novel with an interracial marriage between a black man and a white woman. For these reasons, Plomer&#x27;s &quot;Turbott Wolfe&quot; had been dubbed &quot;A Nasty Book on a Nasty Subject&quot;, by the &quot;Natal Advertiser&quot;. In his review for &quot;Voorslag&quot;, Campbell praised &quot;Turbott Wolfe&quot; as &quot;just and true&quot;, but also criticised Plomer for dehumanising the white racists in his novel. Campbell wrote: 

Mr. Plomer has shown his white characters when acting under the influence of race-feeling, behaving with typical ferocity and injustice. But he fails to let them relax enough into their individual and comparative dignity. He keeps pointing at them all the time and nudging the reader. I have known many farmers who capable of the most callous and criminal behaviour to the blacks, were guilless sons of the soil, as innocent as sleeping babes, with devout souls and sky-blue eyes. Their cruelty and impulsiveness was not even remembered when they relapsed again into their individual rationality. This type is much more normal than the bloodthirsty type described by Mr. Plomer and it confronts one with a far more terrible enigma. If Mr. Plomer had realized this his satire would have been more devastatingly complete and he might have achieved a masterpiece.

Elsewhere in the same issue, Campbell &quot;attacked Colonial South Africa with unrestrained venom&quot;. He wrote that the white man&#x27;s racial superiority was &quot;a superstition which was exploded by science ten years ago and by Christianity two thousand years before.&quot; As a nation, he wrote that South Africa lagged &quot;three hundred years behind modern Europe and five hundred years behind modern art and science.&quot; Furthermore, he accused white South Africans of being little more than a nation of parasites. Campbell concluded: 

We have no excuse for our parasitism on the native and the sooner we realize it the safer for our future. We are as a race without thinkers, without leaders, without even a physical aristocracy working on the land. The study of modern anthropology should be encouraged as it would give us a better sense of our position in the family tree of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; – which is among the lower branches: it might even rouse us to assert ourselves in some less ignoble way than reclining blissfully in a grocer&#x27;s paradise and feeding on the labour of the natives.

Both &quot;Voorslag&quot; articles outraged the white population of Natal. In response, the magazine&#x27;s owner, Lewis Reynolds, informed Campbell that, in the future, his editorial control over &quot;Voorslag&quot; was going to be drastically limited. Campbell resigned in protest. Campbell found himself subjected to social ostracism by the whites of Durban and found that even members of his own family wanted nothing to do with him. Left destitute, Campbell asked his friend C. J. Sibbett, a wealthy Cape Town advertising executive, and asked for a gift of £50, so that he and his family could return to England. Campbell concluded, &quot;None of my relations will look at me because of the opinions I have expressed in &quot;Voorslag&quot;.&quot; Sibbett immediately sent Campbell the money.

Before leaving South Africa with his family in 1927, Campbell reacted to his ostracism by writing the poem &quot;The Making of a Poet&quot;: 
&lt;poem&gt;
In every herd there is some restive steer
Who leaps the cows and heads each hot stampede,
Till the old bulls unite in jealous fear
To hunt him from the pastures where they feed.

Lost in the night he hears the jungles crash
And desperately, lest his courage fail,
Across his hollow flanks with sounding lash
Scourges the heavy whipcord of his tail.

Far from the phalanxes of horns that ward
The sleeping herds he keeps the wolf at bay,
At nightfall by the slinking leopard spoored,
And goaded by the fly-swarm through the day.
&lt;/poem&gt;
Campbell also wrote &quot;Tristan da Cunha&quot;, and &quot;The Wayzgoose&quot;. &quot;The Wayzgoose&quot; was a mock epic lampoon, inspired by Alexander Pope and John Dryden in heroic couplets, which skewered the racism and philistinism of colonial South Africa. The latter poem included belligerent attacks against those who Campbell felt had wronged him in the controversy over &quot;Voorslag&quot;. &quot;The Wayzgoose&quot; was published in book form in 1928.

In a 1956 letter to Harvey Brit, who had accused Campbell of being a Fascist, Campbell wrote: &quot;I am an exile ... from my country because I stood up for fair play for the blacks – is that Fascism?&quot;

==Poet and war correspondent in Europe between the wars== 
===Bloomsbury and move to France===
Having returned to England, Campbell began to move in literary circles. Roy and Mary Campbell were installed as guests on the estate of Harold Nicolson and Vita Sackville-West and became involved with the Bloomsbury Group. A distrait Campbell ultimately learned, however, that his wife was engaged in a lesbian relationship with Vita and intended to leave him. Vita, however, was willing to continue the affair, but had no intention of having the committed and monogamous relationship sought by Mary Campbell.

Though initially on friendly terms with the Bloomsbury Group, a heartbroken Campbell remained at the Long Barn upon the Nicholson estate as his wife&#x27;s affair continued. His literary reviews and essays began to display an increasingly hostile opinion of Bloomsbury, whose poets and writers Campbell increasingly considered sexually promiscuous, snobbish, and anti-Christian.

According to Roger Scruton, &quot;Campbell began to see the three aspects of the new elite—sexual inversion, anti-patriotism, and progressive politics—as aspects of a single frame of mind. These three qualities amounted, for Campbell, to a refusal to grow up. The new elite, in Campbell&#x27;s opinion, lived as bloodless parasites on their social inferiors and moral betters; they jettisoned real responsibilities in favor of utopian fantasies and flattered themselves that their precious sensibilities were signs of moral refinement, rather than the marks of a fastidious narcissism. The role of the poet is not to join their Peter Pan games but to look beneath such frolics for the source of spiritual renewal.&quot;

In a positive review of Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s recent biography of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Campbell also expressed harsh criticism of the vocal contempt for the Victorian era shown by Bloomsbury writer Lytton Strachey in &quot;Eminent Victorians&quot;, &quot;When the next generation comes to reevaluate the standards of the present one, it is possible that they will react against us as violently as we have reacted against the Victorians. As we ridicule the Victorians for their prudishness and hypocrisy, so our children may come to regard our ostentatious of frankness as a rather feeble apology for our flabby sensuality, and ourselves as a generation of harmlessly undiscriminating old fogeys who were about as sheepish about our few virtues and enthusiasms as the Victorians were about their vices... In comparing our promiscuity and frankness with that of the eighteenth century they will not fail to notice the peculiar absence of zest or enjoyment in its pleasures, and the lack of intellectual or physical vitality, which distinguish the present generation.&quot;

Referring to the Bloomsbury Group as &quot;intellectuals without intellect&quot;, Campbell penned a verse satire of them entitled &quot;The Georgiad&quot; (1931). According to Joseph Pearce:

As with so much of Campbell&#x27;s satire, &quot;The Georgiad&#x27;s&quot; invective is too vindictive. It is all too often spoiled by spite. This underlying weakness has obscured the more serious points its author sought to make. Embedded between the attacks on Bertrand Russell, Marie Stopes, Vita Sackville-West, Virginia Woolf and a host of other Bloomsbury&#x27;s and Georgians are classically refined objections to the prevailing philosophy of scepticism, mounted like pearls of wisdom in the basest of metal. &quot;Nor knew the Greeks, save in the laughing page, The philosophic emblem of our age.&quot; [...] The &quot;damp philosophy&quot; of the modern world, as espoused by the archetypical modern poet, was responsible for the prevailing pessimism and disillusionment of the post-war world. In preaching such a philosophy, which was &quot;the fountain source of all his woes&quot;, the poet&#x27;s &quot;damp philosophy&quot; left him &quot;damp in spirit&quot;. Nihilism was self-negating. It was the philosophy of the self-inflicted wound. In the rejection of post-war pessimism and its nihilistic ramifications... Campbell was uniting himself with others, such as T.S. Eliot and Evelyn Waugh, who were similarly seeking glimmers of philosophical light amidst the prevailing gloom. In his case, as in theirs, the philosophical search would lead him to orthodox Christianity.

According to his daughter Anna Campbell Lyle, &quot;What put the finishing touches to his malaise at Long Barn, was coming across Virginia Woolf, crawling about under the bushes. She raised to his a face so ravaged by madness that he fled to London and thence to Provence, like Tam o Shanter pursued by the witches.&quot;

After Mary&#x27;s relationship with Vita crumbled, she joined him at Martigues, where the spouses reconciled in the early 1930s. Campbell&#x27;s French period saw the publication of, among other writings, &quot;Adamastor&quot; (1930), &quot;Poems&quot; (1930), &quot;The Georgiad&quot; (1931), and the first version of his autobiography, &quot;Broken Record&quot; (1934). In 1932, the Campbells retained the poet Uys Krige, who would go on to become a major figure in Afrikaans literature, as tutor to Tess and Anna. 

Campbell&#x27;s productive poetry writing during this time was stimulated by his reading of world literature. Particularly major influences at this time were &#x27;s French prose translations from the Hunkpapa Lakota poetry of Michawago, a son of Sitting Bull, whom Campbell later praised as, &quot;a very fine poet&quot;. Another major source of inspiration was the Occitan language poetry of Frédéric Mistral.

During this time, he and his wife Mary were slowly being drawn to the Roman Catholic faith, a process that can be traced in a sonnet sequence entitled &quot;Mithraic Emblems&quot; (1936).

===Move to Spain and return to Britain===
By the end of 1932, the Pound Sterling had devalued and it had become clear that Krige and the Campbells could no longer afford to live in France. During a discussion with Krige in the spring of 1933, Mary Campbell, &quot;who had read the memoirs of Saint Theresa of Avila when she was six and had a preconceived idea of everything Spanish&quot;, recommended moving to Spain.

In the autumn of 1933, a neighbour demanded compensation for a broken fence and Campbell felt unable to pay. Facing a suit, a debt, and the prospect of imprisonment, Campbell moved his family across the border into the Second Spanish Republic. They travelled by train to Barcelona, where they were joined a few days later by their children, Uys Krige, the children&#x27;s French governess, their dog Sarah, and whatever luggage they could carry between them. 

According to Anna Campbell Lyle, in 1933, the Barcelona pension where the Campbell family stayed was flooded with German Jews and other anti-Nazi political refugees, who held a traditional German Christmas celebration. At the same party, Uys Krige attended with a Catalan girlfriend and Anna Campbell Lyle danced a &quot;paso-doble&quot; on the table.

In a 1933 letter from Barcelona to his Provence friend Count &quot;Freddy&quot; de Fremenville, an enthusiastic Campbell wrote, &quot;How immensely rich Spanish literature is! I am reading Gongora, an extraordinarily modern poet though he lived between 1561 and 1612. He gave rise to the word Gongorismo, meaning, as far as I can make out, an accentuation of all the characteristics that distinguish Baroque art. He reminds me of Mallarmé, but is far greater. And Quevedo, what a satirist! Did you know that Cervantes was also a poet? I always thought he was one of us. We all miss you. When we are settled in our own house you must come and stay with us. I know you hate to travel, but one should see Spain before one&#x27;s death.&quot;

The family settled in Toledo. They were formally received into the Catholic Church in the small Spanish village of Altea in 1935. The English author Laurie Lee recounts meeting Campbell in the Toledo chapter of &quot;As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning&quot;, the second volume of his autobiographical trilogy.

In the months leading up to the Spanish Civil War there was much anti-clerical feeling among Spanish socialists and communists. According to Pearce: 

In March 1936 the anti-clerical contagion spreading across Spain reached the streets of Toledo, the ancient city in which the Campbells had made their home. Churches were burned in a series of violent riots in which priests and nuns were attacked. During these bloody disturbances, Roy and Mary Campbell sheltered in their house several of the Carmelite monks from the neighboring monastery. In the following weeks, the situation worsened. Portraits of Marx and Lenin were posted on every street corner, and horrific tales began to filter in from surrounding villages of priests being shot and wealthy men being butchered in front of their families. Toledo&#x27;s beleaguered Christians braced themselves for the next wave of persecution, and the Campbells, in an atmosphere that must have seemed eerily reminiscent of early Christians in the Catacombs of Rome, were confirmed in a secret ceremony, before dawn, by Cardinal Goma, the elderly Archbishop of Toledo and Primate of Spain. In July 1936, the civil war erupted onto the streets of Toledo, heralded by the arrival in the city of Communist militiamen from Madrid. With no one to defend them, the priests, monks, and nuns fell prey to the hatred of their adversaries. The seventeen monks from the Carmelite monastery were rounded up, herded into the street and shot. Campbell discovered their murdered bodies, left lying where they fell. He also discovered the bodies of other priests lying in the narrow street where the priests had been murdered. Swarms of flies surrounded their bodies, and scrawled in their blood on the wall was written, &quot;Thus strikes the CHEKA.&quot;

Campbell later immortalized the incident in his poem &quot;The Carmelites of Toledo&quot;.

On 9 August 1936, the Campbells boarded HMS &quot;Maine&quot;, which was evacuating British subjects to Marseilles. Within weeks, they were back in England. After the atrocities he had witnessed, Campbell was deeply offended by the generally pro-Republican sympathies in Britain, where large numbers of young men were volunteering for the International Brigades and where only British Catholics raised a dissident voice. While staying with his openly Stalinist in-laws at Binstead, Campbell was contacted by Oswald Mosley, the leader of the British Union of Fascists. In the fall of 1936, Percy Wyndham Lewis arranged a meeting between Mosley and Campbell. Campbell later recalled of the meeting, &quot;I not only refused Mosley&#x27;s and Lewis&#x27;s offer of a very high position and lucrative position in the Fascist party but explained that I was returning to the ranks to fight Red Fascism, the worst and most virulent variety, and that when the time came I was ready to fight Brown or Black Fascism and that I could (though badly disabled) knock both of their brains out there and then! I explained that I was only fighting as a Christian for the right to pray in my own churches, all of which (save 3) had been destroyed in Red Spain...I then asked for my coat and hat: Lewis has never forgiven it.&quot;

Soon after the meeting with Mosley, Campbell read &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; and said of Adolf Hitler, &quot;Good gracious! This man won&#x27;t do – he&#x27;s a teetotalitarian vegetarian!&quot;

===War correspondent and support for the Nationalists===

On 29 January 1937, the family set sail to Lisbon on the German vessel &quot;Niasa&quot;. In June 1937, Campbell left Portugal for Spain, going to Salamanca and then to Toledo, where he retrieved the personal papers of Saint John of the Cross from a hiding place in his former flat. Campbell then attempted to enlist in one of the Carlist militias, but was informed by Alfonso Merry del Val, the head of the Nationalist Press Service, that he could better serve as a war correspondent alongside Francisco Franco&#x27;s armies. Travelling on a journalist&#x27;s pass issued by Merry del Val, Campbell left Toledo on 30 June 1937 and was driven to Talavera, where he suffered a serious fall, twisting his left hip. The following day, the special car travelled southwards from the front, ending its lightning tour in Seville. This visit appears to have been Campbell&#x27;s only front line experience of the war. However, that would not keep him from later suggesting that he had seen far more action than he had. He did not fight for the Nationalists during the Spanish conflict, despite later claims.

Campbell&#x27;s glorification in both prose and verse of the Nationalist faction drew a poor reaction from influential literati throughout the Anglosphere, among whom the Spanish Civil War was widely seen as a conflict between Democracy and Fascism, and Campbell&#x27;s reputation has suffered considerably ever since. Campbell had been a strong opponent of Marxism for some time, and fighting against it was also a strong motivation. In the heroic couplets of his poem &quot;Flowering Rifle&quot;, Campbell mocked the combat deaths of Republican soldiers, praised the Nationalist faction for defending the Church, and accused Communists of committing far more heinous atrocities than any Fascist government. In a footnote attached to the poem, he declared, &quot;More people have been imprisoned for Liberty, humiliated and tortured for Equality, and slaughtered for Fraternity in this century, than for any less hypocritical motives, during the Middle Ages.&quot; Scholar Judith Lütge Coullie believes that Campbell &quot;was extremely naïve politically and thus did not grasp the implications of his support for the Party that defended the Catholic Church.&quot;

Roy Campbell&#x27;s preference for serving in a Carlist unit, however, is very revealing. According to Scottish historian Roger Hutchinson, Carlism as an ideology has very close similarities with 18th-century Jacobitism. This would further have appealed to Roy Campbell, whose maternal ancestors had fought in the Jacobite Army during the Rising of 1745 and who had grown up listening to Jacobite ballads being sung by his Scottish-born mother.

The Campbells vocal support of Franco and the Nationalist faction caused many left-wing poets, such as Stephen Spender, Louis MacNeice, and Hugh MacDiarmid, to label Campbell a Fascist. MacDairmand, a Scottish communist, wrote an angry response to Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Flowering Rifle&quot; entitled &quot;The Battle Continues&quot;. The second stanza included the lines:

&lt;poem&gt;
Franco has made no more horrible shambles
Than this poem of Campbell&#x27;s
The foulest outrage his breed has to show
Since the massacre of Glencoe!
&lt;/poem&gt;

Campbell&#x27;s acquaintance C. S. Lewis, who he had first met as an Oxford undergraduate, also attacked him in a poem titled &quot;To the Author of &quot;Flowering Rifle&quot;&quot;. In the poem, Lewis denounced Campbell&#x27;s &quot;lack of charity&quot; and called him a &quot;loud fool&quot; who had learnt the art of lying from the very Communists he so claimed to despise. Lewis further declared:

&lt;poem&gt;
—Who cares
Which kind of shirt the murdering Party wears?
&lt;/poem&gt;

In September 1938, the Campbell family went to Italy, where they stayed until the end of the Spanish Civil War. After the publication of &quot;Flowering Rifle&quot; in February 1939, they became popular in the higher echelons of Roman society. They returned to Spain in April 1939. On 19 May, Roy and Mary Campbell travelled to Madrid for the Victory Parade of Franco&#x27;s forces.

==During the Second World War==
At the outbreak of the Second World War, Campbell returned to Britain intending to volunteer for military service. In a subsequent poem, he expressed his elation and pride during the voyage from Spain when he saw the Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot; being towed into Gibraltar for repairs following combat against the German battleships and . He later wrote several similar poems in favour of the Allied cause.

During the Battle of Britain, Campbell served as an Air Raid Precautions warden in London. During the Blitz, he met and befriended Anglo-Welsh poet and fellow alcoholic Dylan Thomas, with whom he once ate a vase of daffodils in celebration of St. David&#x27;s Day. Although Campbell was over draft age and in bad physical shape, he finally managed to be accepted into the British Army. He was recruited into the Intelligence Corps because of his knowledge of foreign languages and began training as a private with the Royal Welch Fusiliers on 1 April 1942. Having completed basic training, Campbell was transferred in July to the I.C. Depot near Winchester, where he was trained in motorcycles. 

In February 1943, Campbell was promoted to sergeant and learned that he was being posted in the spring to British East Africa. On 5 May 1943, Campbell arrived at Nairobi and was attached to the King&#x27;s African Rifles, serving in a camp two miles outside the city. After having worked as a military censor, he was transferred in June to the 12th Observation Unit of the commando force being trained for jungle warfare against the Imperial Japanese Army. However, any hope of combat was thwarted when Campbell in late July suffered a new injury to his damaged hip in a fall from a motorcycle while training near Mount Kilimanjaro. He was sent to hospital in Nairobi, where the doctors examined an X-ray of his hips and declared him unfit for active service.

In the aftermath, Campbell was employed, between September 1943 and April 1944, as a coast-watcher, looking out for enemy submarines on the Kenyan coast north of Mombasa. During this period, he made several sojourns in hospital due to attacks of malaria. According to Pearce, &quot;During the long months of boredom on the Kenyan coast or in hospital in Mombasa, Campbell began to brood over his predicament. In particular, he began to resent the fact that, in spite of his efforts to fight against Hitler, he was still being branded a fascist for having supported Franco. He compared his own position as a volunteer in the armed services with the position of leading left-wing poets such as Louis MacNeice, Stephen Spender, W. H. Auden, and Cecil Day-Lewis, who had settled for &#x27;soft jobs&#x27; at home or, in the case of Auden, had emigrated to the United States at the first hint of the coming war.&quot;

On 2 April 1944, Roy Campbell was medically discharged from the British Army owing to chronic osteoarthritis in his left hip.Due to an administrative error, he was sent by sea to South Africa aboard the Free Dutch hospital ships &quot;Oranje&quot;. Here he saw his family, &quot;whom I hadn&#x27;t seen for eighteen years&quot;, and pondered as he sailed from the harbour on the growth of Durban from a little village upon his family&#x27;s first arrival in the 1850s into a large modern port city with multiple skyscrapers. Returning to Britain, after convalescing in a hospital in Stockport, Campbell rejoined his wife. Since their house in Campden Grove had been severely damaged in the Blitz, the Campbells lived for a time in Oxford with the Catholic writers Bernard and Barbara Wall.

On 5 October 1944, Campbell spent an evening with C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien at Magdalen College, Oxford. In 1962, Lewis recalled that he detested what he dubbed &quot;Campbell&#x27;s particular blend of Catholicism and Fascism&quot;. Before they met Campbell, according to Tolkien, Lewis, &quot;had taken a fair deal of port and was a little belligerent&quot;, and accordingly recited his poem &quot;To the Author of Flowering Rifle&quot; aloud, while Campbell laughed off the provocation. 

Tolkien, who was then hard at work writing &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, found their conversation with Campbell delightful. In a letter to his son Christopher, Tolkien compared Campbell to Trotter, a torture-crippled hobbit in his novel, who would be rewritten as Aragorn in later drafts. Tolkien described Campbell as follows, &quot;Here is a scion of an Ulster prot. family resident in S. Africa, most of whom fought in both wars, who became a Catholic after sheltering the Carmelite fathers in Barcelona — in vain, they were caught &amp; butchered, and R.C. nearly lost his life. But he got the Carmelite archives from the burning library and took them through the Red country. [...] However it is not possible to convey an impression of such a rare character, both a soldier and a poet, and a Christian convert. How unlike the Left – the &#x27;corduroy panzers&#x27; who fled to America [...]&quot;

According to Pearce, &quot;Yet, however much Lewis had been &#x27;shaken&#x27; by the meeting with Campbell and however much he loathed his politics, the three men parted amicably at the end of the evening. It was midnight when Tolkien and Campbell left Lewis&#x27;s rooms at Magdalen College with all three agreeing to meet again in the future.&quot; In the aftermath, Campbell joined Tolkien and Lewis at several meetings of the Inklings at Lewis&#x27;s flat and at The Eagle and Child pub, where Campbell&#x27;s &quot;poetry, political views, and religious perspectives caused quite a stir.&quot; According to Pearce, &quot;At these gatherings, Campbell and Lewis would continue to cross swords, although it would be their differences on literature rather than religion or politics that would fire the debate. The gist of their differences is encapsulated in one of Lewis&#x27;s poems, entitled simply, &quot;To Roy Campbell&quot;, in which he criticises Campbell for his negative attitude towards Romanticism. Interestingly, however, Lewis&#x27;s tone is far more friendly than in his violent lampoon &quot;To the Author of Flowering Rifle&quot;, suggesting that the two men had warmed to each other in subsequent meetings.&quot;

At the same time, T. S. Eliot contacted Campbell and expressed a desire to publish a new volume of hiss poetry for Faber and Faber. The two poets met regularly throughout 1945, discussing arrangements for a poetry collection which Campbell titled &quot;Talking Bronco&quot;, after Stephen Spender&#x27;s hostile review of &quot;Flowering Rifle&quot; in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. Campbell wrote &quot;a violently polemical preface&quot; and many verse satires in which he lashed out against left-wing poets MacNeice, Spender, Auden, Day-Lewis and MacDiarmid, whom he accused, among other things, of cowardice for refusing to &quot;join up&quot; during the war. Eliot dissuaded him from printing the preface. Campbell resisted Elliot&#x27;s efforts to convince him to remove the multiple poems that attacked the left-wing poets that were &quot;destined to cause great offense.&quot;

==Post-war life and career==
Following the end of the Second World War, Campbell&#x27;s poetry and literary translation began once again to attract an audience. While continuing to struggle with recurring bouts of the malaria he had contracted in British East Africa, Campbell closely befriended several disillusioned Republican veterans of Spanish Civil War, including Hamish Fraser, Hugh Oloff de Wet, and George Orwell. 

On 11 April 1949, Campbell &quot;continued his war of attrition against Spender&quot; by attending a poetry reading by the latter, which was being hosted by the Poetry Society at Bayswater. When Spender stepped up to the podium, Campbell shouted that he wished to &quot;protest on behalf of the Sergeant&#x27;s Mess of the King&#x27;s African Rifles.&quot; Campbell then stormed the stage and punched Spender in the face, which left the communist poet with a bloody nose. Campbell&#x27;s friends and family immediately removed him from the premises. Spender was urged to call the police and press charges but refused, saying, &quot;He is a great poet; he is a great poet. We must try to understand.&quot; He then insisted on finishing his poetry reading.

In a letter to the organizer of the event, Campbell wrote:

No doubt you will wonder at my reason for disturbing your session the other night. There was no other option left me by the speaker&#x27;s own announcement that he was going to denounce me from every public platform as &quot;a fascist, a coward, and a liar&quot; – merely because I had called attention to his war record. As I volunteered when over-age and while my own country (S. Africa) was still neutral, to fight fascism which is merely another form of communism ... I could not allow myself to be called a coward by one who during the struggle against fascism had employed no other weapon to the adversary than his own knife and fork and his highly lucrative but innocuous pen – while I was on ranker&#x27;s pay suffering malaria in the jungle.

Towards the end of 1949, Campbell began a friendship with poet Edith Sitwell. Their friendship began because of Campbell&#x27;s decision to defend Sitwell in print following an attack against her poetry by Geoffrey Grigson during a radio broadcast. When a grateful Sitwell invited Campbell to meet her for lunch, Campbell arrived, knelt down, kissed her hand, and said, &quot;Edith, my darling, you are a great lady! I will be your knight and fight your battles for you!&quot; Sitwell was deeply touched and later credited her friendship with the Campbells for her own conversion to Catholicism.

Spender later broke with the Communist Party of Great Britain and presented Campbell with the 1952 Foyle Prize for his verse translations of St. John of the Cross.

On 7 December 1951, Campbell&#x27;s new memoir &quot;Light on a Dark Horse&quot;, which his friend Dylan Thomas later dubbed &quot;this often beautiful and always bee-loud autobiography&quot;, was published &quot;to a mixed reception, scattered reviews, and disappointing sales.&quot; In his new autobiography, Campbell expressed his disgust for South Africa under Apartheid. In one passage, Campbell argued that treating the non-white majority as an underclass in their own country was not only immoral but destructive:

The present disqualification of the native from so many aids to his own betterment is exactly on a part with the natives&#x27; treatment of each other. We are behaving about a quarter as badly as the Zulus and Matabeles did to their fellow Bantu, and it will do us little more good than it did them... and we may end by ranking the majority of the population in violent opposition to the white minority, which happened in the mad revolution in Haiti, when the black Emperor, Jean Christope, out-Caesared Nero and Caligula in the name of Liberty and Equality. We must never forget that theoretical Bolshevism is the most attractive dream-bait that was ever invented. Though practical Bolshevism may be the most diabolical and cruel hook ever inserted into bait ... You can expect a rustic Zulu to be proof against the seductive blarney which completely seduced the &#x27;knowing and sophisticated&#x27; intellectuals of England and Western Europe for so many years.

On 1 May 1952, Campbell dined with fellow Catholic convert and satirist Evelyn Waugh. In a subsequent letter to Nancy Mitford, Waugh called Campbell &quot;a great beautiful simple sweet natured savage&quot;, and said that he felt &quot;quite dizzy from his talking to me.&quot; A few days later, Campbell had lunch with fellow South Africans Laurens van der Post, Enslin du Plessis, Uys Krige, and Alan Paton. During the lunch, the five men composed and signed an open letter to the South African Government, in which they denounced the ruling National Party&#x27;s plans to disenfranchise Coloured voters. The letter was subsequently published by several South African newspapers.

On 9 May 1952, the Campbells moved to Linhó, Sintra, on the Portuguese Riviera. In Portugal, Campbell completed his translations of the complete poems of Charles Baudelaire. In a foreword that appeared when his translations of &quot;Les Fleurs du mal&quot; was published by Pantheon Books in London, Campbell described his recent successful translations of Saint John of the Cross and explained, &quot;I determined to translate a fellow sinner, who was hardly less a believer, even in his blasphemous and rebellious moments, than the Saint himself. I have been reading Baudelaire since I was fifteen, carried him in my haversack in two wars and loved him longer and more deeply than any other poet.&quot; Campbell further compared himself to Baudelaire, saying that they both shared, &quot;similar sins, remorses, ostracisms, and poverty and the same desperate hope of reconciliation and pardon.&quot;

Campbell then spent the rest of 1952 translating Eça de Queirós&#x27; novel &quot;Cousin Basilio&quot; into English from the original Portuguese.

In October 1953, Campbell embarked aboard the MS &quot;Vulcania&quot; at Lisbon for a voyage to Halifax, Nova Scotia followed by a lecture tour of Canada and the United States. The tour had been suggested and organised by John Sutherland, a well-known Canadian poet, literary critic, and editor of the Montreal-based literary magazine &quot;Northern Review&quot;, whom Campbell had already been corresponding with for quite some time. Sutherland later felt that the tour was largely a success, though it did cause protests to be organised by members of the American and Canadian Communist Parties against Campbell&#x27;s allegedly &quot;Fascistic opinions&quot;.

===South Africa===
In December 1953, Campbell learned that the University of Natal wished to confer an honorary doctorate upon him. Overjoyed &quot;at this belated recognition from his native land&quot;, Campbell began planning what would be his final visit to South Africa. When Campbell arrived in Durban on 18 March, he was greeted by his brother George, his former schoolmaster Cecil (Bill) Payn, and many other friends and acquaintances, who swept him off to a rowdy party. While staying with his elderly mother, Campbell wrote to his friend Rob Lyle, &quot;I&#x27;m sitting on my mother&#x27;s stoep overlooking Pietermaritzburg, Table Mountain, and the Valley of a Thousand Hills. From her back stoep you can see the Drakensburg range, Cobalt and indigo taking up the whole horizon with incredible rock formations ... like rampaging dragons and saw-toothed dinosaurs. Nearer, bright green and yellow, forests and crags, are the Kaarkloof and Inthloraan ranges.&quot; 

The honorary degree was awarded in a graduation ceremony at Pietermaritzburg City Hall on 20 March 1954. At the ceremony, Campbell abandoned his carefully prepared notes and instead of giving &quot;the dignified discussion of poetry his audience expected, he trotted out all his political hobby-horses.&quot; Campbell shocked his primarily Anglo-African audience with a vigorous denunciation of both the United Kingdom and the British Empire. Though Campbell denounced South African Prime Minister D. F. Malan and the white supremacist National Party for what he called &quot;the dangerous and suicidal plight of our country,&quot; Campbell&#x27;s speech was interpreted by his hearers as a defense of apartheid. Campbell&#x27;s audience also listened with mounting horror as he dubbed Winston Churchill &quot;a valiant but superannuated Beefeater,&quot; and Franklin Delano Roosevelt &quot;a tittering zombie&quot;, for having given Eastern Europe to Joseph Stalin during the Yalta Conference. Campbell also characteristically praised the anti-communist government of Spain under Franco.

In a letter written the following day to Rob Lyle, Campbell echoed the political opinions expressed in his speech, but also accused D. F. Malan and the National Party of Anti-Catholicism. Campbell also expressed a belief, however, that critics of apartheid were guilty of hypocrisy if they did not also condemn racial segregation and Jim Crow Laws in the American South, where he alleged the racist repression was much worse. In a letter to Edith Sitwell, Campbell once again dubbed Churchill a &quot;valiant but stupid beefeater&quot; and Roosevelt &quot;a tittering zombie&quot; but also &quot;a criminal moron if ever there was one.&quot; Campbell also expressed anger that &quot;Franco, the only man who ever fooled Stalin and Hitler has been called a puppet.&quot; According to Pearce, Campbell &quot;also claimed, in an amazing example of selective and wishful thinking, that Spain, Portugal, and Ireland were all, &#x27;run on papal encyclicals by kindly people.

In a letter from their farm in Portugal, Mary Campbell wrote, &quot;All I know is that I have had enough of being quite alone here, and I am &quot;longing&quot; for you to come back.&quot; Campbell replied, &quot;I am longing to see you my beloved – but this is the last time I will ever set eyes on my beloved country (how I love it!) so let me take in all I can before I finish with it.&quot; Before he left South Africa for the last time, Campbell spent a week fishing with his brother on the coast near Port Edward and attended his sister Ethel&#x27;s funeral. During a trip to Hluhluwe game reserve, Campbell&#x27;s attempt to secure a photograph of himself bullfighting a black rhinoceros with his duffelcoat ended disastrously. He also visited Portuguese Mozambique and Zululand taking photographs of the wildlife.

===Final years and death===
Campbell returned to his home in Portugal on 14 May 1954. He learned that his daughter Tess had been seeing a man named Ignatius Custodio and that, due to her pregnancy, a rushed wedding was being planned. Even though Custodio was &quot;bitterly anti-clerical&quot;, he grudgingly agreed to Tess&#x27; insistence on having a Roman Catholic Nuptial Mass, which took place on 7 August 1954. Within two weeks, however, Custodio deserted Tess for another woman. After the birth of his grandson, Campbell wrote to Charles Ley in February 1955, &quot;Tess&#x27;s baby is doing fine. His name – Francisco. The father called him after Frank Sinatra: but we say we called him after the Caudillo.&quot;

During the summer of 1954, Campbell found himself again sick with malaria and spent much time in bed translating verse dramas from the Spanish Golden Age for the BBC. During the 1950s, Campbell was also a contributor to &quot;The European&quot;, a magazine published in France and edited by Diana Mosley. &quot;The European&quot; could also boast contributions from Ezra Pound and Henry Williamson. 

After Campbell&#x27;s conversion to Catholicism, he wrote spiritual verse. He also wrote travel guides and children&#x27;s literature. He began translating poetry from languages such as Spanish, Portuguese, Latin, and French. Among the poets he translated were Spanish poet Francisco de Quevedo, the Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa, the Brazilian poet Manuel Bandeira, the Ancient Roman poet Horace, and the Nicaraguan poet Rubén Darío. Campbell also produced translations into English of Federico García Lorca, a Spanish poet, outspoken Marxist, and homosexual, who was abducted and murdered by the Nationalists at the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. In a self-deprecating poem titled &quot;On the Martyrdom of F. Garcia Lorca&quot;, Campbell wrote:

&lt;poem&gt;
Not only did he lose his life
By shots assassinated:
But with a hammer and a knife
Was after that—translated.
&lt;/poem&gt;

At the time of his death, Campbell was working on translations of 16th- and 17th-century Spanish plays. Although only the rough drafts were completed, Campbell&#x27;s work was posthumously edited for publication by Eric Bentley under the title, &quot;Life Is a Dream and Other Spanish Classics&quot;.

Campbell died in a car accident near Setúbal, Portugal, on Easter Monday, 1957. The Campbells were returning home from attending Easter Sunday in Seville. According to his daughter Anna Campbell Lyle: 

Mary was deeply religious and it was a great happiness to her to know that Father had died two days after receiving the Sacrament on Easter Sunday, so that he was in a State of Grace when his soul left his body. Father was buried in the cemetery of São Pedro in Sintra (the Cintra of Byron&#x27;s &quot;Childe Harold&quot;) on the 26th. I often go there to take flowers to his tomb in which Mary now lies. This is not to be their last resting place. The South Africans want their greatest poet to be buried in what was, when all is said, the part of the planet he loved most.&quot;

According to South African Campbell scholar Judith Lütge Coullie, however, inquiries about efforts to repatriate Roy and Mary Campbell&#x27;s remains to South Africa &quot;have drawn a blank. It is unlikely, however, to be a priority in post-Apartheid South Africa.&quot;

==Literary style==
Much of Campbell&#x27;s verse was satirical and written in heroic couplets, a form otherwise rare in 20th-century English verse. Rhymed verse was generally his favoured medium. One modern assessment of his poetry is that &quot;he was vigorous in all he wrote, but not distinctly original.&quot;

This is Campbell celebrating fertility and sexuality, in an extract from &quot;The Flaming Terrapin&quot; (1924):

&lt;poem&gt;
Maternal Earth stirs redly from beneath
Her blue sea-blanket and her quilt of sky,
A giant Anadyomene from the sheath
And chrysalis of darkness; till we spy
Her vast barbaric haunches, furred with trees,
Stretched on the continents, and see her hair
Combed in a surf of fire along the breeze
To curl about the dim sierras, where
Faint snow-peaks catch the sun&#x27;s far-swivelled beams:
And, tinder to his rays, the mountain-streams
Kindle, and volleying with a thunderstroke
Out of their roaring gullies, burst in smoke
To shred themselves as fine as women&#x27;s hair,
And hoop gay rainbows on the sunlit air.
&lt;/poem&gt;

On the subject of nature, Campbell produced poetry such as this in his &quot;The Zebras&quot; (1930):

&lt;poem&gt;
From the dark woods that breathe of fallen showers,
Harnessed with level rays in golden reins,
The zebras draw the dawn across the plains
Wading knee-deep among the scarlet flowers.
The sunlight, zithering their flanks with fire,
Flashes between the shadows as they pass
Barred with electric tremors through the grass
Like wind along the gold strings of a lyre.

Into the flushed air snorting rosy plumes
That smoulder round their feet in drifting fumes,
With dove-like voices call the distant fillies,
While round the herds the stallion wheels his flight,
Engine of beauty volted with delight,
To roll his mare among the trampled lilies.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Edith Sitwell wrote: &quot;Roy Campbell was one of the very few great poets of our time. His poems are of great stature, and have a giant&#x27;s strength and power of movement. They have, too, an extraordinary sensuous beauty. Everything is transformed to greatness.&quot;

==Legacy==
In a 2012 article for the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, Tim Cartwright wrote, &quot;Roy Campbell, in the opinion of most South African literary people, is still the best poet the country has ever produced.&quot; Cartwright added, &quot;In later life, when Alan Paton set out to write Campbell&#x27;s biography, it was Mary Campbell&#x27;s absolute refusal to discuss [her affair with Vita Sackville-West] that led to Paton&#x27;s abandoning the book. Paton, quite rightly, regarded this as the turning point in Campbell&#x27;s life.&quot;

Meanwhile, Campbell&#x27;s satirical poetry mocking the Marxism, Nihilism, narcissism, and promiscuity of the British intelligentsia caused him to be a very controversial figure throughout the English-speaking world during and long after his lifetime.

Furthermore, Campbell&#x27;s similar attacks in both &quot;Voorslag&quot; and &quot;The Wayzgoose&quot; of what he saw as the racism, philistinism, and parasitism of White South Africans made Campbell an equally controversial figure in South Africa under apartheid.

In his 1982 book, &quot;The Adversary Within: Dissident Writers in Afrikaans&quot;, anti-apartheid South African author Jack Cope praised &quot;the &quot;Voorslag&quot; Affair&quot;, as &quot;one of the most significant moral and intellectual revolts in the country&#x27;s literary history.&quot; Cope further praised Campbell, William Plomer, and Laurens van der Post, saying, &quot;Their brief but glorious sortie helped to break up the smug and comfy little bushveld camp of colonial English writing which had been sending up its pipe fumes, coffee scents, and smoke screens for a century past.&quot;

Furthermore, through his friendship and mentorship of Afrikaner poet Uys Krige, Campbell&#x27;s legacy also includes an enormous influence over the subsequent development of Afrikaans literature. Also according to Jack Cope, Krige&#x27;s linguistic and literary talents, his passion for French, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese literature, and having absorbed the literary translation philosophy of Campbell made Krige the greatest translator of poetry from Romance languages into Afrikaans during the 20th century. In addition to his acclaimed translations of both European and Latin American poetry, Krige also translated many of the works of William Shakespeare into Afrikaans from Elizabethan English.
Krige would also go on to become a literary and political mentor to the many young Afrikaans language poets and writers of the literary movement known as the Sestigers, which Louise Viljoen, in her biography of poet Ingrid Jonker, has described as nothing less than &quot;a cultural revolt&quot; against apartheid and the National Party from within &quot;the heart of Afrikanerdom.&quot; Due in large part to Krige&#x27;s influence, membership in the Afrikaner intelligentsia in South Africa under Apartheid became synonymous with opposition to the South African Government.

Elsewhere, however, although Campbell&#x27;s translations of the French Symbolist poets Charles Baudelaire and Arthur Rimbaud have been reprinted in a few modern poetry anthologies, Campbell&#x27;s support for Francisco Franco&#x27;s Nationalists during the Spanish Civil War has caused him to continue being labelled as a Fascist and blacklisted from the vast majority of other poetry anthologies and university literature courses.

According to his daughters and his biographer Joseph Pearce, however, Campbell&#x27;s opposition to the Second Spanish Republic was based on personal experience with both Republican war crimes and with the systematic religious persecution that targeted both the clergy and laity of the Catholic Church in Spain. Also according to Pearce, Campbell&#x27;s verse satires, which his wife and daughters often begged him to stop writing, were modelled after the very similar poetry published in 17th- and 18th-century England by satirists John Dryden and Alexander Pope, who in turn had modelled &quot;their&quot; poems upon the satirical verse of Ancient Roman poets Gaius Lucilius, Catullus, Martial, and Juvenal.

Other scholars have also made efforts to restore Roy Campbell&#x27;s reputation and his place in World Literature.

For example, in a 1968 lecture at Harvard University, Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges praised Campbell&#x27;s translations of the mystical Christian poetry of St. John of the Cross. Borges called Campbell &quot;a great Scottish poet who is also South African&quot;, and cited Campbell&#x27;s renderings of St. John&#x27;s poetry as an example of how literary translation can produce superior works of poetry to the original poems in the original language.

Furthermore, Campbell may be credited with bringing the traditions of mock epics and satirical poetry in heroic couplets from the lifetimes of John Dryden and Alexander Pope into the 20th century and with updating both traditions accordingly. In this regard, Campbell continues to have followers, particularly in the literary movement within American poetry known as New Formalism.

In 1981, American poet and satirist R. S. Gwynn, a native of North Carolina, published one of the best known examples, &quot;The Narcissiad&quot;. Literary critic Robert McPhillips has dubbed Gwynn&#x27;s &quot;The Narcissiad&quot; &quot;a Popean mock epic lambasting contemporary poets&quot;.

Dana Gioia has also written of &quot;The Narcissiad&quot;, &quot;Formal and satiric, this mock epic in heroic couplets pilloried the excesses of contemporary American poetry by recounting the adventures of Narcissicus, an ambitious but talentless poet. In Gwynn&#x27;s mercilessly satiric tale American poets simultaneously realize that to achieve artistic fame in the overcrowded field of contemporary verse they must kill all competitors. After a series of outrageous comic battles fought by recognisable caricatures of fashionable American poets, Narcissus ineptly triumphs. Gwynn&#x27;s irreverent poem cannot have pleased the irreverent targets of his humor, but it enjoyed a lively underground life and has been repeatedly reprinted.&quot;

When &quot;The Narcissiad&quot; takes aim at confessional poetry, Gwynn used a level of invective that would have made Campbell proud:

:&quot;Our Younger Poet, weaned early from his bottle,
:Begins to cast about for a role-model
:And lacking knowledge of the great tradition,
:Pulls from the bookstore shelf a slim edition
:Of &quot;Poems of Now&quot;, and takes the offered bait,
:And thus becomes the next initiate.
:If male he takes his starting point from Lowell
:And fearlessly parades his suffering soul
:Through therapy, shock-treatments, and divorce
:Until he whips the skin from a dead horse.
:His female counterpart descends from Plath
:And wanders down a self-destructive path
:Laying the blame on Daddy while she guides
:Her readers to their template suicides –
:Forgetting in her addled state, alas,
:Her all-electric oven has no gas.&quot;

Furthermore, the essays which comprise American Catholic literary critic and poet James Matthew Wilson&#x27;s 2016 book &quot;The Fortunes of Poetry in an Age of Unmaking&quot; were inspired by Wilson&#x27;s experiences while attending a convention of the Modern Language Association during the early 2000s. During the convention, a female scholar praised Anglo-Irish novelist Elizabeth Bowen for being an only child and used Bowen to attack &quot;purveyors of hate,&quot; like Patrick J. Buchanan, who have praised having large families. Another scholar praised Irish playwright Samuel Beckett and used &quot;the famous inaction and infertility,&quot; within Beckett&#x27;s plays to denounce the Roman Catholic Church for discouraging disparity of cult marriages and for similarly encouraging large families. Wilson commented, &quot;Much like the Bowen scholar before him, he seemed interested in his author primarily as a means of striking a blow against birth.&quot;

In response, Wilson writes that he was reminded of Roy Campbell&#x27;s mockery of similar ideas among the British intelligentsia of the 1930s in the poem &quot;The Flowering Rifle&quot;. In the poem, Campbell vowed to &quot;flaunt Truth:

:Before the senile owl-roosts of our youth
:Whom monkeys&#x27; glands seem powerless to restore,
:As Birth Control was profitless before,
:Which sponsored by their mockery of a Church,
:Like stranded barbels, left them in the lurch,
:Whose only impact on the world&#x27;s affairs, 
:Has been to cause a boom in Rubber shares,
:Who come to battle with both arms held up
:And ask to be invited home to sup –
:While back at home, to sound their battle-horn,
:Some self-aborted pedants stray forlorn
:And pity those who venture to be born.&quot;

==In popular culture==
*The character of Zulu Blades in Wyndham Lewis&#x27; 1930 novel &quot;The Apes of God&quot;, is modeled after Campbell.
*Another fictionalized version of Campbell, under the name &quot;Rob McPhail&quot;, appears in the 1932 novel &quot;Snooty Baronet&quot; by Wyndham Lewis. Campbell was reportedly happy to appear in the novel but was disappointed that his character was killed off by being gored to death while bullfighting.
*German aggrotech band C-Drone-Defect used Campbell&#x27;s literary translation of Charles Baudelaire&#x27;s poem &quot;Le Rebelle&quot; as the lyrics for the song &quot;Rebellis&quot; on their 2009 album &quot;Dystopia&quot;.

<text>That Was Then, This Is Now is a coming-of age, young adult novel by S. E. Hinton, first published in 1971. Set in the 1960s, it follows the relationship between two brothers, Mark Jennings and Bryon Douglas, who are foster brothers, but find their relationship rapidly changing and deteriorating. The book was later adapted into a 1985 film starring Emilio Estevez and Craig Sheffer.

== Plot ==
The novel is set in Tulsa, Oklahoma in the 1960s. Mark and Bryon have been living together as brothers since the death of Mark&#x27;s parents. The two often spend time hanging out at the local bar and playing pool to earn money, along with a strange boy named M&amp;M. The novel begins with Bryon&#x27;s mother in the hospital getting surgery, which causes financial stress for the family. The boys are forced to look for jobs, but do not have much success. Bryon asks the bartender, Charlie, for a job but is refused because he is underage. Meanwhile, the financial strife at home grows worse and Bryon&#x27;s mother is hospitalized again. Mark soon begins bringing in suspicious amounts of money at home, but does not tell Bryon where the money is coming from. 

Soon, Bryon starts dating a girl named Cathy, who is M&amp;M’s sister. The pair attend a dance together, where Mark and Ponyboy Curtis get in a fight with a boy who Bryon’s ex-girlfriend, Angela, told to beat the two up. Mark is injured on his head and gets stitches.

Later, Mark and Bryon decide they need money. They go to Charlie’s bar and play pool, and in this game they beat two Texans. While leaving, the two Texans approach the boys in an alleyway and threaten them with a gun. Charlie comes out, saving the pair but simultaneously getting shot and killed.

The next few months, Bryon spirals and ponders about Charlie’s death. Cathy tells Bryon about her worries and suspicions of M&amp;M doing drugs while on a car ride. The pair pick up M&amp;M as well as Mark, and go out to eat. While driving back, M&amp;M requests to be dropped off at a specific location. Once out of the car, he says he’s not coming home. Cathy resists, but Bryon assures her it is fine and they drive away, in hopes of coming back for him. Once back, they find M&amp;M to be missing.

For the next few weeks, Cathy and Bryon stress about M&amp;M’s disappearance. After a night of drinking with Mark, Bryon reduces into drunk tears. Mark claims to know where M&amp;M is, to which Bryon expresses hope. The next day, Mark takes Bryon to a “hippie house,” where he is known as Cat. The residents of the house claim to not have seen M&amp;M for a few days, and the pair leave the house. 

Previously, Bryon and Mark had picked up Angela, and while she was sleeping, Mark cut all her hair off as revenge for almost getting him killed. In the next week, Tim and Curly Shepard, Angela’s brothers, beat up Bryon since they think he is the one who has done this. Cathy visits Bryon, and he tells her about the house. 

Later, Bryon drives Cathy to the house in order to find M&amp;M. They find him while he is in a high state; he yells and cries out frantically. After taking him to the hospital, the doctor says he may never return to how he was.

After Bryon returns home, he finds a bottle of pills under Mark’s mattress. He comes to the conclusion that Mark is selling the drugs in order to make money. He calls the police, and confronts Mark.

Over the next few months, Bryon spirals. Cathy and him have broken up, and Mark is a reformatory, or juvenile detention. Without anyone in his life, Bryon regrets his past actions, including turning in Mark. He ponders about a life in which things were different, and wishes he was a kid again.

== Connections to other books by S.E. Hinton ==
The book, like &quot;Rumble Fish&quot;, takes place in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Hinton&#x27;s hometown and the setting of her first book, &quot;The Outsiders&quot;. However, unlike &quot;Rumble Fish&quot;, Ponyboy Curtis, the main character in &quot;The Outsiders&quot;, appears in &quot;That Was Then, This Is Now&quot; and even takes part in the events surrounding the dance.

The characters of Tim and Curly Shepard from &quot;The Outsiders &quot; also appear, as does their sister Angela, who is original to &quot;That Was Then, This Is Now&quot;. Randy, who was in &quot;The Outsiders&quot;, also appears as a Hippie in this book, which is appropriate to those who have read or seen &quot;The Outsiders&quot;, as Randy is an affluent kid who feels guilty about the class division and becomes repulsed by it. In &quot;Tex&quot;, Mark and Cathy appear, who are original to &quot;That Was Then, This Is Now&quot;. Smokey, who is original to &quot;Rumble Fish&quot;, is mentioned by Mark.

Mark later appears as a hitchhiker, who has recently escaped from prison and killed multiple people. He forces Tex and Mason to drive him to the state line, holding them at gunpoint; he is killed soon after by the police. 

Cathy appears as Tex&#x27;s English teacher at school, Ms. Carlson. When Mark dies, she goes to his funeral, which makes Tex wonder why. When he asks her, Cathy says that they weren&#x27;t exactly friends, but she knew him for a long time and they shared a past.

<text>Logo TV (often shortened to Logo, and stylized as Logo.) is an American basic cable channel owned by Paramount Media Networks, a division of Paramount Global. Launched in 2005, Logo was originally dedicated to lifestyle and entertainment programming targeting LGBTQIA2S+ audiences. It replaced VH1 MegaHits in the United States.

The channel&#x27;s availability peaked at 53.2 million US households in September 2013, but has steadily been dropped by various cable and streaming providers thereafter, falling to 21.7 million households by December 2023.

== History ==
The channel launched June 30, 2005, as the first advertiser-supported commercial television channel in the United States geared towards the gay community. It was founded by former MTV executive Matt Farber. Its first president, Brian Graden, was named by &quot;Out&quot; as the 15th most powerful gay person in America in 2007. Logo replaced VH1 MegaHits when it was launched.

The fact that the LGBT-themed channel was named &quot;Logo&quot; led some viewers to think the &quot;l&quot; and the &quot;g&quot; referenced &quot;lesbian&quot; and &quot;gay&quot;, but according to company executives, the name does not represent anything, nor is it an acronym. The channel&#x27;s website says:
Logo struck carriage deals prior to its launch date with DirecTV, Charter Communications, Adelphia Communications Corporation, Cablevision, Time Warner Cable, and RCN Corporation. The broadcaster reached a deal with Comcast after the launch date. Logo also partnered at the time with CBS News to provide news briefs and had a marketing agreement with LPI Media, publisher of &quot;The Advocate&quot;, &quot;Out&quot;, and &quot;Out Traveler&quot; magazines. MTV Networks and Time Warner Cable announced an agreement December 11, 2006, to expand its distribution of Logo to additional markets. Logo became available on Dish Network in May 2009 (in HD only) as part of an add-on package.

In April 2011, Logo acquired the rights to air the British comedy series &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; and co-produced the show&#x27;s three revival specials during 2011 and 2012 with the BBC and BBC America. Logo aired the episodes in a heavily edited format, while BBC America aired the episodes in its entirety.

The network announced on February 21, 2012, that it would change its programming strategy. Citing research that indicated that LGBT people were becoming increasingly less likely to prioritize highlighting their sexual orientation or identity, the channel entered into partnerships to produce programs that focused less on LGBT-specific interests and more on general cultural and lifestyle subjects.

Day-to-day operations were handled by Lisa Sherman, who was executive vice president and general manager until her resignation in October 2013. While the reach of the channel grew steadily in the United States during the early 2010&#x27;s, increasing from 44.6 million pay television households in January 2010 to 53.2 million in September 2013, it was steadily dropped by various cable and streaming providers thereafter, falling to availability in 21.7 million households by December 2023.

== Programming ==

Logo&#x27;s programming was initially a blend of movies, reality television, travel programming, dating &amp; romance shows, documentaries, music videos, comedy, news, and syndicated programs that either had queer characters or were popular among queer viewers.

Since 2017, the network&#x27;s main programming serves as a complementary flank to TV Land, airing older sitcoms from the 1970s to 1990s. In line with Viacom&#x27;s 2017 restructuring plan, the network no longer produces any new programming outside of content for its social media pages. &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot; moved to sister network VH1 that year, with Logo now only airing reruns and simulcasts of the show and its spinoffs.

Logo also previously operated a collection of websites under the LOGOonline umbrella name. &quot;NewNowNext&quot;, a pop culture news and trends blog, remained the only active website owned by the network until July 2022, when it was merged into &quot;Logo News&quot;; the URL now redirects to other company properties.

<doc id="680092" wikidata="Q4804923" url="?curid=680092" title="Asheville School">
<text>Asheville School is a private university-preparatory boarding school in Asheville, North Carolina founded in 1900. The campus sits on amid the scenic Blue Ridge Mountains and currently enrolls 295 students in grades nine through twelve. The campus was named by Architectural Digest magazine in 2018 as the most beautiful private school campus in North Carolina. In 2015, the school was ranked the seventh best boarding school in the U.S. by independent education organization TheBestSchools.org.

==History==

Asheville School was founded in 1900 by Charles Andrews Mitchell and Newton Mitchell Anderson. Previously, the pair founded the University School in Cleveland, Ohio in 1890. Fifty-three male boarding students from grades five through twelve called &quot;forms&quot; were enrolled in the school&#x27;s first year.

==Academics==

Asheville School&#x27;s academic course of study stresses a core curriculum of the humanities, sciences, mathematics, foreign language, and the arts.

Asheville School has a humanities program structured in a series of four year-long courses: Ancient Studies, World Studies, European Studies, and American Studies. The academic program focuses heavily on writing and ends with a final research project, the Senior Demonstration. The project requires seniors to produce one ten-page paper on a topic of their choosing and complete an oral defense for twenty minutes.

==Mountaineering==

Asheville School has a mountaineering program where students can participate in backpacking, rock climbing, whitewater kayaking, snow skiing, caving, and mountain biking. Many students take mountaineering as an afternoon activity for daily on-campus instruction and practice. On-campus facilities include a high-ropes course, an Alpine Tower, a bouldering wall, a swimming pool (for kayak instruction), and of forested land with miles of trails for biking and exploring. Pupils go on trips to places such as Looking Glass Rock in Pisgah National Forest, the Tuckasegee and French Broad rivers, and the Tsali Recreational area. Early leaders of the outdoors program were mountaineering leaders Pop Hollandsworth and Vince Lee.

==Community life==

The Asheville School student body is made up of approximately 80% boarding students and 20% day students. The school has students from twenty-six states and thirteen countries. Roughly a quarter of the students receive need-based financial aid. The school has about the same number of males and females.

Boarding students live in one of three dormitories: Lawrence Hall, Anderson Hall, and Kehaya House.

The school community gathers several times a week for chapel services and convocations. Sixth formers are required to deliver a ten-minute talk alongside another student, an event that (along with the Senior Demonstration) represents the capstone of a student&#x27;s career at Asheville School.

The community service requirement–one that is common among boarding schools–differs at Asheville in that students complete 40 hours of service for one organization and submit an essay about that experience to the headmaster.

==Traditions==

The football rival of Asheville School (the Blues) is Christ School (the Greenies). At Asheville School, the rivalry game is preceded by a week of festivities that culminates in a pep rally the evening before the Blues take the field. The Asheville School/Christ School rivalry represents North Carolina&#x27;s longest-running high school athletic rivalry.

==Notable alumni==
Notable alumni of Asheville School include:

* Roberts Blossom – theatre, film and television character actor, and poet

<doc id="680094" wikidata="Q262589" url="?curid=680094" title="Tewodros II">
<text>Tewodros II (, once referred to by the English cognate Theodore; baptized as Kassa, – 13 April 1868) was Emperor of Ethiopia from 1855 until his death in 1868. His rule is often placed as the beginning of modern Ethiopia and brought an end to the decentralized Zemene Mesafint (Era of the Princes).

Although Tewodros II&#x27;s origins were in the Era of the Princes, his ambitions were not those of the regional nobility. He sought to re-establish a cohesive Ethiopian state and to reform its administration and church. 

Tewodros II&#x27;s first task after having reunited the other provinces was to bring Shewa under his control. During the Era of the Princes, Shewa was, even more than most provinces, an independent entity, its ruler even styling himself Negus, the title for King. In the course of subduing the Shewans, Tewodros took with him a Shewan prince, Sahle Maryam, who he brought up as his own son, who would later become Emperor (or Atse) himself as Menelik II. Despite his success against Shewa, Tewodros faced constant rebellions by nobles in other regions resisting modernization. He ultimately committed suicide at the Battle of Magdala, during the British Expedition to Abyssinia.

In the first six years of his reign, the new ruler managed to put down these rebellions, and the empire was relatively peaceful from about 1861 to 1863, but the energy, wealth, and manpower necessary to deal with regional opposition limited the scope of Tewodros&#x27;s other activities. 
Tewodros II never realized his dream of restoring a strong monarchy, although he took many important initial steps. He sought to establish the principle that governors and judges must be salaried appointees. He also established a professional standing army, rather than depending on local lords to provide soldiers for his expeditions. He introduced the collection of books in the form of a library, tax codes, as well as a centralized political system with respective administrative districts. He also intended to reform the church but he was confronted by strong opposition when he tried to impose a tax on church lands to help finance government activities. Tewodros confiscation of these lands gained him enemies in the church and little support elsewhere. Essentially, Tewodros was a talented military campaigner.

== Description ==

The British Consul Walter Plowden knew well the political events of Ethiopia during the 1850s and had foretold the rising star of Kassa the freelance warrior from Qwara.

When being crowned as King, Plowden described him as such:

The French explorer, geographer, ethnologist, linguist and astronomer Antoine Thomson D&#x27;Abbadie describes him during his stay in Ethiopia:

Georg Wilhelm Schimper the German botanist had mentioned the following about Tewodros:
The French traveler Émile Jonveaux, described him as: The Négus Theodore, King of the kings of Ethiopia, had none of the insignia of sovereign majesty. Clothed very simply, he handled the pickaxe and the hammer like the lowest of his workmen, with the view of encouraging them by his example. He was in all things the man of energy, the fierce hero, of whom M. Lejean, who knew him intimately enough to call him his &quot;terrible friend,&quot; has traced so life-like a portrait. He was about fifty years of age; of medium stature, with muscular limbs, a swarthy complexion, and features of remarkable beauty.The British geographer Clements Markham, mentioned the following about him:He was a genius, and a very remarkable one. It is a misuse of terms to call him a savage, except in the sense that Peter the Great was a savage. They were both born kings of men; both endowed with military genius; both lovers of the mechanical arts; both possessed of dauntless courage; and, while capable of noble and generous acts, both were frequently guilty of perpetrating most horrible atrocities.

== Early life ==
Kassa Hailu was born in Qwara west of Gondar, his father was an Amhara nobleman of the Qwara district named Hailegiorgis Woldegiorgis. His paternal grandfather, Dejazmatch Woldegiorgis, was a widely respected figure of his time. Dembiya was part of the large territory known as &quot;Ye Maru Qemas&quot;, which translates as &quot;the taste of the honey&quot; or literally &quot;What has been tasted by Maru&quot;. This name was given to the territory because it was the personal fief of &quot;Dejazmach&quot; Maru, a powerful warlord, and relative of Kassa. When Maru died in October 1827, his fiefdom was given (albeit begrudgingly) to Dejazmach Hailu by the governor of the province, Empress Menen Liben Amede. Kassa was in line to potentially take control of &quot;Ye Maru Qemas&quot; after Kenfu&#x27;s death (though Kenfu also wanted to give the land to his own sons). When Kenfu died, however, neither his sons nor Kassa inherited control of the territory because Empress Menen Liben re-annexed it under her own control.

According to the Ethiopian chronicles, Kassa&#x27;s mother, Woizero Atitegeb Wondbewossen, was from Gondar and belonged to a noble family. However, According to Hormuzd Rassam, she was originally from Amhara Sayint. Her mother, &quot;Woizero&quot; Tishal, was a member of a noble family of Begemder, while her paternal grandfather, &quot;Ras&quot; Wodajo, was a powerful and highly influential figure. It is thought that Tewodros II&#x27;s paternal side of the family carried with it a slim margin of Solomonic pedigree, however insignificant it proved when compared to the more prominently illustrious ancestries of some of his highborn rivals. Tewodros, in his reign, indeed claimed that his father was descended from Emperor Fasilides by way of a daughter.

When Kassa was very young, his parents divorced and &quot;Woizero&quot; Atitegeb moved back to Gondar taking her son with her. Not long after their departure, however, news reached them that Kassa&#x27;s father had died. Popular legend states that Kassa&#x27;s paternal relatives split up the entire paternal inheritance, leaving young Kassa and his mother with nothing and in very dire circumstances financially. In hard times, his enemies came up with a rumour that she was reduced to selling Kossoa claim for which Kassa would go on to imprison Henry Aaron Stern for publishing during his reign. There is actually no evidence that Woizero Atitegeb was ever a Kosso seller, and several writers such as Paulos Ngo Ngo have stated outright that it was a false rumor spread by her detractors. Evidence indicates that Woizero Atitegeb was fairly well-to-do, and indeed had inherited considerable land holdings from her own illustrious relatives from which to lead a comfortable life. Kassa&#x27;s youth was probably not lived lavishly, but he was far from a pauper.

Kassa was sent to school at the convent of Tekla Haymanot, between Gondar and Lake Tana. He took refuge when it was sacked by a defeated Dejazmatch Wube, who by burning and dismembering the children, took vengeance on their victorious parents. Kassa escaped and fled to the protection of his kinsman, &quot;Dejazmach&quot; Kenfu Hailu, probably his uncle, but believed to be his half-brother. He continued his formal education and became familiar with the Bible and Ethiopian literature. He also received instruction on the techniques of Ethiopian warfare from Kenfu. When Kenfu died, and his two sons were defeated by another &quot;dajazmach&quot; (earl), Dajazmach Goshu of Damot and Gojjam, Kassa was forced to make another start in life, and offered his services to Goshu.
Later, Kassa would confront and decisively defeat Dejazmatch Wube —the very man whose earlier actions had set him on this new path and was the last person he had to defeat thus allowing to take on his kingly name Tewodros II

==Rise to power==

Kassa Hailu was born into a country rife with civil war, and he defeated many regional noblemen and princes before becoming emperor during time known as the Zemene Mesafint or &quot;Age of the Princes&quot;. During this era, regional princes, and noble lords of diverse ethnic and religious backgrounds vied with each other for power and control of the Gondarine Emperor. A puppet Emperor of the Solomonic dynasty was enthroned in Gondar by one nobleman, only to be dethroned and replaced by another member of the Imperial dynasty when a different regional prince was able to seize Gondar and the reins of power. Regions such as Gojjam and Shewa were ruled by their own branches of the Imperial dynasty and, in Shewa, the local prince went as far as assuming the title of King. In Wollo, competing royal powerful Oromo and Muslim dynasties also vied for power. Nevertheless, a semblance of order and unity was maintained in northern Ethiopia during the era of the Princes by the powerful Rases of the Were Sheik dynasty of Wollo such as Ras Ali the Great and Ras Gugsa who controlled Gondar and the Emperor.

Kassa began his career in this era as a &quot;shifta&quot; (outlaw), but after amassing a sizable force of followers, was able to not only restore himself to his father&#x27;s previous fiefdom of Qwara but was able to control all of Dembiya. Moreover, he gained popular support by his benevolent treatment of the inhabitants in the areas he controlled: according to Sven Rubenson, Kassa &quot;shared out captured grain and money to the peasants in Qwara and told them to buy hoes and plant.&quot; This garnered notice of the nobleman in control of Gondar, Ras Ali II of Yejju of Wollo. Empress Menen Liben Amede, wife of Emperor Yohannes III, and the mother of Ras Ali, arranged for Kassa to marry her granddaughter, Tewabech Ali. She awarded him all of Ye Meru Qemas in the hopes of binding him firmly to her son and herself.
Although all sources and authorities believe that Kassa truly loved and respected his wife, his relationship with his new in-laws deteriorated largely because of the disdainful treatment he repeatedly received from the Empress Menen. By 1852, he rebelled against Ras Ali and, in a series of victories – Gur Amaba, Takusa, Ayshal, and Amba Jebelli – over the next three years he defeated every army the Ras and the Empress sent against him. At Ayshal he captured the Empress Menen, and Ras Ali fled. Kassa announced that he was deposing Emperor Yohannes III, and then marched on his greatest remaining rival, Dejazmach Wube Haile Maryam of Semien. Kassa refused to acknowledge an attempt to restore the former Emperor Sahle Dengel in the place of the hapless Yohannes III who had acknowledged Kassa immediately. Yohannes III was treated well by Kassa who seems to have had some personal sympathy for him. His views on Sahle Dengel are not known but are not likely to have been sympathetic. Following the defeat of Dejazmach Wube, Kassa was crowned Emperor by Abuna Salama III in the church of Derasge Maryam on February 11, 1855. He took the throne name of Tewodros II, attempting to fulfill a prophecy that a man named Tewodros would restore the Ethiopian Empire to greatness and rule for 40 years.

==Military skills==
Tewodros II&#x27;s military career started when he served in his relative, Kenfu Haile Giorgis&#x27;, army. In 1837, he led a successful attack on Ottoman forces in the town of Gallabat and fought in the Battle of Wadkaltabu where he helped defeat an Egyptian raid. His uncle, Dejazmach Kenfu died in 1839 and Qwara was lost to the family and claimed by Empress Menen of Gondar. Kassa Hailu resorted to become a shifta, one who refuses to recognize his feudal lord. Kassa Hailu organized his own army in the plains of Qwara. When he became too powerful to ignore, as a way to deal with him without using force, he was named Dajazmach of Qwara and given the hand of Tawabach, the daughter of Ras Ali of Begemder, in 1845.

Kassa was very close to Tawabach and devoted to his marriage but his submission to Empress Menen was short-lived. In October 1846, he attacked and plundered Dembea, a city located due south of Gondar, and in January 1847 he went on to occupy Gondar. When Kassa unoccupied Gondar later that year, Empress Menen sent an army after him into north of Lake Tana. Kassa easily defeated the army and took the Empress as prisoner. Her son, Ras Ali of Begemder, chose to negotiate with Kassa; he gave Kassa all lands west and north of Lake Tana and Kassa in return released his mother (Prouty and Rosenfeld 1982, 60). The reconciled relationship with Empress Menen led him to join up with Ras Ali and Ras Goshu Zewde of Gojam. However, when conflict re-emerged yet again in 1852, Kassa retreated back to Qwara to re-strengthen his troops.

In 1842 Tewodros invaded Egyptian-controlled Sudan from western Ethiopia, successfully capturing Metemma. However, he suffered a major defeat in March 1848 at the Battle of Dabarki, effectively ending his invasion. The defeat at Dabarki led to Tewodros taking efforts to modernize his military, incorporating firearm drills and more modern artillery.

==Reign==

Tewodros sought to unify and modernise Ethiopia. However, since he was nearly always away on campaign during his tenure as emperor, disloyal leaders frequently tried to dislodge him while he was away fighting. Within a few years, he had forcibly brought back under direct Imperial rule the Kingdom of Shewa and the province of Gojjam. He crushed the many lords and princes of Wollo and Tigray and brought recalcitrant regions of Begemder and Simien under his direct rule.

He moved the capital city of the Empire from Gondar, first to Debre Tabor, and later to Magdala. Tewodros ended the division of Ethiopia among the various regional lords and princes that had vied among each other for power for almost two centuries. He forcibly re-incorporated the regions of Gojjam, Tigre, Shewa and Wollo under the direct administration of the Imperial throne after they had been ruled by local branches of the Imperial dynasty (in Gojjam and Shewa) or other noblemen (Wollo). With all of his rivals apparently subdued, he imprisoned them and their relatives at Magdala. Among the royal and aristocratic prisoners at Magdala was the young Prince of Shewa, Sahle Maryam, the future Emperor Menelik II. Tewodros doted on the young prince, and married him to his own daughter Alitash Tewodros. Menelik would eventually escape from Magdala, and abandon his wife, offending Tewodros deeply.

The death of his beloved wife, Empress Tewabech, marked the start of a deterioration in Tewodros II&#x27;s behavior. Increasingly erratic and vengeful, he gave full rein to some of his more brutal tendencies now that the calming influence of his wife was absent. For instance, after the murder of the English traveller, John Bell, who had become the emperor&#x27;s close friend and confidante, the emperor, in revenge, had 500 prisoners beheaded in Debarek. Then, in February 1863, after defeating the rebel, Tedla Gwalu, Tewodros ordered the killing of the 7,000 prisoners he had taken.

Tewodros II remarried, this time to the daughter of his imprisoned enemy Dejazmach Wube. The new Empress, Tiruwork Wube was a proud and haughty woman, very aware of her illustrious Solomonic ancestry. She is said to have intended on the religious life and becoming a nun, especially after the fall of her father and his imprisonment along with her brothers at the hands of Tewodros II. However, Tewodros&#x27; request for her hand in marriage was seen by her family as an opportunity to get Dejazmatch Wube and his sons freed from imprisonment, and so they prevailed on her to marry the Emperor. However, while the conditions of their imprisonment were eased, Dejazmatch Wube and his sons were not released, deeply imbittering Empress Tiruwork against Tewodros. Already feeling that she had married far beneath her dignity to a usurper, the failure of the Emperor to free her family did not help their marital relationship. The marriage was very far from a happy one, and was extremely stormy. They did have a son, Dejazmatch Alemayehu Tewodros, whom the Emperor adored and whom he regarded as his heir.

By October 1862, Emperor Tewodros&#x27; position as ruler had become precarious, much of Ethiopia was in revolt against him, except for a small area stretching from Lake Tana east to his fortress at Magdala, Ethiopia. He was engaged in constant military campaigns against a wide array of rebels. Likewise, Abyssinia was also threatened by the encroachment of Islam as Muslim Turks and Egyptians repeatedly invaded Ethiopia from the Red Sea and from Sudan while the Muslim Oromo tribe was expanding throughout Central Ethiopia. Tewodros wrote a letter to Queen Victoria as a fellow Christian monarch, asking for British assistance in the region. Tewodros asked the British Consul in Ethiopia, Captain Charles Duncan Cameron, to carry a letter to Queen Victoria requesting skilled workers to come to teach his subjects how to produce firearms, and other technical skills. Cameron traveled to the coast with the letter, but when he informed the Foreign Office of the letter and its contents, he was instructed to simply send the letter to London rather than take it himself. He was to proceed to Sudan to make inquiries about the slave trade there. After doing this, Cameron returned to Ethiopia.

On Cameron&#x27;s return, the Emperor became enraged when he found out that Cameron had not taken the letter to London personally, had not brought a response from the Queen, and most of all, had spent time traveling through enemy Egyptian and Turkish territories. Cameron tried to appease the Emperor saying that a reply to the letter would arrive shortly. The Foreign Office in London did not pass the letter to Queen Victoria, but simply filed it under &quot;Pending&quot;. There the letter stayed for a year. Then the Foreign Office sent the letter to India, because Abyssinia came under the Raj&#x27;s remit. It is alleged that when the letter arrived in India, officials filed it under &quot;Not Even Pending&quot;.

Britain had several reasons for ignoring the letter. The British Empire&#x27;s interests in Northeast Africa were quite different from those of Tewodros. The British did not want to conduct a Christian &quot;crusade&quot; against Islam but instead to cooperate politically, strategically and commercially with the Ottoman Empire, Egypt and the Sudan. This was not only to protect the route to India but also to ensure that the Ottoman Empire continued to act as a buffer against Russia&#x27;s plans for expansion into Central Asia. More so, as a result of the American Civil War, deliveries of cotton from the American South to the British textile industry were cut off entirely, making the British increasingly dependent on Egyptian-Sudanese cotton. The British did not wish to see a conflagration in the region which would upset the status quo.

After two years had passed and Tewodros had not received a reply, he imprisoned Cameron, together with all the British subjects in Ethiopia and various other Europeans, in an attempt to get the queen&#x27;s attention. His prisoners included an Anglican missionary named Henry A. Stern, who had previously published a book in Europe describing Tewodros as a barbaric, cruel, unstable usurper. When Tewodros saw this book, he became violently angry, pulled a gun on Stern, and had to be restrained from killing the missionary. He then beat to death the two servants Stern had brought with him. Tewodros also received reports from abroad that foreign papers had quoted these European residents of Ethiopia as having said many negative things about him and his reign.

==Conflict with Great Britain==


The British sent a mission under an Assyrian-born British subject, Hormuzd Rassam, who bore a letter from the Queen (in response to Tewodros&#x27; now three-year-old letter requesting aid). He did not bring the skilled workers as Tewodros had requested. Deeply insulted by the British failure to do exactly as they were asked, Tewodros had the members of the Rassam mission added to his other European prisoners. This last breach of diplomatic immunity was the catalyst to Britain launching the 1868 Expedition to Abyssinia under Robert Napier. He traveled from India, then a British colony, with more than 30,000 personnel (a force of 13,000 troops and 26,000 camp followers), which consisted of not only soldiers but also specialists such as engineers. Tewodros had become increasingly unpopular over the years due to his harsh methods, and many regional figures had rebelled against him. Several readily assisted the British by providing guides and food as the expeditionary force marched towards Magdala, where the Emperor had fortified the mountaintop.

The British force defeated the Abyssinian army at Arogye, on the plain facing Magdala, on 10 April 1868. With Tewodros&#x27; army so decisively defeated, many of his men began to desert and the emperor was left with only 4,000 soldiers. Tewodros II attempted to make peace. Napier responded with a message thanking him for this peace offering and stating that he would treat the Emperor and his family with every dignity. Tewodros II furiously responded that he would never be taken prisoner. The British shelled Magdala, which killed most of Tewodros&#x27;s remaining soldiers. Tewodros released all the Europeans unharmed but ordered 300 Ethiopian prisoners to be flung over the cliff.

On 15 April 1868, as the British troops stormed the citadel of Magdala, Emperor Tewodros committed suicide rather than surrender. 

A modern commentator states &quot;When Tewodros preferred self-inflicted death to captivity, he deprived the British of this ultimate satisfaction and laid the foundation for his own resurrection as a symbol of the defiant independence of the Ethiopian.&quot;
He has been said to have used a pistol which he had used during fighting for unification during the era, though in reality he used a duelling pistol gifted to him by Queen Victoria and presented by Consul Cameron. Tewodros II was buried by the British troops at Magdala&#x27;s Medhane Alem (Savior of the World) Orthodox Church under the name of Theodore II. In 2019 the National Army Museum announced the return to Ethiopia of a lock of Tewodros&#x27; hair, taken after his death in battle.
Magdala was in the territory of the Muslim Oromo tribes who had long before taken it from the Amhara people; however Tewodros had won it back from them some years earlier. Two rival Oromos queens, Werkait and Mostiat, had both allied themselves with the British and claimed control of the conquered fortress as a reward. Napier much preferred to hand Magdala over to the Christian ruler of Lasta, Wagshum Gobeze, because if Gobeze were in control of the fortress, he would be able to halt the Oromos advance and assume responsibility for over 30,000 Christian refugees from Tewodros&#x27;s camp. Yet as Gobeze was unresponsive to these overtures, much preferring to acquire Tewodros&#x27;s cannons, and the two Oromo queens could not reach an arrangement, Napier decided to destroy the fortress. After a thorough medical examination which confirmed Tewodros&#x27; death as the result of suicide, the body was dressed and laid out in a hut. By the request of the Emperor&#x27;s widow, the body was later buried in the Church of Magdala. Lieutenant Stumm, an eyewitness, described the discovery of Tewodros&#x27;s body:


After Tewodros has been buried, Napier allowed his troops to loot the citadel as a punitive measure; according to historian Richard Pankhurst, &quot;fifteen elephants and almost 200 mules were required to carry away the booty&quot;. These became dispersed in museums and state collections across Europe, though some looted artifacts have been returned to Ethiopia. Tewodros II&#x27;s family later moved the Emperor&#x27;s remains to the Mahedere Selassie Monastery in his native Qwara, where they remain to this day. 
Tewodros had asked his wife, the Empress Tiruwork Wube, in the event of his death, to put his son, Prince Alemayehu, under the protection of the British. This decision was apparently made in fear that his life would be taken by any aspirant for the empire of Abyssinia. In accordance with these wishes, Alemayehu was taken to London where he was presented to Queen Victoria, who took a liking to the young boy. Alemayehu later studied at Cheltenham College, the Rugby School and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. However, both the Queen and Napier were later concerned with the subsequent development of the young prince who became increasingly lonely, unhappy and depressed during this time. In 1879, the prince died at the age of 19. He was buried near the royal chapel in Windsor with a funeral plaque placed to his memory by Queen Victoria.
On a curious side note, many of the hostages were unhappy with Napier&#x27;s demand that they leave the country. Several hostages argued that they had long since become alienated from their old homeland in Europe and would no longer have any chance of building a new life for their families there. The German observer Josef Bechtinger, who accompanied the expedition, wrote:
Most of them, instead of thanking Providence for their final rescue – were not all happy with the new turn of events. They were indignant, upset, at having to leave Abyssinia. &quot;What&quot; they said, &quot;are we supposed to do in Europe now, what are we supposed to do now with our wives and children back in our homeland – which has become alien to us? How are we supposed to live now among people who have [become] alien to us and whom we no longer like? What are we supposed to live on?
Bechtinger reported that many of them eventually returned to their adopted country from Suez by way of Massawa.
Following some short squabbles for the throne after his death, Tewodros II was eventually succeeded by Yohannes IV as the next Emperor of Ethiopia.

==Heirs==

The widowed Empress Tiruwork and the young heir of Tewodros, Alemayehu, were also to be taken to England. However, Empress Tiruwork died on the journey to the coast, and little Alemayehu made the journey alone. The Empress was buried at Sheleqot monastery in Tigray where her ancestors ruled. Although Queen Victoria subsidised the education at Rugby of Dejazmatch Alemayehu Tewodros, Captain Tristram Speedy was appointed as his guardian. He developed a very strong attachment to Captain Speedy and his wife. However, Prince Alemayehu grew increasingly lonely as the years went by, and his compromised health made things even harder. He died in October 1879 at the age of 19 without seeing his homeland again. Prince Alemayehu left an impression on Queen Victoria, who wrote of his death in her journal: &quot;It is too sad! All alone in a strange country, without a single person or relative belonging to him... His was no happy life&quot;.
Emperor Tewodros II had an elder son born outside of wedlock, named Meshesha Tewodros. Meshesha was frequently at odds with his father, especially after it was learned that he had assisted Menelik of Shewa in his escape from Magdala. When Menelik became Emperor of Ethiopia, Meshesha Tewodros was raised to the title of Ras and given Dembia as his fief. Ras Meshesha would remain a loyal friend of Emperor Menelik II until his death, and his descendants were regarded as among the highest nobility and the leading representatives of Tewodros&#x27; line.

Tewodros II&#x27;s much loved daughter, Woizero Alitash Tewodros, was the first wife of Menelik of Shewa who eventually became Emperor Menelik II of Ethiopia. Woizero Alitash was abandoned by her husband when Menelik escaped from Magdala to return and reclaim his Shewan throne. She was subsequently remarried to Dejazmatch Bariaw Paulos of Adwa. When Menelik II was proclaimed Emperor of Ethiopia at Were Illu in Wollo shortly after the death of Yohannes IV, Woizero Alitash was among the first of the nobility to travel to Were Illu to pay homage to her former husband as the new Emperor. Rumors persist that Alitash and Emperor Menelik may have rekindled their relationship and that Alitash found that she was pregnant by the Emperor in the following months. The rumors continue that upon hearing about this pregnancy of the Emperor&#x27;s first wife, the childless and barren Empress Taytu Bitul had Alitash poisoned. Yet a different version of these rumors state that she gave birth to a boy and handed him over to a friend to be raised as a common farmer in Shewa. The eldest descendant of this line now resides in Kenya married to the daughter of a Jegna, some Ethiopians believe them to be the only legitimate heirs to the line of Tewedros II and Menelik II. Regardless of the veracity of these rumors, Woizero Alitash Tewodros, daughter of Tewodros II, died within the first few months of the reign of her ex-husband Menelik II.

==In popular culture==

* Emperor Tewodros has come to occupy a high regard amongst many Ethiopians. Examples of his influence are seen in plays, literature, folklore, songs and art works (such as a 1974 book by Sahle Sellassie). Emperor Tewodros has come to symbolise Ethiopian unity and identity.Tsegaye Gebre-Medhin wrote his play &#x27;Tewodros&#x27; in 1963. Chronicles of his life have been seen to be significant in the formation of Amharic and Ethiopian literature in English.
* Tewodros, under the name Theodore, appears in George MacDonald Fraser&#x27;s fictionalised account of the 1868 conflict, &quot;Flashman on the March&quot;, where he is portrayed as a volatile, bloodthirsty madman.
* Karen Mercury&#x27;s historical fiction &quot;The Four Quarters of the World&quot; (Medallion Press, 2006) depicts the rise and fall of Tewodros as seen through the eyes of his European captives, using primary sources from eyewitnesses to create an unbiased portrait of the Emperor.
*&quot;When the Emperor Dies&quot; by Mason McCann Smith is another work of historical fiction based around the rise, reign and fall of Emperor Tewodros.
* Philip Marsden&#x27;s &quot;The Barefoot Emperor&quot; chronicles the life and times of Emperor Tewodros&#x27;s quest for power and his reign. Marsden remarks that Tewodros&#x27;s violence makes him ambiguous to be a true hero worthy of a bronze statue like Napier in London.
* Tewodros features prominently in Alan Moorehead&#x27;s historical survey &quot;The Blue Nile&quot;.
* John Pridham composed and published a piano solo piece, &quot;Abyssinian Expedition&quot;, commemorating the Battle of Magdala. The digitized (scanned) sheet music can be found at the National Library of Australia&#x27;s website.
* Emperor Tewodros appears as the leader of the Ethiopians in Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition – The African Royals.
* Tewodros II has been posthumously named in landmarks, buildings, institutions or public space.
* Romanian writer Mircea Cărtărescu published a novel called &quot;Theodoros&quot;, where he narrates a fictional story about Theodoros&#x27; life.

==Facilities==
===Heritage Hall===
Heritage Hall is one of the central buildings and a historical site on the SAIT campus.

Construction began on Heritage Hall on January 18, 1921, five years after the Provincial Institute of Technology and Art (PITA) was formed in Calgary in 1916. Designed by Alberta provincial architect Richard Palin Blakey and built by J. McDiarmid Company of Winnipeg, the three-storey modern structure&#x27;s focal point is the central entrance flanked by two large towers designed with the characteristics of Collegiate Gothic architecture, which was prevalent throughout North America at the time. Despite the prevalence of Collegiate Gothic architecture in post-secondary education, Heritage Hall is the only example in Calgary. Heritage Hall was completed later in 1922 and accommodated both the PITA and the Calgary Normal School. During the Second World War, the structure was used as a wireless training school for the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. The structure was intentionally situated on Calgary&#x27;s North Hill to maximize the structure&#x27;s visibility throughout Calgary, and also provide a view of the city from the building. The building was originally known as the &quot;Provincial Institute of Technology Building and Normal School&quot; and was renamed &quot;Heritage Hall&quot; in 1985.

On May 31, 1985, the Government of Alberta designated Heritage Hall a provincial historic resource under the &quot;Historical Resources Act&quot;. The citation for the historical designation notes the integral role the structure and SAIT played in the development of post-secondary education in Alberta, and the significant architectural value of the Collegiate Gothic design.

On June 24, 1987, the Government of Canada designated Heritage Hall a national historic site under the name &quot;Heritage Hall Southern Alberta Institute of Technology National Historic Site of Canada&quot;. The federal designation notes the importance of the structure and SAIT as a place in the development of vocational education in Western Canada. The designation references only the footprint of Heritage Hall and not the entire SAIT campus.

===Residence===
SAIT Residence has two modern high rises in the northeast corner of its main campus. The residence buildings provide visitors with access to amenities during their stay including on-site laundry, 24-hour security, utilities, and shared lounge space.

===Campus Centre===
The Campus Centre contained a coffee house, bar, Jugo Juice, gymnasium, fitness centre, squash courts, bowling alley, hockey arena, salt water pool and theatre. This building has been decommissioned, and demolition is currently in progress. Construction of a new Campus Centre is expected to be complete by 2025.

===Stan Grad Centre===
This central building on SAIT&#x27;s main campus houses food service outlets, study areas, classrooms, the campus bookstore and the library.

=== Additional buildings on campus ===

* Clayton Carroll Automotive Centre
* Aldred Centre
* John Ware building
* E.H. Crandell building
* Cenovus Energy Centre
* Johnson-Cobbe Energy Centre
* Senator Burns building
* Eugene Coste building

SAIT has been a member of the Alberta Colleges Athletic Conference since 1964. The SAIT Trojans are represented basketball, curling, soccer, cross country running, hockey and volleyball. All of SAIT&#x27;s sports teams share the name Trojans.

<doc id="680100" wikidata="Q2627030" url="?curid=680100" title="A Little Less Conversation">
<text>&quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot; is a 1968 song recorded by American singer Elvis Presley, written by Mac Davis and Billy Strange and published by Gladys Music, Inc., originally performed in the film &quot;Live a Little, Love a Little&quot;. The song became a minor hit in the United States when released as a single with &quot;Almost in Love&quot; as the A-side. A 2002 remix by Dutch musician Junkie XL of a later re-recording of the song by Presley became a worldwide hit, topping the singles charts in nine countries and was awarded certifications in ten countries by 2003.

The song has made numerous appearances in popular culture and has been covered by several artists.

==Original recordings==
&quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot; was first recorded on March 7, 1968, at Western Recorders in Hollywood, California, and released on a single backed by &quot;Almost in Love&quot;, another song from the movie. The song was not released on an LP until November 1970, when it was included on the RCA Camden budget label LP &quot;Almost in Love&quot;. There are several different takes that were made of the song in the session on March 7. The single version used take 16, which was also used for the soundtrack of the film. The version released on the &quot;Almost in Love&quot; album is take 10, which is 1 second longer in duration.

The musicians on the March 7 recording session included Hal Blaine, drums; Al Casey, guitar and Larry Knechtel, bass.

==1968 television special re-recording==
It was thought Presley re-recorded the song in June 1968 for the soundtrack of his 1968 comeback special, with the intent of performing it during the program (in part due to &quot;Live a Little, Love a Little&quot; being scheduled for release about a month before the special&#x27;s broadcast date). Ultimately, it was decided not to use this recording, and the song was dropped from the planned special. The newer version transposed the key of A major recording of three months earlier into E major and featured a vocal and heavy reverb with backup vocals from The Blossoms. In the mid-1990s, Joseph A. Tunzi sold this recording to Bertelsmann Music Group and it was initially included on the 1998 release &quot;&quot;. Tunzi had been the first to document this recording in his 1996 book &quot;Elvis Sessions II: The Recorded Music of Elvis Aron Presley 1953-1977&quot;.
After the tapes from the original session were rediscovered, it is now known to be take 2, recorded on March 7, 1968.

==Charts==
==Junkie XL / JXL remix==
Following the song&#x27;s use in the 2001 film &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot;, &quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot; was remixed by Dutch musician Tom Holkenborg, better known as Junkie XL (billed as JXL). The electronic remix featured Elvis with his baritone voice, and added emphasis to the 1968 guitars, horns, and a funk drum beat. Holkenborg is the first artist outside the Presley organization to receive authorization from the Presley estate to remix a Presley song. (in the 1980s, Elvis&#x27; longtime producer Felton Jarvis had overseen remixes of a number of Elvis recordings that saw new backing added to Presley&#x27;s original vocals, the first of which were released as the album &quot;Guitar Man&quot; in 1981). The electronic version of the song became a number-one hit in the UK in 2002. The song also became a top-10 hit in many other countries, reaching number one in 13 of them. 

In 2002, &quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot; as remixed by Junkie XL was used for Nike&#x27;s 2002 FIFA World Cup advertising campaign, titled &quot;Secret Tournament&quot;. A single, credited to &quot;Elvis vs. JXL&quot;, was issued and went on to become a number-one hit in over 20 countries.

At about the same time, a compilation of Presley&#x27;s US and UK number-one chart hits, titled &quot;ELV1S: 30 No. 1 Hits&quot;, was being prepared for release. At the last minute, &quot;A Little Less Conversation (Junkie&#x27;s remix version)&quot; was added as the album&#x27;s 31st and final track, just before its release in October 2002. The full 6:09 version was edited slightly and extended to 6:22, and this version was featured on the US version of Junkie XL&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;Radio JXL: A Broadcast from the Computer Hell Cabin&quot;.

===Chart performance===
In the United States, the song peaked at number 50 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It also spent four consecutive weeks at number-one on the UK Singles Chart, which is the only number-one hit by Elvis Presley to be released after his death in 1977. The song was re-released as a single in the United Kingdom in 2005, and reached No. 3.

<doc id="680110" wikidata="Q4862420" url="?curid=680110" title="Baron Grey de Wilton">
<text>Baron Grey de Wilton is a title that has been created twice, once in the Peerage of England (1295) and once in the Peerage of Great Britain (1784). The first creation was forfeit and the second creation is extinct.

==History==
===First creation===
The first creation was generally dated to 23 June 1295, when Reginald de Grey was summoned to an assembly prior to the Model Parliament that was summoned that November, as &quot;Lord Grey de Wilton&quot;. 
&quot;Burke&#x27;s Peerage&quot; notes that the June &quot;assembly in question is not now recognized as a bona fide Parl[iament]&quot;, but that Reginald had earlier been summoned to the &quot;assembly called a full Parl[iament] of 29 May 1290&quot;. 
This branch of the Grey family of aristocrats was based at Wilton Castle on the Welsh border in Herefordshire. The Greys of Wilton, as well as the other old noble families bearing the name of Grey/Gray, are descended from the Norman knight Anchetil de Greye. Wilton Castle itself passed from the family when the 13th baron was forced to sell it to raise his ransom after being captured in France. Sir Thomas Grey, the 15th baron, was attainted in 1603, forfeiting his titles and honours, after being convicted of treason for his alleged involvement in the Bye Plot against King James I. Grey never married. The attainder against him was not reversed prior to his death. His two sisters would have been his co-heiresses but for the attainder; one of them, Bridget, married Sir Roland Egerton, 1st Baronet, and they were ancestors of the recipient of the second creation below.

===Second creation===

The second creation was in 1784, when Sir Thomas Egerton (1749–1814) was created Baron Grey de Wilton, of Wilton Castle, with remainder to the heirs male of his body. He was a member of the Egerton family and had in 1756 succeeded to his father&#x27;s Grey Egerton baronetcy. The 1st baronet had married Bridget Grey, the sister of Sir Thomas Grey. In 1801, the 1st Baron Grey de Wilton was also made Viscount Grey de Wilton and Earl of Wilton, of Wilton Castle in the County of Hereford, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The latter titles were created with remainder to the second and younger sons successively of his daughter Eleanor, wife of Robert Grosvenor, 1st Marquess of Westminster.

On the first earl of Wilton&#x27;s death in 1804, the Grey de Wilton barony became extinct, as he had no sons, while the Grey Egerton baronetcy passed to a distant relative. The titles of &quot;Earl of Wilton&quot; and &quot;Viscount Grey de Wilton&quot; passed, according to the special remainder, to the 1st earl&#x27;s grandson, Thomas Grosvenor (1799–1882), who adopted the surname of Egerton and became the 2nd earl. These titles are still extant.

<doc id="680115" wikidata="Q1069061" url="?curid=680115" title="Chelation therapy">
<text>Chelation therapy is a medical procedure that involves the administration of chelating agents to remove heavy metals from the body. Chelation therapy has a long history of use in clinical toxicology and remains in use for some very specific medical treatments, although it is administered under very careful medical supervision due to various inherent risks, including the mobilization of mercury and other metals through the brain and other parts of the body by the use of weak chelating agents that unbind with metals before elimination, exacerbating existing damage. To avoid mobilization, some practitioners of chelation use strong chelators, such as selenium, taken at low doses over a long period of time.

Chelation therapy must be administered with care as it has a number of possible side effects, including death. In response to increasing use of chelation therapy as alternative medicine and in circumstances in which the therapy should not be used in conventional medicine, various health organizations have confirmed that medical evidence does not support the effectiveness of chelation therapy for any purpose other than the treatment of heavy metal poisoning. Over-the-counter chelation products are not approved for sale in the United States.

== Medical uses ==
Chelation therapy is the preferred medical treatment for metal poisoning, including acute mercury, iron (including in cases of sickle-cell disease and thalassemia), arsenic, lead, uranium, plutonium and other forms of toxic metal poisoning. The chelating agent may be administered intravenously, intramuscularly, or orally, depending on the agent and the type of poisoning.

===Chelating agents===

There are a variety of common chelating agents with differing affinities for different metals, physical characteristics, and biological mechanism of action. For the most common forms of heavy metal intoxication – lead, arsenic, or mercury – a number of chelating agents are available. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) has been recommended by poison control centers around the world for the treatment of lead poisoning in children. Other chelating agents, such as 2,3-dimercaptopropanesulfonic acid (DMPS) and alpha lipoic acid (ALA), are used in conventional and alternative medicine. Some common chelating agents are ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 2,3-dimercaptopropanesulfonic acid (DMPS), and thiamine tetrahydrofurfuryl disulfide (TTFD). Calcium-disodium EDTA and DMSA are only approved for the removal of lead by the Food and Drug Administration while DMPS and TTFD are not approved by the FDA. These drugs bind to heavy metals in the body and prevent them from binding to other agents. They are then excreted from the body. The chelating process also removes vital nutrients such as vitamins C and E, therefore these must be supplemented.

The German Environmental Agency (Umweltbundesamt) listed DMSA and DMPS as the two most useful and safe chelating agents available.

==Side effects==

When used properly in response to a diagnosis of harm from metal toxicity, side effects of chelation therapy include dehydration, low blood calcium, harm to kidneys, increased enzymes as would be detected in liver function tests, allergic reactions, and lowered levels of dietary elements. When administered inappropriately, there are the additional risks of hypocalcaemia (low calcium levels), neurodevelopmental disorders, and death.

== History ==

Chelation therapy can be traced back to the early 1930s, when Ferdinand Münz, a German chemist working for I.G. Farben, first synthesized ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Munz was looking for a replacement for citric acid as a water softener. Chelation therapy itself began during World War II when chemists at the University of Oxford searched for an antidote for lewisite, an arsenic-based chemical weapon. The chemists learned that EDTA was particularly effective in treating lead poisoning.

Following World War II, chelation therapy was used to treat workers who had painted United States naval vessels with lead-based paints. In the 1950s, Norman Clarke Sr. was treating workers at a battery factory for lead poisoning when he noticed that some of his patients had improved angina pectoris following chelation therapy. Clarke subsequently administered chelation therapy to patients with angina pectoris and other occlusive vascular disease and published his findings in &quot;The American Journal of the Medical Sciences&quot; in December 1956. He hypothesized that &quot;EDTA could dissolve disease-causing plaques in the coronary systems of human beings.&quot; In a series of 283 patients treated by Clarke et al. From 1956 to 1960, 87% showed improvement in their symptomatology. Other early medical investigators made similar observations of EDTA&#x27;s role in the treatment of cardiovascular disease (Bechtel, 1956; Bessman, 1957; Perry, 1961; Szekely, 1963; Wenig, 1958: and Wilder, 1962). However, later systemic reviews found that chelation was no better than placebo in treating heart disease.

In the 1960s, BAL was modified into DMSA, a related dithiol with far fewer side effects. DMSA quickly replaced both BAL and EDTA as the primary treatment for lead, arsenic and mercury poisoning in the United States. Esters of DMSA have been developed which are reportedly more effective; for example, the monoisoamyl ester (MiADMSA) is reportedly more effective than DMSA at clearing mercury and cadmium. Research in the former Soviet Union led to the introduction of DMPS, another dithiol, as a mercury-chelating agent. The Soviets also introduced ALA, which is transformed by the body into the dithiol dihydrolipoic acid, a mercury- and arsenic-chelating agent. DMPS has experimental status in the United States, while ALA is a common nutritional supplement.

Since the 1970s, iron chelation therapy has been used as an alternative to regular phlebotomy to treat excess iron stores in people with haemochromatosis. Other chelating agents have been discovered. They all function by making several chemical bonds with metal ions, thus rendering them much less chemically reactive. The resulting complex is water-soluble, allowing it to enter the bloodstream and be excreted harmlessly.

In 1973, a group of practicing physicians created the Academy of Medical Preventics, later renamed the American College for Advancement in Medicine (ACAM). The academy trains and certifies physicians in the safe administration of chelation therapy. Members of the academy continued to use EDTA therapy for the treatment of vascular disease and developed safer administration protocols. However, in 1998 the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) pursued the ACAM, an organization that promotes &quot;complementary, alternative and integrative medicine&quot; over the claims made regarding the treatment of atherosclerosis in advertisements for EDTA chelation therapy. The FTC concluded that there was a lack of scientific studies to support these claims and that the statements by the ACAM were false. In 1999, the ACAM agreed to stop presenting chelation therapy as effective in treating heart disease, avoiding legal proceedings. In 2010 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned companies who sold over-the-counter (OTC) chelation products and stated that such &quot;products are unapproved drugs and devices and that it is a violation of federal law to make unproven claims about these products. There are no FDA-approved OTC chelation products.&quot;

==Controversies==

In 1998, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) charged that the web site of the American College for Advancement in Medicine (ACAM) and a brochure they published had made false or unsubstantiated claims. In December 1998, the FTC announced that it had secured a consent agreement barring ACAM from making unsubstantiated advertising claims that chelation therapy is effective against atherosclerosis or any other disease of the circulatory system.

In August 2005, doctor error led to the death of a five-year-old boy with autism who was undergoing chelation therapy. Others, including a three-year-old non-autistic girl and a non-autistic adult, have died while undergoing chelation therapy. These deaths were due to cardiac arrest caused by hypocalcemia during chelation therapy. In two of the cases, hypocalcemia appears to have been caused by the administration of Na2EDTA (disodium EDTA) and in the third case the type of EDTA was unknown. Only the three-year-old girl had been found to have an elevated blood lead level and resulting low iron levels and anemia, which is the conventional medical cause for administration of chelation therapy.

According to protocol, EDTA should not be used in the treatment of children. More than 30 deaths have been recorded in association with IV-administered disodium EDTA since the 1970s.

===Use in alternative medicine===
In alternative medicine, some practitioners claim chelation therapy can treat a variety of ailments, including heart disease and autism. The use of chelation therapy by alternative medicine practitioners for behavioral and other disorders is considered pseudoscientific; there is no proof that it is effective. Chelation therapy prior to heavy metal testing can artificially raise urinary heavy metal concentrations (&quot;provoked&quot; urine testing) and lead to inappropriate and unnecessary treatment. The American College of Medical Toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology warn the public that chelating drugs used in chelation therapy may have serious side effects, including liver and kidney damage, blood pressure changes, allergies and in some cases even death of the patient.

====Cancer====
The American Cancer Society says of chelation therapy: &quot;Available scientific evidence does not support claims that it is effective for treating other conditions such as cancer. Chelation therapy can be toxic and has the potential to cause kidney damage, irregular heartbeat, and even death.&quot;

====Cardiovascular disease====
According to the findings of a 1997 systematic review, EDTA chelation therapy is not effective as a treatment for coronary artery disease and this use is not approved in the United States by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The American Heart Association stated in 1997 that there is &quot;no scientific evidence to demonstrate any benefit from this form of therapy.&quot; The FDA, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the American College of Cardiology &quot;all agree with the American Heart Association&quot; that &quot;there have been no adequate, controlled, published scientific studies using currently approved scientific methodology to support this therapy for cardiovascular disease.&quot; 

A systematic review published in 2005 found that controlled scientific studies did not support chelation therapy for heart disease. It found that very small trials and uncontrolled descriptive studies have reported benefits while larger controlled studies have found results no better than placebo.

In 2009, the Montana Board of Medical Examiners issued a position paper concluding that &quot;chelation therapy has no proven efficacy in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, and in some patients could be injurious.&quot;

The U.S. National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) conducted a trial on the chelation therapy&#x27;s safety and efficacy for patients with coronary artery disease. NCCAM Director Stephen E. Straus cited the &quot;widespread use of chelation therapy in lieu of established therapies, the lack of adequate prior research to verify its safety and effectiveness, and the overall impact of coronary artery disease&quot; as factors motivating the trial. The study has been criticized by some who said it was unethical, unnecessary and dangerous, and that multiple studies conducted prior to it demonstrated that the treatment provides no benefit.

The US National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine began the Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy (TACT) in 2003. Patient enrollment was to be completed around July 2009 with final completion around July 2010, but enrollment in the trial was voluntarily suspended by organizers in September 2008 after the Office for Human Research Protections began investigating complaints such as inadequate informed consent. Additionally, the trial was criticized for lacking prior Phase I and II studies, and critics summarized previous controlled trials as having &quot;found no evidence that chelation is superior to placebo for treatment of CAD or PVD.&quot; The same critics argued that methodological flaws and lack of prior probability made the trial &quot;unethical, dangerous, pointless, and wasteful.&quot; The American College of Cardiology supported the trial and research to explore whether chelation therapy was effective in treating heart disease. Evidence of insurance fraud and other felony convictions among (chelation proponent) investigators further undermined the credibility of the trial.

The final results of TACT were published in November 2012. The authors concluded that disodium EDTA chelation &quot;modestly&quot; reduced the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes among stable patients with a history of myocardial infarction. The study also showed a &quot;marked&quot; reduction in cardiovascular events in diabetic patients treated with EDTA chelation. An editorial published in the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; said that &quot;the study findings may provide novel hypotheses that merit further evaluation to help understand the pathophysiology of secondary prevention of vascular disease.&quot; Critics of the study characterized the study as showing no support for the use of chelation therapy in coronary heart disease, particularly the claims to reduce the need for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG, pronounced &quot;cabbage&quot;).

==== Autism ====
Quackwatch says that autism is one of the conditions for which chelation therapy has been falsely promoted as effective, and practitioners falsify diagnoses of metal poisoning to trick parents into having their children undergo the risky process. , up to 7% of children with autism worldwide had been subjected to chelation therapy. The death of two children in 2005 was caused by the administration of chelation treatments, according to the American Center for Disease Control. One of them had autism. Parents either have a doctor use a treatment for lead poisoning, or buy unregulated supplements, in particular DMSA and lipoic acid. Aspies For Freedom, an autism rights organization, considers this use of chelation therapy unethical and potentially dangerous. There is little to no credible scientific research that supports the use of chelation therapy for the effective treatment of autism.

<text>Sheikh Shakhbut bin Dhiyab Al Nahyan () was the Ruler of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi from 1793 to 1816, now part of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

==Political career==
Sheikh Shakhbut was the eldest son (or brother) of Sheikh Dhiyab bin Isa Al Nahyan who was the leader of the Bani Yas tribal confederation.

In 1761 Shakhbut&#x27;s father, Dhiyab bin Isa, sent a hunting party from Liwa which tracked a gazelle to a brackish spring on the island. According to legend, the gazelle became the symbol of Abu Dhabi, and gave it its name (literally &quot;Father of the Gazelle&quot;). In 1793, Dhiyab ordered Shakbut to move to the island; he did, and built a village and fort there near a freshwater spring. The fort, &quot;Qasr al-Hosn&quot;, became the palace of the sheikhs. It housed the Centre for Documentation and Research for several years, and is now a museum. By Shakhbut&#x27;s reign, Abu Dhabi had expanded to some 400 houses.

==Successors==
He was followed by his sons Mohammed bin Shakhbut (ruled 1816–1818), Tahnun bin Shakhbut (ruled 1818–1833), Khalifa bin Shakhbut Al Nahyan (ruled 1833–1845), but co-ruled throughout all their reigns. Hilal and Yafoor are identified as his sons in the 1845 &quot;Memoranda on the Tribes of the Arabian Shores of the Persian Gulf&quot; of Lieutenant AB Kembal, Assistant Resident at Bushire.

==Legacy==
He has been described as legendary, and having a notable amount of sons. He was deposed by his son.

<text>Pharology is the scientific study of lighthouses and signal lights, their construction and illumination. The variation &quot;pharonology&quot; is occasionally attested. Those who study or are enthused by lighthouses are known as pharologists.

== Origin of term ==
The term originally began as pharonology and is prevalent in many 1840s papers on the study of lighthouses. The term stems from the classical Latin or its ancient Greek etymon &quot;Pharos&quot;, meaning lighthouse (Pharos was also the proper name of the famed lighthouse of Alexandria) and the Greek root “logos&quot; (a word or discourse) in John Purdy&#x27;s &quot;The Colombian Navigator; Or, Sailing Directory for the American Coasts and the West-Indies&quot;. It was again used in Purdy&#x27;s &quot;The New Sailing Directory for the Strait of Gibraltar and the Western Division of the Mediterranean Sea: Comprehending the Coasts of Spain, France, and Italy, from Cape Trafalgar to Cape Spartivento, the Balearic Isles, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily and the Maltese Islands, with the African Coast, from Tangier to Tripoli, Inclusive ... Improved, by Considerable Additions, to the Present Times&quot;. The term&#x27;s usage was recognized in &quot;The Nautical Magazine: A Journal of Papers on Subjects Connected with Maritime Affairs, Volume 13&quot; as &quot;bestowing a passing notice... which has for some time cut a figure, sublime or ridiculous, in our books of sailing directions&quot;.

The term, pharology, first appeared in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Arts of London in 1847 and credited its coinage as &quot;being first introduced by the late Mr [John] Purdy&quot;. &quot;A description and list of the lighthouses of the world, 1861&quot; also makes the same claim noting that the term is used to describe the study of modern lighthouses from the 1800s. The term also comes from &quot;Pharos&quot;.

== As a study ==
In the 1860s the term&#x27;s usage was equated to lighthouse engineering including the structure and optical systems used in the lighthouses. More recently, pharology has re-appeared as an obscure or niche area of expertise that focuses on lighthouses and signal lights that surpasses hobby interests. Patrick Barkham of The Guardian noted the association with trainspotters, but Vikki Gilson of Trinity House noted that a wide spectrum of interest in lighthouses is shared by both young and old.

<doc id="680130" wikidata="Q334869" url="?curid=680130" title="Habibullah Khan">
<text>Habibullah Khan (Pashto/Persian: ; 3 June 1872 – 20 February 1919) was the Emir of Afghanistan from 1901 until his assassination in 1919 by Shuja-ud-Daula Ghourbandi. He was the eldest son of the Emir Abdur Rahman Khan, whom he succeeded by right of primogeniture in October 1901. His grandfather was Mohammad Afzal Khan.

== Early life ==
Habibullah was the eldest son of Emir Abdur Rahman, and was born in Samarkand, Uzbekistan to a Pashtun family in 1872. He had a younger brother, born on December 7, 1874, Nasrullah Khan.

== Reign ==

Habibullah was a relatively reform-minded ruler who attempted to modernize his country. During his reign he worked to bring modern medicine and other technology to Afghanistan. Many people who were forced into exile by his father were returned to Afghanistan by a general amnesty decreed by Habibullah. In 1901, Habibullah passed a law forcing Hindu men to wear yellow turbans and women to wear a yellow veil in public in order to distinguish them from Muslims and to discriminate against. In 1903, Habibullah founded the Habibia school as well as a military academy. He also worked to put in place progressive reforms in his country. He instituted various legal reforms and repealed many of the harshest criminal penalties. One of his chief advisers, Abdul Lateef was sentenced to death in 1903 for apostasy, being stoned to death in Kabul. Other reforms included the dismantling of the internal intelligence organization that had been put in place by his father. Qala-e-Seraj in Mihtarlam was built by the Habibullah c. 1912–13 to spend his winters.

=== Khost rebellion ===

In May 1912, Habibullah faced the only crisis in his career when a rebellion, known as the Khost rebellion, erupted in Khost led by Jehandad Khan, a rival claimant to the Afghan throne. This rebellion ended in August that same year, when the rebels were given concessions by the Afghan government.

=== World War I ===
Habibullah maintained the country&#x27;s neutrality in World War I, despite strenuous efforts by the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and a German military mission (Niedermayer–Hentig Expedition) to enlist Afghanistan on its side. He also greatly reduced tensions with British India, signing a treaty of friendship in 1905 and paying an official state visit in 1907. While in India, he was initiated into Freemasonry, at Lodge Concordia, No. 3102.

== Assassination ==
In the summer of 1918, an ultimatum was sent to Habibullah. The ultimatum demanded the formation of a constitutional government and was followed by a threat, which was disregarded. During prepared celebrations for his birthday, Habibullah was shot at while driving through the Shor Bazaar in Kabul. However, the bullet only hit the car he was driving in.
Habibullah requested Mustufi Husain Khan to find the assailants, and utilized this attempt to remove political dissenters and reformers against his government. Mustufi Husain identified numerous people, including associates of Mahmud Tarzi such as Abdul Rahman Ludin, and Abdul Hadi Dawai. Mustufi Husain also identified the Habibullah&#x27;s son, Amanullah Khan as being involved. This was, however, disregarded entirely. With the winter of 1918—1919 approaching, as well as a Spanish flu outbreak in Kabul, Habibullah retreated to his winter quarters in Jalalabad, leaving Amanullah Khan regent in Kabul as he left. In January 1919, Habibullah embarked on a hunt, and arrived in Kalagosh, an area in the province of Laghman. During the night of 19 February 1919, Military officer and close friend of Amanullah Khan, Shuja-ud-Daula Ghourbandi, managed to avoid Habibullah&#x27;s bodyguards, and shot him through the ear at very close range, killing him.

Habibullah&#x27;s brother Nasrullah Khan briefly succeeded him as Emir and held power for a week between 21 and 28 February 1919 before being ousted and imprisoned by Amanullah Khan, Habibullah&#x27;s third son. This occurred a few months before the Third Anglo-Afghan War.

<doc id="680133" wikidata="Q3150262" url="?curid=680133" title="Area codes 716 and 624">
<text>Area codes 716 and 624 are telephone area codes in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for Buffalo, Niagara Falls, and four surrounding counties in western New York. 716 was one of the original North American area codes established in 1947, while 624 was assigned to the identical numbering plan area (NPA) in 2023.

==History==
When the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) devised the first nationwide telephone numbering plan for Operator Toll Dialing in the 1940s, New York state was initially divided into five numbering plan areas, the most of any state, assigning a distinct area code to each. In 1947, area code 716 was assigned to an area with a significant portion of Central New York, as far east as Corning.

In 1954, the numbering plan area was reduced in size by merging its eastern portion with the southern portion of NPA 315, to create area code 607.

In 2001, the new area code 585 was created for Rochester and its suburbs. Until 1993, it was bounded at the Niagara River by area code 416 (now 905) in Ontario.

Prior to October 2021, area code 716 had telephone numbers assigned for the central office code 988. In 2020, &quot;988&quot; had been designated nationwide as a dialing code for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which created a conflict for exchanges that permit seven-digit dialing. This area code was therefore scheduled to transition to ten-digit dialing by October 24, 2021.

A 2022 analysis by the NANP Administrator determined that area code 716 will exhaust its central office prefixes in 2024. As a result, New York Public Service Commission approved area code 624, and was assigned to form an all-service overlay complex in the 716 area, with an in-service date of November 16, 2023.

==Service area==
The numbering plan area comprises the following counties:
* Erie County (includes city of Buffalo and surrounding suburbs)
* Cattaraugus County (includes city of Olean)
* Chautauqua County (includes cities of Jamestown and Dunkirk)
* Niagara County (includes Niagara Falls and Lockport)

Because of Olean&#x27;s proximity to the 716/585 line, some Olean exchanges use area code 585, particularly those in use for Sprint Corporation cell phones.

<doc id="680139" wikidata="Q7935884" url="?curid=680139" title="Viscount of Stormont">
<text>Viscount of Stormont is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1621 by James VI for his friend and helper Sir David Murray who had saved him from the attack of the Earl of Gowrie in 1600. Murray had already been created Lord Scone, also in the Peerage of Scotland in 1605. The peerages were created with remainder to 1) Sir Mungo Murray, fourth son of John Murray, 1st Earl of Tullibardine, failing which to 2) John Murray, who was created Earl of Annandale in 1625, and failing which to 3) Sir Andrew Murray, who was created Lord Balvaird in 1641. Lord Stormont died childless and was succeeded according to the special remainder by the aforementioned Mungo Murray, the second Viscount. He died without male issue and was succeeded according to the special remainder by James Murray, 2nd Earl of Annandale, who now also became the third Viscount Stormont. He was the son of the aforementioned John Murray, 1st Earl of Annandale. He was also childless and on his death in 1658 the earldom became extinct.

He was succeeded in the lordship of Scone and the viscountcy of Stormont according to the special remainder by David Murray, 2nd Lord Balvaird, who became the fourth Viscount Stormont (see the Lord Balvaird for earlier history of this title). He was the son of the aforementioned Andrew Murray, 1st Lord Balvaird. On his death the titles passed to his son, the fifth Viscount. His second son, James Murray was Member of Parliament for Dumfriesshire from 1711 to 1713, and later supported the Jacobite rising of 1715. In 1721 he was created Earl of Dunbar, Viscount of Drumcairn and Lord Halldykes in the Jacobite peerage. His third son was the prominent lawyer and judge William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield and Mansfield. In 1793 Lord Stormont&#x27;s grandson, the seventh Viscount, succeeded his uncle as second Earl of Mansfield according to a special remainder in the letters patent. For further history of the titles, see the Earl of Mansfield.

<doc id="680175" wikidata="Q212564" url="?curid=680175" title="Colombia national football team">
<text>The Colombia national football team (), nicknamed &quot;Los Cafeteros,&quot; represents Colombia in men&#x27;s international football and is managed by the Colombian Football Federation, the governing body for football in Colombia. They are a member of CONMEBOL and are currently ranked 10th in the FIFA World Rankings. The team are nicknamed &quot;Los Cafeteros&quot; due to the coffee production in their country. The national team has been a symbol of nationalism, pride and passion for many Colombians worldwide. Colombia is known for having a passionate fan base, and the team&#x27;s dances during goal celebrations have been symbolic.

The Colombian team has participated in six World Cups: 1962, 1990, 1994, 1998, 2014 and 2018. In the 2014 edition held in Brazil, the team achieved its best World Cup performance, reaching the quarter-finals and coming fifth in the final standings. 

Its greatest international achievement is winning the Copa América in 2001 as hosts, during which the team set a record by winning every match without conceding a single goal. Colombia also finished runner-up in 1975 and 2024 and finished third five times: in 1987, 1993, 1995, 2016, and 2021. 

Furthermore, the team managed to make outstanding appearances at the continental level, obtaining from the Central American and Caribbean Games the gold and bronze medals in 1946 and 1938 respectively, and in the Bolivarian Games the team obtained the gold medal in 1951 and the silver medal in 1961, 1973 and 1981.

==History==
===Early years, Argentine influence and maiden World Cup debut===
The development of football in Colombia is debated by many. Most historians agree that the Caribbean Region was the place where football spread. It is believed that its origins go back to 1900, by English railway engineers from The Colombia Railways Company. It was not until 1924 that the Colombian Football Federation was formed, initially under the name Liga de Fútbol, that gained the affiliation with FIFA and CONMEBOL in 1936. Colombia played its first international match on 17 February 1926 against Costa Rica at the Julio Torres Stadium in Barranquilla, obtaining a 4–1 victory against the Central Americans.
In 1937, Colombia formed a national team for the &quot;Juegos del IV Centenario de Cali&quot; (Games of the IV Centenary of Cali). Colombia played four matches at the recently opened Estadio Olímpico Pascual Guerrero: against Mexico (3–1), Argentina (1–3), Ecuador (5–0), and Cuba (1–3). Despite becoming a FIFA member in 1936, Colombia withdrew from the 1938 World Cup in France. Instead, Colombia played at the 1938 Central American and Caribbean Games. The Colombia national football team was composed mostly by all the players of the &quot;Club Juventud Bogotana&quot; (now Millonarios). Alfonso Novoa was the manager of Colombia until 23 February. The first game was played on 10 February 1938 against Mexico. Colombia was defeated 1–3; Luis Argüelles, Luis de la Fuente and Horacio Casarín scored for Mexico, while Marcos Mejía scored for Colombia. Colombia was able to obtain the bronze medal, with two wins and three losses. The same year, Colombia played at the I Bolivarian Games in Bogotá, where they finished fourth with one win and three losses. Fernando Paternoster was the manager of Colombia, the side&#x27;s first foreign manager.
Colombia did not play again until 1945 when they participated for the first time at the South American Championship, finishing in fifth place. This time, Colombia was composed by players of Junior de Barranquilla except for Antonio de la Hoz (who played for Sporting de Barranquilla) and Pedro Ricardo López (who played for Boca Juniors de Cali). Roberto Meléndez was player and coach of Colombia throughout the tournament. Despite Colombia&#x27;s debut at the tournament, the country withdrew from the 1946 edition. Instead, Colombia participated at the 1946 Central American and Caribbean Games in Barranquilla. There they won the gold medal-winning all six matches, scoring 20 goals and conceding 7 goals. The manager of Colombia during the year was the Peruvian José Arana Cruz. The following year, Colombia played at the 1947 South American Championship in Ecuador. The team was 8th, being the worst team of the tournament with just two draws obtained against Ecuador and Bolivia, and five defeats, scoring only 2 goals. The two goal scorers for Colombia at the tournament were Carlos Arango, who scored in Colombia&#x27;s 1–5 loss against Peru, and Rafael Granados who scored against Chile in Colombia&#x27;s last fixture which they lost 1–4. The manager, Argentine Lino Taioli, was sacked just after the tournament ended.
Colombia&#x27;s first match in the professional era was played on 6 April in the 1949 South American Championship, a 3–0 defeat against Paraguay. Austrian coach Friedrich Donenfeld was the manager of Colombia during the tournament; he had moved with his family to Colombia due to World War II, and Atlético Junior would be his first team as a coach. As Junior was chosen to represent Colombia in the tournament, he became in the first European manager of the Colombia national team. The team, however, repeated their losing streak since, as in the previous tournament, ended eighth with two draws and five losses, scoring four goals. Colombia chose to not enter the qualification process for the 1950 FIFA World Cup held in Brazil and also withdrew from the South American Championship in 1953. For the following World Cup in 1954, Colombia was banned from participating due to the controversial El Dorado era which witnessed the Colombia football league&#x27;s breaking away from FIFA. Colombia would also withdraw from the 1955 and 1956 editions of the South American Championship. For the 1957 South American Championship in Peru the manager was Pedro López, who was player of the national team between 1938 and 1945. Colombia was fifth, with two wins and four losses. In this tournament, Colombia suffered which is so far its biggest defeat, a 9–0 against Brazil. The most outstanding players of Colombia during the tournament players were the goalkeeper Efraín Sánchez and the forwards Carlos Arango and Delio Gamboa, both with three goals scored. After a withdrawal in 1938 and getting banned in 1954, Colombia participated for the first time in qualifying for the 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden with Rodolfo Orlandini as manager. Their first match was on 16 June 1957 against Uruguay in Bogotá, which ended in a 1–1 draw. Colombia lost their next matches, leaving them at the bottom of the group.

Under Argentine coach Adolfo Pedernera, Colombia qualified for the 1962 World Cup, its first-ever FIFA World Cup by eliminating Peru. The first match was played in Bogotá and ended 1–0 in favour of Colombia with a goal from Eusebio Escobar. For the following game in Lima, Peru managed to tie on aggregate with the help of a penalty in the third minute of the match, however, Héctor González scored in the 68th minute of the second half to help Colombia win 2–1 on aggregate.
At the 1962 World Cup, Colombia was drawn into a tough group containing Uruguay, Soviet Union and Yugoslavia; both had achieved notable results comparing to Colombia. Colombia lost its first match, 2–1 against Uruguay. Luis Cubilla and Jorge Sasía scored for Uruguay at the 56th and 75th minute respectively, while Francisco Zuluaga scored a 19th-minute penalty goal for Colombia to give the Colombians their first-ever World Cup goal and a shock lead. In the second match, they earned a 4–4 draw with the USSR, champions of the 1960 European Nations&#x27; Cup. In this game, Colombia scored four goals against Soviet goalkeeper Lev Yashin, widely considered the best goalkeeper in football history. Also in that game, América de Cali midfielder Marcos Coll scored the only olympic goal in World Cup history so far. Unfortunately, the Colombian campaign in 1962 ended with a 5–0 defeat against Yugoslavia, who finished in fourth place in the tournament. After the 1962 World Cup, Colombia didn&#x27;t qualify for 28 years before they returned in the 1990 edition.

===First Copa América final and unsuccessful World Cup qualification campaigns (1963–1979)===
After withdrawing the two editions of the South American Championship in Argentina and Ecuador, Colombia participated in the 1963 South American Championship in Bolivia. Colombia finished last in the tournament with a draw and five defeats. Delio Gamboa scored three goals for Colombia. For the 1966 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, Colombia was placed in a group against Ecuador and Chile. The team finished in the bottom of their group with two points, only a 2–0 win over Chile in Bogotá. The following year, Colombia had to play qualifying for the 1967 South American Championship against Chile, but was eliminated with a 5–2 defeat in Santiago and a 0–0 draw in Bogotá.

Colombia participated for qualifying for the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Group 2, with Brazil, Paraguay and Venezuela. The team finished third with one win, one draw and four defeats. In 1970, before the start of the World Cup in Mexico, England prepared a friendly against Colombia to prepare the team for the high altitudes of Mexico. England beat Colombia 4–0, but their victory was overshadowed by the Bogotá Bracelet incident. For the 1974 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, Colombia faced Uruguay and Ecuador. Colombia was able to obtain a win and three draws, tied on 5 points with Uruguay, but Uruguay would be the one who qualified to the next stage due to better goal difference.

At the 1975 Copa America, the team was under the orders of former Colombia national team player Efraín Sánchez. Colombia was placed in Group C with Paraguay and Ecuador. Colombia won all four games with seven goals scored and one conceded, advancing to the semifinals against Uruguay. Colombia won 3–0 at home and lost 1–0 away, but the 3–1 aggregate score allowed them to advance to the final for the first time in their history, where they faced Peru. Colombia won at home 1–0, but lost 2–0 away, so that the champion was defined on neutral ground (in Caracas) where Peru beat Colombia with a 25th-minute goal from Hugo Sotil. Colombian Ernesto Díaz tied Argentinian Leopoldo Luque as the top goalscorer of the tournament with 4 goals.

Yugoslav Blagoje Vidinić, who notably won the 1974 African Cup of Nations with Zaire (now known as DR Congo), was Colombia&#x27;s coach during the qualification process for the 1978 FIFA World Cup in Argentina. Colombia shared Group 1 with Brazil and Paraguay and failed to qualify after finishing last with just two points. Eduardo Vilarete was Colombia&#x27;s sole goalscorer throughout the qualifiers with a goal against Paraguay. Although failing to qualify for the World Cup, Vidinić continued as coach as Colombia disputed the 1979 Copa América, where they shared Group A with Chile and Venezuela. Despite finishing with the same points as first-placed Chile, Colombia were knocked out of the tournament due to goal difference.

===1980s: dawn of the Golden Generation and World Cup qualification===
Prior to the 1980s, the Colombia national football team was widely recognized as a weak team, and lack of fans, due to neglected investment for the national team by the Colombian Football Federation, national tragedies like &quot;La Violencia&quot;, and widespread criminal activities that destabilized the country. Their lack of participation also added to this sporadic support, and despite having qualified for the 1962 FIFA World Cup, the national team remained underachieving, particularly when compared to Chile, Peru, Bolivia and Paraguay who were not as worthy perennial challengers as traditional powers Uruguay, Brazil and Argentina, either, in spite of their youth football successes.

During the 1982 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, Colombia was under the command of Argentine manager Carlos Bilardo, who later won the World Cup with Argentina in 1986. Colombia was drawn into Group 2 with Peru and Uruguay with the first-placed team earning direct qualification. Colombia started off their qualification campaign with a 1–1 draw at home against Peru. Colombia played away against Uruguay for the second match, where they suffered a 3–2 defeat. For their next match, Colombia&#x27;s hopes of qualifying were diminished after suffering a 2–0 away defeat to Peru. Lastly, Colombia ended the qualification campaign with a 1–1 draw at home against Uruguay. Ultimately, Colombia finished last behind Uruguay and first-placed Peru with just 2 points. As a result, Bilardo was fired from his position as coach, eventually being replaced by Efraín Sánchez.

Former national team player Efraín Sánchez coached Colombia during the 1983 Copa América. The team played in Group C with Peru and Bolivia and started the tournament with a 1–0 win against Bolivia with a goal from forward Alex Valderrama, also known as &quot;Didi&quot;. Colombia would tie the following two games against Peru and Bolivia, respectively, thus failing to qualify to the next round after finishing second behind Peru with two less points. Didi was Colombia&#x27;s top scorer at the tournament, scoring in both of Colombia&#x27;s matches against Bolivia. Under the orders of Gabriel Ochoa Uribe, Colombia was drawn into Group 1 for the 1986 FIFA World Cup qualifiers along with Argentina, Peru, and Venezuela. The team began their qualification campaign with a 1–0 win against Peru with a goal from Miguel Prince. However, Colombia suffered a 1–3 home defeat to Argentina for the following fixture. Despite tying with Peru in the third fixture, Colombia fell 1–0 away to Argentina. Notably, Colombia recovered with a 2–2 tie and a 2–0 win against Venezuela. Colombia ultimately qualified for the play-offs against Paraguay, however, the team failed to qualify after losing 2–4 on aggregate.

In anticipation for the 1987 Copa América, Francisco Maturana was hired as Colombia&#x27;s coach. Placed in Group C with Bolivia and Paraguay, Colombia began their tournament with a 2–0 over Bolivia. Their next game against Paraguay ended 3–0 for Colombia, owing to a hat-trick from Arnoldo Iguarán. Colombia faced Chile in the semi-finals, a match which extended itself in extra-time following a 0–0 draw after regular time. Colombia would score in the 103rd minute following a penalty-kick goal from Bernardo Redín. However, Chile would ultimately score two goals to eliminate Colombia. Despite this, they won the third-place match against 1986 World Cup winners Argentina to finish in the top three for the first time in their history. Additionally, Iguarán won the tournament&#x27;s top-scorer award with four goals and Carlos Valderrama won the best player award for his nifty performances throughout the tournament.

For the 1990 World Cup qualifiers, South America was allocated three-and-a-half berths at the 1990 finals. The continent&#x27;s nine remaining sides were split into three groups with the two automatic qualifying berths going to the two best group winners, in this instance Uruguay and Brazil. The group winner with the worst record would advance to the CONMEBOL–OFC play-off. Thus, Colombia had to take on the winners of the Oceania zone. This turned out to be Israel, after they finished ahead of Australia and New Zealand in the final qualifying group. Colombia qualified for their first FIFA World Cup since 1962 after winning in Barranquilla 1–0, and tying in Ramat Gan 0–0, with most of the players coming from Atlético Nacional, who Maturana was also managing at the time.

===1990s: World Cup return, and the first Colombian Golden Era===

At the 1990 World Cup, Colombia was once again drawn with the Yugoslavs, alongside United Arab Emirates and powerhouse West Germany. Colombia faced the United Arab Emirates at the Stadio Renato Dall&#x27;Ara in Bologna, where they won 2–0 with goals from Bernardo Redín and Carlos Valderrama to achieve Colombia&#x27;s first-ever win at the World Cup finals. Although losing their second game against Yugoslavia 1–0, Colombia achieved qualification to the round of 16 after a historic 1–1 draw with eventual champions West Germany, where Freddy Rincón equalized the game for Colombia in the 93rd minute succeeding West Germany&#x27;s initial goal in the 88th minute from Pierre Littbarski. Thus, Colombia finished the group-stage in third place with 3 points which managed to place them second amongst the third-placed teams. However, Colombia would be eliminated in their next match against Cameroon with a 2–1 defeat in extra time, a match which is remembered for a mistake from Colombian goalkeeper René Higuita and Cameroonian star Roger Milla&#x27;s iconic goal celebration which was a product of Higuita&#x27;s mistake. Bernardo Redín led Colombia in goals scored with two goals against United Arab Emirates and Cameroon. Shortly after this defeat, Maturana left his post as Colombia manager. However, this World Cup appearance marked the rise of a generation known as the first Colombian golden generation.

For the 1991 Copa América, coach Luis Augusto García took charge of the Colombian national team. The squad included a consistent foundation of players which included stars such as Andrés Escobar, Luis Carlos Perea, Leonel Álvarez, Freddy Rincón, René Higuita, and captain Carlos Valderrama, amongst others. The team was drawn into Group B, composed of Ecuador, Bolivia, Brazil, and Uruguay. The team started off with a 1–0 win against Ecuador with a goal from Antony de Ávila. The following game, Colombia drew against Bolivia. Notably, the team triumphed over Brazil in a 2–0 win with goals from de Ávila and Iguarán, respectively. Despite losing their last game against Uruguay, Colombia topped the group with five points with a superior goal difference to Brazil and Uruguay, who shared the same amount of points. Despite an impressive run in the first round, Colombia ended last in the group for the final round after drawing once and losing twice. For this reason, Colombia finished fourth with de Ávila finishing as the team&#x27;s top scorer at the tournament with three goals; Argentina were ultimately crowned as champions.

Shortly before the 1993 Copa América in Ecuador, Maturana returned for his second spell as Colombia manager; Colombia&#x27;s captain during the tournament was Carlos Valderrama. Colombia began their tournament campaign by topping their group undefeated. In the first match, the team beat Mexico 2–1 with goals from Adolfo Valencia and Víctor Aristizábal. Colombia drew their next two games against Bolivia and Argentina. Despite sharing the same points as Argentina, Colombia finished first due to superior goal difference. In the quarter-finals, they beat Uruguay on penalties, and lost to eventual winners Argentina in the semi-finals on penalties, but won the third place match against Ecuador to finish third for the second time in their history. Freddy Rincón finished as Colombia&#x27;s top scorer with two goals against Argentina in the first round and against Ecuador in the third-place match.
Along with achieving qualification to the 1994 World Cup, Colombia finished top of their qualifying group without having lost a match, which included a historic 0–5 victory over Argentina in Buenos Aires. Curiously, a few days before the crucial match, Diego Maradona launched a phrase during a television interview: while putting palms of the hands parallel to the ground at chest height, one above the other, said &quot;You can&#x27;t change history, history shouldn&#x27;t be changed: Argentina up, Colombia down.&quot; 

Expectations of the team were high, some even naming them as favorites to win the tournament, as they had only lost one official match over a two-year period from July 1992 going into the World Cup. Colombia was drawn in Group A with the hosts United States, Romania, and Switzerland. During the tournament, the internal conflict within Colombia proved to be detrimental and harmful for the Colombian squad as the team was distracted from their main goal. Colombia only earned one win over Switzerland and suffered two losses, which would eliminate them in the group stage. The first match against Romania ended with a 3–1 defeat which notoriously angered Colombian drug cartels who had previously bet money on Colombia to win the match, which resulted in various death threats made to relatives of the Colombian players and manager Maturana. During the match against the United States, Andrés Escobar scored an own goal, leading to Colombia&#x27;s elimination as they lost 2–1. Escobar was later murdered in Colombia a few days after the own goal, and this incident would lead to the demise of Colombia&#x27;s first golden generation.

Hernán Darío Gómez was in charge of the national squad for the Copa América that followed in Uruguay in 1995. As with the last tournament, Carlos Valderrama was appointed as captain for his country. In the opening match, Colombia drew 1–1 against Peru with goals from Faustino Asprilla and Peruvian Roberto Palacios. Colombia won their following match against Ecuador with Rincón providing the sole goal. However, the team lost 3–0 against Brazil in the closing game. Despite the loss, Colombia qualified for the quarter-finals after finishing second behind Brazil. The team beat Paraguay in the quarter-finals in a penalty shoot-out which ended 5–4 after a 1–1 draw; Colombia eventually fell against Uruguay in the semi-finals. Conclusively, the team achieved a third-place finish after beating the United States 4–1 for the third-place match.

Colombia were placed with in Group C with Brazil, Mexico, and Costa Rica for 1997 Copa América in Bolivia on the direction of coach Maturana. The squad lost against Mexico 1–2 to start the competition. In the subsequent game against Costa Rica, which Colombia won 4–1, they improved. Colombia qualified with a third-place finish despite losing their most recent game against Brazil. However, they were defeated by the host Bolivia in the quarterfinals, which brought their tournament to an end. Néider Morantes led Colombia in scoring during the competition with two goals against Costa Rica.

Under the command of Hernán Darío Gómez, Colombia ended with 28 points at the end of the qualifying round for the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France. Colombia finished in third position, two points behind Argentina, who had 30 points. Group G was given to Colombia, Tunisia, England, and once more, Romania. Similar to the 1994 version, Romania won the opening game 1–0 with a goal from Valencia forward Adrian Ilie. Furthermore, Léider Preciado&#x27;s goal in the 82nd minute gave Colombia a 1–0 victory over Tunisia in the team&#x27;s second game. In order to advance to the next round, Colombia needed to win their last game against England, however, &quot;The Three Lions&quot; defeated Colombia 2–0 with goals from midfielder Darren Anderton and a young David Beckham who scored his first goal for England from a free kick, thus ending Colombia&#x27;s tournament hopes. Ultimately, Colombia finished third in their group behind Romania and England, thus concluding their last World Cup appearance until the 2014 edition.

Coach Javier lvarez Arteaga oversaw Colombia&#x27;s participation at the 1999 Copa América in Paraguay. The team was placed in a challenging group with Argentina, Uruguay, and Ecuador. Víctor Bonilla&#x27;s lone goal gave his squad a 1–0 victory over Uruguay to kick off the competition. Colombia defeated Argentina 3–0 in their subsequent encounter thanks to goals from Iván Córdoba, Edwin Congo, and Johnnier Montaño. Argentine player Martin Palermo&#x27;s performance in the game, in which he notoriously missed three consecutive penalties, also left a lasting impression. For the last group-stage match against Ecuador, Néider Morantes and Middlesbrough F.C. forward Hámilton Ricard provided Colombia with two goals to beat Ecuador 2–1. The squad finished first in their group after winning all of their games. However, the team&#x27;s tournament fell short after a 3–2 loss against Chile in the quarter-finals. This time, Colombia&#x27;s top scorer at the tournament was Víctor Bonilla with two goals against Chile and Uruguay, respectively.

===2000s: First Copa América title and temporary decline===
Prior to the Copa América to be hosted in Colombia in 2001, the national team was invited to participate in their first 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup hosted in the United States, with the team under the orders of manager Luis Augusto García, also known in Colombia as &quot;El Chiqui&quot;. Furthermore, Colombia were put into Group A alongside Jamaica and Honduras. Colombia began their tournament against Jamaica, achieving a 1–0 win against the &quot;Reggae Boyz&quot; with a goal from Gonzalo Martínez. Against Honduras, the team lost 2–0, however, Colombia still managed to qualify to the next round thanks to Honduras having beat Jamaica two days before. For the quarter-finals, Colombia squared up against Group B winner and host United States, who had won both of previous their games against Haiti and Peru, respectively. During the game, the United States would score first with a 20th-minute goal from Brian McBride, but Colombia quickly tied four minutes later owing to Faustino Asprilla, thus concluding the first half. The United States would start off the second-half with an early goal from Chris Armas, and when things looked to be in favour for the U.S., Gerardo Bedoya tied the game with nine minutes to spare. Following a draw in extra-time, Colombia eliminated the United States on penalties 2–1, after goalkeeper Miguel Calero denied Ben Olsen&#x27;s crucial penalty kick. For the semi-finals, the team beat Peru 2–1 and would match up against Canada in the final, however, Colombia failed to lift the trophy after losing 2–0 with goals from Jason de Vos and Carlo Corazzin.

Manager Fransico Maturna returned to the national team for the 2001 Copa América, which was the first Copa América held in Colombia. Prior to the tournament, meetings were held by CONMEBOL authorities who were concerned about potential security issues in Colombia, and the tournament was canceled on 1 July, just ten days before the opening match. On 6 July, CONMEBOL decided to reinstate the tournament, which was held on schedule. Canada had already disbanded its training camp and released its players, so Costa Rica (a CONCACAF invitee) was invited to the tournament. The Argentine Football Association (AFA) decided to withdraw from the competition on July 10 despite Colombian authorities&#x27; proposal to take additional safety precautions. Supposedly, AFA had complained about the abrupt change and claimed that Argentine players had received death threats from terrorist groups. CONCACAF affiliated Honduras were invited, and they arrived on July 13 aboard an aeroplane provided by the Colombian Air Force, after the tournament had already begun and just a few hours before its opening match, with hardly enough players.

For the group stage, Colombia shared Group A with Chile, Ecuador, and Venezuela. On 11 July, Colombia began the tournament with a 2–0 victory against Venezuela in at the Estadio Metropolitano of Barranquilla, a location that would serve as Colombia&#x27;s home field throughout the group stage; Freddy Grisales and Víctor Aristizábal were the goal scorers for the home side. The following match against Ecuador ended in a 1–0 victory for Colombia, with Aristizábal providing the crucial goal. For their last fixture, Colombia defeated Chile 2–0 with goals from Aristizábal, and Eudalio Arriaga. Thus, Colombia topped their group with a perfect win-rate with a plus five difference and no goals conceded. They eliminated Peru in the quarter-finals with a brace from Aristizábal and an additional goal from Giovanni Hernández. For the semi-finals, Colombia faced the dark-horses of the tournament, Honduras, where Colombia prevailed 2–0 thanks to goals from Bedoya and another goal from Aristizábal, which marked his sixth and final goal of the tournament. Colombia won their first Copa América title by defeating Mexico, another CONCACAF invitee, in the final with a goal from captain Iván Córdoba in the second half. The team also broke a Copa America record of not conceding any goals and winning every game. Additionally, Aristizábal finished as the tournament&#x27;s top scorer, with six goals, and the team won the fair play award as well. Consequently, the title qualified the team for the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup in France. There were no terrorist incidents throughout the competition.

For the 2002 World Cup, Colombia only managed to place sixth in the qualification round, tied with Uruguay but failing to qualify due to goal difference. This was the first time that Colombia had failed to qualify for a World Cup since 1986. As a result, Maturana left his post as Colombia manager which still remains as his last stint with Colombia. Despite failure, the team did end up playing an international FIFA tournament the following year as representatives of CONMEBOL at the Confederations Cup. Colombia hired manager Reinaldo Rueda to overlook the team&#x27;s participation. The team was put into Group A alongside Euro 2000 champions and hosts France, 2000 AFC Asian Cup champions Japan, and winners of the 2002 OFC Nations Cup, New Zealand. In their opening game against France, Colombia lost 1–0 following a sole goal product of a penalty scored by Thierry Henry. Colombia obtained a crucial victory against New Zealand, match in which Colombia was trailing 0–1 at half-time, but came back to win 3–1 in the second half. In Colombia&#x27;s final Group A fixture, they beat Japan 1–0 with a 68th-minute goal from Giovanni Hernández, who had scored Colombia&#x27;s final goal in their previous fixture against New Zealand. Subsequently, the team finished the group stage second behind France and qualified for the semi-finals, where they lost 1–0 against Cameroon. The team would end up disputing the third-place play-off against Turkey, where they lost 1–2; Hernández scored Colombia&#x27;s only goal. Overall, Colombia placed fourth at the tournament with Hernández leading Colombia in goals scored with three goals, one shy from the eventual Golden Boot winner and champion with France, Thierry Henry.

Although the Colombian Golden Generation was exhibiting its declining years for the Colombian squad, the country had an acceptable performance at the 2004 Copa América under Reinaldo Rueda, beginning by topping their group. The team eliminated Costa Rica in the quarter-finals and then lost to Argentina in the semi-finals. They ended up earning fourth place after losing the third place match. Colombia also participated in the 2005 Gold Cup. The team performed poorly in the group stage, placing third with one win, and two losses. Even though it qualified to the next round as the best third-placed team and beat defending champions Mexico in the quarter-finals, the team was eventually eliminated by Panama, who Colombia had already lost to in the group stage. Prior to the tournament, expectations were high for Colombia, with the team considered as tournament favourites, which also marked a false reality after not making the final.

For the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, Reinaldo Rueda would continue as manager. Colombia was ultimately unsuccessful in their campaign, missing out by a single point due to Uruguay&#x27;s win over Argentina for the final fixture. Had Uruguay and Argentina drawn, Colombia would have qualified to the playoff spot with their 1–0 away win over Paraguay, and they had superior goal difference to Uruguay as well. 

During this period the likes of Juan Pablo Ángel and Tressor Moreno led the line.

Consequently, Rueda left the national team on 12 October, and was eventually replaced by Jorge Luis Pinto on 1 January 2007. The following year, Colombia had one of its worst ever Copa América performances. The team finished third in the group with just one win against the United States and two losses, including a 5–0 loss to Paraguay, which wasn&#x27;t enough to qualify for the knockout stages. Colombia ended the decade with an unsuccessful 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign, where the team experienced a similar situation to their previous qualification campaign and failed to qualify by a point despite winning their final match against Paraguay. Thus, Colombia had failed to qualify for the World Cup for the third time a row. These failures to qualify for the World Cup were mainly a result of constantly changing formations and a dysfunctional rotation of managers which saw Pinto replaced by Eduardo Lara after a 4–0 loss to Chile in September 2008, combined with the struggle to score goals in the last games of the qualification.

=== The Pékerman Era: revival and a new Golden Generation (2011–2018) ===
In June 2011, Colombia were ranked 54th, its lowest ever. Despite this ranking, in the 2011 Copa América, Colombia made a good run, topping their group and achieving a draw to the host nation Argentina. In the next round, Colombia would be eliminated in a 2–0 loss against Peru in extra time. &quot;Los Cafeteros&quot; ended 2011 at 36th in the FIFA rankings.

In September 2011, the Colombian side gained Leonel Álvarez as the new coach following the resignation of Hernán Darío Gómez, but he was sacked after three games with disappointing results, which led to the hiring of José Pékerman in January 2012. Pékerman&#x27;s first match was a 2–0 win over Mexico in Miami, and his first official match was a 1–0 victory against Peru in June. In October 2012, Colombia moved back into the top 10 of the FIFA Rankings for the first time since July 2002, after the wins against Chile (3–1) and Uruguay (4–0). The team climbed to 9th place, up 13 places. At the end of the year, the team were in 5th.

Under Pékerman, the squad would break a personal qualifying best record by finishing in second with 30 points, and raise their FIFA ranking consistently into the top ten, which allowed them to qualify for the World Cup for the first time in 16 years. The qualification was secured with a 3–3 draw against Chile, after having trailed 0–3 at the half. Although World Cup qualification was already secured, Colombia ended their qualifying campaign with a 2–1 victory against Paraguay in Asunción, with two goals from captain and defender Mario Yepes. Celebrations broke throughout the nation, as many neutrals hailed Colombia as a dark-horse towards being a World Cup contender. Often, Colombia were noted by many Colombian figures such as Carlos Valderrama as a team that could become the most successful Colombian squad in history. Throughout the qualification process, Colombia only conceded 12 goals, which was the second-best defensive record behind Argentina.

Even though the team&#x27;s record goalscorer Radamel Falcao missed the tournament through injury, Colombia topped off their return in the 2014 World Cup after a 16-year absence by defeating Greece 3–0. Colombia then edged a 2–1 victory over the Ivory Coast to dispute Group C&#x27;s top spot days later. On the same day, Japan and Greece drew 0–0 and automatically qualified Colombia to the round of 16 for the first time in 24 years since the 1990 World Cup. In its final group stage game, Colombia defeated Japan 4–1 to win Group C and become the third South American team (following Brazil and Argentina) to win all three group stage games in World Cup history. The Japan match also saw goalkeeper Faryd Mondragón, the last active player from the country&#x27;s previous World Cup appearance in 1998, become the oldest player ever to appear in a World Cup. Colombia went on to defeat Uruguay 2–0 on 28 June in the round of 16, securing a spot in the quarter-finals for the first time in their history. They then fell to hosts Brazil 2–1 in the quarter-finals. Despite the elimination, the national team was greeted by tens of thousands of Colombians in Bogotá, welcoming them back as heroes and restoring pride to the nation. Colombia would then receive the FIFA Fair Play Trophy and have James Rodríguez and Juan Cuadrado end as the World Cup&#x27;s leading goal scorer and assist leader, respectively.

Colombia had a disappointing 2015 Copa América, having won only a single game during the group stage match against Brazil, with their only goal of the tournament. Colombia would be eliminated by Argentina in the next round via a penalty shootout, ending their campaign with one win, two draws, and one loss. The following year, Colombia began their 2016 Copa América Centenario campaign with a 2–0 victory against hosts United States. They then sealed their qualification to the quarter-finals with a 2–1 victory against Paraguay, but finished their group campaign with a defeat to Costa Rica. On 17 June, they advanced to the semi-finals with a win against Peru on penalties. Colombia would then lose to eventual tournament winners Chile before winning the third place match against the hosts United States to seal their best result since winning the 2001 edition.
Colombia qualified for the 2018 FIFA World Cup by finishing fourth in CONMEBOL. The team began their campaign with a 2–1 defeat to Japan. Colombia resurrected their hopes of advancing from the group with a 3–0 win over Poland. On 28 June, Colombia beat Senegal by a scoreline of 1–0, topping their group and advancing into the round of 16. On 3 July in Moscow, Colombia were knocked out by England in the round of 16; the game finished 1–1 after extra time, with England winning 4–3 on penalties.

=== 2022 World Cup Qualification and Managerial Changes (2019–2022) ===
Following the federation&#x27;s choice to not renew Pekerman&#x27;s contract, former Iran manager Carlos Queiroz was hired to coach the national team. 

Starting off their 2019 Copa América campaign, Colombia defeated Argentina in a 2–0 win, marking their first victory over the &quot;La Albiceleste&quot; since 2007. Days later, they would face Asian Cup champions Qatar, and would beat them 1–0 to advance to the next round before finishing the group with a 1–0 victory over Paraguay, finishing with nine points with four goals scored and none conceded throughout the group stage. Colombia also became the only team since the 2001 edition to advance out of the group stage with a 100% record. Despite this, Colombia were then eliminated by Chile in a penalty shootout in the quarter-finals.

Colombia began the 2022 World Cup qualifiers with wins against Venezuela and Chile. However, when matches resumed following the COVID-19 pandemic, Colombia&#x27;s performances declined; notably with their worst home loss in 82 years against Uruguay and a 6–1 defeat by Ecuador. This led to the end of Carlos Queiroz&#x27;s tenure as Colombia&#x27;s coach in December 2020. On 14 January 2021, the Colombian Football Federation announced Reinaldo Rueda&#x27;s return to the national team. 

In the 2021 Copa América, Colombia won their opening match against Ecuador, before playing out a goalless draw with Venezuela. In their third match gainst Peru, Colombia lost 2–1. Next, Colombia lost to Brazil, leaving them in third position but meant they had qualified for the quarter-finals. They progressed to the semi-finals after a penalty shootout victory against Uruguay following a goalless draw. In the semi-finals, Colombia contested with Argentina, where they drew 1–1 before losing on penalties. Colombia managed to win the match for third place against Peru, with the score 3–2, where the last two goals that Luis Díaz scored along with one in the final 93rd minute of the game made him the top scorer of the Copa América, along with Lionel Messi. The third-place victory for Colombia marks their best result since also winning third place in the Copa América Centenario.

After the Copa América, Colombia resumed their 2022 qualification campaign. During qualification, Colombia went seven matches without scoring, harming their chances of qualifying. They defeated Venezuela 1–0, but results elsewhere left Colombia in sixth position, missing out on the World Cup finals. Rueda left his post as the Colombian team manager shortly after.

=== Néstor Lorenzo era (2022–present) ===

The Colombian Football Federation announced on 2 June 2022, that it had picked Néstor Lorenzo to replace Rueda as coach of the men&#x27;s national team for the next four years. On 28 February 2023, the federation launched an innovative project called &quot;Futbol con Futuro&quot; (Football with a Future) with the support of FIFA. The plan covers the 2022-25 period and aims to innovate as well as reinforce the modus operandi of all the country&#x27;s national teams so they can achieve success. &quot;To achieve results on the pitch and enable Colombia to win trophies,&quot; said Colombian Football Association (FCF) Development Director Ivan Novella, setting out the ambitious objectives of Futbol con Futuro.

Up until the Copa America final loss in extra time to Argentina on 14 July 2024, Colombia had gone 28 games undefeated under Lorenzo, which included wins over Germany, Brazil and Spain.

==Rivalries==
===Venezuela===
Colombia&#x27;s main geopolitical rival has always been Venezuela. However, the rivalry is historically very one-sided for Colombia. This state of affairs started to change from the late 1990s, when football slowly began replacing baseball as Venezuela&#x27;s main sport.

In 2001, Coach Luis Garcia was sacked for only managing a draw in an away game in San Cristóbal which ended 2–2 when a victory had been taken for granted. This was just a sign of things to come. Four years later in the 2006 World Cup qualifiers, Venezuela stunned the continent by defeating Colombia in Barranquilla 0–1. The game showed the new direction of the rivalry: while Colombia remains ahead on all rankings and competitions, Venezuela always outperform themselves when meeting each other. Former captain Valderrama started calling the games a &quot;classic&quot; and stated &quot;Venezuela kill themselves &quot;[do their best]&quot; playing against us.&quot;

During Jose Pekerman&#x27;s coaching for the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification, considered the rebirth of Colombian football, Venezuela still managed to win their game at home, which was one of only three defeats the Argentinean suffered. Venezuela also won the group stage game against Colombia in the 2015 Copa America which were their only three points, although Colombia still managed to advance to the knockout stage while Venezuela ended last. Colombia would finally win in Ciudad Guayana during 2022 World Cup qualifying which marked their first win in Venezuela since 1996. However, for a large segment of the population, the matches are still not as popular as the rival matches against Argentina.

===Argentina===

The historical Colombian 5–0 victory in 1993, beating host Argentina in the 1994 World Cup qualifiers, was the first time Argentina lost in its home stadium Estadio Monumental during a qualifying match for a World Cup. Argentina had come to the qualifiers as a World Cup champion and finalist in the most recent editions (1986 and 1990). It caused a huge upset and start of a respective rivalry. Unlike other rivalries full of hostility, the Colombian–Argentine rivalry is more based on &quot;respect&quot; than a &quot;hated&quot; relationship, always attracting great interest between both nations. 

In the group stages of Copa America 1999, another notable match occurred when Colombia won 3-0 with Argentina&#x27;s star striker Martin Palermo missing three penalty kicks. After the wane of Valderrama&#x27;s generation, the rivalry became one-sided again until recent years, when the majority of the games started resulting in draws.

Colombia and Argentina faced each other in ten matches during the past years, with Colombia winning once and Argentina twice, and 7 matches ending in draws. Tensions flourished again in 2021 after the semi-final match of the 2021 Copa America, a match which ended in a defeat for Colombia after the penalty shootout when Emiliano Martínez, the Argentinean goalkeeper, utilized provocative gestures and phrases to distract the Colombian players, which were broadcast on live television. The episode sparked much annoyance and anger from Colombia and Colombian supporters while it was praised from the Argentinian side, adding up to the already heated relationship of the teams.

Most recently in 2024, the two nations met in the final of the Copa America which resulted in a 1-0 extra-time win for Argentina.

===Brazil===

Colombia had a more hostile rivalry against Brazil due to the 2014 FIFA World Cup encounter, where Brazil defeated Colombia 2–1 overshadowed by Neymar&#x27;s injury and referee&#x27;s favoritism towards Brazil against Colombia. This would later cause matches between the two national teams to be more intense, aggressive and to a certain extent, played with great hostility with numerous violent incidents, especially during the 2015 Copa América, where Neymar was sent off during a brawl after the final whistle after the Brazilian side suffered defeat, as well during the quarter-final match of the football tournament of the 2016 Summer Olympics between the two teams.

The rivalry would soon improve in a less hostile manner after the 2016 Copa Sudamericana Finals when Atlético Nacional asked CONMEBOL to award the trophy for Associação Chapecoense de Futebol due to the LaMia Flight 2933 crash; Nonetheless, it remains a competitive rivalry between the two which often sparks heated episodes among players of both teams.

===Ecuador===
Although the head-to-head record showcases a one-sided advantage for Colombia, the increase of the footballing level in the neighboring nation of Ecuador during recent years has ended in close matches between the two teams. After Colombia was unable to obtain more than one point from six possible during the 2022 qualifiers (when the side often obtained four or six points from the encounters), including a historic 6–1 defeat against Ecuador in 2020, media began calling the match the new classic of the region, citing its potential for continuing to bring close matches with no clear favorites added to a new competitive atmosphere between both teams.

==Home stadium==
Colombia plays their qualifying matches and friendlies at the Estadio Metropolitano Roberto Meléndez in Barranquilla, which is the home stadium of the local football team Atlético Junior. The stadium is named after former Colombia national team player Roberto Meléndez, who is widely considered to be Colombia&#x27;s best player during the Colombia&#x27;s amateur era in the 1930s–1940s. Curiously, the stadium was used for all of Colombia&#x27;s successful qualification campaigns for the World Cups in Italy (1990), United States (1994), France (1998). Additionally, the venue was used for the qualification process for Germany (2006), where Colombia were unsuccessful. However, it hosted the qualification matches for the 2014 and 2018 FIFA World Cups, where Colombia returned to the World Cup finals after a 16-year absence.

The Estadio Nemesio Camacho El Campín in the capital city of Bogotá acts as the national team&#x27;s alternative stadium. The stadium is the playing ground of local clubs Millonarios and Santa Fe. Notably, El Campín is remembered for hosting Colombia&#x27;s 2001 Copa América final against Mexico, where the team achieved its first international trophy after winning the match 1–0.

==Team image==

Traditionally, Colombia&#x27;s home colours are yellow shirts with navy trim and navy or white shorts and socks, with their away colours being normally navy shirts. They wore their first ever red kit at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Colombia used red as their home colours in the 20th century, although in Copa América Centenario the team played in an all-white kit for the first time in their history, before reverting to the yellow and navy kit thereafter.

<doc id="680176" wikidata="Q7542225" url="?curid=680176" title="Slug barrel">
<text>A slug barrel is a shotgun barrel that is designed primarily to fire slugs instead of shot, and is usually rifled. A shotgun with such a barrel is often called a slug gun.

==Origins==
When slugs are fired in a standard, choked barrel, the slug is deformed by the choke as it exits. The degree of deformation is most acute with fuller chokes, which were among the most widely used in stock shotguns up until the 1980s and 1990s. Early shotgun slugs were &quot;rifled&quot; with deformable fins cast into the outside of the soft lead slug, which allowed the slug to swage down to fit the choke. With an open choke, the reduction in diameter is minimal, so accuracy does not suffer much; tighter chokes, however, deform the slug enough to impact accuracy significantly, and the impact of the slug on the choke (at velocities around 450 meters per second (1500 feet per second)) could also stretch the barrel with repeated firings.

==The first slug barrels==
The first slug barrels were cylinder bore barrels (no choke) outfitted with rifle sights, which are far better suited to accurate shooting of still targets than the standard bead sight used for shooting small, fast moving targets with shot. Most pump-action and semi-automatic shotguns have barrels that can easily be changed in under a minute without tools, so having more than one barrel for a single shotgun is common. With the addition of a slug barrel, the standard shotgun used for bird hunting, skeet, or trap shooting can then be used for hunting medium to large game, such as deer or elk at ranges of over 100 meters (109 yards).

==The rifled slug barrel==
The next step was the fully rifled shotgun barrel by Hastings, a manufacturer of aftermarket shotgun barrels. Hasting&#x27;s Paradox shotgun barrels were offered as aftermarket replacements for the most common brands of pump and semi-automatic shotguns and they quickly became popular with slug shooters. Hastings rifled shotgun barrels are designed for firing slugs and are not to be confused with barrels of the Holland &amp; Holland Paradox gun. &quot;Paradox&quot; has been used by Holland &amp; Holland of London since the late 19th century to describe large bore guns with the last few inches of the barrel rifled with a special &quot;ratchet&quot; style of rifling. Holland &amp; Holland purchased the rights to the Paradox gun from the inventor, Col George Vincent Fosbery VC. They chose the name &quot;Paradox&quot; because shotguns are defined by their smoothbore barrels, and a &quot;rifled shotgun&quot; was something of a contradiction in terms. Holland &amp; Holland&#x27;s Paradox and Nitro-Paradox guns are not slug guns as they fire standard shotgun shells and cartridges with special Paradox bullets fully interchangeably. Under normal circumstances, any firearm with a rifled barrel over 12.7 millimeters (.50 inches) is legally considered a destructive device in the United States. A BATFE ruling was obtained stating that a firearm designed to fire shotgun shells that was converted to fire shotgun slugs with the addition of a rifled barrel was still a shotgun, and thus not a destructive device. Now many manufacturers offer shotguns for sale with rifled barrels already installed. Bolt action and single-shot break-action designs are particularly accurate. With the use of modern saboted slugs designed only for rifled barrels, the modern slug gun offers nearly the accuracy of a typical rifle, though at much shorter ranges.

==New slug technology==
The widespread availability of rifled shotgun barrels was quickly followed by the introduction of special slugs designed for use with the rifled barrels. The short, fat, unaerodynamic Foster slug was no longer needed for its inherent stability; new slugs were smaller in diameter, usually around 10.16 to 12.7 millimeters (.40 to .50 caliber) (compared to the 18.5 millimeter (.73 inch) bore diameter of a 12 gauge), and carried in a plastic sabot. The saboted slug had half the frontal area of the old slugs, which translated to less drag, and greater penetration. Lighter, faster slugs were also possible, allowing for a flatter trajectory and longer range. With the wide selection of barrels, shotshells and slugs, the modern shotgun is a tremendously versatile tool.

==Shotgun slugs for safety==
While shotgun slugs were originally developed as a convenience to the hunter who already owned a shotgun and did not want to purchase a rifle for hunting game, many heavily populated jurisdictions now allow large game hunting &quot;only&quot; with shotguns. The limited range of the slow, heavy slug—even a saboted slug—compared to a rifle bullet offers a safety advantage by limiting the maximum range. While buckshot is capable of taking deer-sized game, it is only effective at short ranges, generally under 50 yards (46 meters). A properly selected barrel and slug load can increase the range to 150 yards (137 meters) or more.

<text>Adam Marczyński (24 December 1908 – 13 January 1985) was a Polish painter. He died in Kraków.
Marczyński came into his own as an artist of post-war Kraków.

He studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Kraków. He started exhibiting in 1933 and had his first solo exhibition a few years after that. Marczyński taught at the academy from 1945 to 1979. One of his students at the academy was Zbigniew Żupnik. Besides teaching, he was a painter, did illustrations, was a graphic artist, and even did scenery design.

Around the war years, he embraced cubism and a Polish variation of post-Impressionism, called Colorism. Marczyński painted landscapes, portraits, still lifes, and interiors.

In the 1960s, he abandoned regular painting techniques, instead choosing to paint objects and make collages. By the &#x27;70s, Marczyński began making compositions in small cases. These items have doors that open and close; they became his main artistic focus.

Marczyński exhibited at many international art festivals, including the Venice Biennale in 1956 and the documenta II in Kassel in 1959. A catalogue was published in 1985 at a posthumous retrospective at the Gallery of the Office of Artistic Exhibitions in Kraków. His work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics.

<doc id="680198" wikidata="Q3567861" url="?curid=680198" title="Who Wants to Be a Millionaire – Play It!">
<text>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire – Play It! was a game show taping mock-up at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios (formerly &quot;Disney-MGM Studios&quot;) theme park at Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida, and Disney California Adventure at Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California. The attraction was a modified version of the &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot; television game show.

==Game information==
The attraction&#x27;s theater was a replica of the television show. Sessions of the game ran several times a day; each session was 25 minutes long (but did wait until the current contestant vacated the hot seat to stop) and seated 647 park guests. The multiple hosts that were used for the attraction were various Disney cast members who tried to emulate U.S. primetime host Regis Philbin&#x27;s hosting style, including his mannerisms.

The Disney park version of the game differed from the television version in several ways:
* Contestants competed for points, not dollars. A contestant won a Disney collector&#x27;s pin for each point level they passed (minus any down to the previous milestone if they got a question wrong). A prize table can be found below.
* Every audience member had their own A/B/C/D keypad. The ten contestant row seats were not special in any way (other than a video display of the camera work). Access to these seats were chosen in a number of different ways before the show, including random selection, quizzing of guests waiting in queue, and special &quot;Magic Moment&quot; coupons dispensed from the attraction&#x27;s &quot;Fast Pass&quot; dispensers telling the bearer to present their Fast Pass to an attraction cast member for special seating. There were several times where just asking before the show began would grant access to one of these seats if they were still available for the next show.
* To begin a session, a fastest finger question was asked. The audience member who got the correct answer in the shortest time got the hot seat.
* The hot seat contestant had only fifteen seconds to answer each of the first five questions (100-1,000 points), thirty seconds per question for the next five questions (2,000-32,000 points), forty-five seconds for the next four questions (64,000-500,000 points), and fifty-five seconds for the final million-point question; the real show internationally carried a variation of this format from 2008 to 2010.
* Each audience member could answer a question on their keypad at the same time as the hot seat contestant did. Contestants won points by pressing the correct button quickly; at the 1,000 and 32,000-point levels the game was paused briefly to show the top ten scores. If the hot seat contestant got a question wrong or decided to walk away, instead of additional fastest finger questions, the top scorer in the audience took his place, as long as there was time remaining. (Usually, only two full games were played.) The player with the highest score on the last game only won congratulations from the host, if that.
* The three lifelines were 50:50, Ask the Audience, or Phone a Complete Stranger. Ask the Audience is immediate; the audience&#x27;s answers can be instantly polled, because the audience already had a chance to enter their answers. Phone a Complete Stranger connected the contestant to a Cast Member outside the theater who found a guest to help.
* Disney Cast Members were not permitted to participate.
* Park guests playing as hot-seat contestants were required to sign a waiver after completing their game. This waiver declared the &quot;Fair Market Value&quot; of all prizes received (in Walt Disney World by regulations set by the Florida Gaming Commission) and an agreement that the guest would be ineligible to participate as a hot seat game player for a pre-determined amount of time (100-500,000 point winners had a 30-day blackout, while 1,000,000 point winners also had the 30-day blackout and were also prohibited from winning the million-point prize again for 365 days).
* Questions based on Disney parks and films often appeared at any point during the game.
* Usually, because the Fastest Finger question could be won by a younger audience member randomly selecting the correct one of the 24 possible orders and inputting it in a ridiculously small amount of time, the first five questions were usually easy enough that anyone in the audience could answer them correctly.

==Prizes==
Upon correctly answering each question, the player received a collectible lapel pin with the attraction&#x27;s logo and question point value. Various other prizes were awarded at milestone questions. The chart below references all the prizes obtained by achieving each milestone. No cash prize was awarded.

In the early days of the attractions, contestants would also receive a copy of the &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot; CD-ROM game upon correctly answering the 32,000 point question.

During the original television run of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;, contestants would receive a trip for two to New York City to see a taping of the television game when correctly answering the Million point question, in lieu of a Disney Cruise vacation.

===Special events===
During Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios&#x27; &quot;Star Wars Weekends,&quot; the first two games of the day featured questions based on the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films and universe and began with Greedo in the hot seat, answering questions in the alien language Rodanese. The lifelines in the &quot;Star Wars Weekends&quot; version of the game worked exactly like the regular game but were named 50:50, Ask the Jedi Council, and Phone a Stormtrooper.

During &quot;ESPN The Weekend&quot;, also based at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios, &quot;Play It!&quot; consisted of sports trivia questions; contestants got to &quot;team up&quot; with ESPN personalities and sports figures. For this edition of the game, the &quot;Phone A Complete Stranger&quot; lifeline was replaced with a chance to ask an ESPN expert (either Howie Schwab or the Sklar Twins) for assistance.

== History ==
Both versions of the attraction at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios and Disney California Adventure offered FASTPASS on these attractions. FASTPASS at Disney California Adventure was available for the whole run, while the version at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios was taken out when the &quot;Lights, Motors, Action!: Extreme Stunt Show&quot; opened in 2005.

The attraction&#x27;s former sound stages at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios are now the site of the interactive Toy Story Midway Mania! attraction.

The sound stage and &quot;Millionaire&quot; attraction at Disney California Adventure were built in an effort to improve the park after it faced criticism and low attendance upon its opening in February 2001.

When the &quot;Millionaire&quot; attraction in Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios (Orlando, Florida) closed, most of the props from the studio were removed and given to a 3rd party company who sold them online. Such items include all of the audience member keypads, fastest-finger chairs, monitor covers and more. Jeff Gross (former $500,000 winner on the U.S. syndicated version of the show, and also a contestant on the British version of the show where he won £64,000 and witnessed the coughing antics of Tecwen Whittock) announced in November 2008 during an appearance as an &#x27;expert&#x27; for Millionaire&#x27;s new &quot;Ask the Expert&quot; lifeline, that he was the successful bidder for the auction of Play It!&#x27;s contestant hot seat. The hot seat reportedly sold on eBay for more than $400.

In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Disney California Adventure &quot;Play It!&quot; sign from the building exterior was on display while the former attraction&#x27;s soundstage was temporarily converted to the Backlot Premiere Shop.

=== TV broadcasts ===
On several occasions over three years, the attraction at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios hosted tapings of the syndicated television show for later broadcast.

<doc id="680206" wikidata="Q2003611" url="?curid=680206" title="Indian Overseas Bank">
<text>Indian Overseas Bank (IOB) is an Indian public sector bank based in Chennai. During the nationalisation, IOB was one of the 14 major banks taken over by the government of India. On 5 December 2021, IOB got Degidhan Award 2020–21 by Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology for achieving second highest percentage of digital payment transaction among public sector banks.

As on 31 March 2022, IOB&#x27;s total business stands at . It has about 3,269 domestic branches, 2 DBUs ( Digital Banking Unit) about 4 foreign branches and representative office. Founded in February 1937 by M. Ct. M. Chidambaram Chettyar with twin objectives of specializing in FOREX and overseas banking.

==History==
===Pre-World War II===
In 1937, M. Ct. M. Chidambaram Chettyar established the Indian Overseas Bank to encourage overseas banking and foreign exchange operations. IOB started up simultaneously at three branches, one each in Karaikudi, Madras, and Rangoon (Yangon). It quickly opened a branch in Penang, Kuala Lumpur (1937 or 1938), and another in Singapore (1937 or 1941). The bank served the Nattukottai Chettiars, who were a mercantile class that at the time had spread from Chettinad in Tamil Nadu state to Ceylon (Sri Lanka), Burma (Myanmar), Malaya, Singapore, Java, Sumatra, and Saigon. As a result, from the beginning IOB specialised in foreign exchange and overseas banking (see below). Due to the war, IOB lost its branches in Rangoon and Penang, and Singapore, though the branch in Singapore resumed operations in 1942 under Japanese supervision.

===After World War II===
In 1945 or 1946 IOB opened a branch in Colombo. In 1947, IOB opened a branch in Bangkok. Then IOB added a branch each in Ipoh, Klang, and Malacca, all in Malaya. Some years later, in 1955, IOB opened its first branch in Hong Kong. Others would follow.

In 1963, the revolutionary government in Burma nationalised Indian Overseas Bank&#x27;s branches in Rangoon, Mandalay, and Moulmein, which became People&#x27;s Bank No. 4.

In the 1960s, the banking sector in India was consolidating through the merger of weak private sector banks with stronger ones. IOB acquired a number of local banks: Coimbatore Standard Bank (acq. 1963; one branch at Madras), Nanjinnad Bank (or Nanjanad Bank), Coimbatore Vasunthara Bank (or Coimbatore Vasundara Bank; est. June 1924; Head office and three branches; acq. 1964), Kulitalai Bank (est. 1933; acq. 1964; six branches), Srinivasa Perumal Bank (est. November 1935 at Coimbatore; acq. 1966), and (Sri/Lord) Venkateswara Bank (est. June 1931 as Salem Shevapet Sri Venkateswara Bank; acq. 1967; two branches in Salem, Tamil Nadu).

Then in 1969, the Government of India nationalized IOB. At one point, probably before nationalization, IOB had twenty of its eighty branches located overseas. However, Malaysian law forbade foreign government ownership of banks in Malaysia. After nationalization Indian Overseas Bank, like all the nationalized banks, turned inward, emphasizing the opening of branches in rural India.

In 1973, IOB, Indian Bank, and United Commercial Bank established United Asian Bank Berhad in Malaysia. (Indian Bank had been operating in Malaysia since 1941 and United Commercial Bank had been operating there since 1948.) The banks set up United Asian to comply with the Banking Law in Malaysia, which prohibited foreign government banks from operating in the country. Each contributed their operations in Malaysia to the new joint-venture bank, with each of the three-parent banks owning a third of the shares. At the time, Indian Bank had three branches, and Indian Overseas Bank and United Commercial Bank had eight between them. Also, IOB and six Indian private banks established Bharat Overseas Bank as a Chennai-based private bank to take over IOB&#x27;s Bangkok branch.

In 1977, IOB opened a branch in Seoul. It also opened a branch in Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, Hong Kong. Two years later, IOB opened a foreign currency banking unit in Colombo, Sri Lanka.

In 1983, ethnic sectarian violence in the form of anti-Tamil riots resulted in the burning of IOB&#x27;s branch in Colombo. Indian Bank, which may have had stronger ties to the Sinhalese population, escaped unscathed.

In 1988–89, IOB acquired Bank of Tamil Nadu, and its 99 branches, in a rescue. Bank of Tamil Nadu (or Bank of Tamilnad), had been established in 1903 in Tirunelveli as the South India Bank.

In 1992, Bank of Commerce (BOC), a Malaysian bank, acquired United Asian Bank (UAB).

===The new millennium===
In 2000, IOB engaged in an initial public offering (IPO) that brought the government&#x27;s share in the bank&#x27;s equity down to 75%. In 2001 IOB acquired the Mumbai-based Adarsha Janata Sahakari Bank, which gave it a branch in Mumbai. Then in 2009 IOB took over Shree Suvarna Sahakari Bank, which was founded in 1969 and had its head office in Pune. Shree Suvarna Sahakari Bank had been in administration since 2006. It had nine branches in Pune, two in Mumbai and one in Shirpur. The total employee strength was estimated to be little over 100.

IOB opened an extension counter at New Kathiresan Temple complex, Bambalapitiya, Sri Lanka, on 29 August 2003.

In 2005 IOB opened a representative office in Guangzhou, China. The next year IOB opened another representative office, this time in Kuala Lumpur. In 2009 IOB opened a Representative office in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

In the new millennium, international expansion picked up once again. In 2007, IOB took over Bharat Overseas Bank. Then in 2009 IOB acquired Pune-based Shree Suvarna Sahakari Bank, which had been established in 1969; the bank had nine branches in Pune, two in Mumbai, and one in Shripur.

In 2010 Malaysia awarded a commercial banking license to a locally incorporated bank to be jointly owned by Bank of Baroda, Indian Overseas Bank and Andhra Bank. The new bank, India International Bank (Malaysia), commenced operations in 2012 in Kuala Lumpur, which has a large population of Indians. Andhra Bank holds a 25% stake in the joint-venture, Bank of Baroda owns 40%, and IOB the remaining 35%.

IOB opened an Offshore Banking Unit in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on 31 August 2013. The bank also upgraded its existing Extension Counter at Bambalapitiya into a full-fledged branch.

As of March-2024, IOB has 3236 branches, 3506 ATMs and 6379 business correspondents across the country.

<text>West Punjab (; ) was a province in the Dominion of Pakistan from 1947 to 1955. It was established from the western-half of British Punjab, following the independence of Pakistan. The province covered an area of 159,344 km sq (61523 sq mi), including much of the current Punjab province and the Islamabad Capital Territory, but excluding the former Princely state of Bahawalpur. Lahore, being the largest city and the cultural centre, served as the capital of the province. The province was composed of four divisions (Lahore, Sargodha, Multan and Rawalpindi) and was bordered by the state of Bahawalpur to the south-east, the province of Baluchistan to the south-west and Sind to the south, North-West Frontier Province to the north-west, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir to the north. It shared International border with Indian state of East Punjab to the east and Indian-administered Jammu &amp; Kashmir to the north-east. It was dissolved and merged into West Pakistan upon creation of One Unit Scheme, in 1955.

==History==
The creation of Pakistan in 1947 led to the division of the Punjab Province of British India into two new provinces. The largely Sikh and Hindu East Punjab became part of the new nation of India while the largely Muslim West Punjab became part of the new nation of the Dominion of Pakistan. The name of the province was shortened to Punjab in 1950. West Punjab was merged into the province of West Pakistan in 1955 under the One Unit policy announced by Prime Minister Chaudhary Muhammad Ali. When that province was dissolved, the area of the former province of West Punjab was combined with the former state of Bahawalpur to form a new Punjab Province.

==Government==
The offices of Governor of West Punjab and Chief Minister of West Punjab lasted from 15 August 1947, until 14 October 1955. The first Governor was Sir Francis Mudie with Iftikhar Hussain Khan as the first Chief Minister. Both offices were abolished in 1955, when the province of West Pakistan was created. The last Governor of West Punjab, Mushtaq Ahmad Gurmani, became the first Governor of West Pakistan.

== Demographics ==
=== Religion ===
==== 1901 census ====

==== 1921 census ====

==== 1941 census ====

At Independence there was a Muslim majority in West Punjab with a significant Hindu and Sikh minority. Nearly all of these minorities left West Punjab for India, to be replaced by large numbers of Muslims fleeing from the opposite direction. 
=== Language ===
The official language of West Punjab was Urdu but most of the population spoke Punjabi. The linguist George Abraham Grierson in his multi volume Linguistic Survey of India (1904–1928) considered the various dialects up to then called &quot;Western Punjabi&quot;, spoken in North, West, and South of Lahore in what is now Pakistani Punjab, as constituting instead a distinct language from Punjabi. (The local dialect of Lahore is the Majhi dialect of Punjabi, which has long been the basis of standard literary Punjabi.) Grierson proposed to name this putative language &quot;Lahnda&quot;, and he dubbed as &quot;Southern Lahnda&quot; the coherent dialect cluster now known as Saraiki spoken in Multan Dera Ghazi Khan and Bahawalpur division and &quot;North Lahnda&quot; now known as Potwari spoken in Rawalpindi division and &quot;Western Lahnda&quot; now known as Hindko spoken in the regions bordering Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.

==Contemporary usage==
The term is often used to refer to the Pakistani Punjab.

<text>Martynas Mažvydas (1510 – 21 May 1563) was a Protestant author who edited the first printed book in the Lithuanian language.

Variants of his name include Martinus Masvidius, Martinus Maszwidas, M. Mossuids Waytkūnas, Mastwidas, Mažvydas, Mosvidius, Maswidsche, and Mossvid Vaitkuna.

==Biography==

Mažvydas was a prolific 16th century Lithuanian author, who is associated with the beginnings of Lithuanian literature. He was of Samogitian origin, born near Žemaičių Naumiestis (now in Šilutė district municipality) in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania; his parents were said to be indigent townspeople. Mažvydas spent his youth in Vilnius, where he worked together with other pioneering Lithuanian authors from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, such as Abraomas Kulvietis, Jurgis Zablockis, and possibly Stanislovas Rapolionis. Later Mažvydas would publish some of their works.

In Roman Catholic Lithuania Mažvydas was persecuted for his Protestant leanings, which motivated him to accept an invitation from Duke Albrecht of Prussia to come to Königsberg. He entered Albertina University in 1546; in 1548 he graduated from the university with a bachelor&#x27;s degree. The fact that Mažvydas graduated in one-and-a-half years suggests that he had studied elsewhere before – possibly in Kraków, or at the school established by Kulvietis in Vilnius. It has also been suggested that he was teaching at Albertina University.

To spread the new Protestant faith in Prussia, Duke Albrecht commissioned the translation and publication of Lutheran texts in Old Prussian and Lithuanian. In the year 1547, while still a student in Königsberg, Mažvydas and his collaborators compiled and published the first printed Lithuanian book &quot;Catechismusa Prasty Szadei&quot; (&quot;The Simple Words of Catechism&quot;) at the Hans Weinreich printing works in an edition of no more than 300 copies. It was based on the Polish version of Martin Luther&#x27;s &quot;Kleiner Katechismus&quot;. This book shows characteristics of the Samogitian dialect of Lithuanian, with clearly visible Aukštaitian traits. It was printed at about the same time as the first books in neighbouring nations&#x27; languages: Polish in 1513 or 1514, Belarusian in 1522, Estonian in 1535, and Latvian in 1585.

In 1549, Mažvydas was appointed a priest in Ragainė, in the present-day town of Neman. In the same year he wrote and published &quot;The Song of St. Ambrosy&quot;, with a dedication in Lithuanian. In 1554 Mažvydas became the Archdeacon of Ragainė. He oversaw the education of his parishioners, regulated agricultural matters, and continued his literary work in Lithuanian. He translated &quot;The Form of Baptism&quot; from German into Lithuanian and published it in Königsberg in 1559. Between 1558 and 1562 he published &quot;The Prussian Agenda&quot; into the prayer &quot;Paraphrasis&quot;, published in Königsberg in 1589, after the death of the translator. Another of his major works is &quot;The Christian Songs&quot; (&quot;Gesmes Chriksczoniskas, Gedomas Baszniczosu Per Aduenta ir Kaledas ik Gramniczu&quot;) (Part I, in 1566; Part II, in 1570), printed by his cousin Baltramiejus Vilentas. This book served as a basis for other Protestant books of songs that would later be published in Lithuania Minor.

Mažvydas initiated the patterns of several genres of Lithuanian literature: a primer; a catechism; a book of songs with notes; a prayer book; a translation of Holy Writ; and original prefaces and dedications.

He died in Königsberg (now Kaliningrad), aged about 53.

==The Catechism==
In the year 1547 Mažvydas compiled and published the first printed Lithuanian book – the Catechism (&quot;The Simple Words of Catechism&quot;), that was the beginning of literature and printing in Lithuanian. The book was printed in Königsberg.

The book consists of the dedication in Latin &quot;To the Grand Duchy of Lithuania&quot;, two prefaces: one in Latin (in prose), and one in Lithuanian (in verse), a primer, the catechism, and the book of songs. The rhymed preface in Lithuanian, &quot;The Appeal of The Small Book Itself Unto Lithuanians and Samogitians&quot;, is the first authentic verse in Lithuanian. An acrostic, the initial letters of its lines from 3 to 19 downwards, form the name of the author, Martinus Masvidius, thus confirming his authorship.

The prefaces state the aims of the author, namely, to educate people and spread culture, to fight the remains of heathen beliefs, and to consolidate the Protestant religion. The style of the preface is distinctly rhetorical; it is the most prominent example of syntactical-intonational prosody in Lithuanian literature.

Approximately 200 copies were printed; only two have survived. One is held at the Vilnius University Library in Lithuania, and another at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń Library in Poland.

<text>Thomas Lowry (February 27, 1843 – February 4, 1909) was an American lawyer, real-estate magnate, and businessman who oversaw much of the early growth of the streetcar lines in the Twin Cities area of Minneapolis, St. Paul, and surrounding communities in Minnesota. He became head of the Minneapolis Street Railway Co., later to become part of Twin City Rapid Transit (TCRT). He is not known to be a relative of Sylvanus Lowry, the slaveholder and profiteer of slavery-related enterprise from St. Cloud, Minnesota.

Lowry was born in Logan County, Illinois, and came to Minneapolis in 1867 after passing the bar to become a lawyer. He set up shop and quickly found much of his work to be related to real-estate deals. Soon, real-estate became his primary focus. In 1875, he was recruited to join the Minneapolis Street Railway, which was rushing to begin operations. Two years later, in 1877, he had a controlling interest in the company. He managed the company and organized finances, while his brother-in-law Calvin Gibson Goodrich handled other details. In the early days, Lowry spent a lot of time arranging loans so the railway could be expanded. Lowry had the idea to extend rails out into areas that had not yet been developed, much of that land being owned by him.

His company merged with the rail line of St. Paul after the first &quot;interurban&quot; line connected the Twin Cities. The merger became effective at the beginning of 1892. In 1898, TCRT began building a number of its own streetcars, rather than purchasing them from other companies. The first one of these was a special car for Lowry that had large window panes at one end so that he could see more as the car traveled through the region. It was used by the company on several special occasions, and United States President William McKinley made use of it on a visit to Minneapolis around 1900.
Lowry also served as president of what would become Soo Line Railroad from 1889 to 1890 and again from 1892 to 1909.

Lowry married Beatrice Goodrich. The couple had a son, Horace Lowry, on February 4, 1880. Horace would eventually follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps, becoming president of Twin City Rapid Transit until his death on August 22, 1931. Lowry Sr. was a member and benefactor of the First Universalist Church of Minneapolis (a.k.a. Church of the Redeemer).

Several sites in Minneapolis are named for Lowry because of his efforts to expand the rail system in the area. A memorial by Karl Bitter was dedicated to him at the intersection of Lyndale and Hennepin Avenue in 1915. Originally, the memorial was meant to serve as a welcome to the southwest neighborhoods of Minneapolis. The statue was moved to Smith Triangle Park on Hennepin Avenue in the 1960s due to the construction of the Lowry Hill Tunnel, which reconfigured the Hennepin/Lyndale intersection. Thomas Lowry Park is located at Douglas and Mount Curve Avenues in Lowry Hill, also in memorial of Thomas Lowry.

<doc id="680228" wikidata="Q8054834" url="?curid=680228" title="Yom Tov Tzahalon">
<text>Yom Tov ben Moshe Tzahalon (), also known as the Maharitz, ( 1559 – 1638, Safed, Eyalet of Sidon) was a student of Moses di Trani and Moshe Alshich, and published a collection of responsa.

Aged twenty-five, Tzahalon was requested by Rabbi Samuel Yafeh of Constantinople to decide a difficult and complicated problem which had been referred to himself and he corresponded with most of the authorities of his time, one of his chief antagonists being Moses Galante (the Elder). Although a Sephardi, Tzahalon rendered a decision in favour of an Ashkenazic congregation in a controversy which arose between the Sephardim and Ashkenazim at Jerusalem, and in his love of truth he did not spare even his teacher, Joseph Caro, declaring that the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; was written for children and laymen. Tzahalon was the author of a commentary on the Book of Esther, entitled &quot;Lekach Tov&quot; (Safed, 1577). He was the author of responsa and novellæ which were published with a preface by his grandson Yom-Tov (Venice, 1694), and he mentions also a second part, of which nothing more is known (Machon Yerushalayim has published more of his responsa in 1979). He likewise wrote a commentary on the &quot;Abot de-Rabbi Natan&quot;, entitled &quot;Magen Avot,&quot; which is still extant in manuscript. In his preface to this latter work Tzahalon terms himself Yom-Tov ben Moses ha-Sefardi, whence it is clear that the family came originally from Spain, although it is not known when it emigrated or where Tzahalon was born.

<text>The following is a list of national and international statistical services.

==Central national statistical services==
Nearly every country in the world has set a central public sector unit entirely devoted to the production, harmonisation and dissemination of official statistics that the public sector and the national community need to run, monitor and evaluate their operations and policies. This central statistical organisation does not produce every official statistic as other public sector organisations, like the national central bank or ministries in charge of agriculture, education or health, may be charged with producing and disseminating sector policy oriented statistical data. The statistical legislation and regulation generally attribute responsibilities and authorities according to statistical domains or functions in addition to those of the central unit.

The table below lists these central statistical organisations by country. The United States has no central producing unit, but several units (also listed below) have been given responsibility over various federal statistics domains (see also: Federal Statistical System of the United States).

===Africa===
===Americas===
===Asia===
===Europe===
(Institutions from countries marked with * are members of Eurostat&#x27;s European Statistical System (ESS).)
===Oceania===
==Autonomous statistical services at sub-national level==
Some countries are politically organised as federations of states or of autonomous regions; also a specific territory might have been given a partial autonomy. Several of these sub-national regional units have set their own quasi-independent statistical department. A list is presented in Sub-national autonomous statistical services

==International statistical services==

<text>Sul Ross State University (SRSU) is a public university in Alpine, Texas, United States. The main campus is the primary institution of higher education serving the nineteen-county Big Bend region of far West Texas. Branch campuses, branded as Rio Grande College, are located in Del Rio, Uvalde, Eagle Pass, and Castroville.

Named for former Texas governor and Confederate general Lawrence Sullivan Ross, the institution was founded in 1917 as Sul Ross Normal College and was made a university in 1969. It is governed by the Board of Regents of the Texas State University System.

==History== 

On April 14, 1914, Governor James E. Ferguson signed the bill selecting Alpine as the site for a normal school.

It received state university status in 1969.

<text>Highway 8, known as the &quot;Nicola Highway&quot;, is an alternate route to Highway 97C between Highway 1 and the Coquihalla Highway (Highway 5) in the Thompson-Nicola Regional District. Highway 8 was first numbered in 1953, and very little about the highway changed between that year and 2021, when large segments of the highway were washed out by floods.

Highway 8 follows the Nicola River for between Spences Bridge, on Highway 1, to Merritt on Highway 5.

==History==
Highway 8 is part of the first automobile route built to connect the Lower Mainland to the Alberta border. Named the &quot;Southern Trans-Provincial Highway&quot;, it ran from Vancouver to Crowsnest Pass and was later designated as &quot;Route A;&quot; the route followed Kingsway and Yale Road from Vancouver to Hope, then turned north to Spences Bridge. The route then turned southeast and passed through Merritt and Princeton along present-day Highway 8 and Highway 5A before travelling east along present-day Crowsnest Highway (Highway 3) towards Osoyoos, the Kootenays, and the Alberta border. In 1941, British Columbia transitioned from lettered to numbered highways, with the Lower Mainland section of Route A becoming Highway 1 and the remainder becoming Highway 3. After the end of World War II, the provincial government began to upgrade its highway system and constructed new sections of its highways. On November 2, 1949, the Hope-Princeton Highway through Allison Pass and Sunday Summit was opened, reducing the driving distance between Hope and Princeton from approximately to .

When the Okanagan Connector was constructed between Merritt and Kelowna in the late 1980s, initial proposals had it designated as Highway 8; however, communities on the route preferred it designated as an auxiliary route of Highway 97 and was designated as Highway 97C.

During the major floods in November 2021, large segments of the highway were washed out by the Nicola River. Further washouts occurred during repairs in mid-2022. On September 23, 2022, it was announced that highway had been reconnected for the first time since the washouts, enabling locals to use the highway. The highway subsequently reopened to the general public on November 9, nearly a year after the washouts.

<doc id="680237" wikidata="Q1367799" url="?curid=680237" title="Givens rotation">
<text>In numerical linear algebra, a Givens rotation is a rotation in the plane spanned by two coordinates axes. Givens rotations are named after Wallace Givens, who introduced them to numerical analysts in the 1950s while he was working at Argonne National Laboratory.

== As action on matrices ==
A Givens rotation acting on a matrix from the left is a row operation, moving data between rows but always within the same column. Unlike the elementary operation of row-addition, a Givens rotation changes both of the rows addressed by it. To understand how it is a rotation, one may denote the elements of one target row by formula_1 through formula_2 and the elements of the other target row by formula_3 through formula_4:
formula_5
Then the effect of a Givens rotation is to rotate each subvector formula_6 by the same angle. As with row-addition, algorithms often choose this angle so that one specific element becomes zero, and whatever happens in remaining columns is considered acceptable side-effects.

A Givens rotation acting on a matrix from the right is instead a column operation, moving data between two columns but always within the same row. As with action from the left, it rotates each subvector formula_6 by the same angle, but here these named elements occur in the matrix as
formula_8
Some algorithms, especially those concerned with preserving matrix similarity, apply Givens rotations as a conjugate action: both rotating by one angle between two rows, and rotating by the same angle between the corresponding columns. In this case the effect on the four elements affected by both rotations is more complicated; a Jacobi rotation is such a conjugate action to the end of zeroing the two off-diagonal elements among these four.

The main use of Givens rotations in numerical linear algebra is to transform vectors or matrices into a special form with zeros in certain coefficients. This effect can, for example, be employed for computing the QR decomposition of a matrix. One advantage over Householder transformations is that they can easily be parallelised, and another is that often for very sparse matrices they have a lower operation count.

== Matrix representation ==

A Givens rotation is represented by a matrix of the form

:formula_9

where and appear at the intersections th and th rows and columns. That is, for fixed , the non-zero elements of Givens matrix are given by:
:formula_10

The product represents a counterclockwise rotation of the vector in the plane of radians, hence the name Givens rotation.

== Stable calculation ==
When a Givens rotation matrix, , multiplies another matrix, , from the left, , only rows and of are affected. Thus we restrict attention to the following counterclockwise problem. Given and , find and such that
:formula_11
where formula_12 is the length of the vector formula_13.
Explicit calculation of is rarely necessary or desirable. Instead we directly seek and . An obvious solution would be
:formula_14

However, the computation for may overflow or underflow. An alternative formulation avoiding this problem is implemented as the hypot function in many programming languages.

The following Fortran code is a minimalistic implementation of Givens rotation for real numbers. If the input values &#x27;a&#x27; or &#x27;b&#x27; are frequently zero, the code may be optimized to handle these cases as presented here.
subroutine givens_rotation(a, b, c, s, r)

real a, b, c, s, r
real h, d

if (b .ne. 0.0) then
 h = hypot(a, b)
 d = 1.0 / h
 c = abs(a) * d
 s = sign(d, a) * b
 r = sign(1.0, a) * h
else
 c = 1.0
 s = 0.0
 r = a
end if

return
end

Furthermore, as Edward Anderson discovered in improving LAPACK, a previously overlooked numerical consideration is continuity. To achieve this, we require to be positive. The following MATLAB/GNU Octave code illustrates the algorithm. 
function [c, s, r] = givens_rotation(a, b)
 if b == 0;
 c = sign(a);
 if (c == 0);
 c = 1.0; % Unlike other languages, MatLab&#x27;s sign function returns 0 on input 0.
 end;
 s = 0;
 r = abs(a);
 elseif a == 0;
 c = 0;
 s = -sign(b);
 r = abs(b);
 elseif abs(a) &gt; abs(b);
 t = b / a;
 u = sign(a) * sqrt(1 + t * t);
 c = 1 / u;
 s = -c * t;
 r = a * u;
 else
 t = a / b;
 u = sign(b) * sqrt(1 + t * t);
 s = -1 / u;
 c = t / u;
 r = b * u;
 end
end
The IEEE 754 codice_1 function, provides a safe and cheap way to copy the sign of codice_2 to codice_3. If that is not available, , using the abs and sgn functions, is an alternative as done above.

== Triangularization ==
Given the following Matrix:

:formula_15

two iterations of the Givens rotation (note that the Givens rotation algorithm used here differs slightly from above) yield an upper triangular matrix in order to compute the QR decomposition.

In order to form the desired matrix, zeroing elements and is required; element is zeroed first, using a rotation matrix of:
:formula_16

The following matrix multiplication results:
:formula_17

where
:formula_18

Using these values for and and performing the matrix multiplication above yields :
:formula_19

Zeroing element finishes off the process. Using the same idea as before, the rotation matrix is:
:formula_20

Afterwards, the following matrix multiplication is:
:formula_21

where
:formula_22
Using these values for and and performing the multiplications results in :
:formula_23

This new matrix is the upper triangular matrix needed to perform an iteration of the QR decomposition. is now formed using the transpose of the rotation matrices in the following manner:

:formula_24

Performing this matrix multiplication yields:
:formula_25

This completes two iterations of the Givens Rotation and calculating the QR decomposition can now be done.

===QR iteration variant===
If performing the above calculations as a step in the QR algorithm for finding the eigenvalues of a matrix, then one next wants to compute the matrix formula_26, but one should not do so by first multiplying formula_27 and formula_28 to form formula_29, instead rather by multiplying each formula_30 by formula_31 (on the right). The reason for this is that each multiplication by a Givens matrix on the right changes only two columns of formula_32, thus requiring a mere formula_33 arithmetic operations, which for formula_34 Givens rotations sums up to formula_35 arithmetic operations; multiplying by the general formula_36 matrix formula_37 would require formula_38 arithmetic operations. Likewise, storing the full formula_37 matrix amounts to formula_40 elements, but each Givens matrix is fully specified by its pair formula_41 and formula_34 of them can thus be stored in formula_43 elements.

In the example,
formula_44

==Complex matrices==

Another method can extend Givens rotations to complex matrices. A diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements have unit magnitudes but arbitrary phases is unitary. Let A be a matrix for which it is desired to make the ji element be zero using the rows and columns i and j&gt;i. Let D be a diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are one except the ii and jj diagonal elements which also have unit magnitude but have phases which are to be determined. The phases of the ii and jj elements of D can be chosen so as to make the ii and ji elements of the product matrix D A be real. Then a Givens rotation G can be chosen using the i and j&gt;i rows and columns so as to make the ji element of the product matrix G D A be zero. Since a product of unitary matrices is unitary, the product matrix G D is unitary and so is any product of such matrix pair products.

==In Clifford algebras==

In Clifford algebras and its child structures such as geometric algebras, rotations are represented by bivectors. Givens rotations are represented by the exterior product of the basis vectors. Given any pair of basis vectors formula_45 Givens rotations bivectors are:

: formula_46

Their action on any vector is written:

: formula_47

where

: formula_48

==Dimension 3==
There are three Givens rotations in dimension 3:

:formula_49

:formula_50

:formula_51

Given that they are endomorphisms they can be composed with each other as many times as desired, keeping in mind that .

These three Givens rotations composed can generate any rotation matrix according to Davenport&#x27;s chained rotation theorem. This means that they can transform the standard basis of the space to any other frame in the space.

When rotations are performed in the right order, the values of the rotation angles of the final frame will be equal to the Euler angles of the final frame in the corresponding convention. For example, an operator formula_52 transforms the basis of the space into a frame with angles roll, pitch and yaw formula_53 in the Tait–Bryan convention &quot;z&quot;-&quot;x&quot;-&quot;y&quot; (convention in which the line of nodes is perpendicular to &quot;z&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; axes, also named &quot;Y&quot;-&quot;X′&quot;-&quot;Z″&quot;).

For the same reason, any rotation matrix in 3D can be decomposed in a product of three of these rotation operators.

The meaning of the composition of two Givens rotations is an operator that transforms vectors first by and then by , being and rotations about one axis of basis of the space. This is similar to the extrinsic rotation equivalence for Euler angles.

===Table of composed rotations===

The following table shows the three Givens rotations equivalent to the different Euler angles conventions using extrinsic composition (composition of rotations about the basis axes) of active rotations and the right-handed rule for the positive sign of the angles.

The notation has been simplified in such a way that means and means . The subindexes of the angles are the order in which they are applied using &quot;extrinsic&quot; composition (1 for intrinsic rotation, 2 for nutation, 3 for precession)

As rotations are applied just in the opposite order of the Euler angles table of rotations, this table is the same but swapping indexes 1 and 3 in the angles associated with the corresponding entry. An entry like &quot;zxy&quot; means to apply first the &quot;y&quot; rotation, then &quot;x&quot;, and finally &quot;z&quot;, in the basis axes.

All the compositions assume the right hand convention for the matrices that are multiplied, yielding the following results.

<text>BBC Newsline is the BBC&#x27;s national television news programme for Northern Ireland, broadcast on BBC One Northern Ireland from the headquarters of BBC Northern Ireland in Ormeau Avenue, Belfast.

As well as being available via all multi-channel outlets in Northern Ireland (including via Sky channel 101), the programme can be accessed by the rest of the United Kingdom (along with all other regional BBC news programmes) on the BBC iPlayer, or alternatively on Sky channel 973. Viewers from the Republic of Ireland with a Sky subscription can also watch on Sky channel 141. As the BBC UK regional TV on satellite service is broadcast unencrypted, it is possible to receive &quot;BBC Newsline&quot; anywhere in Europe using an appropriate receiver.

==Programme history==
&quot;BBC Newsline&quot; is the most recent incarnation of BBC Northern Ireland&#x27;s television news service, which began on Monday 30 September 1957 as part of the corporation&#x27;s rollout of regional television services. The first five-minute bulletins, &quot;Today in Northern Ireland&quot;, were presented by Maurice Shillington and broadcast from a tiny radio studio within Broadcasting House in Belfast.

Up until the launch of &quot;Today in Northern Ireland&quot;, a networked topical magazine programme, &quot;Ulster Mirror&quot;, had been broadcast every fortnight since Friday 26 November 1954. The new daily bulletins were later expanded to ten minutes and supplemented by a magazine programme called &quot;Studio Eight&quot;, first broadcast on Friday 20 February 1959 with Robert Coulter as its presenter. &quot;Today in Northern Ireland&quot; was replaced on 17 September 1962 by a 20-minute programme initially known as &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock&quot;. The new longer magazine programmes changed title to &quot;Six Five&quot; and &quot;Six Ten&quot; until &quot;Scene Around Six&quot; was introduced in January 1968.

&quot;Newsline 6:30&quot; was introduced on 12 February 1996 when the main evening programme returned to a 6.30pm timeslot. Although Noel Thompson and Lynda Bryans were the original choice of presenters, Thompson was later dropped causing Bryans to resign and move to UTV. The programme&#x27;s first presenters were political editor Jim Dougal and reporter Yvette Shapiro. Dougal was replaced as anchor by Conor Bradford after two months.
 &quot;BBC Newsline&quot; also introduced teletext subtitles for deaf viewers upon its launch. It became ‘’BBC Newsline’’ in 1999.

&quot;BBC Newsline&quot; is now presented by a single main anchor

In November 2021, Traynor had resigned from BBC Northern Ireland after 33 years, amid legal proceedings.

The following month, it was announced that Tara Mills and Declan Harvey will alternate as main anchors of &quot;BBC Newsline&quot; and the BBC Radio Ulster drivetime news programme, &quot;Evening Extra&quot;. Harvey joined the programme in early 2022.

<doc id="680250" wikidata="Q975137" url="?curid=680250" title="Underconsumption">
<text>Underconsumption is a theory in economics that recessions and stagnation arise from an inadequate consumer demand, relative to the amount produced. In other words, there is a problem of overproduction and overinvestment during a demand crisis. The theory formed the basis for the development of Keynesian economics and the theory of aggregate demand after the 1930s.

Underconsumption theory narrowly refers to heterodox economists in Britain in the 19th century, particularly from 1815 onwards, who advanced the theory of underconsumption and rejected classical economics in the form of Ricardian economics. The economists did not form a unified school, and their theories were rejected by mainstream economics of the time.

Underconsumption is an old concept in economics that goes back to the 1598 French mercantilist text &quot;Les Trésors et richesses pour mettre l&#x27;Estat en splendeur&quot; (&quot;The Treasures and riches to put the State in splendor&quot;) by Barthélemy de Laffemas, if not earlier. The concept of underconsumption had been used repeatedly as part of the criticism of Say&#x27;s law until underconsumption theory was largely replaced by Keynesian economics which points to a more complete explanation of the failure of aggregate demand to attain potential output, i.e., the level of production corresponding to full employment.

One of the early underconsumption theories says that because workers are paid a wage less than they produce, they cannot buy back as much as they produce. Thus, there will always be inadequate demand for the product.

==Theory==
In his book &quot;Underconsumption Theories&quot; from 1976, Michael Bleaney defined two main elements of classical (pre-Keynesian) underconsumption theory. First, the only source of recessions, stagnation, and other aggregate demand failures was inadequate consumer demand. Second, a capitalist economy tends toward a state of persistent depression because of this. Thus, underconsumption is not seen as part of business cycles as much as (perhaps) the general economic environment in which they occur. Compare to the tendency of the rate of profit to fall, which has a similar belief in stagnation as the natural (stable) state, but which is otherwise distinct and in critical opposition to underconsumption theory.

===Keynesian===
Modern Keynesian economics has largely superseded underconsumption theories. Falling consumer demand need not cause a recession, since other parts of aggregate demand may rise to counteract this effect. These other elements are private fixed investment in factories, machines, and housing, government purchases of goods and services, and exports (net of imports). Further, few economists believe that persistent stagnation is the normal state toward which a capitalist economy tends. But it is possible in Keynesian economics that falling consumption (say, due to low and falling real wages) can cause a recession or deepening stagnation.

===Marxian===

The case is frequently made that Marx&#x27;s position towards underconsumption is ambivalent. On the one hand, he wrote that &quot;the last cause of all real crises always remains the poverty and restricted consumption of the masses as compared to the tendency of capitalist production to develop the productive forces in such a way that only the absolute power of consumption of the entire society would be their limit.&quot;

However, in Volume II of Das Kapital, he provides the following critique of underconsumptionist theory:
&quot;It is sheer redundancy to say that crises are produced by the lack of paying consumption or paying consumers. The capitalist system recognizes only paying consumers, with the exception of those in receipt of poor law support or the &#x27;rogues.&#x27; When commodities are unsalable, it means simply that there are no purchasers, or consumers, for them. When people attempt to give this redundancy an appearance of some deeper meaning by saying that the working class does not receive enough of its own product and that the evil would be dispelled immediately it received a greater share, i.e., if its wages were increased, all one can say is that crises are invariably preceded by periods in which wages in general rise and the working class receives a relatively greater share of the annual product intended for consumption. From the standpoint of these valiant upholders of &#x27;plain common sense,&#x27; such periods should prevent the coming of crises. It would appear, therefore, that capitalist production includes conditions which are independent of good will or bad will. . .&quot; Marx argued that the primary source of capitalist crisis was not located in the realm of consumption, but rather, in production. In general, as Anwar Shaikh has argued, production creates the basis for consumption, because it puts purchasing power into the hands of workers and fellow capitalists. To produce anything requires the individual capitalist to buy machines (capital goods) and employ workers.

In Volume III, Part III of Das Kapital, Marx presents a theory of crisis which is solidly grounded in the contradictions he sees in the realm of capitalist production: the Tendency of the rate of profit to fall. He argues that as the capitalists compete with each other, they strive to replace human laborers with machines. This raises what Marx called &quot;the organic composition of capital.&quot; However, capitalist profit is based upon living, not &quot;dead&quot; (i.e., machine) labor. Thus as the organic composition of capital rises, the rate of profit tends to fall. Eventually, this will cause a fall in the mass of profit, giving way to decline and crisis.

Many advocates of Marxian economics reject underconsumptionist stagnation theories. However, Marxian economist James Devine has pointed to two possible roles for underconsumption in the business cycle and the origins of the Great Depression of the 1930s.

First, he interprets the dynamics of the U.S. economy in the 1920s as being one of over-investment relative to demand. Stagnant wages (relative to labor productivity) mean that working-class consumer spending also stagnates. As noted above, this does not mean that the economy as a whole must dwell in the economic cellar. In the 1920s, private fixed investment soared, as did &quot;luxury consumption&quot; by the capitalists, boosted by high profits and optimistic expectations. Some growth of working-class consumption occurred, but corresponded to increased indebtedness. (In theory, the government and foreign sectors could have also counteracted stagnation, but this did not happen in that era.) The problem with this kind of economic boom is that it becomes increasingly unstable, somewhat akin to a bubble affecting a financial market. Eventually (in 1929), the over-investment boom ended, leaving unused industrial capacity and debt obligations, discouraging immediate recovery. Note that Devine does not see all booms in these terms. In the late 1960s, the U.S. saw &quot;over-investment relative to supply,&quot; in which abundant accumulation pulls up wages and raw material costs, depressing the rate of profit on the supply side.

Second, once a recession has occurred (e.g., 1931–33), private investment can be blocked by debt, unused capacity, pessimistic expectations, and increasing social unrest. In this case, capitalists try to raise their rates of profit by cutting wages and raising labor productivity (by speeding up production). The problem is that while this may be rational for the individual, it is irrational for the capitalist class as a whole. Cutting wages relative to productivity lowers consumer demand relative to potential output. With other sources of aggregate demand blocked, this actually hurts profitability by lowering demand. Devine terms this problem the &quot;under-consumption trap&quot;.

== History ==

=== 16th century through 18th century – mercantilism ===
Underconsumption theory dates to the earlier economic theory of mercantilism, and an early history of underconsumptionism is given in &quot;Mercantilism&quot; by Eli Heckscher Underconsumption was a small part of mercantilist theory, in Heckscher&#x27;s view, but was discussed by a number of authors.

The earliest reference given was to Barthélemy de Laffemas, who in 1598 in &quot;The Treasures and riches to put the State in splendor&quot; &quot;denounced the objectors to the use of French silks on the ground that all purchasers of French luxury goods created a livelihood for the poor, whereas the miser caused them to die in distress,&quot; an early form of the paradox of thrift. A number of other 17th century authors, English, German, and French, stated similar sentiments, which Heckscher summarizes as:
:&quot;the deep-rooted belief in the utility of luxury and the evil of thrift. Thrift, in fact, was regarded as the cause of unemployment, and for two reasons: in the first place, because real income was believed to diminish by the amount of money which did not enter into exchange, and secondly, because saving was believed to withdraw money from circulation.&quot;

&quot;The Fable of The Bees&quot; by Bernard Mandeville, of 1714, was credited by Keynes as the most popular exposition of underconsumptionism of its time, but it caused such an uproar, being seen as an attack against Christian virtues, specifically attacking temperance, that underconsumptionism was not mentioned in &quot;respectable circles&quot; for another century, until it was raised in the later Malthus.

=== 19th century ===
Malthus devoted a chapter of &quot;Principles&quot; (1836) to underconsumption theory, which was rebutted by David Ricardo, in his &quot;Notes on Malthus,&quot; and which debate continued in private correspondence.

Malthus was credited by Keynes as a predecessor for his views on effective demand and, other than Malthus, Keynes did not credit the existence of other proponents of underconsumption, stating instead that Ricardo &quot;conquered&quot; English economics. This is now understood to be false – other British proponents of underconsumption are now well-established, but, as Keynes demonstrated, they were poorly documented, and by the 1930s not well-known. Further, they did not form a unified school, but rather related heterodox ideas.

The Birmingham School of economists argued an underconsumptionist theory from 1815, and some of the writings of the school&#x27;s leading member Thomas Attwood contained formulations of the multiplier effect and an income-expenditure model.

In continental Europe, Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi proposed underconsumption and overproduction as causes of the economic cycle, in his &quot;Nouveaux Principes d&#x27;économie politique&quot; (1819), in one of the earliest systematic treatments of economic cycles. Properly, Sismondi discussed periodic economic &quot;crises&quot;, while the notion of a &quot;cycle&quot; was devised by Charles Dunoyer in his reconciliation of Sismondi&#x27;s work with classical economics.

The multiplier dates to work in the 1890s by the Australian economist Alfred De Lissa, the Danish politician Julius Wulff, and the German-American economist Nicholas Johannsen, Nicholas Johannsen also proposed a theory of effective demand in the 1890s.

The paradox of thrift was stated in 1892 by John M. Robertson in his &quot;The Fallacy of Savings,&quot; and similar sentiments date to antiquity, in addition to the mercantilist statements cited above:
=== 20th century – pre-Keynes ===
An underconsumption theory of the economic cycle was given by John A. Hobson in his &quot;Industrial System&quot; (1910).

William Trufant Foster and Waddill Catchings developed a theory of underconsumption in the 1920s that became highly influential among policy makers. The argument was that governmental intervention, especially spending on public works programs, was essential to restore the balance between production and consumption. The theory strongly influenced Herbert Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt to engage in massive public works projects.

=== Legacy ===
Today these ideas, regardless of provenance, are grouped in academia under the rubric of &quot;Keynesian economics&quot;, due to Keynes&#x27;s role in consolidating, elaborating, and popularizing them. Keynes himself specifically discussed underconsumption (which he wrote &quot;under-consumption&quot;) in &quot;The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot;.

==Criticism==
The theory of underconsumption has been criticized by classical economists such as James Mill, Adam Smith who wrote &quot;What is prudence in the conduct of every private family can scarce be folly in that of a great Kingdom,&quot; and on grounds of Christian morality. These criticisms were revised by Austrian economics.

<doc id="680254" wikidata="Q502018" url="?curid=680254" title="Danish Football Association">
<text>The Danish Football Union (; DBU) is the governing body of football in Denmark. It is the organization of Danish football clubs and runs the professional Danish football leagues, alongside the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s national teams. Based in the city of Brøndby, it is a founding member of both FIFA and UEFA. The DBU has also been the governing body of futsal in Denmark since 2008.

==Beginnings==
The DBU was founded on 18 May 1889 and was the first national football association outside Great Britain and Ireland. However, it did not register games officially before the 1908 Summer Olympics, meaning that the win in the 1906 Intercalated Olympics tournament was not officially recorded by the DBU.

==List of presidents==
The following is a list of presidents since its creation in 1905.

==DBU competitions==
=== Men&#x27;s ===
*Leagues
**Superliga
**First Division ()
**Second Divisions () 
**Third Divisions () 
**Denmark Series () (4 groups)
*Cups
**DBU Pokalen

=== Women&#x27;s ===
*Leagues
**Elite Division ()
**First Division ()
**Second Division () (2 groups)
**Denmark Series women () (3 groups)
*Cups
*Cup ()

=== Defunct ===
* Landsfodboldturneringen (1913–1927)
* Provinsmesterskabsturneringen (1913–1931)
* Sylow-Tournament (1918–1926)

==Regional structure==

The DBU is separated into six regional associations, based on the former counties of Denmark:
* DBU Jutland, which in turn is separated into four regions:
** Region 1: Nordjylland County
** Region 2: Viborg and Ringkøbing counties
** Region 3: Århus and Vejle counties
** Region 4: Ribe and South Jutland counties
* DBU Funen: Funen County
* DBU Zealand: West Zealand, Roskilde, Frederiksborg, Copenhagen counties and Zealand part of Storstrøm County
* DBU Copenhagen: Frederiksberg and Copenhagen municipalities
* DBU Lolland-Falster: Non-Zealand part of Storstrøm County
* DBU Bornholm: Bornholm municipality

The Faroe Islands and Greenland, which are autonomous territories within Denmark, have their own football associations and are not part of the DBU. Greenland is not a member of FIFA or any continental federation, but the Faroe Islands are a member of both FIFA and UEFA.

==International teams==
The Denmark national football teams represents Denmark in international football competitions and is controlled by the DBU. , the teams consist of:

=== Women&#x27;s ===
*A-level National Team
*Under-23 National Team
*Under-19 National Team
*Under-17 National Team
*Under-16 National Team

=== Men&#x27;s ===
*A-level National Team
*Under-21 National Team
*Under-20 National Team
*Under-19 National Team
*Under-18 National Team
*Under-17 National Team
*Under-16 National Team
*Futsal National Team
*Oldboys National Team

==Yearly honours==

The DBU awards the best national team players each year, with an award to the best senior team player, as well as the best player in three of the DBU&#x27;s six national youth teams.

;Player of the Year
Since 1963, the DBU has awarded the Danish &quot;Player of the Year&quot; in a vote amongst the Danish players. In the time of amateur football, only players in the domestic league could achieve the prize, and even after the emergence of paid football in 1978, no players in foreign clubs were eligible for the award. When the award was finally opened to all Danish players, domestic and abroad, in 1983, national team captain Morten Olsen was the first player to win the &quot;Player of the Year&quot; award taking all Danish players into consideration. The record number of award wins is four, by Brian Laudrup (1989, 1992, 1995, and 1997).

;Young Players of the Year
The Young Players of the Year Awards on the other hand are sponsored by Arla Foods, the awards were initially known as (the Milk Talent Awards) in order to promote the line of dairy products of the company then known as MD Foods. DBU found new sponsor DONG (later DONG Energy), an oil company, in 2004 but Arla went on to sponsor the prize which was renamed (the Arla Talent Awards) in 2005.

==National team contract negotiations==
;Women&#x27;s national team

In 2017, the negotiations regarding terms and salary with the women&#x27;s national team broke down, causing DBU to cancel the world cup qualification match against Sweden.
The team lost the match 3–0 due to forfeit. DBU was handed a fine by the UEFA disciplinary committee. The national team and DBU came to an agreement before the match was supposed to be played, but the match was already cancelled.
The team then failed to qualify directly to the world cup. A playoff match will decide if the team will qualify to the world cup.

;Men&#x27;s national team
After the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the agreement between DBU and the men&#x27;s national team expired.
The negotiations about terms and salary are still ongoing. Currently DBU has selected a squad without any players from the top tier of international and national leagues.
The team is to play two matches. DBU refuses to negotiate before the end of the two matches.

The badge is still in use on the Danish men&#x27;s kit for the European Championship 2020 (so-named despite being played in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic).

<text>Highway 33 is a minor two to four-lane highway connecting the Boundary Country and Okanagan regions of British Columbia, Canada. Highway 33, which is 129 km (80 mi) long, connects Rock Creek, on the Crowsnest Highway (Highway 3), north to Kelowna, on the Okanagan Highway, partially following the West Kettle River. It is also the main access to the Big White Ski Resort, which is near the apex of the pass between the head of the West Kettle and metropolitan Kelowna. The only other visible community on Highway 33 is Beaverdell, 48 km (30 mi) north of Rock Creek. Highway 33 opened in 1970.

<doc id="680261" wikidata="Q5155306" url="?curid=680261" title="Compact element">
<text>In the mathematical area of order theory, the compact elements or finite elements of a partially ordered set are those elements that cannot be subsumed by a supremum of any non-empty directed set that does not already contain members above the compact element. This notion of compactness simultaneously generalizes the notions of finite sets in set theory, compact sets in topology, and finitely generated modules in algebra. (There are other notions of compactness in mathematics.)

== Formal definition ==

In a partially ordered set (&quot;P&quot;,≤) an element &quot;c&quot; is called &quot;compact&quot; (or &quot;finite&quot;) if it satisfies one of the following equivalent conditions:
* For every directed subset &quot;D&quot; of &quot;P&quot;, if &quot;D&quot; has a supremum sup &quot;D&quot; and &quot;c&quot; ≤ sup &quot;D&quot; then &quot;c&quot; ≤ &quot;d&quot; for some element &quot;d&quot; of &quot;D&quot;.
* For every ideal &quot;I&quot; of &quot;P&quot;, if &quot;I&quot; has a supremum sup &quot;I&quot; and &quot;c&quot; ≤ sup &quot;I&quot; then &quot;c&quot; is an element of &quot;I&quot;.

If the poset &quot;P&quot; additionally is a join-semilattice (i.e., if it has binary suprema) then these conditions are equivalent to the following statement:
* For every subset &quot;S&quot; of &quot;P&quot;, if &quot;S&quot; has a supremum sup &quot;S&quot; and &quot;c&quot; ≤ sup &quot;S&quot;, then &quot;c&quot; ≤ sup &quot;T&quot; for some finite subset &quot;T&quot; of &quot;S&quot;.
In particular, if &quot;c&quot; = sup &quot;S&quot;, then &quot;c&quot; is the supremum of a finite subset of &quot;S&quot;.

These equivalences are easily verified from the definitions of the concepts involved. For the case of a join-semilattice, any set can be turned into a directed set with the same supremum by closing under finite (non-empty) suprema.

When considering directed complete partial orders or complete lattices the additional requirements that the specified suprema exist can of course be dropped. A join-semilattice that is directed complete is almost a complete lattice (possibly lacking a least element)—see completeness (order theory) for details.

== Examples ==

* The most basic example is obtained by considering the power set of some set &quot;A&quot;, ordered by subset inclusion. Within this complete lattice, the compact elements are exactly the finite subsets of &quot;A&quot;. This justifies the name &quot;finite element&quot;.
* The term &quot;compact&quot; is inspired by the definition of (topologically) compact subsets of a topological space &quot;T&quot;. A set &quot;Y&quot; is compact if for every collection of &quot;open&quot; sets &quot;S&quot;, if the union over &quot;S&quot; includes &quot;Y&quot; as a subset, then &quot;Y&quot; is included as a subset of the union of a finite subcollection of &quot;S&quot;. Considering the power set of &quot;T&quot; as a complete lattice with the subset inclusion order, where the supremum of a collection of sets is given by their union, the topological condition for compactness mimics the condition for compactness in join-semilattices, but for the additional requirement of openness.
* If it exists, the least element of a poset is always compact. It may be that this is the only compact element, as the example of the real unit interval [0,1] (with the standard ordering inherited from the real numbers) shows.
* Every completely join-prime element of a lattice is compact.

== Algebraic posets ==

A poset in which every element is the supremum of the directed set formed by the compact elements below it is called an &quot;algebraic poset&quot;. Such posets that are dcpos are much used in domain theory.

As an important special case, an &quot;algebraic lattice&quot; is a complete lattice &quot;L&quot; where every element &quot;x&quot; of &quot;L&quot; is the supremum of the compact elements below &quot;x&quot;.

A typical example (which served as the motivation for the name &quot;algebraic&quot;) is the following:

For any algebra &quot;A&quot; (for example, a group, a ring, a field, a lattice, etc.; or even a mere set without any operations), let Sub(&quot;A&quot;) be the set of all substructures of &quot;A&quot;, i.e., of all subsets of &quot;A&quot; which are closed under all operations of &quot;A&quot; (group addition, ring addition and multiplication, etc.). Here the notion of substructure includes the empty substructure in case the algebra &quot;A&quot; has no nullary operations.

Then:
* The set Sub(&quot;A&quot;), ordered by set inclusion, is a lattice. 
* The greatest element of Sub(&quot;A&quot;) is the set &quot;A&quot; itself. 
* For any &quot;S&quot;, &quot;T&quot; in Sub(&quot;A&quot;), the greatest lower bound of &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; is the set theoretic intersection of &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot;; the smallest upper bound is the subalgebra generated by the union of &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot;.
* The set Sub(&quot;A&quot;) is even a complete lattice. The greatest lower bound of any family of substructures is their intersection (or &quot;A&quot; if the family is empty). 
* The compact elements of Sub(&quot;A&quot;) are exactly the finitely generated substructures of &quot;A&quot;. 
* Every substructure is the union of its finitely generated substructures; hence Sub(&quot;A&quot;) is an algebraic lattice.

Also, a kind of converse holds: Every algebraic lattice is isomorphic to Sub(&quot;A&quot;) for some algebra &quot;A&quot;.

There is another algebraic lattice that plays an important role in universal algebra: For every algebra &quot;A&quot; 
we let Con(&quot;A&quot;) be the set of all congruence relations on &quot;A&quot;. Each congruence on &quot;A&quot; is a subalgebra of the product algebra &quot;A&quot;x&quot;A&quot;, so Con(&quot;A&quot;) ⊆ Sub(&quot;A&quot;x&quot;A&quot;). Again we have
* Con(&quot;A&quot;), ordered by set inclusion, is a lattice. 
* The greatest element of Con(&quot;A&quot;) is the set &quot;A&quot;x&quot;A&quot;, which is the congruence corresponding to the constant homomorphism. The smallest congruence is the diagonal of &quot;A&quot;x&quot;A&quot;, corresponding to isomorphisms.
* Con(&quot;A&quot;) is a complete lattice. 
* The compact elements of Con(&quot;A&quot;) are exactly the finitely generated congruences. 
* Con(&quot;A&quot;) is an algebraic lattice.

Again there is a converse: By a theorem of George Grätzer and E. T. Schmidt, every algebraic lattice is isomorphic to Con(&quot;A&quot;) for some algebra &quot;A&quot;.

== Applications ==

Compact elements are important in computer science in the semantic approach called domain theory, where they are considered as a kind of primitive element: the information represented by compact elements cannot be obtained by any approximation that does not already contain this knowledge. Compact elements cannot be approximated by elements strictly below them. On the other hand, it may happen that all non-compact elements can be obtained as directed suprema of compact elements. This is a desirable situation, since the set of compact elements is often smaller than the original poset—the examples above illustrate this.

<doc id="680264" wikidata="Q218883" url="?curid=680264" title="Urawa Red Diamonds">
<text>The , colloquially Urawa Reds (浦和レッズ, &quot;Urawa Rezzu&quot;), also known as Mitsubishi Urawa Football Club from April 1992 to January 1996, are a professional football club in the city of Saitama, part of the Greater Tokyo Area in Japan. The club plays in the J1 League, the top tier of football in the country. Its name comes from the former city of Urawa, now part of Saitama. It is one of the most successful clubs in the country, having won three AFC Champions League titles (most recently in 2022), and varied domestic titles, including a joint-record eight overall Emperor&#x27;s Cup titles. It participated three times at the FIFA Club World Cup.

The name &#x27;Red Diamonds&#x27; alludes to the club&#x27;s pre-professional era parent company Mitsubishi. The corporation&#x27;s logo consists of three red diamonds, one of which remains within the current club badge.

==History==
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries established a football club in 1950 in Kobe and moved the club to Tokyo in 1958. In 1965 it formed the Japan Soccer League (JSL) along with today&#x27;s JEF United Chiba, Kashiwa Reysol, Cerezo Osaka, Sanfrecce Hiroshima and three other clubs who have since been relegated to regional leagues (&quot;Original Eight&quot;).

Mitsubishi first won the JSL championship in 1969, as a break in Mazda/Sanfrecce&#x27;s dominance (and also with the fact that Toyo were in Bangkok, Thailand, competing in the Asian Club Cup); their runs up the first division were sporadic but steady until the 1980s when they fell into the Second Division. In 1990 they were promoted as JSL Division 2 champions, and thus were ready when the J-League implementation began in earnest. Urawa Red Diamonds was an original member (&quot;Original Ten&quot;) of the J.League in 1993.

=== Domestic treble ===
Mitsubishi were the first Japanese club to complete a domestic treble, when in 1978 they won the title, the Emperor&#x27;s Cup and the Japan Soccer League Cup.

==== Name changed ====
The club&#x27;s name was then changed to &quot;Mitsubishi Urawa Football Club&quot; from in April 1992 where their nickname was &quot;Red Diamonds&quot;. However, in February 1996, the club&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Urawa Red Diamonds&quot;.

The club has experienced varying degrees of success since the inception of the J-League. The team finished at the bottom of the league for the first two seasons, with an average attendance of fewer than 15,000. In 1999, they were relegated to the second tier of Japanese football once again., the club&#x27;s performance has improved in years, beginning with a victory in the 2003 Nabisco Cup.

In 2006, Urawa Reds clinched their first professional league title by defeating runners-up Gamba Osaka 3–2 on December 2 in front of 63,000 supporters. This after two close calls in the previous two years. In 2005, they finished second, just one point behind champions Gamba Osaka. In 2004, they finished third in the first stage and won the second stage and qualified for the two-match J.League Championship decider, they lost on penalty shootout to Yokohama F. Marinos.

=== Back to back cup champion ===
Urawa Reds were back to back Emperor&#x27;s Cup winners in 2005 and 2006. Winning the title for the first time since their establishment as a professional club, they defeated Shimizu S-Pulse 2–1 on 1 January 2006, and retained the title in 2007 with a 1–0 win over Gamba Osaka. This win also completed a league-cup double. In the 2007 tournament they were defeated at the first hurdle by J2 League outfit Ehime FC.

In 2007, despite a seemingly unassailable lead of seven points with four games remaining, Urawa Reds picked up only two points from their final four games. This run included losing at home to Kashima Antlers; the club who would leapfrog Urawa on the final day of the season to claim their fifth J.League title. Following their capitulation in the fourth round of the Emperor&#x27;s Cup to J2 League outfit Ehime FC, Urawa Reds had to be content with their 2007 AFC Champions League fixtures.

=== AFC Champions League winner ===

Urawa Reds recorded their first prestigious cup overcoming Iranian club Sepahan 3–1 on aggregate to clinch the 2007 AFC Champions League trophy. The victory made them the first Japanese side to win the cup since the competition was reorganised from the Asian Champions Cup in 2003. In the 2007 FIFA Club World Cup of the same year, Urawa Reds became the first AFC club to finish in third place, beating Tunisian side Étoile Sportive du Sahel on penalty shootout in the third/fourth place play off.

Throughout the 2008 AFC Champions League edition, Urawa Reds attempted to win their second consecutive AFC Champions League title and progressed to the semi-finals where they were defeated by fellow J-League rivals, and eventual Champions League winners, Gamba Osaka 3–1 on aggregate.

On 8 March 2014, a banner which read &quot;JAPANESE ONLY&quot; was hung at one of the entrances to the stands. As punishment for this racist behavior, the league match on 28 March was played behind closed doors.

In the 2017 AFC Champions League edition, Urawa Reds had a good run throughout the entire tournament which saw them face Saudi Arabia club, Al-Hilal in the final which saw Urawa Reds winning the 2017 AFC Champions League final 2–1 on aggregate to clinch their 2nd trophy.

Urawa Reds managed to make their way through all the way until the 2019 AFC Champions League final facing off against Al-Hilal once again. However, the club fell in a 3–0 aggregate loss to the Saudi Arabian club.

During the 2022 AFC Champions League, Urawa Reds had an easier run en route to the final where they faced three Southeast Asian club along the way, Singapore league champions Lion City Sailors in the group stage while they faced Malaysia league champions Johor Darul Ta&#x27;zim 5–0 in the Round of 16 and Thailand league champions BG Pathum United 4–0 in the Quarter-finals. Urawa Reds would then face Korea league champions, Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors in the semi-finals which ended up with Urawa Reds advancing to the final after winning the penalty shootout. The club faced their tournament rivals Al-Hilal for the third time in the 2022 AFC Champions League final. Urawa Red won 2–1 on aggregate, clinching their 3rd trophy.

On 19 September 2023, it was announced by JFA that Urawa Reds will not be participating in 2024 edition of Emperor&#x27;s Cup following supporters clash after 0–3 loss against Nagoya Grampus in the 4th round of 2023 edition.

== International affiliation ==
The club is also notable in that former Feyenoord midfielder Shinji Ono began his professional career playing for Urawa Reds. Ono returned for the 2006 season for a second stint with the club. Urawa Reds is affiliated with German club Bayern Munich, whose nickname is also &quot;The Reds&quot;. Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, the chairman of the Bayern Munich, announced that &quot;We have been looking for clubs which have potential ability, management stability and cordial confidence. We could fulfill the desire to affiliate with this great club, Urawa Reds.&quot; Some other foreign clubs, such as Arsenal, Club Atlético Independiente, CR Flamengo, VfB Stuttgart, Manchester United, Feyenoord, Hamburger SV and Perth Glory, visited Japan and played friendly games at the Saitama Stadium.

In August 2004, Urawa Reds appeared in a pre-season four-club friendly tournament, the Vodafone Cup, at Old Trafford, the home ground of Manchester United. Urawa Reds missed a few key players, losing their first match 5–2 against the Argentinian side Boca Juniors. The second fixture against the hosts, Manchester United, was called off due to a massive electric storm. Some 800 Urawa Reds fans had travelled to the game and were later compensated.

The club&#x27;s supporters also have an unofficial relationship with Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua. The clubs&#x27; supporters will support each other in continental competition. For example, Shenhua fans will support Urawa Reds when Urawa Reds plays in Shanghai against Shanghai SIPG.

==Home stadium==

Since the establishment of J.League in 1992, the club had used the Urawa Komaba Stadium as its home stadium. Due to the increasing popularity of the matches, Saitama City, owner of the stadium, expanded the seat capacity. During the renovation, the club used Ōmiya Park Soccer Stadium. In spite of the poor performance of the club, the stadium was filled with faithful supporters.

=== New home ground ===
In October 2001, Saitama Prefecture built new football-specific Saitama Stadium in Saitama city. This stadium was used as a venue for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. After the World Cup, the club gradually increased home games in Saitama Stadium and in 2003 the stadium was formally designated as the home stadium. In 2008, only two games were held at Komaba Stadium.

==Facilities==
Urawa Reds uses Ohara City Field for training. In addition to this facility, the club opened Redsland in 2005, which has three grass fields, one artificial turf field, one baseball field, futsal courts and tennis courts. Redsland is opened to the public and club members can use the facilities at relatively cheap fees.

== Mascots ==
The Red Diamonds have four mascots; Redia, Friendia, Schale, and Diarra. However, Redia doesn&#x27;t make much appearances at Saitama Stadium, due to the club&#x27;s policy of the stadium being a &quot;place for serious competition&quot;. When he does occasionally appear at the stadium, he does not participate in any fan activities. Because of this, Reds fans dubbed him as a NEET mascot (which is an acronym for &quot;No education, employment, or training&quot;). According to the club profile, Redia and Friendia were married during a Reds fan festival in 1997. The younger twin mascots, Schale and Diarra, were born on the day the Red Diamonds won their first J. League Championship in 2006.

==Rivalries==

=== Saitama derby ===

Urawa Red Diamonds has a local derby with Omiya Ardija, from Ōmiya-ku, Saitama city. They first met in the 1987 Emperor&#x27;s Cup, with Mitsubishi defeating NTT Kanto by 5 to 0 at Nishigaoka National Stadium. The derby first took place in the JSL Second Division in the 1989–90 season, and it wouldn&#x27;t take place until the 2000 season when Urawa was relegated to the second tier again. In 2003 the formerly separate Omiya and Urawa cities merged to become Saitama city, and since 2005 the derby became a top flight fixture after Omiya was promoted.

=== Marunouchi Gosanke ===
During the JSL years and into the 1990s, Urawa&#x27;s main top flight rivals were JEF United Chiba and Kashiwa Reysol, both now based in Chiba Prefecture. Because of their former parent companies&#x27; headquarters being all based in Marunouchi, Tokyo, the three clubs were known as the &quot;Marunouchi Gosanke&quot; (丸の内御三家, &quot;Marunouchi Big Three&quot;) and fixtures among them were known as the &quot;Marunouchi derbies&quot;, although the term is falling out of use as they are now based in different prefectures and rarely play home games in Tokyo stadiums.

=== Others ===
Rivals further afield include Kashima Antlers, FC Tokyo, Yokohama Marinos, Kawasaki Frontale, and, even farther away, Gamba Osaka. Old JSL championship rivalries with Sanfrecce Hiroshima, Cerezo Osaka and Shonan Bellmare have ebbed down as those clubs had nadirs in the second tier.

== Women&#x27;s team ==
The club also has a women&#x27;s football team, currently playing in the WE League as Urawa Red Diamonds Ladies.

==Kit and colours==
===Colours===

<text>Steve Davis (born April 14, 1967) is an American jazz trombonist.

==Early life and education==
Born in Worcester, Massachusetts, Davis was raised in Binghamton, New York. He grew up with jazz music being played in his household. He studied jazz under Jackie McLean at the University of Hartford Hartt School. 

== Career ==
McLean recommended Davis to Art Blakey, and he joined The Jazz Messengers in 1989. After Blakey&#x27;s death, Davis joined the Hartt faculty in the early 1990s.

Davis played in Chick Corea&#x27;s Origin, and recorded with them in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Davis has been a member of the sextet One for All since its inception around 1996. Along with Davis, the band features Eric Alexander, Jim Rotondi, David Hazeltine, John Webber and Joe Farnsworth. Davis led his own bands in New York City in the mid-2000s.

<text>The Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) is a species of tuna in the family Scombridae. It is variously known as the northern bluefin tuna (mainly when including Pacific bluefin as a subspecies), giant bluefin tuna (for individuals exceeding ), and formerly as the tunny.

Atlantic bluefins are native to both the western and eastern Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Mediterranean Sea. They have become regionally extinct in the Black Sea. The Atlantic bluefin tuna is a close relative of one of the other two bluefin tuna species, the Pacific bluefin tuna. The southern bluefin tuna, on the other hand, is more closely related to other tuna species such as yellowfin tuna and bigeye tuna, and the similarities between the southern and northern species are due to convergent evolution.

Atlantic bluefin tuna have been recorded at up to in weight, and rival the black marlin, blue marlin, and swordfish as the largest Perciformes. Throughout recorded history, the Atlantic bluefin tuna has been highly prized as a food fish. Besides their commercial value as food, the great size, speed, and power they display as predators has attracted the admiration of fishermen, writers, and scientists.

The Atlantic bluefin tuna has been the foundation of one of the world&#x27;s most lucrative commercial fisheries. Medium-sized and large individuals are heavily targeted for the Japanese raw-fish market, where all bluefin species are highly prized for sushi and sashimi.

This commercial importance has led to severe overfishing. The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas affirmed in October 2009 that Atlantic bluefin tuna stocks had declined dramatically over the last 40 years, by 72% in the Eastern Atlantic, and by 82% in the Western Atlantic. On 16 October 2009, Monaco formally recommended endangered Atlantic bluefin tuna for an Appendix I CITES listing and international trade ban. In early 2010, European officials, led by the French ecology minister, increased pressure to ban the commercial fishing of bluefin tuna internationally. However, a UN proposal to protect the species from international trade was voted down (68 against, 20 for, 30 abstaining). Since then, enforcement of regional fishing quotas has led to some increases in population. the Atlantic bluefin tuna was moved from the category of Endangered to the category of Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. However, many regional populations are still severely depleted, including western stocks which spawn in the Gulf of Mexico.

Most bluefins are captured commercially by professional fishermen using longlines, purse seines, assorted hook-and-line gear, heavy rods and reels, and harpoons. Recreationally, bluefins have been one of the most important big-game species sought by sports fishermen since the 1930s, particularly in the United States, but also in Canada, Spain, France, England, and Italy.

==Taxonomy==
The Atlantic bluefin tuna was one of the many fish species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, where it was given the binomial name &quot;Scomber thynnus&quot;.

It is most closely related to the Pacific bluefin tuna (&quot;T. orientalis&quot;) , and more distantly to the other large tunas of the genus &quot;Thunnus&quot; – the southern bluefin tuna (&quot;T. maccoyii&quot;), the bigeye tuna (&quot;T. obesus&quot;) and the yellowfin tuna (&quot;T. albacares&quot;). The southern bluefin tuna was traditionally considered the closest relatives of the two northern species, but a recent study has suggested that the morphological similarities are the result of convergent evolution, and many are adaptations for cold water habitats. For many years, the Pacific and Atlantic bluefin tuna species were considered to be the same, or subspecies, and referred to as the &quot;northern bluefin tuna&quot;. This name occasionally gives rise to some confusion, as the longtail tuna (&quot;T. tonggol&quot;) can in Australia sometimes be known under the name &quot;northern bluefin tuna&quot;. This is also true in New Zealand and Fiji.

Bluefin tuna were often referred to as the common tunny, especially in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand. The name &quot;tuna&quot;, a derivative of the Spanish &quot;atún&quot;, was widely adopted in California in the early 1900s, and has since become accepted for all tunas, including the bluefin, throughout the English-speaking world. In some languages, the red color of the bluefin&#x27;s meat is included in its name, as in &quot;atún rojo&quot; (Spanish) and &quot;tonno rosso&quot; (Italian), amongst others.

==Description==

The body of the Atlantic bluefin tuna is rhomboidal in profile and robust. The head is conical and the mouth rather large. The head contains a &quot;pineal window&quot; that allows the fish to navigate over its multiple thousands-of-miles range. Their color is dark blue above and gray below, with a gold coruscation covering the body and bright yellow caudal finlets. Bluefin tuna can be distinguished from other family members by the relatively short length of their pectoral fins. Their livers have a unique characteristic in that they are covered with blood vessels (striated). In other tunas with short pectoral fins, such vessels are either not present or present in small numbers along the edges.

Fully mature adult specimens average long and weigh around . The largest recorded specimen taken under International Game Fish Association rules was caught off Nova Scotia, an area renowned for huge Atlantic bluefin, and weighed and was long.The longest contest between man and tuna fish occurred near Liverpool, Nova Scotia in 1934, when six men taking turns fought a tuna for 62 hours. Both the Smithsonian Institution and the U. S. National Marine Fisheries Service have accepted that this species can weigh up to , though further details are lacking. Atlantic bluefin tuna reach maturity relatively quickly. In a survey that included specimens up to in length and in weight, none was believed to be older than 15 years. However, very large specimens may be up to 50 years old.

The bluefin possesses enormous muscular strength, which it channels through a pair of tendons to its lunate-shaped caudal fin for propulsion. In contrast to many other fish, the body stays rigid while the tail flicks back and forth, increasing stroke efficiency. It also has a very efficient circulatory system. It possesses one of the highest blood-hemoglobin concentrations among fish, which allows it to efficiently deliver oxygen to its tissues; this is combined with an exceptionally thin blood-water barrier to ensure rapid oxygen uptake.
To keep its core muscles warm, which are used for power and steady swimming, the Atlantic bluefin uses countercurrent exchange to prevent heat from being lost to the surrounding water. Heat in the venous blood is efficiently transferred to the cool, oxygenated arterial blood entering a rete mirabile. While all members of the tuna family are warm-blooded, the ability to thermoregulate is more highly developed in bluefin tuna than in any other fish. This allows them to seek food in the rich but chilly waters of the North Atlantic.

==Biology and ecology==
Bluefins dive to depths of . The Atlantic bluefin tuna typically hunts small fish such as sardines, herring, mackerel, and eels, and invertebrates such as squid and crustaceans. They exhibit opportunistic hunting in schools of fish organized by size. Their white skeletal muscle allows for large contractions which aids burst swimming to ensure prey capture.

The species is host to over 70 parasites although none have been yet described as causing harm to the species. The tetraphyllidean tapeworm &quot;Pelichnibothrium speciosum&quot; is one parasite of the species. As the tapeworm&#x27;s definite host is the blue shark, which does not generally seem to feed on tuna, the Atlantic bluefin tuna likely is a dead-end host for &quot;P. speciosum&quot;.

Atlantic bluefin tuna are eaten by a wide variety of predators. When they are newly hatched, they are eaten by other fishes that specialize on eating plankton. At that life stage, their numbers are reduced dramatically. Those that survive face a steady increase in the size of their predators. Adult Atlantic Bluefin are not eaten by anything other than the very largest billfishes, toothed whales, and some open ocean shark species.

===Life history===

Bluefin tuna are oviparous, congregating together in large groups to spawn. Over several days, a female releases large numbers of eggs into the water where they are fertilized externally by male sperm. Female bluefins have been estimated to produce a mean of 128.5 eggs per gram of body weight, or up to 40 million eggs at a time. Eggs hatch into larvae two days after fertilization and become cannibalistic quarter-inch long fish by the end of a week. About 40% of larvae survive their first week, and about 0.1% the first year. Surviving bluefin tend to group together in schools according to size.

Atlantic bluefin tuna were traditionally known to spawn in two widely separated areas. Pop-up satellite tracking results generally confirm the belief held by many scientists and fishermen that although bluefin that were spawned in each area may forage widely across the Atlantic, the vast majority return to their natal area to spawn. 
The spawning ground of the eastern stock of Atlantic bluefin is in the western Mediterranean, particularly in the area of the Balearic Islands. The spawning ground of the western stock is in the Gulf of Mexico. Because Atlantic bluefins group together in large concentrations to spawn, they are highly vulnerable to commercial fishing while spawning. This is particularly so in the Mediterranean, where the groups of spawning bluefins can be spotted from the air by light aircraft and purse seines directed to set around the schools.

In 2016, researchers suggested that a third spawning area exists in the Slope Sea, an area to the north and west of the Northeastern United States Continental Shelf. Subsequent research indicates that comparable concentrations of bluefin larvae are found in the Slope Sea and in the Gulf of Mexico.

A number of behavioral differences have been observed between the eastern and western populations, some of which may reflect environmental conditions. For example, bluefin in the Gulf of Mexico spawn between mid-April and mid-June, when the surface water temperature is between and , while bluefin in the Mediterranean spawn between June and August, when water is between and . In the Gulf of Mexico bluefin appear to correct for higher surface temperatures by diving, going deeper than when entering the Gulf and staying deeper than to spawn.

The western and eastern populations have been thought to mature at different ages. Bluefins born in the east are thought to reach maturity a year or two earlier than those spawned in the west. It has also been suggested that these apparent differences may reflect not-well-understood complexities of migration patterns and additional spawning areas such as the Slope Sea.

==Human interaction==
===Ancient fishery===
According to Longo, &quot;by the turn of the first millennium CE, a sophisticated bluefin tuna trap fishery [had] emerged. ... This trap fishery, called tonnara in Italian, madrague in French, almadraba in Spanish, and armação in Portuguese, forms an elaborate maze of nets that capture and corral bluefin tuna during their spawning season. Active for more than a thousand years, the traditional/artisanal bluefin tuna trap fishery has experienced a collapse in the Mediterranean and has struggled where it is still practiced.&quot;

===Commercial fishery===
After World War II, Japanese fishermen wanted more tuna to eat and to export for European and U.S. canning industries. They expanded their fishing range and perfected industrial long-line fishing, a practice that employs thousands of baited hooks on lines several kilometers long. In the 1970s, Japanese manufacturers developed lightweight, high-strength polymers that were spun into drift net. Though they were banned on the high seas by the early 1990s, in the 1970s, hundreds of kilometers of them were often deployed in a single night. At-sea freezing technology then allowed them to bring frozen sushi-ready tuna from the farthest oceans to market after as long as a year.

The initial target was yellowfin tuna. Japanese did not value bluefin before the 1960s. By the late 1960s, sportfishing for giant bluefin tuna was burgeoning off Nova Scotia, New England, and Long Island. North Americans, too, had little appetite for bluefins, usually discarding them after taking a picture. The bluefin sport fishing rise, however, coincided with Japan&#x27;s export boom. In the 1960s and &#x27;70s, cargo planes were returning to Japan empty. A Japanese entrepreneur realized he could buy New England and Canadian bluefins cheaply, and started filling Japan-bound holds with tuna. Exposure to beef and other fatty meats during the U.S. occupation following World War Two had prepared the Japanese palate for bluefin&#x27;s fatty belly (&quot;otoro&quot;). The Atlantic bluefin was the biggest and the favorite. The appreciation rebounded across the Pacific when Americans started to eat raw fish in the late 1970s.

Prior to the 1960s, Atlantic bluefin fisheries were relatively small scale, and populations remained stable. Although some local stocks, such as those in the North Sea, were damaged by unrestricted commercial fishing, other populations were not at risk. However, in the 1960s, purse seiners catching fish for the canned tuna market in United States coastal waters removed huge numbers of juvenile and young Western Atlantic bluefins, taking out several entire-year classes. Mediterranean fisheries have historically been poorly regulated and catches under-reported, with French, Spanish, and Italian fishermen competing with North African nations for a diminishing population. The migratory habits of tuna complicate the task of regulating the fishery, because they spend time in the national waters of multiple countries, as well as the open ocean outside of any national jurisdiction.

===Aquaculture===
Tuna ranching began as early as the 1970s. Canadian fishermen in St Mary&#x27;s Bay captured young fish and raised them in pens. In captivity, they grow to reach hundreds of kilos, eventually fetching premium prices in Japan. Ranching enables ranchers to exploit the unpredictable supply of wild-caught fish. Ranches across the Mediterranean and off South Australia grow bluefins offshore. According to OECD statistics, 35 thousand tons have been produced in 2018 with Japan accounting for about 50% of it, followed by Australia, Mexico, Spain and Turkey with smaller amounts. Large proportions of juvenile and young Mediterranean fish are taken to be grown on tuna farms. Because the tuna are taken from the wild to the pens before they are old enough to reproduce, ranching is one of the most serious threats to the species. The slow growth and late sexual maturity of bluefin tuna compound its problems. The Atlantic population has declined by nearly 90% since the 1970s.

In Europe and Australia, scientists have used light-manipulation technology and time-release hormone implants to bring about the first large-scale captive spawning of Atlantic and southern bluefins. The technology involves implanting gonadotropin-releasing hormone in the fish to stimulate fertile egg production and may push the fish to reach sexual maturity at younger ages.

However, since bluefins require so much food per unit of weight gained, up to 10 times that of salmon, if bluefins were to be farmed at the same scale as 21st-century salmon farming, many of their prey species might become depleted if farmed bluefin were fed the same diet as their wild counterparts. As of 2010, 30 million tonnes of small forage fish were removed from the oceans yearly, the majority to feed farmed fish.

Market entry by many North African Mediterranean countries, such as Tunisia and Libya in the 1990s, along with the increasingly widespread practice of tuna farming in the Mediterranean and other areas, such as southern Australia (for southern bluefin tuna), depressed prices. One result is that fishermen must now catch up to twice as many fish to maintain their revenues.
The Atlantic bluefin is endangered.

===Threats===
Global appetite for fish is the predominant threat to Atlantic bluefin. Overfishing continues despite repeated warnings of the current precipitous decline. Bluefin aquaculture, which arose in response to declining wild stocks, has yet to achieve a sustainability, in part because it predominantly relies on harvesting and ranching juveniles rather than captive breeding.

The 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill released an estimated 4.9 million barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico during the spawning season of the Atlantic bluefin tuna. The oil is estimated to have affected roughly 3.1 million square miles, including more than 5 percent of the tuna habitat in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. The spill occurred at a peak time for the fertilization of eggs and the development of larval bluefin tuna. Resulting short and long-term impacts on populations of Atlantic bluefin tuna and other pelagic species are difficult to determine, in part due to limitations in monitoring ability.

Nonetheless, a number of lethal and sublethal impacts have been documented, including pericardial edema, defective cardiac function and cardiac abnormalities.

===Conservation===
====Fisheries management organizations====
In 2007, researchers from the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) — the regulators of Atlantic bluefin fishing—recommended a global quota of 15,000 tonnes to maintain current stocks or 10,000 tonnes to allow the fisheries recovery. ICCAT then chose a quota of 36,000 tonnes, but surveys indicated that up to 60,000 tonnes were actually being taken (a third of the total remaining stocks) and the limit was reduced to 22,500 tonnes. Their scientists now say that 7,500 tonnes are the sustainable limit. In November 2009, ICCAT set the 2010 quota at 13,500 tonnes and said that if stocks were not rebuilt by 2022, it would consider closing some areas.

On 18 March 2010, the United Nations rejected a U.S.-backed effort to impose a total ban on Atlantic bluefin tuna fishing and trading. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) vote was 68 to 20 with 30 European abstentions. The leading opponent, Japan, claimed that ICCAT was the proper regulatory body.

In 2011, the USA&#x27;s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) decided not to list the Atlantic bluefin tuna as an endangered species. NOAA officials said that the more stringent international fishing rules created in November 2010 would be enough for the Atlantic bluefin tuna to recover. NOAA agreed to reconsider the species&#x27; endangered status in 2013. It was made a National Marine Fisheries Service species of concern, one of those species about which the U.S. government has some concerns regarding status and threats, but for which insufficient information is available to indicate a need to list the species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.

In November 2012, 48 countries meeting in Morocco for the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas voted to keep strict fishing limits, saying the species&#x27; population is still fragile. The quota will rise only slightly, from 12,900 metric tons a year to 13,500. The decision was reviewed in November 2014, resulting in higher allowances listed below.

The latest stock assessment for Atlantic bluefin tuna reflected an improvement in the status for both western and eastern Atlantic/Mediterranean stocks. The Commission adopted new management measures that are within the range of scientific advice, are consistent with the respective rebuilding plans, and allow for continued stock growth. For the western stock, the TAC of 2,000 mt annually for 2015 and 2016 will provide for continued growth in spawning stock biomass and allow the strong 2003 year-class to continue to enhance the productivity of the stock. The TAC for the eastern Atlantic/Mediterranean stock was set at 16,142 t for 2015; 19,296 t for 2016; and 23,155 t for 2017.

In 2020, the UK government recognized the increasing incidence of bluefin tuna in UK waters in recent years and is funding ongoing research to understand the ecology of the species and devise an approach to its management.

====Other organizations====
In 2010, Greenpeace International added the northern bluefin tuna to its seafood red list. As of January 2022, the bluefin tuna remains on the list.

In the summer of 2011, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society led a campaign against supposedly illegal bluefin tuna fishing off the coast of Libya, which was under Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s regime at the time. The fishermen retaliated against Sea Shepherd&#x27;s intervention by throwing various small metal pieces at the crew. Nobody was injured due to the other side&#x27;s actions during the conflict.

In November 2011, food critic Eric Asimov of &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized the top-ranked New York City restaurant Sushi Yasuda for offering bluefin tuna on their menu, arguing that drawing from such a threatened fishery constituted an unjustifiable risk to bluefins, and to the future of culinary traditions that depend on the species.

The bluefin species are listed by the Monterey Bay Aquarium on its Seafood Watch list and pocket guides as fish to avoid due to overfishing.

===Cuisine===

Atlantic bluefin tuna is one of the most highly prized fish used in Japanese raw fish dishes. About 80% of the caught Atlantic and Pacific bluefin tunas are consumed in Japan. Bluefin tuna sashimi is a particular delicacy in Japan. For example, an Atlantic bluefin caught off eastern United States sold for US$247,000 at the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo in 2008. This high price is considerably less than the highest prices paid for Pacific bluefin. Prices were highest in the late 1970s and 1980s.

Japanese began eating tuna sushi in the 1840s, when a large catch came into Edo [old Tokyo] one season. A chef marinated a few pieces in soy sauce and served it as &quot;nigiri sushi&quot;. At that time, these fish were nicknamed&quot; shibi&quot; — &quot;four days&quot; — because chefs would bury them for four days to mellow their bloody taste.

By the 1930s, tuna sushi was commonplace in Japan.

<text>BBC East Midlands Today is the BBC&#x27;s regional television news programme for the East Midlands.

The programme is broadcast on BBC One from studios at the BBC&#x27;s East Midlands broadcasting centre in Nottingham with district newsrooms based in Derby and Leicester. The main transmitter for the programme is Waltham near Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire.

The programme can be watched in any part of the UK (and Europe) from Astra 1N on Freesat channel 952 and Sky channel 960. The latest edition of &quot;BBC East Midlands Today&quot; is also available to watch on the BBC iPlayer.

==History==
===Background===
The first BBC Home Service broadcasting site in Nottingham was from the third floor of the Bentinck Buildings in Wheelergate from 18 August 1950. The broadcasts went via the Nottingham telephone exchange to the BBC site in Birmingham on telephone trunk lines. The first live broadcast was on 2 December 1950 by George Liddell, of Nottingham Forest against Exeter. Both Nottingham and Leicester had around 8,000 television sets. Also earlier in 1950, Nottingham&#x27;s Ken Adam had become Controller of the Light Programme (BBC Radio 2 from 1967). 

One of the first live TV broadcasts from the area came on 7 June 1951 with cricket matches being sent to Sutton Coldfield, via a TV relay station on Bardon Hill in Leicestershire. A BBC national broadcasting site at nearby Lincoln opened on 8 March 1951.

The Director General of the BBC, Sir Ian Jacob first visited the new Nottingham site on 12 June 1953, having lunch with the Senate of University of Nottingham.

The controller of the BBC Midland region was John Dunkerley CBE (10 October 1902 – 21 March 1985), who had been there since 1932, working with composer Victor Hely-Hutchinson; Dunkerley was replaced in August 1964 by Patrick Beech CBE, of Malvern, the assistant head of the BBC West region. Beech was the grandson of Mrs Patrick Campbell, whose second husband had been, previously, the second husband (from 1900) of Winston Churchill&#x27;s mother. In 1969 Beech became the Controller of English Regions. In 1970 the structure of BBC TV regions changed.

===Earlier sites===
The £17,000 Derby Road site was opened by the Lord Mayor of Nottingham on Tuesday 1 October 1963. It had two sound studios. The studio on Derby Road was next to the catholic St Barnabas Cathedral. The site was directed by Gerald Nethercot, of Somerset. Mr Nethercot had worked for Leicester City Council from 1938. He was Emergency Information Officer for Leicester during the war, and a 2nd Lt in the Home Guard. He joined the RAF in 1943 as a Flt Lt, working in reconnaissance of V-weapon sites in the Pas de Calais, joining the BBC Midland region in January 1947. He was the first official BBC East Midlands staff, being appointed in November 1950. There was a press report that he never let his own children watch any evening television, and his children could watch children&#x27;s television only twice a week. His son Patrick, born in 1946, flatly denies this and remembers watching much television through the 1950s. The local BBC news programme was called &#x27;Midlands Six-Ten&#x27;.

The building was designed by Bartlett &amp; Gray, and built by Sweeney &amp; Palmer Ltd of Beechdale Road; structural steelwork was done by Siddons of Redhill. The building was named after Robert Willson (bishop) who was responsible for the cathedral being there, and built by the Catholic diocese, costing £50,000. The BBC were on the second floor. There were plans for a new larger broadcasting centre in Birmingham, which opened in 1971. New colour television transmitters for Nottinghamshire and Northamptonshire were planned for 1966. By the end of 1966 it was hoped that two-thirds of the UK could receive BBC2.

On Monday 13 December 1976 colour news first came from the Derby Road studio on Holden Street. It had been black and white since 1963. The East Midlands correspondent was Bruce Myles, of Ravenshead. The transmitter was on the top of Nottingham Technical College. Philip Tibenham and Chris Drake had worked at the early Derby Road site.

From Monday 7 to Friday 11 September 1981, &quot;Midlands Today&quot; was broadcast entirely from the Nottingham studio on Derby Road, next to the catholic Cathedral.

The first East Midlands short TV news bulletins began on Monday 3 October 1983, with Graham Henshaw. &quot;Central News East&quot; began its news programmes around the same time, after a 21-month industrial dispute had finished. Later in 1987, Graham Henshaw became the editor of &quot;Look East&quot;, in Norwich.

From Monday 3 October 1983, the East Midlands had half-hourly bulletins on Breakfast News. On Monday 15 July 1985 the main East Midlands opt out of &quot;Midlands Today&quot; started, with presenters 26-year-old Julie Hall from Marple, who joined in October 1983 from Channel 4, and 38-year-old Brian Conway, of Radio Leicester, from Hathern. In October 1988 Conway married BBC Birmingham presenter Kay Alexander. Julie, with a degree in Industrial Relations, soon returned to Channel 4 to present the &#x27;Union World&#x27; documentary series&#x27;

Tom Beesley, educated at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys, the station manager from 1973 to 79 of Radio Nottingham had been the Midland regional television manager since August 1982, and lived in Kinoulton, and knew the Nottingham area, being born in Leicester. It was 6 minutes, to become 10 minutes in six months, once technology allowed this. Introducing the new opt out had cost £75,000. New editing facilities were built at a site on Derby Road, where staff increased from 2 to 18. 75% of the news for the opt out came from local radio. Tom Beesley, with another former BBC Midlands regional manager David Waine (regional head at Birmingham from June 1983 to September 1994, being replaced by Nigel Chapman), would also start the new regional Radio 106 in September 1997.

In 1992 Janet Mayo voiced the announcements on the London Underground Central Line; the 85 trains were built by BREL in Derby.

===Establishment===
There had been plans for a separate region from 1969, in the BBC report &#x27;Broadcasting in the 70s&#x27;.

To prepare for the new region, a new studio was built on Mansfield Road, opened by 53-year-old Michael Checkland on 27 June 1989. The building was later demolished, around 2017.

&quot;BBC East Midlands Today&quot; was established as an independent programme on 7 January 1991, having previously been a part of &quot;Midlands Today&quot;, which now solely covers the West Midlands region.

The split arose from criticisms of &quot;Midlands Today&quot; as being too centric on West Midlands coverage, although a service of separate opt-out bulletins for the region had been provided during the 1980s.

On 5 February 1996, the show introduced a double-anchored presentation with Quentin Rayner and Kathy Rochford. The programme&#x27;s newer (generic) &#x27;look&#x27;, in line with most other BBC regional TV news programmes, was introduced on 16 September 2002, with an update on 6 September 2004. The current titles and graphics were introduced in July 2019.

==Coverage area==
Parts of the Government-defined East Midlands region receive different regional programmes rather than &quot;East Midlands Today&quot;. 

North Nottinghamshire (Bassetlaw), northeast Derbyshire (Chesterfield), the eastern High Peak (Hope Valley) and northern area of the Derbyshire Dales (Tideswell and Hathersage) are covered by &quot;Look North&quot; broadcasting from Leeds. 

The western area of the High Peak (Buxton, Glossop, New Mills and Chapel-en-le-Frith), in Derbyshire are covered by &quot;North West Tonight&quot;.

All of Northamptonshire is covered by &quot;Look East &quot; and some southwestern parts of the county covered by &quot;South Today&quot;.

In most of Lincolnshire, BBC regional news is supplied by &quot;Look North East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire&quot;, broadcast from Hull. &quot;East Midlands Today&quot; still covers South Kesteven. Some viewers (but not all) in Lincoln have their aerials point to the Waltham transmitter that broadcast &quot;East Midlands Today&quot;, however the city is mostly covered by &quot;Look North&quot;, with most of Lincoln&#x27;s television signals being received from the Belmont transmitter.

Some areas that are well covered by &quot;East Midlands Today&quot; receive better television signals from other transmitters rather the Waltham transmitter on Freeview. Mansfield, Ashfield and Bolsover areas receive better television signals from either the Emley Moor or Belmont transmitters, Market Harborough get stronger signals from the Sandy Heath transmitter and most of North West Leicestershire and Swadlincote receive better signals from the Sutton Coldfield transmitter.

However, those areas are given &quot;East Midlands Today&quot; on Channel 101 through satellite television such as Freesat as default via the towns&#x27; postcodes.

<doc id="680272" wikidata="Q1051999" url="?curid=680272" title="From a Buick 8">
<text>From a Buick 8 is a horror novel by American writer Stephen King. Published on September 24, 2002, this is the second novel by King to feature a supernatural car (the first one being &quot;Christine&quot; which, like this novel, is set in Western Pennsylvania). According to the book&#x27;s cover sleeve&#x27;s inside front flap: &quot;&quot;From a Buick 8&quot; is a novel about our fascination with deadly things, about our insistence on answers when there are none, about terror and courage in the face of the unknowable.&quot; The title comes from Bob Dylan&#x27;s song &quot;From a Buick 6&quot;.

==Plot==
The novel is a series of recollections by the members of Troop D, a Pennsylvania State Police barracks in Western Pennsylvania. After a drunk driver kills Curtis Wilcox, a well-liked member of Troop D, his son Ned begins to visit the barracks. The cops, the dispatcher and the custodian quickly take a liking to the boy. Eventually, the troopers begin telling Ned about the &quot;Buick 8&quot;.

The Buick 8, which resembles a vintage blue 1953 Buick Roadmaster, has been in storage in a shed near the barracks since 1979, when it was left at a gas station by a mysterious driver who then disappeared without a trace. The car, they discover, is not a car at all. Although it appears to be a Buick Roadmaster, the steering wheel is immobile, the dashboard instruments are useless props, the engine has no moving parts, the ignition wires go nowhere, there are four portholes on the passenger side and only three on the driver side, the car heals itself when damaged and it repels all dirt or debris.

Sandy Dearborn, now Sergeant Commanding of Troop D, is the main narrator of the book, and tells the story to Ned, discussing various things that have happened with the car and his father&#x27;s fascination with it. The car will frequently give off what they dub &quot;lightquakes&quot;, or large flashes of purple light over an extended period of time. These lights will occasionally &quot;give birth&quot; to strange plants and creatures that are not like anything in our world. Two people have disappeared in the vicinity of the car — Wilcox&#x27;s former partner Ennis Rafferty, as well as an escaped lowlife named Brian Lippy. It is later suggested that perhaps the Buick was actually a portal between our world and another.

After hearing the story of the Buick and how it has been kept secret by Troop D for so long, Ned becomes convinced that the car was somehow related to the death of his father, as the drunk driver who killed him was the gas station attendant who first reported the Buick in 1979. Sandy cautions him to keep from obsessing over the Buick (&quot;There are Buicks everywhere&quot;, he later warns), but after leaving Ned at the Troop D barracks to eat at a diner, he realizes that Ned never asked whether anyone considered destroying it. He deduces that Ned is determined to destroy the Buick, and that the Buick wants to use that impulse to take Ned into the other world.

Sandy returns to the shed to find Ned sitting in the Buick, Ned having poured gasoline underneath while holding a pistol and a match. Just as Sandy pulls Ned out, the Buick transforms into a portal, trying to draw both Ned and Sandy inside of it. The rest of the staff arrive on the feeling that something bad may happen, all of them helping recall the story of the Buick&#x27;s origin. They manage to pull Ned and Sandy free, but not before Sandy glimpses into the world on the other side of the Buick; he sees Lippy&#x27;s swastika necklace and cowboy boots, along with Ennis&#x27;s Stetson hat and Ruger revolver.

One last story is told, revealing that destroying the Buick actually was discussed. However, they come to theorize that the Buick functions as a sort of regulator valve between the worlds, and that destroying it would do more harm than good. They decide that it is safest to watch over the Buick, in the hope that whatever supernatural force it possesses will eventually dissipate and expire.

Eddie Jacubois, one of the troopers, ends up killing himself and Ned becomes a State Trooper. One day, Ned shows Sandy the Buick; there is now a crack in the windshield that hasn&#x27;t healed. They realize that whatever was sustaining the Buick is spent, and that sooner or later it will eventually fall apart by itself.

==Adaptation==
*Chesapeake Films announced in 2005 that George A. Romero would direct a motion picture adaptation of &quot;From a Buick 8&quot;. The script was written by Johnathon Schaech and Richard Chizmar. 
*In 2007 Tobe Hooper replaced Romero, but production stalled in 2009 due to problems obtaining financing. 
*A different adaptation is in development with William Brent Bell as director and writer.
*In December 2019, Thomas Jane announced that together with producer Courtney Lauren Penn (Altitude) he will be teaming up to form LA-based content company Renegade Entertainment for the adaptation of this movie. On an August 2020 episode of &quot;The Kingcast&quot; podcast, Thomas Jane said that Jim Mickle has signed on to direct.

<text>Highway 22 is a north–south provincial highway in British Columbia that connects the city of Castlegar to the Canada–U.S. border. When the highway was first opened in 1964, it only went as far north from the border as Rossland. Highways 3 and 3B followed the present-day routing of Highway 22 north of Rossland at the time Highway 22 was first opened. The route north of Rossland was given to Highway 22 in 1979. The number of the highway is derived from then-Washington State Route 22 (renumbered to Route 25 in 1964), which Highway 22 meets at the border.

==Route details==
The total distance covered by Highway 22 is . It begins at the Canada-U.S. border at a location known as Paterson. From Paterson, Highway 22 goes north for to Rossland, where it meets Highway 3B. Highway 3B then carries Highway 22 east for to Trail where Highway 3B diverges east. Highway 22 then follows the Columbia River north for to where it meets the Crowsnest Highway at Castlegar.

<doc id="680285" wikidata="Q1475447" url="?curid=680285" title="Futex">
<text>In computing, a futex (short for &quot;fast userspace mutex&quot;) is a kernel system call that programmers can use to implement basic locking, or as a building block for higher-level locking abstractions such as semaphores and POSIX mutexes or condition variables.

A futex consists of a kernel-space &quot;wait queue&quot; that is attached to an atomic integer in userspace. Multiple processes or threads operate on the integer entirely in userspace (using atomic operations to avoid interfering with one another), and only resort to relatively expensive system calls to request operations on the wait queue (for example to wake up waiting processes, or to put the current process on the wait queue). A properly programmed futex-based lock will not use system calls except when the lock has contention; since most operations do not require arbitration between processes, this will not happen in most cases.

== History ==
Hubertus Franke (IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center), Matthew Kirkwood, Ingo Molnár (Red Hat), and Rusty Russell (IBM Linux Technology Center) originated the futex mechanism on Linux in 2002.
 In the same year, discussions took place on a proposal to make futexes accessible via the file system by creating a special node in codice_1 or codice_2. However, Linus Torvalds strongly opposed this idea and rejected any related patches.

Futexes then appeared for the first time in version 2.5.7 of the Linux kernel development series; the semantics stabilized as of version 2.5.40, and futexes have been part of the Linux kernel mainline since the December 2003 release of 2.6.x stable kernel series.

Futex functionality has been implemented in Microsoft Windows since Windows 8 or Windows Server 2012 under the name WaitOnAddress.

In 2013, Microsoft patented futex-related WaitOnAddress and the patent was granted in 2014.
In May 2014, the CVE system announced a vulnerability discovered in the Linux kernel&#x27;s futex subsystem that allowed denial-of-service attacks or local privilege escalation.

In May 2015, the Linux kernel introduced a deadlock bug via Commit b0c29f79ecea that caused a hang in user applications. The bug affected many enterprise Linux distributions, including 3.x and 4.x kernels, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 5, 6 and 7, SUSE Linux 12 and Amazon Linux.

Futexes have been implemented in OpenBSD since 2016.

The futex mechanism is one of the core concepts of the Zircon kernel in Google&#x27;s Fuchsia operating system since at least April 2018.

Apple implemented futex in iOS/iPadOS/tvOS 17.4, macOS 14.4, watchOS 10.4 and visionOS 1.1.

== Operations ==
Futexes have two basic operations, codice_3 and codice_4.

* codice_5
: If the value stored at the address codice_6 is codice_7, puts the current thread to sleep.
* codice_8
: Wakes up codice_9 number of threads waiting on the address codice_6.

For more advanced uses, there are a number of other operations, the most used being codice_11 and codice_12, which both function as more generic codice_4 operations.

* codice_14
: If the value stored at the address codice_15 is codice_7, wakes codice_17 threads waiting on the address codice_15, and enqueues codice_19 threads waiting on the address codice_15 to now wait on the address codice_21. This can be used to avoid the thundering herd problem on wake.
* codice_22
: Will read codice_23, perform codice_24 with codice_25 on it, and store the result back to codice_23. Then it will wake codice_27 threads waiting on codice_28, and, if the previously read value from codice_23 matches codice_30 using comparison codice_31, will wake codice_32 threads waiting on codice_23. This very flexible and generic wake mechanism is useful for implementing many synchronization primitives.

<doc id="680295" wikidata="Q2815389" url="?curid=680295" title="25 mm caliber">
<text>25 mm caliber is a range of autocannon ammunition. It includes the NATO standardized Swiss 25×137mm, the Swiss 25×184mm, the Soviet 25x218mmSR, and the Chinese 25×183mmB.

==Usage==
The 25 mm round can be used for anti-materiel or anti-personnel purposes. In the anti-personnel role, a 25 mm weapon armed with HE rounds can kill large numbers of opposing troops either in the open or in light fortifications. In the anti-materiel role, a 25 mm weapon armed with armor-piercing rounds can disable many types of aircraft and ground vehicles, including some main battle tanks.

The US military uses 25 mm weapons in their AV-8B Harrier, AC-130 gunship, M2 Bradley, LAV-25, F-35 Lightning II and as a standard ship-based munition in the Mk 38 autocannon.

==Types of 25 mm ammunition==

Several sub-types of the NATO 25 mm ammunition are available—the most common being armor-piercing, high-explosive, sabot, tracer, and practice rounds. Cartridges are usually composed of a combination of the aforementioned categories. For example, the M791 is an armor-piercing discarding sabot with tracer (APDS-T) round. It is used against lightly armored vehicles, self-propelled artillery, and aerial targets such as helicopters and slow-moving fixed-wing aircraft.

<doc id="680296" wikidata="Q930258" url="?curid=680296" title="Billy Papke">
<text>Billy Papke (born William Papke, and known as &quot;The Illinois Thunderbolt&quot;) (September 17, 1886 – November 26, 1936) was an American boxer who held the World Middleweight Championship from September 7 to November 26, 1908. In 1910-12, he also took the Australian and British versions of the World Middleweight Championship, though American boxing historians generally take less note of these titles. With a solid and efficient punch, 70 percent of his better publicized career wins by decision were from knockouts, and roughly 40% of his reported fights were as well. Papke was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2001. Sportswriter Nat Fleischer, original owner of &quot;Ring&quot; Magazine, ranked Papke as the seventh best middleweight of all time. Announcer Charley Rose ranked him as the tenth greatest middleweight in boxing history. He was elected to the Ring Boxing Hall of Fame in 1972.

==Early life and career==
Papke was born on September 17, 1886, in Spring Valley, Illinois. He began his boxing career in 1906, eventually winning 40 fights by decision and drawing six times. He worked as a miner during his years in Illinois and occasionally boxed with fellow miners. His earliest fights in 1906 took place near Spring Valley or Peoria where he had moved by 1907, though he traveled frequently North to box in the next few years.

In an important early bout on September 14, 1907, Papke knocked out Terry Martin in the third round at the National Athletic Club in Philadelphia. The win led several reporters to view Papke as a middleweight title contender.

On November 22, 1907, Papke defeated Bartley Connolly in a fourth round technical knockout. In a one sided bout, Papke floored his opponent once in the first and five times in the third. Connolly tried to clinch in the early rounds to avoid his aggressive and better skilled opponent. In his career, Connolly would defeat the great Joe Walcott, and box in Great Britain.

In a well publicized bout On November 14, 1907, Papke defeated Tony Caponi in their first bout in a second round knockout at the Peoria Club in Peoria, Illinois. After only two minutes and ten seconds of fighting in the second, Papke put Caponi down for the count with a strong right uppercut to the jaw immediately after breaking from a clinch. Caponi tried to rise, but went back down and stayed on the mat. The two had fought two draws the previous May and June, with Papke holding a slight lead during the more recent match. Adding to the interest in the contest was Caponi&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt at Hugo Kelly&#x27;s World and American 158 lb. middleweight championship the previous August.

===American middleweight championship bout with Hugo Kelly, March, 1908===
On March 16, 1908, Papke defeated Hugo Kelly at the Hippodrome in Milwaukee in a ten round points decision that was billed as the world and American 158 pound middleweight championship, though it was not a universally sanctioned bout. There was a significant amount of clinching, and some butting in the match mostly attributed to Papke. Papke put Kelly on the mat in the first round with a blow to the jaw, but Kelly recovered quickly and fought well defensively. There was a shower of blows in the fourth, followed by more clinching in the fifth, as the boxers recovered from fatigue. The final four rounds were close, but the referee decided in favor of Papke at the bell in the tenth. Papke&#x27;s management successfully used the win as a stepping stone to a world middleweight title match with Stanley Ketchel ten weeks later. On May 15, 1909, Papke would defeat Kelly more decisively in a first round knockout in Colma, California.

==Rivalry with middleweight champion Stanley Ketchel==
Papke&#x27;s first meeting with Stanley Ketchel resulted in loss by 10-round points decision, on June 4, 1908, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It was the first of Papke&#x27;s four fights with the reigning Middleweight champion.

===World middleweight championship win, September, 1908===
Papke won the second fight with Ketchel in an upset at Jeffrie&#x27;s Arena in Vernon, near Los Angeles, on September 7, 1908, in a convincing twelve round technical knockout, and impressively took the world middleweight title from the reigning champion. The referee was the thirty-three year old boxing legend and former heavyweight champion James J. Jeffries.

According to legend, Papke helped his chances of winning the fight by punching Ketchel in the face or throat unexpectedly when Ketchel stepped forward with his right hand extended to shake at the beginning of the bout. This legend has been dis-proven by boxing historians, as neither the combatants, nor ringside newspaper reporters, corner men, or other eyewitnesses ever attested to or made record of the incident. A few newspapers including the &quot;Record Argus&quot; of Greenville, Pennsylvania, perpetuated the legend of the sucker punch at the handshake, though the myth may have had its origin in Papke&#x27;s furious attack very early in the first round and the not infrequent habit of a few boxing reporters of the era to embellish their reporting. Even reporting on his death in 1936, a newspaper perpetuated the myth of Papke&#x27;s first blow coming as Ketchel extended his hand to shake.

A California newspaper, likely using the account of a ringside reporter, inferred the fighting did not commence until after the opening bell, and that both men entered the ring in perfect condition, but that within one minute and twenty seconds, Papke had mounted an attack that determined the outcome of the bout. Ketchel was down three times in the first round, and Papke seemed to have the upper hand throughout the fierce and furious bout. The match became so one-sided in favor of Papke by the close, that the crowd yelled for referee Jeffries to stop the fight. Papke dealt the final blows in the twelfth delivering a right swing followed by a powerful hook.

===Loss of world middleweight championship, November, 1908===
In their third meeting, two months later on November 26, 1908, Papke lost his title to Ketchel in an eleventh round knockout in Colma, California, and received a terrific beating in the process. Papke&#x27;s own wife did not recognize him after the bout was over. Ketchel led the bout through most of the first ten rounds. Papke went down in the eleventh for a count of nine, and not long after arising was struck by a left to the chin that ended the bout.

Papke lost the fourth and final meeting by unanimous decision before a large crowd in Colma, California, near San Francisco, on July 5, 1909. It was a particularly savage encounter and lasted 20 rounds. One source wrote that of all their fights it was &quot;the bloodiest and most grueling&quot;. Ketchel was reported to have broken his right hand in the sixth, and Papke a bone in his left.

===Impressive wins over welterweight contender Willie Lewis, 1909-10===
On October 8, 1909, and March 19, 1910, Papke impressively defeated American welterweight contender Willie Lewis in Pittsburgh in a six round newspaper decision, and in France&#x27;s Cirque de Paris in a third round knockout. In their well attended Pittsburgh match, Lewis was down for a nine count as early as the second from a right to the jaw and continued receiving blows to the jaw in the third. Lewis came back only briefly in the fifth, and with a broken nose hung on barely til the closing bell in the sixth. In their heavily attended world welterweight championship bout in Paris, Papke demonstrated superior hitting ability, speed, and defense throughout the match, and was the aggressor through all three rounds. Papke tried to have his agent arrange a match with Ketchel after the bout, but it was never to be.

==Mid career==
After Ketchel&#x27;s murder at age 24, on October 15, 1910, while training at a Cattle Ranch in Conway, Missouri, Papke became one of several middleweights contesting the world middleweight title.

===Four important bouts at Sydney Stadium===
On February 11, 1911, Papke lost to Cyclone Johnny Thompson in Sydney, Australia in a twenty round points decision, with Thompson subsequently claiming Papke&#x27;s world middleweight title. The bout was one of four well-attended bouts he fought for the Australian version of the Middleweight Championship at Sydney Stadium, which included a win against Ed Williams as well as a win by TKO and a loss by DQ to Dave Smith. In Papke&#x27;s TKO victory against Smith, Smith led through six rounds, but went down three times before his seconds threw in the towel. Smith would later take the Australian Light Heavyweight and Heavyweight Championships, as well as compete for the Australian Middleweight Championship.

On August 22, 1911, Papke had a surprising loss to Sailor Burke, at St. Nicholas Arena in New York City in a newspaper decision of the &quot;New York Times&quot;. Papke was defending his World Middleweight title which he took at London&#x27;s Palladium in a ninth round knockout from Jim Sullivan two months earlier on June 8, 1911. Burke battered Papke, but used little science in his approach. Attending the fight, and likely disappointed, was the Scottish reporter Percy Douglas, 10th Marquess of Queensberry, a member of the royal line and son of the 9th Marquess, who had endorsed the modern boxing rules published by Welshman John Graham Chambers in 1867. The title did not pass hands as both men were over the middleweight weight limit of 160, and weighing nearer 165.

After an October, 1911 loss in Boston to Bob Moha, he briefly retired, but he would soon return to the ring.

===Loss to Frank Mantel, middleweight contender, February, 1912===
On February 22, 1912, Papke lost to American world middleweight contender Frank Mantell in Sacramento in a twenty round points decision. It was a slow bout with much vertical wrestling while the contestants weakly attempted to score blows during the clinches. After the bout, Mantell tried to claim Papke&#x27;s former British world middleweight title of June 11, 1911, taken from Jim Sullivan in London. Mantell&#x27;s claim was weak, however, as Papke claimed he did not make weight for the match.

===Win over Marcel Moreau in Paris, June, 1912===
On June 29, 1912, Papke, defending his June, 1911 world middleweight title, defeated Marcel Moreau at France&#x27;s Cirque de Paris in a sixteenth round technical knockout. 
Papke was down in the first, while Moreau was knocked down twice in the fifteenth by left and right hooks before failing to show for the final round.

Papke lost to middle and welterweight contender Leo Houck in the third week of September 1912 at the Olympia Athletic Club in Philadelphia in a six round newspaper decision. The first two rounds were slow, with Papke staging a comeback in the third which was marred by his tossing Houck around in the clinches and refusing to break at the referee&#x27;s request. His clinching may have signaled his fatigue from the repeated blows of his opponent. In the final three rounds, Houck dominated, throwing several swift blows with no return in the fourth, and sending Papke through the ropes in the sixth.

===Win over European middleweight champion Georges Carpentier, October 1912===
Papke traveled to Paris where he beat future champion Georges Carpentier in an eighteenth round technical knockout on October 23, 1912. It became a non-championship fight when Papke exceeded the middle-weight limit at the pre-fight weigh-in. Papke&#x27;s infighting or close range techniques baffled the skilled Carpentier. At the end of the eighth, Carpentier&#x27;s right eye was closed, and he fought more cautiously. Though staging a comeback in the fifteenth and sixteenth, Carpentier was floored in the opening of the seventeenth round, when Papke struck him with a left hook, likely taking advantage of the reduced vision on his opponent&#x27;s right side. Carpentier attempted to fight on but gave up after consulting with his corner men, and did not return for the eighteenth round.

===Final loss of the world middleweight championship to Frank Klaus, March 1913===
Papke was beaten by an American, Pennsylvania middleweight Frank Klaus on March 5, 1913, at France&#x27;s Cirque de Paris. The referee warned Papke and called fouls and breaks repeatedly in the late rounds for wrestling, head-butting, and low blows. In frustration, the referee called his last foul in the fifteenth round for a low blow which Papke had been called on in the previous two rounds, disqualifying Papke and ending both the match and Papke&#x27;s title hopes.

After his October 14, 1913, loss to Marty Rowan in St. Louis, Papke took a three year hiatus from the ring, before returning in 1916, and facing his last few opponents.

He continued fighting until 1919, losing a four rounder to the prolific boxer and contender Soldier Bartfield in San Francisco in April 1919.

==Boxing retirement, death and legacy==
On November 22, 1932, Papke came out of his 1919 boxing retirement to stage a three round exhibition with heavyweight &quot;Fireman&quot; Jim Flynn, the only boxer who ever knocked out Jack Dempsey. He had lost to Flynn earlier in a newspaper decision in March 1909 in Pasadena.

===Appearances in boxing movies===
In his retirement near Los Angeles, he benefited from his real estate investments. He appeared in at least three boxing-themed movies; &quot;The Prince of Broadway&quot; (1926) which featured boxers Leach Cross, Frankie Genaro, and Ad Wolgast, &quot;Madison Square Garden&quot; (1932), where he appeared as himself as did other boxers and sports writers, and &quot;The Prizefighter and the Lady&quot; (1933), which starred heavyweight champion Max Baer (boxer).

===Death===
Near the time of his death, he was working as a &quot;host&quot; at Jim Flynn&#x27;s Cafe in Los Angeles, a beer hall named after the heavyweight boxer. He had recently refereed a boxing match.

Papke died on November 27, 1936, by suicide, after first killing his wife. The violent incident may have been a result of undiagnosed brain dementia suffered from years of trauma in the ring. It occurred at his wife Edna&#x27;s residence on Balboa Island, part of Newport Beach, south of Los Angeles in Southern California. Papke was disappointed about his wife&#x27;s recent divorce and was hoping for a reconciliation. Both he and his wife were buried at Mt. View Cemetery in Altadena, California, slightly North of Pasadena and Los Angeles. He left three sons with whom he lived, Robert, Clifford, and William A. Papke Jr.

He is a primary character in the novel, &quot;The Killings of Stanley Ketchel,&quot; (2005), by James Carlos Blake.

<text>Ingo Molnár, employed by Red Hat as of May 2013, is a Hungarian Linux hacker. He is known for his contributions to the operating system in terms of security and performance.

== Life and career ==
Molnár studied at Eötvös Loránd University.

==Work==
Some of his additions to the Linux kernel include the O(1) scheduler of Linux-2.6.0 and the Completely Fair Scheduler of Linux-2.6.23, the in-kernel TUX HTTP / FTP server, as well as his work to enhance thread handling. He also wrote a kernel security feature called &quot;Exec Shield&quot;, which prevents stack-based buffer overflow exploits in the x86 architecture by disabling the execute permission for the stack.

Together with Thomas Gleixner, he worked on the real-time preemption (PREEMPT_RT) patch set, which aims to reduce the maximum thread switching latency of the Linux kernel from an unbounded number of milliseconds to down to bounded values in the order of tens of microseconds (depending on the system). As of 2011, Thomas Gleixner is working on further improving the patch and getting important infrastructure patches of the patch set merged into the Mainline Linux kernel.

Between Linux 2.6.21 and Linux 2.6.24, he worked on the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) which was inspired by the scheduler work of Con Kolivas.
CFS replaced the previous process scheduler of the Linux kernel with Linux-2.6.23.

In 2012 Molnar criticized the Linux desktop as &quot;not free enough&quot; for the users with respect to the applications. He argues that the typically used system of software distribution and deployment by a centrally organized Linux distributions is not fast and flexible enough to satisfy the requirements of users and application producers alike. Molnár suggests a decentral deployment method (similar to Autopackage, Zero Install, or the Klik-successor AppImage) which allows a more flexible application infrastructure formed by a stable platform and independent software providers.

In early 2022, he submitted an RFC on a set of about 2300 patches, called &quot;Fast Kernel Headers&quot;, that are intended to improve kernel compile times by 50-80% and at the same time significantly reduce the problems created by the hierarchy and dependencies of include files, the so-called &quot;dependency hell&quot;.

<text>The Royal Dutch Football Association (, ; KNVB ) is the governing body of football in the Netherlands. It organises the main Dutch football leagues (Eredivisie and Eerste Divisie), the amateur leagues, the KNVB Cup, and the Dutch men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s national teams.

For three seasons in the 2010s, the KNVB and its Belgian counterpart operated a joint top-level women&#x27;s league, the BeNe League, until the two countries dissolved the league after the 2014–15 season and re-established their own top-level leagues. The KNVB is based in the central municipality of Zeist. With over 1.2 million members, the KNVB is the single largest sports association in the Netherlands.

==History==
In 1889, the Nederlandse Voetbal en Athletiek Bond was founded. Due to certain disagreements, several football clubs ended their association with it and joined together to form Koninklijke Nederlandse Voetbalbond (KNVB) which was later renamed to its present name. It was one of the founding members of FIFA in 1904 and one of the first non-British football associations in Europe. The first Dutch football club was formed in 1879 in Haarlem. The Netherlands Football League Championship had already existed unofficially for a decade when the association was founded. The KNVB strongly disapproved of the professionalism of football in 1909. It said that &quot;it will protest against it by all means necessary.&quot; In 2012, the KNVB launched an 11-point action plan, called &#x27;Football for everyone&#x27; to promote gay football players in coming out. It released a 30-second video named &#x27;Gay? It doesn&#x27;t matter&#x27;; prepared by broadcaster BNN. The video was also broadcast during the Dutch national football teams World Cup qualifier match against Andorra held in October 2012.

During the 2014 FIFA World Cup, it collaborated with Royal Philips to open six football clinics across Brazil. Bert van Oostveen is the current Secretary-General of KNVB.

The series explanation was that Gina was &quot;out on business&quot;, though in the two-part episode &quot;Going Overboard&quot; it was stated that Gina had arrived too late to board the boat for the trip alongside everyone else.

<doc id="680326" wikidata="Q7918263" url="?curid=680326" title="Vega machine">
<text>Vega machines are a type of electroacupuncture device used in pseudoscientific Vega testing, which proponents claim can diagnose allergies and other illnesses. The forerunner to the Vega test was electroacupuncture according to Voll developed by Reinholdt Voll in the 1950s. Helmut Schimmel modified the technique in the 1970s and presented it under the name Vega test.

Several medical associations have advised against their use, including the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, the Australian College of Allergy, the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology and the Allergy Society of South Africa. In 1990 a medical practitioner was censured by the Medical Practitioners Disciplinary Committee in New Zealand for using a Vega machine. Another practitioner was censured by the Discipline Committee of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario in 1999 for having &quot;failed to meet the standard of practice&quot; in his use of the Vega machine in diagnosis.

Reviews of the available evidence in the medical literature indicate that electrodermal testing, such as that performed with a Vega machine, is ineffective at diagnosing allergies and recommend that it not be used.

<text>FM4 is an Austrian national radio station operated by the ORF. Its main target is the youth audience, and much of the music output is characterised by an alternative rock and electronic music slant.

==Programmimg==
The programming of &quot;FM4&quot; is also notable for its high level of spoken word content, much of which is produced in the English language. Morning programmes, including the current affairs-based &quot;Reality Check&quot; and &quot;Update&quot;, are broadcast in English while afternoon shows &quot;Connected&quot; and &quot;Homebase&quot; are German-speaking. News updates in French were also transmitted twice a day up until 2019 when they were discontinued due to reduced demand.

==History==
&quot;FM4&quot; was launched on 16 January 1995 and initially shared its frequencies with English-language ORF radio station Blue Danube Radio, created principally for the United Nations community at UNO City in Vienna. From its launch in 1995 until 31 January 2000 &quot;FM4&quot; was only on-air during evenings and night times from 7pm-6am. Since 1 February 2000 &quot;FM4&quot; has broadcast its programmes 24/7, when the station was merged with Blue Danube Radio (resulting in the English programmes being broadcast today).

At launch, &quot;FM4&quot; was known as an underground radio station, but full-time broadcasting has increased its popularity and listening figures considerably. It describes its format as &quot;alternative mainstream&quot;. As well as increasing popularity in Austria itself, a growing number of listeners are tuning in outside the country, most notably in the German state of Bavaria. In 2005, FM4 held its first music festival outside Austria, in Munich.

The website is an essential part of the &quot;FM4&quot; concept. Selected web hosts such as Boris Jordan, Johannes Grenzfurthner and Hans Wu post reports, articles or essays about various topics.

In 2001, FM4 teamed up with concert promoter Musicnet to create the FM4 Frequency Festival. This has become the biggest alternative music festival in Austria, and predominantly features artists and bands who appear on the FM4 playlist.

On 26 October 2001 the FM4 Soundpark was launched, creating an online platform on which young musicians can publish their work for free to reach FM4&#x27;s audience.

FM4&#x27;s programme director is Doroteja Gradištanac. The most famous voice of FM4 is former Blue Danube Radio host Joe Remick.

FM4 has released a number of compilation albums under its &quot;Sound Selection&quot; and &quot;Sunny Side Up&quot; brands, as well as a DVD (FM4 - The Early Years), which was produced to mark the station&#x27;s 10th anniversary in 2005.

<text>Jennifer Grey (born March 26, 1960) is an American actress. She made her acting debut with the film &quot;Reckless&quot; (1984), and had her breakthrough with the teen comedy film &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; (1986). She earned worldwide fame starring as Frances &quot;Baby&quot; Houseman in the romantic drama film &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; (1987), which earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination. Her other feature films include &quot;Red Dawn&quot; (1984), &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; (1984), &quot;Bloodhounds of Broadway&quot; (1989), &quot;Bounce&quot; (2000), &quot;Redbelt&quot; (2008), &quot;The Wind Rises&quot; (2013), &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; (2014), &quot;Bittersweet Symphony&quot; (2019), and &quot;A Real Pain&quot; (2024).

Grey&#x27;s early television work includes the made-for-TV films &quot;Murder in Mississippi&quot; (1990), &quot;Criminal Justice&quot; (1990), and &quot;If the Shoe Fits&quot; as Kelly Carter / Prudence (1990). She starred as herself in the series &quot;It&#x27;s Like, You Know...&quot; (1999–2001), won season eleven of the dancing competition series &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; (2010) and starred as Judy Meyers in the Amazon Prime Video comedy &quot;Red Oaks&quot; (2014–2017). Her voice work in film and television includes the 2018 film &quot;Duck Duck Goose&quot; and the 2008–2014 animated television series &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;.

==Early life==
Jennifer Grey was born on March 26, 1960, in New York City to former actress/singer Jo Wilder (née Brower) and stage and Academy Award-winning screen actor Joel Grey. Her paternal grandfather was comedian and musician Mickey Katz. Grey&#x27;s parents both came from Jewish families.

Grey attended the Dalton School, a private school in Manhattan where she studied dance and acting, and where she met her best friend, actress Tracy Pollan. After graduating in 1978, Grey enrolled at Manhattan&#x27;s Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre for two years of training as an actress. While waiting for roles, she supported herself waitressing.

==Career==

===Early career===
Grey made her commercial debut at age 19 in an ad for Dr Pepper, then made her film debut in a small role in &quot;Reckless&quot; (1984), followed by another small role, in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; in 1984. That year she starred in the war film &quot;Red Dawn&quot;, then went on to the 1985 John Badham project &quot;American Flyers&quot;.

===Breakthrough and commercial success===

In 1986 she played the role of jealous sister Jeannie Bueller in the John Hughes comedy film &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;, opposite Matthew Broderick. The film was commercially successful and received a positive critical reception.

The following year she reunited with Patrick Swayze, her &quot;Red Dawn&quot; co-star, to play Frances &quot;Baby&quot; Houseman in &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot;, a coming-of-age love story: spending the summer at a Catskills resort with her family, Frances &quot;Baby&quot; Houseman falls in love with the resort&#x27;s dance instructor, Johnny Castle. The low-budget film was a surprise hit, was the first film to sell one million copies on video, and is considered a classic. She was paid $50,000 for her role, which came to define her career, and she was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actress for the role.

Grey&#x27;s sole Broadway theatre credit is her 1993 appearance in &quot;The Twilight of the Golds&quot;.

Despite the success of &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot;, Grey felt that her looks would place restrictions on the type of future roles she would be considered for. After consulting her mother and three plastic surgeons in the early 1990s, she underwent two rhinoplasty procedures. The second was necessary to correct an irregularity caused by the first operation and ended up being more extensive than Grey had expected. This resulted in a nose that caused even close friends to fail to recognize her, and the major change in her appearance affected her career. Of the experience, she said, &quot;I went in the operating room a celebrity—and came out anonymous. It was like being in a witness protection program or being invisible.&quot; Grey recalled in a 2020 interview that an airline employee who checked her identity refused to believe that she and the actress the employee knew from &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; were one and the same. Grey briefly considered changing her name in order to start her career anew, but ultimately decided against this.

===Later career===
From March 1999 until January 2000, Grey starred as herself in the short-lived ABC sitcom &quot;It&#x27;s Like, You Know...&quot;, which satirized her much-publicized nose job as a running gag.

Grey appeared with Shirley MacLaine, Liza Minnelli, and Kathy Bates in the CBS television movie &quot;The West Side Waltz&quot;, adapted by Ernest Thompson from his play. She appeared in one episode of &quot;Friends&quot; as Mindy, a high school friend of Jennifer Aniston&#x27;s character Rachel. She had a small role in the 2000 film &quot;Bounce&quot; with Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Affleck. In 2007, Grey portrayed Daphne on the HBO series &quot;John from Cincinnati&quot;. In 2010, she played Abbey, the mother of a sick child in the season seven &quot;House&quot; episode &quot;Unplanned Parenthood&quot;.

Grey was a contestant on season eleven of &quot;Dancing With the Stars&quot;. She was partnered with professional dancer Derek Hough. She came out very strong at first, frequently topping the leaderboard. However, injuries, stress, and exhaustion took their toll on Grey, and for a couple of weeks, she fell behind. In week seven, however, she improved, tying with previous frontrunner Brandy Norwood. On November 23, 2010, Grey and her partner Hough won the competition, making her the oldest female winner in the competition.

In September 2011 Grey appeared in the Lifetime movie &quot;Bling Ring&quot; as Iris Garvey, the mother of Zack Garvey. On November 5 and 6, 2011, Grey stood in for head judge Len Goodman on the BBC One TV show &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;.

Grey voiced Mrs. Kurokawa in the English dub version of Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s film &quot;The Wind Rises&quot;.

From 2014 to 2017, Grey portrayed Judy Meyers on &quot;Red Oaks&quot;. In 2018, Grey co-starred in the film &quot;Untogether&quot;; the film was released on February 8, 2019.

Grey also appeared at the 2015 Tony Awards alongside her father Joel, presenting a performance from the musical &quot;Fun Home&quot;.

Ballantine Books published Grey&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Out of the Corner&quot;, on May 3, 2022.

==Personal life==

On August 5, 1987, Grey suffered severe whiplash in a car collision in Tempo, Northern Ireland, while vacationing with actor Matthew Broderick, whom she had begun dating in semi-secrecy during the filming of &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;. The crash, the event through which their relationship became public, occurred when Broderick, at the wheel of a rented BMW, crossed into the wrong lane and collided head-on with a Volvo driven by a local mother and daughter, Margaret Doherty, 63, and Anna Gallagher, 28, who were killed instantly. Broderick was convicted of careless driving and fined $175. &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; was released a few weeks after the collision, catapulting Grey to fame. But she has said that her grief and survivor&#x27;s guilt over the crash prevented her from enjoying the film&#x27;s success and led her to withdraw from acting for some time.

Grey was also romantically involved with actors Michael J. Fox, Johnny Depp, William Baldwin and then-aide to President Clinton, George Stephanopoulos. She married actor/director Clark Gregg on July 21, 2001. They have a daughter. They lived in Venice, California. The couple co-starred in the Lifetime movie &quot;The Road to Christmas&quot; in 2006. On July 3, 2020, Grey and Gregg announced they had separated amicably in January, and were in the process of divorcing. Their divorce became final on February 16, 2021.

According to a September 2015 Grey profile in &quot;Jewish Journal&quot;, Grey had recently reconnected with Judaism, saying, &quot;I love being a Jew. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot more Jewish in the last five years because of my daughter&#x27;s &quot;bat mitzvah&quot;, and I realized I really care about being a Jew.&quot;

Prior to her 2010 appearances on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, Grey had a physical examination to ensure that she was fit enough to compete and saw a doctor to address chronic neck problems caused by the car crash decades earlier. Her spinal cord was compressed and her surgeon placed a titanium plate in her neck to stabilize it. He also found a cancerous nodule on her thyroid that he removed in 2009. Grey said she believed the cancer was caught before it could metastasize and that she was now cancer-free.

In January 2017, Grey participated in the Los Angeles 2017 Women&#x27;s March.

<text>Ruthless People is a 1986 American black comedy film directed by David Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and Jerry Zucker and written by Dale Launer. It stars Danny DeVito, Bette Midler, Judge Reinhold, Anita Morris, and Helen Slater, with Bill Pullman in a supporting role in his film debut. The film is the story of a couple who kidnap their ex-boss&#x27;s wife to get revenge and extort money from him. They soon realize he does not want her back and was planning to kill her himself. Meanwhile, the boss&#x27;s mistress plans a blackmail attempt on him, which also fails to go as planned.

The film was a critical and commercial success. This was the last film released under the Touchstone Films label before Walt Disney Studios changed the name of the label to Touchstone Pictures as well as the last film directed by the Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker trio together.

==Plot==
Beverly Hills fashion tycoon Sam Stone despises his wife, Barbara, having married her for her family wealth, and plans to murder her so he can inherit her $15million fortune and retire with his mistress Carol. He returns home armed with chloroform but finds Barbara is missing and receives a call from her abductor, demanding $500,000 for her return and threatening to kill her if the police or media are involved. Hoping to get Barbara killed, a delighted Sam deliberately ignores the demands.

The abductors, Ken and Sandy Kessler, are a lower-class couple targeting Sam because he built his business using the Kesslers&#x27; life savings and fashion designs he stole from Sandy. They detain Barbara in their basement but she proves difficult to control, and Sandy feels guilty about their actions. Intending to financially blackmail Sam, Carol sends her lover Earl to film Sam at the cliff from which he intended to dispose of Barbara, but, unaware of Sam&#x27;s appearance, Earl unwittingly films a man having sex with a prostitute, mistaking her screams for Barbara dying. Without watching the tape, Carol forwards a copy to Sam who assumes it is a seductive birthday present, and she interprets his lewd response as a threat, causing her and Earl to go into hiding.

Bored and overweight, Barbara begins following television exercise programs. She is eventually overjoyed to realize she has lost and bonds with Sandy after being impressed by her fashion ideas and dress designs, into which she now can fit. Meanwhile, Ken repeatedly drops the ransom price, eventually reaching $10,000, but Sam refuses to pay and encourages Ken to kill Barbara. Although Ken is confronted as a suspect because of tire tracks at the Stone residence, the investigation is redirected when Carol, hoping to incriminate Sam, sends another copy of the tape to police chief Henry Benton, unaware he is the man on the tape. Assuming he is being blackmailed, Benton has Sam investigated and arrested following the discovery of the chloroform and photos of him with Carol.

Realizing he is incapable of being a ruthless criminal, Ken returns home to collect Sandy and flee to Mexico. He learns that Sandy has released Barbara and they want to work together to develop and sell Sandy&#x27;s fashion designs. The Bedroom Killer, a notorious local serial killer, invades their home and confronts them and Barbara as she returns, leading to an altercation in which he dies after falling down the basement stairs. Realizing that Sam wanted her dead and having learned of his affair, Barbara collaborates with Ken and Sandy to take revenge by blackmailing him for his entire personal fortune worth over $2.2million. After being bailed out of jail, Sam reluctantly collects the ransom in a briefcase, desperate to prove his innocence in Barbara&#x27;s disappearance. Carol finally views the tape and, realizing Earl&#x27;s mistake, reconnects with Sam to learn when the ransom handover will take place and that the police, now distrustful of Sam, will not accompany him.

Earl ambushes Sam and a masked Ken at the exchange, but they are surrounded by scores of SWAT officers, and Earl is arrested. Ken warns the cops that Barbara will be killed if they try to stop him, and drives off followed by a police convoy. Cornered, he drives off the end of the Santa Monica Pier and seemingly drowns. The police recover the body of the Bedroom Killer, disguised as Ken, from the car but are unable to locate the ransom money. Despite his loss, Sam is elated that Barbara must be dead until she arrives on the pier, identifies the Killer as her abductor, and kicks Sam into the water. Elsewhere, Ken emerges from the ocean in scuba gear, carrying the briefcase, and celebrates with the waiting Sandy and Barbara.

==Production==
The set design for the majority of the interiors of the home of Sam and Barbara Stone extensively employs the Italian radical design furniture and lighting from the Memphis Group.

The directors normally wrote all their own material. However, they were contacted by Michael Eisner, who became head of Disney after working with the trio at Paramount. According to David Zucker, Eisner &quot;said he had a script that we wouldn&#x27;t be able to turn down and he was right. It was too good. It was very well written with great characters. And hey we wouldn&#x27;t have to leave town to do it.&quot;

While directing Jerry Zucker would be on set talking to the actors while the other two would watch from monitors and give comments.

The trio found the making of the film difficult due to them having to direct a script none of them had written as well as the film&#x27;s style being different from their previous work. It also contributed to their eventual split in the 90s with Jerry Zucker stating “it became evident that if we were going to do (scripts written by other people), we’d have to direct separately.”

==Reception==
The film was a financial success, grossing $71.6 million compared to the relatively frugal budget of the film&#x27;s production. It was Disney&#x27;s highest-grossing film (excluding reissues). On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 93% based on 43 reviews, with an average score of 7.1/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;It&#x27;s sometimes crude and tasteless, but &quot;Ruthless People&quot; wrings acid-soaked laughs out of its dark premise and gleefully misanthropic characters.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a score of 78 based on 15 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert said that the film &quot;is made out of good performances, a script of diabolical ingenuity, and a whole lot of silliness.&quot; Leonard Maltin agreed that this &quot;clever farce&quot; has &quot;lots of laughs, bright performances, but turns sour: these really &quot;are&quot; unpleasant people!&quot;

Although it has been argued that &quot;Ruthless People&quot; was influenced by O. Henry&#x27;s story &quot;The Ransom of Red Chief&quot;, writer Dale Launer claims that it was inspired by the kidnapping of Patricia Hearst and that the similarities between the film and the earlier story were a coincidence.

The Telugu Film Money (1993 film) is loosely based on this film

==Soundtrack==
The album&#x27;s soundtrack was released on Epic Records. The track, &quot;Waiting to See You&quot; by Dan Hartman, is missing the first several drum bars on the CD release contained on the vinyl and cassette releases. The soundtrack version of &quot;Ruthless People&quot; is similar to the version heard in the film, including both an extended intro and a second verse edited out of the single version.

<text>The Northern Ireland peace process includes the events leading up to the 1994 Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) ceasefire, the end of most of the violence of the Troubles, the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, and subsequent political developments.

==Timeline==
===Towards a ceasefire===

In 1994, talks between the leaders of the two main Irish nationalist parties in Northern Ireland, John Hume of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), and Gerry Adams of Sinn Féin (SF), continued. These talks led to a series of joint statements on how the violence might be brought to an end. The talks had been going on since the late 1980s and had secured the backing of the Irish government through an intermediary, the priest Alec Reid.

In November it was revealed that the British government had also been in talks with the Provisional IRA, although they had long denied it.

On Wednesday 15 December 1993, the Downing Street Declaration was issued by John Major, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and Albert Reynolds, Taoiseach, on behalf of the British and Irish governments. This included statements that:
*The British government had no &quot;selfish strategic or economic&quot; interest in Northern Ireland. This statement would lead, eventually, to the repeal of the Government of Ireland Act 1920.
*The British government would uphold the right of the people of Northern Ireland to decide between the Union with Great Britain or a united Ireland.
*The people of the island of Ireland, North and South, had the exclusive right to solve the issues between North and South by mutual consent.
*The Irish government would try to address unionist fears of a united Ireland by amending the Irish Constitution according to the principle of consent. This would lead, eventually, to the modification of the Articles 2 and 3.
*A united Ireland could only be brought about by peaceful means.
*Peace must involve a permanent end to the use of, or support for, paramilitary violence.

Ian Paisley of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) opposed the Declaration, James Molyneaux of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) argued that it was not a &quot;sell-out&quot; of unionists, and Gerry Adams of Sinn Féin requested dialogue with the governments and clarification of the Declaration.

===Towards negotiations===
On 6 April 1994, the Provisional IRA announced a three-day &quot;temporary cessation of hostilities&quot; to run from Wednesday 6 April – Friday 8 April 1994.

Five months later, on Wednesday 31 August 1994, the Provisional IRA announced a &quot;cessation of military operations&quot; from midnight. Albert Reynolds, the Irish Taoiseach, said that he accepted the IRA statement as implying a permanent ceasefire. Many unionists were sceptical. UUP leader James Molyneaux, in a rare slip, declared &quot;This (the ceasefire) is the worst thing that has ever happened to us.&quot;

In the following period, there were disputes about the permanence of the ceasefire, whether parties linked to paramilitaries should be included in talks, and the rate of &quot;normalisation&quot; in Northern Ireland. Loyalist bombings and shootings, and punishment beatings from both sides, continued.

This is an abbreviated list of events of significance in the lead-up to all-party negotiations:
*13 October 1994: The Combined Loyalist Military Command, representing the Ulster Volunteer Force, Ulster Defence Association and Red Hand Commandos announce a loyalist paramilitary ceasefire.
*Friday 15 December 1994: Albert Reynolds resigned as Taoiseach of the Republic of Ireland following the collapse of his Fianna Fáil/Labour coalition. He was succeeded by John Bruton, heading a &quot;Rainbow Coalition&quot; of Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left.
*Wednesday 22 February 1995: Framework Documents published: 
**&quot;A New Framework For Agreement&quot;, which dealt with north–south institutions, and
**&quot;A Framework for Accountable Government in Northern Ireland&quot;, which proposed a single-chamber 90-member Assembly, to be elected by proportional representation and which was put directly to the electorate in 1997 by Conservative Party candidates standing in Northern Ireland at the general election.The proposals were not welcomed by unionists and the DUP described it as a &quot;one-way street to Dublin&quot; and a &quot;joint government programme for Irish unity&quot;.
*Sunday 13 August 1995: Gerry Adams, Sinn Féin President, addressed a demonstration at Belfast City Hall. A member of the crowd called out to Adams to, &quot;bring back the IRA&quot;. In reply Adams said: &quot;They haven&#x27;t gone away, you know&quot;.
*Friday 8 September 1995: David Trimble was elected leader of the UUP, replacing James Molyneaux.
*Friday 24 November 1995: a referendum in the Republic of Ireland to change the constitution to allow divorce was narrowly approved, with 50.2% in favour. Divorce had long been available north of the border. The ban in the Republic was sometimes cited by (mainly Protestant) unionists as evidence of excessive influence by the Catholic Church in the Republic which would (in the event of a United Ireland) represent a threat to the religious liberty of non-Catholics.
*Tuesday 28 November 1995: a joint communiqué by the British and Irish Governments outlined a &quot;&#x27;twin-track&#x27; process to make progress in parallel on the decommissioning issue and on all-party negotiations&quot;. Preparatory talks were to lead to all-party negotiations beginning by the end of February 1996. US Senator George Mitchell was to lead an international body to provide an independent assessment of the decommissioning issue.
*Thursday 30 November 1995: Bill Clinton, then President of the United States, visited Northern Ireland, and spoke in favour of the &quot;peace process&quot; to a huge rally at Belfast&#x27;s City Hall. He called terrorists &quot;yesterday&#x27;s men&quot;.
*Wednesday 20 December 1995: blaming the Provisional IRA for recent killings of drug dealers, the Irish government decided not to give permanent release to a further ten republican prisoners.
*Wednesday 24 January 1996: Dated 22 January, the report of the International Body on arms decommissioning (also known as the Mitchell Report) set out the six &quot;Mitchell Principles&quot; under which parties could enter into all-party talks, and suggested a number of confidence-building measures, including an &quot;elective process&quot;. The main conclusion was that decommissioning of paramilitary arms should take place during (rather than before or after) all-party talks, in a &quot;twin-track&quot; process. The report was welcomed by the Irish government and the main opposition parties in Britain and the Republic, as well as the Social Democratic and Labour Party and the Alliance Party. It was accepted as a way forward by Sinn Féin and the Ulster Democratic Party (UDP), who both had paramilitary links. The moderate unionist party, the UUP, expressed reservations, and the more hardline DUP rejected it outright.
*Monday 29 January 1996: &quot;Twin-track&quot; talks began with the SDLP, the Progressive Unionist Party, and the UDP. The UUP declined the invitation.
*Friday 9 February 1996: one hour after a statement ending their ceasefire, the Provisional IRA detonated a large lorry bomb near South Quay DLR station in the London Docklands, killing two people, injuring 40, and causing £150 million worth of damage. The IRA ceasefire had lasted 17 months and 9 days. The IRA statement said that the ceasefire was ended because &quot;the British government acted in bad faith with Mr Major and the unionist leaders squandering this unprecedented opportunity to resolve the conflict&quot; by refusing to allow Sinn Féin into the talks until the IRA decommissioned its arms. Albert Reynolds, while not supporting the bombing, concurred with the IRA analysis. As Major&#x27;s Government had lost its majority in Parliament and was depending on unionist votes to stay in power, it was widely accused of pro-unionist bias as a result. On the other hand, on the day of the bombing, Major had been preparing to meet with Sinn Féin representatives at Downing Street for the first time.

===Towards another ceasefire===
*Friday 16 February 1996: There was a large peace rally at City Hall, Belfast, and a number of smaller rallies at venues across Northern Ireland.
*Wednesday 28 February 1996: After a summit in London, the British and Irish prime ministers set a date (10 June 1996) for the start of all-party talks, and stated that participants would have to agree to abide by the six Mitchell Principles and that there would be preparatory &#x27;proximity talks&#x27;.
*Monday 4 March 1996: Proximity talks were launched at Stormont. The Ulster Unionist Party and the Democratic Unionist Party refused to join, and Sinn Féin were again refused entry, ostensibly because of IRA violence.
*Thursday 21 March 1996: Elections to determine who would take part in all-party negotiations were announced. The elections would be to a Forum of 110 delegates, with 90 elected directly and 20 &#x27;top-up&#x27; seats from the ten parties polling the most votes.
*Thursday 18 April 1996: The &quot;Northern Ireland (Entry to Negotiations) Act&quot; was passed at Westminster. 30 parties and individuals were to take part in the election.

*Monday 10 June 1996: All-party negotiations (the &#x27;Stormont talks&#x27;) began in Stormont. Sinn Féin were again refused entry.
*Friday 14 June 1996: The Northern Ireland Forum met for the first time in Belfast. Sinn Féin declined to take part due to their policy of not taking seats in either the Westminster parliament or a regional &quot;partitionist&quot; Northern Ireland parliament (latter policy changed in 1998).
*Saturday 15 June 1996: The IRA exploded a bomb in Manchester, which destroyed a large part of the city centre and injured 212 people. Niall Donovan (28), a Catholic man, was stabbed to death near Dungannon, County Tyrone by the loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF).
*Thursday 20 June 1996: An IRA bomb factory was found by Gardaí in the Republic. In response the Irish government ended all contacts with Sinn Féin.
*Sunday 7 July 1996: As part of the ongoing Drumcree conflict, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) prevented a march by Portadown Orangemen from returning from Drumcree Church via the mainly nationalist Garvaghy Road. This decision was followed by widespread protest in the unionist community, and by rioting in unionist areas.
*Thursday 11 July 1996: Hugh Annesley, then Chief Constable of the RUC, reversed his decision and ordered his officers to allow the Orange march to pass along the Garvaghy Road in Portadown. No music was played as the parade passed the disputed area. This was followed by nationalist protests, and riots in republican areas.
*Saturday 13 July 1996: A republican car-bomb attack on a hotel in Enniskillen injured 17. The Continuity Irish Republican Army later claimed responsibility. The SDLP announced that it would withdraw from the Northern Ireland Forum.
*Monday 15 July 1996: A committee to review parades in Northern Ireland (the Independent Review of Parades and Marches) was announced.
*Thursday 30 January 1997: The Report of the Independent Review of Parades and Marches (The &quot;North Report&quot;) recommended setting up an independent commission to review contentious parades. Most nationalists welcomed the review but unionists attacked it as an erosion of the right to freedom of assembly. A period of &quot;further consultation&quot; was announced.
*Wednesday 5 March 1997: Stormont Talks adjourned until 3 June, to allow the parties to contest the forthcoming general election.
*Monday 7 April 1997: &quot;The Belfast Telegraph&quot; published the first of three articles over three days with results of an opinion survey it conducted in collaboration with Queens University. Survey questions were developed in cooperation with the 10 leading parties in Northern Ireland. Ninety-three per cent of Protestants and 97 per cent of Catholics said they &quot;support the principle of a negotiated settlement for the political future of Northern Ireland,&quot; but only 25 per cent of Protestants and 28 per cent of Catholics believed the &quot;Talks&quot; would lead to a settlement.
*Sunday 27 April 1997: In Portadown Robert Hamill, a Catholic, was severely beaten in a sectarian attack by a gang of loyalists. Hamill later died from his injuries.
*Thursday 1 May 1997: A general election was held across the UK. The Labour Party won a majority and formed a government for the first time since 1979. In Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin had increased its share of the vote to 16%, becoming the third largest party in the region, and winning two seats: Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness were their new MPs. The Ulster Unionist Party won 10 seats, the Social Democratic and Labour Party 3, the Democratic Unionist Party 2, and the UK Unionist Party 1.
*Monday 12 May 1997: Sean Brown, a 61 year old father of six from Bellaghy, County Londonderry, was abducted and murdered on May 12 1997. An instructor at the Ballymena Training Centre, Mr Brown played an active role in the GAA.
*Friday 16 May 1997: Tony Blair, the new British Prime Minister, endorsed the Framework Documents, the Mitchell Report on decommissioning, and the criteria for inclusion in all-party talks. He stated that he valued Northern Ireland&#x27;s place in the United Kingdom, and suggested that the Republic of Ireland should amend Articles 2 and 3 of its constitution, and indicated that officials would meet Sinn Féin to clarify certain issues.
*Wednesday 21 May 1997: In local government Elections the UUP remained the largest unionist party, and the SDLP the largest nationalist party, though they lost control of Belfast and Derry city councils respectively.
*Sunday 1 June 1997: Gregory Taylor, an off-duty RUC constable, died following a beating he received from a loyalist mob. It was later disclosed that Taylor had used his mobile phone to try to summon help from the local police station but no car was available to come to his aid.
*Tuesday 3 June 1997: The talks resumed at Stormont. The Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) and the Continuity Irish Republican Army (CIRA) were both proscribed.
*Friday 6 June 1997: There was a general election in the Republic of Ireland. The ruling coalition government of Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left was defeated by a coalition of Fianna Fáil, Progressive Democrats, and independent members. Sinn Féin won its first seat in the Dáil Éireann, since it had ended its policy of abstentionism in 1986.
*16 June 1997 Two members of the RUC, Roland John Graham and David Johnston, murdered in Lurgan.
*Wednesday 25 June 1997: The British and Irish governments gave the IRA 5 weeks to call an unequivocal ceasefire. 6 weeks later Sinn Féin would be allowed into the talks (due to resume on 15 September).
*Sunday 6 July 1997: The Orange Order parade at Drumcree was again permitted to go ahead, after a large operation by the RUC and British Army. This was followed by violent protests in nationalist areas.
*Saturday 12 July 1997: After an earlier decision by the Orange Order to reroute seven of their marches, the Twelfth parades across Northern Ireland passed off peacefully.
*Wednesday 16 July 1997: The DUP and the UKUP left the Stormont talks in protest at what they claimed was a lack of clarification by the British government on decommissioning.
*Friday 18 July 1997: John Hume and Gerry Adams issued a joint statement. Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness called on the IRA to renew its ceasefire.
*Saturday 19 July 1997: The IRA announced the renewal of its 1994 ceasefire as of 12.00pm on 20 July 1997.

===Towards agreement===
*Tuesday 26 August 1997: The British and Irish governments jointly signed an agreement to set up an Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD). U2 held a concert at Botanic Gardens, in Belfast, with an audience of around 40,000.
*Friday 29 August 1997: The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Marjorie Mowlam, accepted the IRA ceasefire as genuine and invited Sinn Féin into the multi-party talks at Stormont.
*Tuesday 9 September 1997: Representatives of Sinn Féin entered Stormont to sign a pledge that the party would abide by the Mitchell Principles.
*Thursday 11 September 1997: The IRA said that they &quot;would have problems with sections of the Mitchell Principles&quot;, but that what Sinn Féin decided to do &quot;was a matter for them&quot;.
*Thursday 11 September 1997: The Belfast Telegraph published the first of two articles over two days with results of a survey it conducted with Queens College. Survey questions were developed in cooperation with the leading parties in Northern Ireland. Ninety-two per cent of respondents (86 per cent of Protestants and 98 per cent of Catholics) said they wanted the party they support to stay in the Stormont talks.
*Monday 15 September 1997: Multi-Party Talks resumed. The Ulster Unionist Party, the Progressive Unionist Party, and the Ulster Democratic Party instead attended a special meeting at the UUP headquarters, and re-entered the talks on Wednesday.
*Wednesday 24 September 1997: Procedures were agreed at the Multi-party Talks, decommissioning of paramilitary weapons was sidestepped, and the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning was formally launched.
*Tuesday 7 October 1997: Substantive talks began at Stormont.
*Friday 17 October 1997: The Parades Commission was announced. Its membership and powers attracted criticism from unionists.
*Thursday 6 November 1997: Around 12 members of Sinn Féin resigned in protest at the acceptance of the Mitchell Principles.
*Sunday 9 November 1997: During a radio interview on the tenth anniversary of the Enniskillen bomb which killed 11 people on 8 November 1987, Gerry Adams said he was &quot;deeply sorry about what happened&quot;.
*Saturday 27 December 1997: Inside the Maze Prison, members of the Irish National Liberation Army shot and killed Billy Wright, the Loyalist Volunteer Force leader.
*Saturday 10 January 1998: &quot;The Belfast Telegraph&quot; published the first of four stories over four days with results of an opinion survey it had conducted with Queens University. Questions were developed in cooperation with the major parties in Northern Ireland. Seventy per cent of Protestants said the most important step to ensure lasting peace would be to disband paramilitary groups; 78 per cent of Catholics said the most important step towards a lasting peace would be a bill of right guaranteeing equality for all.
*Friday 23 January 1998: The Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF), a cover name for the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), reinstated their ceasefire. This was taken as an admission that they had been responsible for the murders of several Catholics.
*Monday 26 January 1998: The talks moved to Lancaster House in London. The UDP were barred from the talks, following UFF/UDA involvement in three more murders. The governments stated that the UDP could re-enter the talks if the UFF maintained its renewed ceasefire.
*Thursday 29 January 1998: Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, announced a new inquiry into &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot; in Derry on 30 January 1972. This inquiry became known as the Saville Inquiry. The previous inquiry was widely regarded as a whitewash.
*Friday 20 February 1998: The British and Irish governments announced a 17-day exclusion of Sinn Féin from the talks because of IRA involvement in two killings in Belfast on 9 and 10 February 1998. Sinn Féin organised street protests over their exclusion.
*Monday 23 March 1998: Sinn Féin agreed to rejoin the talks, following the expiry of their exclusion a fortnight before, on 9 March.
*Tuesday 31 March 1998: &quot;The Belfast Telegraph&quot; published the first of four article over four days reporting results of a survey they conducted with Queens University. Survey questions were developed in cooperation with the leading parties in Northern Ireland. Seventy-seven per cent of respondents (74 per cent of Protestants and 81 per cent of Catholics) said they would vote &#x27;yes&#x27; for an agreement supported by a majority of the political parties taking part in the talks.
*Wednesday 25 March 1998: The chairman of the talks, Senator George Mitchell, set a two-week deadline for an agreement.
*Friday 3 April 1998: The Bloody Sunday Inquiry, chaired by Lord Saville, an English Law Lord, opened.
*Thursday 9 April 1998: Talks continued past the midnight deadline. Jeffrey Donaldson, who had been a member of the Ulster Unionist Party talks team walked out, causing speculation about a split in the party.
*Good Friday, 10 April 1998: At 5.30pm (over 17 hours after the deadline) George Mitchell stated: &quot;I am pleased to announce that the two governments and the political parties in Northern Ireland have reached agreement&quot;. It emerged later that President Clinton of the USA had made a number of telephone calls to party leaders to encourage them to reach this agreement.
*Saturday 15 August 1998: Omagh bombing by the Real IRA resulted in 29 deaths and hundreds of injuries. It was the single worst incident in Northern Ireland during the conflict.

The agreement, known as the Good Friday Agreement, included a devolved, inclusive government, prisoner release, troop reductions, targets for paramilitary decommissioning, provisions for polls on Irish reunification, and civil rights measures and &quot;parity of esteem&quot; for the two communities in Northern Ireland.

===The referendum campaign===
The agreement was to be approved by a referendum in Northern Ireland, and a separate referendum was to be held in the Republic to approve the necessary change to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution. The people of the Republic overwhelmingly endorsed the agreement, but the campaign in Northern Ireland was more controversial, and the result less predictable. The referendums were held on the same day, 22 May 1998.

The pro-agreement campaign framed the question as progress versus stalemate, as a struggle between intolerant bigots with no solutions on the one hand, and moderates with a constructive way forward on the other. The agreement was promoted to the nationalist community as delivering civil rights, inclusive government, recognition of their Irishness, and a peaceful route to Irish reunification. To the unionist community, it was presented as bringing an end to the troubles, a guaranteed end to paramilitaries and their weapons, and a guarantee of the Union for the foreseeable future. There was a massive government-funded campaign for the &quot;Yes&quot; vote, with large posters posted across Northern Ireland. One such poster featured five handwritten &quot;pledges&quot; by Prime Minister Tony Blair in an attempt to obtain the unionist &quot;Yes&quot; vote – this is despite the fact that none of the wording from these &quot;pledges&quot; was actually contained within the agreement that was being put to the electorate. These &quot;pledges&quot; were:

*No change to the status of Northern Ireland without the express consent of the people
*The power to take decisions to be returned from London to Northern Ireland, with accountable north–south co-operation
*Fairness and equality for all
*Those who use or threaten violence to be excluded from the government of Northern Ireland
*Prisoners to be kept in prison unless violence is given up for good

On the republican side, the &quot;No&quot; campaign seemed to concentrate on the purity of the republican ideal of complete and absolute independence from Britain. In this view, any compromise, however temporary, on the goal of Irish unity (or the right to pursue the armed struggle) was depicted as a betrayal of those who had fought and died for Ireland. Decommissioning of weapons and an end to paramilitary activity was portrayed as surrender to the British. The principle of consent was represented as a unionist veto, as it meant political progress would be almost impossible without unionist participation. It was pointed out that the agreement accepted partition. The state and its institutions would remain hostile to the republican community, claimed the critics. Despite these misgivings, the vast majority of republicans voted yes, with only some tiny unrepresentative parties (such as Republican Sinn Féin) on the nationalist side advocating a No vote.

On the unionist side, the &quot;No&quot; campaign was much stronger and stressed what were represented as concessions to republicanism and terrorism, particularly the release of convicted paramilitaries from prison (often those who had killed friends and relatives of unionist politicians and were serving &quot;life&quot; sentences), the presence of &quot;terrorists&quot; (by which they meant Sinn Féin) in government, the lack of guarantees on decommissioning, the perceived one-way nature of the process in moving towards a united Ireland, the lack of trust in all those who would be implementing the agreement, the erosion of British identity, the destruction of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the vague language of the agreement, and the rushed nature in which the agreement was written.

It was widely expected that the nationalist community would endorse the agreement. As the vote approached, unionist opinion appeared divided into those who supported the agreement, those who opposed the agreement on principle, and those who welcomed agreement, but still had major misgivings about aspects like prisoner release and the role of paramilitaries and parties associated with them (particularly Sinn Féin). The fear among the Agreement&#x27;s supporters was that there would not be a majority (or only a slim majority) of the unionist community in favour of the agreement, and that its credibility would be thereby undermined.

===The votes===
In the Republic of Ireland, the results of the vote to change the constitution in line with the agreement were:
In Northern Ireland, the results of the vote on the agreement were:
There is no official breakdown of how the nationalist and unionist communities voted, but CAIN, the Conflict Archive on the Internet, estimated that the overwhelming majority (up to 97%) of members of the largely Catholic nationalist community in Northern Ireland voted &#x27;Yes&#x27;. Their estimate of the largely Protestant unionist community&#x27;s support for the agreement was between 51 and 53 per cent.

Complicating matters for the calculation was the turnout, with a substantial increase over elections in many traditionally unionist areas, whilst the turnout was close to that for elections in staunch nationalist areas. Approximately 147,000 more people voted in the referendum than in the subsequent Assembly elections, though it is estimated that there was also some deliberate abstentions by hardline republican voters.

The referendum was calculated centrally so it is not clear what the geographic spread of voting was, but an exit poll found that out of all eighteen constituencies, only Ian Paisley&#x27;s North Antrim stronghold voted against the Agreement.

The pro-agreement result was greeted at the time with relief by supporters of the agreement. However, the scale of sceptical and anti-agreement sentiment in the unionist community, their continued misgivings over aspects of the agreement, and differing expectations from the Agreement on the part of the two communities were to cause difficulties in the following years.

===Tensions and dissident threats===
Although the peace process initially progressed mostly trouble-free, tensions escalated in 2001 with increasing sectarian conflicts, rioting, political disagreements and the decommissioning process. Real IRA bombs at the BBC and a commercial district in London threatened to derail the peace process. The Holy Cross dispute in north Belfast starting in June 2001 would become a major episode of sectarian conflict. Widespread rioting occurred in July, and that same month the loyalist Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF) pulled out of the Good Friday Agreement whilst the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) withdrew from the &quot;current phase&quot; of the peace process. On 26 July two hardline Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) MPs, David Burnside and Jeffrey Donaldson, both called for their party&#x27;s withdrawal of supporting the new power-sharing Stormont assembly.

Much of the disturbances are thought to have been caused by the alienation of loyalists in the years following the Good Friday Agreement, who increasingly feared that the Agreement was largely in the Catholics&#x27; favour and that Irish unity was inevitable. Northern Ireland Secretary John Reid told unionists in a speech that they are &quot;wrong&quot; to think so, and that the Agreement would be a failure if Protestants no longer felt at home. The number of loyalist paramilitary shootings increased from 33 at the time of the Agreement to a peak of 124 in 2001/02.

On 9 September 2001 a gang of 15 Provisional IRA members kidnapped, tortured and shot two youths. Major loyalist rioting and violence broke out amid the Holy Cross dispute on 27 September. The next day, journalist Martin O&#x27;Hagan was killed by Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) members. On 13 October 2001, Reid declared the ceasefires of two loyalist paramilitary groups, Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and the LVF, to be over due to their violent shooting and rioting incidents. Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams urged the Provisional IRA to disarm amid Stormont&#x27;s near-collapse. In December 2001, two army watchtowers were attacked in South Armagh by republicans that caused many injuries. Throughout 2002 rioting and sectarian clashes continued, the most tense incident being the clashes in Short Strand.

On 6 May 2002 Progressive Unionist Party politician David Ervine said that continuing violence, doubts among loyalists and uncertainty about the IRA has left the peace process in a &quot;substantial and serious crisis&quot;. On 14 October 2002, the Northern Ireland Assembly was suspended and direct rule from Westminster imposed.

===Implementation===
*The Northern Ireland Assembly made a good start. However, it was suspended several times mainly because of unionist anger at the IRA&#x27;s refusal to decommission their weapons &quot;transparently&quot;. Elections carried on nonetheless and voting polarised towards the more radical parties – the DUP and Sinn Féin. In 2004, negotiations were held to attempt to re-establish the Assembly and the Executive. These negotiations failed but the governments believed they were very close to a deal and published their proposed deal as the Comprehensive Agreement. 
*Although the Royal Ulster Constabulary was renamed as the Police Service of Northern Ireland on 4 November 2001, Sinn Féin, the second-largest party, did not declare its acceptance of the Police Service of Northern Ireland until 28 January 2007 as part of the St Andrews Agreement. A 2005 survey indicates that 83% of the Northern Ireland population have &quot;some&quot;, &quot;a lot&quot;, or &quot;total&quot; confidence in the police&#x27;s ability to provide a day-to-day policing service.
*No IRA weapons were decommissioned until October 2001, and the final consignment to be &quot;put beyond use&quot; was announced on 26 September 2005. There has also been allegations of IRA involvement in espionage at the Stormont Assembly (which prompted the UUP to collapse the Assembly), in training the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerillas, in several high-profile murders, and allegations of major robberies such as that of approximately £1 million of goods from a wholesaler and in excess of £26 million in the Northern Bank robbery.

===Endgame===
In January 2005, Robert McCartney was murdered after a pub brawl by IRA members. After a high-profile campaign by his sisters and fiancée, the IRA admitted its members were responsible and offered to meet them. The McCartney sisters turned down their offer, but the episode badly damaged the standing of the IRA in Belfast.

In April 2005, Gerry Adams called for the IRA to lay down its weapons. It agreed on 28 July 2005 calling for its volunteers to use &quot;exclusively peaceful means&quot;. It would not disband, but simply use peaceful means to achieve its aims.
*Apart from some worn pistols from the Loyalist Volunteer Force, no other loyalist paramilitary group has decommissioned any of their weapons, and all have been involved in several murders, including major feuds, both internal and with other loyalist groups. Most Unionists maintain that the loyalist refusal is less of a stumbling block to the restoration of the assembly because, unlike the Provisional Irish Republican Army, parties with formal links to loyalist paramilitary groups do not have significant elected representation within the Assembly, despite their high levels of support. Throughout their existence, loyalist paramilitaries have been described by some (including Taoiseach Albert Reynolds) as &quot;reactionary&quot;, i.e., that they respond to the attacks of republican groups, and some commentators claim that if there were no violent republican activity, loyalist violence would cease to exist. Others contend that these claims of solely &quot;reactionary&quot; loyalist attacks are hard to square with the emergence of militant loyalism in the civil rights era (i.e., when the IRA was dormant), and their preference for attacks on Catholics with no paramilitary connections, rather than attacking the more dangerous members of republican organisations. In the event that full transparent decommissioning by republican paramilitaries is completed, then it is widely expected by political commentators that loyalist paramilitary organisations would be put under heavy pressure to follow suit.
*While killings and bombings have been &quot;almost&quot; eliminated, &quot;lower level&quot; violence and crime, including &quot;punishment&quot; beatings, extortion and drug dealing continue, particularly in loyalist areas. Paramilitary organisations are still perceived to have considerable control in some areas, particularly the less affluent. Details of the perceived current level of activity by paramilitary organisations were published in a 2005 report by the Independent Monitoring Commission.

On 28 July 2005, the IRA announced the end of its armed campaign, and committed to the complete decommissioning of all its weapons, which was to be witnessed by both Catholic and Protestant clergymen. The statement was first read by veteran IRA militant Séanna Walsh in a video released to the public and contained the following text:

The IICD confirmed in its final report of September 2005 that the IRA had decommissioned all of its weapons.

The definitive end of The Troubles and thus of the Peace Process came in 2007. Following the St Andrews Agreement of October 2006, and March 2007 elections, the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Féin formed a government in May 2007. In July 2007, the British Army formally ended Operation Banner, their mission in Northern Ireland which began 38 years earlier, in 1969.

On 8 December 2007, while visiting President Bush in the White House with the Northern Ireland First Minister Ian Paisley, Martin McGuinness, the Deputy First Minister, said to the press &quot;Up until the 26 March this year, Ian Paisley and I never had a conversation about anything – not even about the weather – and now we have worked very closely together over the last seven months and there&#x27;s been no angry words between us. ... This shows we are set for a new course.&quot;

===Consultative Group on the Past===
The Consultative Group on the Past was an independent group established to consult across the community in Northern Ireland on the best way to deal with the legacy of the Troubles.

The Group stated its terms of reference as:
The Group was co-chaired by the Most Rev. Dr. Robin Eames (Lord Eames), the former Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh, and Denis Bradley, and published its report in January 2009.

Whilst the group met MI5 and the UVF, the Provisional IRA refused to meet with the group.

The Group published its recommendations on 28 January 2009 in a 190-page report, containing more than 30 recommendations, expected to cost in total £300m. The report recommended setting up a 5-year Legacy Commission, a Reconciliation Forum to aid the existing commission for victims and survivors, and a new historical case review body. The report concluded the Legacy Commission should make proposals on how &quot;a line might be drawn&quot;, but omitted proposals for an amnesty. Additionally, it was proposed that no new Public Inquiries be held, and an annual Day of Reflection and Reconciliation and a shared memorial to the conflict. A controversial proposal to pay the relatives of all victims killed in the Troubles, including the families of paramilitary members, £12,000, as a &quot;recognition payment&quot;, caused disruption to the report&#x27;s launch by protesters. This estimated cost of this part of the proposal was £40m.

<doc id="680340" wikidata="Q15623474" url="?curid=680340" title="Prime rate">
<text>The prime rate or prime lending rate is an interest rate used by banks, typically representing the rate at which they lend to their most creditworthy customers. Some variable interest rates may be expressed as a percentage above or below prime rate.

==Use in different banking systems==

===United States and Canada===
Historically, in North American banking, the prime rate represented actual interest rate charged to borrowers, although this is no longer universally true. The prime rate varies little among banks and adjustments are generally made by banks at the same time, although this does not happen frequently. , the prime rate was 7.50% in the United States and 5.20% in Canada.

In the United States, the prime rate runs approximately 300 basis points (or 3 percentage points) above the federal funds rate, which is the interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans made to fulfill reserve funding requirements. The federal funds rate plus a much smaller increment is frequently used for lending to the most creditworthy borrowers, as is LIBOR, the London Interbank Offered Rate. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets eight times per year to set a target for the federal funds rate.

Prior to December 17, 2008, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; followed a policy of changing its published prime rate when 23 out of 30 of the United States&#x27; largest banks changed their prime rates. Recognizing that fewer, larger banks now control most banking assets (that is, it is more concentrated), the &quot;Journal&quot; now publishes a rate reflecting the base rate posted by at least 70% of the top ten banks by assets.

===Malaysia===
Effective January 2, 2015, the Base Lending Rate (BLR) structure was replaced with a new Base Rate (BR) system. Under the BR system, which serves as the main reference rate for new retail floating rate loans, Malaysian banks can determine their interest rate based on a formula set by Bank Negara, Malaysia&#x27;s central bank.

Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) has set a group-wide base rate at 3.2%, effective Jan 2, 2015. All new retail loans and financing such as mortgages, unit trust loans, share margin financing, personal financing and overdraft facilities which are applied for by individual customers will be based on the base rate. Though certain banks may be setting a higher BR compared to others, they can sometimes offer lower ELR to customers in order to remain competitive. Loans approved and extended before January 2, 2015 continue to follow the old BLR until the end of their loan tenure.

==Uses==
The prime rate is used often as an index in calculating rate changes to adjustable-rate mortgages (ARM) and other variable rate short-term loans. It is used in the calculation of some private student loans. Many credit cards and home equity lines of credit with variable interest rates have their rate specified as the prime rate (index) plus a fixed value commonly called the spread or margin.

<doc id="680341" wikidata="Q2010561" url="?curid=680341" title="University of Buckingham">
<text>The University of Buckingham (UB) is a non-profit private university in Buckingham, England, and the oldest of the country&#x27;s six private universities. It was founded as the University College at Buckingham (UCB) in 1973, admitting its first students in 1976. It was granted university status by royal charter in 1983.

Buckingham was closely linked to Margaret Thatcher, who as Education Secretary oversaw the creation of the university college in 1973, and as Prime Minister was instrumental in elevating it to a university in 1983; thus creating the first private university in the UK since the establishment of the University Grants Committee in 1919. When she retired from politics in 1992, Margaret Thatcher became the university&#x27;s second chancellor, a post she held until 1998. Buckingham&#x27;s finances for teaching operate entirely on student fees and endowments; it does not receive direct state funding (via the Office for Students or Research England) although its students can receive student loans from the Student Loans Company. It has formal charity status as a not-for-profit institution dedicated to the ends of research and education.

== History ==

Some of the founding academics migrated from the University of Oxford, disillusioned or wary of aspects of the late-1960s ethos. On 27 May 1967, &quot;The Times&quot; published a letter from J. W. Paulley, a physician, who wrote: Three London conferences followed which explored this idea.

The university was incorporated as the &quot;University College of Buckingham&quot; in 1976 and received its royal charter as a university from the Queen in 1983. As of May 2016, it is the only private university in the UK with a royal charter.

Its development was influenced by the Institute of Economic Affairs, in particular, Harry Ferns and Ralph Harris, heads of the institute. The university&#x27;s foundation-stone was laid by Margaret Thatcher, who became the university&#x27;s chancellor between 1993 and 1998.

The university&#x27;s vice-chancellors have been: Lord Beloff, former Gladstone Professor of Politics at the University of Oxford; Alan Peacock, founder of the economics department at the University of York and Fellow of the British Academy; Michael Barrett; Richard Luce, now Lord Luce, former Minister for the Arts; Robert Taylor; Terence Kealey; Anthony Seldon and James Tooley.

From 2004, students at Buckingham have been eligible for government student loans, which led to an increase in UK students at the university.

==Campus==
Near the centre of the town of Buckingham is the riverside campus, which is partly contained within a south-turning bend of the River Great Ouse. Here, on or just off Hunter Street, are some of the university&#x27;s central buildings: Yeomanry House; the Anthony de Rothschild building (which contains Humanities); the Humanities Library; and also some of the student accommodation, looking northwards across the river. Prebend House, a recently restored Georgian house, contains the Vice-Chancellor&#x27;s office. On the other side of Hunter Street, on the so-called &#x27;island&#x27;, is the Tanlaw Mill, one of the university&#x27;s social centres; with the main refectory, the Fitness Centre, and the Students&#x27; Union Office.

Overlooking this site, on the hill above, is the extensive Chandos Building. This complex contains the Medical School. It also houses the Ian-Fairburn Lecture Theatre, the largest lecture theatre on the river-side site.

Further on, up the hill, on the London Road, is another element of the campus, in particular the schools of Law and Computing, which is housed in the Franciscan Building, surrounded by other student accommodation blocks. This is opposite the swimming pool and leisure centre. The university has been expanding in recent years. It has acquired a new site on the west side of the river, which will increase the capacity of the river-side campus as a whole. 

==Organisation and governance==
===Chancellor===

On 24 February 2020, Dame Mary Archer was installed as chancellor of the university.

Former chancellors were Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone (from 1973 to 1993), Baroness Margaret Thatcher (from 1993 to 1998), Martin Jacomb (from 1999 to 2010), Lord Tanlaw (from 2010 to 2013), and Lady Keswick (from 2014 to 2020).

===Vice-chancellor===
Since October 2020, the vice-chancellor is Professor James Tooley.

==Academic profile==

===Teaching===
The university&#x27;s schools (faculties) are: Business, Computing, Education, Humanities and Social Sciences, Law, Medicine, Postgraduate Medicine and Allied Health, Psychology, and the Foundation Department. Each of these is presided over by a dean.

The quality of the university&#x27;s provision is maintained, as at other UK universities, by an external examiner system (i.e., professors from other universities oversee and report on exams and marking), by an academic advisory council (comprising a range of subject-specialist academics from other universities), and by membership of the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA).

The university was created as a liberal arts college, and still describes itself as such, although in an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2003, then-vice-chancellor Terence Kealey remarked that it had &quot;become a vocational school for law and business for non-British students, because that&#x27;s where the market has taken us&quot;. Consequently, major humanities subjects such as history and politics are no longer offered as stand-alone degrees, instead being combined with economics as a degree in international studies. Economics, however, is available as a stand-alone degree as is English literature, as a single honours subject, and in combinations with English Language, or Journalism, and related areas. 

Some degree programmes at Buckingham, Law for example, place greater emphasis on exams as an assessment method rather than coursework, but in general its degree programmes balance assessment between exams and coursework.

===School of Medicine===
The Medical School offers a 4.5 year MB ChB medical degree, accredited by the General Medical Council. Other medical courses are offered in the School of Postgraduate Medicine and Allied Health. The school opened in 2015 as the first private medical school in the UK (since the establishment of the UGC in 1919), in partnership with the Milton Keynes NHS Foundation Trust.

====&quot;Alternative&quot; medicine====
The university ran a diploma course in &quot;integrated medicine&quot; that was later withdrawn under pressure from David Colquhoun, a campaigner against pseudoscience and alternative medicine. The Dean of the School, Karol Sikora, was a Foundation Fellow of Prince Charles&#x27;s now-defunct alternative medicine lobby group, The Prince&#x27;s Foundation for Integrated Health, and is Chair of the &quot;Faculty of Integrated Medicine&quot;, which is unaffiliated with any university but also includes Rosy Daniel and Mark Atkinson, who co-ordinated Buckingham&#x27;s &quot;integrated medicine&quot; course. Daniel has been criticised by David Colquhoun for breaches of the Cancer Act 1939, regarding claims she made for Carctol, a herbal dietary supplement with no utility in treating cancer. Andrew Miles is on the scientific council of the &quot;College of Medicine&quot; an alternative medicine lobby group linked to the then Prince of Wales. Sikora is also a &quot;professional member&quot; of this organisation. The degree was stripped of validation by the University of Buckingham prior to the first graduation.

===School of Postgraduate Medicine and Allied Health===
Postgraduate medical courses and non-clinical allied health courses are offered in a separate school from the clinical medical degree. The School of Postgradaute Medicine and Allied Health offers postgraduate Master of Surgery and Master of Medicine programmes aimed at overseas-qualified doctors preparing for the General Medical Council&#x27;s Professional and Linguistic Assessments Board in order to practice in the UK.

===School of Education===
The Department of Education has two aspects, research and vocational: it conducts research into education and school provision, and also maintains various PGCE courses for teacher training. The Department of Education has been home to some of the most prominent educationalists in Britain, including the late Chris Woodhead (former head of Ofsted) and Anthony O&#x27;Hear (director of the Royal Institute of Philosophy). Its postgraduate certificate in education – which deals with both the state and the independent sector – is accredited with Qualified Teacher Status which means that it also qualifies graduates to teach in the state sector.

===School of Business===
The University of Buckingham has a business school which offers a range of undergraduate and postgraduate qualifications for students.

The dean of the school is Debarpita Bardhan-Correia. A range of undergraduate and postgraduate business, entrepreneurship, accounting and finance degrees are offered by the Business School.

There are a number of lecturers including many BLEU (Buckingham Lean Enterprise Unit) certified ones, which are individuals who have completed a MSc with the university since 1999. There are also a number of lecturers who are CIM certified.

====Vinson Centre for Economics and Entrepreneurship====
On 28 November 2018 the University of Buckingham opened the Vinson Building, a multi-purposed facility for use by Buckingham&#x27;s students and the local community. The university&#x27;s Business Enterprise undergraduates and businesses that are members of Buckinghamshire Business First use the Buckingham Enterprise Hub, which is located in the Vinson Building.

===Degrees===
The university offers traditional degrees over a shorter than usual time-frame. Students at Buckingham study for eight terms over two years, rather than nine terms over three, which (with extra teaching) fits a three-year degree into two years. (The MBChB course lasts 4.5 years.)

Because Buckingham&#x27;s degrees take two years to complete, students view its degrees as cost-effective compared to other UK university courses, once the income from an extra year&#x27;s employment is taken into account. In some subject areas, notably Humanities, the university is now offering its degrees over different time-scales, i.e., the 2-year &#x27;intensive&#x27; model, working the extra summer term per year, and the traditional 3-year model with the usual summer break each year.

===External degrees and validation===
The university awards undergraduate and graduate (Masters/MBA) degrees to students who have studied at the Sarajevo School of Science and Technology.

The university validated courses in medicine at Medipathways College, a small private college based in London. Medipathways operates dentistry and medicine courses. In late 2014 Medipathways was found by the Higher Education Quality Assurance Agency &#x27;to be at serious risks of failure&#x27;; the university disagreed with the assessment. The company was wound up in September 2019.

===Research===
The Humanities Research Institute includes academics working in a range of disciplines, particularly military history, security studies, political history, the history of art, 19th-century literature and social history.

Alan Smithers runs the Centre for Education and Employment Research (CEER), from within the School of Humanities.

From the English department, John Drew runs Dickens Journals Online, the project which has put the whole of Dickens&#x27;s journalistic output on free-access on the web.

==Reputation and rankings==

The university was awarded the Times/Sunday Times University of the Year for Teaching Quality 2015–16 in 2015, at which time it ranked 38th in the Times/Sunday Times league table. The university is not listed in the Guardian University Guide. The Complete University Guide has seen a steady decline in Buckingham&#x27;s ranking, from 20th in 2011 to 107th in the 2020 table. The University of Buckingham had fallen again to 123rd out of 130 universities in the University League Tables 2022. It was ranked 17th for graduate employability in 2015. It was ranked joint second for student satisfaction in the 2018 National Student Survey, however a fall in satisfaction in the 2019 National Student Survey saw it fall out of the top ten.

===Departments===
The league tables of individual subjects in &quot;The Guardian University Guide 2020&quot;, produced by &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper, ranked Buckingham 10th (out of 101) for Accounting and Finance, 18th (out of 119) for Business Management and Marketing, 6th (out of 71) for Economics, 12th (out of 105) for English and Creative Writing, 28th (out of 101) for Law, and 51st (out of 116) for Psychology. It is noted as teaching Computer Science and Information Systems, History, History of Art, Medicine, and Politics, but not ranked in the subjects.

The subject league tables in the &quot;Complete University Guide 2020&quot; ranked Buckingham 79th for Accounting and Finance, 76th for Business &amp; Management, 82nd for Computer Science, 52nd for Economics, 73rd for English, 49th for Law, 73rd for Politics, and 92nd for Psychology. in 2022 Economics had fallen to 69th.

===Quality assurance===
Buckingham has been reviewed voluntarily by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA) from 2001. The QAA indicated it had &quot;limited confidence&quot; in the university&#x27;s management of academic standards in 2008, as the external academic advisory council had &quot;come to see itself as part of the Buckingham academic community&quot; and &quot;serious concerns about academic standards [had] been flagged by external examiners&quot;. The university was subsequently judged to &quot;meet UK expectations&quot; in its 2012 review. In 2015 the QAA found that Buckingham had failed to follow the university&#x27;s regulations on academic misconduct with respect to possible plagiarism by students. An &quot;alternative providers&quot; (i.e. private universities) review by the QAA in 2017 found again that Buckingham met UK expectations in all areas.

In June 2017 the university was judged by the Teaching Excellence Framework panel to be &quot;of the highest quality found in the UK&quot; and given a gold award.

In December 2022, England’s higher education regulator OfS (Office for Students) fined the university for publishing its 2019 audited accounts two years late, citing a &quot;“significant regulatory risk”. The auditors of the accounts noted &quot;“the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the group’s and the university’s ability to continue as a going concern”. The 2020 and 2021 accounts had to that date not been published.

==University of Buckingham Press==
The University of Buckingham Press publishes in the areas of law, education, and business through its journal articles, books, reports and other material. In 2006 the press relaunched The Denning Law Journal and it is now available in print and its whole archive is online.

It also publishes three other journals: &quot;The Buckingham Journal of Language and Linguistics&quot;, &quot;The Journal of Prediction Markets&quot;, and&quot; The Journal of Gambling Business and Economics&quot;. It has a co-publishing arrangement with Policy Exchange for its Foundations series.

==Notable alumni==
British alumni include Bader Ben Hirsi, playwright and director; The Rt Hon Brandon Lewis CBE, former MP for Great Yarmouth and former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland; Mark Lancaster, Lord Lancaster of Kimbolton, former Armed Forces minister; Graham Roos, appointed in 2011 as the university&#x27;s first Creative Artist in Residence; James Henderson (former CEO of Bell Pottinger); Michael Ellis, former MP for Northampton, former Minister for the Cabinet Office and former Paymaster General.

<text>Samuel Edgar Langford (March 4, 1886 – January 12, 1956) was a Canadian boxing standout of the early part of the 20th century. Called the &quot;Greatest Fighter Nobody Knows&quot;, by ESPN, Langford is considered by many boxing historians to be one of the greatest fighters of all time. Originally from Weymouth Falls, a small community in Nova Scotia, he was known as &quot;the Boston Bonecrusher&quot;, &quot;the Boston Terror&quot;, and his most famous nickname, &quot;the Boston Tar Baby&quot;. Langford stood and weighed in his prime. He fought from lightweight to heavyweight and defeated many world champions and legends of the time in each weight class. Considered a devastating puncher even at heavyweight, Langford was rated No. 2 by &quot;The Ring&quot; on their list of &quot;100 greatest punchers of all time&quot;. One boxing historian described Langford as &quot;experienced as a heavyweight James Toney with the punching power of Mike Tyson&quot;.

He was denied a shot at many World Championships, due to the colour bar and by the refusal of Jack Johnson, the first African-American World Heavyweight Champion, to fight him in a rematch. Langford was the World Colored Heavyweight Champion, a title vacated by Johnson after he won the World Championship, a record five times. Alongside this, Langford also defeated the reigning Lightweight Champion Joe Gans, the first African-American World Champion in boxing history and widely regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time, in a non-title bout. Many boxing aficionados consider Langford to be the greatest boxer not to have won a world title. On August 13, 2020, the WBC granted Langford to be an honorary world champion. BoxRec ranks him as the 22nd greatest Canadian boxer of all time.

==Early life==
Born in Nova Scotia, his grandfather was a former slave from the United States who helped settle Weymouth Falls. Langford left home as a youth to escape an abusive father. 

He made his way to Boston, Massachusetts where he eventually found work as a janitor in a boxing gymnasium at the Lenox Athletic Club. Not long after he started working he was sparring and improving his own boxing skills. He won the amateur featherweight championship of Boston at age 15.

==Professional career ==
Langford was a boxer who fought greats from the lightweight division right up to the heavyweights, beating many champions in the process. However, he was never able to secure a world title for himself. Despite the fact, Langford never received a chance to fight for Jack Johnson&#x27;s heavyweight title, &quot; Ring&quot; magazine founder Nat Fleischer rated Langford as one of the ten best heavyweights of all time. Renowned champion Jack Dempsey claimed that as a young boxer in 1916 he refused a fight with Langford. According to Dempsey: &quot;I think Sam Langford was the greatest fighter we ever had.&quot;

== Significant fights ==
Langford&#x27;s most memorable fights were his numerous encounters against fellow Black boxers Sam McVey, Battling Jim Johnson, Joe Jeanette and Harry Wills, who all experienced similar barriers in their fighting careers.

Langford defeated World Lightweight Champion Joe Gans on December 8, 1903, via a 15-round decision. Gans&#x27; title was not on the line, however. The two would later become good friends. Langford considered Gans the pound-for-pound greatest fighter of all time.

He fought Jack Blackburn, trainer of the legendary Joe Louis, six times. The first three fights were draws, the fourth a decision win for Langford, the fifth another draw and the sixth a no contest.

Although Langford is often credited as the greatest fighter to never challenge for a world title, he fought World Welterweight Champion Barbados Joe Walcott on September 5, 1904, for his title. The fight resulted in a draw via decision, thus Walcott retained his title. However, reports of the fight say Langford clearly outpointed the champion. Langford kept Walcott at a distance with his longer reach and used his footwork to evade all of Walcott&#x27;s attacks. Langford landed lefts and rights to the jaw so effectively, Walcott was bleeding by round two and continued bleeding more after every round. Walcott was brought on one knee in the third round and the fight ended with hardly a scratch on Langford.

In 1912, Langford was one of the contenders for the World Colored Heavyweight Championship fought at various venues across Australia. Sam McVey his opponent, McVey ranked alongside Jack Johnson, Joe Jeanette, Sam Langford, and Harry Wills as the top black heavyweights of their generation. Prior to his win, Langford stayed at the Nedlands Park Hotel where he:

Langford fought various contenders throughout his career. He fought welterweight Young Peter Jackson six times, winning the first two by decision, the third was a draw via points, losing the fourth by technical knockout and winning the fifth and sixth bouts again by decision. Their bout on November 12, 1907, at the Pacific Athletic Club in Los Angeles was billed as being for the World Colored Middleweight Championship (158  lbs.). Langford won the title by besting Jackson on points in the 20-round bout.

Langford fought heavyweight Joe Jeanette fourteen times, losing the first by eighth-round retirement, winning second by decision, third and fourth were a draw via points, winning the fifth through eighth by decision, ninth was a draw via points, winning the tenth on the decision, eleventh was a draw via points, lost the twelfth by decision and winning the thirteenth by seventh-round knock out and fourteenth by decision (total: 8 wins (1 KO), 2 losses (1 RT and 1 PTS) and 4 draws).

He fought future World Heavyweight Champion Jack Johnson on April 26, 1906, losing by a fifteenth-round decision. Johnson was 29 pounds heavier than Langford. Langford took severe punishment and was knocked down 3 times; however, he lasted the 15 round distance. After winning their first match, Johnson repeatedly refused rematches against Langford, who was considered by some to be the most dangerous challenger for Johnson&#x27;s crown, although Johnson cited Langford&#x27;s inability to meet his $30,000 appearance fee.

Langford fought heavyweight Fireman Jim Flynn six times, winning the first by first-round knockout, losing the second by decision, winning the third by eighth-round knockout, winning the fourth by decision, winning the fifth by third-round knockout, and winning the sixth by decision.

Winner of the World Colored Middleweight Championship in 1907 when he beat Young Peter Jackson, he fought World Middleweight Champion Stanley Ketchel on April 27, 1910, in a six-round non-title fight, a no-decision draw. A longer rematch bout was rumoured but never happened due to Ketchell&#x27;s murder six months later.

Langford fought heavyweight Battling Jim Johnson twelve times, winning the first three by decision, fourth and fifth were a draw via points, winning the sixth and seventh on points, eighth by twelfth-round knockout, ninth through eleventh by points, and drawing in the twelfth via points (total: 9 wins (1 KO), 0 losses and 3 draws). Johnson was always heavier than Langford by 26–40 pounds.

Langford fought heavyweight Sam McVea fifteen times, drawing in the first via points, losing the second by decision, winning the third and fourth by decision, winning the fifth by technical knockout (McVea claimed a foul; this was not allowed and he refused to continue), winning the sixth by thirteenth-round knockout, seventh was a draw via points, losing the eighth by decision, ninth through eleventh were draws via points, winning the twelfth by decision, thirteenth and fourteenth were draws via decision and winning the fifteenth by decision (total: 6 wins (2 KO), 2 losses (0 KO) and 7 draws). Langford was 37 years old in the final bout.

Langford defeated former World Light Heavyweight Champion Philadelphia Jack O&#x27;Brien on August 15, 1911, by fifth-round technical knockout. Langford outweighed O&#x27;Brien by ten pounds. The fight was stopped after a hard left hook put O&#x27;Brien on the canvas. O&#x27;Brien had to be helped to his corner. The poetic O&#x27;Brien later said of Langford, &quot;When he appeared upon the scene of combat, you knew you were cooked.&quot;

Langford fought heavyweight Gunboat Smith twice, losing the first by decision (many ring siders were surprised) and winning the second by third-round knockout.

Langford fought heavyweight Harry Wills seventeen times. Langford was 31 in the first bout and continued to suffer from old age and failing eyesight more and more each fight. The first was a draw via points, the second a win via fourteenth-round knockout, the third and fourth losses via decision, the fifth a win via nineteenth-round knockout, the sixth through ninth losses via decision, the tenth a draw via points, the eleventh a loss via sixth-round knockout and the twelfth by seventh-round technical knockout, the thirteenth through seventeenth by decision (total: 2 wins (2 KO), 14 losses (2 KO) and 2 draws).

Former World Heavyweight Champion Tommy Burns was a referee in the third fight. At the end, he caught Langford&#x27;s hand and said to him, &quot;Sam, this is the hardest I ever had to do in my life. I always admired you and never thought to see you beaten, but I have to give the decision against you.&quot;

== World Welterweight title fight ==
Although Langford is often credited as the greatest fighter to never challenge for a world title, he fought World Welterweight Champion Barbados Joe Walcott, a black man, on September 5, 1904, at Lake Massabesic Coliseum in Manchester, New Hampshire for his title. Both fighters weighed in at 142 lbs.

The fight resulted in a draw via decision, thus Walcott retained his title. However, reports of the fight say Langford clearly outpointed the champion. Langford kept Walcott at a distance with his longer reach and used his footwork to evade all of Walcott&#x27;s attacks. Langford landed lefts and rights to the jaw so effectively, Walcott was bleeding by round two and continued bleeding more after every round. Walcott was brought on one knee in the third round and the fight ended with hardly a scratch on Langford.

The &quot;Boston Globe&quot; newspaper reported:

&quot;Joe Walcott met his match in a 15-round bout yesterday afternoon in the Massabesic coliseum before a crowd of 1200. His opponent was Sam Langford, who clearly outpointed the champion, and the latter&#x27;s aggressiveness in carrying the fight to Langford was all that saved him from taking a decision that would have given him the short end of the purse. Langford took advantage of his longer reach and repeatedly played a tattoo on Walcott&#x27;s face, and his cleverness on his feet carried him away from harm a score or more times when Walcott endeavored by sheer brute force to deliver a knockout blow. While Walcott was the aggressor, Langford met his attacks by left and right [sic] to the jaw and mouth so effectively as to draw blood in the second round and he kept Walcott bleeding in every round thereafter. In the third round, Langford brought the champion to one knee by a straight away jolt to the jaw, and he went through the entire fifteen rounds without a perceptible scratch on himself. In the opening round honors were even, but thereafter until the seventh round Langford had all the better of the argument.&quot;

== World Colored Heavyweight Championship ==

Sam Langford won the World Colored Heavyweight Championship a record five times between 1910 and 1918. Jack Johnson had reigned as the World Colored Heavyweight Champion from 1903 to 1908, when he relinquished the title after winning the World Heavyweight Championship. Joe Jeanette and Sam McVey fought in Paris in February 1909 to fill the vacant title, with McVey the victor. Jeanette took the title away from McVey two months later.

Subsequently, Langford claimed the title during Jeanette&#x27;s reign after Johnson refused to defend the World Heavyweight Championship against him. For a year there were two duelling claimants to the world-coloured heavyweight crown, Jeanette, the &quot;official&quot; champ, and Langford, the pretender, the man whom Jack Johnson &quot;ducked&quot;. On September 6, 1910, in Boston, Massachusetts, Langford became the undisputed coloured champ by winning a 15-round bout with Jeanette on points. Still, Jack Johnson refused to give him a title shot.

== Failure to secure title shot ==

Langford had lost to Jack Johnson the only time they had fought, on April 26, 1906, in a fifteen-round decision. Johnson was 29  lbs. heavier than Langford, and though he knocked down Langford in the sixth round, many spectators felt Langford had won the bout, even though Sam was on the verge of going down several times only for Johnson to hold him up and prevent a knockdown. In truth, Johnson actually toyed with him, carrying on conversations with ringsiders all through the fight. After winning their first match, Johnson repeatedly refused rematches against Langford, who was considered by some to be the most dangerous challenger for Johnson&#x27;s crown. Another explanation for this Johnson&#x27;s refusal is that he knew that a fight between two black fighters would not generate nearly as much revenue as a fight between him and a white man.

Battling Jim Johnson, the man Sam fought twelve times, beating Johnson nine times and never losing once, would be the one who got the title shot against Johnson that Langford had rightly believed his.

=== World Heavyweight Championship ===
Ironically, the colour bar that had marred the world heavyweight title by blackballing boxers of colour remained in force even under Jack Johnson. Once he was the World&#x27;s Heavyweight Champion, Johnson did not fight a black opponent for the first five years of his reign. In addition to Langford, he denied matches to black heavyweights Joe Jeanette and to the young Harry Wills (who was Colored Heavyweight Champion during the last year of Johnson&#x27;s reign as World Heavyweight Champion).

Blacks were not given a shot at the title allegedly because Johnson felt that he could make more money fighting white boxers. In August 1913, as Johnson neared the end of his troubled reign as World Heavyweight Champion, there were rumours that he had agreed to fight Langford in Paris for the title, but it came to naught. Johnson claimed that Langford was unable to raise $30,000 (equivalent to approximately $ in today&#x27;s funds) for his guarantee.

Because black boxers with the exception of Johnson had been barred from fighting for the heavyweight championship because of racism, Johnson&#x27;s refusal to fight African-Americans offended the African-American community, since the opportunity to fight top white boxers was rare. Jeanette criticized Johnson, saying, &quot;Jack forgot about his old friends after he became champion and drew the colour line against his own people.&quot;

When Johnson finally did agree to take on a black opponent in late 1913, it was not Sam Langford, the current Colored Heavyweight Champion, that he gave the title shot to. Instead, Johnson chose Battling Jim Johnson, a mediocrity who, in 1910, had lost to Langford and had a draw and loss via knockout to Sam McVey, another former Colored Champion. Battling Jim fought fellow former Colored Champion Joe Jeanette four times between July 19, 1912, and January 21, 1912, and lost all four fights. The only fighter of note he did beat in that period was future Colored Champion Big Bill Tate, whom he knocked out in the second round of a scheduled 10-round bout. It was Tate&#x27;s third pro fight.

The fight, scheduled for 10 rounds, was held on December 19, 1913, in Paris. It was the first time in history that two blacks had fought for the World Heavyweight Championship. While the Johnson v. Johnson fight had been billed as a World Heavyweight title match, in many ways, it resembled an exhibition. A sportswriter from the &quot;Indianapolis Star&quot; reported that the fight crowd became unruly when it was apparent that neither boxer was putting up a fight.&quot; The champ barely engaged Battling Jim, and it turned out he had broken his arm during the third round, a distinct disadvantage that Battling Jim failed to capitalize on. The fight was a draw, and Jack Johnson kept his championship.

Battling Jim&#x27;s next fight, four months later, also was a title match. On March 27, 1914, in New York City, Sam Langford won a newspaper decision in a ten-rounder with Johnson. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, the coloured champ &quot;won by a wide margin&quot; because Johnson &quot;failed to show anything remotely resembling championship ability.&quot;

Battling Jim fought Langford ten more times (including two more coloured title matches). Two of the fights were draws, including their last fight on September 22, 1918, which was also Battling Jim&#x27;s last pro bout. He faced Joe Jeanette five more times and did not win a single contest. Two of their fights were draws and their last fight on August 20, 1918, Battling Jim&#x27;s penultimate pro fight, was a no-decision.
Of the other former and future Colored Heavyweight Champions that Battling Jim battled, he won only one fight, against Harry Wills, because he broke his wrist blocking a punch in a non-title match and Johnson won by a technical knockout. Battling Jim lost his other two fights with Wills and lost all of the five fights he had with ex-champ Sam McVey in the post-Jack Johnson title shot period.

Battling Jim, who died during Spanish influenza epidemic of 1918, ended with a career record of 30 wins against 31 losses and six draws when his newspaper decisions are factored in. Looking at his dismal performance with the top black heavyweights of his era and his inability to best a one-armed Jack Johnson, Battling Jim Johnson cannot be considered a top contender of his era or a worthy opponent when Jack awarded him the sole title shot given to a black heavyweight from 1908 to 1937. Fittingly, he was scheduled to fight Langford before he died.

In 1915, Jack Johnson lost his title to Jess Willard, the last in a long line of Great White Hopes. Because of the animosity he had generated combined with the virulent racism of the period, it would be 22 years before another African American, Joe Louis, was given a shot at the Heavyweight title.

When it was in his power to give an African American a title shot, Jack Johnson refused to grant that privilege to Sam Langford, the fighter who after former champ Jim Jeffries (a man Langford said he would not face when Jeff was in the prime of his career), had to be considered the No. 1 contender in the heavyweight division. Johnson beat Jeffries but ducked Langford, likely as he feared losing his title. Many people consider the failure of Langford to secure a shot at the Heavyweight title one of the greatest injustices of American sports.

== Later career ==
Langford fought heavyweight Fred Fulton twice, losing the first by seventh-round technical knockout and the second by a four-round decision. Langford was 34 and 35 in each respective fight. Langford was much heavier, yet much shorter than Fulton.

On June 5, 1922, Langford knocked out Tiger Flowers in only the second round. Langford was mostly blind and Flowers would soon afterwards win the World Middleweight Championship.

In 1923, Sam Langford fought and won Boxing&#x27;s last &quot;fight to the finish&quot; for the Mexican Heavyweight title.

His last fight was in 1926, when his failing eyesight finally forced him to retire. Langford was 43 years old and completely blind.

Films exist of Langford fighting Fireman Jim Flynn and Bill Lang.

One story characterizing his career involved Langford in a bout where he had been ordered not to throw any knockout punches until after the 7th round. So walking out for the 8th round, after 21 minutes of patting away, Langford touched gloves with his opponent. &quot;What&#x27;s the matter, Sam, it ain&#x27;t the last round!&quot; said his mystified opponent. &quot;Tis for you son,&quot; said Langford, who promptly knocked his opponent out. Another story involves Langford at a fight where just before it began he apologized to the audience and said he would have to make it a quick fight as he had a train to catch very soon. He then knocked out his opponent within the first round, apologized to the audience once again, and left, just in time to catch his train.

== Life after boxing ==
Langford eventually went completely blind and ended up penniless, living in Harlem, New York City. In 1944, a newspaper column was published about his plight, after which close to $10,000 was donated by fans to help Langford. The column was titled &quot;A Dark Man Laughs&quot; and was written by Al Laney of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;. Eventually, funding was obtained to pay for successful eye surgery.

Langford was enshrined in the Ring Boxing Hall of Fame and Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 1955. He died a year later in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he had been living in a private nursing home.

In 1999, Langford was voted Nova Scotia&#x27;s top male athlete of the 20th century.

In 2013, the jazz trio Tarbaby released a CD entitled &quot;Ballad of Sam Langford&quot;.

In 2018 Langford was ranked fifth in a selection of the greatest 15 athletes in Nova Scotia&#x27;s history.

<text>The is a home computer created by Sharp Corporation. It was first released in 1987 and sold only in Japan.

The initial model has a 10 MHz Motorola 68000 CPU, 1 MB of RAM, and lacks a hard drive. The final model was released in 1993 with a 25 MHz Motorola 68030 CPU, 4 MB of RAM, and optional 80 MB SCSI hard drive. RAM in these systems is expandable to 12 MB, though most games and applications do not require more than 2 MB.

The X68000 has graphics hardware similar to arcade video games of the late-1980s, with custom coprocessors supporting scrolling, tiled backgrounds, and large numbers of sprites. Sound is supplied through multiple sound chips supporting 8 channels of FM synthesis and one channel of adaptive differential pulse-code modulation audio, which are mixed down to 2 analog stereo channels via a DAC chip. As such, video gaming was a major use of the X68000.

==Operating system==
The X68k runs an operating system called Human68k which was developed for Sharp by Hudson Soft. An MS-DOS-workalike, Human68k features English-based commands very similar to those in MS-DOS; executable files have the extension codice_1. Versions of the OS prior to 2.0 have command line output only for common utilities like &quot;format&quot; and &quot;switch&quot;, while later versions included forms-based versions of these utilities. At least three major versions of the OS were released, with several updates in between.

Early models have a GUI called &quot;VS&quot; or &quot;Visual Shell&quot;; later ones were originally packaged with SX-WINDOW. A third GUI called Ko-Window exists with an interface similar to Motif. These GUI shells can be booted from floppy disk or the system&#x27;s hard drive. Most games also boot and run from floppy disk; some are hard disk installable and others require hard disk installation.

Since the system&#x27;s release, software such as Human68k itself, console, SX-Window C compiler suites, and BIOS ROMs have been released as public domain software and are freely available for download. Other operating systems available include OS-9 and NetBSD for X68030.

==Case design==
The X68000 has two soft-eject 5.25-inch floppy drives, or in the compact models, two 3.5-inch floppy drives, and a very distinctive case design of two connected towers, divided by a retractable carrying handle. This system was also one of the first with a software-controlled power switch; pressing it signals the system&#x27;s software to save and shut down. The screen fades to black and the sound fades to silence before the system turns off.

The system&#x27;s keyboard has a mouse port built into either side. The front of the computer has a headphone jack, volume control, joystick, keyboard and mouse ports. The top has a retractable carrying handle only on non-Compact models, a reset button, and a non-maskable interrupt (NMI) button. The rear has a variety of ports, including stereoscopic output for 3D goggles, FDD and HDD expansion ports, and I/O board expansion slots.

==Display==
The monitor supports horizontal scanning rates of 15, 24, and 31 kHz and functions as a cable-ready television (NTSC-J standard) with composite video input. It was a high quality monitor for playing JAMMA-compatible arcade boards due to its analog RGB input and support for all three horizontal scanning rates used with arcade games.

==Disk I/O==
Early machines use the rare Shugart Associates System Interface (SASI) for the hard disk interface; later versions adopted the industry-standard Small Computer System Interface (SCSI). Per the hardware&#x27;s capability, formatted SASI drives can be 10, 20 or 40 MB in size and can be logically partitioned as well.

Human68K does not support the VFAT long filenames standard of modern Windows systems, but it supports 18.3 character filenames instead of the 8.3 character filenames allowed in the FAT filesystem. By default, Human68K will not consider any additional characters beyond the first 8 without the use of a special driver, therefore files and folders that are named the same when viewed through a 8.3 filename but different when viewed through a 18.3 filename will be considered the same. Human68K is case sensitive and allows lower case and Shift JIS encoded Kanji characters in filenames, both of which cause serious problems when a DOS system tries to read such a directory. If a X68000 user restricts themselves to use only filenames according to the 8.3 characters scheme of DOS, using only Latin upper case characters, then a disk written on the X68000 is fully compatible with other Japanese standard platforms like e.g. the NEC PC-9800, the Fujitsu FMR and FM Towns computers. The Japanese standard disk format used by the X68000 is: 77 tracks, 2 heads, 8 sectors, 1024 bytes per sector, 360 rpm (1232 KiB).

==Expansion==
Many add-on cards were released for the system, including networking (Neptune-X), SCSI, memory upgrades, CPU enhancements (JUPITER-X 68040/060 accelerator), and MIDI I/O boards. The system has two joystick ports, both 9-pin male and supporting Atari standard joysticks and MSX controllers. Capcom produced a converter that was originally sold packaged with the X68000 version of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; that allowed users to plug in a Super Famicom or Mega Drive controller into the system. The adapter was made specifically so that users could plug in the Capcom Power Stick Fighter controller into the system.

<doc id="680348" wikidata="Q238907" url="?curid=680348" title="Keiko Kitagawa">
<text>is a Japanese actress. She was an exclusive model for the Japanese &quot;Seventeen&quot; magazine from late 2003 to mid-2006, and quit modeling when she left the magazine. Her first acting role was Sailor Mars in the Sailor Moon live action show &quot;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon&quot; (2003–2004), and after her role in the film &quot;Mamiya Kyōdai&quot;, she left modeling to concentrate on acting. She has appeared in several films, including &quot;The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift&quot; (2006) and &quot;Handsome Suit&quot; (2008), and has played leading roles in the TV Dramas &quot;Mop Girl&quot; (2007), &quot;Homeroom on the Beachside&quot; (2008), &quot;Buzzer Beat&quot; (2009), &quot;Lady Saigo no Hanzai Profile&quot; (2011), and &quot;Akumu-chan&quot; (2012).

==Biography==
Kitagawa was born on August 22, 1986, in Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan. She grew up in Kobe, and lost many friends in the Great Hanshin earthquake in 1995. As a child, she wanted to be a doctor, but by the time she reached high school she was uncertain of what to do in the future. Around this time, she was scouted by a talent agency, and decided to try the entertainment world. Her parents were initially opposed, but they gave their permission on two conditions: that she give up if she was making no progress within a year, and that she put her studies first and graduate from university. She graduated from Meiji University in Tokyo in March 2009.

==Career==
Within a week of joining an agency, Kitagawa was selected as a model and an actress. She was chosen as Miss Seventeen in 2003, which led to her working as a model with the Japanese &quot;Seventeen&quot; until she graduated from the magazine in September 2006. In the latter part of the run, she had her regular feature, &quot;Keiko&#x27;s Beauty Honey&quot;.

As an actress, Kitagawa was given the role of Rei Hino in the live action television series of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, which began her acting career. Her first significant film role was in &quot;Mamiya Kyōdai&quot;, and as result of the influence of the director, Yoshimitsu Morita, she decided to concentrate on acting rather than modeling. She initially concentrated on films, including the leading roles in &quot;Cherry Pie&quot; and &quot;Dear Friends&quot;. In late 2007, she had her first leading role in a TV drama, in the late-night drama &quot;Mop Girl&quot;. In 2008, she was given the role of the heroine in &quot;Homeroom on the Beachside&quot;, Fuji Television&#x27;s Monday 9pm drama for the summer season.

Kitagawa moved to Tokyo when she started working as an actress and model, and has lived there since. She traveled to California to film &quot;The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift&quot;, and returned there to study English for a couple of months early in 2006. From May to December 2007, she wrote a column entitled &quot;Keytan Hakusho&quot; for the Japanese weekly television listings magazine &quot;Weekly The Television&quot;.

Kitagawa has described herself as a stay-at-home person who likes watching DVDs, listening to music, and reading books. When asked what she would do if the world were going to end tomorrow, she said &quot;read books&quot;. She is managed by Stardust Promotion.

She has appeared in the films &quot;Mizu ni Sumu Hana&quot; (2006), &quot;Mamiya Kyōdai&quot; (2006), &quot;The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift&quot; (2006), &quot;Cherry Pie&quot; (lead role) (2006), &quot;Dear Friends&quot; (lead role) (2007), &quot;Sono Toki ha Kare ni Yoroshiku&quot; (2007), &quot;Southbound&quot; (2007), &quot;Heat Island&quot; (2007), &quot;Handsome Suit&quot; (2008), &quot;Orion in Midsummer&quot; (2009), &quot;I&#x27;ll Pay&quot; (2009), &quot;After the Flowers&quot; (lead role) (2010), and &quot;Matataki&quot; (lead role) (2010), and &quot;Elevator to the Scaffold&quot; (2010).

She appeared in the TV dramas &quot;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon&quot; (2003–4), &quot;Mop Girl&quot; (lead role) (2007), &quot;Homeroom on the Beachside&quot; (2008), &quot;Buzzer Beat&quot; (2009), and &quot;Moon Lovers&quot; (2010), &quot;The After-Dinner Mysteries&quot; (2011), &quot;Hero&quot; (2014), and &quot;Detective versus Detectives&quot; (2015).

==Personal life==
In 2016, Kitagawa married singer-songwriter Daigo. The same year, Kitagawa won the Japanese Television Academy Award for Best Actress for &quot;Ie Uru Onna.&quot;

On April 22, 2020, she announced her first pregnancy. On September 7, she gave birth to her daughter. On September 25, 2023, Kitagawa and her husband jointly announced through their agency that they are expecting their second child. On January 31, 2024, she gave birth to a son.

<text>Red Clay Creek is a tributary of White Clay Creek, running through southeastern Pennsylvania and northern Delaware in the United States. As of 2000, portions of the creek are under wildlife habitat protection.

==Course==
The East and West branches both rise in West Marlborough Township, Pennsylvania, near the hamlet of Upland, and flow south through Kennett Square before uniting just north of the Delaware border. The stream enters Delaware near the town of Yorklyn and flows southward through New Castle County, passing through Marshallton. Red Clay Creek empties into White Clay Creek near Stanton, approximately southwest of Wilmington. Ultimately, White Clay Creek enters the Christina River, also near Stanton.

==Tributaries==
* Calf Run, located in the southeast of Mill Creek Hundred
* Pyle&#x27;s Run, located in Christiana Hundred

==History==
The creek serves as a boundary between the Hundreds of Mill Creek and Christiana. The Wilmington and Western Railroad follows the creek south from Yorklyn as far as Greenbank.

In the late 19th Century, several factories were located along Red Clay Creek, including those for the manufacture of flour, wool and iron.

The creek suffered from severe flooding in 1999 due to Hurricane Floyd and in 2003 due to Tropical Storm Henri.

Since 2000, portions of the river, along with other tributaries of White Clay Creek, have been protected as part of the White Clay Creek Wild and Scenic River.

<doc id="680355" wikidata="Q6306998" url="?curid=680355" title="Julian Bond">
<text>Horace Julian Bond (January 14, 1940 – August 15, 2015) was an American social activist, leader of the civil rights movement, politician, professor, and writer. While he was a student at Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia, during the early 1960s, he helped establish the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). In 1971, he co-founded the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Alabama, and served as its first president for nearly a decade.

Bond was elected to serve four terms in the Georgia House of Representatives and later he was elected to serve six terms in the Georgia State Senate, serving a total of twenty years in both legislative chambers. Following his career in the legislature, he was a professor of history at the University of Virginia from 1990 to 2012. From 1998 to 2010, he was chairman of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).

== Early life and education ==
Bond was born in 1940 at Hubbard Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee, to parents Julia Agnes (Washington) and Horace Mann Bond. His father was an educator, then president of Fort Valley State College. His mother, Julia, was a former librarian at Clark Atlanta University, also a historically black college.

The family resided on campus at Fort Valley State College. The house of the Bonds was a frequent stop for scholars, activists, and celebrities passing through, such as W. E. B. Du Bois and Paul Robeson.

In 1945, Bond&#x27;s father accepted the position of president of Lincoln University, where he was its first African-American president, and the family moved North.

In 1957, Bond graduated from George School, a private Quaker preparatory boarding school near Newtown in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. He attended Morehouse College, a historically black college in Atlanta, Georgia. He was very involved at Morehouse. He was a swimmer on the varsity squad. He worked as an intern at Time magazine and was one of the founding members of &quot;The Pegasus&quot;, a literary magazine.

== Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee ==
On April 17, 1960, Bond helped co-found the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).

In 1961, Bond left Morehouse to join the staff of the &quot;Atlanta Inquirer&quot;, a new black protest paper he had helped establish in the summer of 1960 with Jesse Hill, Herman J. Russell, and various other students in the Atlanta Student Movement including Charlayne Hunter-Gault, and Lonnie King.

Following the white violence visited in the summer of 1961 on the first voter registration efforts (under the direction of Bob Moses) in McComb, Mississippi, including the murder of activist Herbert Lee, Bond took the new full-time position of communications director for SNCC assisted by Casey Hayden, Mary King and Dottie Miller, until September 1966. During this period, he travelled frequently to Mississippi (active in the Freedom Summer registration drive in 1964) and to Georgia, Alabama, and Arkansas.

By the mid-1960s, and without embracing a black-separatist agenda, Bond was concluding that the continued presence of white organizers in SNCC was undermining black self-confidence. He later reflected:&quot;The successes Freedom Summer achieved resulted from its embrace of a paradox — it tried to fight bigotry by appealing to people more concerned about whites, not blacks. Appealing to the nation&#x27;s racism accepted white supremacy. By acknowledging its dependence on whites to popularize the civil rights struggle in the South, SNCC contradicted its rhetorical belief in the equal worth of all races, and undermined its insistence that indigenous blacks were best prepared to lead the struggle for their deliverance from white dominance.&quot;At age 31, with SNCC shedding staff and volunteers after its abortive merger with Black Panther Party, Bond returned to Morehouse College in 1971, to complete his Bachelor of Arts in English.

== Georgia General Assembly ==
In addition to his organizing with SNCC, Bond ran for political office in Georgia. In 1965, he was one of 11 African Americans elected to the Georgia House of Representatives. They were aided by the expansion of the franchise for blacks in the state, who largely supported Democratic Party candidates, after national passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965. The latter especially had brought federal oversight to enforce the constitutional rights of blacks to vote. As states ended discriminatory practices in voter registration, African Americans regained the ability to vote and entered the political process.

Although initially undecided about his party affiliation, Bond ultimately ran and was elected as a Democrat, the party of President Lyndon B. Johnson, who had supported civil rights, and signed the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act into law. On January 10, 1966, Georgia representatives voted 184–12 not to seat Bond after the election, because he had publicly endorsed SNCC&#x27;s policy of opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War. Five of the representatives who did vote to seat Bond were white, including Republican Rodney Cook. They disliked his stated sympathy for persons who were &quot;unwilling to respond to a military draft&quot;.

Bond took the legislature to court. A three-judge panel of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia ruled in a 2–1 decision that the Georgia House had not violated any of Bond&#x27;s constitutional rights. The case reached the Supreme Court of the United States in 1966, which ruled 9–0 in the case of &quot;Bond v. Floyd&quot; (385 U.S. 116) that the Georgia House of Representatives had denied Bond his freedom of speech and was required to seat him. From 1967 to 1975, Bond was elected to four terms in the Georgia House, where he organized the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus.

In January 1967, Bond was among eleven Georgia House members who refused to vote when the legislature elected segregationist Democrat Lester Maddox of Atlanta as governor of Georgia over the Republican Bo Callaway. Callaway had led in the 1966 general election by some three thousand votes. Under the Georgia Constitution of 1824, the state legislature had to settle the election because neither major party candidate had polled a majority in the general election. Former Governor Ellis Arnall polled more than fifty thousand votes as a write-in candidate, a factor which led to the impasse. Bond would not support either Maddox or Callaway, although he was ordered to vote by lame duck Lieutenant Governor Peter Zack Geer.

Throughout his House career, Bond had to deal with repeated redistricting of his district by the state legislature:

* 1967–1969: 136th
* 1969–1973: 111th
* 1973–1974: 32nd

Bond was elected in 1974 for the first of six terms in the Georgia Senate, where he served from 1975 to 1987.

During the 1968 presidential election, Bond led an alternate delegation from Georgia to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. There he was the first African American to have his name entered into nomination as a major-party candidate for Vice President of the United States. The 28-year-old Bond quickly declined, citing the constitutional requirement that one must be at least 35 years of age to serve in that office.
Bond ran for the United States House of Representatives from Georgia&#x27;s 5th congressional district (encompassing Atlanta) in 1986. He lost the Democratic nomination in a primary runoff to rival civil rights leader John Lewis in a bitter contest. During it Bond was accused of using cocaine and other drugs. During the campaign, Lewis challenged Bond to take a drug test (Lewis had said he took one and passed). Bond refused, saying the drug test was akin to McCarthyism and trivialized the issue of drugs.

While Bond had raised twice as much money as Lewis and had a larger national reputation, Lewis cast himself as the man on the front lines of the Civil Rights Movement and ran up large margins over Bond among white liberals in Atlanta. As the district had a very large Democratic majority, winning the Democratic primary meant that Lewis was almost certain to win the general election. After he did so, he served in Congress for 30 years until his death on July 17, 2020.

Still dogged by allegations of drug use, Bond resigned from the Georgia Senate the following year. Bond&#x27;s estranged wife, Alice, who had publicly accused him of using cocaine, later retracted her statements.

After leaving politics, Bond taught at several universities in major cities in the North and South, including American University, Drexel, and Harvard.

Bond taught the history of the civil rights movement at the University of Virginia from 1990 to 2012. While there he shared his experiences of the movement with thousands of students through stories, newsreels, music, and film. Bond was on the Board of Selectors of Jefferson Awards for Public Service.

== Later civil-rights activism ==
With Morris Dees, in 1971 Bond helped found the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), a public-interest law firm based in Montgomery, Alabama. He served as its president until 1979, and was an emeritus member of its board of directors at the time of his death in 2015. Bond also advocated for Africans in Europe.

In 1998, Bond was selected as chairman of the NAACP. Bond once referred to leading the NAACP as &quot;the most powerful job a Black man can have in America.&quot; In November 2008, he announced that he would not seek another term as chairman. Bond agreed to stay on in the position through 2009, as the organization celebrated its 100th anniversary. Roslyn Brock was chosen as Bond&#x27;s successor on February 20, 2010.

Bond was an outspoken supporter of the rights of gays and lesbians. He publicly stated his support for same-sex marriage. Most notably, he boycotted the funeral services for Coretta Scott King on the grounds that the King children had chosen an anti-gay megachurch as the venue. This was in conflict with their mother&#x27;s longstanding support for the rights of gay and lesbian people.

In a 2005 speech in Richmond, Virginia, Bond said:

African Americans ... were the only Americans who were enslaved for two centuries, but we were far from the only Americans suffering discrimination then and now ... Sexual disposition parallels race. I was born this way. I have no choice. I wouldn&#x27;t change it if I could. Sexuality is unchangeable.

In a 2007 speech on the Martin Luther King Day Celebration at Clayton State University, Bond said, &quot;If you don&#x27;t like gay marriage, don&#x27;t get gay married.&quot; His positions pitted elements of the NAACP against religious groups in the Civil Rights Movement who oppose gay marriage. Most resistance came from within the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), which was partially blamed for the success of the gay marriage ban amendment in California. On October 11, 2009, Bond appeared at the National Equality March in Washington, D.C., and spoke about the rights of the LGBT community, a speech that was aired live on C-SPAN.

Bond was a strong critic of policies that contribute to anthropogenic climate change. He was among a group of protesters arrested at the White House for civil disobedience in opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline in February 2013.

== Criticism of Republican administration and Tea Party ==

Bond was a strong critic of the George W. Bush administration, in large part because he believed it was illegitimate. Twice in 2001, first in February when he spoke to the NAACP board and then in July when he spoke at that organization&#x27;s national convention, he attacked the administration for selecting Cabinet secretaries &quot;from the Taliban wing of American politics&quot;. Bond specifically criticized Attorney General John Ashcroft, who had opposed affirmative action, and Interior Secretary Gale Norton, who defended the Confederacy in a 1996 speech on states&#x27; rights. In the selection of these individuals, Bond said, Bush had appeased &quot;the wretched appetites of the extreme right wing and chosen Cabinet officials whose devotion to the Confederacy is nearly canine in its uncritical affection&quot;. House Majority Leader Dick Armey responded to Bond&#x27;s statement with a letter in which he accused NAACP leaders of &quot;racial McCarthyism&quot;. Bond later said at the annual NAACP convention that year, that since Bush&#x27;s election, he had &quot;had his picture taken with more black people than voted for him.&quot;

== Work and appearances in media ==
In 2012, Bond was featured in &quot;Julian Bond: Reflections from the Frontlines of the Civil Rights Movement&quot;, a documentary film by Eduardo Montes-Bradley.

From 1980 to 1997, Bond hosted &quot;America&#x27;s Black Forum&quot;. He was also a commentator for radio&#x27;s &quot;Byline&quot; and NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Today Show&quot;. He authored the nationally syndicated newspaper column &quot;Viewpoint&quot;, and narrated the critically acclaimed PBS series &quot;Eyes on the Prize&quot; in 1987 and 1990.

Bond hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on April 9, 1977, becoming the first black political figure to do so. In the same year, he also appeared in the Richard Pryor vehicle &quot;Greased Lightning&quot;. In 1978, Bond played himself in the miniseries &quot;King&quot;. He also had a small appearance playing State Representative John E. White in the movie &quot;Ray&quot; (2004), and played himself in the movie &quot;5 to 7&quot; (2014).

== Personal life and death ==
On July 28, 1961, Bond married Alice Clopton, a student at Spelman College. They had five children: Phyllis Jane Bond-McMillan, Horace Mann Bond II, Michael Julian Bond (an Atlanta City councilman), Jeffrey Alvin Bond, and Julia Louise Bond. They divorced on November 10, 1989.

In 1990 Bond married Pamela Sue Horowitz, a former SPLC staff attorney. Bond died from complications of vascular disease on August 15, 2015, in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, at the age of 75.

== Awards and honors ==

<text>Yan, known in historiography as the Western Yan (; 384–394) was a dynastic state of China ruled by the Xianbei ethnicity. The dynasty existed during the era of Sixteen Kingdoms, but it is not counted among the 16. It was founded by Murong Hong in 384 in the aftermath of the Former Qin&#x27;s defeat by the Eastern Jin in the Battle of Fei River, with the stated intent of permitting the Xianbei, whom the Former Qin&#x27;s emperor Fu Jiān had relocated to Former Qin&#x27;s capital region after destroying the Former Yan in 370. It initially also was intended to rescue the last Former Yan emperor Murong Wei, until he was executed by Fu Jiān in 385. It was a state that was characterized by extreme political instability and internal fighting, as all seven of its rulers (during a short span of 10 years) died of unnatural causes. After eviscerating the Former Qin, the people of the state abandoned the Guanzhong region and headed east back toward their homeland, but eventually settled down in modern Shanxi. It was destroyed in 394 as Later Yan&#x27;s emperor Murong Chui wanted to reunite the people formerly of Yan and conquered it.

Some rulers of the Western Yan declared themselves emperors while some declared themselves &quot;wang&quot; (translatable as either &quot;king&quot; or &quot;prince&quot;).

== History ==

=== Background ===
After the fall of Former Yan, the last emperor Murong Wei and his brothers were relocated near the Former Qin capital, Chang&#x27;an, where they were allowed to serve as military generals and officials. Murong Hong was made Admistrator of Beidi while Murong Chong was appointed Administrator of Pingyang. As part of Qin&#x27;s plan to integrate the various tribes with each other, many Xianbei from the east were resettled in the Guanzhong region, with around 40,000 of them at the time of Former Yan&#x27;s demise.

In 383, Former Qin suffered a devastating defeat to the Eastern Jin dynasty at the Battle of Fei River. With the Qin exposed, Murong Wei&#x27;s uncle, Murong Chui restored the state as the Later Yan in Hebei in 384. When news of the restoration reached Beidi, Murong Hong fled east of Tong Pass and gathered the Xianbei. After defeating a Qin force at Huayin, he claimed several offices for himself including the Grand General while declaring Murong Chui as the new prime minister. Murong Chong also rebelled in Pingyang with 20,000 people, but was soon defeated and joined Hong.

Murong Wei was still alive in Chang&#x27;an as the rebellions began. The ruler of Former Qin, Fu Jian, ordered him to tell his family members to stand down, but Wei instead secretly deferred his authority over to Hong in a letter, allowing him to take the throne once he hear of his death. Hong changed the reign era, which is often seen as the start of the Western Yan, before leading his soldiers towards Chang&#x27;an.

=== Siege of Chang&#x27;an ===
Not long after, Murong Hong was assassinated by his official, Gao Gai, who installed Murong Chong as the new leader. After setting camp at Epang Palace, Chong laid siege on Chang&#x27;an and fought several battles against Fu Jian for months. During the siege, Murong Wei plotted a rebellion but was discovered and executed by Fu Jian in 385, prompting Chong to claim the title of Emperor of Yan. Eventually, a severe famine broke out in Chang&#x27;an, forcing Fu Jian to flee and leave his son, Fu Hong to hold the city. However, Fu Hong soon followed suit, allowing Murong Chong&#x27;s forces to enter and sack Chang&#x27;an.

Fu Jian never returned to Chang&#x27;an, as he was captured and killed by the Later Qin. With the ancient capital in hand, Murong Chong was content with settling in, leaving many of his Xianbei followers unsatisfied as they wanted to return to their homeland in the east. Chong was fearful of dealing with his uncle, Murong Chui, so he enacted several policies to help the Xianbei settle. However, in 386, he was assassinated by one of his generals and replaced with Duan Sui.

=== Exodus to the east ===
Duan Sui claimed the title of King of Yan, but he was suddenly killed by Murong Yong and Murong Heng (慕容恆), who acclaimed Murong Yi as the new king. Under Yi, the Xianbei began their exodus to the east from Chang&#x27;an, during which the throne was passed from him to Murong Yao and to Murong Zhong in a span of a few months, as they were all assassinated in succession. After Zhong&#x27;s death, Murong Yong was installed to the throne.

At the time, Shanxi was controlled by Fu Jian&#x27;s son, Fu Pi, who had declared himself emperor after his father&#x27;s death. Yong sent envoys to him asking for permission to pass through his territory so that he could join Murong Chui, but was denied. Yong defeated Fu Pi in a decisive battle, and Fu Pi was soon intercepted and killed by Eastern Jin forces. Yong then occupied Fu Pi&#x27;s capital at Zhangzi (長子, in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), where contrary to his previous intentions, he declared himself the new Emperor of Yan.

=== Rule in Shanxi and fall ===
Though Murong Yong was a distant relative of Murong Wei, being the grandson of Murong Yun (慕容運), the uncle of Former Yan&#x27;s founder Murong Huang, his proclamation threatened the legitimacy of Later Yan, as there were now two states claiming to be the successor of Former Yan. After several princes defected to Later Yan, Murong Yong had the descendants of Murong Chui and Murong Jun, Former Yan&#x27;s second ruler and Murong Wei&#x27;s father, all killed.

Murong Yong ruled Shanxi for roughly nine years, during which he made little effort to expand. He briefly fought with Later Qin and tried to capture Luoyang from Eastern Jin, but was ultimately unsuccessful. In 392, the Dingling-led Zhai Wei state requested reinforcements from Western Yan as they were under attack by Later Yan, but Yong failed to respond and allowed them to fall. With Hebei pacified, Murong Chui set sight on conquering Western Yan and ending the legitimacy question. In 394, Chui personally led his forces to attack Western Yan and laid siege on Zhangzi. Yong was eventually captured and killed, thus ending the Western Yan.
