<text>The Las Vegas Valley is a major metropolitan area in the southern part of the U.S. state of Nevada, and the second largest in the Southwestern United States. The state&#x27;s largest urban agglomeration, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Statistical Area is coextensive since 2003 with Clark County, Nevada. The Valley is largely defined by the Las Vegas Valley land formation, a basin area surrounded by mountains to the north, south, east and west of the metropolitan area. The Valley is home to the three largest incorporated cities in Nevada: Las Vegas, Henderson and North Las Vegas. Eleven unincorporated towns governed by the Clark County government are part of the Las Vegas Township and constitute the largest community in the state of Nevada.

The names Las Vegas and Vegas are interchangeably used to indicate the Valley, the Strip, and the city, and as a brand by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority to denominate the region. The Valley is affectionately known as the Ninth Islandby Hawaii natives and Las Vegans alike, in part due to the large number of people originally from Hawaii who live in and regularly travel to Las Vegas.

Since the 1990s, the Las Vegas Valley has seen rapid growth, tripling its population from 741,459 in 1990 to 2,227,053 estimated in 2018, increasing to 2,953,000 in 2024. The Las Vegas Valley remains one of the fastest growing metropolitan areas in the United States. In its relatively short history, it has established a diverse presence in international business, commerce, urban development, and entertainment, as well as one of the most visited tourist attractions destinations in the world. In 2014, a record-breaking 41 million people visited the Las Vegas area, producing a gross metropolitan product of more than $100 billion.

==History==

The first reported non-Native American visitor to the Las Vegas Valley was the Mexican scout Rafael Rivera in 1829. Las Vegas was named by Mexicans in the Antonio Armijo party, including Rivera, who used the water in the area while heading north and west along the Old Spanish Trail from Texas. In the 19th century, areas of the valley contained artesian wells that supported extensive green areas, or meadows, hence the name &quot;Las Vegas&quot; (&quot;vegas&quot; being Spanish for &quot;meadows&quot;).

The area was previously settled by Mormon farmers in 1854 and later became the site of a United States Army fort in 1864, beginning a long relationship between southern Nevada and the U.S. military. Since the 1930s, Las Vegas has generally been identified as a gambling center as well as a resort destination, primarily targeting adults.

Nellis Air Force Base is located in the northeast corner of the valley. The ranges that the Nellis pilots use and various other land areas used by various federal agencies, limit growth of the valley in terms of geographic area.

Businessman Howard Hughes arrived in the late 1960s and purchased many casino hotels, as well as television and radio stations in the area. Legitimate corporations began to purchase casino hotels as well, and the mob was run out by the federal government over the next several years. The constant stream of tourist dollars from the hotels and casinos was augmented by a new source of federal money from the establishment of what is now Nellis Air Force Base. The influx of military personnel and casino job-hunters helped start a land building boom which is now leveling off.

The Las Vegas area remains one of the world&#x27;s top entertainment destinations.

==Boundaries==
The valley is contained in the Las Vegas Valley landform. This includes the cities of Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, and Henderson, and the unincorporated towns of Summerlin South, Paradise, Spring Valley, Sunrise Manor, Enterprise, Winchester, and Whitney. The valley is located within the larger metropolitan area, as the metropolitan area covers all of Clark County including parts that do not fall within the valley.

The government of Clark County has an &quot;Urban Planning Area&quot; of Las Vegas. This definition is a roughly rectangular area, about from east to west and from north to south. Notable exclusions from the &quot;Urban Planning Area&quot; include Red Rock, Blue Diamond, and Mount Charleston.

The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department is the largest police department in the valley and the state and exercises jurisdiction in the entire county. There are approximately 3,000 police officers who cover the city of Las Vegas; unincorporated areas; the town of Laughlin, about from Downtown Las Vegas; and desert, park, and mountain areas within Clark County. The department does not exercise primary jurisdiction in areas with separate police forces such as North Las Vegas, Henderson, Boulder City, Nellis Air Force Base and the Paiute reservation.

The metropolitan area was created for the 1970 census when it only included Clark County. In 2000, the metropolitan area was changed to include Nye County, Nevada, and Mohave County, Arizona, but it later returned to only being Clark County.

The Office of Management and Budget has designated Clark County as the Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise, NV Metropolitan Statistical Area. The United States Census Bureau ranked the Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise, NV Metropolitan Statistical Area as the 31st most populous metropolitan statistical area of the United States as of July 1, 2012.

The Office of Management and Budget has further designated the Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise, NV Metropolitan Statistical Area as a component of the more extensive Las Vegas–Henderson, NV–AZ CSA, the 27th most populous combined statistical area and the 30th most populous primary statistical area of the United States as of July 1, 2012.

==Geography and environment==


The Las Vegas Valley lies in the Mojave Desert. The valley in the northwest section is a northwest-by-southeast trending area, and trending parallel to Las Vegas Wash, lies at the northeast of the Spring Mountains massif.

U.S. Route 95 leaves Las Vegas&#x27;s northwest and goes northwesterly through the northwest valley section, with Las Vegas Wash about northeast. U.S. 95 lies on the southwest perimeter of the valley bottomlands, and small alluvial fan areas from the northeast Spring Mountains border southwest.

A &quot;distorted surface&quot;, a playa-like region, occurs at the farthest northwest area, for about , starting from Nevada Route 157. At Nevada Route 156, northwest, the distorted surface, bottom land turns north, a area in length and about wide. It lies at the south drainage section of the Three Lakes Valley, where a water divide separates Dog Bone Lake in the valley&#x27;s center from the southwest washes that drain into the Las Vegas Valley (upland Las Vegas Wash).

The Corn Creek Dunes lie about southwest of Route 156&#x27;s intersection with U.S. 95, and they are slightly northeast of Las Vegas Wash.

The Las Vegas Valley is around . All perimeters, except the northwest, are foothills or mountain ranges, with all highway routes entering the foothills; this includes the Interstate 15 to the southwest, as it climbs to Jean Pass (north), before traversing Ivanpah Valley. Only the U.S. Route 95 northwest follows an actual valley. The northwest section, thus describes the entire landform as a central, and large valley with an attached feeder valley northwest, and in this case the northwest source, and actual course of the Las Vegas Wash.

The valley is a fault-bounded structural and hydrologic basin made of alluvial-fan deposits. There are several aquifers contained within the valley including the Las Vegas Aquifer. These heavily depleted water sources exist at about in depth. As of 1986, estimate show that the valley floor in Downtown Las Vegas has subsided by about and about along The Strip as a result of pumping from these aquifers.

===Climate===
The Las Vegas Valley lies in a relatively high-altitude portion of the Mojave Desert, with a subtropical hot-desert climate. The Valley generally averages less than of rain annually. Daily daytime summer temperatures in July and August typically range from to , while nights generally range from to . Very low humidity, however, tempers the effect of these temperatures, though dehydration, heat exhaustion, and sun stroke can occur after even a limited time outdoors in the summer. The interiors of automobiles often prove deadly to small children and pets during the summer and surfaces exposed to the sun can cause first- and second-degree burns to unprotected skin. July and August can also be marked by monsoon season, when moist winds from the Gulf of California soak much of the Southwestern United States. While not only raising humidity levels, these winds develop into dramatic desert thunderstorms that can sometimes cause flash flooding.

Winter days in metropolitan Las Vegas range from mild to quite chilly, and sunny most days; while winter itself is of short duration. Winter highs in December and January usually range from to , while nighttime lows range from to . The mountains surrounding the valley are snow-covered during the winter season, but snow accumulation in the metropolitan area itself is uncommon. Every few years apart, however, Las Vegas does get a small measurable snowfall.

Spring and fall are generally dry and with hot, sunny days and cool nights.

===Fault zones===
The valley is an active earthquake zone crossed by multiple fault and thrust lines. These include the long Frenchman Mountain Fault capable of a magnitude 7 event, Whitney Mesa Fault, Cashman Fault, Valley View Fault, Decatur Fault, Eglington Fault and the West Charleston Fault.

===Air quality===
Having part of the region in a desert basin creates problems with air quality. From the dust the wind picks up, to the smog produced by vehicles, to the pollen in the air, the valley has several bad air days.

Pollen can be a major problem several weeks a year, with counts occasionally in the 70,000-plus range. Local governments are trying to control this by banning plants that produce the most pollen.

The dust problems usually happen on very windy days, so they tend to be short and seasonal. Full-fledged dust storms are rare.

Smog, on the other hand, gets worse when there is no wind to move the air out of the valley. Also, in winter it is possible for an inversion to form in the valley.

Since manufacturing is not a dominant industry of Las Vegas, and with Clark County working to control air quality problems, success has been shown over the years.

===Water===

The native flora does little to help the soil retain water. During the intense rains of monsoon season or (relatively) wet months of January and February, a network of dry natural channels, called washes or arroyos, carved into the valley floor allows water to flow down from the mountains and converge in the Las Vegas Wash which runs through the Clark County Wetlands Park. The wash system used to form a large natural wetlands which then flowed into the Colorado River, until the construction of Hoover Dam on the Colorado River led to the creation of Lake Mead. Further development in the 1980s and 1990s made Lake Las Vegas, which required directing the Las Vegas Wash into tunnels which run under Lake Las Vegas and into Lake Mead.

Nevada receives an allocation of water each year from Lake Mead, with credits for water it returns to the lake. The allocations were made with the Colorado River Compact when Nevada had a much smaller population and very little agriculture. The allocations were also made during a wet string of years, which overstated the available water in the entire watershed. As a result, precipitation that is below normal for a few years can significantly affect the Colorado River reservoirs. The Las Vegas area uses most of this allocation with Laughlin, Nevada using most of the remaining allocation. In June 2007, the price of a cubic meter was 57 cents in Las Vegas. Las Vegas gets around 90 percent of its water from Lake Mead.

Early Vegas depended on the aquifer which fed the flowing springs supporting the meadows that gave the area its name, but the pumping of water from these caused a large drop in the water levels and ground subsidence over wide areas of the valley. Today, the aquifers are basically used to store water that is pumped from the lake during periods of low demand and pumped out during periods of high demand.

===Urbanization===
The population doubling time in the greater metropolitan area was under ten years, since the early 1970s and the Las Vegas metropolitan area now has a population approaching three million people. This rapid population growth led to a significant urbanization of desert lands into industrial and commercial areas (see suburbia).

==Economy==

The driving force in Las Vegas is the tourism industry and the area has about 150,000 hotel rooms, more than any other city in the world. In the past, casinos and celebrity shows were the two major attractions for the area. Now shopping, conventions, fine dining, and outdoor beauty are also major forces in attracting tourist dollars.

Las Vegas serves as world headquarters for the world&#x27;s largest Fortune 500 gaming company, MGM Resorts International. Several companies involved in the manufacture of electronic gaming machines, such as slot machines, are located in the Las Vegas area. In the first decade of the 21st century, shopping and dining have become attractions of their own. Tourism marketing and promotion are handled by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, a county-wide agency. Its annual Visitors Survey provides detailed information on visitor numbers, spending patterns, and resulting revenues.

While Las Vegas has historically attracted high-stake gamblers from around the world, it is now facing tougher competition from the UK, Hong Kong and Macau (China), Eastern Europe and developing areas in the Middle East.

Las Vegas has recently enjoyed a boom in population and tourism. The urban area has grown outward so quickly that it borders Bureau of Land Management holdings along its edges. This has led to an increase in land values such that medium- and high-density development is occurring closer to the core. The Chinatown of Las Vegas was constructed in the early 1990s on Spring Mountain Road. Chinatown initially consisted of only one large shopping center complex, but the area was expanded with shopping centers that contain various Asian businesses. Over the past few years, retirees have been moving to the metro area, driving businesses that support them from housing to health care.

While the cost of housing spiked up over 40% in 2004, the lack of business and income taxes still makes Nevada an attractive place for many companies to relocate to or expand existing operations. Being a true twenty-four-hour city, call centers have always seemed to find Las Vegas a good place to hire workers who are accustomed to working at all hours.

The construction industry accounts for a share of the economy in Las Vegas. Hotel casinos planned for the Strip can take years to build and employ thousands of workers. Developers discovered that there was demand for high-end condominiums. By 2005, more than 100 condominium buildings were in various stages of development, however, in 2008, the construction industry went into a downturn due to the Great Recession, though the industry has since seen a rebound.

In 2000, more than 21,000 new homes and 26,000 resale homes were purchased. In early 2005, there were 20 residential development projects of more than each underway. During that same period, Las Vegas was regarded as the fastest-growing community in the United States.

Other promising residential and office developments have begun construction around Downtown Las Vegas. New condominium and high-rise hotel projects have changed the Las Vegas skyline dramatically in recent years. Many large high-rise projects are planned for Downtown Las Vegas, as well as the Las Vegas Strip.

===Construction===

Construction in Las Vegas is a major industry and quickly growing with the population. In March 2011, construction employed 40,700 people and is expected to grow with the recovering economy. Since the mega resorts that define Las Vegas today began going up in the early 1970s, construction has played a vital role in both commercial and non commercial developments. Cranes are a constant part of the Las Vegas Skyline. At any given time there are 300 new homes being constructed in Las Vegas. In addition, in recent years Las Vegas has seen a spike in high-rise housing units. New suburban master planned communities are also becoming common in Las Vegas ever since The Howard Hughes Corporation began work on Summerlin, an upper-class community on the west side of the valley.

The massive CityCenter project, by MGM Mirage, broke ground on the Strip in 2006. It put a massive strain on the construction ability and workforce of the area due to number of laborers and amount of materials required. Because of this, prices of almost any construction project in Las Vegas doubled. The project was completed in 2009 and includes multiple hotels and condominiums, as well as shopping and a casino. At a cost of $8.5 billion, it is the most expensive privately funded construction project in U.S. history.

The Tropicana Hotel, opened in 1957, will be demolished in April 2025 in order to create a new baseball stadium. Bally&#x27;s Corporation, the owner of the hotel, indicated that upon completion of the stadium it would further develop the site.

===Housing===
Traditionally, housing consisted primarily of single-family detached homes. Slab-on-grade foundations are the common base for residential buildings in the valley. Apartments generally were two-story buildings. Until the 1990s, there were exceptions, but they were few and far between. In the 1990s, Turnberry Associates constructed the first high rise condominium towers. Prior to this, there were only a handful of mid-rise multi-family buildings. By the mid-2000s, there was a major move into high rise condominiums towers, which affected the region&#x27;s skyline around the Strip.

The Las Vegas Valley is home to various suburban master planned communities that include extensive recreational amenities such as lakes, golf courses, parks, bike paths and jogging trails. Planned communities in the valley include Aliante, Anthem, Cadence, Centennial Hills, Green Valley, Inspirada, Lake Las Vegas, The Lakes, Mountain&#x27;s Edge, Peccole Ranch, Providence, Rhodes Ranch, Seven Hills, Skye Canyon, Southern Highlands, and Summerlin.

===Technology companies===
Some technology companies have either relocated to Las Vegas or were created there. For various reasons, Las Vegas has had a high concentration of technology companies in electronic gaming and telecommunications industries. 

Some current technology companies in southern Nevada include: Bigelow Aerospace, Petroglyph, Switch Communications, US Support LLC, Fanatics, and Zappos.

In 2015, Electric vehicle startup Faraday Future has chosen North Las Vegas&#x27;s Apex Industrial Park for its $1 billion car factory.

Companies that originally were formed in the Las Vegas region, but have since sold or relocated include Westwood Studios (sold to Electronic Arts), Systems Research &amp; Development (Sold to IBM), Yellowpages.com (Sold to BellSouth and SBC), and MPower Communications.

===Tourism===

The major attractions in the Las Vegas Valley are the hotel/casinos. These hotels generally consist of large gambling areas, theaters for live performances, shopping, bars/clubs, and several restaurants and cafes. There are clusters of large hotel/casinos located in both downtown Las Vegas and on the Las Vegas Strip. The largest hotels are mainly located on the Strip, which is a four-mile section of Las Vegas Boulevard. These hotels provide thousands of rooms of various sizes. Fifteen of the world&#x27;s 30 largest hotels by room count are on the Strip, with a total of over 62,000 rooms. There are many hotel/casinos in the city&#x27;s downtown area as well, which was the original focal point of the Valley&#x27;s gaming industry. Several hotel/casinos ranging from large to small are also located around the city and metro area. Many of the largest hotel, casino, and resort properties in the world are located on the Las Vegas Strip.

The valley&#x27;s casinos can be grouped into several locations. The largest is the Las Vegas Strip, followed by Downtown Las Vegas, and then the smaller Boulder Strip. There are also several one-off single standing hotel/casinos dotted around the valley and the metro area.

In 2011, the majority of tourists arrived from the western states (55%) with 31% from California alone. Approximately 16% of tourists arrived from outside North America.

===Shopping===
Las Vegas has expanded its attractiveness to visitors by offering both affordable and high-end merchandise in many shops and shopping malls. Many hotels on the Las Vegas Strip also have adjacent shopping malls, giving the Las Vegas area the highest concentration of shopping malls in any four mile stretch of road. In addition to the malls on the Strip, there are several outlying malls in the City of Las Vegas, Henderson, and the surrounding area. The monorail, lying somewhat east of the Strip, facilitates north–south travel, including stations at several casinos and the Las Vegas Convention Center.

The Las Vegas Convention Center is one of the largest in the world with 1,940,631 sq ft (180,290.5 m2) of exhibit space. These events bring in an estimated $7.4 billion of revenue to the city each year, and host over 5 million attendees.
==Culture and the arts==

The &quot;First Friday&quot; celebration, held on the first Friday of each month, exhibits the works of local artists and musicians in an area just south of downtown. The city is home to an extensive Downtown Arts District which hosts numerous galleries, film festivals, and events.

The Southern Nevada Zoological-Botanical Park, also known as the Las Vegas Zoo, used to exhibit over 150 species of animals and plants. The Zoo closed its doors in September 2013.

The Shark Reef Aquarium at Mandalay Bay is the only aquarium that is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums in the state of Nevada. It features over 2,000 animals and 1,200 species in 1.6 million gallons of seawater.

The $485 million Smith Center for the Performing Arts is located downtown in Symphony Park. The center is appropriate for Broadway shows and other major touring attractions as well as orchestral, opera, choir, jazz, and dance performances.

Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art is a facility presenting high-quality art exhibitions from major national and international museums. Past exhibits have included the works of Andy Warhol, Alexander Calder, and Peter Carl Fabergé. A self-guided audio tour is also offered.

The Las Vegas Natural History Museum features robot dinosaurs, live fish, and more than 26 species of preserved animals. There are several &quot;hands-on&quot; areas where animals can be petted.

The Atomic Testing Museum, affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution, houses artifacts from the Nevada Test Site and records the dramatic history of the atomic age through a series of interactive modules, timelines, films, and actual equipment and gadgets from the site.

In 2019, &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that there was a &quot;burgeoning literary scene&quot; at Las Vegas centered around the Black Mountain Institute, a literature organization at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and its literary magazine, &quot;The Believer&quot;.

The valley is home to numerous other art galleries, orchestras, ballets, theaters, sculptures, and museums as well.

==Transportation==


Harry Reid International Airport (LAS) provides commercial flights into the Las Vegas Valley. The airport serves domestic, international and cargo flights, as well as some private aircraft. General aviation traffic, however, will typically use the much smaller North Las Vegas Airport or other airfields in the county.
Public transportation is provided by RTC Transit. Numerous bus routes cover Las Vegas, Henderson, North Las Vegas and other suburban areas.

The Las Vegas Monorail runs from MGM Grand Las Vegas at the south end of the Strip to the Sahara Las Vegas at the north end of the Strip.
The street numbering system is divided by the following streets:
* Westcliff Drive, US 95, Fremont Street and Charleston Boulevard divide the north–south block numbers from west to east.
* Las Vegas Boulevard divides the east–west streets from the Las Vegas Strip to near the Stratosphere, then Main Street becomes the dividing line from the Stratosphere to the North Las Vegas border, after which the Goldfield Street alignment officially divides east and west.
* On the east side of Las Vegas, block numbers between Charleston Boulevard and Washington Avenue are different along Nellis Boulevard, which is the eastern border of the city limits.
* All city street signs begin with a &quot;N&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;W&quot; or &quot;E&quot; designation.

Until 1997, the Amtrak &quot;Desert Wind&quot; train service ran through Las Vegas using the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) rails that run through the city; Amtrak service to Las Vegas has since been replaced by Amtrak&#x27;s Thruway Motorcoach bus service. Plans to restore Los Angeles to Las Vegas Amtrak service using a Talgo train have been discussed but no plan for a replacement has been implemented. The Las Vegas Amtrak station was located in the Plaza Hotel. It had the distinction of being the only train station located in a casino.

===Airports===
* Henderson Executive Airport
* Ivanpah Valley Airport (planned)
* Harry Reid International Airport
* North Las Vegas Airport

===Rail and bus===
While the Las Vegas area does not have any passenger rail service, Brightline West intends to revive passenger trains with a high-speed train between the Las Vegas station and the Rancho Cucamonga station in Greater Los Angeles.

Las Vegas receives about 30 freight trains per day , and serves as a district crew change point, requiring all trains to stop in downtown. Freight traffic was 179,284 cars in 2004.

===Roads===
Two major freeways—Interstate 15 and Interstate 11 (including US 93 and US 95)—cross in downtown Las Vegas. I-15 connects Las Vegas to Los Angeles and San Diego, and heads northeast to Salt Lake City and beyond. I-11 goes northwest to the Las Vegas Paiute Indian Reservation and southeast to Henderson, bypassing downtown Boulder City just to the south, and then to the Mike O&#x27;Callaghan–Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge over the Colorado River, from there U.S. Route 93 continues towards Phoenix, Arizona. I-11 will eventually be the connection from Nogales, Arizona to the Reno and Sparks vicinity of either Fernley or at the Reno Spaghetti Bowl in Reno when completed. US 95 connects the city to northwestern Nevada, including Carson City (the state capitol) and Reno. US 93 splits from I-15 northeast of Las Vegas and goes north through the northeastern part of the state, serving Ely and Wells and US 95 heads south from I-11 and US 93 in Boulder City through far southeastern California. A three-quarters of the Las Vegas Beltway has been built, consisting of Interstate 215 on the south and Clark County 215 on the west and north. Other radial routes include SR 160 to Pahrump and SR 147 and SR 564 (former SR 146) to Lake Mead.

With the notable exceptions of Las Vegas Boulevard, Boulder Highway and Tonopah Highway (better known as the northern part of Rancho Drive), the majority of surface streets outside downtown Las Vegas are laid out along Public Land Survey System section lines. Many are maintained, in part, by the Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT) as state highways.

===Fuel===
The Las Vegas area is dependent on imported gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel as is most of Nevada, which has only one refinery. The region is dependent on the Calnev Pipeline and Unev pipeline as its two main sources of supply. Limited diesel is delivered to a dedicated terminal in North Las Vegas by rail. Diversified supply was provided by the completion of construction on the Unev pipeline in 2011 and its full operational status in 2012.

===Electricity===
About 25% of the electric power from Hoover Dam goes to Nevada, and about 70% of power to Southern Nevada comes from natural gas fired power stations.

==Sports==

Las Vegas is home to several notable minor league teams, as well as the UNLV Rebels, and three major professional teams, the Las Vegas Raiders of the National Football League, the Vegas Golden Knights of the National Hockey League, and the Las Vegas Aces of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association. The Oakland Athletics of Major League Baseball plan to move to Las Vegas in 2028.

==Recreation==
Las Vegas has many natural outdoor recreational options.

There are several multi-use trail systems within the valley operated by multiple organizations. The River Mountains Loop Trail is a trail that connects the west side of the valley with Hoover Dam and Lake Mead. Summerlin offers more than 150 miles of award-winning trails within the community. There are also the Angel Park Trail, Bonanza Trail, and the county&#x27;s Flamingo Arroyo Trail, I-215 West Beltway Trail (), I-215 East Beltway Trail (), Tropicana/Flamingo Washes Trail and the Western Trails Park Area Equestrian Trails (4 miles).

The Las Vegas Valley also hosts world class mountain biking including Bootleg Canyon Mountain Bike Park located in Boulder City which boasts itself as one of the International Mountain Biking Association&#x27;s &quot;epic rides&quot;.

<text>Paul Delvaux (; 23 September 1897 – 20 July 1994) was a Belgian painter noted for his dream-like scenes of women, classical architecture, trains and train stations, and skeletons, often in combination. He is often considered a surrealist, although he only briefly identified with the Surrealist movement. He was influenced by the works of Giorgio de Chirico and René Magritte, but developed his own fantastical subjects and hyper-realistic styling, combining the detailed classical beauty of academic painting with the bizarre juxtapositions of surrealism.

Throughout his long career, Delvaux explored &quot;Nude and skeleton, the clothed and the unclothed, male and female, desire and horror, eroticism and death – Delvaux&#x27;s major anxieties in fact, and the greater themes of his later work [...]&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Delvaux was born on 23 September 1897 in Antheit (now part of Wanze) in the Belgian province of Liège. His parents lived in Brussels, but his mother went to her own mother&#x27;s home to have her first child. His birthplace house would later be destroyed by fire, in 1940.

His father was Jean Delvaux, a prosperous barrister at the Court of Appeal in Brussels. His mother was the musician Laure Jamotte, who became a strong, dominant presence in his life, directing, controlling, and repressing his childhood and adolescent desires.

The young Delvaux studied Greek and Latin, and absorbed the fiction of Jules Verne and the poetry of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;. His artwork was to be greatly influenced by these works, starting with his earliest drawings showing mythological scenes. His music lessons were conducted in the school&#x27;s museum room, where a human skeleton in a glass cabinet was always present.

From 1910 to 1916, he studied Classics at the Atheneum of Saint-Gilles, where he was a middling or average student. Upon his graduation, his parents got him an office job with a shipping company in Brussels. It was soon evident that he had no skills or interests in business or law, and he was grudgingly allowed to study architecture at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts despite his ambition to become a painter.

In 1916, he started at the Académie, initially learning the basics of architecture and perspective drawing. He was then disqualified due to his weakness in mathematics, and dropped out after his first year. Delvaux was worried about his future career, and passed the time by copying postcards. His mother advised him to paint from nature, and in 1919 he produced his first watercolors of some scenic vistas.

On a family vacation in Zeebrugge in 1919, he met by chance the painter Franz Courtens. Upon seeing some of the watercolor landscapes Delvaux had painted, Courtens told the parents, &quot;Your son has talent and has a great future in front of him&quot;. Courtens encouraged the failed student to return to the Académie to study painting, and the parents finally acquiesced to this plan.

In 1919, Delvaux returned and studied with decorative painter Constant Montald (a former student of Puvis de Chavannes), and other teachers. The painter Alfred Bastien and symbolist painter Jean Delville also encouraged Delvaux, whose works from this period were primarily naturalistic landscapes. During 1920–1921, he also performed his mandatory military service as a minor logistics clerk, while studying with Delville at the Académie.

==Artistic career==
Initially, Delvaux was influenced by the style of 19th-century French and Belgian academic painting as represented by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres or Puvis de Chavannes. Delvaux completed some 80 paintings between 1920 and 1925. His early paintings were mostly post-impressionist, somber landscapes, but also included dark, gritty urban scenes, such as &quot;Les cheminots de la gare du Luxembourg&quot; (&quot;Railroad Workers of Luxembourg Station&quot;, 1922).

In 1924, he set up a studio in his parents&#x27; house, at 15 Rue Ecosse (Schotlandstraat), Brussels. In 1925, he had his first solo exhibition, in Brussels.

Delvaux&#x27;s paintings of the late 1920s and early 1930s began to feature nudes in landscapes, and were strongly influenced by such Flemish Expressionists as Constant Permeke, Gustave De Smet, Frits Van den Berghe, and the palette colors of James Ensor. His nude figures and portraits from this period are posed somewhat stiffly, whether outdoors or in domestic surroundings indoors. Relatively few of his paintings from the late 1920s have survived, and Delvaux recorded his destruction of 50 of his canvases to re-use the frames.

In 1929, Delvaux first met Anne-Marie de Maertelaere, whom he nicknamed &quot;Tam&quot;, and they fell in love. However, his domineering mother forced him to separate from Tam, exacting his promise to never see her again. Delvaux was greatly saddened by this, and his paintings took on a more isolated, lonely, detached tone.

In 1932, Delvaux found fresh inspiration in visits to the Midi Fair () in Brussels, where the Spitzner Museum (), a collection of medical curiosities, displayed wax models of bizarrely deformed anatomical specimens and diseases, including syphilis. The exhibit also maintained a booth in which skeletons and a mechanically breathing Venus figure were displayed in a window with red velvet curtains. This spectacle fascinated Delvaux, supplying him with some of the motifs that would appear throughout his subsequent work.

His mother died on 31 December 1932.

A change of style around 1933 reflected the influence of the metaphysical art of Giorgio de Chirico, which he had first encountered in 1926 or 1927. Delvaux women wear elaborate costumes or are semi-nude, in scenes of classical ruins or dark forests.

In the mid-1930s Delvaux also began to adopt some of the motifs of his fellow Belgian René Magritte, as well as that painter&#x27;s deadpan style in rendering the most unexpected juxtapositions of otherwise ordinary objects. Delvaux would maintain a respectful but uneasy relationship with Magritte, who was his almost-exact contemporary. He also admired the work of his younger contemporary, Balthus.

Delvaux acknowledged his influences, saying of de Chirico, &quot;with him I realized what was possible, the climate that had to be developed, the climate of silent streets with shadows of people who can&#x27;t be seen, I&#x27;ve never asked myself if it&#x27;s surrealist or not.&quot;

In 1934, Delvaux joined Salvador Dalí, de Chirico, and Magritte in an exhibition entitled &quot;Minotaure&quot;, at the Palais des Beaux-Arts de Bruxelles. In 1936, he and Magritte had separate shows at the Palais, which received favorable reviews.

Although Delvaux associated for a period with the Belgian surrealist group, he did not consider himself &quot;a Surrealist in the scholastic sense of the word.&quot; As Marc Rombaut has written of the artist: &quot;Delvaux ... always maintained an intimate and privileged relationship to his childhood, which is the underlying motivation for his work and always manages to surface there. This &#x27;childhood,&#x27; existing within him, led him to the poetic dimension in art.&quot;

On 16 January 1937, his father died. In July that year, Delvaux married Suzanne Purnal; the artist later said it was purely a marriage of convenience. He made his first trip to Italy, and would return there the next year. Mermaids and ocean surfside scenes started to appear among his paintings.

Delvaux perfected his mature artistic style between 1937 and 1941, reflecting both his sublimated desires and the increasing anxiety of the times. The artist&#x27;s own continuing awkward presence in his paintings, along with skeletons and various male characters from Jules Verne novels, were a counterpoint to his idealized female nudes, who gradually became more relaxed in their elegant beauty.
When the Germans invaded and occupied Belgium in 1940, Delvaux retreated to Pas-de-Calais with his aunts for eight days, but then returned to Brussels. He spent the war years quietly at home continuing to paint, but exhibiting nothing in Belgium. His painting &quot;La ville inquiète&quot; (&quot;The Anxious City&quot;, 1941) reflects both the chaotic worries and the uncanny everyday routine of his environment.

Delvaux frequently visited the Museum of Natural Sciences in Brussels to sketch human skeletons. In 1943, Delvaux finished the first of what would become a series of articulated skeletons in his paintings, posed in lifelike stances and interacting with other skeletons or occasionally with nude women.

In the post-war years, Delvaux continued the productive period he had started under the German occupation, painting many works that would later establish his reputation.

In January 1945, Delvaux had a major retrospective show at the Palais des Beaux-Arts, including 57 large-scale canvases. &quot;Public and critical reception was mixed, divided between admiration and incomprehension.&quot;

In 1946, he experimented briefly with exaggerated perspectives and a flattened picture plane, as shown in &quot;Les cariatides&quot; (&quot;Caryatids&quot;) and &quot;La ville noire&quot; (&quot;Black City&quot;).

In 1947, the influential Julien Levy Gallery in New York City mounted a show of Delvaux paintings, which was well received by critics. However, two of his paintings had been seized by customs as obscene, and one of them was damaged.

In August 1947, Delvaux again met Tam in a chance encounter at a newsstand in Saint-Idesbald, and they resumed their close relationship. The next year, Delvaux divorced his first wife Suzanne and moved to a temporary new home with Tam. In 1951, the reunited couple built a small house/studio in the coastal dunes of Saint-Idesbald. The pair married on 25 October 1952, and would be inseparable for many years until Tam&#x27;s death in 1989.

In 1949, Delvaux experimented with tempera to paint a mermaid on the front of a friend&#x27;s house in Saint-Idesbald. However, since then the fresco has been largely erased by the effects of weathering.

From 1950 to 1962, Delvaux served as professor of &quot;monumental painting&quot; at the École Nationale Supérieure d&#x27;Arts et d&#x27;Architecture de La Cambre, Brussels. In the 1950s, he painted a series of crucifixions and deposition scenes enacted by skeletons. Some of his paintings from this period are almost monochromatic, showing more concern for line than for color.

In the late 1950s, he turned temporarily from painting nudes to producing a number of night scenes in which trains are observed by a little girl in a dress, viewed from behind. These compositions contained nothing overtly surrealistic, yet the unnatural clarity of moonlit detail is hallucinatory in effect. Trains had always been a subject of special interest to Delvaux, who never forgot the wonder he felt as a small child at the sight of the first electric trams in Brussels.

In 1952, Delvaux collaborated with Emile Salkin and three students from La Cambre to produce a wall mural at the gaming room in the Ostend &quot;Kursaal&quot;, portraying a Roman-style classical dancing scene with a large mermaid in a prone posture. In 1954–1956 Delvaux collaborated with Salkin for a series of wall panels at the house of Gilbert Périer in Brussels. They portrayed women in either contemporary or classical costume in Greco-Roman architectural settings, contrasting with one panel depicting an all-male dining table scene.

In 1954, Delvaux joined the 27th Venice Biennale, whose theme that year was &quot;Fantasy in Art&quot;. He exhibited his paintings of religious scenes enacted by skeletons, but the show was censored for heresy by Cardinal Roncalli (who would later become Pope John XXIII).

In 1956 Delvaux visited Greece, where classical architecture originated, the land of Homer and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. He also visited Italy, reinforcing his favored themes of classical settings and costumes.

In 1958, Delvaux led a team of La Cambre students in painting &quot;&quot; (&quot;Literary Map of Belgium&quot;) for the 1958 Brussels World’s Fair (Expo 58). It was a oil painting, depicting a map of Belgium and the locations where writers associated with the country were born, lived, or worked, including foreign authors such as Charlotte Brontë. The map shows various sites in Belgium&#x27;s towns and cities, and is decorated with flute players and mermaids painted by Delvaux. In 1976, Delvaux attended the formal transfer of the painting to a lecture hall at the (part of the Royal Library of Belgium) in Brussels, where it remains publicly visible today.

In 1959 Delvaux collaborated with Ysette Gabriels and Charles Van Deun to paint &quot;Le paradis terrestre&quot; (&quot;Earthly Paradise&quot;), a mural at the Palais des Congrès in Brussels (now part of the Square – Brussels Meeting Centre). It foregrounded women in classical garb outside a Roman-style villa, while in the far background (upper reaches of the mural) the figures were nude. The mural has been preserved and restored, but is located in an area now infrequently visible to the public. In 1960, he again worked with Gabriels to paint the mural &quot;La Genèse&quot; (&quot;Genesis&quot;) at the University of Liège Institute of Zoology (now l&#x27;Aquarium-Muséum de Liège or Dubuisson Aquarium). It shows a pastoral scene with grazing animals, female classical figures, and an androgynous reclining nude.

In 1963 he was named vice-director of the Académie Royale de Belgique, and then promoted to be its president in 1965.

In 1966, Delvaux began working with the 22-year-old model Danielle Caneel, using her slim figure as inspiration over the next 17 years in numerous drawings and studies. With a few exceptions, he did not depict her face or cropped brunette hair in his finished paintings, preferring to substitute idealized symmetrical facial features and long blonde hair. The 1960s and 1970s were a period of high productivity for his paintings, and also increasing international recognition of his art.

In 1969, Delvaux moved to Veurne (also called Furnes), but still spent much of his time at his studio in nearby Saint-Idesbald.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Delvaux&#x27;s eyesight gradually deteriorated. His brushwork became less precise and more impressionistic, and his colors became brighter and more vivid. His work became &quot;less anxious, quieter, and more meditative&quot;. His later paintings shed their longtime motifs, and focused increasingly on the female figure, often in multiples, and now interacting with each other more than the detached figures of earlier paintings. These paintings have been compared to the works of Odilon Redon and Marc Chagall.

In 1974, Delvaux, with assistance of Raymond Art, Fernand Flausch, Alain Denis, and M Huysmans, painted &quot;Le Voyage Légendaire&quot; (&quot;Legendary Voyage&quot;), measuring . Originally installed at the Casino de Chaudfontaine, it was later moved to the Casino de Knokke-le-Zoute. It shows a surreal outdoors panorama, depicting &quot;the cave, the thick forest, the naked or dressed girls, the trains and tracks meticulously illustrated in the small station, the lights and electricity poles, the moon, the mailbox&quot;.

In 1978, he collaborated with Raymond Art and Charles Van Deun to paint the monumental fresco wall mural &quot;Nos vieux trams bruxellois&quot; (&quot;Our Old Brussels Trams&quot;) in the Bourse-Beurs Brussels Metro station.

That same year, the Paul Delvaux Foundation was created with the approval of the King of Belgium; its primary goal was to create a museum dedicated to the artist. Tam&#x27;s health was starting to decline, but she wrote a note encouraging her husband to continue creating art for as long as he was able to.

In 1981, Delvaux met Andy Warhol in Brussels, who made several portraits of the aging artist. With the approval of the artist, Charles Van Deun purchased an old hotel/restaurant, Het Vlierhof, in Saint-Idesbald, to house the new museum.

On 26 June 1982, the Paul Delvaux Museum () opened, with the artist and his wife in attendance. The museum has acquired the world&#x27;s largest collection of paintings, watercolors, drawings, sketchbooks, and prints by Delvaux.

In 1984, Delvaux was appointed &quot;Chef de gare d&#x27;honneur de Louvain-La-Neuve&quot; (honorary stationmaster). Delvaux and Tam moved to a large house in Veurne. He visited his museum almost daily, and continued to create art, transitioning more to pencil, ink, and watercolor.

In 1986, Delvaux painted his last canvas, entitled &quot;Calypso&quot;.

In 1988, Delvaux left his studio in Saint-Idesbald to spend more time at home in Veurne with his ailing wife. He continued to make drawings, often at large scale, so he could still work on them despite his failing eyesight.

Tam died on 21 December 1989. At this point Delvaux completely abandoned creating artworks. He died in Veurne on 20 July 1994, and was buried there next to his beloved wife.

==Style and themes==

Delvaux usually painted very meticulously and deliberately, after doing numerous preparatory studies and drawings sometimes numbering in the dozens. In addition to these systematic studies, he also made a lesser number of &quot;spontaneous&quot; drawings as independent artworks, more expressive and improvisational in quality. Once he actually had started a major painting, he continued to modify his layout, erasing, moving, or replacing different elements to perfect his artwork. Over a long 60-year career, his perfectionism allowed him to release only around 450 paintings.

Delvaux became famous for paintings usually featuring one or several nude or semi-nude women who gaze languidly into space as if hypnotized, gesturing mysteriously, sometimes reclining incongruously in a train station or wandering through classical buildings. Sometimes they are accompanied by skeletons, businessmen in bowler hats, or puzzled scientists drawn from the stories of Jules Verne.

The settings are often commonplace moonlit urban scenes or classical ruins, depicting absurdist tableaus with a dream-like precision clarity. Delvaux sometimes would place himself in the scene, appearing either nude or fully-dressed in a business suit. Elements that appear frequently include mirrors, the full or crescent moon, candles, books, and flute players.

Delvaux would repeat variations on these themes for most of his long career, although some departures can be noted. Among them are his paintings of 1945–1947, rendered in a flattened style with distorted and forced perspective effects. At that time, he had felt trapped in a loveless marriage.

The gaze of the viewer is central to his paintings, often modulated by unusual viewpoints and multiple vanishing points, windows or openings, and mirrors. The perspectives are sometimes delineated by telegraph wires or steel rails crisscrossing or converging in the distance. Lines, whether straight and man-made, or the curved contours of the body, are often more important than the muted color palette.

In contrast to the cool, isolated detachment of his painted figures, Delvaux&#x27;s smaller drawings and sketches more frequently show figures touching, embracing, and interacting closely with each other.

Throughout the mature Delvaux artworks, certain motifs appear repeatedly:
*Trains, Trams, and Stations – Although replaced by electric trains, old-fashioned steam locomotives and rolling stock recur often. Longtime friend Paul-Aloïse De Bock commented on Delvaux&#x27;s thorough knowledge of the development of the Brussels tramway system, from his childhood&#x27;s horse-drawn trolleys to contemporary electric models, including details of tram bodywork and trackwork.
*Architectural Elements – Ancient Greek or Roman buildings, ruins, and architectural fragments appear, as well as early 20th-century urban structures.
*A Tribute to Women – Delvaux women are omnipresent in his work, but are disengaged and remote from the viewer, their expressionless gaze and focus elsewhere. They are usually nude or semi-nude, often adorned with gauze, feathers, floral headpieces, or elaborate jewelry. His future wife Tam appears repeatedly in sketches and drawings starting in the 1930s, but is replaced by more generic faces after their reunion and marriage in 1952.
*The Place of Men – Delvaux men often appear absent-minded, old-fashioned, or even ridiculous. Due to the lack of a convenient model, the artist often portrayed himself for male nudes. Other characters include the &quot;ordinary man in the street&quot; in a business suit, and the geologist (Otto Lidenbrock) and astronomer (Palmyrin Rosette) from novels by Jules Verne. After 1943, male figures appear infrequently, but his classic male archetypes reappear in his reprised masterwork &quot;Hommage à Jules Verne&quot; (&quot;Homage to Jules Verne&quot;, 1971).
*Skeletons as Architecture of Life – Delvaux paradoxically uses human skeletons as an affirmation of life, sometimes posing them more expressively than his dispassionate nudes.

<text>Prataprao Gujar (also &quot;Kudtoji Gujar&quot;, ; – 24 February 1674) was a Maratha general who served as the 3rd Senapati of the Maratha Empire during the reign of Chhatrapati Shivaji. He commanded the Maratha Army until 1674.

==Military career==
Prataprao Gujar raided Khandesh in 1670 and captured some forts from the Mughals in Baglan. He plundered Bahadurpur and, riding into Berar, looted the city of Karanja. From this time, Shivaji began levying chauth from the Mughal territories through which he passed.

===Victory at Salher===

At the Battle of Salher, Prataprao Gujar routed a sizable Mughal army. The Maratha victory at Salher is seen as a watershed in their military campaigns against the formidable Mughal army.

===Confrontation with the Adil Shahis===
Prataprao Gujar was later dispatched to confront the Adil Shah&#x27;s invading army under the command of Bahlol Khan. During the battle, Bahlol Khan was besieged by the Maratha army and taken as a prisoner. However, upon Khan&#x27;s promise not to invade Maratha territory again, Prataprao released Bahlol Khan (around 15 April 1673). 

However, Bahalol Khan returned again with a larger army which enraged Prataprao Gujar and he decided to attack Bahalol Khan on 24 February 1674. According to the description given by Krishnaji Ananta and the letter of the English interpreter Narayan Shenvi, dated 4 April 1674, &quot;Prataprao attacked Bahalol Khan&#x27;s camp in Nesari with only six of his trusted battle-hardened commanders. It was a daring surgical strike which killed many in the enemy camp and demoralised the Bahlol&#x27;s army. During this daring raid, Prataprao and his six lieutenants also got martyred but only after inflicting huge damage to the enemy camp&quot;.

==Popular culture==
Them Marathi poet Kusumagraj wrote the song &quot;&quot; about this heroic battle, which was sung by Lata Mangeshkar. The commercial drama written by Bashir Momin (&quot;Kavathekar&quot;) was also based on it. The inaugural performance of the play was staged by Malganga Natya Niketan on 19 May 1977. Seeing the encouraging response to the play, Kavathekar converted the play into a shorter version called , which was then performed and popularized by various Tamasha Troupes in rural Maharashtra.

<text>Rok Petrovič (5 February 1966 – 16 September 1993) was a Yugoslav and Slovenian alpine skier.

Petrovič was born in Ljubljana, Yugoslavia, the son of Zdenka Steiner and Krešimir Petrović, a well known sports psychologist of Croatian origin. His first success in alpine ski racing was the 1983 Junior World Championship slalom title in Sestriere, Italy.

After this he rapidly advanced up the world slalom rankings. In the 1985–86 Alpine Skiing World Cup season, he was practically unbeatable in slalom, his competition left to wait for rare mistakes in his highly aggressive and That season he won 5 races, is second in St. Anton, Austria and third in Geilo, Norway, easily winning the World Cup slalom title and becoming the first Yugoslav with a crystal globe.

After his championship-winning season, Petrovič was unable to recapture his winning form, the only hint of his championship season being a second place behind his teammate Bojan Križaj at the unforgettable race in Kranjska Gora next season. He finished eighth in the 1988 Winter Olympic Games giant slalom.

Due to his lack of winning results, he quit skiing in 1988 and began studies at the College of Sports in Ljubljana. He graduated in 1991 and continued with post-graduate study. He was to defend his M.Sc. thesis in the autumn of 1993, but shortly before defending his thesis he took a short break at the Croatian island Korčula and drowned in a diving accident.

Altogether he won 5 World Cup races, all in slalom and all in his champion season in 1985-86:

<text>The Biju Janata Dal (BJD) is an Indian regional political party with significant influence in the state of Odisha. It was founded by the former minister of mines and minerals of the Republic of India Naveen Patnaik on 26 December 1997 as a breakaway faction from the Janata Dal. The BJD is led by its founder as president of the party. The headquarters of the party is located in Forest Park, Bhubaneswar.

<text>Fjölsvinnsmál (Old Norse: &#x27;The Lay of Fjölsvinn&#x27;) is the second of two Old Norse poems commonly published under the title &quot;Svipdagsmál&quot; &quot;The Lay of Svipdagr&quot;. These poems are found together in several 17th-century paper manuscripts with &quot;Fjölsvinnsmál&quot;. In at least three of these manuscripts, the poems appear in reverse order and are separated by a third eddic poem titled &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot;. For a long time, the connection between the two poems was not realized, until in 1854 Svend Grundtvig pointed out a connection between the story told in &quot;Gróagaldr&quot; and the first part of the medieval Scandinavian ballad of &quot;Ungen Sveidal&quot;/&quot;Herr Svedendal&quot;/&quot;Hertig Silfverdal&quot; (TSB A 45, DgF 70, SMB 18, NMB 22). Then in 1856, Sophus Bugge noticed that the last part of the ballad corresponded to &quot;Fjölsvinnsmál&quot;. Bugge wrote about this connection in &quot;Forhandlinger i Videnskabs-Selskabet i Christiania 1860&quot;, calling the two poems together &quot;Svipdagsmál&quot;. Subsequent scholars have accepted this title.

In the first poem, Svipdagr enlists the aid of his dead mother, Gróa, a witch, to assist him in the completion of a task set by his cruel stepmother.

At the commencement of &quot;Fjölsvinnsmál&quot;, Svipdagr has arrived at a castle on a mountain top. There he encounters a watchman, Fjölsviðr, who tells him to be gone before asking him his name. Svipdagr conceals it, only revealing it later in the poem.

A game of question and answers ensues, wherein Svipdagr learns that Menglöð lives in the castle guarded by Fjölsviðr, and that the castle may not be entered by any save one: Svipdagr. He gives his true name and the gates are opened and Menglöð greets Svipdagr.

<doc id="665190" wikidata="Q2509627" url="?curid=665190" title="Vavasour">
<text>A vavasour (also vavasor; Old French &quot;vavassor&quot;, &quot;vavassour&quot;; Modern French &quot;vavasseur&quot;; Italian &quot;valvassore&quot;, &quot;varvassore&quot;; Late Latin &quot;vavassor&quot;) is a term in feudal law. A vavasour was the vassal or tenant of a baron, one who held his tenancy under a baron, and who also had tenants under him.

==Definition and derivation==
The derivation of the word is obscure. It may be derived from &quot;vassi ad valvas&quot; (at the folding-doors, valvae), i.e. servants of the royal antechamber. Du Cange regarded it merely as an obscure variant of &quot;vassus&quot;, probably from &quot;vassus vassorum&quot; &quot;vassal of the vassals&quot;. Alternative spellings include vavasor, valvasor, vasseur, vasvassor, oavassor, and others.

In its most general sense the word thus indicated a mediate vassal, i.e. one holding a fief under a vassal. The word was, however, applied at various times to the most diverse ranks in the feudal hierarchy, being used practically as the synonym of vassal. Thus tenants-in-chief of the crown are described by Emperor Conrad II as &quot;valvassores majores&quot;, as distinguished from mediate tenants, &quot;valvassores minores&quot;.

Gradually the term without qualification was found convenient for describing sub-vassals, tenants-in-chief being called &quot;capitanei&quot; or &quot;barones&quot;; but its implication, however, still varied in different places and times. Bracton ranked the &quot;magnates seu valvassores&quot; between barons and knights; for him they are &quot;men of great dignity,&quot; and in this order they are found in a charter of King Henry II of England (1166). But in the &quot;regestum&quot; of King Philip II Augustus of France we find that five vavassors are reckoned as the equivalent of one knight. Finally, Du Cange quotes two charters, one of 1187, another of 1349, in which vavassors are clearly distinguished from nobles.

Vavasours subdivide again to vassals, exchanging land and cattle, human or otherwise, against fealty. - &quot;Motley&quot;.

==In fiction==
* Used as a Christian name (Colonel Vavasour Devorax) in the novel &quot;A Crowning Mercy&quot; by Bernard Cornwell and Susannah Kells (aka Judy Cornwell).
* Used twice as a surname by Dorothy L. Sayers, once in &quot;Murder Must Advertise&quot; (Miss Ethel Vavasour, Jim Tallboy&#x27;s girlfriend), and once in &quot;Have His Carcase&quot; (Maurice Vavasour, a pseudonym of the murderer).
* Used as a surname by John Banville in &quot;The Sea&quot; (Miss Vavasour).
* Used in Arthurian Romances, by Chretien de Troyes in &quot;Perceval: The Story of the Grail&quot; (Everyman Classics 1991). &quot;You can say that the vavasor who fitted on your spur taught and instructed you.&quot; p. 397.
* Vavasor is a surname in Anthony Trollope&#x27;s &quot;Can You Forgive Her?&quot;
* Used in &quot;The Sandman&quot; graphic novel (1989, issue 10) as well as its television adaptation (2022, episode 7)
* Vavasor is the surname of a &quot;Some Girls&quot; character - Holli Jane Vavasor, played by Natasha Jonas.
* Used as the Christian name of Sir Vavasour Firebrace, a proud baronet, in Disraeli&#x27;s &quot;Sybil&quot;.
* Used in William Morris&#x27; The Well at the World&#x27;s End where King Peter&#x27;s subjects are described as &quot;sturdy vavassors&quot; who would not accept &quot;masterful doings&quot;.

==In popular culture==
In the 1980s TV series &quot;The Paper Chase&quot;, Season 2, Episode 16 (&quot;My Dinner with Kingsfield&quot;), Contract Law Professor Charles W. Kingsfield plays the word &quot;vavasor&quot; and earns 60 points in a Scrabble game with his student James T. Hart while staying at Hart&#x27;s residence during a snowstorm that has immobilized Kingsfield&#x27;s car. He defines the word to Hart (who has never heard it before) as a &quot;medieval term for &#x27;tenant slightly below a baron.

<text>Martine is the title character in a series of books for children originally written in French by the Belgians Marcel Marlier and Gilbert Delahaye and published by Casterman. The first album, &quot;Martine à la ferme&quot; (&quot;Martine at the farm&quot;), was published in 1954, followed by 59 other books, which have been translated into many different languages. The book series has sold about 100 million copies and is one of the best-selling book series. When the author Gilbert Delahaye died in 1997, Jean-Louis Marlier, the son of Marcel Marlier, continued to write the stories. The series ended in 2011 when the illustrator Marcel Marlier died at the age of 80. The last book is the 60th, &quot;Martine et le prince mystérieux&quot; (&quot;Martine and the Mysterious Prince&quot;), published in 2010. The albums continuing to be published.

The character was renamed for different languages and markets. For examples, Martine was named &quot;Emma&quot; for English-speaking audiences in Europe for video games and &quot;Debbie&quot; for the U.S. market.

== Other media ==
A 3D animated series directed by Claude Allix and produced by Les Armateurs, recounting the adventures of Martine and her friends, was launched on August 27, 2012 on M6, and in Quebec from September 15, 2012 on Télé-Québec.

Two video games were released based on the character: &quot;Emma at the Farm&quot; and &quot;Emma in the Mountains&quot;, both for the Nintendo DS handheld system. The games are based on the first and eighth books respectively. The games were announced for release in the U.S. in 2008.

== Albums ==
== Martine in other languages ==
When translating children&#x27;s books, foreign/unknown names are usually replaced by popular names from the target language. For example, the French-speaking Martine changed to &quot;Tiny&quot; in Dutch.

<text>The Handley Page HP.137 Jetstream is a small twin-turboprop airliner, with a pressurised fuselage. The aircraft was designed to meet the requirements of the United States commuter and regional airline market. The design was later improved and built by British Aerospace as the BAe Jetstream 31 and BAe Jetstream 32, featuring different turboprop engines.

==Development==
Handley Page was in an awkward position in the 1960s, wishing to remain independent of the &quot;big two&quot; British companies (Hawker Siddeley and the British Aircraft Corporation), but without the money needed to develop a large new airliner that would keep it in the market. After studying the market it decided that its next product would be a highly competitive small airliner instead, filling a niche it identified for a 12–18 seat high-speed design. Compared to its three closest rivals, the Beechcraft King Air, Aero Commander Turbo Commander and Swearingen Merlin it offered &quot;more capacity, better range-payload, higher speed and greater comfort&quot;. American salesman and modification engineer Jack Riley claimed to have written the design specifications. The design garnered intense interest in the US when it was first introduced, and an order for 20 had been placed even before the drawings were complete. Charles Joy was responsible for the design.

The original design dates from 1965 as a 12-seat (six rows with a centre aisle) aircraft. The aircraft was a low-wing, high-tail monoplane of conventional layout. Considerable attention was paid to streamlining in order to improve performance, which led to one of the design&#x27;s more distinctive features, a long nose profile. The fuselage had a circular cross-section to minimize the structural weight required for the pressurisation which enabled much higher altitude and consequent higher speed and comfort than competing unpressurised designs. The aisle between the seats had a 5 ft 11in headroom but the main spar formed a step in the aisle, which was a tripping hazard.

Final assembly took place in a new factory at the Radlett aerodrome, but large portions of the structure were subcontracted, including complete wings being built by Scottish Aviation at Prestwick, Scotland and the tail section by Northwest Industries of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The original design used Turbomeca Astazou XVI engines of approximately 840 hp (626 kW), and flew on 18 August 1967 as the Jetstream 1. Throughout the test program the engines proved to be a weak point, being generally underpowered for the design, and surprisingly temperamental for what was then a mature and widely used turboshaft design. Testing was eventually moved to the Turboméca factory airfield in the south of France, both to allow faster turnaround with engine work, and in order to improve the schedule by taking advantage of the better weather.

In order to improve sales prospects in the US, the fifth prototype was fitted with the US-built Garrett TPE-331 in place of the French Astazou. Changing to the US-built engine was enough to allow the United States Air Force to consider it for cargo use. It eventually placed an order for 11, fitted with a cargo door and accommodation for 12 passengers or six stretcher cases, to be known as the C-10A, or Jetstream 3M. The US Air Force cancelled its order in October 1969 citing late delivery.

The first production model Jetstream 1 flew on 6 December 1968, and over the next year 36 would be delivered. However, by this point Handley Page had given up on the original engine, and the Jetstream 2 was launched with the larger 965 hp (720 kW) Astazou XVI, starting deliveries in late 1969. The late delivery and engine problems had driven development costs to over £13 million, far more than the original £3 million projections. Only three Jetstream 2s would be completed before Handley Page went bankrupt, and the production line was eventually shut down in 1970.

There was enough interest in the design that it was first picked up by a collaboration of investors and Scottish Aviation which formed a company called &quot;Jetstream Aircraft&quot; to produce the aircraft. Initially production moved to Sywell Aerodrome in Northamptonshire, the CEO being Bill Bright. A further ten Jetstream 1s were produced by this team. Scottish Aviation continued production of the Jetstream 2 as well, although referring to it as the Jetstream 200. In February 1972, 26 Jetstream 201s were ordered by the Royal Air Force, which used them as multi-engine trainers as the Jetstream T.1. Fourteen of these were modified as observer trainers for the Royal Navy, receiving the designation Jetstream T2.

<text>The Rashtrapati Bhavan (, ISO: &quot;Rāṣṭrapati Bhavana&quot;; ; formerly Viceroy&#x27;s House (1931–1947) and Government House (1947–1950)) is the official residence of the president of India at the western end of Rajpath, Raisina Hill in New Delhi. It was constructed during the British Raj.

Rashtrapati Bhavan may refer to only the 340-room main building that has the president&#x27;s official residence, including reception halls, guest rooms and offices, also called the mansion; it may also refer to the entire 130-hectare (320-acre) Presidential Estate that additionally includes the presidential gardens, large open spaces, residences of bodyguards and staff, stables, other offices and utilities within its perimeter walls. In terms of area, it is the second largest residence of any head of state in the world after the Quirinal Palace in Italy.

The other presidential homes are the Rashtrapati Nilayam in Hyderabad, (Telangana), Rashtrapati Ashiana in Dehradun, (Uttarakhand), Rashtrapati Niwas, Mashobra and Rashtrapati Niwas in Shimla, (Himachal Pradesh).

==History==
The Governor-General of India resided at Government House in Calcutta until the shift of the imperial capital to Delhi. Lord Wellesley, who is reputed to have said that ‘India should be governed from a palace, not from a country house’, ordered the construction of this grand mansion between 1799 and 1803 and in 1912, the Governor of Bengal took up residence there. The decision to build a residence in New Delhi for the British viceroy was taken after it was decided during the Delhi Durbar in December 1911 that the capital of India would be relocated from Calcutta to Delhi. When the plan for a new city, New Delhi, adjacent to the end south of Old Delhi, was developed after the Delhi Durbar, the new palace for the viceroy of India was given an enormous size and prominent position. About of land was acquired to begin the construction of Viceroy&#x27;s House, as it was originally called, and the adjacent Secretariat Building between 1911 and 1916 by relocating Raisina and Malcha villages that existed there and their 300 families under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894.
The British architect Edwin Lutyens, a major contributor to the city-planning process, was given the primary architectural responsibility. The completed Governor-General&#x27;s palace turned out very similar to the original sketches which Lutyens sent Herbert Baker, from Shimla, on 14 June 1912. Lutyens&#x27; design is grandly classical overall, with colours and details inspired by Indo-Saracenic architecture. Lutyens and Baker, who had been assigned to work on Viceroy&#x27;s House and the Secretariats, began on friendly terms. Baker had been assigned to work on the two secretariat buildings which were in front of the Viceroy&#x27;s House. The original plan was to have Viceroy&#x27;s House on the top of Raisina Hill, with the secretariats lower down. It was later decided to build it 400 yards back and put both buildings on top of the plateau.

Lutyens campaigned for its fixing but was not able to get it to be changed. Lutyens wanted to make a long inclined grade to Viceroy&#x27;s House with retaining walls on either side. While this would give a view of the house from further back, it would also cut through the square between the secretariat buildings. The committee with Lutyens and Baker established in January 1914 said the grade was to be no steeper than 1 in 25, though it eventually was changed to 1 in 22, a steeper gradient which made it more difficult to see the Viceroy&#x27;s palace. While Lutyens knew about the gradient and the possibility that the Viceroy&#x27;s palace would be obscured by the road, it is thought that Lutyens did not fully realise how little the front of the house would be visible. In 1916 the Imperial Delhi committee dismissed Lutyens&#x27;s proposal to alter the gradient. Lutyens thought Baker was more concerned with making money and pleasing the government, rather than making a good architectural design. The land was owned by Basakha Singh and mostly Sir Sobha Singh.

Lutyens travelled between India and England almost every year for twenty years and worked on the construction of the Viceroy&#x27;s House in both countries. Lutyens reduced the building from to because of budget restrictions.

The gardens were initially designed and laid out in Mughal style by William Robert Mustoe who was influenced by the Vicereine Lady Hardinge who in turn had sought inspiration in the book by Constance Villiers-Stuart in her &quot;Gardens of the Great Mughals&quot; (1913). The designs underwent changes and alterations under subsequent viceroys and after Indian Independence. After independence, it was renamed as Government House.

When Chakravarti Rajagopalachari assumed office as the first India-born Governor General of India and became the occupant of this palace, he preferred to stay in a few rooms in the former Guest Wing, which is now the family wing of the President; he converted the then Viceroy&#x27;s apartments into the Guest Wing, where visiting heads of state stay while in India.

On 26 January 1950, when Rajendra Prasad became the first President of India and occupied this building, it was renamed Rashtrapati Bhavan – the President&#x27;s House.

==Architecture==
=== Design ===
Consisting of four floors and 340 rooms, with a floor area of , it was built using 700 million bricks and of stone with little steel.

The design of the building fell into the period of the Edwardian Baroque, a time at which emphasis was placed on the use of heavy classical motifs to emphasise power. The design process of the mansion was long, complicated and politically charged. Lutyens&#x27; early designs were all starkly classical and entirely European in style, although he wished to do it in classical Indian style – India never had a uniform architecture for public use. In the post-Mutiny era, however, it was decided that sensitivity must be shown to the local surroundings to better integrate the building within its political context, and after much political debate, Lutyens conceded to incorporating local Indo-Saracenic motifs, albeit in a rather superficial decoration form on the skin of the building.

Various Indian elements were added to the building. These included several circular stone basins on top of the building, as water features are an important part of Indian architecture. There was also a traditional Indian chujja or chhajja, which occupied the place of a frieze in classical architecture; it was a sharp, thin, protruding element which extended from the building, and created deep shadows. It blocks harsh sunlight from the windows and also shields the windows from heavy rain during the monsoon season. On the roofline were several chuttris, which helped to break up the flatness of the roofline not covered by the dome. Lutyens appropriated some Indian design elements but used them sparingly and effectively throughout the building.

The column has a &quot;distinctly peculiar crown on top, a glass star springing out of bronze lotus blossom&quot;.

There were pierced screens in red sandstone, called jalis or jaalis, inspired by Rajasthani designs. The front of the palace, on the east side, has twelve unevenly spaced massive columns with the Delhi Order capitals, a &quot;nonce order&quot; Lutyens invented for this building, with Ashokan details. The capitals have a fusion of acanthus leaves with the four pendant Indian bells. The bells are similar in style to Indian Hindu and Buddhist temples, the idea is inspired by a Jain temple at Moodabidri in Karnataka.

One bell is on each corner at the top of the column. As there is an ancient Indian belief that bells signalled the end of a dynasty, it was said that as the bells were silent British rule in India would not end.
Whereas previous British examples of so-called Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture had mostly grafted elements from Mughal architecture onto essentially Western carcasses, Lutyens drew also from the much earlier Buddhist Mauryan art. This can be seen in the Dehli Order, and in the main dome, where the drum below has decoration recalling the railings around early Buddhist stupas such as Sanchi. There is also the presence of Mughal and European colonial architectural elements. Overall the structure is distinctly different from other contemporary British Colonial symbols, although other New Delhi buildings, such as the Secretariat Building, New Delhi, mainly by Herbert Baker, have similarities e.g. both are built with cream and red Dholpur sandstone.

Lutyens added several small personal elements to the house, such as an area in the garden walls and two ventilator windows on the stateroom to look like the glasses which he wore. The Viceregal Lodge was completed largely by 1929, and (along with the rest of New Delhi) inaugurated officially in 1931. Between 1932 and 1933 important decorations were added, especially in the ballroom, and executed by the Italian painter Tommaso Colonnello.
It has 355 decorated rooms and a floor area of 200,000 square feet (19,000 m2). The structure includes 700 million bricks and 3.5 million cubic feet (85,000 m³) of stone, with only minimal usage of steel. Lutyens established ateliers in Delhi and Lahore to employ local craftsmen. The chief engineer of the project was Sir Teja Singh Malik, and four main contractors included Sir Sobha Singh.

== Layout plan ==
The layout plan of the building is designed around a massive square with multiple courtyards and open inner areas within. The plan called for two wings; one for the Viceroy and residents and another for guests. The residence wing is a separate four-storey house in itself, with its court areas within. This wing was so large that the last Indian governor-general, Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, opted to live in the smaller guest wing, a tradition followed by subsequent presidents. The original residence wing is now used primarily for state receptions and as a guest wing for visiting heads of state.

===Halls and rooms===
==== Gantantra Mandap ====
Gantantra Mandap (formerly: &quot;Durbar Hall&quot;) is situated directly under the double-dome of the main building. Known as the &quot;Throne Room&quot; before independence, it had two separate thrones for the Viceroy and Vicereine. Since Indian Independence, a single high chair for the President is kept here under a Belgian glass chandelier hanging from a height of 33 m. The flooring of the hall is made of chocolate-coloured Italian marble. The columns in Gantantra Mandap are made in Delhi Order which combines vertical lines with the motif of a bell. The vertical lines from the column were also used in the frieze around the room, which could not have been done with one of the traditional Greek orders of columns. The columns are made from yellow Jaisalmer marble, with a thick line running along the centre.

Gantantra Mandap has a capacity of 500 people and it is here in this building that Jawaharlal Nehru took the oath of office of Prime Minister from Lord Mountbatten at 8.30 am on 15 August 1947.

==== Ashoka Mandap ====
Ashoka Mandap (formerly: &quot;Ashoka Hall&quot;) is a rectangular room of 32×20 m. It was originally built as a state ballroom with wooden flooring. The Persian painting on its ceiling depicts a royal hunting expedition led by King Fateh Ali Shah of Persia. The walls have fresco paintings.

=== Dome ===

The dome, in the middle, reflects both Indian and British styles. In the centre is a tall copper-faced dome, surmounting a very tall drum in several sections, which stands out from the rest of the building. The dome is exactly in the middle of the diagonals between the four corners of the building. It is more than twice the height of the building itself and combines classical and Indian styles. Lutyens considered the Pantheon in Rome as a model when designing the dome, although the exterior of the dome was also modelled partly after the early Buddhist stupas.

== Amrit Udyan (Mughal Gardens) ==
Amrit Udyan (meaning: &quot;The Garden of the Holy Nectar&quot;) is a garden situated at the back of the Rashtrapati Bhavan. Formerly known as the &quot;Mughal Gardens&quot;, it was rechristened by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union Government to &quot;Amrit Udyan&quot; in January 2023 after the new name was proposed by President Draupadi Murmu as part of the 75th Anniversary of Indian Independence celebrations. The garden incorporates both Mughal and English landscaping styles and feature a great variety of flowers and trees. The Rashtrapati Bhavan gardens are open to the public in February–March every year during &quot;Udyanotsav&quot;.

Main garden: Two channels intersecting at right angles running in the cardinal directions divide this garden into a grid of squares: a &quot;charbagh&quot;. There are six lotus-shaped fountains at the crossings of these channels, rising to a height of . There are bird tables for feeding grain to wild birds.

Terrace garden: There are two longitudinal strips of the garden, at a higher level on each side of the Main Garden, forming the Northern and Southern boundaries. The plants grown are the same as in the Main Garden. At the centre of both of the strips is a fountain, which falls inwards, forming a well. On the Western tips are located two gazebos and on the Eastern tips are two ornately designed sentry posts.
Long Garden (or the Purdah Garden): This is located to the West of the Main Garden, and runs along each side of the central pavement which goes to the circular garden. Enclosed in walls about 12 feet high, this is predominantly a rose garden. It has 16 square rose beds encased in low hedges. There is a red sandstone pergola in the centre over the central pavement which is covered with Rose creepers, Petrea, Bougainvillea and vines. The walls are covered with creepers like jasmine, Rhynchospermum, Tecoma Grandiflora, Bignonia Vanista, Adenoclyma, Echitice, Parana Paniculata. Along the walls are planted the China Orange trees.

==Museum==

In July 2014, a museum inside Rashtrapati Bhavan was inaugurated by then President of India Pranab Mukherjee. The museum helps visitors to get an inside view of the Rashtrapati Bhavan, its art, architecture and get educated about lives of past presidents. The second phase was inaugurated in 2016 by the President Pranab Mukherjee and the Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The museum has been built under the guidance of Saroj Ghose.

==Restoration==
The first restoration project at the Rashtrapati Bhavan was started in 1985 and ended in 1989, during which the Ashoka Hall was stripped of its later additions and restored to its original state by the architectural restorer Sunita Kohli. The second restoration project, begun in 2010, involved Charles Correa and Sunita Kohli.

<text>George Burt (2 October 1816 – 18 April 1894) was a public-works contractor and businessman from Swanage, England, who managed the construction company Mowlem, that was founded by his uncle John Mowlem.

==Career==
George&#x27;s father was Robert (1788–1847), a stone merchant, whose stone and coal business was located in Swanage High Street. His mother was Letitia born Manwell (1786–1861), sister-in-law to John Mowlem who was a struggling workman in London at the time of George&#x27;s birth. George, as did his uncle before him, worked in the quarries around Swanage. George had five siblings, Elizabeth Letitia (1818–1889), Robert Henry (1821–1876), Charles (1823-1890), Francis Alfred (1825-1898) and Susannah Ann, &#x27;Susy&#x27; (1829–1871).

In 1835 George Burt moved to London to join Mowlem&#x27;s business, becoming a partner in 1844, and managing the business after Mowlem&#x27;s semi-retirement the following year. He married Elizabeth Hudson in 1841, and the couple had five children. Elizabeth Sophia (1843–1880), John Mowlem (1845–1894), Annie (1846–1918), Emma Rust (1849–1910) and George (1851-1919).

Upon taking over the Mowlem&#x27;s company, Burt substantially expanded the firm&#x27;s operations. Surviving the lean years during the financial crisis of 1866-7, his company became a major public-works contractor and won the contract for Queen Victoria Street in the City of London (1869), followed by Billingsgate Market (1874-7), and the City of London School in 1880 on the new Victoria Embankment, amongst others.

Burt, like his uncle, maintained an interest in Swanage, establishing gas and waterworks, developing the Durlston estate, and lived in a large house called &quot;Purbeck House&quot;, now a hotel, on the main street. He and his wife bought the house for £550 and lived in it for 17 years. The porch is made of white Cornish granite, the mosaic floor is copied from the pavement in Queen Victoria Street, London and some of the tiles are from the Palace of Westminster. The Swanage suburb of Durlston was conceived of and developed by Burt. However it was never completed, part of the land originally intended for the development is now Durlston Country Park. Burt was responsible for the erection of the Prince Albert Memorial in 1862, which was the first civic memorial to the Prince.
Many architecturally interesting buildings and monuments were scavenged as a result of the company&#x27;s construction work on prestigious projects in London, and re-erected by Burt in Swanage and Durlston. The 1670 porch for the Mercers&#x27; Hall now adorns Swanage town hall, and a clock tower commemorating the Duke of Wellington which once stood at the Southwark end of London Bridge is now a feature of Swanage seafront. More prosaically, many of Swanage&#x27;s cast iron bollards were originally made for London boroughs, and still carry their names.

George Burt was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. Control of the company passed to his descendants Sir John Mowlem Burt (1845–1918) and Sir George Mowlem Burt (1884–1964).

<text>Libra is a 1988 novel by Don DeLillo that describes the life of Lee Harvey Oswald and his participation in a fictional CIA conspiracy to assassinate President John F. Kennedy. The novel blends historical fact with fictional supposition.

&quot;Libra&quot; received critical acclaim and earned DeLillo the inaugural Irish Times International Fiction Prize, as well as a nomination for the 1988 National Book Award for Fiction.

== Plot ==
The book follows two related but separate narrative threads: episodes from Oswald&#x27;s life from his childhood until the assassination and his death, and the actions of other participants in the conspiracy. A secondary parallel story follows Nicholas Branch, a CIA archivist of more recent times assigned the monumental task of piecing together the disparate fragments of Kennedy&#x27;s death.

Oswald is portrayed as a misfit antihero, whose overtly communist political views cause him difficulties fitting into American society. Raised by a single mother in the Bronx, Oswald enlists in the military in the 1950s and is stationed at the Naval Air Facility Atsugi in Japan, where he amuses his fellow marines with his earnest left-wing ideology. Oswald defects to the Soviet Union after the end of his service and is interviewed by the KGB about the U-2 reconnaissance planes he observed at Atsugi, although he is unable to furnish much useful information. Following a suicide attempt, Oswald is moved to Minsk, where he works in a factory and meets a young woman, Marina, whom he marries. In the early 1960s, Oswald and Marina relocate to Texas.

Concurrently in the novel, a cadre of CIA agents disillusioned by Kennedy&#x27;s perceived failure to adequately support the Bay of Pigs invasion hatch a plot to stage an assassination attempt and blame it on the Cuban government. The chief conspirators in the CIA are Win Everett, Lawrence Parmenter and TJ Mackey. The conspiracy grows to encompass several largely independent factions, including organized crime figures in New Orleans and a contingent of Cuban exiles in Miami. Although at first they planned to intentionally miss the President, at some point it is decided that the gunman should aim to kill.

After Oswald&#x27;s return from the Soviet Union, he comes to the attention of the conspirators, who realize that his history of public support for communism makes him a perfect scapegoat. They make contact with him and guide him along the path to the assassination. Oswald also meets a fellow serviceman in Dallas who has become a black nationalist, and the two men attempt an assassination of the far-right General Edwin Walker in his living room.

On November 22, 1963, as President Kennedy&#x27;s motorcade is passing through Dealey Plaza in downtown Dallas, Oswald shoots at him from the Texas School Book Depository, while a small group of Cuban exiles fires from behind the grassy knoll. Oswald is able to escape the scene of the crime because, as an employee of the Depository, the police do not identify him as a suspect. Later that afternoon, he shoots a Dallas patrolman who stops him for suspicious behavior. Oswald goes to a movie theater where the CIA conspiracy had planned to have him killed, but before they can do so he is apprehended by the Dallas police. A few days later, Oswald is murdered in police custody by Jack Ruby, a nightclub owner with underworld connections who was manipulated into killing Oswald by the conspirators.

At the end of the novel, Oswald is buried under an alias in a grave in Fort Worth in a small ceremony attended by his immediate family members.

== Historicity==
DeLillo has stated that &quot;Libra&quot; is not a nonfiction novel due to its inclusion of fictional characters and speculative plot elements. Nevertheless, the broad outline of Oswald&#x27;s life, including his teenage years in New York City, his military service, his use of the alias &quot;Hidell&quot;, and his defection to the Soviet Union are all historically accurate. Both the Warren Commission and the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations implicated Oswald in the attempted assassination of General Walker. Many other characters in the novel, including FBI agent Guy Banister, Oswald&#x27;s friend George de Mohrenschildt, and his wife Marina were real people. In an author&#x27;s note at the close of the book, DeLillo writes that he has &quot;made no attempt to furnish factual answers to any questions raised by the assassination.&quot;

The Warren Commission found that Oswald acted alone, while the House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded that Kennedy&#x27;s assassination was likely the result of a conspiracy.

== Themes ==
The character Nicholas Branch, tasked with writing the secret official CIA history of the assassination, concludes that the effort will be never-ending and the whole truth ultimately unknowable. For DeLillo, the Kennedy assassination was a turning point in American history that shattered the country&#x27;s sense in the postwar era of a common reality and purpose. The medium of fiction allows the reader to reclaim some of the balance and coherence that history lacks.

The novel refers to the report of the Warren Commission as the novel that &quot;James Joyce would have written if he&#x27;d moved to Iowa City and lived to be a hundred,&quot; as it comprises an almost encyclopedic picture of American life in the 1950s and 1960s comparable to the detailed depiction of Dublin in Joyce&#x27;s novels.

The book&#x27;s title comes from Oswald&#x27;s astrological sign, and, as a picture of a scale, symbolizes for Branch the outside forces of history weighing in on Oswald&#x27;s fate as well as the fate of the entire assassination plot. According to DeLillo, the scale also hints at how &quot;a man could tip either way&quot; with regard to committing the ultimate crime, and suggests a man torn between conflicting ideas and impulses, exemplified by the tension between his service in the United States military and his communist beliefs.

==Reception==
&quot;Libra&quot; was acclaimed by book critics. Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, novelist Anne Tyler referred to the book as DeLillo&#x27;s &quot;richest&quot; novel and said that the &quot;herringbone plot line serves to make the most humdrum occurrence seem suddenly meaningful, laden with dark purpose.&quot; She praised the author as &quot;inventing, with what seems uncanny perception, the interior voice that each character might use to describe his own activities. [...] That Mr. DeLillo has been able to make his readers see the story the same way - that finally we&#x27;re interested less in the physical events of the assassination than in the pitiable and stumbling spirit underlying them - proves &quot;Libra&quot; to be a triumph.&quot;

A &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; reviewer wrote, &quot;The novel bears dissection on many levels, but is, taken whole, a seamless, brilliant work of compelling fiction. What makes &quot;Libra&quot; so unsettling is DeLillo&#x27;s ability to integrate literary criticism into the narrative, commenting throughout on the nature and conventions of fiction itself without disturbing the flow of his story.&quot; The reviewer argued that the &quot;subtle juxtaposition of the author&#x27;s version of events with the Zapruder film&quot; causes the work to &quot;raise meaningful questions on the relationship between fiction and truth.&quot;

Robert Towers of &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; praised &quot;Libra&quot; as &quot;exceptionally interesting&quot; and stated that DeLillo &quot;imaginatively traces the lines of force converging to produce those echoing shots that &#x27;broke the back of the American century&#x27;.&quot;

Adam Begley of the &quot;London Review of Books&quot; deemed it the author&#x27;s best book up to that point, praising him for avoiding caricature in portrayals of disturbed individuals such as Ferrie and Ruby and &quot;[leaving] room for pity, if not for compassion.&quot; Begley also argued that DeLillo &quot;never seems overwhelmed or constrained by the facts of the case. Nor is he vexed by contradictions and omissions. &quot;Libra&quot; displays his genius for creative paranoia: he fills the gaps in the record with his imagination, spinning a brilliant web out of a heap of improbable coincidences.&quot;

A more moderately positive review appeared in &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot;, where the reviewer wrote that &quot;DeLillo mars the book a little with overly portentous intellectual meditations (by one of the CIA operatives) on the nature of plots--murderous or fictional--and by Jack Ruby&#x27;s hopelessly awkward Jewish-gangster manner of speaking. But these are flaw-specks in a book that is genuinely dread-filled--a story that everyone knows he doesn&#x27;t really know, and which DeLillo worries, and prods, and deepens with sure artistry.&quot;

Merle Rubin of &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; stated, &quot;DeLillo is deft enough at blending fact and fiction - at weaving many of the numberless known clues into a plausible narrative soaked in evocative atmosphere. Yet he cannot muster the Dostoyevskian depth and resonance that sometimes enable a writer to present a fiction more compelling than the real event that inspired it.&quot;

Norman Mailer was a great admirer of &quot;Libra&quot; and said that the book had inspired him to write &quot;Oswald&#x27;s Tale&quot;, his 1995 biography of Oswald.

In 2007, Oswald was described in &quot;New York&quot; as DeLillo&#x27;s greatest character. In a 2008 retrospective, Troy Jollimore argued, &quot;In his imaginative and sympathetic portrait of Oswald, of Jack Ruby, of Win Everett and Larry Parmenter and the other conspirators, DeLillo displays a deep understanding of how history really works, how much of it is accidental, unintended.&quot; In 2018, Jeffrey Somers wrote, &quot;The Kennedy assassination is an event DeLillo might have invented if it hadn&#x27;t actually happened. [...] Sometimes this one is overshadowed by other titles, but arguably it and &quot;White Noise&quot; are DeLillo&#x27;s masterworks.&quot;

==Awards and impact==
&quot;Libra&quot; was awarded the inaugural Irish Times International Fiction Prize, as well as a nomination for the 1988 National Book Award for Fiction. 

James Ellroy mentioned &quot;Libra&quot; as an inspiration for his novel &quot;American Tabloid&quot;, another take on the causes of the assassination.

<text>Somnath Chatterjee (25 July 1929 – 13 August 2018) was an Indian politician who was associated with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) for most of his life, though he had been a non affiliated independent during his last decade. He was the Speaker of the Lok Sabha (House of the People) from 2004 to 2009.

==Education and family background==
His father, Nirmal Chandra Chatterjee, was a prominent lawyer, intellectual, and Hindu revivalist and nationalist around the time of India&#x27;s independence, and his mother, Binapani Debi ran the home. Nirmal Chandra Chatterjee was one of the founders and one-time president of the Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha. In 1948, when the Communist Party of India was banned by the Jawaharlal Nehru led Indian National Congress government in India, and its party leaders arrested, Nirmal Chandra Chatterjee formed the All India Civil Liberties Union, and agitated for their release. In the process, he came close to Jyoti Basu, in spite of continuing ideological political differences between the two.

Somnath was educated at Mitra Institution School, Presidency College and then the University of Calcutta in Calcutta. He also attended Jesus College, Cambridge and graduating with a B.A. in 1952 and a M.A. in 1957, both in law, has been awarded an honorary fellowship by the college in 2007. He was called to the bar from the Middle Temple in London and took up legal practice as an advocate at the Calcutta High Court before entering active politics.

==Political career==

Somnath Chatterjee was a member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)) from 1968 to 2008. He became a Member of the Lok Sabha in 1971 when he was elected the first time as CPM (Marxist Communist) candidate from Burdwan (Lok Sabha constituency). Subsequently, he was re-elected nine times, except once when he lost to Mamata Banerjee in the Jadavpur Lok Sabha constituency in 1984. From 1989 until 2004 he was the leader of his party in the Lok Sabha. He was elected for the tenth time in 2004 as a member of the 14th Lok Sabha from Bolpur Lok Sabha constituency, which is considered to be a CPI(M) stronghold. Following the 2004 election, he was appointed the pro tem speaker and subsequently on 4 June 2004 he was unanimously elected as the Speaker of the 14th Lok Sabha.

===Expulsion from the CPI (M)===
After the CPI (M) withdrew its support for the UPA-led government in 2008, the party included Chatterjee&#x27;s name on its list of MPs who were withdrawing their support from the government, despite his non-partisan position as Speaker. Chatterjee, however, appeared unwilling to follow the party line to vote against the government in a crucial July 2008 confidence vote, as voting against the government would mean voting alongside the right-wing opposition BJP. Ignoring the party&#x27;s instructions, he decided to stay on in his post as Speaker of the House, acting in this capacity during the confidence vote. Following the vote, which the government survived, on 23 July 2008, the CPI (M) expelled him from the party for violation of party discipline. A CPI (M) press release said, &quot;The Politburo of the Communist Party of India-Marxist has unanimously decided to expel Somnath Chatterjee from the membership of the party with immediate effect. This action has been taken under Article XIX, clause 13 of the Party Constitution for seriously compromising the position of the party.&quot; Bengal secretary Biman Bose said &quot;Chatterjee may have acted according to the Indian Constitution but the party constitution is supreme in [the] case of party members.&quot;

According to Chatterjee, the expulsion was &quot;one of the saddest days&quot; of his life. He suggested that future speakers should resign from their parties while serving in that office to help ensure its non-partisan standing. His constituency of Bolpur had already been reserved for the Scheduled Castes, meaning he would have been unable to contest the seat in the next election; he announced in August 2008, following his expulsion from the CPI(M), that he would retire from politics at the time of the next election in 2009. He was broadly respected in his constituency; the CPI(M)&#x27;s 2009 candidate, Ramchandra Dom, expressed admiration for Chatterjee and vowed to continue his work, while the Congress candidate, Asit Mal, said that the people of Bolpur were &quot;hurt at the way [Chatterjee] was driven out of the CPI-M&quot; and that their feelings would &quot;be reflected in the results&quot;.

===Awards and honors===
In 1996 he won the Outstanding Parliamentarian Award.

in 2013, he received Living Legend Award at the prestigious Bharat Nirman Awards.

==Controversies==

In 2005, he was caught in a controversy over his statement on the Supreme Court orders related to the vote of confidence in the Jharkhand Assembly. He said that the Supreme Court was encroaching on the right of the Legislature by issuing orders on the proceedings of the Jharkhand Assembly. He asked for a Presidential reference to the Supreme Court under Article 143 of the Indian Constitution. This remark was criticised by Bharatiya Janata Party which supported the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision.

The Opposition demanded his resignation because he held an office of profit as Chairman of Santiniketan Sriniketan Development Authority (SSDA). He argued that since he did not profit from the office, the demand was baseless.

==Personal life==
Chatterjee married Renu Chatterjee, who comes from a zamindar family in Lalgola, on 7 February 1950. The couple have one son, Pratap and two daughters, Anuradha and Anushila. Pratap Chatterjee was practising at Calcutta High Court.

Somnath Chatterjee was known for his fiscal integrity. When in 2004, as speaker, he moved into the official residence at 20 Akbar Road, he discontinued the practice of paying for toiletries and tea from the national exchequer. On trips abroad, he bore the expenses of any accompanying family members.

===Death===
Chatterjee died at a private hospital in Kolkata on 13 August 2018 morning. An asthmatic and a diabetic, he was keeping indifferent health since the past three years. He was hospitalised on a few occasions hence. The expulsion from CPI (M) in 2008 and his daughter Anuradha&#x27;s death in late 2017 nearly shattered the once asserting Speaker, Lok Sabha. He had suffered a stroke in June, and his condition had deteriorated in the following weeks. His family asked the Communist party leaders to leave his funeral and refused to allow his body to be draped by the party flag.

<doc id="665204" wikidata="Q2003535" url="?curid=665204" title="Join (SQL)">
<text>A join clause in the Structured Query Language (SQL) combines columns from one or more tables into a new table. The operation corresponds to a join operation in relational algebra. Informally, a join stitches two tables and puts on the same row records with matching fields : codice_1, codice_2, codice_3, codice_4 and codice_5.

==Example tables==
To explain join types, the rest of this article uses the following tables:


codice_6 is the primary key of the codice_7 table, whereas codice_8 is a foreign key.

Note that in codice_9, &quot;Williams&quot; has not yet been assigned to a department. Also, no employees have been assigned to the &quot;Marketing&quot; department.

These are the SQL statements to create the above tables:
CREATE TABLE department(
 DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
 DepartmentName VARCHAR(20)

CREATE TABLE employee (
 LastName VARCHAR(20),
 DepartmentID INT REFERENCES department(DepartmentID)

INSERT INTO department
VALUES (31, &#x27;Sales&#x27;),
 (33, &#x27;Engineering&#x27;),
 (34, &#x27;Clerical&#x27;),
 (35, &#x27;Marketing&#x27;);

INSERT INTO employee
VALUES (&#x27;Rafferty&#x27;, 31),
 (&#x27;Jones&#x27;, 33),
 (&#x27;Heisenberg&#x27;, 33),
 (&#x27;Robinson&#x27;, 34),
 (&#x27;Smith&#x27;, 34),
 (&#x27;Williams&#x27;, NULL);
==Cross join==
codice_10 returns the Cartesian product of rows from tables in the join. In other words, it will produce rows which combine each row from the first table with each row from the second table.

Example of an explicit cross join:
SELECT *
FROM employee CROSS JOIN department;
Example of an implicit cross join:

SELECT *
FROM employee, department;
The cross join can be replaced with an inner join with an always-true condition:
SELECT *
FROM employee INNER JOIN department ON 1=1;
codice_10 does not itself apply any predicate to filter rows from the joined table. The results of a codice_10 can be filtered using a codice_13 clause, which may then produce the equivalent of an inner join.

In the standard, cross joins are part of the optional F401, &quot;Extended joined table&quot;, package.

Normal uses are for checking the server&#x27;s performance.

==Inner join==

An inner join (or join) requires each row in the two joined tables to have matching column values, and is a commonly used join operation in applications but should not be assumed to be the best choice in all situations. Inner join creates a new result table by combining column values of two tables (A and B) based upon the join-predicate. The query compares each row of A with each row of B to find all pairs of rows that satisfy the join-predicate. When the join-predicate is satisfied by matching non-NULL values, column values for each matched pair of rows of A and B are combined into a result row.

The result of the join can be defined as the outcome of first taking the cartesian product (or cross join) of all rows in the tables (combining every row in table A with every row in table B) and then returning all rows that satisfy the join predicate. Actual SQL implementations normally use other approaches, such as hash joins or sort-merge joins, since computing the Cartesian product is slower and would often require a prohibitively large amount of memory to store.

SQL specifies two different syntactical ways to express joins: the &quot;explicit join notation&quot; and the &quot;implicit join notation&quot;. The &quot;implicit join notation&quot; is no longer considered a best practice, although database systems still support it.

The &quot;explicit join notation&quot; uses the codice_14 keyword, optionally preceded by the codice_1 keyword, to specify the table to join, and the codice_16 keyword to specify the predicates for the join, as in the following example:
SELECT employee.LastName, employee.DepartmentID, department.DepartmentName 
FROM employee 
INNER JOIN department ON
employee.DepartmentID = department.DepartmentID;


The &quot;implicit join notation&quot; simply lists the tables for joining, in the codice_17 clause of the codice_18 statement, using commas to separate them. Thus it specifies a cross join, and the codice_13 clause may apply additional filter-predicates (which function comparably to the join-predicates in the explicit notation).

The following example is equivalent to the previous one, but this time using implicit join notation:
SELECT employee.LastName, employee.DepartmentID, department.DepartmentName 
FROM employee, department
WHERE employee.DepartmentID = department.DepartmentID;
The queries given in the examples above will join the Employee and department tables using the DepartmentID column of both tables. Where the DepartmentID of these tables match (i.e. the join-predicate is satisfied), the query will combine the &quot;LastName&quot;, &quot;DepartmentID&quot; and &quot;DepartmentName&quot; columns from the two tables into a result row. Where the DepartmentID does not match, no result row is generated.

Thus the result of the execution of the query above will be:

The employee &quot;Williams&quot; and the department &quot;Marketing&quot; do not appear in the query execution results. Neither of these has any matching rows in the other respective table: &quot;Williams&quot; has no associated department, and no employee has the department ID 35 (&quot;Marketing&quot;). Depending on the desired results, this behavior may be a subtle bug, which can be avoided by replacing the inner join with an outer join.

=== Inner join and NULL values ===
Programmers should take special care when joining tables on columns that can contain NULL values, since NULL will never match any other value (not even NULL itself), unless the join condition explicitly uses a combination predicate that first checks that the joins columns are codice_20 before applying the remaining predicate condition(s). The Inner Join can only be safely used in a database that enforces referential integrity or where the join columns are guaranteed not to be NULL. Many transaction processing relational databases rely on atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability (ACID) data update standards to ensure data integrity, making inner joins an appropriate choice. However, transaction databases usually also have desirable join columns that are allowed to be NULL. Many reporting relational database and data warehouses use high volume extract, transform, load (ETL) batch updates which make referential integrity difficult or impossible to enforce, resulting in potentially NULL join columns that an SQL query author cannot modify and which cause inner joins to omit data with no indication of an error. The choice to use an inner join depends on the database design and data characteristics. A left outer join can usually be substituted for an inner join when the join columns in one table may contain NULL values.

Any data column that may be NULL (empty) should never be used as a link in an inner join, unless the intended result is to eliminate the rows with the NULL value. If NULL join columns are to be deliberately removed from the result set, an inner join can be faster than an outer join because the table join and filtering is done in a single step. Conversely, an inner join can result in disastrously slow performance or even a server crash when used in a large volume query in combination with database functions in an SQL Where clause. A function in an SQL Where clause can result in the database ignoring relatively compact table indexes. The database may read and inner join the selected columns from both tables before reducing the number of rows using the filter that depends on a calculated value, resulting in a relatively enormous amount of inefficient processing.

When a result set is produced by joining several tables, including master tables used to look up full-text descriptions of numeric identifier codes (a Lookup table), a NULL value in any one of the foreign keys can result in the entire row being eliminated from the result set, with no indication of error. A complex SQL query that includes one or more inner joins and several outer joins has the same risk for NULL values in the inner join link columns.

A commitment to SQL code containing inner joins assumes NULL join columns will not be introduced by future changes, including vendor updates, design changes and bulk processing outside of the application&#x27;s data validation rules such as data conversions, migrations, bulk imports and merges.

One can further classify inner joins as equi-joins, as natural joins, or as cross-joins.

===Equi-join===
An equi-join is a specific type of comparator-based join, that uses only equality comparisons in the join-predicate. Using other comparison operators (such as codice_21) disqualifies a join as an equi-join. The query shown above has already provided an example of an equi-join:

SELECT *
FROM employee JOIN department
 ON employee.DepartmentID = department.DepartmentID;
We can write equi-join as below,
SELECT *
FROM employee, department
WHERE employee.DepartmentID = department.DepartmentID;
If columns in an equi-join have the same name, SQL-92 provides an optional shorthand notation for expressing equi-joins, by way of the codice_22 construct:

SELECT *
FROM employee INNER JOIN department USING (DepartmentID);
The codice_22 construct is more than mere syntactic sugar, however, since the result set differs from the result set of the version with the explicit predicate. Specifically, any columns mentioned in the codice_22 list will appear only once, with an unqualified name, rather than once for each table in the join. In the case above, there will be a single codice_25 column and no codice_26 or codice_27.

The codice_22 clause is not supported by MS SQL Server and Sybase.

====Natural join====
The natural join is a special case of equi-join. Natural join (⋈) is a binary operator that is written as (&quot;R&quot; ⋈ &quot;S&quot;) where &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; are relations. The result of the natural join is the set of all combinations of tuples in &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; that are equal on their common attribute names. For an example consider the tables &quot;Employee&quot; and &quot;Dept&quot; and their natural join:

This can also be used to define composition of relations. For example, the composition of &quot;Employee&quot; and &quot;Dept&quot; is their join as shown above, projected on all but the common attribute &quot;DeptName&quot;. In category theory, the join is precisely the fiber product.

The natural join is arguably one of the most important operators since it is the relational counterpart of logical AND. Note that if the same variable appears in each of two predicates that are connected by AND, then that variable stands for the same thing and both appearances must always be substituted by the same value. In particular, the natural join allows the combination of relations that are associated by a foreign key. For example, in the above example a foreign key probably holds from &quot;Employee&quot;.&quot;DeptName&quot; to &quot;Dept&quot;.&quot;DeptName&quot; and then the natural join of &quot;Employee&quot; and &quot;Dept&quot; combines all employees with their departments. This works because the foreign key holds between attributes with the same name. If this is not the case such as in the foreign key from &quot;Dept&quot;.&quot;manager&quot; to &quot;Employee&quot;.&quot;Name&quot; then these columns have to be renamed before the natural join is taken. Such a join is sometimes also referred to as an equi-join.

More formally the semantics of the natural join are defined as follows:

:formula_1,

where &quot;Fun&quot; is a predicate that is true for a relation &quot;r&quot; if and only if &quot;r&quot; is a function. It is usually required that &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; must have at least one common attribute, but if this constraint is omitted, and &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; have no common attributes, then the natural join becomes exactly the Cartesian product.

The natural join can be simulated with Codd&#x27;s primitives as follows. Let &quot;c&quot;1, ..., &quot;c&quot;&quot;m&quot; be the attribute names common to &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot;, &quot;r&quot;1, ..., &quot;r&quot;&quot;n&quot; be the attribute names unique to &quot;R&quot; and let &quot;s&quot;1, ..., &quot;s&quot;&quot;k&quot; be the attributes unique to &quot;S&quot;. Furthermore, assume that the attribute names &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;m&quot; are neither in &quot;R&quot; nor in &quot;S&quot;. In a first step the common attribute names in &quot;S&quot; can now be renamed:

:formula_2

Then we take the Cartesian product and select the tuples that are to be joined:

:formula_3

A natural join is a type of equi-join where the join predicate arises implicitly by comparing all columns in both tables that have the same column-names in the joined tables. The resulting joined table contains only one column for each pair of equally named columns. In the case that no columns with the same names are found, the result is a cross join.

Most experts agree that NATURAL JOINs are dangerous and therefore strongly discourage their use. The danger comes from inadvertently adding a new column, named the same as another column in the other table. An existing natural join might then &quot;naturally&quot; use the new column for comparisons, making comparisons/matches using different criteria (from different columns) than before. Thus an existing query could produce different results, even though the data in the tables have not been changed, but only augmented. The use of column names to automatically determine table links is not an option in large databases with hundreds or thousands of tables where it would place an unrealistic constraint on naming conventions. Real world databases are commonly designed with foreign key data that is not consistently populated (NULL values are allowed), due to business rules and context. It is common practice to modify column names of similar data in different tables and this lack of rigid consistency relegates natural joins to a theoretical concept for discussion.

The above sample query for inner joins can be expressed as a natural join in the following way:

SELECT *
FROM employee NATURAL JOIN department;
As with the explicit codice_22 clause, only one DepartmentID column occurs in the joined table, with no qualifier:

PostgreSQL, MySQL and Oracle support natural joins; Microsoft T-SQL and IBM DB2 do not. The columns used in the join are implicit so the join code does not show which columns are expected, and a change in column names may change the results. In the standard, natural joins are part of the optional F401, &quot;Extended joined table&quot;, package.

In many database environments the column names are controlled by an outside vendor, not the query developer. A natural join assumes stability and consistency in column names which can change during vendor mandated version upgrades.

==Outer join==
The joined table retains each row—even if no other matching row exists. Outer joins subdivide further into left outer joins, right outer joins, and full outer joins, depending on which table&#x27;s rows are retained: left, right, or both (in this case &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; refer to the two sides of the codice_14 keyword). Like inner joins, one can further sub-categorize all types of outer joins as equi-joins, natural joins, codice_31 (&quot;θ&quot;-join), etc.

No implicit join-notation for outer joins exists in standard SQL.
===Left outer join===
The result of a left outer join (or simply left join) for tables A and B always contains all rows of the &quot;left&quot; table (A), even if the join-condition does not find any matching row in the &quot;right&quot; table (B). This means that if the codice_16 clause matches 0 (zero) rows in B (for a given row in A), the join will still return a row in the result (for that row)—but with NULL in each column from B. A left outer join returns all the values from an inner join plus all values in the left table that do not match to the right table, including rows with NULL (empty) values in the link column.

For example, this allows us to find an employee&#x27;s department, but still shows employees that have not been assigned to a department (contrary to the inner-join example above, where unassigned employees were excluded from the result).

Example of a left outer join (the codice_33 keyword is optional), with the additional result row (compared with the inner join) italicized:
SELECT *
FROM employee 
LEFT OUTER JOIN department ON employee.DepartmentID = department.DepartmentID;


====Alternative syntaxes====
Oracle supports the deprecated syntax:

SELECT *
FROM employee, department
WHERE employee.DepartmentID = department.DepartmentID(+)

Sybase supports the syntax (Microsoft SQL Server deprecated this syntax since version 2000):

SELECT *
FROM employee, department
WHERE employee.DepartmentID *= department.DepartmentID

IBM Informix supports the syntax:

SELECT *
FROM employee, OUTER department
WHERE employee.DepartmentID = department.DepartmentID

===Right outer join===
A right outer join (or right join) closely resembles a left outer join, except with the treatment of the tables reversed. Every row from the &quot;right&quot; table (B) will appear in the joined table at least once. If no matching row from the &quot;left&quot; table (A) exists, NULL will appear in columns from A for those rows that have no match in B.

A right outer join returns all the values from the right table and matched values from the left table (NULL in the case of no matching join predicate). For example, this allows us to find each employee and his or her department, but still show departments that have no employees.

Below is an example of a right outer join (the codice_33 keyword is optional), with the additional result row italicized:
SELECT *
FROM employee RIGHT OUTER JOIN department
 ON employee.DepartmentID = department.DepartmentID;


Right and left outer joins are functionally equivalent. Neither provides any functionality that the other does not, so right and left outer joins may replace each other as long as the table order is switched.
===Full outer join===
Conceptually, a full outer join combines the effect of applying both left and right outer joins. Where rows in the full outer joined tables do not match, the result set will have NULL values for every column of the table that lacks a matching row. For those rows that do match, a single row will be produced in the result set (containing columns populated from both tables).

For example, this allows us to see each employee who is in a department and each department that has an employee, but also see each employee who is not part of a department and each department which doesn&#x27;t have an employee.

Example of a full outer join (the codice_33 keyword is optional):
SELECT *
FROM employee FULL OUTER JOIN department
 ON employee.DepartmentID = department.DepartmentID;


Some database systems do not support the full outer join functionality directly, but they can emulate it through the use of an inner join and UNION ALL selects of the &quot;single table rows&quot; from left and right tables respectively. The same example can appear as follows:

SELECT employee.LastName, employee.DepartmentID,
 department.DepartmentName, department.DepartmentID
FROM employee
INNER JOIN department ON employee.DepartmentID = department.DepartmentID

UNION ALL

SELECT employee.LastName, employee.DepartmentID,
 cast(NULL as varchar(20)), cast(NULL as integer)
FROM employee
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
 SELECT * FROM department
 WHERE employee.DepartmentID = department.DepartmentID)

UNION ALL

SELECT cast(NULL as varchar(20)), cast(NULL as integer),
 department.DepartmentName, department.DepartmentID
FROM department
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
 SELECT * FROM employee
 WHERE employee.DepartmentID = department.DepartmentID)
Another approach could be UNION ALL of left outer join and right outer join MINUS inner join.

==Self-join==
A self-join is joining a table to itself.

===Example===
If there were two separate tables for employees and a query which requested employees in the first table having the same country as employees in the second table, a normal join operation could be used to find the answer table. However, all the employee information is contained within a single large table.

Consider a modified codice_9 table such as the following:

An example solution query could be as follows:
SELECT F.EmployeeID, F.LastName, S.EmployeeID, S.LastName, F.Country
FROM Employee F INNER JOIN Employee S ON F.Country = S.Country
WHERE F.EmployeeID &lt; S.EmployeeID
ORDER BY F.EmployeeID, S.EmployeeID;
Which results in the following table being generated.
For this example:
* codice_37 and codice_38 are aliases for the first and second copies of the employee table.
* The condition codice_39 excludes pairings between employees in different countries. The example question only wanted pairs of employees in the same country.
* The condition codice_40 excludes pairings where the codice_41 of the first employee is greater than or equal to the codice_41 of the second employee. In other words, the effect of this condition is to exclude duplicate pairings and self-pairings. Without it, the following less useful table would be generated (the table below displays only the &quot;Germany&quot; portion of the result):
Only one of the two middle pairings is needed to satisfy the original question, and the topmost and bottommost are of no interest at all in this example.

==Alternatives==
The effect of an outer join can also be obtained using a UNION ALL between an INNER JOIN and a SELECT of the rows in the &quot;main&quot; table that do not fulfill the join condition. For example,
SELECT employee.LastName, employee.DepartmentID, department.DepartmentName
FROM employee
LEFT OUTER JOIN department ON employee.DepartmentID = department.DepartmentID;
can also be written as
SELECT employee.LastName, employee.DepartmentID, department.DepartmentName
FROM employee
INNER JOIN department ON employee.DepartmentID = department.DepartmentID

UNION ALL

SELECT employee.LastName, employee.DepartmentID, cast(NULL as varchar(20))
FROM employee
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
 SELECT * FROM department
 WHERE employee.DepartmentID = department.DepartmentID)
==Implementation==

Much work in database-systems has aimed at efficient implementation of joins, because relational systems commonly call for joins, yet face difficulties in optimising their efficient execution. The problem arises because inner joins operate both commutatively and associatively. In practice, this means that the user merely supplies the list of tables for joining and the join conditions to use, and the database system has the task of determining the most efficient way to perform the operation. The choices become more complex as the number of tables involved in a query increases, with each table having different characteristics in record count, average record length (considering NULL fields) and available indexes. Where Clause filters can also significantly impact query volume and cost.

A query optimizer determines how to execute a query containing joins. A query optimizer has two basic freedoms:

# Join order: Because it joins functions commutatively and associatively, the order in which the system joins tables does not change the final result set of the query. However, join-order could have an enormous impact on the cost of the join operation, so choosing the best join order becomes very important.
# Join method: Given two tables and a join condition, multiple algorithms can produce the result set of the join. Which algorithm runs most efficiently depends on the sizes of the input tables, the number of rows from each table that match the join condition, and the operations required by the rest of the query.

Many join-algorithms treat their inputs differently. One can refer to the inputs to a join as the &quot;outer&quot; and &quot;inner&quot; join operands, or &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot;, respectively. In the case of nested loops, for example, the database system will scan the entire inner relation for each row of the outer relation.

One can classify query-plans involving joins as follows:

; left-deep : using a base table (rather than another join) as the inner operand of each join in the plan
; right-deep : using a base table as the outer operand of each join in the plan
; bushy : neither left-deep nor right-deep; both inputs to a join may themselves result from joins

These names derive from the appearance of the query plan if drawn as a tree, with the outer join relation on the left and the inner relation on the right (as convention dictates).

===Join algorithms===

Three fundamental algorithms for performing a binary join operation exist: nested loop join, sort-merge join and hash join. Worst-case optimal join algorithms are asymptotically faster than binary join algorithms for joins between more than two relations in the worst case.

===Join indexes===
Join indexes are database indexes that facilitate the processing of join queries in data warehouses: they are currently (2012) available in implementations by Oracle and Teradata.

In the Teradata implementation, specified columns, aggregate functions on columns, or components of date columns from one or more tables are specified using a syntax similar to the definition of a database view: up to 64 columns/column expressions can be specified in a single join index. Optionally, a column that defines the primary key of the composite data may also be specified: on parallel hardware, the column values are used to partition the index&#x27;s contents across multiple disks. When the source tables are updated interactively by users, the contents of the join index are automatically updated. Any query whose WHERE clause specifies any combination of columns or column expressions that are an exact subset of those defined in a join index (a so-called &quot;covering query&quot;) will cause the join index, rather than the original tables and their indexes, to be consulted during query execution.

The Oracle implementation limits itself to using bitmap indexes. A &quot;bitmap join index&quot; is used for low-cardinality columns (i.e., columns containing fewer than 300 distinct values, according to the Oracle documentation): it combines low-cardinality columns from multiple related tables. The example Oracle uses is that of an inventory system, where different suppliers provide different parts. The schema has three linked tables: two &quot;master tables&quot;, Part and Supplier, and a &quot;detail table&quot;, Inventory. The last is a many-to-many table linking Supplier to Part, and contains the most rows. Every part has a Part Type, and every supplier is based in the US, and has a State column. There are not more than 60 states+territories in the US, and not more than 300 Part Types. The bitmap join index is defined using a standard three-table join on the three tables above, and specifying the Part_Type and Supplier_State columns for the index. However, it is defined on the Inventory table, even though the columns Part_Type and Supplier_State are &quot;borrowed&quot; from Supplier and Part respectively.

As for Teradata, an Oracle bitmap join index is only utilized to answer a query when the query&#x27;s WHERE clause specifies columns limited to those that are included in the join index.

=== Straight join ===
Some database systems allow the user to force the system to read the tables in a join in a particular order. This is used when the join optimizer chooses to read the tables in an inefficient order. For example, in MySQL the command codice_43 reads the tables in exactly the order listed in the query.

<doc id="665207" wikidata="Q296797" url="?curid=665207" title="David T. C. Davies">
<text>David Thomas Charles Davies (born 27 July 1970) is a British politician who was Secretary of State for Wales from 2022 to 2024. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Monmouth from 2005 to 2024. A member of the Conservative Party, he chaired the Welsh Affairs Select Committee from 2010 to 2019. Davies also served as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales from 2019 to 2022, and as Member of the Welsh Assembly (AM) for Monmouth from 1999 to 2007.

A vocal critic of the European Union, he supported Brexit in the 2016 membership referendum. Having previously questioned the scientific evidence for the role of human factors in global warming, Davies said in 2019 that he supported the UK government&#x27;s intention to become carbon neutral by 2050 and that he fully accepted the link between carbon dioxide and climate change.

==Background==
Davies was born on 27 July 1970 in Newham, London, to Peter and Kathleen Davies (). A great-grandfather was German and Jewish. He was educated at Clytha School and Bassaleg School in Newport, Wales. After leaving school in 1988 he worked for the British Steel Corporation and served with the Territorial Army. He worked for his family in their shipping company, Burrow Heath Ltd, before entering politics. 

He married Aliz Harnisföger, who is Hungarian, in October 2003 in Monmouth, and they have three children. A keen sportsman, Davies has fought in several charity boxing matches as &quot;The Tory Tornado&quot; and is a former president of the Welsh Amateur Boxing Association.

Davies speaks Welsh, after learning the language as a beginner when he was elected to the National Assembly for Wales. He was awarded the accolade of Welsh Speaker of the Year and was the first AM to address the Welsh Language Society, Cymdeithas Yr Iaith Gymraeg, in Welsh.

===Service as a Special Constable===
Davies was sworn in as a Special Constable with the British Transport Police in March 2007. On his third patrol he searched a man &#x27;acting suspiciously&#x27; and found a handgun. In August 2011, Davies wrote about his experiences on riot duty and lamented that police were ordered not to go out alone in uniform for safety reasons. Davies had to return from a short holiday for the recall of Parliament to discuss the riots across England and also served on patrols in London that week in his role as a special constable. He called for the police to be encouraged to take tougher action during the riots. He resigned in 2015, after serving nine years as a special constable, because of rules about police officers taking part in politics.

== Political career ==
=== Pre-Assembly Career ===
He unsuccessfully contested the seat of Bridgend at the 1997 general election, finishing in second place 15,248 votes behind Win Griffiths.

==== Just Say No Campaign ====
As an opponent of the concept of a new Welsh assembly, Davies helped to set up the &#x27;No&#x27; campaign in the devolution referendum, and being frequently quoted as a spokesperson or &#x27;prominent member&#x27; for the campaign throughout the devolution campaign and referendum.

=== Welsh Assembly ===

==== First Assembly ====
Davies gained a higher profile and decided to run as the Conservative candidate for Monmouth. At the inaugural 1999 Welsh Assembly Election he was elected to the National Assembly for Wales. He was the only Conservative member to win on a constituency ballot. He became the deputy leader of the Welsh Conservatives and Chief Whip under Rod Richards. 

In August 1999, Rod Richards stood down as leader of the Conservative Group in the Assembly to contest charges of grievous bodily harm made against him. He insisted that this would be temporary, and that .Davies, as his deputy, would stand in until the matter was resolved. Davies stood in the role for a total of 5 days, between 5 and 10 August, before the Assembly Conservative group elected to appoint Nick Bourne as the group&#x27;s temporary leader, over Davies. Later that month, Bourne would reshuffle the Welsh Conservative&#x27;s frontbench roles. Davies retained his role as Chief Whip in this reshuffle, as well as being handed the portfolio for Environment, Transport and Planning. 

In 2000, Davies was investigated by the Independent Adviser on Standards of Conduct for misusing Assembly stationary to invite people to see a display he had put together in the Assembly to oppose to repeal of Section 28. The case was dismissed shortly after.

In November 2000, Davies&#x27; retained his responsibilities for Environment and Transport, but lost his responsibilities for local government and planning, with these going to colleague William Graham.

In August 2001, Davies made a statement clarifying that Edgar Griffin, father of British National Party founder Nick Griffin was no longer a member of the Conservative Party&#x27;s welsh campaign team, which Davies had helped to recruit.

Davies supported Iain Duncan Smith in the 2001 Conservative Party leadership election.

In November 2001, Davies was reshuffled away from the role of Chief Whip for the Welsh Conservatives, instead being placed on the Welsh Assembly&#x27;s economic development committee.

Davies was consistently critical of attempts to grant more powers to the Welsh Assembly, publishing a leaflet in 2002 which stated &quot;Only one in four people voted for devolution in the referendum, so it would be grossly unfair to turn the Assembly into a Parliament by stealth. I believe no further powers should be given to the Welsh Assembly without a further referendum, and that referendum should also include a question, &#x27;Should we get rid of the Assembly altogether&#x27;?&quot; He did so after fellow Conservative AM David Melding asked First Minister Rhodri Morgan if he believed the assembly should be granted primary legislative powers.

==== Second Assembly ====
Davies was re-elected at the 2003 National Assembly election, and was again the only member of the Welsh Conservatives elected on a constituency ballot, and received the largest vote of any candidate in Wales. He was appointed as the Welsh Conservative Education spokesperson by Nicke Bourne shortly after. He was also handed the role as Conservative Equal Opportunities spokesperson, and placed on the Assembly&#x27;s Equal Opportunities Committee.

Shortly after, Davies spotted attempted to hold a Wales-specific referendum on the EU Constitutional Treaty, using Section 36 of the Government of Wales Act 1998, which said &quot;The Assembly may hold a poll in Wales or any part or parts of Wales for the purpose of ascertaining the views of those polled about whether or how any of the Assembly&#x27;s functions should be exercised.&quot; First Minister Rhodri Morgan described the attempt as &quot;[running] contrary to all British precedent&quot; while Wales Secretary Peter Hain described it as &quot;outrageous hypocrisy&quot; - stating that Conservative governments had not held referendums on any European treaties.

In September 2003, it was announced that Davies had been selected to run as the Conservative candidate for Monmouth at the 2005 General Election. At the time he stated he had no intention to stand down as Assembly member for the constituency.

In February 2004, Davies described the Commission for Racial Equality as &quot;one of the best recruiting sergeants the BNP could ever have&quot; on television. He further described the CRE&#x27;s as having &quot;coined the phrase institutional racism&quot; &quot;because they could not actually pin down any particular examples of racist behaviour.&quot; He further described the commission itself as institutionally racist. The CRE&#x27;s Wales Commissioner Cherry Short described Davies as &#x27;&quot;living in cloud cuckoo land&quot; if he believed their work assisted racists.

In April 2004, Davies was removed as Welsh Conservative Equal Opportunities Spokesperson, after he walked out of, and subsequently resigned from, the Assembly&#x27;s Equal Opportunities Committee. He had reportedly asked a representative of Stonewall &quot;I wonder why you feel a homosexual who is attacked has more rights in the eyes of the law than an elderly lady or an elderly man?&quot;, among other questions, after the charity had presented its annual report to the committee. Stonewall representative Derek Walker responded by saying &quot;We don&#x27;t think any crime against an older person should be treated in a lesser way. Our survey shows it is a big issue in Wales and across the country. We have asked it to be prioritised in the same way racial crime is.&quot; Social Justice Minister Edwina Hart had described his remarks as &quot;offensive&quot;, at which point Davies reportedly left, describing the committee as &quot;a total waste of time&quot; and said &quot;I simply can&#x27;t go on&quot;. He was replaced as Equal Opportunities Spokesperson by Mark Isherwood.

=== Election to the UK Parliament and Dual Mandate ===
He was elected at the 2005 general election as member of the House of Commons for Monmouth, the seat he held in the Welsh Assembly. He defeated the sitting Labour MP Huw Edwards by 4,527 votes, and remained the MP for the constituency until the July 2024 election. On 18 May 2005 he made his maiden speech giving a history of his constituency from Geoffrey of Monmouth onwards. After his election to the UK parliament, his role as Welsh Conservative Spokesperson on Education in the Assembly was re-assigned to William Graham. He had previously announced his intention to stand down as Assembly Member for Monmouth at the 2007 Welsh Assembly election. The Conservatives retained the Monmouth seat, at that election with Nick Ramsay being elected.

=== UK Parliamentary career ===
Once elected to Parliament he joined the Welsh Affairs Select Committee on his election. After the 2015 general election, he was returned unopposed the chairmanship of the committee.

In 2008, Davies criticised the National Black Police Association&#x27;s race-based membership policy for not allowing white people interested in fighting racism to become full members and suggesting that they themselves could be guilty of racism.

In 2013 Davies voted against the Cameron–Clegg coalition government on the issue of British military intervention in the Syrian civil war.

During the trial of fellow Welsh MP Nigel Evans, Davies gave evidence of his character, stating that Evans liked a drink and became jovial when intoxicated, unlike some people who have a dark side. Evans was Davies&#x27; best man at his 2003 wedding. In May 2013, Davies said of Evans: &quot;He&#x27;s been a good friend of mine for a lot of years. I am stunned by these allegations and find them impossible to believe.&quot; Evans was acquitted of sexual assaults in April 2014. 

In June 2015, Davies strongly criticised the planning and organisation of the first Velothon Wales event to be run in Wales which passed through his Monmouth constituency, arguing that business losses should be compensated for.

In July 2024, Davies contested the Monmouthshire constituency. He lost, with Labour&#x27;s Catherine Fookes winning by 3,338 votes.

==== Expenses ====
In 2009 &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Davies had claimed £2,000 of taxpayers&#x27; money and paid it to his family&#x27;s haulage firm. Davies defended his actions in an interview, denying any wrongdoing and explaining to BBC Wales that his family&#x27;s firm had been paid to provide postage and produce publicity material at short notice for the annual Monmouth show, that they had not profited, and that he had subsequently used a specialist company in London for the production of such material where the costs were significantly higher. 

In May of the same year, Davies became the first member of the Commons to voluntarily make his expense claims public. They were scrutinised by an independent panel which he had assembled and it emerged that Davies had claimed £475 for furniture for his London apartment, in addition to the monies paid to his family firm.

==== Welsh Affairs Committee ====
In June 2010 Davies was appointed Chairman of the Welsh Affairs Committee. He is a former member of the Home Affairs Select Committee and is an advocate of tough measures to deal with criminality. Davies is also Vice-Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary China Group and a member of the All-Party Parliamentary British-German Group. In January 2012, the Prime Minister David Cameron announced his appointment as a representative of the UK delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.

==== July 2022 United Kingdom government crisis ====

On 7 July 2022, following the resignation of Secretary of State for Wales Simon Hart, Davies confirmed that he &quot;will not take the role&quot;.

===Secretary of State for Wales===
On 25 October 2022, upon Rishi Sunak&#x27;s appointment as Prime Minister, Davies was appointed Secretary of State for Wales, succeeding Robert Buckland.

In April 2023 the Welsh Government wrote to Davies, asking for his consent for legal aid and £1,600 monthly payments to be given to some asylum seekers under their Basic Income pilot. Davies, describing the request as &quot;highly irresponsible&quot; and &quot;indefensible&quot;, and arguing the move would &quot;incentivise human traffickers&quot;, declined to approve it.

In late 2023, TATA Steel announced plans to close its operations in South Wales, which would have led to thousands of job losses and the end of primary steel making. The UK Government&#x27;s Department for Business and Trade and the Wales Office were able to negotiate a £500 million support package to keep TATA Steel&#x27;s operations open, but which would lead to the closure of two blast furnaces and the opening of an electric arc furnace. In an interview, Davies said without the government&#x27;s offer TATA would have closed – but their operations have now been &quot;saved&quot;.

In May 2024, Davies was accused by his counterpart - Jo Stevens - of breaking the ministerial code for filming a video in the Wales Office, where he said: &quot;Do they [Welsh Labour] want to spend £120m on Welsh taxpayers&#x27; money on creating dozens of extra Senedd members in Cardiff Bay? Or would they prefer to spend that money on employing more nurses, doctors, dentists and teachers? I know which side I&#x27;m on.&quot; The Welsh government has defended the plans, saying they are needed to better scrutinise their work which has grown significantly since the National Assembly was established in 1999.

=== Post-Parliament ===
In August 2024 it was reported that Davies was seeking work as an advisor to Conservative Member of the Senedd Laura Anne Jones. On 2 September 2024 it was confirmed that he had begun working for Jones. He wrote on LinkedIn to say that &quot;the chance to return to the Senedd after 17 years was far too tempting to pass up&quot;. In January 2025, Davies was appointed by Darren Millar as the new Welsh Conservatives Chief of Staff.
==Political views==
===Brexit===
Davies campaigned for Brexit. In May 2019, while attempting a television interview on College Green, Davies was confronted by a pro-Brexit activist, clearly unaware of his identity, who accused him of being a &#x27;remoaner&#x27;, a &#x27;liar&#x27;, a &#x27;snowflake&#x27; and not a Brexiteer. Davies said that he had voted to leave in the referendum and had voted for Theresa May&#x27;s failed Brexit withdrawal agreement. The two argued as Davies accused her of having &quot;a big mouth and &quot;access to a keyboard&quot; and attempted to record the incident on the body camera that was strapped around his torso while she simultaneously filmed him.

In October 2019, commenting on his interventions following the Speaker&#x27;s refusal to permit a debate on the Government&#x27;s Brexit agreement, &quot;The Guardian&#x27;s&quot; political sketchwriter John Crace described Davies as &quot;one of the dimmest people in parliament – even the sheep in his Welsh constituency have a higher IQ&quot;.

In December 2020, when it was announced that the EU and UK had reached a post-Brexit free trade agreement, Davies said: &quot;This is a historic day, because we have shown now we can get control over our laws, our borders, over our money, and at the same time get access to the single market.&quot;

===Asylum===
In May 2010, Davies was described by a rival Labour candidate, Hamish Sandison, as being on the &quot;far right of the Conservative Party&quot;, which Davies described as an attempt to smear him as &quot;some sort of Nazi&quot; for raising concerns over immigration. A critic of the Coalition, Davies wrote a letter in 2012 to his constituents apologising for &quot;incompetence at the highest levels of government&quot; and accusing David Cameron of failing to listen to the concerns of backbenchers and the people who elected them. Earlier, in January of the same year, Davies referred to some communities as having imported &quot;barbaric views on women&quot;. Commenting on a rape case, Davies said that upbringing could be a major factor although he saw it as &quot;not an Islamic issue... let me be quite clear, and it&#x27;s not a racial issue&quot;.

In May 2012, during a phone-in on the Jeremy Vine show on BBC Radio 2, Davies told a member of the public that she should join the BNP after she advocated the compulsory teaching of the Welsh language in schools. On his web page, he states his opinion &#x27;that people who come to this country should learn English and be expected to work and to fit in with our rules, culture and traditions&#x27;.

Davies was criticised in 2015 for using the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack to promote the Conservative Party election pledge to abolish the Human Rights Act 1998. Davies said that &quot;under current laws, including the Human Rights Act, anyone can come to the UK and make a claim for asylum&quot;, which was rebutted in &quot;The Guardian&quot; and in an article by Dr Mark Elliot at the University of Cambridge.

In response to the 2015 refugee crisis Davies said that most of the people attempting to enter the UK via Calais were not refugees fleeing war, but were economic migrants &quot;mostly young men, mostly with mobile phones, chancing their luck&quot;. Davies attracted media attention in October 2016 with a tweet suggesting refugees to the UK should have dental checks to determine their age. His view was criticised by the British Dental Association which issued a statement describing the test as &quot;inaccurate, inappropriate and unethical&quot;. The suggestion was also criticised by the British Association of Social Workers, and the test was also ruled out by the Home Office. 

In October 2016, Davies said that a child migrant arriving in the UK from Calais had &quot;lines around his eyes and looks older than I am.&quot; Davies appeared on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; on 19 October to defend dental checks, but became engaged in a heated exchange with Piers Morgan, who accused Davies of demonising refugee children, a charge which Davies denied. Later that year, Home Office figures revealed that more than two-thirds of refugees arriving in the UK who had their age assessed were over 18.

In August 2017, Davies criticised a senior Metropolitan Police officer for suggesting police should prioritise non-English speaking victims of crime amongst other vulnerable groups for personal visits from officers. Davies described the suggestion as &quot;appalling and discriminatory&quot;. Davies suggested that the police could save money by not paying for interpreters for non-English speaking victims of crime. When criticised by Matt Lucas on Twitter, Davies responded by calling him a &quot;leftie luvvie comedian&quot; and a &quot;moron&quot;, stating: &quot;You happily &#x27;blacked up&#x27; for a sketch, then accuse others of racism.&quot;

In April 2023 the Welsh Government wrote to Davies, asking for his consent for legal aid and £1,600 monthly payments to be given to some asylum seekers under their Basic Income pilot. Davies, describing the request as &quot;highly irresponsible&quot; and &quot;indefensible&quot;, and arguing the move would &quot;incentivise human traffickers&quot;, declined to approve it.

===Travellers===
In August 2023 Davies was reported to South Wales police during a consultation on potential traveller sites undertaken by Monmouthshire County Council. Davies suggested that the council&#x27;s consultation was inadequate, and published and distributed a leaflet to constituents in Monmouthshire, which, among other questions, asked &quot;would you like to see a Traveller site next to your house?&quot; Davies denied that the leaflet was racist – and was supported by Oliver Dowden, the Deputy Prime Minister – but traveller groups suggested that it was a further example of &quot;a &#x27;history of hostility&#x27; towards Traveller communities&quot; displayed by the Welsh Secretary over decades. South Wales police ultimately decided to take no further action. &quot;The Guardian&quot; later issued a correction, after wrongly attributing a disparaging comment on travellers made in 1999 to Davies.

===Climate change===
Davies called for a debate in Parliament on climate change in 2013 in which he questioned the scientific evidence for the role of human factors in global warming. Davies claimed that &quot;in the 1970s, everyone was predicting a forthcoming ice age&quot;. A study of the peer-reviewed literature on climate change published between 1965 and 1979 found just seven articles suggesting that the world might be cooling, and 44 proposing that it was likely to get warmer. The &quot;emphasis on greenhouse warming&quot;, it concludes, &quot;dominated the scientific literature even then&quot;.

Davies also criticised the government&#x27;s approach to pursuing low carbon energy saying, &quot;an unholy coalition of environmentalists working with big businesses have persuaded various British ministers to phase out cheap electricity from coal and gas and replace it with non-CO2 generating alternatives such as wind, solar and nuclear.&quot;

During a political discussion on climate change in 2016, Davies argued that temperature increases could be explained by the use of different thermometers. He stated that the level of global temperature increase was &quot;perfectly possible to explain away, because we are not comparing &#x27;like with like&#x27;. We are using slightly different temperature gauges, the areas in which we are using them have moved, some of the areas that they are in have changed over the years, and they can be subject to something called the urban heat island effect or to other natural factors. So there has not really been an increase since 1998.&quot;

In 2019, Davies said that he fully accepted the link between carbon dioxide and climate change. He also said he supported the UK government&#x27;s intention to become carbon neutral by 2050. In August 2019, Davies criticised the British band The 1975 for going on a world tour, accusing them of hypocrisy after producing a song about climate change.

===Sex and gender===
In 2000, Davies opposed the Blair governments&#x27; overturning of Section 28. In February Davies asked the Welsh Assembly Government&#x27;s local government secretary if the Assembly had the power to alter the Blair government&#x27;s bill to overturn the rule. In doing so he said &quot;I must not be interpreted as homophobic, nor should my party. But I don&#x27;t think schools should be encouraging homosexuality among people of 14 or 15 who are open to suggestions.&quot; Davies was told by the Assembly&#x27;s local government secretary Peter Law that the bill was primary legislation, and that the assembly had no power to alter it. Shortly thereafter, Davies set up a stall inside the Assembly building, presenting pre-Section 28 educational materials produced by local authorities discussing gay people in sex and relationships education. He was quoted in the South Wales Evening Post as describing the material as &quot;obscene&quot; and asking &quot;what impact [the material] could have on young people?&quot;. He was investigated by the Independent Adviser on Standards of Conduct for misusing Assembly stationary to invite people to see this display, but the case was dismissed.

In 2012, Davies opposed his Government&#x27;s plans to introduce same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom, describing them as &quot;barking mad&quot; due to the possibility that they may alienate the Conservative party&#x27;s traditional supporters; expanding on these views in a television interview he also expressed the opinion that &quot;most parents would prefer their children not to be gay&quot;. He also expressed concerns in relation to educating children about same sex relationships, stating in a 2012 radio interview; &quot;I just worry if children are going to be taught that [heterosexuality] isn&#x27;t necessarily the norm, and that you can carry on doing all sorts of other things, are we going to have a situation where the teacher’s saying, ‘Right, this is straight sex, this is gay sex, feel free to choose, it&#x27;s perfectly normal to want to do both. And you know, why not try both out?’ I mean, are we going to have that?&quot; Davies said he was not bigoted, offering the defence that he had once fought an amateur boxing match against the &quot;Pink Pounder&quot;, an openly gay boxer.

Davies has criticised reform of the Gender Recognition Act, stating that it would have &quot;a profound impact on the rights of others to maintain sex-based boundaries, protections and rights”. In 2019 he said that trans rights were &quot;overriding those of women&quot; and that trans activism is &quot;barking mad&quot;. In January 2018, Davies tweeted, &quot;Somebody possessing a penis and pair of testicles is definitely not a woman ... This should be a biological fact not a matter for political debate.&quot; In response he was accused of being a transphobe by the LGBT+ Conservatives group, who described his comment as &quot;abhorrent and out of kilter&quot; with the Conservative Party.

===&quot;Politicised&quot; charities===
Davies has been a critic of a number of national charities, such as Save the Children, the RSPCA and the NSPCC, which he regards as behaving in a politically motivated way, and was quoted in 2014 as saying that &quot;this is part of a pattern of charities which focus more on lobbying the government on issues than on their causes.&quot;

===Severn crossing===
In August 2012, Davies said that he had been persuaded that continuing with a private operator was not in the interests of bridge users, and called on his own government to take state control of the two Severn crossings so motorists and businesses can have VAT-free tolls on a permanent basis. Davies said: &quot;In normal circumstances I would be happy for a private company to run the bridges, but it&#x27;s important to be pragmatic. It&#x27;s clear that if the bridges are run by a state body, motorists and businesses would not have to pay VAT at 20% to drive across. The crossings are vital for the Welsh economy, and it&#x27;s important to get them down as much as possible.&quot;

<doc id="665209" wikidata="Q4043040" url="?curid=665209" title="Little Miss Muffet">
<text>&quot;Little Miss Muffet&quot; is an English nursery rhyme of uncertain origin, first recorded in 1805. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 20605. The rhyme has for over a century attracted discussion as to the proper meaning of the word tuffet.

==Wording==
The rhyme first appeared in print in &quot;Songs for the Nursery&quot; (1805), and there have been many variants since. &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes&quot; gives the following:

Older versions sometimes use &quot;of&quot; rather than &quot;her&quot; in line 3, and refer to a &quot;little spider&quot; as in this example dating between 1837 and 1845:

There are several early-published versions with significant variations including &quot;Little Mary Ester sat upon a tester&quot; (1812) and &quot;Little Miss Mopsey, Sat in the shopsey&quot; (1842). Other collected variants have included &quot;Little Miss Muffet, sat on a toffet&quot; (1830s?) and &quot;Little Miss Muffet, sat on a buffet&quot; (1840s?). In a later United States example, &quot;whey&quot; was replaced with &quot;pie&quot;.

==&quot;Tuffet&quot;==
Although the word &quot;tuffet&quot; is now sometimes used to mean a type of low seat, the word in the rhyme probably originally referred to a grassy hillock, small knoll or mound (a variant spelling of an obsolete and rare meaning of &quot;tuft&quot;). The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; calls the &quot;hassock or footstool&quot; meaning &quot;doubtful&quot;, and &quot;perhaps due to misunderstanding of the nursery rhyme&quot;. Many modern dictionaries including &quot;Collins&quot;, &quot;Merriam-Webster&quot;, &quot;Chambers 21st Century Dictionary&quot; and &quot;Oxford Dictionaries&quot;, however, now give both meanings.

=== Uncertain meaning ===
Since the rhyme provides little context, several writers have expressed confusion about its meaning. In 1902, Samuel M. Crothers remarked, &quot;Perhaps some of you would like to know what a tuffet is. I have thought of that myself, and have taken the trouble to ask several learned persons. They assure me that the most complete and satisfactory definition is,—a tuffet is the kind of thing that Miss Muffet sat on.&quot;

=== As a grassy mound ===
According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; the word in the nursery rhyme may refer to &quot;a grassy hillock, a small knoll or mound&quot;.

Earlier recorded examples of &quot;tuffet&quot; with the related meaning &quot;tuft&quot; (for example a cluster of short-stalked leaves or flowers growing from a common point) date back to 1553. The Merriam-Webster dictionary suggests that the word derives from the Anglo-French , from &quot;tufe&quot;, meaning &quot;tuft&quot;.

Many illustrators have shown Miss Muffet sitting on a mound or hillock, including John Everett Millais (1884) and Arthur Rackham (1913).

=== As a low seat ===
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; gives a secondary definition &quot;hassock or footstool&quot;, but calls this &quot;doubtful&quot;. It lists an example from 1895 in which the meaning is &quot;a three-legged stool&quot; and another from 1904 with the meaning &quot;footstool&quot;. Some sources, including &quot;Brewer&#x27;s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable&quot; (1898) and &quot;Chambers 20th Century Dictionary&quot; (1983), failed to recognise this meaning at all, and listed only the grassy knoll definition. Nevertheless, there is a long tradition of illustrators showing some sort of low seat, including Kate Greenaway (1900) and Frederick Richardson (1915).

An 1888 variant of the rhyme has &quot;she sat on a buffet&quot; which the scholars Iona and Peter Opie point out certainly refers to a stool.

==Origins==
The origins of the rhyme are unclear. Although no record has been found before 1805, Iona and Peter Opie argue that it is likely to be considerably older given its similarity to other rhymes such as &quot;Little Polly Flinders&quot;, &quot;Little Poll Parrot&quot;, &quot;Little Tommy Tacket&quot;, &quot;Little General Monk&quot; and &quot;Little Jack Horner&quot; (the last known to have been current at least as early as 1720). It is possible that all of these rhymes, and others, are parodies of whichever unknown rhyme came first.

It is sometimes claimed – without evidence – that the original Miss Muffet was Patience, daughter of Dr Thomas Muffet (d.1604), an English physician and entomologist, but the Opies are sceptical given the two-hundred-year gap between his death and the rhyme&#x27;s appearance. It has also been claimed to refer to Mary, Queen of Scots (1543–1587), frightened by the religious reformer John Knox (1510–1572).

== Cultural depictions ==
Several novels and films, including the Alex Cross novel &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot; (1993) and its eponymous 2001 film adaptation, take their titles from the poem&#x27;s crucial line.

<text>The Australian Corps was a World War I army corps that contained all five Australian infantry divisions serving on the Western Front. It was the largest corps fielded by the British Empire in France. At its peak the Australian Corps numbered 109,881 men. By 1918 the headquarters consisted of more than 300 personnel of all ranks, including senior staff officers, as well as supporting personnel such as clerks, drivers and batmen. Formed on 1 November 1917, the corps replaced I Anzac Corps while II Anzac Corps, which contained the New Zealand Division, became the British XXII Corps on 31 December. While its structure varied, Australian Corps usually included 4–5 infantry divisions, corps artillery and heavy artillery, a corps flying squadron and captive balloon sections, anti-aircraft batteries, corps engineers, corps mounted troops (light horse and cyclists), ordnance workshops, medical and dental units, transport, salvage and an employment company.

==History==
Following the hard fighting of 1917, where the Australian divisions suffered heavily at Bullecourt, Messines and the Third Battle of Ypres, the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) was facing a manpower crisis. One plebiscite for conscription had already failed and another would be defeated on 1 December 1917. Voluntary recruitment was declining. Plans to form a 6th Australian Division were scrapped and the incomplete formation was disbanded. To make up the numbers, it was proposed to disband the Australian 4th Division, numerically the weakest, but this was strongly resisted by the members of the AIF.

General William Birdwood, commander of the AIF, suggested that in forming the Australian Corps, the weakest division could serve as a depot, providing reserves for the fighting divisions. Field Marshal Douglas Haig, commander of the British Expeditionary Force, accepted this proposal. He had originally resisted combining the five Australian divisions into a single corps as he considered it too unwieldy. The Australian nature of the corps was enhanced by the attachment of No. 3 Squadron AFC plus Australian siege artillery batteries. It was also considered appropriate to appoint Australian officers to all senior command positions. However, Birdwood remained in command of the corps.

General Hubert Gough was dismissed from command of the British Fifth Army following its failure to withstand the German Spring Offensive of 1918. When Haig decided to reform the Fifth Army, he offered its command to Birdwood who accepted. This paved the way for an Australian to assume command of the corps, the highest field command held by an Australian in the war. The two candidates were Major General Cyril Brudenell White (Birdwood&#x27;s chief-of-staff) and Major General John Monash (commander of the 3rd Division). Monash, who was senior, had experience commanding troops in battle and was favoured by Haig and Birdwood, got the post in May 1918 and was promoted to lieutenant general. The Australian Corps was used extensively throughout the Hundred Days Offensive during which it achieved great success.

The 4th Division saw little rest in its role as the &quot;depot&quot;. In December 1917 it was moved into reserve near Péronne following the German counter-attack in the Battle of Cambrai. In January 1918, the division was returned to the front line south of Ypres as Haig acquiesced to French demands to take over more of the front. From this time until the Australians were withdrawn from fighting in early October, all divisions of the corps saw nearly continuous action. Rather than disbanding entire divisions, any consolidation of strength was made under the British system of reducing brigades from four battalions to three. During the Hundred Days campaign that ended the war, the Australian Corps, along with the Canadian Corps, were used repeatedly as spearheads for offensives. During the period August to October, 1918, General Monash reported that the Australian Corps had defeated some 39 German divisions, a full fifth of the entire German strength of 200 divisions on the Western Front.

== Organisation ==
The Corps comprised

* 1st Division
* 2nd Division
* 3rd Division
* 4th Division
* 5th Division
* 6th Division (broken up for reinforcements)

<doc id="665214" wikidata="Q5012350" url="?curid=665214" title="CKEM-DT">
<text>CKEM-DT (channel 51) is a television station in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, part of the Citytv network. It is owned and operated by Rogers Sports &amp; Media alongside Omni Television station CJEO-DT (channel 56). The two stations share studios with Rogers&#x27;s local radio stations on Gateway Boulevard in Edmonton; CKEM-DT&#x27;s transmitter is located near Yellowhead Highway/Highway 16A. The station also operates a rebroadcast transmitter (CKEM-DT-1, channel 4) in Red Deer.

CKEM was built as part of A-Channel, the regional television service constructed by Craig Broadcast Systems in 1997. Broadcasting from studios downtown in the historic Hudson&#x27;s Bay Building, it was the first new commercial TV station in Edmonton since 1974; its style of news and programming was young and aggressive. The station also broadcast Edmonton Oilers hockey for its first several years on air. Ratings settled into third place, above the CBC but behind the established stations in town, CFRN and CITV. However, the station lost ratings momentum following a five-month strike by unionized employees.

Craig, overextended by its launch of Toronto 1 in 2003, sold itself to CHUM Limited, then-owner of Citytv, in 2004. CHUM moved other media properties into the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Building, including a new radio station and Access Media Group; in 2005, the A-Channel stations took on the Citytv brand. Due to poor ratings and as part of a wave of layoffs, CHUM reduced the size of its local operation in Edmonton in 2006, cancelling the station&#x27;s evening newscast. CHUM sold most of its assets to Bell Globemedia that same year; as Bell owned the CTV Television Network, the Citytv stations were spun off to Rogers. The station continued producing a morning newscast under the &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; brand until 2015 and reinstated evening local news programs in 2017.

==A-Channel==

===Hearing process===
===Construction and early years===

With the licence awards approved, Craig began construction on the Edmonton station. In Edmonton, A-Channel set up in the heritage-listed Hudson&#x27;s Bay building on Jasper Avenue, where it added large windows to its streetside studio; historic preservation conditions complicated work, with new tiles having to be ordered from Quebec. It obtained rights to midweek telecasts of Edmonton Oilers hockey, In the Edmonton market, Craig scored a coup by rights to midweek telecasts of Edmonton Oilers hockey, which had been held by CFRN.

Most of the on-air talent hired for A-Channel Edmonton came from outside the market, except for Bruce Buchanan, who handled Oilers play-by-play. Darren Dreger was the first sports anchor, coming to the station from Winnipeg; Janis Mackey was a substitute anchor for CTV News in Toronto.

A-Channel launched in Edmonton on channel 51, cable 7 on September 18, 1997—two days before CKAL-TV in Calgary. The new station was the first addition to Edmonton broadcast television since CITV in 1974. Both stations relied on prime-time movies, a formula Craig had used with some success at MTN in Manitoba. For local programming, the station featured a two-hour morning show, &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;; 6 and 10 p.m. newscasts; and the local programs &quot;Live @ Five&quot; and &quot;Wired&quot;, among others.

A-Channel&#x27;s debut was riddled with technical issues. Jennifer Lyall, the co-host for the local &quot;Wired&quot; entertainment magazine, quit after just one day on air after not being given time to rehearse. News footage showed on the wrong stories or froze, while sound failed to play out. At one news conference, a local politician saw an A-Channel cameraman enter the room and began mouthing his words without speaking. The Calgary station also faced similar issues when it started. Many of the issues came down to the tapeless playback and editing system used for segments: over five days, the Calgary control room was rewired to bypass it in favor of older, but more reliable, video tape equipment, which led to far fewer on-air errors.

In the spring 1998 ratings, A-Channel Edmonton surpassed the CBC in prime time, but its local programs—outside of hockey—attracted few viewers. BBM found that &quot;Live@Five&quot;, the station&#x27;s 5:00 news program, had just 600 viewers. Over the next two years, the stations became more competitive with ratings rises for their local morning and evening programming.

Craig agreed in building A-Channel to provide some protection to rural broadcasters by delaying the launch of rebroadcasters for one year. This resulted in uproar from Oilers fans who lived outside of A-Channel&#x27;s coverage area and were shut out of seeing hockey. In December 1998, A-Channel debuted on cable in Red Deer, with a rebroadcaster following the next year.

On June 17, 1999, CKEM assignment editor Garnet Lewis was opening a videotape believed to contain news footage. It was actually a letter bomb, which exploded and injured Lewis and reporter Stacey Brotzel. The newsroom was able to return for its regular edition of &quot;News@Night&quot; after viewers saw the Calgary editions of the early evening news programs as a substitute. A month later, police arrested 28-year-old Raymond Neal Best for sending letter bombs to A-Channel and the Calgary police chief, as well as a hoax bomb to the police chief of Edmonton. Best was convicted of sending the bombs and sentenced to 12 years in prison.

For the second year, Gene Principe joined Buchanan on the Oilers telecasts and became A-Channel&#x27;s sports anchor. The Oilers departed A-Channel Edmonton after the 2000–2001 season and consolidated their television games with Sportsnet West, adding 20 games to the cable channel&#x27;s existing 28-game inventory. The team was believed to see increased revenue opportunity with a regional telecast. Principe, who had doubled as the sports director for A-Channel while appearing on its Oilers telecasts, left the station altogether to become a host for the Sportsnet telecasts.

===2003–2004 workers&#x27; strike===
In July 2002, a majority of A-Channel Edmonton employees signed union cards and organized under the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada (CEP), which represented employees at Edmonton&#x27;s other TV stations. Contract negotiations were unsuccessful, with the parties at odds over wages and a promise to not move jobs from Edmonton to Calgary; for the start of the fall television season, on September 17, 2003, workers walked out and began a strike. A-Channel continued airing newscasts because 10 to 15 employees crossed the picket line. Picketers made it difficult for employees to get inside the studios and sometimes followed news crews, while the union mounted a pressure campaign to urge national advertisers to cease doing business with A-Channel. Union members rejected a contract offer in December 2003, though about a third of the members had returned to work.

The strike was disastrous for A-Channel&#x27;s ratings in the Edmonton market. &quot;A-Channel News at Six&quot; lost more than 60 percent of its viewership and slipped into a tie with the CBC for last. At the same time, startup costs for Toronto 1, a new station which Craig had built in 2003, and a series of new digital specialty channels proved to be a drain on the company&#x27;s finances. In late January, Craig Media put itself up for sale. Weeks later, on February 14, strikers overwhelmingly voted to accept a contract offer, recognizing that much work was needed to regain the viewership that A-Channel had lost during the strike.

===Acquisition by CHUM===
On April 12, 2004, CHUM Limited announced a deal to purchase Craig Media for $265 million. The move came more than a month after the CRTC denied CHUM&#x27;s applications for new Calgary and Edmonton stations because the market did not have sufficient advertising revenue to support a new entrant. The sale was approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission on November 19, 2004. CHUM had to sell off Toronto 1 because it already owned stations in Toronto (CITY) and nearby Barrie (CKVR); Toronto 1 was sold to Quebecor Media, owners of the media units TVA and Sun Media.

CHUM brought other media holdings into the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Building on Jasper Avenue, which aside from A-Channel had few tenants. In February 2005, CHUM and Milestone Media launched a new Edmonton radio station, CHBN-FM &quot;91.7 The Bounce&quot;, and built a streetside radio studio for it next to A-Channel&#x27;s quarters. That same month, CHUM acquired all outstanding shares in Learning and Skills Television of Alberta (also known as Access Media Group), which operated Access, the provincial educational broadcaster. CHUM then moved Access Media Group&#x27;s operations from an east Edmonton industrial park into the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Building; traffic and master control were moved to Calgary and Toronto, resulting in 17 layoffs in Edmonton while creating four jobs in Calgary. The Calgary facility was already handling master control functions for A-Channel Edmonton.

==Citytv==
===Rebrand and news cuts===
In addition to launching The Bounce and becoming the sole owner of Access Media Group in February 2005, CHUM announced that it would rebrand the three A-Channel stations—in Calgary, Edmonton, and Winnipeg—as Citytv, aligning with the stations it already owned in Toronto and Vancouver. No other significant changes were made, since the A-Channel stations&#x27; on-air look had always been very similar to that of Citytv; they initially retained their local programs, relaunched under Citytv&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; morning brand and &quot;CityNews&quot; news brand. CHUM hoped to lift the stations&#x27; ratings with the new moniker. The change took effect on August 2 of the same year, when the A-Channel name was transferred to CHUM&#x27;s NewNet stations.

The rebrand failed to increase news ratings. The spring 2006 BBM survey showed that the 6 p.m. newscast on Citytv Edmonton had dipped from 11,000 viewers to 4,000. On July 12, 2006, CHUM announced that it would dramatically reduce its newsgathering operations in Edmonton, Calgary, and Winnipeg, as well as in several other cities. It laid off 195 part- and full-time employees, including 47 in Edmonton. The evening newscasts were cancelled, while the noon newscast remained and &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; was expanded; news anchor Paul Mennier remained to host a new evening newsmagazine program. In a coincidental development, that same day, BCE Inc., the parent company of CTV, announced it would buy CHUM Limited.

===Under Rogers ownership===

On July 12, 2006, Bell Globemedia (later known as CTVglobemedia, and now Bell Media) announced plans to take over CHUM Limited. On June 8, 2007, the CRTC announced its approval of CTVglobemedia&#x27;s purchase of CHUM Limited, but the commission added a condition that CTVglobemedia must sell off CHUM&#x27;s Citytv stations to another buyer while allowing it to retain the A-Channel stations. The following Monday, Rogers Communications agreed to buy the five Citytv stations. The sale was approved by the CRTC on September 28, 2007. In 2008, Rogers launched Omni Edmonton, part of its Omni Television multicultural station group. 

On January 19, 2010, &quot;CityNews at Noon&quot;, &quot;Your City&quot;, and &quot;CityNews International&quot; were cancelled as part of Citytv&#x27;s corporate restructuring and concurrent layoffs. The CRTC approved the installation of digital transmission facilities for CKEM-TV on channel 17 that same year, ahead of the August 31, 2011, digital television switchover date.

On May 7, 2015, Rogers announced that as part of further cuts, &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; would be cancelled on May 19, 2015. It was replaced by the spin-off &quot;Dinner Television&quot;, a two-hour newsmagazine and discussion program hosted by Jason Strudwick. The program did not feature original news reporting. An encore of the previous night&#x27;s &quot;Dinner Television&quot; with on-screen news, weather, and traffic updates replaced &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; in its morning timeslot. 

That December, the Rogers television stations in Edmonton moved from downtown to the headquarters of Rogers&#x27;s Edmonton radio stations on Gateway Boulevard. Where once CHUM had 220 employees in the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Building, there were fewer than two dozen when the company moved out. Some of the space was absorbed by the University of Alberta, which had previously purchased the historic structure.

On September 4, 2017, &quot;CityNews&quot; returned as part of a national expansion of local news programming across the Citytv stations, with &quot;Dinner Television&quot; being discontinued. CKEM airs two, hour-long newscasts at 6 and 11 p.m. nightly. Similarly to the format of its sister station in Toronto, Citytv Edmonton&#x27;s newscasts use an &quot;anchorless&quot; format where all stories are presented by videojournalists on the field, eschewing in-studio anchors.

* Bill Welychka – host of &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; (2005–2006)

==Technical information==
===Subchannel===
===Rebroadcaster===
CKEM-DT has one dependent rebroadcaster, in Red Deer. In 2020, the CRTC approved the conversion of CKEM-TV-1 in Red Deer from analogue to digital operation, switching from channel 4 to channel 15.

<doc id="665220" wikidata="Q7084562" url="?curid=665220" title="Old Mother Hubbard">
<text>&quot;Old Mother Hubbard&quot; is an English-language nursery rhyme, first given an extended printing in 1805, although the exact origin of the rhyme is disputed. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 19334. After a notable nursery success, it was eventually adapted to a large variety of practical and entertaining uses.

==Words==

The first published version of &quot;The Comic Adventures of Old Mother Hubbard and her Dog&quot; is attributed to Sarah Catherine Martin (1768–1826) and associated with a cottage in Yealmpton, Devon, close by where she was staying at Kitley House. The book was &quot;illustrated with fifteen elegant engravings on copper plate&quot; and had a dedication to her host &quot;J.B. Esq MP, at whose suggestion and at whose House these Notable Sketches were design’d&quot;, signed S. C. M.
The poem begins 
This is followed by a series of quatrains in similar format relating to the pair’s further activities, the number of stanzas varying in later publications. However, there is evidence to suggest that only the continuation after the first three stanzas was the work of Miss Martin. A review of her work that appeared in &quot;The Guardian of Education&quot; praised &quot;this little book, the poetry of which is of ancient date ... We can recollect, at this distance of time, that in our infant days the Story of this renowned woman, though full of inconsistencies we confess, afforded us much entertainment.&quot; Since the reviewer, Sarah Trimmer, was born in 1741, that would date back the rhyme&#x27;s earlier version fifty years or more.

A musical variant of the introductory verses was set by Samuel Arnold in his &quot;Juvenile Amusements&quot; (1797), except that it is not the dog but &quot;the poor Children&quot; who are the object of Mother Hubbard&#x27;s charity. Another song in Arnold&#x27;s work was &quot;There was an Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe&quot;, which had been given two final lines:

&lt;poem&gt;Then out went th’ old woman to bespeak ’em a coffin,
And when she came back, she found ’em all a-loffeing.&lt;/poem&gt;

On the basis of the coffin/laughing rhymes (which could date from Shakespearean times), James Orchard Halliwell was led to believe that &quot;the tale of &quot;Old Mother Hubbard&quot; is undoubtedly of some antiquity&quot;.

Another nonsense song with a similar template had been published two years before the appearance of Miss Martin’s Mother Hubbard variations. During the course of &quot;Old Dame Trot and her Wonderful Cat&quot; (1803), the Dame looks in the cupboard for fish but finds none, &quot;for puss had been there before&quot;. Two more suggestive stanzas follow:

Thereafter the cat continues to perform household chores and comic feats and the two exchange courtesies in the final stanza, much as do Mother Hubbard and her dog at the end of Miss Martin’s work. But while Mother Hubbard’s dog goes on to perform similar feats to Dame Trot’s cat, such as smoking, playing a musical instrument and riding another animal, he also shows his superior cleverness by sometimes anticipating what his mistress has brought on her return. He greets beer by sitting ready at table; he receives wine by exuberantly standing on his head; when linen comes, he is spinning; when stockings arrive, he is dressed already.

==Editions==
The book was immediately popular thanks to the astute marketing skills of the publisher, John Harris. To feed the enthusiasm he had created, Harris commissioned a separately published continuation from Martin in which the dog finds a bride, and early in the following year published &quot;a sequel…written by another hand&quot;. Such was the popular reputation of the work at that time that the satirist Peter Pindar made it a target in one of his pieces in which &quot;The Poet condemns the present general Taste and foretells the Return of the Ages of Barbarism&quot;:

:: In vain I preach, in vain in scorn I smile…
::Where Rapture doats on Mother Hubbard’s Tales!

Over the years pirated editions, new versions and imitations appeared from other presses, catering to the continuing demand. The first American edition of 1807 was marketed under the new title of &quot;A curious account of the comic adventures of Old Mother Hubbard and her dog&quot;. During the early years, the book illustrations had been based on those provided by the author, but the 1819 edition came with new designs ascribed to Allen Robert Branston and was further subtitled &quot;In which is shewn the wonderful powers that good old lady possessed in the education of her favourite animal&quot;.

The designs in books published outside London were often more basic, such as those in the 1840 edition from Devonport, which was retitled &quot;The droll adventures of Mother Hubbard and her dog&quot; and came with a rhymed summary of the story on its back cover; or the 1840 Banbury edition, to which were added several more stanzas that brought their number up to twenty-three. About that year also there appeared &quot;New Adventures of Mother Hubbard&quot;, in which the pair proceed to additional and more up to date adventures, such as paying a visit to the zoo and journeying by train and balloon.

Another enrichment was brought to the rhyme when it began to appear as a moveable book, so that the child could animate the scenes pictured. Paper tabs toward the bottom of the illustration could be pulled back and forth so as to make Mother Hubbard&#x27;s hands move, or her dog nod its head, bow, feed the cat and spin wool.

===Educational===
John Harris’ publications marked a shift from moralising works for children to catering for their imaginative entertainment, in which his Mother Hubbard series of books played a decisive part. Nevertheless, other publishers developed strategies whereby amusement and instruction might be combined. One American publisher included a complete set of serif type opposite the title page, featuring capitals, small letters, italics, ligatures and numbers, as an aid to further reading. An English printer served the same purpose by running capital and small letters and numerals along the top and bottom margins of his picture book. Later on, alphabet plates were introduced into the nursery with a scene from the rhyme to one side or at the centre (see opposite). Indeed, illustrations of Mother Hubbard and her dog were adapted to many other ends, from adorning money boxes so as to encourage thrift to a variation of the snap card game to develop memory.

==Translations==
From the 1830s there were a number of translations and adaptations of the rhyme in Europe. In France appeared &quot;Aventures plaisantes de Madame Gaudichon et de son chien (1832), imitées de l’anglais&quot; (imitated from the English), in which the dog had been given the name Zozo. In about 1830 there was a German translation, &quot;Komische Abentheuer der Frau Hubbard und ihrein Hunde&quot; (The comic adventures of Dame Hubbard and her dog), which adapted the Robert Branston illustrations and was published in Mainz. It was followed some years later by another German translation that also used the Branston illustrations, &quot;Geschichte der Madam Rips und ihres Hundes Bello&quot; (The tale of Madam Rep and her dog Woof).

Later came two Dutch translations: In the 1850s, &quot;Kluchtige tafereelen van Grootje Goedsloof met haar aardig hondje Blaf&quot; (Comical scenes of Granny Goodleaf with her pretty doggy Woof). In that, the Branston illustrations are provided with rhyming captions and the story is told in a more leisurely manner. It was followed in 1860 by &quot;Moeder Hubbard en haar hond&quot;. Though that keeps more or less to the original story-line, it too is at wordier length. The opening lines, which have no English counterpart, give a fair idea of its discursive style.

In 1976 there was a Chinese translation by H.Y. Xiao, which was accompanied by the detailed Walter Crane illustrations of 1873. Gabriella Rouf returned to Robert Branston&#x27;s designs to accompany her more recent Italian translation &quot;Le divertenti avventure di Nonna Renza e il suo cane&quot; (2014). In this, Granny Rep (Nonna Renza) is named for the rep material once used to make what were known as Mother Hubbard dresses after the nursery rhyme that was their inspiration.

There have also been two Russian translations of the rhyme. &quot;Babushka Zabavushka i sobachka Bum&quot; (The Jolly Grandma and her Little Dog Boom, 1906), in the version by Raisa Kudasheva (1878-1964), contained the additional detail of the dog&#x27;s taking a sled ride. But while it is the dog&#x27;s ingenuity which has usually been emphasised, the &quot;Pudel&quot; of Samuil Marshak’s 1927 adaptation is almost purely mischievous. This in turn was adapted by Nina Shorina (born 1943) into her short animated film of 1985.

==Byproducts==
===Pantomime===
A comic sketch published in 1818 has a character expostulate: &quot;Is it not ridiculous for us grown people to be going to see Mother Goose, Tom Thumb, Old Mother Hubbard, and suchlike infantile fooleries; or to misspend our time at pantomimes and at rope dancings?&quot; What kind of show contained those characters is not explained. It was not until a decade later that there was mention of a Christmas pantomime, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, that was &quot;founded on the familiar nursery-tale of Old Mother Hubbard and her dog&quot;.
Thereafter, as many familiar characters as possible were packed into the same production, which was given a composite title. &quot;Mother Hubbard and Her Dog or Harlequin &amp; Tales of the Nursery&quot;, by Thomas John Dibdin and Charles Farley, was put on in 1833 at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden. And for the 1861-2 season at Drury Lane there was &quot;Harlequin and the House that Jack Built or Old Mother Hubbard and her Wonderful Dog&quot; by E.L.Blanchard. In this the scene opened in Mother Hubbard&#x27;s cottage, where she and her dog were joined by her former rivals, Dame Trot with her cat and Dame Wiggins of Lee.

The custom of cross referencing has persisted: as in David Wood’s 1975 script, where Mother Hubbard is reunited, as she was two centuries before, with the old woman who lived in a shoe. More recently still, Paul Reakes has provided a twist to the genre with his &quot;Old Mother Hubbard - A Wild West Pantomime Adventure&quot; (1993).

===Comic parodies===
In 1837, John Hannah, then an undergraduate at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, published a spoof textual criticism of &quot;Old Mother Hubbord&quot;, supposedly written in A.D. 3211 by a New Zealand academic who tries to relate the poem to the nearly forgotten 19th-century civilisation which produced it. Another very popular parody was the sermon &quot;illustrating the method upon which some parsons construct their discourses&quot;, with the rhyme&#x27;s first stanza as text, that appeared anonymously in newspapers between the 1870s and 1880s. Beginning from Britain, the item spread under such titles as &quot;A Model Sermon&quot;, &quot;Modern Sermon&quot; or &quot;A sermon of the olden times&quot;, as far as the United States and New Zealand. In Britain it was incorporated into a chapter of the Earl of Desart&#x27;s novel, &quot;Children of Nature&quot; (1878). In the United States it was provided with a refutation and appeared as a pamphlet under the title &quot;Who was Old Mother Hubbard?&quot; (1882/5).
Later parodies centred largely on the bareness of the cupboard in the first stanza. A postcard advertisement for Dr. Swett&#x27;s Root Beer concludes that Mother Hubbard was unable to quench her thirst because “The kiddies had been there first”. Another postcard implied that it was the dog had been there before. In a newspaper cartoon of &quot;Mother Hubbard up to date&quot; from 1904, she phones the butcher to get the poor dog a bone. Two more sexually suggestive postcards from 1910 play with the concept of bareness. In one, Mother Hubbard has gone 

Alternatively she went &quot;to get her poor daughter a dress&quot;, but &quot;the cupboard was bare, and so was her daughter, I guess.&quot;

Parodies have continued into the musical sphere too. There was a comic quartet by the Australian clergyman Alfred Wheeler, first performed during the 1920s. This consisted of a reworking of the rhyme&#x27;s opening stanza in which the principal effects are variations on &quot;Bow-wow&quot;. It was shortly followed by Victor Hely-Hutchinson&#x27;s &quot;Old Mother Hubbard set in the manner of Handel&quot; (1932), where the rhyme&#x27;s opening stanza is treated in the style of an oratorio.

===Political use===
In the Elizabethan era there had been a much earlier &quot;Mother Hubberd&#x27;s Tale&quot; by Edmund Spenser published in 1591, but that was quite different from the nursery rhyme, being a satirical beast fable concerning an ape and a fox. It was followed in 1604 by Thomas Middleton&#x27;s &quot;Father Hubburd’s Tales&quot;, which contained the equally political fable of &quot;The Nightingale and the Ant&quot;. It has also been claimed that Martin&#x27;s rhyme was mistakenly thought by some to have a political meaning at first, although there is no reliable evidence that this was so. However, it was soon given various political contexts. In one parliamentary debate, George Canning compared the vitality of the British constitution, then declared to be under threat, to the swift revival of Mother Hubbard&#x27;s dog when she bought him a coffin. And at a later date her bare cupboard was introduced into several political cartoons, generally dealing with financial deficits. These included items in the American publications &quot;The Wasp&quot; (1881), &quot;Judge&quot; (1897), and &quot;Spokesman Review&quot;, titled &quot;Mother Hubbard up to date&quot;. There was also a British poster of 1905 titled &quot;The Cupboard Still Bare&quot;.

<doc id="665226" wikidata="Q6650491" url="?curid=665226" title="Little Jack Horner">
<text>&quot;Little Jack Horner&quot; is a popular English nursery rhyme with the Roud Folk Song Index number 13027. First mentioned in the 18th century, it was early associated with acts of opportunism, particularly in politics. Moralists also rewrote and expanded the poem so as to counter its celebration of greediness. The name of Jack Horner also came to be applied to a completely different and older poem on a folkloric theme; and in the 19th century, it was claimed that the rhyme was originally composed in satirical reference to the dishonest actions of Thomas Horner in the Tudor period.

==Lyrics and melody==
The song’s most common lyrics are:

It was first documented in full in the nursery rhyme collection &quot;Mother Goose&#x27;s Melody, or, Sonnets for the Cradle&quot;, which may date from 1765, although the earliest surviving English edition is from 1791.

The melody commonly associated with the rhyme was first recorded by the composer and nursery rhyme collector James William Elliott, in his &quot;National Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Songs&quot; (1870).

==Origin and meaning==

The earliest reference to the well-known verse is in &quot;Namby Pamby,&quot; a satire by Henry Carey published in 1725, in which he himself italicised lines dependent on the original:

This occurrence has been taken to suggest that the rhyme was well-known by the early eighteenth century. Carey&#x27;s poem ridicules fellow writer Ambrose Philips, who had written infantile poems for the young children of his aristocratic patrons. Although several other nursery rhymes are mentioned in his poem, the one about Little Jack Horner has been associated with acts of opportunism ever since. Just six years later, it figured in another satirical work, Henry Fielding&#x27;s &quot;The Grub Street Opera&quot; (1731). Fielding’s rendition had the prime minister, Robert Walpole, as its target, and ended with all the characters processing off the stage &quot;to the music of Little Jack Horner.&quot;

The political theme was later taken up by Samuel Bishop, one of whose epigrams describes the Civil service bureaucracy and enquires:
 
Soon after, Thomas Love Peacock took up the theme in his satirical novel, &quot;Melincourt&quot; (1817). In &quot;Melincourt&quot;, five go-getting characters contribute to a song describing how they misuse their trades to fleece the public. It begins with the recitative:

Each in turn then describes the nature of his sharp practice in his particular profession, followed by the general chorus: “And we&#x27;ll all have a finger, a finger, a finger, / We&#x27;ll all have a finger in the CHRISTMAS PIE.”

Adeline Dutton Train Whitney likewise applied the nursery rhyme to opportunism in American society in &quot;Mother Goose for grown folks: a Christmas reading&quot; (New York, 1860). The privileged little boy grows up to become “John, Esquire,” and goes in search of richer plums, where he is joined in his quest by &quot;female Horners.&quot;

John Bellenden Ker Gawler charged the mediaeval legal profession with similar interested motives in his &quot;Essay on the Archaiology of Popular English Phrases and Nursery Rhymes&quot; (Southampton, 1834). Claiming to trace back the rhyme of Little Jack Horner to its &quot;Low Saxon&quot; origin, he then &#x27;translates&#x27; the social criticism he discovers there, and adds an anti-clerical commentary of his own.

Such social criticism was reapplied in earnest to the 20th century in an antiauthoritarian lyric from Danbert Nobacon’s &quot;The Unfairy Tale&quot; (1985). The schoolboy Jack Horner is put in the corner for resisting the racist and self-regarding interpretation of history given by his teacher. But eventually, the children rise up to defend him:

==&quot;What a good boy am I!&quot;==
Jack Horner’s opportunism made him a target for adult moralists from the start. At a basic level, the nursery rhyme&#x27;s hearty celebration of appetite seems an endorsement of greediness. Therefore, it was not long before educators of the young began to rewrite the poem in order to recommend an alternative attitude. In &quot;The Renowned History of Little Jack Horner&quot;, dating from the 1820s, generous Jack gives his pie to a poor woman on his way to school, and is rewarded with a newly baked pie on his return home. The poem concludes by reversing the picture presented in the original rhyme:

The poem was republished later with different illustrations as &quot;The Amusing History of Little Jack Horner&quot; (1830–1832), and again with different illustrations as &quot;Park&#x27;s Amusing History of Little Jack Horner&quot; (1840). Contemporaneously in America, the same recommendation to share with friends was made by Fanny E. Lacy in the first of the expanded &quot;Juvenile Songs&quot; of her composition. Yet another collection of rewritten rhymes published in 1830 featured a Jack Horner who is unable even to spell the word &#x27;pie&#x27; (spelled &#x27;pye&#x27; in the original version).
After such an onslaught, it is something of a reformed Jack Horner, harnessed to educational aims, who appears on the Staffordshire Potteries ABC plates of the 1870s and 1880s, as well as on a Mintons tile for the nursery, where the feasting Jack is accompanied by a parental figure carrying keys. There was an educational aim in the card games where Jack Horner figured too. In the American version, originating with the McLoughlin Brothers in 1888, the object was to collect suits in the form of four different varieties of plum in their respective pies. In De La Rue&#x27;s &quot;Little Jack Horner Snap&quot; (1890), thirteen different nursery rhymes form the suits to be collected.

==Humour==
Jack Horner’s adventures with his pie have frequently been referenced in humorous and political cartoons on three continents. In an 1862 issue of &quot;Punch&quot;, Abraham Lincoln pulls the captured New Orleans out of his pie. In the following century, a copy of the &quot;Tacoma Times&quot; pictured a Japanese Jack pulling a battleship from the Russian pie during the Russo-Japanese war. In other contexts, the rhyme was applied to Australian politics in the &quot;Melbourne Punch&quot;; to a Canadian railway scandal; to income tax relief in Ireland; and to David Lloyd George’s use of his party political fund.
Other humorous uses of the nursery rhyme include: a comic variation in Guy Wetmore Carryl’s &quot;Mother Goose for Grown Ups&quot; (New York, 1900), in which Jack breaks his tooth on a plum stone; and one of Lee G. Kratz’s &quot;Humorous Quartets for Men’s Voices&quot; (Boston, 1905), in which the pie is stolen by a cat.

==Alternative histories==
In the chapbook &quot;The History of Jack Horner, Containing the Witty Pranks he play&#x27;d, from his Youth to his Riper Years, Being pleasant for Winter Evenings&quot; (mid-18th century), there is a summarised version of the nursery rhyme which Jack himself is said to have composed. However, it has been observed that the story is based on the much earlier Tudor tale of &quot;The Fryer and the Boy&quot;, and that this insertion is merely to justify the use of Jack Horner&#x27;s name. The book’s main purpose is to follow its hero’s career after he has left childhood behind.

In the 19th century, a story began to gain currency that the rhyme is actually about Thomas Horner, who was steward to Richard Whiting, the last abbot of Glastonbury before the dissolution of the monasteries under Henry VIII of England. It is asserted that, prior to the abbey&#x27;s destruction, the abbot sent Horner to London with a huge Christmas pie which had the deeds to a dozen manors hidden within it as a gift to try to convince the King not to nationalise Church lands. During the journey, Horner opened the pie and extracted the deeds of the manor of Mells in Somerset, which he kept for himself. It is further suggested that, since the manor properties included lead mines in the Mendip Hills, the plum is a pun on the Latin &quot;plumbum&quot;, for lead. While records do indicate that Thomas Horner became the owner of the manor, subsequent owners of Mells Manor have asserted that the legend is untrue, and that Wells purchased the deed from the abbey.

Two later novels provide virtuous heroes named Jack Horner that distance themselves from the nursery character. The first chapter of James Jackson Wray&#x27;s &quot;Jack Horner the second&quot; (London, 1887) criticises the behaviour of the first Jack Horner in order to emphasise the preferable behaviour of his virtuous namesake. The &quot;charming little boy&quot; featured in Mary Spear Tiernan&#x27;s eponymous &quot;Jack Horner: A Novel&quot; (Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co, 1890) is equally contrasting. An American foundling, he is so named from being discovered in the Christmas season.

By the second half of the 20th century, the pendulum had swung back to interpreting versions of Jack Horner as a psychologically damaged character. Commenting on the role of Jacob Horner, the dysfunctional narrator of his novel &quot;The End of the Road&quot; (1958), John Barth commented that &quot;he is supposed to remind you first of Little Jack Horner, who also sits in a corner and rationalizes.&quot;

In 2022, an adult version of Jack Horner appears as a villain in the Universal Pictures/DreamWorks Animation movie &quot;Puss in Boots: The Last Wish&quot;. The owner of a pie business, he now calls himself &quot;Big&quot; Jack Horner.

<text>CKAL-DT (channel 5) is a television station in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, part of the Citytv network. It is owned and operated by Rogers Sports &amp; Media alongside Omni Television station CJCO-DT (channel 38). The two stations share studios at 7 Avenue and 5 Street Southwest in Downtown Calgary; CKAL-DT&#x27;s transmitter is located near Old Banff Coach Road/Highway 563.

CKAL was built as part of A-Channel, the regional television service constructed by Craig Broadcast Systems in 1997. Broadcasting from studios downtown, it was the first new commercial TV station in Calgary since 1975; its style of news and programming was young and aggressive. Ratings settled into third place, above the CBC but behind the established stations in town, CFCN and CICT.

Craig, overextended by its launch of Toronto 1 in 2003, sold itself to CHUM Limited, then-owner of Citytv, in 2004. In 2005, the A-Channel stations took on the Citytv brand. Due to poor ratings and as part of a wave of layoffs, CHUM reduced the size of its local operation in Calgary in 2006, cancelling the station&#x27;s evening newscast. CHUM sold most of its assets to Bell Globemedia that same year; as Bell owned the CTV Television Network, the Citytv stations were spun off to Rogers. The station reinstated evening local news programs in 2018 but cancelled its version of &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; in 2020.

==A-Channel==

===Hearing process===
===Construction and early years===

With the licence awards approved, Craig began construction on the Calgary station. It built studios downtown at 7th Avenue and 5th Street SW, adjacent to the LRT system; this made A-Channel the only major media outlet in the city to be built in the downtown area. As in Edmonton, much of the on-air talent came from elsewhere in Canada.

A-Channel launched in Edmonton on September 18, 1997. Two days later, CKAL-TV launched on channel 5, cable 8. Both stations relied on prime-time movies, a formula Craig had used with some success at MTN in Manitoba. For local programming, the station featured a two-hour morning show, &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;; 6 and 10 p.m. newscasts; and the local programs &quot;Live @ Five&quot; and &quot;Wired&quot;, among others. The station&#x27;s early weeks on air were riddled with technical issues, some of which also befell the Edmonton station. Many of the issues came down to the tapeless playback and editing system used for segments: over five days, the Calgary control room was rewired to bypass it in favor of older, but more reliable, video tape equipment, which led to far fewer on-air errors. A-Channel had a Hummer as a news vehicle; when the city experienced heavy snowfall in March 1998, it used the Hummer to deliver Meals on Wheels and to ferry snowed-in doctors to the hospital.

Craig agreed in building A-Channel to provide some protection to rural broadcasters by delaying the launch of rebroadcasters for one year. As a result, A-Channel did not open its repeater in Lethbridge, authorized with the rest of the network, until September 1998.

BBM figures for spring 1998 showed A-Channel Calgary in third place in prime time, though its dinner-hour news lagged the CBC. Over the next two years, the stations became more competitive with ratings rises for their local morning and evening programming. In local news, the stations built identities as aggressive outlets. In an assessment of the Calgary station in 1999, Gary Davies noted, &quot;It&#x27;s very rare to attend a media event in this city and not see a representative from A-Channel.&quot;

===Acquisition by CHUM===
On April 12, 2004, CHUM Limited announced a deal to purchase Craig Media for $265 million. The move came more than a month after the CRTC denied CHUM&#x27;s applications for new Calgary and Edmonton stations because the market did not have sufficient advertising revenue to support a new entrant. With the sale pending, Craig cut costs; in May 2004, the company laid off nine employees at A-Channel Calgary and another twenty-eight at Toronto 1. The sale was approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission on November 19, 2004. CHUM had to sell off Toronto 1 because it already owned stations in Toronto (CITY) and nearby Barrie (CKVR); Toronto 1 was sold to Quebecor Media, owners of the media units TVA and Sun Media.

CHUM acquired all outstanding shares in Learning and Skills Television of Alberta (also known as Access Media Group)—which operated Access, the provincial educational broadcaster—in February 2005. CHUM then consolidated Access Media Group&#x27;s Edmonton operations with its own; traffic and master control were moved to Calgary and Toronto, resulting in 17 layoffs in Edmonton while creating four jobs in Calgary. The Calgary facility was already handling master control functions for A-Channel Edmonton.

==Citytv==

===Rebrand and news cuts===
In addition to launching The Bounce and becoming the sole owner of Access Media Group in February 2005, CHUM announced that it would rebrand the three A-Channel stations—in Calgary, Edmonton, and Winnipeg—as Citytv, aligning with the stations it already owned in Toronto and Vancouver. No other significant changes were made, since the A-Channel stations&#x27; on-air look had always been very similar to that of Citytv; they initially retained their local programs, relaunched under Citytv&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; morning brand and &quot;CityNews&quot; news brand. CHUM hoped to lift the stations&#x27; ratings with the new moniker. The change took effect on August 2 of the same year, when the A-Channel name was transferred to CHUM&#x27;s NewNet stations.

On June 13, 2006, CHUM announced that it would dramatically reduce its newsgathering operations in Edmonton, Calgary, and Winnipeg, as well as in several other cities. It laid off 195 part- and full-time employees. The evening newscasts were cancelled, while the noon newscast and &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; remained on the air. In a coincidental development, that same day, BCE Inc., the parent company of CTV, announced it would buy CHUM Limited.

===Under Rogers ownership===

The CRTC announced its approval of CTVglobemedia&#x27;s purchase of CHUM Limited on June 8, 2007, but the commission added a condition that CTVglobemedia sell off CHUM&#x27;s Citytv stations to another buyer while allowing it to retain the A-Channel stations. The following Monday, Rogers Communications agreed to buy the five Citytv stations. The sale was approved by the CRTC on September 28, 2007. In 2008, Rogers launched Omni Calgary, part of its Omni Television multicultural station group.

On January 19, 2010, &quot;CityNews at Noon&quot;, &quot;Your City&quot;, and &quot;CityNews International&quot; were cancelled as part of Citytv&#x27;s corporate restructuring and concurrent layoffs; &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; was trimmed from four hours to three. The CRTC approved the installation of digital transmission facilities for CKAL-TV on channel 49 that same year, ahead of the August 31, 2011, digital television switchover date. In 2011, Rogers also converted the Lethbridge transmitter to digital operation.

Another eight years would pass before the station resumed offering evening news programming; as part of a larger expansion of local news programming across the Citytv stations, Citytv Calgary debuted hour-long 6 and 11 p.m. newscasts on September 3, 2018. Rogers laid off 11 employees in Calgary on September 5, 2019, and placed &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; on hiatus until September 23. At that time, the program was relaunched with a new hybrid format, consisting of a mixture of local content with national entertainment and lifestyle segments produced from Toronto. The program continued for another 14 months until it was cancelled as part of a round of cuts conducted by Rogers Sports &amp; Media across the country.

<text>Sydney Hospital, historically known as the Rum Hospital, is a major hospital in Sydney, Australia, located on Macquarie Street in the Sydney central business district. It is the oldest hospital in Australia, dating back to 1788, and has been at its current location since 1811. It first received the name Sydney Hospital in 1881.

Currently the hospital comprises 113 inpatient beds. There are about 400 staff members. Specialist services attract patients from all over New South Wales. It specialises in ophthalmology and hand surgery and is a referral hospital for patients requiring these services. It also houses a rudimentary 6-bed Emergency Department.

Sydney Hospital became a teaching hospital of the University of Sydney in 1909. Sydney Hospital is associated with Sydney Medical School of the University of Sydney through the Discipline of Clinical Ophthalmology and Eye Health and Save Sight Institute. It is also the location of a number of research institutes associated with the University, including the Heart Research Institute, the Centenary Institute for Cancer Medicine and Cell Biology, the Kanematsu Memorial Institute of Pathology and the General Endocrinology Group.

==Early history==

===1788 and the Tent Hospital===
Many of the 736 convicts who survived the voyage of the First Fleet from Portsmouth, England arrived suffering from dysentery, smallpox, scurvy, and typhoid. Soon after landing Governor Phillip and Surgeon-General John White established a tent hospital along what is now George Street in The Rocks to care for the worst cases. Subsequent convict boatloads had even higher rates of death and disease. A portable hospital which was prefabricated in England from wood and copper arrived in Sydney with the Second Fleet in 1790. Present-day Nurses Walk in The Rocks cuts across where the site of the early hospital once was. John White was Surgeon-General at Sydney Cove between 1788 and 1794.

===Governor Macquarie&#x27;s Rum Hospital===
Upon his arrival in the Colony of New South Wales at the beginning of 1810, Governor Macquarie discovered that the Sydney Cove&#x27;s hospital was an affair of tents and temporary buildings. Macquarie set aside land on the western edge of the Government Domain for a new hospital and created a new road – Macquarie Street – to provide access to it. Plans were drawn up but the British Government refused to provide funds to build the hospital. Consequently, Macquarie entered into a contract with a consortium of businessmen–Garnham Blaxcell, Alexander Riley and, later, D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth–to erect the new hospital. They were to receive convict labour and supplies and a monopoly on rum imports from which they expected to recoup the cost of the building and gain considerable profits. The contract allowed them to import 45,000 (later increased to 60,000) gallons of rum to sell to colonists and was signed on 6 November 1810. In the event, the hospital did not turn out to be very profitable for the contractors. Convict patients were transferred to Governor Macquarie&#x27;s new hospital in 1816.

It is unclear who prepared the design for the three Old Colonial Georgian buildings comprising the Sydney Hospital complex, but there were apparently many involved with its construction. There is speculation that both Governor Macquarie and John O&#x27;Hearen contributed to the design. John O’Hearen is probably the stronger contender for being the building&#x27;s designer, for he not only defended the methods of its construction against critics but also signed himself as &#x27;Architect&#x27; in related correspondence.

===Shoddy construction===

As the hospital was nearing completion in 1815, the now famous convict architect Francis Greenway was asked to report on the quality of the work. He condemned it, claiming that it &quot;must soon fall into ruin&quot;. Short-cuts had been taken with the construction and there were weak joints in the structural beams, rotting stonework, feeble foundations, and dry rot in the timbers. Macquarie ordered the contractors to remedy these defects but by 1820 the southern wing was deemed particularly unsafe, with reports that some of it had collapsed and had to be rebuilt. Around this time, Greenway was commissioned to undertake repairs to both the wings of the hospital, including alterations to the roof of the southern wing and the rearrangement of its internal spaces. More substantial repairs were carried out on the southern wing in 1826. Many defects present from the original construction remained hidden away until the extensive restoration of the 1980s.
==Alternative uses==
The scale of the hospital was greater than that which could be sustained by Sydney at that time. The new hospital had a large central building, which was the main hospital, and two smaller wings which were quarters for the surgeons. From the start, portions of the buildings were allocated for non-medical purposes. During construction there was ongoing debate about the hospital&#x27;s future possible use.

===The North Wing===
Governor Macquarie was under pressure, both within the colony and from Lord Bathurst, to utilise part of the General Hospital as a temporary Supreme Court, perhaps while awaiting the construction of the Greenway designed law courts opposite. Macquarie capitulated and the northern wing (originally designed for the Principal Surgeon) and a portion of the central building were given over to Supreme Court Judge Jeffrey Hart Bent as chambers as well as for a temporary courthouse.

The first Surgeon to reside at the hospital&#x27;s Surgeons quarters was D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth, whose other connections with the building are interesting. First, he had been one of the three contractors who had built the Hospital under the &quot;rum contract&quot; with Macquarie, and secondly, his son, William Charles Wentworth, explorer and journalist, became one of the most important figures in the development of Parliamentary democracy in New South Wales, and is regarded as the &quot;father of the constitution&quot;. He is well commemorated by artworks within Parliament House.

On 3 January 1829, Governor Darling released a despatch foreshadowing the intended appropriation of the North Wing for the accommodation of the Legislative Councils. The first meeting of the 14 member Legislative Council in the North Wing occurred on 21 August 1829. The &#x27;First Legislative Council&#x27; stayed until 1848. During this time the surgeons continued to occupy about one third of the space. Other rooms were sometimes occupied by other government officials, such as the Principal Supervisor of Convicts, until 1852, when the Legislature took over the entire building.

===The South Wing===
When the General Hospital was completed in 1816 the southern wing was used for its planned purpose as the quarters for the Assistant Surgeon as well as a storage facility. However, from 1823 the 39th Regiment, and briefly the 57th Regiment, used some of the rooms as hospital wards. The staff office (including &quot;clerical offices and a medical depot&quot;) for the Military occupied the southern wing until 1854. From 1836, the Store Master also lived there, sharing the upper rooms with the Assistant Surgeon.

There were plans for the southern wing to become a military hospital in 1840, however this did not come to fruition.
Colonial governments accepted a degree of responsibility for pauper patients who were not convicts. However, as convict numbers declined and the emancipated and free population grew, the government disengaged itself from direct responsibility for the &#x27;respectable poor&#x27;. Meanwhile, the Sydney Dispensary had been created in 1826 to provide outpatient care for &#x27;free poor persons, unable to pay for medical attendance&#x27;. It was conducted on traditional charitable lines and operated from several city premises before obtaining the south wing of the Rum Hospital in 1845 where it remained until 1848. This change in use of the South Wing required more repairs to the internal and external building fabric from 1843. At the same time, the Sydney Dispensary expanded to serve inpatients and changed its name to the Sydney Infirmary and Dispensary, a title officially approved in 1844. Convict inpatients continued to be treated in the separately managed hospital in the centre wing, next door. With the dissolution of the convict hospital system, the Sydney Infirmary and Dispensary gave up the south wing in 1848 in return for permissive occupancy of the entire middle section of the Rum Hospital complex.
In 1851, the New South Wales Legislative Council petitioned to establish a mint in Sydney, to take advantage of the gold discovered by Edward Hargraves at Ophir, just outside Bathurst. This proposal received Royal Assent in 1853. Plans were drawn up for the Sydney branch on a site selected at the corner of Bridge and Macquarie Streets, however it was decided to locate the mint in the southern wing of the general hospital to save time and costs. The South Wing officially became the Sydney branch of the Royal Mint in 1854. Its establishment required the extensive internal remodelling of the former hospital wing for accommodation for the Mint Master, administrative offices and receiving and storage rooms for bullion. Land to the rear of the building was also developed, with prefabricated industrial buildings for rolling, assaying and coining imported from England and erected around a courtyard directly behind the former hospital building. The Mint was shut down in 1926 when the Royal Melbourne Mint became the mint of the Commonwealth. The building has since accommodated numerous government departments and various law courts.

In 1982 the Mint Offices building opened as &quot;Australia&#x27;s first museum of historical decorative arts, stamps and coins&quot;, although the coining factory buildings at the rear continued to be used as law courts and as a workshop for the Department of Public Works. The Mint Museum won both the New South Wales and National Museum of the Year Awards in 1983. In 1993-5 the museum was re-developed as the Sydney Mint Museum, focusing on the impact of the Gold Rush years on New South Wales and the role of The Mint as a coining factory. However, this re-developed museum was short-lived, closing in 1997. The property, comprising The Mint Offices and courtyard was transferred to the Historic Houses Trust in 1998.
===The Central Building===
The deteriorated centre building was demolished in 1879 and in 1880 Thomas Rowe won an architectural competition held to find a new design with his Victorian Classical Revival design. Rowe was heavily criticised by his peers for the practice of under quoting building costs in order to win a competition, and the Sydney Infirmary was his &quot;&quot;. Work halted for some years after partial construction, awaiting the approval of additional funds from the New South Wales parliament. Architect John Kirkpatrick completed the new hospital in 1894 to a revised design.

==Lucy Osburn==
New South Wales politician Henry Parkes (who later became premier) was concerned about the state of the Sydney Infirmary and Dispensary and appealed for help to Florence Nightingale for trained nurses. Consequently, in March 1868 Lucy Osburn was sent out as Lady Superintendent of the Infirmary and was accompanied by five trained nurses. Osburn won Parkes&#x27; trust and began the challenging task of cleaning up the crumbling, foul-smelling and vermin-infested Infirmary. A week after their arrival they had a royal patient, when the Duke of Edinburgh was wounded by a would-be assassin at Clontarf. They nursed him at Government House, not Sydney Hospital. In spite of the public acclaim this brought them, Lucy Osburn and her staff faced much resistance in their efforts to reform the infirmary. In addition to the appalling conditions, they met with hostility and opposition. The idea of gentlewomen working as hospital nurses was still novel, and to many people shocking. Lucy was continually obstructed by one surgeon, Dr Alfred Roberts, and personally attacked in the Parliament.A Royal Commission on public charities in 1873 condemned the Sydney Infirmary, accusing the management committee of neglect and interfering in the duties of the nurses. Osburn was vindicated and the commission praised her work toward the improvement in the standards of nursing. A number of the Lucy Osburn&#x27;s Sisters took up positions as matrons at various hospitals. By these means the Nightingale teaching and standards became accepted practice in the hospital system of the colony. By the time she returned to England she had laid the foundation of modern nursing in New South Wales.

In 1881 the Infirmary&#x27;s name was changed to the Sydney Hospital. Lucy Osburn left Sydney in 1884 and returned to London. After some years nursing among the sick and poor in London, she died of diabetes at her sister&#x27;s home in Harrogate on 22 December 1891. Lucy Osburn was described by her successor at Sydney Hospital, Miss McKay, as &quot;an exceptional woman&quot; who regarded nursing &quot;as the highest employment&quot; to be entered with &quot;a spirit of devotion&quot;. One of her common recommendations to those taking up the profession was reported as being &quot;you nurses should exist for patients, not they for you&quot;.

==The Nightingale Wing==

Nurse training in Australia began on site in 1868 when Florence Nightingale sent out Lucy Osburn and five other English sisters. The brick and sandstone Gothic Revival Nightingale Wing of 1869 off the central courtyard, with its colourful fountain, was built to house the female staff of the hospital with the input of Florence Nightingale.

==Restoration==
By 1984, restoration of the old Rum Hospital building was complete. Together with its &quot;twin&quot; the former Mint, it remains the oldest building in Macquarie Street and the oldest public building in the City of Sydney. Arguably of all Sydney buildings, none have had a longer or more central influence in the affairs of the state than the North Wing.

==Recent work==
The Sydney Eye Hospital started at Millers Point in 1882 and moved to Woolloomooloo in 1922. It joined the Sydney Hospital campus in 1996.
Recent work includes the construction of an eight level car park, ground floor emergency with eye hospital outpatients, two levels of wards and an operating theatre on the top floor. The new work enabled the demolition of the Travers building, long considered an eyesore, thereby allowing the campus to be opened up to The Domain.

The new Clinical Services building was completed during 1995 to complement the existing architectural style and was officially opened on 30 October 1996.

<doc id="665233" wikidata="Q5247662" url="?curid=665233" title="Deathbed conversion">
<text>A deathbed conversion is the adoption of a particular religious faith shortly before dying. Making a conversion on one&#x27;s deathbed may reflect an immediate change of belief, a desire to formalize longer-term beliefs, or a desire to complete a process of conversion already underway. Claims of the deathbed conversion of famous or influential figures have also been used in history as rhetorical devices.

==Overview==

Conversions at the point of death have a long history. The first recorded deathbed conversion appears in the Gospel of Luke where the good thief, crucified beside Jesus, expresses belief in Christ. Jesus accepts his conversion, saying &quot;Today you shall be with Me in Paradise&quot;.

Perhaps the most momentous conversion in Western history was that of Constantine I, Roman Emperor and later proclaimed a Christian Saint by the Eastern Orthodox Church. While his belief in Christianity occurred long before his death, it was only on his deathbed that he was baptised, in 337 by the Arian bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia, While traditional sources disagree as to why this happened so late, modern historiography concludes that Constantine chose religious tolerance as an instrument to bolster his reign. According to Bart Ehrman, all Christians contemporary to Constantine got baptized on their deathbed since they firmly believed that continuing to sin after baptism would ensure their eternal damnation. Ehrman sees no conflict between Constantine&#x27;s Paganism and him being a Christian.

== Notable deathbed conversions to Catholicism==

===Buffalo Bill===
Buffalo Bill was baptized Catholic one day before his death in 1917.

===Charles II of England===

Charles II of England reigned in an Anglican nation at a time of strong religious conflict. Though his sympathies were at least somewhat with the Roman Catholic faith, he ruled as an Anglican, though he attempted to lessen the persecution and legal penalties affecting non-Anglicans in England, notably through the Royal Declaration of Indulgence. As he lay dying following a stroke, released of the political need, he was received into the Catholic Church.

=== Jean de La Fontaine ===
The most famous French fabulist published a revised edition of his greatest work, &quot;Contes&quot;, in 1692, the same year that he began to suffer a severe illness. Under such circumstances, Jean de La Fontaine turned to religion. A young priest, M. Poucet, tried to persuade him about the impropriety of the &quot;Contes&quot;, and it is said that the destruction of a new play of some merit was demanded and submitted to as a proof of repentance. La Fontaine received the Viaticum, and the following years, he continued to write poems and fables. He died in 1695.

=== Sir Allan Napier MacNab ===
Sir Allan Napier MacNab, Canadian political leader, died 8 August 1862 in Hamilton, Ontario. His deathbed conversion to Catholicism caused a furor in the press in the following days. The &quot;Toronto Globe&quot; and the &quot;Hamilton Spectator&quot; expressed strong doubts about the conversion, and the Anglican rector of Christ Church in Hamilton declared that MacNab died a Protestant. MacNab&#x27;s Catholic baptism is recorded at St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral in Hamilton, performed by John, Bishop of Hamilton, on 7 August 1862. Lending credibility to this conversion, MacNab&#x27;s second wife, who predeceased him, was Catholic, and their two daughters were raised as Catholics.

===Charles Maurras===
In the last days before his death, French author Charles Maurras readopted the Catholic faith of his childhood and received the last rites.

===Oscar Wilde===

Author and wit Oscar Wilde converted to Catholicism during his final illness. Robert Ross gave a clear and unambiguous account: &quot;When I went for the priest to come to his death-bed he was quite conscious and raised his hand in response to questions and satisfied the priest, Father Cuthbert Dunne of the Passionists. It was the morning before he died and for about three hours he understood what was going on (and knew I had come from the South in response to a telegram) that he was given the last sacrament.&quot; The Passionist house in Avenue Hoche, has a house journal which contains a record, written by Dunne, of his having received Wilde into full communion with the Church. While Wilde&#x27;s conversion may have come as a surprise, he had long maintained an interest in the Catholic Church, having met with Pope Pius IX in 1877 and describing the Roman Catholic Church as &quot;for saints and sinners alone – for respectable people, the Anglican Church will do&quot;. However, how much of a believer in all the tenets of Catholicism Wilde ever was is arguable: in particular, against Ross&#x27;s insistence on the truth of Catholicism: &quot;No, Robbie, it isn&#x27;t true.&quot; &quot;My position is curious,&quot; Wilde epigrammatised, &quot;I am not a Catholic: I am simply a violent Papist.&quot;

In his poem &quot;Ballad of Reading Gaol&quot;, Wilde wrote:

===John Wayne===

American actor and filmmaker John Wayne, according to his son Patrick and his grandson Matthew Muñoz, who was a priest in the California Diocese of Orange, converted to Roman Catholicism shortly before his death. Muñoz stated that Wayne expressed a degree of regret about not becoming a Catholic earlier in life, explaining &quot;that was one of the sentiment he expressed before he passed on,&quot; blaming &quot;a busy life.&quot;

==Alleged deathbed conversions==

===Charles Darwin===

One famous example is Charles Darwin&#x27;s deathbed conversion in which it was claimed (in 1915) by Lady Hope that Darwin said:
&quot;How I wish I had not expressed my theory of evolution as I have done.&quot; He went on to say that he would like her to gather a congregation since he &quot;would like to speak to them of Christ Jesus and His salvation, being in a state where he was eagerly savoring the heavenly anticipation of bliss.&quot;
Lady Hope&#x27;s story was printed in the &quot;Boston Watchman Examiner&quot;. The story spread, and the claims were republished as late as October 1955 in the &quot;Reformation Review&quot; and in the &quot;Monthly Record&quot; of the Free Church of Scotland in February 1957.

Lady Hope&#x27;s story is not supported by Darwin&#x27;s children. Darwin&#x27;s son Francis Darwin accused her of lying, saying that &quot;Lady Hope&#x27;s account of my father&#x27;s views on religion is quite untrue. I have publicly accused her of falsehood, but have not seen any reply.&quot; Darwin&#x27;s daughter Henrietta Litchfield also called the story a fabrication, saying &quot;I was present at his deathbed. Lady Hope was not present during his last illness, or any illness. I believe he never even saw her, but in any case she had no influence over him in any department of thought or belief. He never recanted any of his scientific views, either then or earlier. We think the story of his conversion was fabricated in the U.S.A. The whole story has no foundation whatever.&quot;

===Doc Holliday===
According to an obituary by the &quot;Glenwood Springs Ute Chief&quot;&#x27;, Doc Holliday had been baptized in the Catholic Church shortly before he died. This was based on correspondence written between Holliday and his cousin, Sister Mary Melanie Holliday (a Catholic Nun), though no baptismal record has ever been found.

===Edward VII===
King Edward VII of the U.K. is alleged by some to have converted to Roman Catholicism on his deathbed, with other accounts alleging he converted secretly two months before his death.

===Wallace Stevens===
The poet Wallace Stevens is said to have been baptized a Catholic during his last days suffering from stomach cancer. This account is disputed, particularly by Stevens&#x27;s daughter, Holly, and critic, Helen Vendler, who, in a letter to James Wm. Chichetto, thought Fr. Arthur Hanley was &quot;forgetful&quot; since &quot;he was interviewed twenty years after Stevens&#x27; death.&quot;

===Voltaire===
The accounts of Voltaire&#x27;s death have been numerous and varying, and it has not been possible to establish the details of what precisely occurred. His enemies related that he repented and accepted the last rites from a Catholic priest, or that he died in agony of body and soul, while his adherents told of his defiance to his last breath.

===George Washington===
After U.S. President George Washington died in 1799, rumors spread among his slaves that he was baptized Catholic on his deathbed. This story was orally passed down in African-American communities into the 20th Century, as well as among early Maryland Jesuits. The &quot;Denver Register&quot; printed two pieces, in 1952 and 1957, discussing the possibility of this rumor, including the fact that an official inventory of Washington&#x27;s personal belongings at the time of his death included 1 Likeness of Virgin Mary (an item unlikely to have been held by a Protestant). However, no definitive evidence has ever been found of a conversion, nor did any testimony from those close to Washington, including the Catholic Archbishop John Carroll, ever mention this occurring.

<text>Elephas is a genus of elephants and one of two surviving genera in the family Elephantidae, comprising one extant species, the Asian elephant (&quot;E. maximus&quot;). Several extinct species have been identified as belonging to the genus, extending back to the Pliocene or possibly the late Miocene.

== Description ==
Species of &quot;Elephas&quot; have distinct bossing of the parieto-occipital region of the skull. The premaxillae bones containing the tusks are tapered.

== Evolutionary history ==
Relationships of living and extinct elephantids based on DNA, after Palkopoulou et al. 2018.Asian elephants share a closer common ancestry with mammoths (genus &quot;Mammuthus&quot;) than they do with African elephants (&quot;Loxodonta&quot;). The oldest species attributed to the genus &quot;Elephas&quot; is &quot;E. nawataensis&quot; from the Late Miocene-Early Pliocene of Kenya, though the validity of this species and its relationship to &quot;Elephas&quot; has been doubted. The oldest species widely attributed to the genus, &quot;Elephas ekorensis&quot; is known from the early-mid Pliocene (5–4.2 million years ago) of East Africa&quot;,&quot; though the attribution of this species to &quot;Elephas&quot; has been questioned, due to a lack of shared morphological features with later &quot;Elephas&quot; species.&quot;&quot; The oldest record of the genus outside of Africa is &quot;Elephas planifrons&quot; which is known from the Late Pliocene of the Indian subcontinent, around 3.6 million years ago. However, the placement of &quot;Elephas planifrons&quot; within the genus has also been questioned. The earliest fossils of the ancestor of the modern Asian elephant, &quot;Elephas hysudricus&quot; date to the beginning of the Pleistocene, around 2.6 million years ago, with remains found on the Indian subcontinent. Modern Asian elephants had evolved from &quot;E. hysrudicus&quot; by the Late Pleistocene.

==Taxonomy==
The scientific name &quot;Elephas&quot; was proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 who described the genus and an elephant from Ceylon.
The genus is assigned to the proboscidean family Elephantidae and is made up of one living and seven extinct species:
* &quot;Elephas maximus&quot; – Asian elephant
** &quot;Elephas maximus indicus&quot; – Indian elephant
** &quot;Elephas maximus maximus&quot; – Sri Lankan elephant
** &quot;Elephas maximus sumatranus&quot; – Sumatran elephant
** &quot;Elephas maximus borneensis&quot; – Borneo elephant, proposed but not yet recognized as valid
The following Asian elephants were proposed as extinct subspecies, but are now considered synonymous with the Indian elephant:
* &quot;Elephas maximus sondaicus&quot; – Javan elephant †
* &quot;Elephas maximus rubridens&quot; – Chinese elephant †
* &quot;Elephas maximus asurus&quot; – Syrian elephant †

The following &quot;Elephas&quot; species are extinct:
* &quot;Elephas beyeri&quot; – dwarf elephant species described from fossil remains found in 1911 in Luzon, the Philippines by von Königswald
* &quot;Elephas ekorensis&quot; – described from the Kubi Algi Formation, Turkana, Kenya, dating to the Early Pliocene, one of the oldest species of the genus.
* &quot;Elephas hysudricus&quot; – described from fossil remains found in the Siwalik Hills of the northern Indian subcontinent by Falconer and Cautley, 1845, thought to be the ancestor of the living Asian elephant.
* &quot;Elephas hysudrindicus&quot; – a fossil elephant of the Pleistocene of Java and different from &quot;Elephas maximus sondaicus&quot;
* &quot;Elephas planifrons&quot; - one of the oldest species, known from the Late Pliocene-Early Pleistocene of the Indian subcontinent.
* &quot;Elephas platycephalus&quot; a species sometimes recognised from the Pleistocene of India
* &quot;Elephas kiangnanensis&quot; a species sometimes recognised from the Early-Middle Pleistocene of China.
* &quot;Elephas nawataensis&quot; a species of elephant known from the Late Miocene-Early Pliocene of Kenya, though other authors argue that this species is actually a synonym of &quot;Primelephas korotorensis.&quot;
* &quot;Elephas atavus&quot;? known from the Early Pleistocene of Africa, traditionally considered part of &quot;Elephas/Palaeoloxodon recki&quot; 
While formerly assigned to this genus, &quot;Elephas recki&quot;, &quot;Elephas namadicus&quot;, the straight-tusked elephant &quot;E. antiquus&quot; and the dwarf elephants &quot;E. falconeri&quot; and &quot;E. cypriotes&quot; are now placed in the separate genus &quot;Palaeoloxodon,&quot; which is more closely related to African elephants. However, some material historically assigned to &quot;Elephas recki&quot; , such as &quot;Elephas recki atavus,&quot; may be closely related to true &quot;Elephas,&quot; rather than to &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; &quot;&quot;Elephas&quot; celebensis&quot; is now placed in &quot;Stegoloxodon&quot;.

<text>Direct marketing is a form of communicating an offer, where organizations communicate directly to a pre-selected customer and supply a method for a direct response. Among practitioners, it is also known as &quot;direct response marketing&quot;. In contrast to direct marketing, advertising is more of a mass-message nature.
Response channels include toll-free telephone numbers, reply cards, reply forms to be sent in an envelope, websites and email addresses.

The prevalence of direct marketing and the unwelcome nature of some communications has led to regulations and laws such as the CAN-SPAM Act, requiring that consumers in the United States be allowed to opt out.

==Overview==
Intended targets are selected from larger populations based on vendor-defined criteria, including average income for a particular ZIP code, purchasing history and presence on other lists. The goal is &quot;to sell directly to consumers&quot; without letting others &quot;join (the) parade.&quot; 

Compared to general marketing which is not as targeted, direct marketing is targeted to speak directly with the consumer. 

==History==

Direct marketing, using catalogues, was practiced in 15th-century Europe. The publisher Aldus Manutius of Venice printed a catalogue of the books he offered for sale. In 1667, the English gardener, William Lucas, published a seed catalogue, which he mailed to his customers to inform them of his prices. Catalogues spread to colonial America, where Benjamin Franklin is believed to have been the first cataloguer in British America. In 1744, he produced a catalogue of scientific and academic books.

 Meeting the demands of the consumer revolution and the growth in wealth of the middle classes helped drive the Industrial Revolution in Britain. Following the Industrial Revolution of the late 18th-century, a growing middle class created new demand for goods and services. Entrepreneurs, including Matthew Boulton and pottery manufacturer Josiah Wedgwood, pioneered many of the marketing strategies used today, including direct marketing.
The Welsh entrepreneur Pryce Pryce-Jones set up the first modern mail order in 1861. Starting as an apprentice to a local draper in Newtown, Wales, he took over the business in 1856 and renamed it the Royal Welsh Warehouse, selling local Welsh flannel.

Improvements in transportation systems combined with the advent of the Uniform Penny Post in the mid-19th century provided the necessary conditions for rapid growth in mail order services. In 1861, Pryce-Jones hit upon a unique method of selling his wares. He distributed catalogs of his wares across the country, allowing people to choose the items they wished and order them via post. Pryce-Jones would then dispatch the goods to the customer via the railways. It was an ideal way of meeting the needs of customers in isolated rural locations who were either too busy or unable to get into Newtown to shop directly. This was the world&#x27;s first mail-order business, an idea which would change the nature of retail in the coming century.

One of Pryce-Jones&#x27; most popular products was the Euklisia Rug, the forerunner of the modern sleeping bag, which Pryce-Jones exported around the world, at one point landing a contract with the Russian Army for 60,000 rugs. By 1880, he had more than 100,000 customers and his success was rewarded in 1887 with a knighthood.

In the 19th century, the American retailer, Aaron Montgomery Ward, believed that using the technique of selling products directly to the customer at appealing prices could if executed effectively and efficiently, revolutionize the market industry and therefore be used as a model for marketing products and creating customer loyalty. The term &quot;direct marketing&quot; was coined long after Montgomery Ward&#x27;s time. 

In 1872, Ward produced the first mail-order catalog for his Montgomery Ward mail order business. By buying goods and then reselling them directly to customers, Ward was consequently removing the middlemen at the general store and, to the benefit of the customer, drastically lowering the prices. The Direct Mail Advertising Association, the predecessor of the present-day Direct Marketing Association, was first established in 1917. Third class bulk mail postage rates were established in 1928.

In 1967, Lester Wunderman identified, named, and defined the term &quot;direct marketing&quot;. Wunderman—considered to be the father of contemporary direct marketing—is behind the creation of the toll-free 1-800 number and numerous loyalty marketing programs including the Columbia Record Club, the magazine subscription card, and the American Express Customer Rewards program.

==Objectives==
Direct Marketing has a few objectives such as: selling, generating leads, and developing relationships with customers.

Selling is a major objective of direct marketing. An example of this can be newspaper with an advertisement promoting a certain product to buy.

Another objective of direct marketing is to both generate leads and qualify leads. Leads that are qualified can also be identified as prospective customers.

Developing relationships with customers is also an objective of a direct marketing campaign. If a direct marketing campaign is executed correctly, the loyalty ladder shows that a target company can go from suspects to prospects to customers to clients and finally to advocates.

==Challenges and solutions==
List brokers provide names and contact information, but their services need to be contrasted to expected &quot;return on investment.&quot;

Success can vary based on factors such as:
* Offer (best offer may yield up to 3 times the response, as compared with the worst offer)
* Timing (best timing for the campaign may yield up to 2 times the response, as compared with the worst timing)
* Ease of response (best/multiple ways offered to respond may yield up to 1.35 times the response, as compared with not-so-friendly response mechanism/s)
* Creativity 
* Media employed. The medium/media used to deliver a message can have a significant impact on responses. It is difficult to truly personalize a DRTV or radio message. One can even attempt to send a personalized message via email or text message, but a high-quality direct mail envelope and the letter will typically have a better chance of generated a response in this scenario.
* Fulfillment – Mail fulfillment is the physical act of printing and then the postage and distribution of it. And this is an important stage within the Direct Marketing process. This stage is known as direct mail fulfillment – and includes tasks such as data cleansing, material preparation, collation, folding, closing, bundling, packaging and courier collection. This stage is also something that cannot be overlooked as it can truly define the success of a direct marketing campaign.

Some direct marketers use individual &quot;opt-out&quot; lists, variable printing, and better-targeted list practices to improve success percentages. Additionally, in order to avoid unwanted mailings, members of the marketing industry have established preference services that give customers more control over the marketing communications they receive in the mail.

The term &quot;junk mail&quot;, referring to unsolicited commercial ads delivered via post office or directly deposited in consumers&#x27; mail boxes, can be traced back to 1954. The term &quot;spam,&quot; meaning &quot;unsolicited commercial e-mail,&quot; can be traced back to March 31, 1993, although in its first few months it merely referred to inadvertently posting a message so many times on UseNet that the repetitions effectively drowned out the normal flow of conversation.

To address the concerns of unwanted emails or spam, in 2003, The US Congress enacted the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing (CAN-SPAM) Act to curb unwanted email messages. Can-Spam gives recipients the ability to stop unwanted emails and set out tough penalties for violations. Additionally, ISPs and email service providers have developed increasingly effective Email Filtering programs. These filters can interfere with the delivery of email marketing campaigns, even if the person has subscribed to receive them, as legitimate email marketing can possess the same hallmarks as spam. There are a range of email service providers that provide services for legitimate opt-in emailers to avoid being classified as spam.

Consumers have expressed concerns about the privacy and environmental implications of direct marketing. In response to consumer demand and increasing business pressure to increase the effectiveness of reaching the right customer with direct marketing, companies specialize in targeted direct advertising to great effect, reducing advertising budget waste and increasing the effectiveness of delivering a marketing message with better geo-demography information, delivering the advertising message to only the customers interested in the product, service, or event on offer. Additionally, members of the advertising industry have been working to adopt stricter codes regarding online targeted advertising.

==Channels==
There are many channels that are effective for direct marketing such as: direct mail, telephone, newspaper, magazine, television, radio, and use of the internet. 

===Email marketing===
Sending marketing messages through email or email marketing is one of the most widely used direct-marketing methods. One reason for email marketing&#x27;s popularity is that it is relatively inexpensive to design, test, and send an email message. It also allows marketers to deliver messages around the clock and accurately measure responses.

===Online tools===
With the expansion of digital technology and tools, direct marketing is increasingly taking place through online channels. Most online advertising is delivered to a focused group of customers and has a trackable response.
* &quot;Display Ads&quot; are interactive ads that appear on the Web next to content on Web pages or Web services. Formats include static banners, pop-ups, videos, and floating units. Customers can click on the ad to respond directly to the message or to find more detailed information. According to research by eMarketer, Display Advertising, including Social Media display ads, was 45.9% of all ad spending in 2018 and is expected to grow to 60.5% of ad spending by 2023.
* &quot;Search:&quot; 49% of US spending on Internet ads goes to search, in which advertisers pay for prominent placement among listings in search engines whenever a potential customer enters a relevant search term, allowing ads to be delivered to customers based upon their already-indicated search criteria. This paid placement industry generates more than $10 billion for search companies. Marketers also use search engine optimization to drive traffic to their sites.
* &quot;Social Media Sites&quot;, such as Facebook and Twitter, also provide opportunities for direct marketers to communicate directly with customers by creating content to which customers can respond.

===Mobile===
Through mobile marketing, marketers engage with prospective customers and donors in an interactive manner through a mobile device or network, such as a cellphone, smartphone, or tablet. Types of mobile marketing messages include: &quot;SMS&quot; (short message service)—marketing communications are sent in the form of text messages, also known as texting. &quot;MMS&quot; (multi-media message service)—marketing communications are sent in the form of media messages.

In October 2013, the Federal Telephone Consumers Protection Act made it illegal to contact an individual via cell phone without prior express written consent for all telephone calls using an automatic telephone dialing system or a prerecorded voice to deliver a telemarketing message (known as Robocall) to wireless numbers and residential lines. An existing business relationship does not provide an exception to this requirement.

&quot;Mobile Applications:&quot; Smartphone-based mobile apps contain several types of messages. Push Notifications are direct messages sent to a user either automatically or as part of a campaign. They include transactional, marketing, geo-based, and more. Rich Push Notifications are full HTML Push Notifications. Mobile apps also contain Interactive ads that appear inside the mobile application or app; &quot;Location-Based Marketing:&quot; marketing messages delivered directly to a mobile device based on the user&#x27;s location; &quot;QR Codes&quot; (quick-response barcodes): This is a type of 2D barcode with an encoded link that can be accessed from a smartphone. This technology is increasingly being used for everything from special offers to product information. &quot;Mobile Banner Ads:&quot; Like standard banner ads for desktop Web pages but smaller to fit on mobile screens and run on the mobile content network

===Telemarketing===
Another common form of direct marketing is telemarketing, in which marketers contact customers by phone. The primary benefit to businesses is increased lead generation, which helps businesses increase sales volume and customer base. The most successful telemarketing service providers focus on generating more &quot;qualified&quot; leads that have a higher probability of getting converted into actual sales.

In the United States, the National Do Not Call Registry was created in 2003 to offer consumers a choice of whether to receive telemarketing calls at home. The FTC created the National Do Not Call Registry after a comprehensive review of the Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR). The do-not-call provisions of the TSR cover any plan, program, or campaign to sell goods or services through interstate phone calls.

The 2012 modification, which went into effect on October 16, 2013, stated that prior express written consent will be required for all auto dialed and/or pre-recorded calls/texts sent/made to cell phone; and for pre-recorded calls made to residential land lines for marketing purposes.

Further, a consumer who does not wish to receive further prerecorded telemarketing calls can &quot;opt-out&quot; of receiving such calls by dialing a telephone number (required to be provided in the prerecorded message) to register his or her do-not-call request. The provisions do not cover calls from political organizations or charities.

Canada has its own National Do Not Call List (DNCL). In other countries, it is voluntary, such as the New Zealand Name Removal Service.

====Voicemail marketing====
Voicemail marketing emerged from the market prevalence of personal voice mailboxes, and business voicemail systems. One particular form is known as Ringless voicemail. Voice-mail courier is a similar form of voice-mail marketing with both business-to-business and business-to-consumer applications.

===Broadcast faxing===
Broadcast faxing, in which faxes are sent to multiple recipients, is now less common than in the past. This is partly due to laws in the United States and elsewhere which regulate its use for consumer marketing. In 2005, President Bush signed into law S.714, the Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005 (JFPA), which allows marketers to send commercial faxes to those with whom they have an established business relationship (EBR), but imposes some new requirements. These requirements include providing an opt-out notice on the first page of faxes and establishing a system to accept opt-outs at any time of the day. Roughly 2% of direct marketers use faxes for advertising purposes, mostly for business-to-business marketing campaigns.

===Couponing===
Couponing is used in print and digital media to elicit a response from the reader. An example is a coupon which the reader receives through the mail and takes to a store&#x27;s check-out counter to receive a discount.

&quot;Digital Coupons:&quot; Manufacturers and retailers make coupons available online for electronic orders that can be downloaded and printed. Digital coupons are available on company websites, social media outlets, texts, and email alerts. There are an increasing number of mobile phone applications offering digital coupons for direct use.

Daily Deal Sites offer local and online deals each day, and are becoming increasingly popular. Customers sign up to receive notice of discounts and offers, which are sent daily by email. Purchases are often made using a special coupon code or promotional code. The largest of these sites, Groupon, has over 83 million subscribers.

===Direct response marketing=== 
Direct Response Marketing is designed to generate an immediate response from consumers, where each consumer response (and purchase) can be measured, and attributed to individual advertisements. This form of marketing is differentiated from other marketing approaches, primarily because there are no intermediaries such as retailers between the buyer and seller, and therefore the buyer must contact the seller directly to purchase products or services. Direct-response marketing is delivered through a wide variety of media, including DRTV, radio, mail, print advertising, telemarketing, catalogues, and the Internet.

====Direct response mail order====
Mail order in which customers respond by mailing a completed order form to the marketer. Mail order direct response has become more successful in recent years due to internet exposure.

====Direct response television====

Direct marketing via television (commonly referred to as DRTV) has two basic forms: long form (usually half-hour or hour-long segments that explain a product in detail and are commonly referred to as infomercials) and short form, which refers to typical 30-second or 60-second commercials that ask viewers for an immediate response (typically to call a phone number on screen or go to a website). TV-response marketing—i.e. infomercials—can be considered a form of direct marketing, since responses are in the form of calls to telephone numbers given on-air. This allows marketers to reasonably conclude that the calls are due to a particular campaign, and enables them to obtain customers&#x27; phone numbers as targets for telemarketing. One of the most famous DRTV commercials was for Ginsu Knives by Ginsu Products, Inc. of Rhode Island. Several aspects of ad, such as its use of adding items to the offer and the guarantee of satisfaction were much copied, and came to be considered part of the formula for success with short-form direct-response TV ads (DRTV).

Forms of direct response marketing on television include standard short form television commercials, infomercials and home shopping networks. Short-form direct-response commercials have time lengths ranging from 30 seconds to 2 minutes. Long form infomercials are typically 30 minutes long. An offshoot of the infomercial is the home shopping industry. In this medium, items can potentially be offered with reduced overhead.

====Direct response radio====
In direct response radio, ads contain a call to action with a specific tracking mechanism. Often, this tracking mechanism is a &quot;call now&quot; prompt with a toll-free phone number or a unique Web URL. Results of the ad can be tracked in terms of calls, orders, customers, leads, sales, revenue, and profits that result from the airing of those ads.

====Direct response magazines and newspapers====
Magazine and newspaper ads often include a direct response call-to-action, such as a toll-free number, a coupon redeemable at a brick-and-mortar store, or a QR code that can be scanned by a mobile device—these methods are all forms of direct marketing, because they elicit a direct and measurable action from the customer.

By 1982, &quot;the rising cost of an industrial sales call&quot; (compared to 1971) led to business press outlets becoming a &quot;primary reference for buying.&quot;

====Other direct response media====
Other media, such as magazines, newspapers, radio, social media, search engine marketing and e-mail can be used to elicit the response. A survey of large corporations found e-mail to be one of the most effective forms of direct response.

===Direct mail===


The term &quot;advertising&quot;, or &quot;direct mail&quot;, is used to refer to communications sent to potential customers or donors via the postal service and other delivery services. Direct mail is sent to customers based on criteria such as age, income, location, profession, buying pattern, etc. Direct mail includes advertising circulars, catalogs, free-trial CDs, pre-approved credit card applications, and other unsolicited merchandising invitations delivered by mail to homes and businesses. Bulk mailings are a particularly popular method of promotion for businesses operating in the financial services, home computer, and travel and tourism industries.

In many developed countries, direct mail represents such a significant amount of the total volume of mail that special rate classes have been established. In the United States and United Kingdom, for example, there are bulk mail rates that enable marketers to send mail at rates that are substantially lower than regular first-class rates. In order to qualify for these rates, marketers must format and sort the mail in particular ways—which reduces the handling (and therefore costs) required by the postal service. In the US, marketers send over 90 billion pieces of direct mail per year.

Advertisers often refine direct mail practices into targeted mailing, in which mail is sent out following database analysis to select recipients considered most likely to respond positively. For example, a person who has demonstrated an interest in golf may receive direct mail for golf-related products or perhaps for goods and services that are appropriate for golfers. This use of database analysis is a type of database marketing. The United States Postal Service calls this form of mail &quot;advertising mail&quot; (admail for short).

In 1983, 15.1% of US postal revenue came from direct mail.

===Insert media===
Insert media is another form of direct marketing, where marketing materials are inserted into other communications, such as a catalog, newspaper, magazine, package, or bill. Coop or shared mail, where marketing offers from several companies are delivered via a single envelope, is also considered insert media.

===Out-of-home===
Out-of-home direct marketing refers to a wide array of media designed to reach the consumer outside the home, including billboards, transit, bus shelters, bus benches, aerials, airports, in-flight, in-store, movies, college campus/high schools, hotels, shopping malls, sport facilities, stadiums, taxis—that contain a call-to-action for the customer to respond.

===Direct selling===
Direct selling is the sale of products by face-to-face contact with the customer, either by having salespeople approach potential customers in person, or through indirect means such as Tupperware parties.

===Grassroots/community marketing===
Grassroots marketing involves advertising in the local community. The goal is to involve the community in discussions about the business through local events, meetings, and projects.

==Ethical conduct==
The ICC Consolidated Code of Advertising and Marketing relates to all direct marketing activities in their entirety, whatever their form, medium or content. It sets the standards of ethical conduct to be followed by marketers, practitioners or other contractors providing services for direct marketing purposes or in the media.

===The offer===
The fulfillment of any obligation arising from a direct marketing activity should be prompt and efficient.

Whenever an offer is made, all the commitments to be fulfilled by the marketer, the operator and the consumer should be made clear to consumers, either directly or by reference to sales conditions available to them at the time of the offer.

===Presentation===
When the presentation of an offer also features products not included in the offer, or where additional products need to be purchased to enable the consumer to use the product on offer, this should be made clear in the original offer.

High-pressure tactics which might be construed as harassment should be avoided, and, marketers should ensure that they respect local culture and tradition to avoid offensive questions.

===Right of withdrawal===
Where consumers have a right of withdrawal (the consumer&#x27;s right to resend any goods to the seller, or to cancel the order for services, within a certain time limit and thus annulling the sale), the marketer should inform them of the existence of this right, how to obtain further information about it, and how to exercise it. Where there is an offer to supply products to the consumer on the basis of &quot;free examination&quot;, &quot;free trial&quot;, &quot;free approval&quot; and the like, it should be made clear in the offer who will bear the cost of returning products and the procedure for returning them should be as simple as possible. Any time limit for the return should be clearly disclosed.

===Identity of the marketer===
The identity of the marketer and/or operator and details of where and how they may be contacted should be given in the offer, so as to enable the consumer to communicate directly and effectively with them.
This information should be available as a permanent reference which the consumer can keep, i.e. via a separate document offline, an online document, email or SMS; it should not, for example, appear only on an order form which the consumer is required to return. At the time of delivery of the product, the marketer&#x27;s full name, address and telephone number should be supplied to the consumer.

===Respecting consumer wishes===
Where consumers have indicated the wish not to receive direct marketing communications by signing on to a preference service, or in any other way, this should be respected. Marketers who are communicating with consumers internationally should, where possible, ensure that they avail themselves of the appropriate preference service in the markets to which they are addressing their communications and respect consumers&#x27; wishes not to receive such communications (see also General Provisions, article 19, data protection and privacy). Where a system exists, enabling consumers to indicate a wish not to receive unaddressed mail (e.g. mailbox stickers), this should be respected.

===Responsibility===
Overall responsibility for all aspects of direct marketing activities, whatever their kind or content, rests with the marketer. However, responsibility also applies to other participants in direct marketing activities and that needs to be taken into account. As well as marketers, these may include: operators, telemarketers or data controllers, or their subcontractors, who contribute to the activity or communication; publishers, media-owners or contractors who publish, transmit or distribute the offer or any other communication.

<text>Argus Motoren was a German manufacturing firm known for their series of small inverted-V engines and the Argus As 014 pulsejet for the V-1 flying bomb.

==History==
Started in Berlin in 1906 as a subsidiary of Henri Jeannin&#x27;s automobile business, &quot;Argus Motoren&quot; company spun off entirely in November 1906.
Their early products were car and boat engines, but later that year they were contracted to produce engines for the French airship, &quot;Ville de Paris&quot;, supplying them with a converted boat motor. They turned increasingly to the aviation market, and were widely used by 1910, receiving an order from Sikorsky for one of his large airplanes under construction in Russia. During World War I Argus produced engines for the German army and air corps.

After World War I the company manufactured automobile engines and acquired a majority interest in Horch Automobile in 1919. In 1926 they resumed aircraft engine design, producing a series of inverted inline and V engines. Although all were at the &quot;low-power&quot; end of the market by the start of World War II, they saw extensive use in training aircraft and other utility roles. Most famous of these designs are the Argus As 10, used in the Fieseler Fi 156 &quot;Storch&quot;, in the Arado Ar 66 and in the Focke-Wulf Fw 56 &quot;Stösser&quot;; and the Argus As 410, used on many German trainers, including the Arado Ar 96 and the Focke-Wulf Fw 189.

Argus provided also disc brakes, patented by Hermann Klaue (1912-2001), for the Arado Ar 96 landing gear and the Tiger I tank drive train.
The Berlin-Reinickendorf subcamp of Sachsenhausen concentration camp provided labor for the Argus-Werke.

<text>Lash were an all-female alternative/punk rock band from Perth, Western Australia. The members Belinda-Lee Reid (vocals, guitar), Jaclyn Pearson (drums), Jessicca Bennett (lead guitar) and Micaela Slayford (vocals, bass) who all met at the Catholic Santa Maria College. The group released one studio album, &quot;The Beautiful and the Damned&quot; in 2002.

==History==
===1996–2003: Exteria and Lash===
After being together for a few weeks, the girls, named Exteria, entered the song &quot;Aloha Mr Hand&quot; into the Open Youth Category for the under-18s WAM Song of the Year in the 1996 West Australian Music Industry Awards. Exteria won the $1,000 prize, and came to the attention of manager Andrew Klippel.

In 2001, they renamed themselves Lash and signed to Festival Mushroom Records. Lash released their debut single &quot;Take Me Away&quot; in March 2001 and peaked at number 33 on the ARIA Charts. &quot;Beauty Queen&quot; was released in August 2001 and peaked at number 31 on the ARIA Charts. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2001, &quot;Take Me Away&quot; was nominated for ARIA Award for Breakthrough Artist – Single.

Lash won Best New Australian Artist on Commercial Radio at the Commercial Radio Australia Awards of 2001.

Throughout 2002, Lash toured with Eskimo Joe, The Living End, Motor Ace and Ash. &quot;Don&#x27;t Ever Make My Mind Up&quot; was released in February 2002, which was followed by their debut album &quot;The Beautiful and the Damned&quot;, which was released in April 2002 and peaked at number 74 on the ARIA Charts. In 2002, Lash represented Australia at the Golden Stag Festival in Romania.

Their song &quot;Beauty Queen&quot; was also featured in the 2003 film &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan, as well as the film&#x27;s soundtrack. &quot;Take Me Away&quot; was also included, covered by Christina Vidal, as performed by Lohan character&#x27;s band in the film.

The group disbanded in 2003.

===2004–present: post-Lash===
Belinda-Lee Reid: After the break-up of Lash, Reid has pursued a solo career. She was the subject of an episode of the documentary TV program &quot;The Hit Game&quot;, which aired in Australia on ABCTV on 4 October 2005, and showed her recording demos with Palmer, assisted by Pearson and Bennett. In this show, she lamented the stigma attached to her by music industry leaders for being in a &#x27;failed&#x27; act.

Reid&#x27;s debut solo extended play &quot;The Road from Lillyfield&quot; was touted for release in 2005 but never emerged. In 2006, Reid formed a new band called The Silver Scene and released a self-titled extended play for free download on Triple J Unearthed&#x27;s website. By 2014, Reid was working as a real estate agent.

Jessicca Bennett and Jaclyn Pearson: After the break-up of Lash, Bennett and Pearson were part of group The Preytells from 2004 to 2009. They won the National Campus Band Competition in 2005.

Pearson is a microbiologist at the Hudson Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne. She has 3 children.

Since 2016, Bennett has run Love Shack Studios in Footscray, Victoria.

<doc id="665243" wikidata="Q962024" url="?curid=665243" title="Johnny Sheffield">
<text>Johnny Sheffield (born John Matthew Sheffield Cassan, April 11, 1931 – October 15, 2010) was an American child actor who, between 1939 and 1947, portrayed Boy in the Tarzan film series and, between 1949 and 1955, played Bomba, the Jungle Boy.

==Early life==
Sheffield was born John Matthew Sheffield Cassan on April 11, 1931, in Pasadena, California, the second child of English-American actor Reginald Sheffield and Louise Van Loon. His older sister was Mary Alice Sheffield Cassan and his younger brother was William Hart Sheffield Cassan (actor Billy Sheffield). His father was himself a former juvenile performer when he came to the United States from his native England. His mother, a native of New York City, was a Vassar College graduate with a liberal arts education who loved books and lectured widely. 

In 1938, Sheffield became a child star after he was cast in the juvenile lead of a West Coast production of the highly successful Broadway play &quot;On Borrowed Time&quot;, which starred Dudley Digges and featured Victor Moore as Gramps. Sheffield played the role of Pud. He later went to New York as a replacement and performed the role on Broadway.

==&quot;Tarzan&quot; and other films==
The following year, his father read an article in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; that asked, &quot;Have you a Tarzan Jr. in your backyard?&quot; He believed he did and set up an interview. MGM was searching for a suitable youngster to play the adopted son of Tarzan in its next jungle movie with stars Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan. When he was 7 years old, Sheffield was taken to an audition where Weissmuller chose him over more than 300 juvenile actors interviewed for the part of &quot;Boy&quot; in &quot;Tarzan Finds a Son!&quot; (1939). Newspaper articles at the time mentioned erroneously that Sheffield was only 5 years old. In that same year, Sheffield appeared in the Busby Berkeley movie musical &quot;Babes in Arms&quot; with Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland, classmates of his at the studio school.

He appeared with many other performers over the years, including Jeanette MacDonald, Pat O&#x27;Brien, Cesar Romero, Ronald Reagan and Beverly Garland. He played the childhood version of the title character in &quot;Knute Rockne, All American&quot;, perhaps the most prestigious film in which he had a role.

Sheffield played Boy in three Tarzan movies at MGM, and in another five after the star, Weissmuller, and production of the movie series moved to RKO. Brenda Joyce played Jane in the last three Tarzan movies in which Sheffield appeared.

==Bomba and Bantu==
After he outgrew the role of Boy, the teenaged Sheffield went on to star in his own jungle movie series for Allied Artists. The first entry in this series, &quot;Bomba, the Jungle Boy&quot; was released in 1949 with co-star Peggy Ann Garner. In all, he appeared as Bomba 12 times, more than any other character he portrayed. Sheffield retired from films at age 24 after starring in his twelfth Bomba film in 1955 (&quot;Lord of the Jungle&quot;).

He then made a pilot for a television series, &quot;Bantu, the Zebra Boy&quot;, which was created, produced, and directed by his father, Reginald Sheffield. Although the production values were high compared to other TV jungle shows of the day, a sponsor was not found and the show was not taken up as a weekly series. In his later years, Sheffield sold bootlegged copies of the pilot to collectors on videotape.

==Post-Hollywood careers==
Sheffield decided to leave the industry and enrolled in college to further his education. He lived and worked for a time in Arizona. He married Patricia Sheffield in 1959 in Yuma, Arizona. The couple had three children: Patrick, Stewart, and Regina.

After leaving show business, Sheffield completed a business degree at UCLA. Turning his attention to other fields, he involved himself variously in farming, real estate and construction. For a time, he was a representative for the Santa Monica Seafood Company importing lobsters from Baja California in Mexico.

In his later years Johnny Sheffield lived in Southern California where he wrote articles about his Hollywood years and sold copies of the TV pilot &quot;Bantu, the Zebra Boy&quot; on video.

==Death==
Sheffield&#x27;s wife, Patty, said that he fell from a ladder while pruning a palm tree. Though his injuries seemed minor, he died of a heart attack four hours later on October 15, 2010, in Chula Vista, California, aged 79.

<text>Harold de Vance Land (December 18, 1928 – July 27, 2001) was an American hard bop and post-bop tenor saxophonist. Land developed his hard bop playing with the Max Roach/Clifford Brown band into a personal, modern style, often rivalling Clifford Brown&#x27;s instrumental ability with his own inventive and whimsical solos. His tone was strong and emotional, yet hinted at a certain introspective fragility.

==Biography==
Land was born in Houston, Texas, United States and grew up in San Diego, California. He started playing at the age of 16. He made his first recording as the leader of the Harold Land All-Stars, for Savoy Records in 1949. In 1954, he joined the Clifford Brown/Max Roach Quintet, with whom he was at the forefront of the hard-bop/bebop movement. The Land family moved from San Diego to Los Angeles, in 1955. There he played with Curtis Counce, led his own groups, and co-led groups with Bobby Hutcherson, Blue Mitchell, and Red Mitchell. From the 1970s onwards, his style showed the influence of John Coltrane.

In the early 1980s through to the early 1990s he worked regularly with the Timeless All Stars, a group sponsored by the Timeless jazz record label. The group consisted of Land on tenor, Cedar Walton on piano, Buster Williams on bass, Billy Higgins on drums, Curtis Fuller on trombone and Bobby Hutcherson on vibes. Land also toured with his own band during this time, often including his son, Harold Land Jr., on piano and usually featuring Bobby Hutcherson and Billy Higgins as well. During these years he played regularly at Hop Singh&#x27;s in Marina Del Rey in the L.A. area and the Keystone Korner in San Francisco.

Land was a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. He joined the UCLA Jazz Studies Program as a lecturer in 1996 to teach instrumental jazz combo. &quot;Harold Land was one of the major contributors in the history of the jazz saxophone,&quot; said jazz guitarist Kenny Burrell, founder and director of the UCLA Jazz Studies Program.

Land died in July 2001, from a stroke, at the age of 72.

The progressive rock band Yes included a song &quot;Harold Land&quot; on their eponymous debut album in 1969. In a news/blog post on 20 September 2010, Bill Bruford commented about the song - &quot;Harold Land was a hard-bop tenor saxophone player, dead now, but quite why we named a song after him I can&#x27;t remember.&quot;

==Playing style==
Land had an inimitably dark tone within the hard-bop and modal jazz paradigms. Over time this would contrast more and more with the brighter tonalities of more Coltrane-influenced saxophonists, although Land started to implement Coltrane&#x27;s musical innovations. Land&#x27;s &quot;dire, brooding [tenor saxophone] sound began somewhere between rhythm and blues and Coleman Hawkins, and after the early 1960s owed more and more to John Coltrane&#x27;s harmonies, phrasing and experiments with modalism.&quot;

<doc id="665256" wikidata="Q1124733" url="?curid=665256" title="Take">
<text>A take is a single continuous recorded performance. The term is used in film and music to denote and track the stages of production. 

==Film==
In cinematography, a take refers to each filmed &quot;version&quot; of a particular shot or &quot;setup&quot;. Takes of each shot are generally numbered starting with &quot;take one&quot; and the number of each successive take is increased (with the director calling for &quot;take two&quot; or &quot;take eighteen&quot;) until the filming of the shot is completed.

Film takes are often designated with the aid of a clapperboard. It is also referred to as the slate. The number of each take is written or attached to the clapperboard, which is filmed briefly prior to or at the beginning of the actual take. 

Only those takes which are vetted by the continuity person and/or script supervisor are printed and are sent to the film editor.

===Single-takes===
A single-take or one-take occurs when the entire scene is shot satisfactorily the first time, whether by necessity (as with certain expensive special effects) or by some combination of luck and skill.

===Long takes===

Some film directors are known for using very long, unedited takes. Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Rope&quot; is famous for being composed of nine uninterrupted takes, each from four to ten minutes long. This required actors to step over cables and dolly tracks while filming, and stagehands to move furniture and props out of the camera&#x27;s way as it moved around the room. The eight-minute opening shot of &quot;The Player&quot; includes people discussing long takes in other movies.

Aleksandr Sokurov&#x27;s &quot;Russian Ark&quot; (2002) consists of a single 90-minute take, shot on a digital format. Mike Figgis&#x27; &quot;Timecode&quot; (2000) consists of a single 90-minute take as well, albeit with four camera units shooting simultaneously. In the finished film, all four camera angles are shown simultaneously on a split screen, with the sound fading from one to another to direct audience attention.

===Multiple takes===
Other directors such as Stanley Kubrick are notorious for demanding numerous retakes of a single scene, once asking Shelley Duvall to repeat a scene 127 times for &quot;The Shining&quot;. During the shooting of &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;, Kubrick asked for 97 takes of Tom Cruise walking through a door before he was satisfied. Charlie Chaplin, both director and star of &quot;The Gold Rush&quot;, did 63 separate takes of a scene where his character eats a boot—in reality, a prop made of licorice—and ended up being taken to the hospital for insulin shock due to the high sugar intake. Chaplin also did 342 takes of a scene in &quot;City Lights&quot; (1931).

In other cases, it is the actors who cause multiple takes. One fight scene in Jackie Chan&#x27;s &quot;The Young Master&quot; was so intricate that it required 329 takes to complete.

Director Bryan Singer tried for a full day to get his desired shots of the cast of &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; behaving sullenly in a police lineup, but the actors could not remain serious and kept spoiling the takes by laughing and making faces. In the end, Singer changed his plan and used the funniest of the takes in the final movie to illustrate the contempt the criminals had for the police. 

During the filming of &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;, director Billy Wilder was notoriously frustrated by the retakes required by Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s inability to remember her lines.

==Music recording==
In music recording, a take similarly refers to successive attempts to record a song or part. Musical takes are also sequentially numbered. The need to obtain a complete, acceptable take was especially important in the years predating multi-track recording and overdubbing techniques.

Failed attempts are called &quot;false starts&quot; if, for example, not even a complete chorus or verse is recorded; longer almost-complete attempts are called &quot;long false starts&quot;.

Different versions of the same song from a single recording session are sometimes eventually released as alternate takes (or alternative takes) or &quot;playback masters&quot; of the recording. Notable examples of releases of alternate takes include The Beatles &quot;Anthology&quot; box set, Johnny Cash&#x27;s Bear Family box sets and &quot;Johnny Cash:The Outtakes&quot; and a series of alternate takes of recordings by Elvis Presley released by RCA Victor beginning in 1974 with &quot;&quot;.

A fine example of the musical implications of multiple recorded performances and how they differ can be found on the posthumous 1969 LP compilation &quot;To Know a Man&quot; (Blue Horizon 7-66230) which comprises the complete last two early 1960s sessions by legendary slide guitarist Elmore James with backing musicians. These are unedited studio tapes which include multiple live complete and part takes of several tracks. There are also adlib band reminiscences and talkback chat with the producer which give a superb insight into the creative energy of the performing and recording process.

<text>The Heimwehr (, ) or Heimatschutz (, ) was a nationalist, initially paramilitary group that operated in the First Austrian Republic from 1920 to 1936. It was similar in methods, organization, and ideology to the Freikorps in Germany. The Heimwehr was opposed to parliamentary democracy, socialism and Marxism and fought in various skirmishes against left-wing and foreign groups during the 1920s and 1930s. Some of its regional groups also opposed Nazism while others favored it. In spite of its anti-democratic stance, the Heimwehr developed a political wing called the Heimatblock (&#x27;Homeland Bloc&#x27;) that was close to the conservative Christian Social Party and took part in both the cabinet of Chancellor Carl Vaugoin in 1930 and in Engelbert Dollfuss&#x27; right-wing government from 1932 to 1934. In 1936 the Heimwehr was absorbed into what was at the time the only legally permitted political party in Austria, the Fatherland Front, and then later into the , an amalgamation of militia units that in 1937 became part of Austria&#x27;s armed forces.

== Origins ==
After the end of World War I and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, local residents&#x27; militias and self-defense associations formed mainly from demobilized soldiers sprang up across Austria. Their purpose initially was to protect the local population from dangers such as those posed by soldiers trying to make their way to their home countries who, driven by hunger and largely without leadership, sometimes looted and assaulted the population in the areas they passed through. Such local self-defense associations over time formed individual Heimwehr units.

Beginning in April 1919, the Vorarlberg provincial government approved and promoted active paramilitary people&#x27;s militias to combat Austromarxism, either equipping the militia members with weapons or allowing them to use their own. They were led by the Christian Socialist provincial governor Otto Ender and financed primarily by local industry. In the summer of 1920 they had about 3,000 members, whereas the Austrian army in the province had only 800 soldiers under arms. The Vorarlberg Heimwehr subsequently emerged from the militia groups.

The first association of the (&#x27;Homeland Guard&#x27;), as the Heimwehr was called in Tyrol, was founded on 12 May 1920 by Richard Steidle, a member of the Tyrolean parliament from the Christian Social Party who was the regional leader of the in Tyrol until 1936. His deputies either supported or held parliamentary seats with the Greater German People&#x27;s Party (), an Austrian political party calling for unification with Germany. The group&#x27;s statutes listed four program points:
* protection of the constitution and defense against any attempt to change the constitution by force
* protection of persons, employment and property
* support of the existing state authority in maintaining peace and order
* intervention in the case of fundamentally important events
Their program also emphasized the &quot;exclusion of all party politics&quot; and stated that as a private association, it was &quot;not concerned with military matters&quot;. The was thus not a party organization but an independent, politically right-wing paramilitary unit. It saw its political enemy in the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party of Austria, or SDAP (the name that was used by the Social Democratic Party of Austria before 1945).

The Heimwehr was involved early on in border disputes with troops from the Kingdom of Hungary and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. When it turned its opposition primarily against Austromarxism, from which it wished to protect the middle class, the Social Democrats in response formed the &quot;Republikanischer Schutzbund&quot; (&#x27;Republican Protection League&#x27;) in 1923 as a defensive counterweight to the Heimwehr.

The Heimwehr registered significant gains after the SDAP published its militant Linz Program in November 1926. Because it used the language of Marxism and class conflict to provide the theoretical basis for political confrontation with the Christian Social Party and the Heimwehr, it caused many in the middle class, including some who were merely not socialist minded, to fear a domestic political turn toward a dictatorship of the proletariat.

== Years of rapid growth 1927–1930 ==

On 30 January 1927 members of the SDAP who were holding a meeting at Schattendorf in Burgenland were fired on by a group from the right-wing Front Fighters Association of German Austria (), leaving two dead and five wounded. When the men who had been accused of the deaths were acquitted by a jury, protestors in what came to be known as the July Revolt of 1927 burned the Vienna Palace of Justice. More than 80 demonstrators died in the subsequent clashes with the police, leading the Social Democrats to speak of it as the &quot;July Massacre&quot; of workers. When they engaged in transportation strikes, the Heimwehr stepped in to break them, especially in areas outside Vienna.

In the years from 1927 to 1930, the Heimwehr movement experienced a period of rapid growth and became a significant part in the increasingly radicalized domestic political situation&quot;.&quot; It aspired to be more than what Richard Steidle called a watchdog let off its leash when needed by the middle-class parties. Many Heimwehr leaders began to develop a more political profile and demanded a fundamental change in Austria&#x27;s political system that would move it towards authoritarianism and corporatism – that is, a society similar to the type favoured by Italian fascism that was organized around corporate groups such as agriculture, manual labour, the military, business, trade and the like. In 1927 the various provincial Heimwehr associations joined to form an umbrella organization, the Federation of Austrian Self-Defense Associations. The Heimwehr&#x27;s leaders attempted to implement the political change they wanted both through ongoing agitation in the streets – mainly in the form of massive Sunday marches – and behind the scenes through political pressure on the federal government. A large march on 7 October 1928 in Wiener Neustadt, an industrial area of Vienna that was a stronghold of the SDAP, was a self-confident demonstration of strength. Many in the middle class cheered the Heimwehr as a &quot;saviour in the time of need&quot;.
The Heimwehr was supported financially, logistically, and with arms by industry and large landowners, especially from Styria, as well as by Italian fascists, the Hungarian regime of Miklós Horthy and groups on the Bavarian right (e.g. the Organization Chancellor). Numerous World War I front-line officers served as military &quot;advisors&quot; and functionaries. Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg, who became the Heimwehr&#x27;s national leader in 1930, approached right-wing circles in Great Britain, including the fascist politician Oswald Mosley, from whom he was able to receive no financial support. Konstantin Kammerhofer, leader of the Styrian Heimwehr, received money from the German Reich government until mid-1932. When the Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini came to believe that the Heimwehr would not achieve its goal of making Austria fascist, he stopped his financial contributions in October 1933.

== Inability to unify ==

In 1929 the government of Chancellor Ernst Streeruwitz, a coalition of the Christian Social Party, Greater German People&#x27;s Party and the agrarian Landbund, engaged the Heimwehr in negotiations regarding constitutional reform. They and the Social Democrats were close to a compromise when in late September, the Heimwehr and Christian Social Party brought down the government. Ignaz Seipel, leader of the Christian Socialists, chose to install the independent Johannes Schober as chancellor. Schober, who had been Vienna&#x27;s police chief during the 1927 July Revolt and had approved firing on the demonstrators, was seen by the Heimwehr as strong and a beacon of hope. He proved, however, to be a bitter disappointment to them. In the dispute over the 1929 amendment to the Austrian constitution that strengthened the position of the federal president, he worked out a compromise with the Social Democrats that was completely unacceptable to the Heimwehr, and in addition he was unwilling to give in to their other demands. It represented a significant setback for the movement, which until then had seen itself moving in a steadily upward arc.

The Heimwehr&#x27;s failure in the constitutional dispute and the onset of the world economic crisis in Austria in the early 1930s ushered in a period of stagnation and increasing drifting apart within the Heimwehr movement. Its national leader Richard Steidle hoped to overcome the problems in May 1930 with the so-called Korneuburg Oath, which he read out at a general assembly of the Lower Austrian . It included statements that pointed in the direction of Austrofascism such as &quot;We want to seize power … and bring a new order to the state and the economy&quot; and &quot;We reject Western democratic parliamentarianism and the party-state!&quot;. The oath established Austrian conservative nationalism – as distinct from the pan-German nationalism of the Nazi Party – as a basic part of its ideology.

Such attempts to unite the Heimwehr under an integrated leadership failed in the long run due to the differing objectives of the individual Heimwehr associations and the rivalries of their various leaders. The Styrian and Carinthian Heimwehr in particular rejected the Christian, corporatist course of the federal leadership and moved increasingly close to the Nazis. They were also openly anti-Semitic, calling for a boycott of Jewish businesses and banning Jews as members after 1933. The attitude of the rest of the Heimwehr was less definite. Although anti-Semitism was brought into play as a political weapon, as it was against refugees from eastern Europe and the allegedly &quot;Jewish&quot; social democracy, its use was more opportunistic than ideological and did not play a dominant role as an integrative element of the movement.

== Heimatblock ==

After Schober&#x27;s resignation on 25 September 1930, the new Christian Socialist Chancellor Carl Vaugoin offered the Heimwehr a share in his minority cabinet. Although the national leadership of the Heimwehr at first rejected the offer, it was forced to agree under pressure from provincial functionaries. On 1 October 1930, Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg, the Heimwehr&#x27;s newly elected national leader, became Minister of the Interior and Franz Hueber Minister of Justice in Vaugoin&#x27;s cabinet. Vaugoin hoped that this would lead to an alliance with the Heimwehr in the next election.

The Heimwehr&#x27;s national leadership contemplated the electoral alliance and one with the Greater German People&#x27;s Party, the Landbund and the Austrian National Socialists. There was considerable disagreement over questions of ideology and political strategy. Starhemberg advocated a separate Heimwehr list for the 1930 National Council election, while the Styrian Heimwehr rejected the idea. Walter Pfrimer, leader of the Heimwehr in Styria, was fundamentally opposed to participating in the election, while his chief of staff, Rauter, pursued the idea of an electoral alliance with the National Socialists. Rauter met with the German Nazi Party&#x27;s organizational leader, Gregor Strasser, to discuss cooperation in early October 1930. Because there were not enough supporters for such an alliance in the movement, they drew up their own electoral list, the Heimatblock.

=== 1930 election ===
Since the National Council elections were scheduled for 9 November 1930, there was very little time for preparation. The election campaign was characterized by considerable confusion. The Viennese, Lower Austrian, and Burgenland provincial associations preferred to stand in combination with the Christian Socialists, while the Vorarlberg provincial association abstained from any political participation in accordance with its statutes. Some Heimwehr newspapers had to advertise for two lists. In a very short time, the Heimatblock, with generous financial support from the fascist Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, had to improvise the management for the election campaign, develop a party program and schedule election events. Their unexpected participation in the party process, which had previously been so extensively criticized, also had to be explained to members and made palatable to them.

The Heimatblock received 6.2% of the total vote and 8 seats. Entry into the National Council was made possible by the achievement of a &#x27;basic mandate&#x27; in Upper Styria – that is, they attained a sufficient minimum percent of the votes in a region to qualify for entry into parliament. In the provincial elections in Styria, which took place at the same time, the Heimatblock won 12.5% of the votes and 6 seats. In national politics, the election results achieved the opposite of what had been wanted. The Heimatblock cost the Christian Socialists votes and thus played into the hands of the Social Democrats, who won the largest number of votes. The new federal government was nevertheless built by the Christian Socialist Otto Ender as a coalition of middle-class parties. Members of the Heimatblock took their seats in the National Council on the opposition bench, on the far right and in Heimwehr uniform.
The election results further weakened the internal cohesion of the Heimwehr. Starhemberg eventually made way for Walter Pfrimer as the new national leader. He represented a radical course within the Heimwehr and had already used violence several times in Styria to push through political demands. Pfrimer saw that all previous attempts to bring about the desired change in the political system had failed, that the Heimwehr was continuing to break apart and that it was coming under increasing pressure from the growing strength of the Austrian National Socialists. As a result, he decided to risk everything in a coup d&#x27;état which was to finally implement the Heimwehr&#x27;s demands and thus solve all the group&#x27;s problems with one blow. Pfrimer&#x27;s coup attempt in September 1931 failed completely and ultimately led to the Heimwehr movement splitting into a pro-government wing around Steidle and Starhemberg and an anti-government wing around Konstantin Kammerhofer, the leader of the Styrian Heimwehr, which made up the largest segment within the movement.

Martial speeches nevertheless continued to be made at voter meetings and in newspapers. The election appeal in the newspaper of the Heimatschutz stated that the Heimatblock had to &quot;conquer parliament ... in order to build the new state, the Heimatwehr state, on the ruins of the party-political parliament.&quot; In Linz, the Heimwehr functionary Karl Gallian called the Heimatblock &quot;the political machine gun of the Heimatwehr movement&quot;. In the National Council, however, internal disputes and squabbles weakened the Block&#x27;s opposition activities. It was known more for noise and fisticuffs than for political work.

=== In the Dollfuss government ===

When the Christian Socialist government of Karl Buresch had to resign on 6 May 1932, new elections appeared to be necessary. Since the Nazi Party had already made large gains in the regional elections earlier in the year, the Christian Socialists tried to avoid holding one. The Social Democrats and the Greater Germans rejected coalition offers, which left only the Heimatblock and the Landbund to enable Engelbert Dollfuss, then still of the Christian Social Party, to form a government with a majority of just one seat. In the coalition negotiations, the Heimatblock had demanded that Anton Rintelen, the Christian Social governor of Styria and an outspoken friend of the Heimwehr, become chancellor but in the end had to be satisfied with him becoming Minister of Education. Guido Jakoncig, a member of the Heimatblock ranks, became Minister for Trade and Transport.

The Heimwehr&#x27;s involvement in the new government had little support from its rank and file. The provincial leadership of the Styrian Heimwehr even declared its &quot;state of political independence&quot; on 19 May. The Heimatblock was not easy to work with inside the coalition, where it repeatedly objected to proposals made by Chancellor Dollfuss. A motion of no confidence by the Greater German People&#x27;s Party was supported by two Heimatblock deputies and was defeated by 81 votes to 81. The narrow majority made it difficult for the government to pass legislation. A deputy who was out sick, or the voting behaviour of individual Heimatblock members that deviated from the party line, could determine success or defeat in the National Council.

Before the parliamentary summer recess on 19 August 1932, the Social Democratic &quot;Arbeiter-Zeitung&quot; (&quot;Workers&#x27; Newspaper&quot;) wrote: &quot;But in October when Parliament reconvenes, either it will have to be dissolved or another government formed. This governing which depends daily on the respective whims of Mr. Werner or Mr. Hainzl is impossible, untenable, intolerable.&quot;

On 16 October, during a march by National Socialists in Vienna, gunfire broke out between members of the SDAP&#x27;s Republican Protection League, Communists, Nazis and the police. Four people died and many more were wounded. In response, the government the next day created the new position of State Secretary for Security and filled it with the leader of the Vienna Heimatschutz, Emil Fey. He immediately arranged for a ban on marches in Vienna by the political movements involved in the violence.

Dollfuss&#x27; authoritarian course pleased the Heimwehr, and on 5 November 1932 the (&quot;Austrian Heimatschutz Newspaper&quot;) ran the headline: &quot;Commitment to fascism!&quot; and on 25 February 1933: &quot;Away with Parliament!&quot; Seven days later, the wish was fulfilled. With the so-called &quot;Self-elimination of the Austrian Parliament&quot; of 4 March 1933, the way was paved for the dictatorship of Austrofascism. On 24 March, Fey imposed preliminary censorship on the Social Democratic party newspapers &quot;Arbeiter-Zeitung&quot; and &quot;Das Kleine Blatt&quot;, and on 31 March the Republican Protection League was dissolved. The traditional May Day march was also banned.

On 10 May Fey was appointed Minister of Security, and the Heimwehr ideologue Odo Neustädter-Stürmer was appointed State Secretary for Labor Procurement, Labor Service, Roads and Tourism. On 20 May the Fatherland Front was founded, in large part at Starhemberg&#x27;s suggestion. It absorbed Christian Social Party, the Landbund and the Heimwehr and was conceived as a rallying organization in which all political movements except Austromarxism and National Socialism were to be represented. Since the hoped-for movement of the Fatherland Front towards fascism did not proceed to the extent hoped for by much of the Heimwehr, relations with the movement remained contradictory and distrustful. On 19 June 1933, Dollfuss banned the Styrian Heimatschutz alongside the Austrian Nazi Party.
On 11 September 1933, Dollfuss announced the end of the party-state and introduced plans to institute a corporatist order and to change the constitution, with the goal of creating a &quot;social, Christian, German state of Austria on a corporatist basis and under strong authoritarian leadership&quot;. The Heimwehr was thus able to say that its Korneuburg Oath had become a state program. They therefore no longer saw any need to have their own political party, and the Heimatblock was dissolved on 27 September 1933. Before that, it had joined the Fatherland Front so that Emil Fey could be part of the new Dollfuss II government as Vice-Chancellor. Entry of the Heimwehr into the Fatherland Front was agreed on, but a corresponding accord was never signed by Ernst Starhemberg. The resistance within the movement, which did not want to give up its position as an independent political force, was too great.

Even when the corporatist state under Chancellor Dollfuss began to become a reality in 1933, the Heimwehr continued to cause unrest. On 30 January 1934 they staged large-scale armed marches in numerous towns in Tyrol and made demands for the establishment of an authoritarian provincial committee with the participation of Heimwehr members. The Heimwehr also participated in the February Uprising of 12–15 February 1934 that pitted government forces against the Social Democrats and ended with the victory of the Fatherland Front. 

== Final years ==
After the Social Democratic Party was outlawed on 12 February 1934, the Nazi Party became the new enemy of those Heimwehr associations that supported the political course of the federal government, while the associations of Styria and Carinthia moved more and more in the direction of the Nazis and eventually merged organizationally with them.

During the period of the Austrofascist Federal State of Austria (1934–1938), the Heimwehr performed police and security duties as part of the Schutzkorps. During the February uprising and the failed National Socialist July Putsch, they not only took on reconnaissance, guard and security tasks but also independently carried out smaller combat missions, thus relieving other groups such as the gendarmerie and the federal army that were fighting on the government side. When all defence associations () were disbanded in 1936 under Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg, the Heimwehr was for the most part absorbed into the Fatherland Front and the Front Militia ().

== Uniforms ==
A standard uniform was intended for Heimwehr members, but it never came about because members generally had to pay for their own clothing. The men were dressed in both military and civilian dress of all types. Only the mobile Heimwehr formations known as , which were intended to function as a kind of rapid reaction force, were completely and relatively similarly dressed, something that was made possible primarily by the fact that Starhemberg paid for their equipment with his own funds.

Because of their headgear, a hat or cap with a &quot; (a hunter&#x27;s term for the black grouse&#x27;s tail feathers; see the picture of Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg above) that was adopted by the Tyrolean provincial riflemen, they were also called &quot; (&#x27;one with a rooster tail&#x27;). The following mocking verse circulated among their opponents:
&quot; such a poor devil you are.

What a cock has on his behind, you wear with pride on your head.&quot;

<text>A digital raster graphic (DRG) is a digital image resulting from scanning a paper USGS topographic map for use on a computer. DRGs created by USGS are typically scanned at 250 dpi and saved as a TIFF. The raster image usually includes the original border information, referred to as the &quot;map collar&quot;. The map file is UTM projected and georeferenced to the surface of the Earth. DRG&#x27;s are regularly used in GIS applications. DRGs were first produced in 1995.

<doc id="665262" wikidata="Q115220" url="?curid=665262" title="Hiroshima University">
<text>is a Japanese national research university located in Higashihiroshima and Hiroshima, Japan. Established in 1929, it was chartered as a university in 1949 following the merge of a number of national educational institutions. Its abbreviated form is Hirodai.

==History==

Under the National School Establishment Law, Hiroshima University was established on May 31, 1949. After World War II, the school system in Japan was entirely reformed and each of the institutions of higher education under the pre-war system was reorganized. As a general rule, one national university was established in each prefecture, and Hiroshima University became a national university under the new system by combining the pre-war higher educational institutions in Hiroshima Prefecture.

The following eight schools were integrated or merged into Hiroshima University under the new system of education.
* Hiroshima University of Literature and Science
* Hiroshima Higher Normal School
* Hiroshima Women&#x27;s Higher Normal School
* Hiroshima Higher School
* Hiroshima Normal School
* Hiroshima Youth Normal School 
* Hiroshima Higher Technical School
* Hiroshima Municipal Higher Technical School

In 1953-1956, Hiroshima Medical College consolidated into Hiroshima University. 

Some of these institutions were already notable. Above all, Hiroshima School of Secondary Education, founded in 1902, had a distinguished place as one of the nation&#x27;s two centers for training middle school teachers. The Hiroshima University of Literature and Science was founded in 1929 as one of the national universities and, with the Hiroshima School of Secondary Education which was formerly affiliated to it, were highly notable.

The present Hiroshima University, which was created from these two institutions as well as three other &quot;old-system&quot; training institutions for teachers, continues to hold an important position among the universities and colleges in Japan. Hiroshima Higher Technical School, which has many alumnae in the manufacturing industry, was founded in 1920 and was promoted to a Technical College (&quot;Senmon Gakko&quot;) in 1944. Hiroshima Higher School was founded in 1923 as one of the pre-war higher schools which prepared students for Imperial and other government-supported universities. Although these institutions suffered a great deal of damage due to the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, they were reconstructed and combined to become the new Hiroshima University. Graduate schools were established in 1953. After completing the reconstruction, in order to seek wider campus, the relocation to local area(Higashihiroshima) was planned and decided by 1972. Hiroshima University relocated to Higashihiroshima from Hiroshima City between 1982 and 1995. In Hiroshima City, there are still some Campuses (School of Medicine, School of Dentistry, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Graduate School in these fields in Kasumi Campus and Law School and Center for Research on Regional Economic System in Higashi-Senda Campus).

<text>A symmetrical inflation target is a requirement placed on a central bank to respond when inflation is too low as well as when inflation is too high.

For example, the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada have symmetrical inflation targets. Following the strategy review led by the new president Christine Lagarde and finalised in July 2021, also the European Central Bank adopted a symmetric inflation target of two per cent over the medium term and officially abandoned the asymmetric &quot;below but close to two percent&quot; definition.

<text>Simferopol (), also known as Aqmescit, is the second-largest city on the Crimean Peninsula. The city, along with the rest of Crimea, is internationally recognised as part of Ukraine, but controlled by Russia. It is considered the capital of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea.

Since 2014 it has been under the &quot;de facto&quot; control of Russia, which annexed Crimea that year and regards Simferopol as the capital of the Republic of Crimea.

Simferopol is an important political, economic and transport hub of the peninsula, and serves as the administrative centre of both Simferopol Municipality and the surrounding Simferopol District. Its population was 

After the 1784 annexation of the Crimean Khanate by the Russian Empire, the Russian empress decreed the foundation of a city named Simferopol on the location of the Crimean Tatar town of Aqmescit (&quot;White Mosque&quot;).

==Etymologies==

The name Simferopol ( ; ) comes from the Greek &quot;Sympheropoli&quot; (. The spelling Symferopil () is also used.

In Crimean Tatar, the name of the city is &quot;Aqmescit&quot; (or in Cyrillic, , from &quot;Aq&quot; &quot;white&quot;, and &quot;mescit&quot; &quot;mosque&quot;). But &quot;aq&quot; does not refer to the colour of the mosque, but rather to its location in cosmology. The Turkic peoples give a colour designation to the cardinal points, and white is the west. Thus, the exact translation of the name of the town is &quot;the Western Mosque.&quot;

In English, the name was often given as Akmechet or Ak-Mechet (e.g. in the 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;). This was a transliteration from the Russian spelling of Crimean Tatar word Акмечет, Ак-Мечеть, where Mechet (Мечеть) is the Russian word for &quot;mosque&quot;.

==History==
===Early history===
Archaeological evidence in the shows the presence of ancient people living in the territory of modern Simferopol. The Scythian Neapolis, known by its Greek name, is also located in the city, which is the remnants of an ancient capital of the Crimean Scythians who lived in the territory from the 3rd century BC to the 4th century AD.

Later, the Crimean Tatars founded the town of Aqmescit. For some time, Aqmescit was the residence of the Qalğa-Sultan, the second most important position in the Crimean Khanate after the Khan himself. The area of the city once known as Aqmescit is today called Old Simferopol.

===Russian Empire===

In 1784 modern Ukrainian Simferopol was founded after the annexation of the Crimean Khanate to the Russian Empire by Catherine II of Russia. The name Simferopol is in Greek, Συμφερόπολις (&quot;Simferopolis&quot;) and literally means &quot;the city of usefulness.&quot; The tradition of Greek place names in newly acquired southern territories began with the Greek Plan of Russian Empress Catherine the Great. In 1802, Simferopol became the administrative centre of the Taurida Governorate. During the Crimean War of 1854–1856, the Russian Imperial Army reserves and a hospital were stationed in the city. After the war, more than 30,000 Russian soldiers were buried in the city&#x27;s vicinity.

===20th-century wars===
In the 20th century, Simferopol was once again affected by wars and conflicts in the region. At the end of the Russian Civil War, the headquarters of General Pyotr Wrangel, leader of the anti-Bolshevik White Army, were located there. On 13 November 1920, the Red Army captured the city and on 18 October 1921, Simferopol became the capital of the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic.
During World War II, Simferopol was occupied by Nazi Germany from 1 November 1941 to 13 April 1944. Retreating NKVD police shot a number of prisoners on 31 October 1941 in the NKVD building and the city&#x27;s prison. Germans perpetrated one of the largest war-time massacres in Simferopol, killing in total over 22,000 locals—mostly Jews, Russians, Krymchaks, and Romani. On one occasion, starting 9 December 1941, the Einsatzkommando 11b, which was under the command of Werner Braune, whose main unit and superior were Einsatzgruppe D and Otto Ohlendorf, respectively, command killed an estimated 14,300 Simferopol residents, mostly Jewish.

In April 1944 the Red Army liberated Simferopol. On 18 May 1944 the Crimean Tatar population of the city, along with the whole Crimean Tatar nation of Crimea, was forcibly deported to Central Asia as collective punishment for the perceived collaboration of Tatars with Nazi Germany.

===Ukraine===
On 26 April 1954, Simferopol, together with the rest of the Crimean Oblast, was transferred from the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic by Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev.

An asteroid, discovered in 1970 by Soviet astronomer Tamara Mikhailovna Smirnova, is named after the city (2141 Simferopol).

Following a referendum on 20 January 1991, the Crimean Oblast was upgraded to an Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic on 12 February 1991 by the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR.
Simferopol became the capital of the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Simferopol became the capital of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea within newly independent Ukraine. Today, the city has a population of 340,600 (2006) most of whom are ethnic Russians, with the rest being Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar minorities.

After the Crimean Tatars were allowed to return from exile in the 1990s, several new Crimean Tatar suburbs were constructed, as many more Tatars returned to the city compared to number exiled in 1944. Land ownership between the current residents and returning Crimean Tatars is a major area of conflict today with the Tatars requesting the return of lands seized after their deportation.

===Russian annexation===
After Russia occupied and formally annexed Crimea on 18 March 2014, Simferopol was named the capital of a new federal subject of the Russian Federation encompassing the majority of the peninsula by decree of Russian president Vladimir Putin, with the exception of Sevastopol, which became a federal сity.

Prior to the seizure of the city by Russia, a mass protest was organised by the city&#x27;s Crimean Tatars in support of Crimea remaining as part of Ukraine.

==Geography==
===Location===
Simferopol is located in the south-central Crimean Peninsula. The city lies on the Salhir River near the artificial Simferopol Reservoir, which provides the city with clean drinking water. The Simferopol Reservoir&#x27;s earth dam is the biggest in Europe.

===Climate===
The city experiences a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;), near the boundary of the humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfa&quot;). The average temperature in January is and in July. The average rainfall is per year, and there is a total of 2,529 hours of sunshine per year.
==Politics and administrative divisions==


As the capital of Crimea, Simferopol houses its political structure including the Supreme Council of Crimea and the Council of Ministers. Simferopol is also the administrative centre of the Simferopol Raion (district), but is directly subordinate to the Crimean authorities rather than to the district authorities housed in the city itself.

The city of Simferopol is administratively divided into three urban districts (Zaliznychnyi, Kyivskyi and Tsentralnyi), four urban-type settlements (Ahrarne, Aeroflotskyi, Hresivskyi, Komsomolske) and the village of Bitumne.

Viktor Ageev became city mayor on 11 November 2010 and was then elected chairman of the Simferopol City Council on 29 September 2014.

Igor Lukashyov was installed as the head of Simferopol City administration (i.e. local executive) after Russia annexed the region in 2014. He served in this position until his dismissal on 9 November 2018.

==Transportation==
Simferopol has a major railway station, which serves millions of tourists each year. In December 2014 Ukraine cut the railway line to Crimea at the border with mainland Ukraine (Kherson Oblast). Currently, the station serves only a commuter (regional) passenger train and the Moscow – Simferopol train every day.

The city is also connected via the Simferopol International Airport, which was constructed in 1936. Zavodskoye Airport is situated southwest of Simferopol.

The city has several main bus stations, with routes towards many cities, including Sevastopol, Kerch, Yalta, and Yevpatoriya. The Crimean Trolleybus connects Simferopol to the city of Yalta on Crimean Black Sea coast. The line is the longest trolleybus line in the world with a total length of (since 2014 again ).

The streets of Simferopol have a rare house numbering – the odd numbers are on the right side of the road, looking in the direction in which the numbers increase.

==Demographics==

At the last census in 2014, the population of Simferopol was 332,317, the highest of any city in the Republic of Crimea and second only to Sevastopol within the Crimean peninsula.

==Economy==
When it existed, Crimea Air had its head office on the grounds of Simferopol Airport. A new 19-gate terminal for the airport finished construction in 2018. The terminal was designed in the shape of a wave by Samoo Architects &amp; Engineers, after their successful bid as part of an international competition.

The largest collection of higher education institutions in Crimea is located in Simferopol. Among them is the largest university in Simferopol and Crimea, the Taurida V.Vernadsky National University, which was founded in 1917. Crimea State Medical University named after S. I. Georgievsky, also located in Simferopol, is one of the most prominent medical schools of Ukraine. The Crimean Medical University is situated on the plot, where in 1855 a nursery garden was planted by the founder of the Nikita Botanical Gardens Ch.Ch.Steven (1781–1863). In 1863–66 a school for girls was built here and in 1931 a medical institute was opened. On the same plot P.Krzhizhanovsky built a three-storey hostel for medical students after the design in 1934. The building with clear geometric masses was completed in 1938. A new federal university campus was opened 4 August 2014.

==Sports==
Simferopol is home to the football club FC TSK Simferopol which plays in the Crimean Premier League.

<doc id="665280" wikidata="Q3458872" url="?curid=665280" title="Canada and the American Civil War">
<text>At the time of the American Civil War (1861–1865), Canada did not yet exist as a federated nation. Instead, British North America consisted of the Province of Canada (parts of modern southern Ontario and southern Quebec) and the separate colonies of Newfoundland, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, British Columbia and Vancouver Island, as well as a crown territory administered by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company called Rupert&#x27;s Land. Britain and its colonies were officially neutral for the duration of the war. Despite this, tensions between Britain and the United States were high due to incidents such as the &quot; Trent&quot; Affair, blockade runners loaded with British arms supplies bound for the Confederacy, and the Confederate Navy commissioning of the CSS &quot;Alabama&quot; from Britain.

Canadians were largely opposed to slavery, and Canada had recently become the terminus of the Underground Railroad. Close economic and cultural links across the long border, also encouraged Canadian sympathy towards the Union. Between 33,000 and 55,000 men from British North America enlisted in the war, almost all of them fighting for Union forces. Some press and churches in Canada supported the secession, and some others did not. There was talk in London in 1861–62 of mediating the war or recognizing the Confederacy. Washington warned this meant war, and London feared Canada would quickly be seized by the Union army.

==&quot;Trent&quot; Affair==

In November 1861 tensions escalated between Washington and London when an American warship stopped the British mail ship on the high seas and seized two Confederate diplomats, James Mason and John Slidell. London demanded their return and an apology, and to signal its intention to defend its possessions sent 14,000 combat troops to Canada and the Maritimes, while the Canadians planned to raise 40,000 militia. President Abraham Lincoln defused the crisis by releasing the diplomats, though he did not issue an apology. He cautioned his Secretary of State William H. Seward, &quot;One war at a time.&quot; The British decided that unification of the North American colonies was now a high priority, as a new strong dominion would relieve London of the need to station large British forces to defend British North America.

== The Grand Trunk Railway Brigade ==

Rising concerns over the security of railways in Canada while the Civil War raged in the United States led to the 1862 creation of the Grand Trunk Railway Brigade. This unit of Canadian Volunteer Militia recruited amongst railway employees had infantry and artillery companies deployed along the railway lines in Canada East and Canada West.

==Confederate activity in British North America==

Confederate operators secretly used Canada and particularly the Maritimes as a base against the North, in violation of British neutrality. The Maritimes&#x27; struggle to maintain their independence from Canada led some Maritimers to be sympathetic to the South&#x27;s desire to maintain its independence from the North. For example, Halifax merchant Benjamin Wier (1805–1868) acted as Halifax agent for many of the Confederate blockade runners carrying British arms during the Civil War. In return for ship repair facilities in Halifax, the Confederates supplied him with valuable cotton for re-export to Britain, a lucrative but hazardous course for Wier which required severing his business connections with New England. Halifax&#x27;s role in arms trafficking for the South was so noticeable that the &quot;Acadian Recorder&quot; in 1864 described the city&#x27;s effort as a &quot;mercenary aid to a fratricidal war, which, without outside intervention, would have long ago ended.&quot; U.S. Secretary of State Seward complained on March 14, 1865:
Halifax has been for more than one year, and yet is, a naval station for vessels which, running the blockade, furnish supplies and munitions of war to our enemy, and it has been made a rendezvous for those piratical cruisers which come out from Liverpool and Glasgow, to destroy our commerce on the high seas, and even to carry war into the ports of the United States. Halifax is a postal and despatch station in the correspondence between the rebels at Richmond and their emissaries in Europe. Halifax merchants are known to have surreptitiously imported provisions, arms, and ammunition from our seaports, and then transshipped them to the rebels. The governor of Nova Scotia has been neutral, just, and friendly; so were the judges of the province who presided on the trial of the Chesapeake. But then it is understood that, on the other hand, merchant shippers of Halifax, and many of the people of Halifax, are willing agents and abettors of the enemies of the United States, and their hostility has proved not merely offensive but deeply injurious.
Confederate Secret Service agents operating in Canada were considerable enough to be widely tolerated. For example, in Toronto,
Southern agents operated freely and openly with little to no concern from local authorities who were governed by British North America’s official policy of neutrality. Indeed, Southerners enjoyed the sympathy of most of Toronto’s political, social, and business elite—although few were as enthusiastic in supporting the Confederate cause as George Taylor Denison III.
Canadian banks funded their activities and Toronto, Montreal, St. Catharines, and Halifax were among the centers of well-financed Confederate networks by Confederate agents and sympathizers in these cities. Several Canadian hotels across the territory, including the Queen&#x27;s Hotel, Toronto and St. Louis hotel in Quebec City, acted as informal headquarters for Confederate Secret Service activities.

===&quot;Chesapeake&quot;===
On 7 December 1863, while the new Union tug &quot;Chesapeake&quot; was preparing for service in the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, 17 Canadians disguised as passengers seized it off Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Word of the takeover reached Portland on the morning of 9 December and quickly spread from there. The news prompted federal officials at northern ports along the coast to speedy action.

On 17 December, the recently captured blockade runner &quot;Ella and Annie&quot; — which had been hastily manned, armed and sent to sea — caught up with the &quot;Chesapeake&quot; at Sambro, Nova Scotia. Shortly thereafter, the Northern gunboat arrived on the scene; and its commanding officer prevented &quot;Ella and Annie&quot; from taking the recaptured tug back to Boston, lest such action seriously undermine British–U.S. relations. Instead, to observe diplomatic protocols, he escorted &quot;Chesapeake&quot; to Halifax where he asked the colonial Admiralty court to restore it to its owner. The court ruled the Confederate attack was illegal and returned SS &quot;Chesapeake&quot; to its Union owners but the Confederate sympathizers escaped with the help of some Haligonians, creating tensions that received international attention.

=== CSS &quot;Tallahassee&quot; ===
On 18 August 1864, the Confederate States Ship under the command of John Taylor Wood sailed into Halifax harbour for supplies, coal and to make repairs to its mainmast. Wood could only stay 48 hours under neutrality laws and began loading coal at Woodside, on the Dartmouth shore. Union ships &quot;Nansemont&quot; and &quot;Huron&quot; were making their way toward Halifax when Wood slipped out of the harbor at 9 p.m. on 19 August. It is believed he departed by the seldom-used Eastern Passage between McNabs Island and the Dartmouth shore to avoid Union warships in case they had arrived. The channel was narrow and crooked with a shallow tide, so Wood hired a local pilot, Jock Flemming. All the lights were out, but the residents on the Eastern Passage mainland could see the dark hull moving through the water, successfully evading capture.

===St. Albans Raid===
The most-controversial incident was the St. Albans Raid. Montreal was used as the secret base for a team of Confederates attempting to launch covert and intelligence operations from Canada against the United States. To finance their cause in October 1864, they robbed three banks in St. Albans, Vermont, killed an American citizen, and escaped with US$170,000. They were pursued across the Canada–U.S. border by Union forces, creating an international incident. The Canadians then arrested the Confederate raiders, but the judge ruled the raid was an authorized Confederate government operation, not a felony, which would have permitted extradition via the Webster–Ashburton Treaty.

Many Americans falsely suspected that the Canadian government knew of the raid ahead of time. There was widespread anger when the raiders were released by a local court in Canada. U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward let the British government know, &quot;it is impossible to consider those proceedings as either legal, just or friendly towards the United States.&quot;

==Canadian volunteers==
The best recent estimates are that between 33,000 and 55,000 men from British North America (BNA) served in the Union army, and a few hundred in the Confederate army. Many of them already lived in the United States and were joined by volunteers signed up in Canada by Union recruiters. About 2,500 of those British North Americans were Black, with most serving in the US Army and a few hundred in the navy.

Canada refused to return about 15,000 American deserters and draft dodgers.

Calixa Lavallée was a French-Canadian musician and Union officer during the American Civil War who later composed the music for &quot;O Canada&quot;, which officially became the national anthem of Canada in 1980. In 1857, he moved to the United States and lived in Rhode Island where he enlisted in the 4th Rhode Island Volunteers of the Union army during the American Civil War, attaining the rank of lieutenant.

Canadian-born Edward P. Doherty was a Union Army officer who formed and led the detachment of Union soldiers that captured and killed John Wilkes Booth, the assassin of Lincoln, in a Virginia barn on April 26, 1865, 12 days after Lincoln was fatally shot.

Canadian-born Sarah Emma Edmonds was a noted Union spy.

One of the longest-living Canadians to have fought in the American Civil War was James Beach Moore, who died on August 29, 1931.

Anderson Ruffin Abbott was a Toronto-born son of free people of color who had fled Alabama after their store was ransacked. Canada&#x27;s first Black physician, he applied for a commission as an assistant surgeon in the Union Army in February 1863, but his offer was evidently not accepted. That April, he applied to be a &quot;medical cadet&quot; in the United States Colored Troops, but was finally accepted as a civilian surgeon under contract. He served in Washington, D.C., from June 1863 to August 1865, first at the Contraband Hospital which became Freedmen&#x27;s Hospital. He then went to a hospital in Arlington, Virginia. Receiving numerous commendations and becoming popular in Washington society, Abbott was one of only 13 black surgeons to serve in the Civil War, a fact that fostered a friendly relationship between him and the president. On the night of Lincoln&#x27;s assassination, Abbott accompanied Elizabeth Keckley to the Petersen House and returned to his lodgings that evening. After Lincoln&#x27;s death, Mary Todd Lincoln presented Abbott with the plaid shawl that Lincoln had worn to his 1861 inauguration.

At least 29 Canadian-born men were awarded the Medal of Honor.

==Economic effects==
The Civil War period was one of booming economic growth for the BNA colonies. The war in the United States created a huge market for Canada&#x27;s agricultural and manufactured goods, most of which went to the Union. Maritime shipbuilders and owners prospered in the wartime trade boom.

==Political effects==
The American Civil War had decisive political effects on the BNA colonies. The tensions between the United States and Britain, which had been ignited by the war and made worse by the Fenian raids, led to concern for the security and independence of the colonies, helping to consolidate momentum for the confederation of the colonies in 1867.

In this regard, the conflict also had an important effect on discussions concerning the nature of the emerging federation. Many Fathers of Confederation concluded that the secessionist war was caused by too much power being given to the states, and thus resolved to create a more centralized federation. It was also believed that too much democracy was a contributing factor and the Canadian system was thus equipped with checks and balances such as the appointed Senate and powers of the British appointed Governor General. The guiding principles of the legislation which created Canada – the British North America Act – were peace, order, and good government. This was a collectivist antithesis to American individualism that became central to Canadian identity.

<text>Allen Lee Peng-fei, CBE, JP (; 24 April 194015 May 2020) was a Hong Kong industrialist, politician and political commentator. He was a member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, serving from 1978 to 1997 and was the Senior Member of the legislature from 1988 to 1991. He was also an unofficial member of the Executive Council of Hong Kong from 1986 to 1992. He was the founding chairman of the Liberal Party, a pro-business party in 1993 until he retired after he lost the 1998 election. After his retirement, he became a political commentator and hosted &quot;Legco Review&quot;, a RTHK weekly TV programme on the news about Legislative Council, among several other posts.

==Early life and education==
Lee was born on 24 April 1940 in Yantai, Shandong, China to a Chinese businessman. His parents had four children. He followed his family when they moved to Shanghai to evade war and spent most of his childhood there. His father became a merchant in Shanghai and had represented General Motors, among other US companies in China. He later moved to the United States in 1948. Lee had led an independent life and did not know much about his absent father because they seldom stayed together. Lee knew that his father had married several times, which made him feel rather uneasy.

At the age of 14, he was a leader of the Communist Youth League, and organised marches denouncing the United States because of its involvement in the Korean War. In May 1954, his mother sent him to Hong Kong where he attended and graduated from Pui Ying Secondary School. After graduation, he had planned to continue his studies at National Taiwan University but his father intended for him to go to the United States. Subsequently, he was sent to the United States and began learning English in Dayton, Ohio. He was later enrolled in the University of Michigan and studied electronics engineering there.

==Business career==
After his graduation, he worked at the Lockheed Aircraft&#x27;s Electronics Department in California. In 1966, he was appointed by the company to open a branch factory in Hong Kong. Due to a shortage of talented manpower, Lee was invited to serve as the factory&#x27;s Test Engineer and Training Engineer.

In 1970, Lee moved on to work for Ampex as Test Engineering Manager through a friend&#x27;s introduction and was promised the position of general manager after two years of satisfactory performance. He helped the company to set up a factory in Taiwan and a new Design Engineering Department. In 1973/74, Lee became the first Chinese to have ever been appointed general manager. During the time when he was general manager, the 1973 Oil Crisis occurred, which resulted in a sharp decrease in the number of orders. He managed to arrange the workers to take a three-day work week and survived the dire situation after half-year. He also improved the working environment by installing air-conditioning and waxing the floor tiles. He offered the workers a remuneration package with a wage that was 10% above the industry average.

He left Ampex and became Tang Hsiang Chien&#x27;s business partner in 1985, establishing the Meadville Holdings Limited to produce printed circuits board (PCB). Lee and Tang were then chairman and deputy chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries respectively. Lee also set up a copper-clad laminate factory in Dongguan for Meadville.

Simultaneously, Lee and his ex-colleagues from Ampex set up a trading firm that sold copper foils to manufacturers PCBs and cooper-clad laminates. In 1991, he cooperated with a Japanese buyer and set up Jada Electronics Limited, focusing on selling cooper-clad laminates and copper foils, in which partnership had continued until today.

==Political career==

===Member of Executive and Legislative Councils===
In the late 1970s, Hong Kong Governor Sir Murray MacLehose established the Committee of Economic Diversification to advance Hong Kong&#x27;s high technology development. Governor MacLehose visited Ampex in 1977 and listened to Lee&#x27;s outlook on Hong Kong&#x27;s electronic industry. Lee recommended the Governor to build a technology park, but he was snubbed because high technology may incur a high risk. Hong Kong as a result failed to take a head start and was surpassed by South Korea and Taiwan which had built the Hsinchu Science Park. Lee denounced the government for mismatching talents by appointing an Administrative Officer to be the Secretary for Trade and Industry.

In 1978, Lee became the youngest appointee to the Legislative Council of Hong Kong by Sir Murray MacLehose, at the age of 38. He had sat on the Consumer Council and Electronics Industry Training Board before. He also held many public positions, including chairman of the Hong Kong Productivity Council and member of the Vocational Training Council. In 1986, Governor Sir Edward Youde asked him to serve on the Executive Council of Hong Kong.

During his political career, he witnessed the Sino-British negotiations over Hong Kong&#x27;s future after 1997. In May 1983, Allen Lee led a delegation of young professionals to Beijing, which included legislators Stephen Cheong and Selina Chow, as well as barristers Martin Lee and Andrew Li, architect Edward Ho, doctor Natalus Yuen, journalist Mary Lee, Wing On Bank&#x27;s Dr. Philip Kwok and Albert Kwok, financier Leung Kwok-kwong and merchant Christopher Leong. They were greeted by the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Zhongxun. In the delegation, they expressed their wish to keep the status quo in Hong Kong as it was &quot;the best guarantee to maintaining the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong&quot;. They also sought to extend the British rule by 15 to 30 years. He returned to Beijing in October 1983 and was met by the National Security Bureau Zhuang Xin and former Foreign Trade Minister Li Qiang. In the meeting he was told the demands of the young professionals were rejected.

During the Sino-British negotiations over the future of Hong Kong and the drafting of the Sino-British Joint Declaration in December 1984, Lee joined the delegation of Office of the Unofficial Members of the Executive and Legislative Councils (UMELCO) to meet with the British politicians in London and raised concerns about the Joint Declaration. The UMELCO also attempted to mobilise public opinion on the terms of the Sino-British agreement and made known Hong Kong&#x27;s views to both the British and Chinese governments. Legislative Council member Roger Lobo moved a motion to demand a debate in the Legislative Council on the draft of Sino-British Joint Declaration in February 1984. It was backed by Allen Lee.

===Senior member and Liberal Party chairman===
From 1988 to 1991, Lee was the Senior Member of the Legislative Council, succeeding retiring Dame Lydia Dunn. After the Tiananmen Square massacre in June 1989, Lee joined the liberals to launch the Hong Kong People Saving Hong Kong campaign to press Britain to open its doors to all its colonial subjects here and grant them full British passports before the colony is handed back to China in 1997. He and the UMELCO also made concession to the liberals, to agree on a compromised model of a more democratic political system after 1997 in the drafting of the Hong Kong Basic Law.

In the wake of the landslide victory of the liberal forces led by the United Democrats of Hong Kong (UDHK) in the first ever direct election of the Legislative Council in 1991, Lee formed the Co-operative Resources Centre (CRC), a conservative parliamentary group with other appointed and indirectly elected members from the business sectors. He subsequently resigned as Senior Member among accusation of conflict of roles. The CRC later transformed into the Liberal Party in 1993, where he was the founding chairman.

In 1992, he resigned from the Executive Council with other unofficial members after Governor Chris Patten took office. He soon found himself aligned with the Beijing government in opposition to Patten&#x27;s reform proposals which largely expanded the electorates for the 1995 Legislative Council election. He sought to resolve the Sino-Hong Kong confrontation through negotiations. Allen Lee&#x27;s Liberal Party and its allies tried to amend the Patten proposals and was backed by Lu Ping, Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office. However, with the support of the pro-democracy camp, Patten&#x27;s proposals were narrowly passed. For this event, Jonathan Dimbleby described him as a &quot;weather vane&quot; in his book &quot;The Last Governor&quot;.

In the 1995 Legislative Council election, Lee ran in the New Territories North-east. He returned to the Legislative Council by receiving 15,216 votes, 34.82% of the ballots, gaining the only seat for the Liberal Party and becoming the sole conservative candidate to be directly elected. He became closer to the Beijing authorities, being appointed as Hong Kong Affairs Adviser, member of the Preparatory Committee and became member of the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC), a provisional legislature installed by Beijing countering the 1995 elected colonial legislature. He was also made a delegate of the Chinese national legislature, the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC) in late 1997.

In 1998, Lee ran in New Territories East in the first Legislative Council election after the handover of Hong Kong but was narrowly beaten by pro-democratic candidate Cyd Ho, receiving 33,858 votes, 10.25% of the ballots. The defeat marked the end of his political career, as he announced his retirement as Liberal Party chairman after the election results. He stepped down in December 1998 and was succeeded by James Tien.

==Media career and later life==
After his retirement, he became involved in the mass media, taking up posts as TV presenter and radio host. Lee hosted &quot;Legco Review&quot;, a RTHK weekly TV programme on the news about Legislative Council from 2001 until his retirement in March 2018, among several other posts. He became more open to speaking out about his support in democracy and universal suffrage and his criticism of the HKSAR and Chinese governments. He joined the democrats in the 1 July massive protest of 2003 against the legislation of the Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23. He quit the Liberal Party in 2003 over the party leadership&#x27;s decision to drop its commitment to support universal suffrage of the Chief Executive election in 2007 in its manifesto.
In 2004, Lee temporarily replaced Albert Cheng as the host of &quot;Teacup in the Storm&quot;, Hong Kong&#x27;s most prominent current affairs programme on Commercial Radio Hong Kong. Cheng resigned because he had been under pressure from pro-Beijing businessmen to stop being critical of the Beijing government. Lee also resigned two weeks later on 19 May as the radio host citing the same reason, following another anti-government critic Wong Yuk-man who also worked at the Commercial Radio as a talk show host. Lee claimed that one Mainland official had called him at night, praising his wife and daughter before saying that he wanted to talk about his radio show. Lee said his decision to quit was also driven by the fear of possible harassment of his family. The successive resignations of the three hosts sparked a heated political controversy related to press freedom and media self-censorship. Simultaneously, Lee also quit as the delegate of the National People&#x27;s Congress in 2004, saying that he had faced pressure not to speak openly.
In 2013, Lee joined the political group Hong Kong 2020 spearheaded by former Chief Secretary Anson Chan to provide a platform for soliciting views towards consensus on the constitutional changes needed to achieve full universal suffrage in the Chief Executive election in 2017 and the Legislative Council elections in 2020. Lee quitting after a year, citing conflict of interest concerns.

In July 2019, Lee issued a joint statement with other Liberal Party grandees calling on Chief Executive Carrie Lam to officially withdraw the controversial extradition bill which sparked the massive anti-government protests since June, as well as set up an independent commission of inquiry and engage in meaningful dialogue with the public.

==Death==
On 19 May 2020, his family announced that Allen Lee had died on 15 May, at the age of 80.

<doc id="665285" wikidata="Q1164001" url="?curid=665285" title="Select (SQL)">
<text>The SQL SELECT statement returns a result set of rows, from one or more tables.

A SELECT statement retrieves zero or more rows from one or more database tables or database views. In most applications, codice_1 is the most commonly used data manipulation language (DML) command. As SQL is a declarative programming language, codice_1 queries specify a result set, but do not specify how to calculate it. The database translates the query into a &quot;query plan&quot; which may vary between executions, database versions and database software. This functionality is called the &quot;query optimizer&quot; as it is responsible for finding the best possible execution plan for the query, within applicable constraints.

The SELECT statement has many optional clauses:

* codice_1 list is the list of columns or SQL expressions to be returned by the query. This is approximately the relational algebra projection operation.
* codice_4 optionally provides an alias for each column or expression in the codice_1 list. This is the relational algebra rename operation.
* codice_6 specifies from which table to get the data.
* codice_7 specifies which rows to retrieve. This is approximately the relational algebra selection operation.
* codice_8 groups rows sharing a property so that an aggregate function can be applied to each group.
* codice_9 selects among the groups defined by the GROUP BY clause.
* codice_10 specifies how to order the returned rows.

== Overview ==

codice_1 is the most common operation in SQL, called &quot;the query&quot;. codice_1 retrieves data from one or more tables, or expressions. Standard codice_1 statements have no persistent effects on the database. Some non-standard implementations of codice_1 can have persistent effects, such as the codice_15 syntax provided in some databases.

Queries allow the user to describe desired data, leaving the database management system (DBMS) to carry out planning, optimizing, and performing the physical operations necessary to produce that result as it chooses.

A query includes a list of columns to include in the final result, normally immediately following the codice_1 keyword. An asterisk (&quot;codice_17&quot;) can be used to specify that the query should return all columns of all the queried tables. codice_1 is the most complex statement in SQL, with optional keywords and clauses that include:

* The codice_6 clause, which indicates the tables to retrieve data from. The codice_20 clause can include optional codice_21 subclauses to specify the rules for joining tables.
* The codice_7 clause includes a comparison predicate, which restricts the rows returned by the query. The codice_7 clause eliminates all rows from the result set where the comparison predicate does not evaluate to True.
* The codice_24 clause projects rows having common values into a smaller set of rows. codice_24 is often used in conjunction with SQL aggregation functions or to eliminate duplicate rows from a result set. The codice_7 clause is applied before the codice_24 clause.
* The codice_9 clause includes a predicate used to filter rows resulting from the codice_24 clause. Because it acts on the results of the codice_24 clause, aggregation functions can be used in the codice_31 clause predicate.
* The codice_10 clause identifies which columns to use to sort the resulting data, and in which direction to sort them (ascending or descending). Without an codice_33 clause, the order of rows returned by an SQL query is undefined.
* The codice_34 keyword eliminates duplicate data.

The following example of a codice_1 query returns a list of expensive books. The query retrieves all rows from the &quot;Book&quot; table in which the &quot;price&quot; column contains a value greater than 100.00. The result is sorted in ascending order by &quot;title&quot;. The asterisk (*) in the &quot;select list&quot; indicates that all columns of the &quot;Book&quot; table should be included in the result set.
SELECT *
 FROM Book
 WHERE price &gt; 100.00
 ORDER BY title;
The example below demonstrates a query of multiple tables, grouping, and aggregation, by returning a list of books and the number of authors associated with each book.
 SELECT Book.title AS Title,
 count(*) AS Authors
 FROM Book
 JOIN Book_author
 ON Book.isbn = Book_author.isbn
 GROUP BY Book.title;
Example output might resemble the following:

 SQL Examples and Guide 4
 The Joy of SQL 1
 An Introduction to SQL 2
 Pitfalls of SQL 1

Under the precondition that &quot;isbn&quot; is the only common column name of the two tables and that a column named &quot;title&quot; only exists in the &quot;Book&quot; table, one could re-write the query above in the following form:
SELECT title,
 count(*) AS Authors
 FROM Book
 NATURAL JOIN Book_author
 GROUP BY title;
However, many vendors either do not support this approach, or require certain column-naming conventions for natural joins to work effectively.

SQL includes operators and functions for calculating values on stored values. SQL allows the use of expressions in the &quot;select list&quot; to project data, as in the following example, which returns a list of books that cost more than 100.00 with an additional &quot;sales_tax&quot; column containing a sales tax figure calculated at 6% of the &quot;price&quot;.
SELECT isbn,
 title,
 price,
 price * 0.06 AS sales_tax
 FROM Book
 WHERE price &gt; 100.00
 ORDER BY title;
=== Subqueries ===

Queries can be nested so that the results of one query can be used in another query via a relational operator or aggregation function. A nested query is also known as a &quot;subquery&quot;. While joins and other table operations provide computationally superior (i.e. faster) alternatives in many cases (all depending on implementation), the use of subqueries introduces a hierarchy in execution that can be useful or necessary. In the following example, the aggregation function codice_36 receives as input the result of a subquery:
SELECT isbn,
 title,
 price
 FROM Book
 WHERE price &lt; (SELECT AVG(price) FROM Book)
 ORDER BY title;
A subquery can use values from the outer query, in which case it is known as a correlated subquery.

Since 1999 the SQL standard allows WITH clauses, i.e. named subqueries often called common table expressions (named and designed after the IBM DB2 version 2 implementation; Oracle calls these subquery factoring). CTEs can also be recursive by referring to themselves; the resulting mechanism allows tree or graph traversals (when represented as relations), and more generally fixpoint computations.

=== Derived table ===

A derived table is a subquery in a FROM clause. Essentially, the derived table is a subquery that can be selected from or joined to. Derived table functionality allows the user to reference the subquery as a table. The derived table also is referred to as an &quot;inline view&quot; or a &quot;select in from list&quot;.

In the following example, the SQL statement involves a join from the initial Books table to the derived table &quot;Sales&quot;. This derived table captures associated book sales information using the ISBN to join to the Books table. As a result, the derived table provides the result set with additional columns (the number of items sold and the company that sold the books):
SELECT b.isbn, b.title, b.price, sales.items_sold, sales.company_nm
FROM Book b
 JOIN (SELECT SUM(Items_Sold) Items_Sold, Company_Nm, ISBN
 FROM Book_Sales
 GROUP BY Company_Nm, ISBN) sales
 ON sales.isbn = b.isbn
== Examples ==

Given a table T, the &quot;query&quot; will result in all the elements of all the rows of the table being shown.

With the same table, the query will result in the elements from the column C1 of all the rows of the table being shown. This is similar to a &quot;projection&quot; in relational algebra, except that in the general case, the result may contain duplicate rows. This is also known as a Vertical Partition in some database terms, restricting query output to view only specified fields or columns.

With the same table, the query will result in all the elements of all the rows where the value of column C1 is &#x27;1&#x27; being shown in relational algebra terms, a &quot;selection&quot; will be performed, because of the WHERE clause. This is also known as a Horizontal Partition, restricting rows output by a query according to specified conditions.

With more than one table, the result set will be every combination of rows. So if two tables are T1 and T2, will result in every combination of T1 rows with every T2 rows. E.g., if T1 has 3 rows and T2 has 5 rows, then 15 rows will result.

Although not in standard, most DBMS allows using a select clause without a table by pretending that an imaginary table with one row is used. This is mainly used to perform calculations where a table is not needed.

The SELECT clause specifies a list of properties (columns) by name, or the wildcard character (“*”) to mean “all properties”.

== Limiting result rows ==
Often it is convenient to indicate a maximum number of rows that are returned. This can be used for testing or to prevent consuming excessive resources if the query returns more information than expected. The approach to do this often varies per vendor.

In ISO , result sets may be limited by using
* cursors, or
* by adding a SQL window function to the SELECT-statement

ISO introduced the codice_37 clause.

According to PostgreSQL v.9 documentation, an SQL window function &quot;performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row&quot;, in a way similar to aggregate functions.
The name recalls signal processing window functions. A window function call always contains an OVER clause.

=== ROW_NUMBER() window function ===
codice_38 may be used for a &quot;simple table&quot; on the returned rows, e.g. to return no more than ten rows:
SELECT * FROM
( SELECT
 ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY sort_key ASC) AS row_number,
 columns
 FROM tablename
) AS foo
WHERE row_number &lt;= 10

ROW_NUMBER can be non-deterministic: if &quot;sort_key&quot; is not unique, each time you run the query it is possible to get different row numbers assigned to any rows where &quot;sort_key&quot; is the same. When &quot;sort_key&quot; is unique, each row will always get a unique row number.

=== RANK() window function ===
The codice_39 window function acts like ROW_NUMBER, but may return more or less than &quot;n&quot; rows in case of tie conditions, e.g. to return the top-10 youngest persons:
SELECT * FROM (
 SELECT
 RANK() OVER (ORDER BY age ASC) AS ranking,
 person_id,
 person_name,
 age
 FROM person
) AS foo
WHERE ranking &lt;= 10
The above code could return more than ten rows, e.g. if there are two people of the same age, it could return eleven rows.

=== FETCH FIRST clause ===
Since ISO results limits can be specified as in the following example using the codice_37 clause.

SELECT * FROM T 
FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY

This clause currently is supported by CA DATACOM/DB 11, IBM DB2, SAP SQL Anywhere, PostgreSQL, EffiProz, H2, HSQLDB version 2.0, Oracle 12c and Mimer SQL.

Microsoft SQL Server 2008 and higher supports codice_37, but it is considered part of the codice_33 clause. The codice_33, codice_44, and codice_37 clauses are all required for this usage.

SELECT * FROM T 
ORDER BY acolumn DESC OFFSET 0 ROWS FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY

=== Non-standard syntax ===
Some DBMSs offer non-standard syntax either instead of or in addition to SQL standard syntax. Below, variants of the &quot;simple limit&quot; query for different DBMSes are listed:
=== Rows Pagination ===
Rows Pagination is an approach used to limit and display only a part of the total data of a query in the database. Instead of showing hundreds or thousands of rows at the same time, the server is requested only one page (a limited set of rows, per example only 10 rows), and the user starts navigating by requesting the next page, and then the next one, and so on. It is very useful, specially in web systems, where there is no dedicated connection between the client and the server, so the client does not have to wait to read and display all the rows of the server.

==== Data in Pagination approach ====
* codice_46 = Number of rows in a page
* codice_47 = Number of the current page
* codice_48 = Number of the row - 1 where the page starts = (page_number-1) * rows

==== Simplest method (but very inefficient) ====
# Select all rows from the database
# Read all rows but send to display only when the row_number of the rows read is between codice_49 and codice_50
Select * 
from {table} 
order by {unique_key}

==== Other simple method (a little more efficient than read all rows) ====
# Select all the rows from the beginning of the table to the last row to display (codice_50)
# Read the codice_50 rows but send to display only when the row_number of the rows read is greater than codice_48

&lt;br&gt;

==== Method with positioning ====
# Select only codice_46 rows starting from the next row to display (codice_49)
# Read and send to display all the rows read from the database

&lt;br&gt;

==== Method with filter (it is more sophisticated but necessary for very big dataset) ====
# Select only then codice_46 rows with filter:
## First Page: select only the first codice_46 rows, depending on the type of database
## Next Page: select only the first codice_46 rows, depending on the type of database, where the codice_59 is greater than codice_60 (the value of the codice_59 of the last row in the current page)
## Previous Page: sort the data in the reverse order, select only the first codice_46 rows, where the codice_59 is less than codice_64 (the value of the codice_59 of the first row in the current page), and sort the result in the correct order
# Read and send to display all the rows read from the database

== Hierarchical query ==
Some databases provide specialised syntax for hierarchical data.

A window function in is an aggregate function applied to a partition of the result set.

For example,

calculates the sum of the populations of all rows having the same &quot;city&quot; value as the current row.

Partitions are specified using the OVER clause which modifies the aggregate. Syntax:

The OVER clause can partition and order the result set. Ordering is used for order-relative functions such as row_number.

== Query evaluation ANSI ==
The processing of a SELECT statement according to ANSI SQL would be the following:

== Window function support by RDBMS vendors ==
The implementation of window function features by vendors of relational databases and SQL engines differs wildly. Most databases support at least some flavour of window functions. However, when we take a closer look it becomes clear that most vendors only implement a subset of the standard. Let&#x27;s take the powerful RANGE clause as an example. Only Oracle, DB2, Spark/Hive, and Google Big Query fully implement this feature. More recently, vendors have added new extensions to the standard, e.g. array aggregation functions. These are particularly useful in the context of running SQL against a distributed file system (Hadoop, Spark, Google BigQuery) where we have weaker data co-locality guarantees than on a distributed relational database (MPP). Rather than evenly distributing the data across all nodes, SQL engines running queries against a distributed filesystem can achieve data co-locality guarantees by nesting data and thus avoiding potentially expensive joins involving heavy shuffling across the network. User-defined aggregate functions that can be used in window functions are another extremely powerful feature.

== Generating data in T-SQL ==
Method to generate data based on the union all

select 1 a, 1 b union all
select 1, 2 union all
select 1, 3 union all
select 2, 1 union all
select 5, 1
SQL Server 2008 supports the &quot;row constructor&quot; feature, specified in the standard

select *
from (values (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (5, 1)) as x(a, b)

<text>Bad Godesberg () is a borough () of Bonn, southern North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. From 1949 to 1999, while Bonn was the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany, most foreign embassies were in Bad Godesberg. Some buildings are still used as branch offices or consulates.

== Geography ==

Bad Godesberg is located along the hills and cliffs of the west bank of the Rhine river, in west central Germany. Godesberg is also the name of the steep hill, of volcanic origin, on the top of which are the ruins of the Godesburg, a castle destroyed in 1583 during the Cologne War.

== History ==

The following events occurred, per year:
* 722 - First official record of the town, which was named after a nearby mountain, the Woudenesberg (later Godesberg), a basalt cone where the Ubii, a Germanic tribe, worshipped the god Wotan.
* 1210 - On 15 October, Archbishop of Cologne Dietrich I lays the foundation stone of the Godesburg fortress on the Godesberg mountain.
* 1583 - On 17 December, the Godesburg was destroyed by Bavarian troops after Archbishop Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg converted to Protestantism (see Cologne War).
* 1792 - Godesberg becomes a spa resort, with the opening of the Redoute, which later saw receptions of the President of Germany.
* 1925 - Godesberg is allowed to call itself &quot;Bad&quot; Godesberg, identifying it as a spa.
* 1935 - Bad Godesberg attains the status of a town.
* 1938 - Neville Chamberlain meets with Hitler over the Sudetenland crisis at the Rheinhotel Dreesen in Bad Godesberg. Hitler&#x27;s demands concerning Czechoslovakia expressed in Godesberg Memorandum.
* 1944–1945 - Bad Godesberg was the location of a Nazi-operated forced labour camp.
* 1945 - On March 8, Bad Godesberg was the first major German urban district to be transferred to Allied forces control without a battle.
* 1959 - The Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) decided on a new party program, the Godesberg Program.
* 1969 - Godesberg was incorporated into the city of Bonn. Since that time, it has been referred to as the &quot;posh part of Bonn&quot;.

==Infrastructure==
Bonn-Bad Godesberg station is on the Left Rhine line and the line 16 and 63 of the Bonn Stadtbahn.

Circa 2018 a new police station was being built on former Haribo property.

==Politics==

===List of twin cities/sister cities===

Bad Godesberg is twinned with:
* Saint-Cloud, France (1957)
* Frascati, Italy (1960)
* Windsor and Maidenhead, England, United Kingdom (1960)
* Kortrijk, Belgium (1964)

===Friendly cities===
Bad Godesberg has friendly relations with:
* Steglitz-Zehlendorf (Berlin), Germany (1962)
* Yalova, Turkey (1969)

==Culture and attractions==

===Public facilities===

*Kleines Theater im Park (Small Park Theater), venue for theater, boulevard theater, and musicals with few actors
*Haus an der Redoute (House at the Redoute), previously an electoral theater, is nowadays a facility for changing/rotating art galleries
*Piccolo Puppenspiele (Piccolo’s Puppet Show), puppet theater that also travels
*Small Beethoven hall as the headquarters of the Heimatbühne Muffendorf (Home stage of Muffendorf)

===Bad Godesberg in literature===

A whole series of literary works take place in Bad Godesberg. The protagonist of Juli Zeh’s novel &quot;Spieltrieb&quot; (Gaming instinct) are students at the school Päda. Occurring locations in the novel are the school and the villa district.
Heinrich Böll’s novel &quot;Frauen vor Flußlandschaft&quot; is set in the villa district between Bonn and Bad Godesberg.
On October 30 the documentary piece &quot;Zwei Welten&quot; (&quot;Two worlds&quot;) by Ingrid Müller-Münch had its premiere as a chamber play. The author explains that it shows Bad Godesberg in the change of time. It is a city where the worlds of &quot;rich German people&quot; and migrants collide. Nine actors perform excerpts from a protocol of mostly young inhabitants of Bad Godesberg, that Müller Münch took record of. In the pre-report of the piece, the Frankfurter Rundschau called it a &quot;Bad-Godesberg-Phänomen&quot; (Bad Godesberg phenomenon). According to Müller-Münch, these two worlds were closer in Bad Godesberg than they were anywhere else.

===Recurring events===

*Rhein in Flammen on the first Saturday of May: Large Firewokrs and a Ship tour from the Linz am Rhein along Erpel, Unkel, Remagen, Rheinbreitbach, Rhine island Nonnenwerth at Rolandswerth/Bad Honnef, Bad Godesberg, Königswinter to the Rheinaue in Bonn
*FeenCon
Over the course of each year, there are always many diverse events and festivals that are being organized by the Stadtmarketing Bad Godesberg e.V. (city marketing department of Bad Godesberg). Some of which are flea and antique markets, a French market, a kids’ rally (&quot;Tag der Kleinen Bad Godesberger&quot;/&quot;Day of the small Bad Godesbergers&quot;), a city party, a Christmas Market, and a street food festival. 
The 23rd German Fire department day took place in Bad Godesberg from June 21 until June 25, 1961. The first CTIF Games took place in Bad Godesberg, since then the International Association of Fire and Rescue Services CTIF organizes the event every four years in different cities.

===Rhenish traditions===

Several Carnival clubs have devoted themselves to the upkeep of Rhenish traditions, especially the Godesberger Stadtsoldatenkorps (city soldier corps), the Fidelen Burggrafen (merry burgraves) and the AKP (Allgemeine Karnevals Gesellschaft, General Carnival Society). The Coordination Committee of each Carnival Association is the FAGK (Festausschuss Godesberger Karneval, Festival Committee of Godesberger Carnival). In the carnival season, the clubs also organize a variety of meetings, and on the carnival Sunday a lavish parade. All clubs engage in youth work.

<text>Palaniappan Chidambaram (born 16 September 1945), better known as P. Chidambaram, is an Indian politician and lawyer who currently serves as Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha. He served as the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs from 2017 to 2018. He also served as Interim Deputy Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha from 2022 to 2023 under Mallikarjun Kharge.

Chidambaram has served as the Union Minister of Finance four times. Most recently, he held the role for the entirety of the United Progressive Alliance government from 2004 to 2014, except for a three-year period as Minister of Home Affairs, during which he oversaw India&#x27;s domestic security response to the 26/11 terrorist attack in Mumbai. Chidambaram returned as Finance Minister in July 2012, succeeding Pranab Mukherjee, who resigned to become the President of India. He was included in &quot;Time&quot; 100 list in 2013. He was also the head of Congress Manifesto Committee for 2019 Lok Sabha Elections and 2024 Indian General Elections.

==Early life and education==
Chidambaram was born to Kandanur L. Ct. L. Palaniappa Chettiar and Lakshmi Achi at Kanadukathan in the Sivaganga district of Tamil Nadu. His maternal grandfather was Raja Sir Annamalai Chettiar, a wealthy merchant and banker from Chettinad.

Chidambaram did his schooling at the Madras Christian College Higher Secondary School, Chennai. He then passed the one-year Pre-university course from Loyola College, Chennai. After graduating with a BSc degree in Statistics from the Presidency College, Chennai, he completed his Bachelor of Laws from the Madras Law College (Dr. Ambedkar Government Law College) and his MBA from Harvard Business School in the class of 1968. He also holds a Master&#x27;s degree from Loyola College, Chennai.

During this time, his politics inclined to the left and in 1969 he joined N. Ram, later an editor of &quot;The Hindu&quot;, and the women&#x27;s activist Mythili Sivaraman in starting a journal called the &quot;Radical Review&quot;.

Chidambaram has two brothers and one sister. His father&#x27;s business interests covered textiles, trading and plantations in India. He chose to concentrate on his legal practice and stayed away from the family business.

Chidambaram enrolled as a lawyer in the Madras High Court, becoming a senior advocate in 1984. He had offices in Delhi and Chennai and practiced in the Supreme Court and various high courts of India.

==Political career==

Chidambaram was elected to the Lok Sabha (lower house) of the Indian Parliament from the Sivaganga constituency of Tamil Nadu in general elections held in 1984. He was a union leader for MRF and worked his way up in the Congress party. He was the Tamil Nadu Youth Congress president and then the general secretary of the Tamil Nadu Pradesh Congress Committee unit. He was inducted into the Union (Indian federal) Council of Ministers in the government headed by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on 21 September 1985 as a Deputy Minister in the Ministry of Commerce and then in the Ministry of Personnel. His main actions during his tenure in this period was to control the price of tea and he has been criticized by the Government of Sri Lanka for destroying the Sri Lankan tea trade by fixing the prices of the commodity in India using state power. He was elevated to the rank of Minister of State in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in January 1986. In October of the same year, he was appointed to the Ministry of Home Affairs as Minister of State for Internal Security. He continued to hold both offices until general elections were called in 1989. The Indian National Congress government was defeated in the general elections of 1989.
In June 1991, Chidambaram was inducted as a Minister of State (Independent Charge) in the Ministry of Commerce, by the then Prime Minister Mr P V Narasimha Rao; a post he held till July 1992. He was later re-appointed Minister of State (Independent Charge) in the Ministry of Commerce in February 1995 and held the post until April 1996. He made some radical changes in India&#x27;s export-import (EXIM) policy, while at the Ministry of Commerce.

In 1996, Chidambaram quit the Congress party and joined a breakaway faction of the Tamil Nadu state unit of the Congress party called the Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC). In the general elections held in 1996, TMC along with a few national and regional level opposition parties, formed a coalition government. The coalition government came as a big break for Chidambaram, who was given the key cabinet portfolio of Finance. His 1997 budget is still remembered as the dream budget for the Indian economy. The coalition government was a short-lived one (it fell in 1998), but he was reappointed to the same portfolio in the government formed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2004.

In 1998, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) took the reins of the government for the first time and it was not until May 2004 that Chidambaram would be back in government. Chidambaram became Minister of Finance again in the Congress party led United Progressive Alliance government on 24 May 2004. During the intervening period Chidambaram made some experiments in his political career, leaving the TMC in 2001 and forming his own party, the Congress Jananayaka Peravai, largely focused on the regional politics of Tamil Nadu. The party failed to take off into mainstream Tamil Nadu or national politics. After the elections of 2004, when the Congress won the election he was inducted into the Council of Ministers under the new Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as cabinet Minister of Finance and he merged his party with the mainstream Congress party.

On 30 November 2008, he was appointed the Union Home Minister following the resignation of Shivraj Patil who had come under intense pressure to tender his resignation following a series of terror attacks in India, including the Mumbai attacks on 26 November 2008.

He has been credited with taking the bold decision of prioritising elections above corporate demands to deploy security for the 2009 Indian Premier League.

In 2009, Chidambaram was re-elected from the Sivaganga Lok Sabha constituency in the Congress and retained the Home ministry. He was one of the representatives of the central government when a tri-party agreement was signed with the Gorkha Hill Council and the Government of West Bengal, an agreement which was a result of Mamata Banerjee&#x27;s effort to end a decade long unrest in the hills of Darjeeling.

The Indian National Congress appointed P. Chidambaram as one of thirteen senior spokespersons on 15 September 2014.
He ceded his seat to his son Karti in 2014, which resulted in electoral defeat for his son. In 2016, he was elected as an MP of the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Indian parliament from the state of Maharashtra.

== Positions Held ==
==Family and personal life==
Chidambaram&#x27;s mother, Lakshmi Acchi, was the daughter of Sir Annamalai Chettiar, a banker and merchant, and was granted the title of &quot;Raja&quot; by British. Annamalai Chettiar was the founder of Annamalai University and United India Insurance Company Limited. His brother, Ramaswami Chettiar, was the founder of the Indian Bank and the co-founder of another major bank, the Indian Overseas Bank.

He is married to Nalini Chidambaram, daughter of Justice (Retd.) Palapatti Sadaya Goundar Kailasam, of the Supreme Court, and Mrs. Soundra Kailasam, a renowned Tamil poet and author. Nalini Chidambaram is a senior advocate practising in the Madras High Court and the Supreme Court of India. He has a son, Karti P. Chidambaram, who graduated with a BBA degree from the University of Texas, Austin, and a Masters in Law from the University of Cambridge. Karti, a member of the Congress Party&#x27;s AICC, is active in Tamil Nadu state politics. Karti is married to Dr. Srinidhi Rangarajan, a well-known Bharathanatyam dancer and medical doctor, working with the Apollo Group of Hospitals in Chennai. Karti and Srinidhi have a daughter, Aditi Nalini Chidambaram.

=== Health Issues ===

He suffers from a medical condition referred to as Crohn&#x27;s disease.

==Controversies==

The Voluntary Disclosure of Income Scheme (VDIS) 1997, which he announced when he was Finance Minister with the United Front government, was condemned by the Controller and Auditor General of India as abusive because of the loopholes that made it possible to fudge data to the financial advantage of the confessor.

Chidambaram was criticised for his ministry&#x27;s failure to prevent the 2011 Mumbai bombings, despite massive investments in security following the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Three years after the 2008 attacks, security preparations were proven to be inadequate with channel breakdown and failures in modernising, procuring, and installing security equipment. Chidambaram defended the agencies under his ministry against the charge of intelligence failure with the response which was later ridiculed by many people in India and its media:

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J.Jayalalithaa wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner in 2011 that data entry operators at Sivaganga had transferred 3,400 votes polled by Kannappan from 11 polling stations in Chidambaram&#x27;s favour. News reports suggest that on May 16, 2009, the AIADMK candidate Raja Kannappan was declared elected by 3555 votes at 12.30 pm, and the news was also broadcast on television. But in a dramatic reversal a few hours later, P Chidambaram was declared elected by 3354 votes at 4.30 pm, and was confirmed as the winner after a recount at 8.30 pm.

On 7 April 2009, Chidambaram was assaulted by Sikh journalist Jarnail Singh during a press conference in Delhi on the issue of a &quot;clean chit&quot; to Jagdish Tytler. Singh, who writes for the Hindi daily newspaper &quot;Dainik Jagaran&quot; was dissatisfied with Chidamabaram&#x27;s answer to a question on the Central Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s (CBI) &quot;clean chit&quot; regarding Jagdish Tytler&#x27;s involvement in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. It was the first shoe throwing incident in India.

Chidambaram was part of Vedanta&#x27;s legal team and on its board before becoming finance minister in 2004 [42]. In 2002, a year before UK&#x27;s Financial Services Authority allowed Sterlite to reconstitute itself as Vedanta Resources Plc, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) served a show-cause notice on three of Chairman Anil Agarwal&#x27;s family. The notice was a demand that Sterlite directors answer allegations about using their holding companies-Volcan and Twinstar-to avoid paying taxes on forex transactions. It was a polite way of saying there was prima facie evidence, dating back to 1993, that the Agarwals were guilty of money laundering. For seven years the case dragged on in courts as Sterlite employed top lawyers to use every possible delaying tactic. P. Chidambaram argued in Sterlite&#x27;s defence in a 2003 Bombay High Court case related to the ED&#x27;s allegations. The following year, Chidambaram found himself appointed non-executive director on the board of Vedanta Resources Plc. And very soon, he became finance minister in UPA 1.

Former Union Minister and Senior Advocate Ram Jethmalani&#x27;s letter to Chidambaram on 6 December 2013 accused him of acting in collusion with the NDTV and laundering Rs 5000 crores of money through Mauritius route back to India.

=== INX Media, Aircel-Maxis case ===

In 2006, political leader Dr. Subramanian Swamy alleged that a company controlled by Karti Chidambaram, the son of Minister of Finance P. Chidambaram, received a five-percent share of Aircel to get part of 40 billion paid by Maxis Communications for the 74-percent share of Aircel. According to Swamy, Chidambaram withheld Foreign Investment Promotion Board clearance of the deal until his son received the five-percent share in Siva&#x27;s company. The issue was raised a number of times in Parliament by the opposition, which demanded Chidambaram&#x27;s resignation. Although Chidambaram and the then ruling Congress government denied the allegations, &quot;The Pioneer&quot; and &quot;India Today&quot; reported the existence of documents showing that Chidambaram delayed approval of the foreign direct investment proposal by about seven months. It was alleged that Chidambaram&#x27;s son, Karti was a direct beneficiary of the 2G spectrum case. His company, Advantage Strategic Consulting had a five per cent stake in Aircel Televentures, even as his father P Chidambaram, as Finance minister, was alleged to have offered FIPB clearance for the Aircel-Maxis deal only if his son&#x27;s company, Advantage Strategic Consulting, got shares in Aircel Ventures. The Enforcement Directorate is currently investigating his involvement in Aircel deal. In 2012, and, subsequently, in 2016, information of wide-scale corruption by Chidambaram&#x27;s son Karti Chidambaram and Robert Vadra, with the help of his father&#x27;s position, including through the Airtel–Maxis deal and the Uttar Pradesh NRHM scam, was unveiled in prominent newspapers and media in India. Simultaneously, Chidambaram and his son Karti have been dogged with allegations of corruption, misuse of position, insider trading and money laundering.

===Imprisonment===

On 20 August 2019, the Delhi High Court dismissed both anticipatory bail pleas of Chidambaram in connection with corruption charges in the INX Media case during his tenure as Finance minister in UPA Government. On 21 August, he appeared at the Congress HQ and addressed a press conference stating that he was &quot;not accused&quot;; however, he left the place, and, later, he was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement Directorate at his home. On 5 September 2019, Supreme Court dismissed his appeal against rejection of anticipatory bail plea by Delhi High Court. The Special Court ordered Chidambaram to stay in judicial custody in Tihar Jail for 14 days. On 4 December he was granted bail by the supreme court.

<text>The Welsh Open is a professional ranking snooker tournament that has been held annually since 1992. It replaced the Welsh Professional Championship, which ran annually from 1980 to 1991 and was open only to Welsh players. The Welsh Open is now the longest running ranking event after the World Championship and the UK Championship. Since the 2016–17 season, it has been one of four tournaments in the Home Nations Series, alongside the Northern Ireland Open, the Scottish Open, and the English Open. Since 2017, the winner of the event has received the Ray Reardon Trophy, named after the Welsh six-time world champion. Reardon himself presented the newly named trophy to 2017 winner Stuart Bingham.

Mark Williams is the only Welsh winner, having captured the title in 1996 and 1999. John Higgins holds the record for the most Welsh Open wins, claiming the title five times.

Mark Selby is the reigning champion.

== History ==
The tournament began as a ranking tournament in 1992. It is now the third-longest-running ranking event on the World Snooker Tour, after the World Championship and the UK Championship. In the 2016–17 season, the event became part of the Home Nations Series, alongside the Northern Ireland Open, the Scottish Open, and the English Open. The event trophy was renamed the Ray Reardon Trophy; Reardon himself presented the first trophy bearing his name to the 2017 winner Stuart Bingham.

The event was sponsored by Regal until 2003, but UK restrictions on tobacco advertising meant that it was without a sponsor until 2009. The tournament was sponsored by Totesport.com in 2010, by Wyldecrest Park Homes in 2011, by 888真人 in 2012, and by BetVictor from to 2013 to 2016. In 2017 the tournament was sponsored by Coral. 

In 1996, Paul Hunter reached the semi-finals at the age of 17 years and 111 days, becoming the youngest player to reach this stage of a ranking tournament.

John Higgins holds the record for the most Welsh Open titles, having won the event on 5 occasions. The other multiple winners are Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan with 4 victories, Stephen Hendry with 3, and Steve Davis, Ken Doherty, Paul Hunter, Mark Williams and Neil Robertson with 2 wins each.

Like the Welsh Professional Championship, it was played at the Newport Centre in Newport, before moving to the Cardiff International Arena in 1999. It was moved back to Newport in 2005, where it remained until 2014. In January 2014, World Snooker chairman Barry Hearn announced that the 2014 tournament would be the last held in Newport, and that he would open negotiations to move the event to a larger venue, most likely in Cardiff. The event was held at the Motorpoint Arena in Cardiff from 2015 to 2020, before moving back to Newport in 2021 and 2022. The 2023 event was held in Llandudno, the first time in its history that it has been staged in neither Newport nor Cardiff. The tournament is broadcast by BBC Wales, Eurosport, CCTV, SMG, Now TV and Showtime Arabia. In the early days it was televised by both BBC Wales (in English), S4C (in Welsh) and Sky Sports.

There have been ten maximum breaks in the history of the tournament. The first was made by Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan in 1999, against James Wattana. The second was made at the qualifying stage of the 2000 event by Barry Pinches, against Joe Johnson. The third was made by Andrew Higginson in 2007, against Ali Carter. The fourth 147 was made in 2011 by Stephen Hendry, against Stephen Maguire. This was Hendry&#x27;s 10th 147 break, and with this he equalled the record for most maximums with Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan. He also became the oldest player at the time to compile a maximum break at the age of 42 years and 35 days. The fifth maximum was made by O&#x27;Sullivan in 2014, in the last frame of the final against Ding Junhui. This was O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s 12th 147 break, and with it he set the record for most maximums. It was also the last maximum to be compiled before the event moved to Cardiff. Ding Junhui made the sixth at the quarter-finals of the 2016 tournament, against Neil Robertson. Two maximum breaks were made at the 2019 event, one by Neil Robertson in the first round, against Jordan Brown, and one by Noppon Saengkham in the third round, against Mark Selby. The ninth maximum was made in 2020 by Kyren Wilson on his first visit to the table in his first round match against Jackson Page. Shaun Murphy made the tenth maximum break in 2023 in his third round match against Daniel Wells. The most recent maximum break was compiled by Gary Wilson in 2024, during the semi-final against Higgins.

Dark Horse Comics announced the publication of &quot;The Art of Emily Volume One&quot;, the first collection of images showing the wide and inspired range of artistic styles and mediums that have been used to create the world of Emily the Strange: silk-screened vinyl skateboard stickers to custom rock-and-roll album art, large-scale psychedelic paintings, and intricate Mongolian paper cutting, the fantastic and artful imaginings of Rob Reger, Buzz Parker, and a large number of collaborators.

Since 2008 Emily the Strange has been published in France by Soleil Productions.

In October 2007, it was first announced that four young adult novels based on the Emily the Strange character will be published by HarperCollins. They will be co-written by Rob Reger and Jessica Gruner.

The first HarperCollins novel, &quot;Emily the Strange: The Lost Days&quot;, was released in June 2009. Written in a diary format, it opens with Emily attempting to recover her memory and regain her sense of style. Co-author Rob Reger says the book maps new territory inside the mind of his popular character. &quot;In the past, it’s been us describing her,&quot; he says. &quot;This is the first time anybody gets to hear how she talks to herself and her cats.&quot;.

The next book in HarperCollins&#x27; four-book series, &quot;Emily the Strange: Stranger and Stranger&quot;, was released in March 2010. In this book Emily is back in Blandindulle and preparing to move to a new town. While experimenting with her supply of Blackrock and duplicating device she accidentally clones herself. Enjoying the benefit of a second Emily at first, the real Emily comes across problems such as identity crisis and loss of some of her unique talents. Not to mention the fact that her clone thinks &quot;she&quot; is the real Emily and evidently plans to end Emily Strange for good.

The third HarperCollins book, &quot;Emily the Strange: Dark Times&quot; was released on December 27, 2011. Emily is in Duntztown when she needs a student ID to obtain a discount at the local hardware store. After going to school and borrowing an ID, she decides to homeschool herself literally, as opposed to lying about it in the past two books. During a seminar &quot;History of the Strange Family 101&quot;, Emily finds out that her Great-Aunt Lily died by white fever at age 13, though she had healing powers and could probably heal herself. A rumor that a Dark Aunt caused her death is spreading too. Emily goes to Blackrock to find black rock for her Time Out Machine, only to find that Blackrock is not there and that the caravan is with her. She learns about Boris, Attikol&#x27;s ancestor, and decides to time travel into 1790 to save Lily and take Boris off her tail using a moving, severed cat&#x27;s tail.

The fourth and final HarperCollins book, &quot;Emily the Strange: Piece of Mind&quot; was also released on December 27, 2011. It includes:

1. The Thought Thief
2. Ancestral enemies (and a few ancestral friends)
3. Modern-day Seasidetown
4. FelinoMobileTranscriptoSpy devices
5. Abandoned souvenir kiosk
6. Jakey&#x27;s memories
7. Super secret book vault
8. Stolen blueprints
9. Regret Maneuvers A through Z
10. Final exams in Particle Physics and How-to With Glue
11. Hero-worshipping engineers
12. The 13th Dark Girl
13. Black rock

On January 30, 2013, Dark Horse Comics and Rob Reger brought &quot;Emily and The Strangers&quot; #1. And then in March came &quot;Emily and The Strangers&quot; #2. In July came &quot;Emily and The Strangers&quot; #3.

===Comic Book series===


===Collected Comic Book editions===
Emily the Strange is collected in trade paperbacks and limited-edition hardcovers, each including extra material from the original publications.


===Harper Collins young adult novel series===
In June 2009, &quot;Emily the Strange: The Lost Days&quot; was first published through HarperCollins’ children imprint branch. Subsequently, three more young adult novels followed, all written by Rob Reger and Jessica Gruner, and illustrated by Rob Reger and Buzz Parker. 
==Brand expansion==
The Emily the Strange franchise has a considerable merchandising catalog, including clothing, stationery, stickers and fashion accessories. All of the products feature Emily&#x27;s distinctive appearance and frequently feature one of her cynical sayings such as &quot;Get Lost,&quot; &quot;Be All You Can&#x27;t Be,&quot; or &quot;Wish You Weren&#x27;t Here&quot;.

==Retail stores==

Cosmic Debris has opened four Emily the Strange flagship stores to date (Taiwan, Taipei, Hong Kong and Greece), with plans to open Emily the Strange retail stores in the Americas in the following years.

In 2005, the company partnered with British punk rock band The Damned, in the release and artwork for their single Little Miss Disaster. Other co-branding alliances and partnerships have included Jones Soda, Gibson Guitars, Zippo, and Manic Panic (hair coloring, nail polishes and colorful extensions).

==Clothing==
In July/August 2003 &quot;V&quot; magazine ran a double page spread of clothing inspired by the character, created by Chanel, Gautier, Helmut Lang, Marc Jacobs, and others. Emily has been shown in &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; and on &quot;MADtv&quot;. Celebrities including Julia Roberts, Britney Spears, and Björk have all worn the brand. Epiphone has created an Emily the Strange-themed SG guitar, based on an Epiphone G-310, with a bolt-on neck, customized Emily the Strange graphics, and a special strap.

Since 2010 Emily the Strange apparel is manufactured and distributed by Italian company Pier Spa.

==In other media==
Rob Reger designed and included the Emily the Strange cartoon in a 12-page foldout booklet for the album &quot;BatBox&quot; by Miss Kittin in 2008.

Since 2000, Rob Reger has been trying to make a feature film adaptation of &quot;Emily&quot;. In 2005, Fox Animation went to make a live action/animated feature film, with Chris Meledandri and John Cohen producing it. Mike Richardson, of Dark Horse Entertainment, came on board as a producer in 2008. The same year it was unofficially reported that the film moved to Universal Studios&#x27; owned Illumination Entertainment, along with the studio&#x27;s founders, Meledandri and Cohen. In September 2010, Universal Studios acquired the rights to the comic, and the actress Chloë Grace Moretz was cast in the role of Emily. Melisa Wallack, who wrote the script for &quot;Mirror Mirror&quot;, was hired to write the adaptation in the following year in August. Two months later it was confirmed that the film was indeed in the works at Illumination Entertainment. Kealan O&#x27;Rourke was brought to rewrite the film&#x27;s script. By December 2016, Universal abandoned the project, and Dark Horse Entertainment and Amazon Studios were in negotiations to make an animated film. In October 2024, Warner Bros. Pictures Animation and Bad Robot announced their collaboration on a full-length animated feature based on &quot;Emily the Strange&quot;. The film&#x27;s screenplay is being developed by Pamela Ribon, as Bad Robot will produce the film, with Reger serving as executive producer alongside Trevor Duke-Moretz.

==Cats==
Emily is usually shown accompanied by four black cats. Sabbath, the newest cat to join the Strange family, is usually identified by a tear on one of his ears and one bent whisker. Miles, the most artistic cat of the group and also the fastest, is identified by his pointy ears, X-mark over his right eye and two pointy whiskers. Nee Chee, the thinker of the group (also known as the schemer), is identified by the black and white stripes on his tail caused by a chemical spill, as well as three whiskers. Mystery, the leader of the group and the only female of the four cats, seems to be the closest to Emily, and therefore thought to be the cat that has been with Emily the longest. Mystery is identified by the star on her collar, one curly whisker and occasionally a star on her left eye.

==Character origin controversy==

The very first Emily the Strange illustration dates from 1991, but the 1978 children&#x27;s book &quot;Nate the Great Goes Undercover&quot; features a very similar illustration of a young girl named Rosamond. She also has long black hair and is frequently accompanied by her black cats. When Rosamond is introduced she wears a short dress and white Mary Jane shoes, similar to Emily, and in a similar pose.

This illustration is accompanied by the text, &quot;Rosamond did not look hungry or sleepy. She looked like she always looks. Strange.&quot; The first Emily the Strange design by Cosmic Debris says: &quot;Emily did not look tired or happy. She looked like she always looks. Strange.&quot;

When Rosamond&#x27;s creators, Marjorie Sharmat and Marc Simont, allegedly began contacting companies who had contracts related to Emily the Strange and urged them to drop their relationships with Cosmic Debris, Cosmic Debris sued Sharmat and Simont. Sharmat and Simont counter-sued. &quot;Emily the Strange, like Rosamond, is a young girl in a short dress, black tights, and Mary Jane shoes. Emily, like Rosamond, has long dark hair with square-cut bangs. Emily, like Rosamond, is typically attended by four black cats. Emily, like Rosamond, is described as being strange and has a fascination with dark themes,&quot; alleged the complaint.

Cosmic Debris contended that Emily and Rosamond both drew from a tradition of similar characters including Vampira and Wednesday Addams, and argued that while the text of the initial Emily illustration was nearly identical with Sharmat&#x27;s text, that illustration had been withdrawn in 1998 and the statute of limitations had therefore run out.

On August 12, 2009, the creator of Emily the Strange and the creators of Nate the Great jointly announced an agreement resolving all disputes between them. Each side agreed to give up all claims against the other as part of their settlement. &quot;We recognize that Emily and Rosamond are both unique and original characters, and we are pleased that we were able to resolve this dispute,&quot; said Marjorie Sharmat and Marc Simont. &quot;We wish Rob, Cosmic Debris, Emily and her fans all the very best.&quot;

<text>Daniel James Wolf (born September 13, 1961 in Upland, California) is an American composer.

== Studies ==
Wolf studied composition with Gordon Mumma, Alvin Lucier, and La Monte Young, as well as musical tunings with Erv Wilson and Douglas Leedy and ethnomusicology (M.A., Ph.D. 1990 Wesleyan University). Important contacts with Lou Harrison, John Cage, Walter Zimmermann. Managing Editor of the journal &quot;Xenharmonikon&quot;, 1985-89. Based in Europe from 1989, he is known as a member of the &quot;Material&quot; group of composers, along with Hauke Harder, Markus Trunk and others.

== Compositions ==
Wolf&#x27;s compositions apply an experimental approach to musical materials, with a special interest in intonation, yet often display a surface that playfully - if accidentally - recalls historical music. Major works include &quot;The White Canoe&quot;, an opera seria for hand puppets to the libretto by Edward Gorey, six string quartets, &quot;Figure &amp; Ground&quot; for string trio, &quot;Field Study&quot; for vn, tb, ban, gui, &quot;Decoherence for x orchestras of x players&quot;, &quot;Twoity&quot; fl,pf and &quot;A Beckett Gray Code&quot; for wind quintet. Much of his music is in just intonation, but his work with alternative tunings includes a collection of Etudes in all equal temperaments between 8 and 23 notes per octave.

Composer Wolf identifies with the experimental music tradition—especially its American West Coast manifestation—spiritually, intellectually and personally. He jokingly calls his method &quot;dysfunctional harmony&quot; or &quot;not yet tonal&quot;, with some reference to the &quot;anarchic harmony&quot; found in the late music of John Cage. Three distinct streams combine to form Wolf&#x27;s work: sound installations, experimental concert works based on sound structures mostly free from historical associations, and experimental concert works based on reifying the tradition of European art music (or other world musics) and then performing operations on its internal principles.

<text>James Michael Colclough (March 31, 1936 – May 16, 2004) was an American football flanker-split end, member of the original Boston Patriots team in the American Football League (AFL) and later head coach of the Division III Boston State College football team. Known as Coleslaw, a spin off his last name, Colclough played college football at Boston College, one season as a defensive back in the Canadian Football League (CFL) with the Montreal Alouettes in 1959 and nine more with the Patriots from 1960 to 1968, including the AFL&#x27;s inaugural 1960 season.

In 2009, Colclough was named to the Patriots&#x27; 1960s All-Decade Team. His 17.7-yards average per reception ranks third in franchise history and his 39 touchdown catches are fourth on its all-time list.

Among receivers, Colclough was one of the premier deep threats in Patriots history. His ten receptions for touchdowns and 21.7 yards per reception in 1962 earned him a spot on the East Division All-Star team. His career highlights included a seven-reception, 142-yard, two-touchdown performance in a 45-17 romp over the Denver Broncos on Sept. 16, 1961 at Nickerson Field. Overall, he had 283 receptions for 5,001 yards and 39 touchdowns in his AFL career.

In 1970, Colclough partnered with two of the most eligible bachelors in professional sports, Derek Sanderson of the NHL&#x27;s Boston Bruins and Joe Namath of the NFL&#x27;s New York Jets, as proprietors of the popular &quot;Bachelors 
III&quot; dating bar in downtown Boston.

After retirement as a player, Colclough served as the head coach at Boston State College in the 1978 and 1979 campaigns. Under his tutelage, the Warriors compiled a 10–8 record in the New England Football Conference (currently Commonwealth Coast Football). In his first season, they were NEFC co-champions with a 6–2 record (6–3 overall).

Colclough died on May 16, 2004, at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston from complications of hepatitis C.

<text>TVCG 1 is a Montenegrine television channel that is part of Radio Television of Montenegro (RTCG). It was established in 1964 under the auspices of RTT. The channel specializes mainly in news and national productions.

==History==
Although relays of Italian television have been available in Montenegro under Yugoslav rule since 1956, it wasn&#x27;t until 4 May 1964 when the local television station started. On this day, the first news report from the Titograd newsroom was presented. By 1968, the regular weekly chronicle &quot;Kroz Crna Gora&quot; began, which in 1971 grew into the daily service &quot;Novosti dana&quot;. A sports team was also set up around this time.

The first daily television news service (&quot;Dnevnik&quot;) was broadcast in 1975. In 1979, Titograd TV joined the Eurovision network at the opening of the TV Festival of non-aligned countries in Bar.

By moving to new facilities in 1984, RTT received improved professional conditions for work.

In 1991, the channel adopted its current name, TVCG 1, gaining a more autonomous schedule in 1997. As early as 1998, when RTCG began to distance itself from Slobodan Milošević&#x27;s policies and the official stance coming from Belgrade, its television output began to increase.

<text>Psychedelic therapy (or psychedelic-assisted therapy) refers to the proposed use of psychedelic drugs, such as psilocybin, ayahuasca, LSD, psilocin, mescaline (peyote), DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, Ibogaine, MDMA, to treat mental disorders. As of 2021, psychedelic drugs are controlled substances in most countries and psychedelic therapy is not legally available outside clinical trials, with some exceptions.

The procedure for psychedelic therapy differs from that of therapies using conventional psychiatric medications. While conventional medications are usually taken without supervision at least once daily, in contemporary psychedelic therapy the drug is administered in a single session (or sometimes up to three sessions) in a therapeutic context. The therapeutic team prepares the patient for the experience beforehand and helps them integrate insights from the drug experience afterwards. After ingesting the drug, the patient normally wears eyeshades and listens to music to facilitate focus on the psychedelic experience, with the therapeutic team interrupting only to provide reassurance if adverse effects such as anxiety or disorientation arise.

As of 2022, the body of high-quality evidence on psychedelic therapy remains relatively small and more, larger studies are needed to reliably show the effectiveness and safety of psychedelic therapy&#x27;s various forms and applications. On the basis of favorable early results, ongoing research is examining proposed psychedelic therapies for conditions including major depressive disorder, anxiety and depression linked to terminal illness, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The United States Food and Drug Administration has granted &quot;breakthrough therapy&quot; status, which expedites the potential approval of promising drug therapies, to psychedelic therapies using psilocybin (for treatment-resistant depression and major depressive disorder) and MDMA (for post-traumatic stress disorder).

==History==

===Prehistoric use of psychedelic substances===
Humans have long consumed psychedelic substances derived from cacti, seeds, bark, and roots of various plants and fungi. Since ancient times, shamans and medicine men have used psychedelics as a way to gain access to the spirit world. Though western culture usually views the practice of shamans and medicine men as predominantly spiritual in nature, elements of psychotherapeutic practice can be read into the entheogenic or shamanic rituals of many cultures.

===Research in the mid-20th century===

Shortly after Albert Hofmann discovered the psychoactive properties of LSD in 1943, Sandoz Laboratories began widespread distribution of LSD to researchers in 1949. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, scientists in several countries (e.g., U.S.A.: Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute, MKUltra) conducted extensive research into experimental chemotherapeutic and psychotherapeutic uses of psychedelic drugs. In addition to spawning six international conferences and the release of dozens of books, over 1,000 peer-reviewed clinical papers detailing the use of psychedelic compounds (administered to approximately 40,000 patients) were published by the mid-1960s. Proponents believed that psychedelic drugs facilitated psychoanalytic processes, making them particularly useful for patients with conditions such as alcoholism that are otherwise difficult to treat. However, many of these trials did not meet the methodological standards that are required today.

Researchers like Timothy Leary felt psychedelics could alter the fundamental personality structure or subjective value-system of an individual to great potential benefit. Beginning in 1961, he conducted experiments with prison inmates in an attempt to reduce recidivism with short, intense psychotherapy sessions. Participants were administered psilocybin during these sessions weeks apart with regular group therapy sessions in between. Psychedelic therapy was also applied in a number of other specific patient populations including individuals with alcoholism, children with autism, and persons with terminal illness.

===Regulation and prohibition in the late 20th century===
Throughout the 1960s, concerns raised about the proliferation of unauthorized use of psychedelic drugs by the general public (and, most notably, the counterculture) resulted in the imposition of increasingly severe restrictions on medical and psychiatric research conducted with psychedelic substances. Many countries either banned LSD outright or made it extremely scarce, and, bowing to governmental concerns, Sandoz halted production of LSD in 1965. During a congressional hearing in 1966, Senator Robert F. Kennedy questioned the shift of opinion, stating, &quot;Perhaps to some extent we have lost sight of the fact that (LSD) can be very, very helpful in our society if used properly.&quot; In 1968, Dahlberg and colleagues published an article in the &quot;American Journal of Psychiatry&quot; detailing various forces that had successfully discredited legitimate LSD research. The essay argues that individuals in government and the pharmaceutical industry sabotaged the psychedelic research community by canceling ongoing studies and analysis while labeling genuine scientists as charlatans.

Studies on medicinal applications of psychedelics ceased entirely in the United States when the Controlled Substances Act was passed in 1970. LSD and many other psychedelics were placed into the most restrictive &quot;Schedule I&quot; category by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration. Schedule I compounds are claimed to possess &quot;a high potential for abuse and the potential to create severe psychological and/or physical dependence&quot; and have &quot;no currently accepted medical use&quot;, effectively rendering them illegal to use in the United States for all purposes. Despite objections from the scientific community, authorized research into therapeutic applications of psychedelic drugs had been discontinued worldwide by the 1980s.

Despite broad prohibition, unofficial psychedelic research and therapeutic sessions continued nevertheless in the following decades. Some therapists exploited windows of opportunity preceding scheduling of particular psychedelic drugs. Informal psychedelic therapy was conducted clandestinely in underground networks consisting of sessions carried out both by licensed therapists and autodidacts within the community. Due to the largely illegal nature of psychedelic therapy in this period, little information is available concerning the methods that were used. Individuals having published information between 1980 and 2000 regarding psychedelic psychotherapy include George Greer, Ann and Alexander Shulgin (&quot;PiHKAL&quot; and &quot;TiHKAL&quot;), Myron Stolaroff (&quot;The Secret Chief&quot;, regarding the underground therapy done by Leo Zeff), and Athanasios Kafkalides.

===Resurgence in the early 21st century===

In the early 2000s, a renewal of interest in the psychiatric use of psychedelics contributed to an increase in clinical research centering on the psychopharmacological effects of these drugs and their subsequent applications. Advances in science and technology allowed researchers to collect and interpret extensive data from animal studies, and the advent of new technologies such as PET and MRI scanning made it possible to examine the sites of action of hallucinogens in the brain. Furthermore, retrospective studies involving users of illicit drugs as voluntary subjects were conducted, allowing data to be collected on how psychedelics affect the human brain while simultaneously sidestepping bureaucratic difficulties associated with providing illegal substances to subjects. The new century also ushered in a broader change in political attitude towards psychedelic medicine—specifically within the Food and Drug Administration. Curtis Wright, then deputy director of the FDA Division of Anesthetic, Critical Care and Addiction Drugs explained a motivation for this change: &quot;the agency was challenged legally in a number of cases and also underwent a process of introspection, asking &#x27;Is it proper to treat this class of drugs differently?&#x27;&quot;

As of 2014, global treaties listing LSD and psilocybin as &quot;Schedule I&quot; controlled substances continues to inhibit a better understanding of these drugs. Much of the renewed clinical research has been conducted with psilocybin and MDMA in the United States with special permission and breakthrough therapy designations by the FDA, while other studies have investigated the mechanisms and effects of ayahuasca and LSD. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is being actively researched by MAPS.

As of 2023, many new centers for psychedelics research have been launched, including the Centre for Psychedelic Research at Imperial College London, the UC Berkeley Center for the Science of Psychedelics, the Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research at Johns Hopkins University, the Center for Psychedelic Research and Therapy at Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin, the Center for Psychedelic Psychotherapy and Trauma Research at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, the Psychae Institute in Melbourne, and the Naut sa mawt Center for Psychedelic Research at Vancouver Island University. Harvard will create a Study of Psychedelics in Society and Culture.

A survey published in 2023 found strong support for psychedelic therapy among psychiatrists in the United States, revealing a significant positive shift in attitudes toward this treatment modality in comparison to a previous survey published in 2018. More than half of psychiatrists in the 2023 study expressed intentions to incorporate psychedelic therapy into their practice if regulatory approval is granted. In Australia, authorised psychiatrists can prescribe psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression, and MDMA for post-traumatic stress disorder.

In 2024, an FDA advisory panel voted against approving MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD, &quot;raising questions about the credibility of the research being conducted and the safety of those involved in the trials&quot;. The FDA advisors voted 9-2 that the available data didn’t show MDMA was effective in treating PTSD, and 10-1 that the benefits of MDMA-assisted therapy did not outweigh the risks.

In 2025, PsychedeliCare launched a European Citizens’ Initiative aiming to enable the implementation of psychedelic-assisted therapies in the EU to ensure safe and affordable psychedelic-assisted therapies.

==Applications==
Psychedelic substances which may have therapeutic uses include psilocybin (the main active compound found in &quot;magic&quot; mushrooms), mescaline (the main active compound in the peyote cactus), and LSD. Although the history behind these substances has hindered research into their potential medicinal value, scientists are now able to conduct studies and renew research that was halted in the 1970s. Some research has shown that these substances have helped people with such mental disorders as obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcoholism, depression, and cluster headaches. Some of the well known particular psychedelic substances that have been used to this day are: LSD, DMT, psilocybin, mescaline, 2C-B, 2C-I, 5-MeO-DMT, AMT, ibogaine, and DOM. In general, the mechanism of action of how these drugs have therapeutic effects is poorly understood. Their effects are strongly dependent on the environment in which they are given and on the recipient&#x27;s state of mind (set and setting).

===In substance use disorders===
Studies by Humphry Osmond, Betty Eisner, and others examined the possibility that psychedelic therapy could treat alcoholism (or, less commonly, other addictions). Bill Wilson, the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, used LSD during supervised experiments with Betty Eisner, Gerald Heard, and Aldous Huxley. He ingested LSD for the first time on August 29, 1956. With Wilson&#x27;s invitation, his wife Lois, his spiritual adviser Father Ed Dowling, and Nell Wing also participated in experimentation of this drug. Later Wilson wrote to Carl Jung, praising the results and recommending it as validation of Jung&#x27;s spiritual experience. According to Wilson, the session allowed him to re-experience a spontaneous spiritual experience he had had years before, which had enabled him to overcome his own alcoholism.

A 1998 review of the effectiveness of psychedelic therapy for treating alcoholism concluded that due to methodological difficulties in the research prior to that time, it was not possible to state whether it was effective. A 2012 meta-analysis found that &quot;In a pooled analysis of six randomized controlled clinical trials, a single dose of LSD had a significant beneficial effect on alcohol misuse at the first reported follow-up assessment, which ranged from 1 to 12 months after discharge from each treatment program. This treatment effect from LSD on alcohol misuse was also seen at 2 to 3 months and at 6 months, but was not statistically significant at 12 months post-treatment. Among the three trials that reported total abstinence from alcohol use, there was also a significant beneficial effect of LSD at the first reported follow-up, which ranged from 1 to 3 months after discharge from each treatment program.&quot;

In 2022 a systematic review was published on the efficacy of ibogaine/noribogaine, an indole alkaloid with “anti-addictive” properties, to treat substance use disorders looking at studies up to December 2020. Oral ingestion of ibogaine leads to an intense psychedelic experience with effects lasting up to 72 hours that lead participants to insights that may change the way they view life and their ways of thinking; however, the mechanism of how this drug works to reduce substance use is not yet understood. Evidence suggests that ibogaine does have some reduction on opioid and cocaine misuse, but more well designed, larger randomly controlled trials are required to fully understand the therapeutic benefits. Significant adverse reactions were experienced by participants including cardiotoxicity, QT prolongation, ataxia, psychosis, and several fatalities were reported due to toxic adverse events. Analysis of the fatalities concluded that patients with cardiac comorbidities and that those that are taking concurrent medications are at higher risk of a medical emergency.

A systematic review completed in 2023, containing studies from the past decade, looked at the ability of psychedelic therapy in combination with psychotherapy to help reduce substance use, cravings, and abstinence of addictions including alcohol, cocaine, opioids, and nicotine. Studies commonly reported reductions in substance misuse, however, the quality of evidence is too low to draw solid conclusions on the efficacy of psychedelic treatments for substance use disorders.

However, a systematic review of human and animal studies showed that a single dose of LSD for treatment of AUD led to greater odds of improvement in alcohol consumption than control participants.

===In terminal illness===
During the early 1950s and 1960s the National Institute of Mental Health sponsored the study of psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin and LSD to alleviate the debilitating anxiety and depression patients with terminal diagnoses may feel. While these early studies are hard to find, the resurgence of interest in psychedelic drugs to treat humans end of life mindset has led to some small studies in the 21st century. The more recently published research strengthens the findings from the 1950s and 1960s showing the drug is extremely effective in reducing anxiety and depression in this patient population once carefully screened and has few adverse effects when administered in a psychotherapy setting and under medical supervision. The psychologists leading psychedelic drug therapy trials found that end of life patients often experience the emotional turmoil of dying more than the physical aspects. This mindset makes it difficult for patients to find meaning and enjoyment in life during their last few months or years. While all patients have completely different experiences on these mind altering drugs the research subjects interviewed all expressed they had, &quot;heightened clarity and confidence about their personal values and priorities, and a renewed or enhanced recognition of intrinsic meaning and value of life.&quot; More recently, researchers have argued that psychedelic therapy is beneficial for these patients because it may specifically reduce their fear of dying.

As of 2016, Johns Hopkins University and New York University have conducted large randomized, placebo-controlled studies. These two studies are some of the first large controlled studies measuring the effects of psychedelic therapy on depression and anxiety in cancer patients. Across clinician-ratings and self-ratings, the psychedelic treatment produced statistically significant lowered anxiety and depression, with sustenance for at least 6 months. The studies monitored for adverse effects from the drugs but no serious adverse effects were observed. Both studies also attributed the efficacy in part to patients experiencing a &quot;mystical experience&quot;. A mystical experience is a very personal introspective experience where some sort of unity or transcendence of time and space is described. More research is necessary to expand generalizability of the conclusions. Also, more research is necessary to understand the biological properties of a mystical experience.

Evidence is growing for the use of atypical psychedelics such as ketamine for treating depression in terminally ill patients, with repeated IV administration having the most therapeutic effect. These studies did not have any patients experience any serious adverse effects; however, ketamine-induced ulcerative cystitis is a concern for repeated long-term administration. Qualitative studies are required to better understand the mechanism and thought process changes that lead to therapeutic outcomes.

===In post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)===

The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) is conducting studies in the psychedelic treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. The Phase 2 trials of these studies, conducted in the U.S., Canada, and Israel, consisted of 107 participants who had chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD, and had had PTSD for an average of 17.8 years. Out of the 107 participants, 61% no longer qualified for PTSD after three sessions of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy two months after the treatment. At the 12-month follow-up session, 68% no longer had PTSD. Phase 2 trials conducted between 2004 and 2010 reported an overall remission rate of 66.2% and low rates of adverse effects for subjects with chronic PTSD. In 2017, MAPS and the FDA reached an agreement on the special protocol for phase 3 trials.

Evidence shows that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy versus control shows clinically significant improvement in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) scores from baseline, with most of the patients no longer meeting the CAPS score for PTSD. Effects of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy can be observed up to 12 months after receiving 2-3 active sessions of moderate to high dose MDMA (75–125 mg).
It is important to note that given the difficulties with appropriate blinding in trials of MDMA- and psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy the results are likely overestimated. Furthermore, there are no superiority or non-inferiority clinical trials comparing MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to already existent evidence-based treatments for PTSD, but given the effects reported in clinical trials of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD there is no reason to believe that this treatment modality is more effective than existent trauma-focused psychological treatments.

In 2024, an FDA advisory panel voted against approving MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD, &quot;raising questions about the credibility of the research being conducted and the safety of those involved in the trials&quot;. The FDA advisors voted 9-2 that the available data didn’t show MDMA was effective in treating PTSD, and 10-1 that the benefits of MDMA-assisted therapy did not outweigh the risks.

===In depressive and anxiety disorders===
In 2019, the FDA approved the use of esketamine for intranasal use for major depressive disorder (MDD) and treatment-resistant depression (TRD), in conjunction with an oral antidepressant.

Also in 2019, the FDA granted &quot;breakthrough therapy&quot; status to psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression and major depressive disorder in order to hasten the process for potential regulatory approval. The designation of &quot;breakthrough therapy&quot; fast-tracks the study of drugs where preliminary clinical evidence shows that they could be substantially more effective than therapies that are already available.

Studies on the clinical effects of ayahuasca have found significant antidepressant and anxiety-reducing effects, leading to calls for further research to overcome methodological limitations in the existing studies.

There is some evidence that psilocybin in combination with MDMA might help with psychiatric disorders, but only when administered in a controlled clinical setting.

There is limited evidence that reductions in suicidality scores can be observed immediately after administration of ayahuasca or psilocybin, observable up to 6 months after administration.

===In reducing criminal behavior===
In 2017, researchers mainly from the University of Birmingham published research suggesting that psilocybin use is correlated with reduced criminal behavior. The researchers analyzed data from 480,000 U.S. adults collected by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health on their past use of psychedelics, including ayahuasca, dimethyltryptamine, LSD, mescaline, peyote, San Pedro, and psilocybin mushrooms. While other illicit drugs have been associated with increased criminal behavior, the researchers found that psychedelic substances were instead associated with reduced criminal behavior. Usage of these substances was associated with a 12% reduction in likelihood of assault, 18% reduction in likelihood of other violent crimes, 27% reduction in likelihood of committing larceny and theft, and 22% reduction in likelihood of committing other property crimes. These findings potentially support the use of psychedelic therapy in forensic and clinical settings.

In a prior 2014 study, researchers explored the relationship between recidivism and naturalistic hallucinogens in criminal justice populations with a history of substance use. The results concluded that hallucinogens promoted prosocial behaviors in a population which is typically associated with high recidivism rates. The usage of hallucinogens has been found to reduce supervision failure in ex-convicts. This inherently encourages drug abstinence, including the use of alcohol, resulting in lower rates of recidivism.

A 2018 study found that men who had used psychedelic drugs in the past were less likely to commit violence against their current partners compared to those who had not used these substances. The study suggests that the use of psychedelic drugs in men might be associated with a reduced likelihood of committing violence against intimate partners, potentially due to improved emotion regulation.

A 2022 U.S. study found that use of classic psychedelics was associated with lowered odds of criminal arrest. The research suggests that 7 of the 11 arrest variables were reduced with lifetime psilocybin use. Peyote use was found to reduce the odds of driving under the influence and vehicle theft. Lastly, mescaline use was found to reduce drug possession/sale. No other substances shared a positive relationship with reducing criminal behavior.

==Contraindications==
Psychedelic therapy is contraindicated for people who:
* are pregnant,
* have a history of epilepsy/other seizure disorder,
* have severe cardiovascular disease including uncontrolled blood pressure, heart failure, coronary artery disease, or previous heart attack or stroke,
* use medications like SSRI or MAO-I antidepressants,
* have a personal or family history of primary psychotic or affective disorders like schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, Bipolar I disorder, or psychotic symptoms in the setting of depression.

==Methods==
===Standard psychedelic therapy===
The main approach used in the contemporary resurgence of research, often simply called &quot;psychedelic therapy&quot;, involves the use of moderate-to-high doses of psychedelic drugs. The psychedelic therapy method was initiated by Humphry Osmond and Abram Hoffer (with some influence from Al Hubbard) and replicated by Keith Ditman, and is more closely aligned to transpersonal psychology than to traditional psychoanalysis. Most recent research on psychedelic therapy has used psilocybin or ayahuasca.

Patients spend most of the acute period of the drug&#x27;s activity lying down with eyeshades listening to music selected beforehand and exploring their inner experience. Dialogue with the therapists the drug session(s) but essential during the preparation session before and the integration session afterwards. The therapeutic team normally consists of a man and a woman, who are both present throughout the psychedelic experience. One aspect that occurs in most participants undergoing psychedelic therapy with moderate-to-high doses is transcendental, mystical, or peak experiences. Research has suggested that the strength of these experiences, together with discussion of them soon after in a therapeutic session, could be a major determinant of how great the longer-term effects on symptoms will be.

Some studies of psychedelic therapy have incorporated cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or motivational enhancement therapy (MET). Within a structured CBT intervention and a dose of psilocybin, patients are given the opportunity to experience cognitive and emotional states that are altered. With these psychedelic effects, cognitive reframing of detrimental schemas and self-identity can be modified positively.

In a MET environment, patients are able to reflect on their own behaviors to make changes in problematic manners, such as alcohol use disorder. Additionally, it could potentially enhance motivation to change and decrease possible ambivalence about behavioral changes. Within psychedelic drug sessions, through a reevaluation of the concept of self and reconnecting with core beliefs and values, this can be achieved.

Psychedelic-assisted group psychotherapy can be more cost-efficient, because therapists can split the costs among all participants of the group.

===Psycholytic therapy===
Psycholytic therapy involves the use of low-to-medium doses of psychedelic drugs, repeatedly at intervals of 1–2 weeks. The therapist is present during the peak of the experience to assist the patient in processing material that arises and to offer support. This general form of therapy was mostly used to treat patients with neurotic and psychosomatic disorders. The name psycholytic therapy was coined by Ronald A. Sandison, literally meaning &quot;soul-dissolving&quot;, refers to the belief that the therapy can dissolve conflicts in the mind. Psycholytic therapy was historically an important approach to psychedelic psychotherapy in Europe, and was also practiced in the United States by some psychotherapists, including Betty Eisner. In the time since the 1970s, psycholytic therapy has not been a focus of research.

Psychedelic drugs are useful for exploring the subconscious because a conscious sliver of the adult ego usually remains active during the experience. Patients remain intellectually alert throughout the process and remember their experiences vividly afterward. In this highly introspective state, patients are actively aware of ego defenses such as projection, denial, and displacement as they react to themselves and their choices.

The ultimate goal of the therapy is to provide a safe, mutually compassionate context through which the profound and intense reliving of memories can be filtered through the principles of genuine psychotherapy. Aided by the deeply introspective state attained by the patient, the therapist assists him/her in developing a new life framework or personal philosophy that recognizes individual responsibility for change.

In Germany, Hanscarl Leuner designed a form of psycholytic therapy, which was developed officially but was also used by some socio-politically motivated underground therapists in the 1970s.

In Switzerland, Friedericke Meckel Fisher (trained by Stanislav Grof in Breathwork and Samuel Widmer in group psychedelic sessions) practiced group psycholytic therapy mainly from the early 2000s and until 2015. Meckel Fischer developed her own system of psycholytic therapy which she conducted underground, in group weekend sessions of 15 to 19 people, using medium dosages of psychedelic substances. She added and combined into this psycholytic group work, techniques of her own modified family constellation work, cathartic body work, evocative music, and periods of sharing and feedback within the group.

===Other variations===

====Claudio Naranjo====
The Chilean therapist Claudio Naranjo developed a branch of psychedelic therapy that utilized drugs like MDA, MDMA, harmaline, and ibogaine.

====Anaclitic therapy====
The term &quot;&quot; (from the Ancient Greek &quot;ἀνάκλιτος&quot;, &quot;anaklitos&quot; – &quot;for reclining&quot;) refers to primitive, infantile needs and tendencies directed toward a pre-genital love object. Developed by two London psychoanalysts, Joyce Martin and Pauline McCririck, this form of treatment is similar to psycholytic approaches as it is based largely on a psychoanalytic interpretation of abreactions produced by the treatment, but it tends to focus on those experiences in which the patient re-encounters carnal feelings of emotional deprivation and frustration stemming from the infantile needs of their early childhood. As a result, the treatment was developed with the aim to directly fulfill or satisfy those repressed, agonizing cravings for love, physical contact, and other instinctual needs re-lived by the patient. Therefore, the therapist is completely engaged with the subject, as opposed to the traditional detached attitude of the psychoanalyst. With the intense emotional episodes that came with the psychedelic experience, Martin and McCririck aimed to sit in as the &quot;mother&quot; role who would enter into close physical contact with the patients by rocking them, giving them milk from a bottle, etc.

====Hypnodelic therapy====
Hypnodelic therapy, as the name suggests, was developed with the goal to maximize the power of hypnotic suggestion by combining it with the psychedelic experience. After training the patient to respond to hypnosis, LSD would be administered, and during the onset phase of the drug the patient would be placed into a state of trance. Levine and Ludwig found the combination of these techniques to be more effective than the use of either of these two components separately.

==Public interest==
A resurgence of public interest in psychedelic drug therapy in the 21st century has been driven in part by articles in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

===Psychedelic tourism===

The first article to bring attention to the uses of psychedelic drugs for mental health was titled, &quot;Seeking the Magic Mushroom&quot;, written by Robert Gordon Wasson and published in 1957 by &quot;TIME&quot; magazine. It detailed his experience traveling to Oaxaca, Mexico, and taking &quot;magic mushrooms&quot; (psilocybin) within the cultural practices that started the &quot;trip&quot; experience. Since that time, there has been growing interest within the United States to travel for these unique psychedelic experiences. The market for psychedelic tourism is currently growing rapidly. While typically the vacation destinations for psychedelics are based in Central and South America, there is a rise in western culture taking over their traditional practices. In the Netherlands, there are psychedelic society retreats ranging in cost from $500–1200 that center on a ceremony in which tourists take magic mushrooms and trip together for around six hours. There are also underground psychedelic &quot;guides&quot; popping up around the United States that include leaders who claim to assist people through their trip similar to shamans in other cultures. An article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; entitled &quot;Welcome to the trip of your life: the rise of underground LSD guides&quot; details various styles of guides that can be found within the United States.

===Psilocybin therapy===
Psilocybin therapy is the use of psilocybin (the psychoactive ingredient in psilocybin mushrooms) in treating a range of mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, addictions, obsessive compulsive disorder, and psychosis.

As of January 1, 2023, psilocybin services facilitator training is available for individuals aged 21 and above who are Oregon residents. To become a psilocybin facilitator, an individual must complete a 120-hour regulated facilitator course, after which they may guide a client through a psilocybin experience. The facilitator may not engage the client in therapy; the therapeutic sessions held before and after the psilocybin experience itself are held by a psychotherapist. As of March 2023, there are currently graduates who can practice as licensed facilitators; however, no licensed service centers are yet operating.

<text>The International League (IL) is a Minor League Baseball league that operates in the United States at the Triple-A level, which is one grade below Major League Baseball. A champion has been determined at the end of each season since the league was formed in 1884. 

Through 1932, champions were usually the regular-season pennant winners—the team with the best win–loss record at the conclusion of the season. From 1933 to 2020, postseason playoffs were held to determine champions. Participants from 1933 to 1987 were usually the four teams with the highest winning percentages. From 1988 to 2020, the four qualifiers were the division winners and one or two wild card teams. The winner of each season&#x27;s playoffs was awarded the Governors&#x27; Cup. These playoffs and the issuing of trophy were discontinued in 2021, when the winner was the team with the best regular-season record. In 2022, the league championship was determined by a single playoff game between the East and West division winners. Beginning with the 2023 season, the league adopted a split season format, in which the league championship is determined by a best-of-three playoff series between the winners of each half of the season, with the winner meeting the champion of the Pacific Coast League in the Triple-A National Championship Game.

The Rochester Red Wings have won 19 International League championships, more than any other team, followed by the Columbus Clippers (11) and the Baltimore Orioles, original Buffalo Bisons, and Toronto Maple Leafs (10). Among active IL franchises, Rochester has won 19 championships, the most of all teams, followed by Columbus (11) and the Durham Bulls and Syracuse Mets (8). During the era of the Governors&#x27; Cup playoffs from 1933 to 2020, the most cup titles were won by Columbus (11), followed by Rochester (10) and Syracuse (8).

==History==
===Pre-playoff era (1884–1932)===

The International League was founded in 1884. The modern circuit traces its roots from several predecessor leagues: the Eastern League (1884), New York State League (1885), International League (1886–1887), International Association (1888–1890), Eastern Association (1891), and Eastern League (1892–1911). It adopted consistent use of the International League name in 1912. After the cancellation of the 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the league was known as the Triple-A East in 2021 before reverting to the International League moniker in 2022.

A league champion has been determined at the end of each season. With few exceptions, champions from 1884 to 1932 were simply the regular-season pennant winners—the team with the best win–loss record at the conclusion of the regular championship season. The first league champions were the Trenton Trentonians, who won by four games over the Lancaster Ironsides in 1884. The 1891 and 1892 seasons were contested as split seasons or &quot;double seasons&quot;. Under this format, the schedule was split into two parts. The team with the best record at the end of the first season won the first pennant. Standings were then reset so that all clubs had clean records to begin the second season. If the same team won both seasons, they were declared the league champion. This was the case in 1891 when the original Buffalo Bisons won both halves. If a different team won the second season, the two winners would meet in a playoff series to determine the champion. This happened in 1892 when the Binghamton Bingoes, winners of the second season, defeated the Providence Clamdiggers, winners of the first season, four games to two. In 1932, the Newark Bears became the last team to win the championship by virtue of winning the regular-season pennant before a recurring series of playoffs were instituted.

===Governors&#x27; Cup era (1933–2020)===

Frank Shaughnessy, general manager of the International League&#x27;s Montreal Royals, was interested in developing a way for multiple clubs to share in the excitement of postseason play. His new playoff format, devised to maintain the interest of fans and players alike during the Great Depression, provided an opportunity for four teams to compete for the league&#x27;s championship. In 1933, he introduced his plan to league president Charles H. Knappe, and the result was the Governors&#x27; Cup playoffs. Several other leagues noticed the success of the &quot;Shaughnessy Plan&quot; and began using the system as well.

The governors of Maryland, New Jersey, and New York and the lieutenant governors of the provinces of Quebec and Ontario, in which the league&#x27;s eight teams were located at the time, sponsored a trophy to be awarded annually to the winner of the International League playoffs. The original trophy, designed by the supervisor of the league&#x27;s umpires and silversmith W. B. Carpenter, was created out of solid silver. In 1988, IL president Harold Cooper donated the trophy to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, where it is on permanent display. A new trophy was minted in its place to be presented to the winner of the Governors&#x27; Cup playoffs.

Under this system, the top four teams in the league, based on winning percentage, competed for the championship. From 1933 to 1987, the first round typically consisted of a best-of-seven-games series between the first and fourth-place teams and a series between the second and third-place teams. The winners of these semifinals then faced one another for the championship in a best-of-seven series. The first Governors&#x27; Cup was won in 1933 by the original Buffalo Bisons, who defeated the Rochester Red Wings, 4–2. Sporadically from 1966 to 1980, one or both rounds were reduced to best-of-five series. From 1981 to 2020, both rounds were the best-of-five.

The IL utilized a divisional alignment for the first time in 1963. The first-place teams from each division, North and South, met in the first round, as did the second-place teams, with the winners meeting in the finals. The circuit reverted to having no divisions in 1964 but returned to the same playoff format with North and South Divisions for 1973 and 1974.

From 1988 to 1991, the International League held an interleague partnership with the American Association, called the Triple-A Alliance, in which they played an interlocking schedule, and the leagues&#x27; champions met in the Triple-A Classic. During this period, the IL was divided into East and West Divisions, and the division winners faced off in a best-of-five series to determine champions. After the dissolution of the Triple-A Alliance following the 1991 season, the International League maintained this divisional alignment but returned to having a semifinal round wherein the top two teams in each division played each other to qualify for the Governors&#x27; Cup finals.

The league was split into three divisions, North, South, and West, from 1998 to 2020. Under this arrangement, the three division winners and a wild card team, the team with the best second-place record, qualified for the playoffs. The best-of-five semifinals pitted the North Division winner against the wild card team, and the South and West Division winners against each other. The winners then played in a best-of-five round to determine the champion. The last team to win the championship this way was the Columbus Clippers, who won the last Governors&#x27; Cup in 2019. The 2020 season was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Current era (2021–present)===
The International League ceased operations before the 2021 season in conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) reorganization of Minor League Baseball. In place of the International League, MLB created the Triple-A East, a circuit divided into three divisions, Northeast, Midwest, and Southeast. Prior to the 2022 season, MLB renamed the Triple-A East the International League, and it carried on the history of the IL prior to reorganization. Rather than hold playoffs for its championship, the Triple-A East&#x27;s 2021 title was awarded to the team with the best regular-season record. The Durham Bulls won this championship by four-and-a-half games ahead of the Buffalo Bisons. 

Along with these changes, all references to the Governors&#x27; Cup as the championship of the International League were discontinued and a different trophy was awarded. In 2022, the league was reorganized in East and West Divisions. Under this alignment, the winners of each division met in a single game to determine the league champion. 

Beginning in 2023, the regular-season was split into two halves, and the winners of each half meet in a best-of-three series for the league championship.

==Early life==
Yagnik was born in Kolkata on 20 March 1966 to a Gujarati family. Her father&#x27;s name is Dharmendra Shankar. Her mother Shubha was a singer of Indian classical music. In 1972 at age six, she started singing for Akashvani (All India Radio), Calcutta. At age 10, her mother brought her to Mumbai as a child singer. She was advised to wait until her voice matured, but her mother remained determined. On a subsequent visit, Yagnik got a letter of introduction to Raj Kapoor from his Kolkata distributor. Kapoor heard the girl and sent her with a letter to noted music director Laxmikant Shantaram Kudalkar. Impressed, Laxmikant gave her two alternatives – an immediate start as a dubbing artist or a later break as a singer; Shubha chose the latter for her daughter. Yagnik mentioned that she was a bright student but didn&#x27;t like studies.

==Career==
Trained in the classical style, Yagnik began singing &quot;Bhajans&quot; for Akashvani (All India Radio), Calcutta at the age of six. Her first song was for the film &quot;Payal Ki Jhankaar&quot; in (1980). This was followed by &quot;Laawaris&quot; (1981) with the song &quot;Mere Angane Mein&quot;, followed by the film &quot;Hamari Bahu Alka&quot; (1982). She got her big break with the song &quot;Ek Do Teen&quot; from the film &quot;Tezaab&quot; (1988). She has said that she had a high fever on the day she recorded &quot;Ek Do Teen&quot;.

Also, her song &quot;Choli Ke Peeche&quot; from the movie Khalnayak was voted as the hottest song of the century in a poll conducted by Sanona.

Yagnik has also been involved in various projects to empower girls. In 2014, Yagnik again teamed up with Sonu Nigam to sing the song &quot;Phool Khil Jayenge&quot; for child health awareness. She also sang a song titled &quot;Maine Li Jo Angdai&quot; for the album &quot;Women&#x27;s Day Special: Spreading Melodies Everywhere&quot;. It was composed by Farid Sabri, Harish Chauhan, and Gurudatt Sahil; and penned by Sudhakar Sharma.

<text>The Democracy and Boundary Commission Cymru () is a Welsh Government sponsored body, responsible for defining local government boundaries and Senedd constituency boundaries in Wales, also known as .

The Commission was established originally as the Local Government Boundary Commission for Wales () in 1972 under the Local Government Act 1972. Its purpose is to: keep under review all local government areas in Wales, and the electoral arrangements for the principal areas, and to make such proposals to the Welsh Government as seem desirable in the interests of effective and convenient local government. The work of the Commission was modified by the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994.

Electoral arrangements in six authorities were reviewed after the penultimate round of Welsh local elections in 1999, and the changes were implemented at the elections on 10 June 2004. In 2002, the commission also reviewed and amended some of the boundaries of the preserved counties of Wales.

In February 2009 the Minister for Local government and Social Justice issued Directions to the commission to begin an Electoral Review across all the 22 local authorities in Wales. His stated aim was to rationalise representation at &quot;... no lower than a ratio of 1 councillor to 1,750 electors &quot;.

The name and functioning of the commission was changed in 2013 to the Local Democracy and Boundary Commission for Wales (), as a result of the Local Government (Democracy) (Wales) Act 2013. It was renamed again by the Senedd Cymru (Members and Elections) Act 2024 to its current name and given responsibility over reviewing the borders of Senedd constituencies.

As part of electoral reform in the Senedd it will create 16 new constituencies by pairing the 32 Westminster constituencies, these are to be used in the next Senedd election in 2026. Following that election the Commission will conduct a full review of Senedd boundaries and do so every 8 years.

<doc id="665341" wikidata="Q2754911" url="?curid=665341" title="Orders of magnitude (data)">
<text>The order of magnitude of data may be specified in strictly standards-conformant units of information and multiples of the bit and byte with decimal scaling, or using historically common usages of a few multiplier prefixes in a binary interpretation which has been common in computing until new binary prefixes were defined in the 1990s..

==Units of measure==
The byte has been a commonly used unit of measure for much of the information age to refer to a number of bits. In the early days of computing, it was used for differing numbers of bits based on convention and computer hardware design, but today means 8 bits. A more accurate, but less commonly used name for 8 bits is octet.

Commonly, a decimal SI metric prefix (such as kilo-) is used with bit and byte to express larger sizes (kilobit, kilobyte). But, this is usually inaccurate since these prefixes are decimal, whereas binary hardware size is usually binary. Customarily, each metric prefix, 1000n, is used to mean a close approximation of a binary multiple, 1024n. Often, this distinction is implicit, and therefore, use of metric prefixes can lead to confusion. The IEC binary prefixes (such as kibi-) allow for accurate description of hardware sizes, but are not commonly used.

==Entropy==
This page references two kinds of entropy which are not entirely equivalent. For comparison, the Avogadro constant is entities per mole, based upon the number of atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12 isotope. See Entropy in thermodynamics and information theory.
* Entropy (information theory), such as the amount of information that can be stored in DNA
* Entropy (thermodynamics), such as entropy increase of 1 mole of water

<text>The Pacific Coast League (PCL) is a Minor League Baseball league that operates in the United States at the Triple-A level, which is one grade below Major League Baseball. A champion has been determined at the end of each season since the league was formed in 1903. 

Through 1927, champions were usually the regular-season pennant winners—the team with the best win–loss record at the conclusion of the regular season. From 1928 to 1954, postseason playoffs were the predominant method of determining champions. Participants from 1936 to 1954 were the four teams with the highest winning percentages. After a period of postseason dormancy, the playoffs returned in 1963 along with the advent of a divisional alignment. From 1963 to 1977, the winners of each of two divisions vied for the championship. The league operated using a split season format from 1978 to 1997, with the winners of each half facing off for the right to play for the PCL crown. From 1998 to 2020, the league was split into two conferences of two divisions each. The division winners within each conference met to determine conference champions, and those winners competed for the league championship. The 2021 winner was the team with the best regular-season record. In 2022, the league championship was determined by a single playoff game between the East and West division winners. Beginning with the 2023 season, the league adopted a split season format, in which the league championship is determined by a best-of-three playoff series between the winners of each half of the season, with the winner meeting the champion of the International League in the Triple-A National Championship Game.

The San Francisco Seals won 14 Pacific Coast League championships, more than any other team, followed by the Los Angeles Angels (12) and the Albuquerque Dukes and Portland Beavers (8). Among active PCL franchises, the Tacoma Rainiers have seven championships, the most of all teams, followed by the Sacramento River Cats (5) and the Oklahoma City Comets (3).

==History==

===Pre-playoff era (1903–1927)===

The Pacific Coast League was founded in 1903. A league champion has been determined at the end of each season. With few exceptions, champions from 1903 to 1927 were simply the regular-season pennant winners—the team with the best win–loss record at the conclusion of the regular championship season. The first league champions were the Los Angeles Angels, who won by  games over the Sacramento Senators in 1903.

The 1904 and 1905 seasons were contested as split seasons. Under this format, the schedule was split into two parts. The team with the best record at the end of the first season won the first pennant. Standings were then reset so that all clubs had clean records to begin the second season. If the first season winner also won the second season, they were declared the league champion. If a different team won the second season, the two winners would meet in a playoff series to determine the champion. The Tacoma Tigers, winners of the first half of the 1904 season, won the first PCL playoff championship by defeating Los Angeles, who tied with Tacoma for the best record in the second half, 5–4–1, in a best-of-ten-games series. Roles were reversed in 1904 as Los Angeles bested Tacoma, 5–1.

The only other playoffs during this period occurred in 1918. After two PCL cities, San Francisco and Salt Lake City, passed &quot;work or fight&quot; laws to aid the effort to win World War I, league directors voted to suspend the season after the games of July 14. A postseason series between the first-place Vernon Tigers and second-place Los Angeles was held to decide the champion. Los Angeles won, 4–2.

===Rise and fall of the Governors&#x27; Cup (1928–1962)===

Playoffs were held briefly from 1928 to 1931, again involving a split season with the winners of each half meeting in a best-of-seven series to determine champions. In 1928, the San Francisco Seals defeated the Sacramento Senators, 4–2, to win the first Governors&#x27; Cup. The Seals and future winners of the playoffs were awarded a trophy cup named in recognition of the three states with PCL teams at the time: California, Oregon, and Washington. The league returned to recognizing pennant winners as champions from 1932 to 1935.

The Governors&#x27; Cup playoffs were revived and expanded from 1936 to 1954. Utilizing the Shaughnessy playoff system, the top four teams in the league, based on winning percentage, competed for the championship. The first round typically consisted of a best-of-seven series between the first and fourth-place teams and a series between the second and third-place teams. The winners of these semifinals then faced one another for the championship in a best-of-seven series. The first four-team Governors&#x27; Cup was won in 1933 by the Portland Beavers, who defeated the Oakland Oaks, 4–1. Financial problems resulted in the cancellation of the playoffs in 1950, 1952, and 1953 and the shortening of the final round to best-of-three series in 1951 and 1954. The last Governors&#x27; Cup, awarded in 1954, was won by Oakland, who swept San Francisco for the title.

Postseason play and the awarding of the Governors&#x27; Cup was discontinued from 1955 to 1962. During this time, regular-season pennant winner were declared champions. The trophy itself was placed in the Helms Athletic Foundation Museum in Los Angeles in 1954, sold to a collector when the museum closed, and was subsequently stolen. A number of other trophies have been awarded to championship teams in later years during which postseason play occurred. The one given in the 1980s and early 1990s was four feet tall and incorporated three full-size baseball bats and a glove. One design from the mid-1990s resembled Major League Baseball&#x27;s Commissioner&#x27;s Trophy issued to World Series champions. From 1998 to 2019, the trophy was an engraved glass wedge fixed to a wooden base.

===Divisional era (1963–present)===

The Pacific Coast League divided its teams into two divisions for the first time in 1963 after absorbing three teams from the former American Association, which had disbanded after the previous season. From 1963 to 1977, the winners of each division met in a best-of-seven series (sometimes five) to determine a champion. The playoffs were expanded to include two wild card teams in 1978. The winners of each division faced the second-place team in their own division, and the winners of these semifinals then played for the PCL championship, with each series being the best-of-five games.

From 1979 to 1997, the PCL adopted a split season format while maintaining its divisional alignment. Typically, the first and second-half champions within each division played a semifinal series to decide division champions. The winners of these then played for the league championship. In some instances, a team that won both halves of the season received a bye into the championship round, while in others the team in that division with the second-place full-season record was awarded a wild-card berth and became the first-place team&#x27;s opponent. The divisional round began as a best-of-three contest, but it was expanded to the best-of-five in 1983. The championship round was usually contested as a best-of-five series, but it became the best-of-seven in some seasons. 

The PCL expanded again in 1998 when the American Association, which had been revived in 1969, dissolved for a final time after the 1997 season. The league was then split into two eight-team conferences consisting of two four-team divisions. The division winners within each conference met in a best-of-five series to determine conference champions. Then, the conference winners played a best-of-five series to decide the league champion.

The 2020 season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Pacific Coast League ceased operations before the 2021 season in conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) reorganization of Minor League Baseball. In place of the league, MLB created the Triple-A West, a circuit divided into two divisions of four teams each. Prior to the 2022 season, MLB renamed the Triple-A West the Pacific Coast League, and it carried on the history of the PCL prior to reorganization. Rather than hold playoffs for its championship, the Triple-A West&#x27;s 2021 title was awarded to the team with the best regular-season record. The Tacoma Rainiers won this championship by two games ahead of the Sugar Land Skeeters. In 2022, the winners of each division, East and West, met in a single game to determine the league champion. Beginning in 2023, the regular-season was split into two halves, and the winners of each half meet in a best-of-three series for the league championship.

<doc id="665354" wikidata="Q946448" url="?curid=665354" title="New Orleans Buccaneers">
<text>The New Orleans Buccaneers were a charter member of the American Basketball Association. After three seasons in New Orleans, Louisiana, the franchise moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where it became the Pros, Tams, and Sounds for four years before an abortive move to Baltimore in 1975.

==Origins==
With the founding of the ABA on February 2, 1967, a charter franchise was awarded to a group of seven investors, including Morton Downey, Jr. The group obtained their franchise for $1,000 as opposed to the $30,000 fronted by most other original teams. Charles G. Smither, one of the seven owners, served as team president; another of the investors, Maurice M. Stern, was operations manager. The team was named the New Orleans Buccaneers and former Mississippi State University head coach Babe McCarthy was signed as its first coach. Among the team&#x27;s first players were Doug Moe, Larry Brown, Gerald Govan, Jimmy Jones and Red Robbins.

==1967–1968 season==
The Buccaneers played their home games at the Loyola University Fieldhouse during their first season and averaged 2,337 fans per game there. Doug Moe, Red Robbins, Larry Brown and Jimmy Jones played in the ABA All Star game and Babe McCarthy coached the West team in the game. Larry Brown was the Most Valuable Player of the inaugural ABA All Star game and led the ABA in assists that season en route to being named Second Team All ABA. Doug Moe was named First Team All ABA and Jimmy Jones made the ABA All Rookie Team. The Buccaneers recruited Jackie Moreland, originally from Minden, who had played for the Detroit Pistons from 1960–1965.

The Buccaneers finished the season in first place in the Western Division with 48 wins and 30 losses, putting them two games ahead of the Dallas Chaparrals and three games ahead of the Denver Rockets. The Buccaneers then defeated the Denver Rockets 3 games to 2 in the Western Division semifinals and then defeated the Dallas Chaparrals 4 games to 1 to win the Western Division championship. The Buccaneers then advanced to the first ever ABA Championship series, facing the Pittsburgh Pipers. The Buccaneers and Pipers split the first six games but the Pipers won the decisive seventh game 122–113 to win the 1968 ABA championship.

==1968–1969 season==
Prior to the season the Buccaneers traded away Larry Brown and Doug Moe to the Oakland Oaks in exchange for Steve Jones and Ron Franz. New Orleans&#x27; Red Robbins and Steve Jones played in the ABA All Star Game. The Buccaneers finished the season with a record of 46 wins and 32 losses which put them in second place in the Western Division, 14 games behind the Oakland Oaks who had posted a remarkable 60-18 (.769) record. The Buccaneers drew an average of 2,834 fans per home game.

The Buccaneers met the Dallas Chaparrals in the Western Division semifinals and prevailed in a close series, 4 games to 3. Advancing to the Western Division finals, the Buccaneers fell to the Oakland Oaks 4 games to none.

==1969–1970 season==
The Buccaneers moved their home games to Tulane Gym (now known as Devlin Fieldhouse) and the Municipal Auditorium for the season. Jimmy Jones suffered a knee injury in December that limited his action for the season; he was still selected to play in the ABA All Star game along with teammates Steve Jones and Gerald Govan. Babe McCarthy again coached the West team.

The Bucs finished at .500 with 42 wins and 42 losses. This placed the team in fifth (last) place in that season&#x27;s highly competitive Western Division, keeping the Buccaneers out of the playoffs. (In the Eastern Division that season that record would have tied them for third place and put them in the playoffs.) For the season, New Orleans averaged 2,599 fans per home game.

==End of tenure in New Orleans==

The team picked up Wendell Ladner in the draft and rechristened itself the Louisiana Buccaneers, planning to play its home games throughout the state during the 1970–1971 season including in New Orleans, Shreveport, Lafayette, Monroe and Baton Rouge. Like most ABA teams, the Bucs were never on strong financial ground, and the move to the smaller Tulane Gym combined with the marked dropoff in their play caused revenue to dry up. It was hoped that becoming a &quot;regional&quot; franchise would provide more capital.

However, on August 21, 1970, the franchise was purchased by a new owner from Mississippi named P. W. Blake, and ten days later, it was moved to Memphis, Tennessee and renamed the Memphis Pros.

The Buccaneers nickname was picked up by a new NFL expansion team in 1976. Since 2002, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and New Orleans Saints have competed against each other in the NFC South division.

On December 10, 2008, in a game against the now Charlotte Hornets, then Charlotte Bobcats, the Buccaneers were for the first time &quot;revived&quot; by the New Orleans Pelicans, then New Orleans Hornets, the city&#x27;s current NBA franchise, who played the game in 1967–68 styled Bucs throwback jerseys. The team&#x27;s cheerleading squad was also dressed in Bucs throwback outfits, Bucs video highlights were played throughout the game, and many of the team&#x27;s past players and coaches were honored at halftime. The Pelicans would win the game 105–89. The Pelicans wore their Buccaneers throwback jerseys once again in a road game against the Cleveland Cavaliers on January 16, 2009, with Cleveland coming out on top 92–78.

<doc id="665363" wikidata="Q7873433" url="?curid=665363" title="USS Rhode Island (1860)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Rhode Island&quot; was a side-wheel steamer in the United States Navy, commissioned in 1861.

&quot;Rhode Island&quot; was built in New York City, in 1860 by Lupton &amp; McDermut as &quot;John P. King&quot;; burned and rebuilt and renamed &quot;Eagle&quot; in 1861 before being purchased by the U.S. Navy on 27 June 1861 from Spofford, Tileston &amp; Company, at New York; renamed &quot;Rhode Island&quot;; and commissioned at New York Navy Yard on 29 July 1861, Commander Stephen D. Trenchard in command.

==Service history==
===Supply ship===
During the American Civil War, &quot;Rhode Island&quot; was employed as a supply ship, visiting various ports and ships with mail, paymasters officers stores, medicine, and other supplies. She departed New York on her first cruise on 31 July 1861, returning on 2 September. While cruising off Galveston, Texas, &quot;Rhode Island&quot; captured the schooner &quot;Venus&quot; attempting to run the blockade with a cargo of lead, copper, tin, and wood. During the remainder of 1861 and 1862 &quot;Rhode Island&quot; continued her essential support duties. Departing Philadelphia on 5 February 1862, she supplied 98 vessels with various stores before returning to Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 18 March; on another trip from 5 April to 20 May 1862 she supplied 118 vessels. Assigned to support the Gulf Blockading Squadron from 17 April 1862, &quot;Rhode Island&quot; chased and forced ashore the British schooner &quot;Richard O&#x27;Bryan&quot; near San Luis Pass on 4 July 1862.

===Loss of USS &quot;Monitor&quot;===

Returning to the north, &quot;Rhode Island&#x27;s&quot; next duties were towing the low-freeboard monitors , , , and south from Hampton Roads to Beaufort, North Carolina, or Port Royal, South Carolina. On 29 December 1862 &quot;Rhode Island&quot; departed Hampton Roads with the famous &quot;Monitor&quot; in tow and &quot;Passaic&quot; in company. As the ships rounded Cape Hatteras on the evening of 30 December, they encountered a heavy storm. &quot;Monitor&quot;″s pumps were unable to control flooding caused by underwater leaks so that the order to abandon ship had to be given. Before &quot;Monitor&quot;″s crew could be completely transferred to &quot;Rhode Island&quot;, the ironclad sank, taking four officers and 12 enlisted men with her. &quot;Rhode Island&quot; endeavored to remain as near as possible to the position in which &quot;Monitor&quot; sank so as to fix the location, some south-southwest of Cape Hatteras and to await daylight to search for a missing small boat. Seven &quot;Rhode Island&quot; crewman were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions during the sinking: Ordinary Seaman Luke M. Griswold, Seaman Lewis A. Horton, Landsman John Jones, Captain of the Afterguard Hugh Logan, Seaman George Moore, Coxswain Charles H. Smith, and Coxswain Maurice Wagg.

===Enforcing the blockade===
On 29 January 1863 &quot;Rhode Island&quot; was ordered to the West Indies to join in the search for the Confederate steamers &quot;Oreto&quot; and &quot;Alabama&quot;. Unable to help locate the Confederate warships, she did succeed in driving the blockade runner &quot;Margaret and Jessie&quot; ashore at Stirrup Cay on 30 May. Continuing her cruising on the Atlantic coast, &quot;Rhode Island&quot; achieved a fourth victory on 16 August when she captured the British blockade runner &quot;Cronstadt&quot; north of Man of War Bay, Abaco, Bahamas with a cargo of cotton, turpentine, and tobacco.

===Conversion to cruiser===
With defective boilers requiring repair, &quot;Rhode Island&quot; entered Boston Navy Yard on 28 March 1864 for overhaul and was decommissioned there on 21 April. Extensive alterations were made transforming &quot;Rhode Island&quot; into an auxiliary cruiser mounting one 11-inch gun, eight 8-inch (203 mm) guns, one 30-pounder (14 kg) Parrott rifle, and one 12-pounder (5 kg) rifle. Ordered to tow the monitor from Boston to New York on 26 September 1864, &quot;Rhode Island&quot; recommissioned on 3 October 1864 and joined the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron soon afterward.

Employed in cruising along Confederate-controlled coasts &quot;Rhode Island&#x27;s&quot; duty was highlighted by the capture of the British blockade runner &quot;Vixen&quot; on 1 December 1864. Sailing from Hampton Roads on 11 December with the monitor in tow, &quot;Rhode Island&quot; joined the squadron attacking Fort Fisher, taking part in the first assault on 24 December and the second, successful attempt of 13–15 January 1865. Signal Quartermaster Charles H. Foy was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Second Battle of Fort Fisher.

Ordered to tow the monitor from Federal Point, North Carolina, to Norfolk, Virginia, on 16 January 1865, &quot;Rhode Island&quot; subsequently cruised in company with the seagoing monitor in March. In May &quot;Rhode Island&quot; made a cruise to Mobile, Alabama, returning to Hampton Roads on 22 May.

Maintained in commission in the years immediately following the end of the Civil War, &quot;Rhode Island&#x27;s&quot; first duty was to help bring the formidable former Confederate armored ram &quot;Stonewall&quot; to the United States. Departing on 21 October for Havana in company with , &quot;Rhode Island&quot; returned with the French-built &quot;Stonewall&quot; on 23 November.

===After the Civil War===
Throughout 1866, &quot;Rhode Island&quot; continued to cruise in the Atlantic and West Indies, from April 1866 flying the flag of Rear Admiral James S. Palmer. On 15 January 1866, Seaman William B. Stacy was awarded the Medal of Honor for rescuing a drowning crewmate while the ship was in the harbor of Cap-Haïtien, Haiti. Calling once at Halifax in 1867 before being decommissioned, &quot;Rhode Island&quot; was sold to G. W. Quintard on 1 October 1867. Redocumented as &quot;Charleston&quot; on 8 November 1867, the side-wheeler remained in merchant service until abandoned in 1885.

<doc id="665369" wikidata="Q6664099" url="?curid=665369" title="Boundaries Scotland">
<text>Boundaries Scotland is an independent body in Scotland created as the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. According to its website, it is responsible for: carrying out reviews of boundaries of local authority areas; reviews of electoral arrangements for local authorities; responding to requests for ad hoc reviews of electoral or administrative arrangements; and reviews of constituencies and regions for the Scottish Parliament. Its work relates to the local government of Scotland, and it reports to the Scottish Government. Its counterpart organisations elsewhere in the UK are the Local Government Boundary Commission for England, the Democracy and Boundary Commission Cymru (Wales) and the Local Government Boundaries Commissioner for Northern Ireland.

The Boundary Commission for Scotland is a separate body, concerned with the boundaries of UK parliament constituencies in Scotland.

When section 28 of the Scottish Elections (Reform) Act 2020 came into force, the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland was renamed Boundaries Scotland.

== Electoral reviews ==
In 2006, the Commission completed its Fourth Statutory Review of Electoral Arrangements, as required by the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, producing new wards for use in single transferable vote elections which each return 3 or 4 councillors. These were first used in elections in 2007. The review resulted in a total of 353 wards across Scotland, returning a total of 1222 councillors. A subsequent interim review in 2011 did not change any ward boundaries, but increased the number of councilors to 1223 from May 2012. A fifth review in 2016 resulted in ward boundaries being changed yet again, though some of the proposed were not implemented, such as in Argyll and Bute.

The Commission&#x27;s Third Statutory Review of Electoral Arrangements reported during 1998 and recommended the electoral arrangements for the unitary local authorities introduced in 1996. The Commission&#x27;s Second Review reported between 1992 and 1994, and its Initial Review between 1977 and 1979: both concerned the Region and District local government structure that was then in place.

== Administrative area reviews ==
The Commission has conducted a series of reviews of local authority areas to address situations where development has taken place across local authority boundaries, or where local authority areas established by the 1973 Act did not reflect local preferences. In the words of the 1973 Act, the Commission&#x27;s recommendations are made &quot;in the interests of effective and convenient local government&quot;. Since the establishment of Scotland&#x27;s current 32 unitary councils in 1996, the Commission has conducted 7 such reviews each of which resulted in small changes to the boundaries of authorities to avoid bisecting developed areas.

The 1973 Act gives the Commission powers to conduct wide-ranging reviews of local authority structures in Scotland. However, throughout its existence, Ministers have directed the Commission not to conduct such reviews.

<doc id="665372" wikidata="Q5043550" url="?curid=665372" title="Carmen Possum">
<text>Carmen Possum is a popular 80-line macaronic poem written in a mix of Latin and English and dating to the 19th century. Its author is unknown, but the poem&#x27;s theme and language enable one to surmise that he or she was from the United States of America and was either a teacher or at least a student of Latin.

The title is a multilingual pun: it could be taken to mean &quot;I Can Sing&quot; in Latin, but, as revealed in the text, it is supposed to mean &quot;Song of the Opossum&quot;. However, both interpretations violate Latin grammar.

The poem can be used as a pedagogical device for elementary Latin teaching. The language mix includes vocabulary, morphology (&quot;turnus&quot;) and grammar (&quot;trunkum longum&quot;).

Carmen Possum is also an unpublished musical piece by Normand Lockwood.

==Publication history==

An early version of the poem, with different words, a couple extra lines, and divided into four sections and titled &quot;Tale of a &#x27;Possum&quot;, appeared in a Michigan University publication dated 1867, where it is attributed to Wheaton College. That same version later appeared in an 1886 issue of the University of Virginia magazine &quot;Virginia Spectator&quot;, with the title &quot;The Tale of a &#x27;Possum&quot;; the editors inquired of readers as to the poem&#x27;s authorship.

A version closer to the modern version, attributed to a &quot;Prof. W. W. Legare&quot; of northern Georgia and dated to the 1850s, was featured in a 1914 periodical.

== The poem (modern version) ==
The translation on the right captures the intended reading of each verse.

==Summary in prose==
The poem chronicles the adventures of two boys who go out hunting for an opossum or raccoon on a snowy night, with their Dachshund dog. Although the dog was often mocked for its disproportionate length (&quot;eight spans&quot;, or seventy inches) and love of chasing rabbits, cats, and rats, it performs flawlessly on the night, chasing an opossum into a long, hollow log.

The boys run quickly to secure their prey, chopping away at the log to get hold of it. They go back home, leaving the dead opossum on the ground. They proudly tell the story, which is said by the author to dwarf the feats of Pompey, Samson, Julius Caesar, Cyrus the Great, and other great military leaders of antiquity, as well as of American Indian chief Black Hawk; winning the praise of their parents and admiration of their younger brother. They go to sleep, dreaming of opossums as strong as bears and as large as cattle. Early the next morning, the two boys go to see their catch, but cannot find it. The &quot;vile possum&quot; had tricked them by playing dead—as opossums do when threatened and cornered. The kids never find the opossum again, and feel dejected.

==Analysis==
===Title===
While &quot;carmen possum&quot; may sound like a Latin phrase, it is grammatically incorrect. The closest interpretation, satisfying (if only barely) the requirements of syntax, would be &quot;I am capable of song&quot; (with &quot;of&quot; here constituting not a stand-alone preposition but rather a portion of an English phrasal verb).

However, as the text reveals (&quot;Up they jump to see the varmin / Of the which this is the carmen&quot;), the title itself is a macaronic mix of Latin and English, and should be understood as &quot;Song of [the] Opossum&quot;. Yet, the noun &quot;possum&quot;, if it were a Latin word, should be in the genitive case (&quot;possi) rather than the nominative (&quot;possum). Although one could assume that &quot;possum&quot; is an indeclinable noun.

===Poem structure===
The poem is written from a third-person omniscient perspective in a rhyming mix of trochaic tetrameter and iambic tetrameter, with turns of phrase satirising Homerian epic.

<text>James Robert Kalsu (April 13, 1945 – July 21, 1970) was an American professional football player who was an All-American tackle at the University of Oklahoma and an eighth-round selection in the 1968 NFL/AFL draft by the Buffalo Bills of the American Football League (AFL). Kalsu joined the U.S. Army as an officer after the 1968 season and was killed in action in the Vietnam War in 1970.

Kalsu was one of two professional football players killed in the Vietnam War and the last to be killed serving as a soldier in a war until Pat Tillman in 2004.

==Biography==
James Robert Kalsu was born on 13 April 1945 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and attended Del City High School. Kalsu was a starting guard for the Buffalo Bills in the 1968 season, playing the entire season and was the Bills&#x27; team rookie-of-the-year.

Following the 1968 season, to satisfy his Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) obligation, Kalsu entered the U.S. Army as a second lieutenant and arrived in South Vietnam in November 1969 as part of the 101st Airborne Division. On July 21, 1970, Kalsu was killed in action at the Battle of Fire Support Base Ripcord when his unit came under enemy 82-millimeter mortar fire while stationed near the A Shau Valley in Thua Thien Province. His family has declined to talk in detail about the circumstances surrounding his death.

When Kalsu had left for South Vietnam, he had to say goodbye to his wife, Jan, and his daughter Jill. On July 23, 1970, two days after his death, Jan gave birth to his son, James Robert Kalsu Jr, at the Kalsu home in Oklahoma City, and was informed that he had died only hours later. Kalsu was one of two professional football players killed in action during the Vietnam War along with Don Steinbrunner, a former Cleveland Brown player who died on July 20, 1967. Kalsu and Steinbrunner were the first professional players to be killed in action since Al Blozis of the New York Football Giants died during World War II in 1945. Kalsu remained the last professional player to be killed in action until Pat Tillman died in the Afghanistan War in 2004.

==Legacy==
*FOB Kalsu in Babil, Iraq, was founded and named after him by the 105th Military Police Company from Buffalo, New York, in early 2003. The name was chosen in a way to honor his sacrifice for his country and his connection to the Buffalo Bills. 
*In 1999, NFL Films produced a feature on Kalsu that was nominated for an Emmy Award.
*In 2000, the Buffalo Bills added Kalsu&#x27;s name to the Buffalo Bills Wall of Fame.
*In 2002, the replacement company at Fort Campbell was named in honor of him – 1LT J. Robert Kalsu Replacement Company.
*Del City High School&#x27;s football stadium bears his name.
* There is a CrossFit Work Out of the Day (WOD) named in his honor.
*There is a post office in Del City, Oklahoma, named for Kalsu. The legislation was signed in law by President Barack Obama on November 5, 2015, and the post office was dedicated on November 5, 2016. The official name of the post office is the James Robert Kalsu Post Office, located at 4500 SE 28th Street in Del City, where Kalsu played high school football before enrolling at the University of Oklahoma.

<text>Craterus, also spelled Krateros (; 370 BC – 321 BC), was a Macedonian general under Alexander the Great and one of the Diadochi. Throughout his life, he was a loyal royalist and supporter of Alexander the Great. 

Craterus was the son of a Macedonian nobleman named Alexander from Orestis and brother of admiral Amphoterus. Craterus commanded the phalanx and all infantry on the left wing in Battle of Issus in 333 BC. In Hyrcania, he was sent on a mission against the Tapurians, his first independent command with the Macedonian army. At the Battle of the Hydaspes in 326 BC, near modern Jhelum, he commanded the rearguard, which stayed on the western bank; his men crossed the river only during the final stages of the battle.

At the festivities in Susa, Craterus married princess Amastris, daughter of Oxyathres, the brother of Darius III. Craterus left Alexander&#x27;s troops in Opis in 324 BC. Craterus and Polyperchon were appointed to lead 11,500 veteran soldiers back to Macedonia and replace Antipater who was ordered to lead a fresh contingent of soldiers to join Alexander&#x27;s army in the east. But Craterus&#x27; arrival to Macedonia was delayed by a lack of vessels for the transport over the sea. Craterus stayed in Cilicia, where he was building the fleet, when Alexander unexpectedly died in Babylon. In case Craterus wouldn&#x27;t be able to govern in Macedonia due to his health, his successor was to be Polyperchon. At the time, he had about 10,000 veterans with him. Craterus eventually crossed into Europe when Antipater requested assistance from several commanders in the Lamian war, but leaving the supreme command in possession of Antipater.

He sailed with his Cilician navy to Greece and led troops at the Battle of Crannon in August 322 BC. When Antigonus rose in rebellion against Perdiccas and Eumenes, Craterus joined him, alongside Antipater and Ptolemy. He married Antipater&#x27;s daughter Phila, with whom he had a son, also called Craterus. 

He was killed in battle against Eumenes in Asia Minor when his charging horse fell over him, somewhere near the Hellespont, in 321 BC.

<text>The Memphis Sounds were an American professional sports franchise that played in Memphis, Tennessee from 1970 until 1975 as a member of the American Basketball Association. The team was first founded as the New Orleans Buccaneers in 1967.

Known during their time in Memphis as the Memphis Pros, Memphis Tams and, finally, Sounds, they played their home games at the Mid-South Coliseum.

==New Orleans Buccaneers 1967–1970==

The New Orleans Buccaneers were a charter member of the ABA. The Buccaneers were coached by Babe McCarthy, who was famous for two reasons. One was that he had coached Mississippi State University to a Southeastern Conference championship in an era when that league&#x27;s basketball was dominated by the University of Kentucky. The other was when the then all-white Mississippi state legislature forbade the team to participate in the racially integrated NCAA Tournament. McCarthy took the team out-of-state in the dead of night and had them participate anyway, which gave him a near-legend status in the eyes of some (and the undying hatred of others). Originally, in 1970, the Buccaneers had originally planned to rename their franchise to the &quot;Louisiana Buccaneers&quot; in order to gain a more regional fanbase within the state of Louisiana instead of limiting their popularity to just within the New Orleans area.

==Memphis Pros 1970–1972==
On August 21, 1970, the Buccaneers team was sold to Mississippi businessman P. W. Blake. Ten days later, he moved the team from the state of Louisiana to Memphis, Tennessee and changed its name to the Memphis Pros, reportedly because the already purchased &#x27;Bucs&#x27; uniforms could easily be converted to &#x27;Pros&#x27; uniforms at little expense by comparison.

===1970–1971 season===
The Pros immediately ran into problems due to the timing of the move. The Mid-South Coliseum was nearly booked through the winter, and the Pros were only able to secure one Friday home game. They were forced to play the balance of their home schedule in several other arenas in both the states of Tennessee and Mississippi. Not surprisingly, ticket sales slowed to a trickle; by the start of the season, they&#x27;d only sold 180 season tickets.

Bob Warren of the Los Angeles Stars joined the team, and Ron Franz and Dave Nash were traded to The Floridians for Wilbert Jones, Al Cueto, and Erv Staggs; later, Red Robbins was traded to the Utah Stars for Craig Raymond and Skeeter Swift was traded to the Pittsburgh Pipers for Charlie Williams. Jimmy Jones, Steve Jones, and Wendell Ladner played in the 1971 ABA All-Star Game; Ladner, a pick in the previous ABA draft, also made the ABA All-Rookie team. An average of 3,199 fans attended Pros home games during the season. The Pros finished with 41 wins and 43 losses, which put them in third place in the Eastern Division. The Pros advanced to the playoffs that year, but lost in the Eastern Division semifinals to the Indiana Pacers, four games to none.

The Pros almost did not survive that season because of the awkward situation they were in. In December 1970, Blake simply walked away from the team, claiming to have lost $200,000 from the operation. The league desperately tried to find a new owner, but there were no takers to acquire the team. Finally in February, a community group called &quot;Memphis Area Sports Inc.&quot; bought the team for $700,000, saving the franchise entirely. It was composed of 4,600 Tennessee residents who bought the team&#x27;s stock at $5, $10, and $50 a share and elected a 24-person board to run the team. Memphis bond broker Albert S. Hart was installed as team president.

===1971–1972 season===

The team signed Johnny Neumann, an underclassman All American from the University of Mississippi, and added Larry Cannon, but lost Steve Jones to the Dallas Chaparrals through free agency; Jimmy Jones also departed from the team, ending up with the defending-champion Utah Stars.

On October 6, 1971, the Pros hosted the NBA&#x27;s Boston Celtics for a preseason exhibition game. The Celtics won, 115–94. This was the only time a Memphis team had played an NBA team until the Vancouver Grizzlies moved to Memphis in 2001, thirty years later.

The Pros traded Larry Cannon to the Indiana Pacers in the mid-season period for Don Sidle, and executed another midseason trade which sent Wendell Ladner, Tom Owens, and Bobby Warren to the Carolina Cougars for Randy Denton, Warren Davis, and George Lehmann. The latter trade was initiated by Hart without consulting McCarthy first.

The Pros had one player, Wil Jones, play in the 1972 ABA All-Star Game.

Despite (or perhaps because of) all the personnel moves, the team finished with only 26 wins against 58 losses, which put them in fifth (last) place in the Western Division, 34 games behind the Utah Stars, and kept them out of the playoffs this season.

Although they averaged 4,441 fans per home game, the team&#x27;s financial problems cropped up again, which forced the league to take control of the team for the second time in a row.

On April 27, 1972, Babe McCarthy resigned as the Pros&#x27; coach.

==Memphis Tams 1972–1974==
On June 13, 1972, the team and its debts were purchased by Charles O. Finley, who also owned Major League Baseball&#x27;s Oakland A&#x27;s and the NHL&#x27;s California Golden Seals. Legendary former University of Kentucky head coach Adolph Rupp became team president during this period of time. The winning entry in a &quot;Rename the Team&quot; contest was the Memphis Tams. The nickname was an acronym for &quot;T&quot;ennessee – &quot;A&quot;rkansas – &quot;M&quot;ississippi, and the logo was a tam o&#x27;shanter-style hat in white, green and gold, which were also the new team colors, shared with Oakland-area based teams at the time in the Athletics and Golden Seals.

===1972–1973 season===
McCarthy was succeeded by Bob Bass. The Tams landed George Thompson in a dispersal draft of Pittsburgh Condors players. Gerald Govan was traded to the Utah Stars for Merv Jackson. George Thompson played in the ABA All Star game but the Tams finished the season with only 24 wins compared to 60 losses. It was the worst record in the ABA and put them in fifth (last) place in the Eastern Division, 33 games behind the Carolina Cougars. The Tams did not make the playoffs, in part due to heavy roster turnover (they made 28 roster moves during the first two months of the season alone). Despite their poor play, they still averaged 3,476 fans per home game.

Finley had the team wear all possible combinations of green, white, and gold tops and trunks. However, he had little to no involvement with franchise operations personally. Despite his earlier promises, he was already in negotiations with officials in St. Paul, Minnesota to move the team there. When word got out of this, Finley went from the franchise&#x27;s savior to a pariah almost overnight. He didn&#x27;t help his own cause by instituting several cost-cutting moves with the team.

===1973–1974 season===
The Tams picked up draft picks Larry Kenon and Larry Finch. The Tams also used a draft pick to select underclassman David Thompson but Thompson stayed in college. Finley had asked the ABA to look into his claims that ABA president Bill Daniels had a conflict of interest due to asking Finley to pay him a finder&#x27;s fee for helping Finley find potential buyers for his team. The ABA declined to investigate Finley&#x27;s charges.

Finley tried to sell the team to a group of investors from Providence, Rhode Island with a potential interest in moving the team there, but no sale was forthcoming. For much of the summer, the Tams&#x27; status was up in the air. Bass had resigned to take a position with the league, and the team offices had been closed since mid-June. It was not until late August that Finley sent word that the Tams would play for the upcoming season. In the process, he&#x27;d held up almost all of the league&#x27;s radio and TV contracts. Even then, the team had no coach and virtually no front office when training camp opened up in September. Finally, two days before the team&#x27;s first preseason game, Butch van Breda Kolff was hired as general manager and head coach.

The Tams signed Charlie Edge, traded Larry Kenon to the New York Nets for Jim Ard and John Baum and traded Johnny Neumann to the Utah Stars for Glen Combs, Ronnie Robinson, Mike Jackson and cash. George Thompson played in the ABA All Star game but the team had another poor season, finishing with 21 wins and 63 losses—the worst record in all of pro basketball.

With their poor play, the team&#x27;s home attendance dropped by about one-third from the prior season as the Tams averaged 2,331 fans per home game. This was largely because Finley seemed to lose whatever interest he had left in the Tams. He went weeks without communicating with van Breda Kolff about team business or roster moves. He also stopped putting out programs entirely, replacing them with free typed mimeographed lineup sheets. Butch van Breda Kolff was visibly frustrated with the situation, telling &quot;Basketball News&quot; that the Tams would be a solid franchise if they just had solid backing in mind instead.

==Memphis Sounds 1974–1975==
It soon became apparent that the Tams were not high on the list of Finley&#x27;s priorities. Amenities like programs began to disappear, and morale suffered as players began to wonder if they would receive paychecks and if those would clear the bank when they did. After two seasons of this, the ABA stepped in and took control of the team. ABA Commissioner Mike Storen resigned his position with the league to take over the operation and run the team in Memphis.

Storen lined up several notable local figures as co-owners of the new team, including funk and soul musician Isaac Hayes and Holiday Inn founder Kemmons Wilson. Storen named the new team the Memphis Sounds and developed a new red and white color scheme and logo, a move that had been met with positive reception for both the ABA and the fans of the franchise alike.

Storen cleared out the former Tams roster and brought in veteran players such as Mel Daniels, Freddie Lewis, Roger Brown, Chuck Williams, Collis Jones, George Carter, Rick Mount and Julius Keye. The only player who had played for the Tams who appeared in uniform for the Sounds was Larry Finch, a local favorite because he had played college basketball at Memphis State University.

The Sounds, coached by Joe Mullaney, finished the 1974–75 season with a record of 27–57, which was good for fourth place in the Eastern Division and a spot in the 1975 ABA Playoffs due to the Virginia Squires having a faultier operation by this time by comparison. Unfortunately for the Sounds, their first round opponent was the Kentucky Colonels, who had won the Eastern Division and defeated the Sounds 4 games to 1 (the one win being the only playoff-game victory in the franchise&#x27;s tenure while in Memphis) en route to the Colonels winning the 1975 ABA Championship.

== Aftermath ==
The team&#x27;s elimination by the Colonels would be the last meaningful game that the franchise would play. Although the 1974–75 season saw the highest attendance figures during the team&#x27;s stay in Memphis, both Wilson and Hayes were having financial troubles that required them to sell their shares. After the 1974–75 season the ABA franchise was sold to a group of businessmen in Baltimore, Maryland who used it to create a team that was first briefly known as the Baltimore Hustlers and then officially as the Baltimore Claws. A local group had planned on purchasing the franchise and keep them in Memphis at first, but they ultimately reneged on purchasing the team following the conflict involved with the Baltimore businessmen. However, the team had serious financial problems under the new owners and collapsed before the season started, playing only three exhibition games (all of which ended in defeat) in its brief history.

Not long after the Claws folded, the San Diego Sails and then the Utah Stars folded early in the 1975–76 regular season, abruptly shrinking the league from 10 teams to just 7. The failure of those franchises was a key factor behind the ABA–NBA merger coming into place in the summer after the 1975–76 season ended.

When the ABA became defunct and the copyrights on its properties were allowed to lapse, a new minor league baseball team in Nashville — the Nashville Sounds — adopted the Memphis Sounds&#x27; color scheme and logo. As of 2025, the name is still in use. The use of the color scheme and styled logo was replaced as the primary scheme after the 1998 season, but it&#x27;s still used on the field for Throwback Thursday promotions, and merchandise featuring the mark remains in regular availability.

In 2001, professional basketball returned to Memphis with the National Basketball Association (NBA)&#x27;s Memphis Grizzlies, who relocated from Vancouver, British Columbia up in Canada. The Grizzlies played their home games at The Pyramid from 2001 until 2004, before moving to FedExForum for the 2004–05 season, and have called it home since then.

During the , the Grizzlies wore Hardwood Classics throwback uniforms honoring the heritage of the Memphis Sounds for select games. The Hardwood Classics uniforms debuted on November 16, 2015, during the Grizzlies&#x27; home game vs. the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Grizzlies planned to wear the throwback uniforms for six more games (three home, three away) during the 2015–16 season.
