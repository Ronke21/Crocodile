Artwork by Omar Angulo

==Legal problems==
In the inlay of this CD, there is a scanned letter from the American Automobile Association (from 1998). Their trademark consists of three As in an oval. They complained to Hopeless Records that the logo Against All Authority uses is the same as theirs, and they threatened to sue the label. After this, Against All Authority&#x27;s logo was changed and previous CDs with the offending logo were replaced with the new one. However, in response to this argument, their next album was entitled 24 Hour Roadside Resistance, making fun of the American Automobile Association&#x27;s slogan &quot;24 Hour Roadside Assistance&quot;.

<doc id="666193" wikidata="Q7569965" url="?curid=666193" title="Southern Harmony">
<text>The Southern Harmony, and Musical Companion is a shape note hymn and tune book compiled by William Walker, first published in 1835. The book is notable for having originated or popularized several hymn tunes found in modern hymnals and shape note collections like &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot;.

== The music and its notation ==
The roots of &quot;Southern Harmony&quot; singing, like the Sacred Harp, are found in the American colonial era, when singing schools convened to provide instruction in choral singing, especially for use in church services. This practice remained popular with Baptists in the South long after it fell from use in other regions.

In 1801, a book called &quot;The Easy Instructor&quot; by William Smith and William Little was published for the use of this movement; its distinguishing feature was the use of four separate shapes that indicated the notes according to the rules of solfege. A triangle indicated &quot;fa&quot;, a circle &quot;sol&quot;, a square &quot;la&quot; and a diamond, &quot;mi.&quot; To avoid proliferating shapes excessively, each shape (and its associated syllable) except for &quot;mi&quot; was assigned to two notes of the musical scale. A major scale in the system would be noted &quot;Fa – Sol – La – Fa – Sol – La – Mi – Fa&quot;, and a minor scale would be &quot;La – Mi – Fa – Sol – La – Fa – Sol – La.&quot;

== History ==
&quot;The Southern Harmony, and Musical Companion&quot; was compiled by William &quot;Singin&#x27; Billy&quot; Walker and printed in 1835, with subsequent editions printed in Philadelphia. It contained 335 songs, went through several editions, and became one of the most popular southern tunebooks in the 19th century. In 1867 Walker claimed over 600,000 copies had been sold. Walker added an appendix of additional tunes in 1840 with a further enlargement in 1847. An 1854 revision deleted several tunes and added still more. The present edition is a facsimile reprint of the 1854 edition.

In 1866, Walker published a tunebook entitled &quot;The Christian Harmony&quot;, in which he changed from four shape to seven shape notation. He incorporated over half of the contents of &quot;The Southern Harmony&quot; in the &quot;Christian Harmony.&quot; Walker died on September 30, 1887.

The &quot;Southern Harmony&quot; has remained unchanged since 1854, unlike its counterpart the &quot;Sacred Harp&quot;, which went through several revisions in the 20th century. About 75% of the songs are presented in three-part harmony.

Besides Walker, notable contributors to &quot;Southern Harmony&quot; included Matilda T. Durham and John Gill Landrum.

==Related==
The American composer William Duckworth used some of the songs in the Southern Harmony as a starting point for his own minimalist choral arrangements of the same name.

Composer Donald Grantham also composed a four-movement piece for wind ensemble based on the anthology, entitled &quot;Southern Harmony&quot;.

The Black Crowes named their second album &quot;The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion&quot; after this song anthology.

<text>The parliamentary committees of the United Kingdom are committees of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Each consists of a small number of Members of Parliament from the House of Commons, or peers from the House of Lords, or a mix of both, appointed to deal with particular areas or issues; most are made up of members of the Commons. The majority of parliamentary committees are select committees. The remit of these committees vary depending on whether they are committees of the House of Commons or the House of Lords.

==House of Commons==
===Select committees===
Select committees in the Commons are designed to oversee the work of departments and agencies, examine topical issues affecting the country or individual regions or nations, and review and advise on the procedures, workings and rules of the House.

*Departmental select committees are designed to oversee and examine the work of individual government departments and any related departmental bodies and agencies.

====Legislative====

====Regional Grand Committees====
Eight regional grand committees were established by temporary standing orders which were in force between January 2009 and May 2010. Each committee related with one of the eight regions of England outside Greater London, and all MPs from constituencies in each region were able to attend and participate in the proceedings of the relevant regional grand committee. It was envisioned that the committees would meet twice a year, however in reality they only ever met once in Autumn 2009 before being abolished the following year.

====Regional Select Committees====
The House of Commons set up eight regional select committees in November 2008, whose members were first appointed on 3 March 2009. The committees were formed of five Labour members, as opposed to the nine members from various parties as was agreed in the original motion, due to the refusal of the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats to nominate any members as a sign of their opposition to setting up the committees. The resolution that formed the committees expired at the end of the 2005/10 Parliament. The succeeding coalition government of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats chose not to renew it.

<text>Operation Pluto (Pipeline Under the Ocean or Pipeline Underwater Transportation of Oil, also written Operation PLUTO) was an operation by British engineers, oil companies and the British Armed Forces to build oil pipelines under the English Channel to support Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Normandy during the Second World War.

The British War Office estimated that petrol, oil, and lubricants would account for more than 60 per cent of the weight of supplies required by the expeditionary forces. Pipelines would reduce the need for coastal tankers, which could be hindered by bad weather, were subject to air attack, and needed to be offloaded into vulnerable storage tanks ashore. A new kind of pipeline was required that could be rapidly deployed. Two types were developed, named &quot;Hais&quot; and &quot;Hamel&quot; after their inventors. Two pipeline systems were laid, each connected by camouflaged pumping stations to the Avonmouth-Thames pipeline. 

The first was the not-very-successful &quot;Bambi&quot; project, which connected Shanklin on the Isle of Wight to Cherbourg in Normandy. Deployment of Bambi began on 12 August 1944, and it delivered just between 22 September, when the first pipeline became operational, and 4 October, when it was terminated. More successful was &quot;Dumbo&quot;, which ran from Dungeness on the Kent coast to Boulogne in Pas-de-Calais. The Dumbo system began pumping on 26 October, expanded to 17 pipelines by December, and remained in action until 7 August 1945. Ultimately, the pipelines carried about 8 per cent of all petroleum products sent from the United Kingdom to the Allied Expeditionary Force in North West Europe, including some of petrol.

== Background ==
In early April 1942, the Chief of Combined Operations, Vice-Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, approached the Secretary for Petroleum, Geoffrey Lloyd, and asked if an oil pipeline could be laid across the English Channel. Mountbatten was tasked with planning the Allied invasion of German-occupied Europe, and had concerns about the supply of petroleum products, since it was considered unlikely that a port with oil reception facilities could be quickly secured. The British War Office estimated that 60 per cent or more by weight of the supplies of the expeditionary forces would consist of petrol, oil and lubricants (POL). In the initial stages of the assault, packaged fuel would be supplied in jerricans and drums. To supply the twenty million jerricans required, an entire American manufacturing plant was shipped to the London area, where it was operated by the Magnatex firm under the supervision of the Ministry of Supply. By 1944, a stockpile of of packaged petrol and diesel fuel had been accumulated in the UK.
After the first few days of the invasion, it was hoped that petroleum could be supplied in bulk. Pipelines were not the sole or even the principal means by which Combined Operations was contemplating supplying bulk petroleum; it intended to rely primarily on small shallow-draught coastal tankers, of which thirty were under construction. American &quot;Y&quot; tankers began arriving in the UK in the spring of 1944. In 1943, the British also initiated a programme to construct Channel tankers (Chants), but only 37 were completed by May 1944. It was hoped that petroleum products might also be supplied by ocean-going T2 tankers lying offshore through ship-to-shore pipelines. The project to develop these pipelines was codenamed Operation Tombola, and the pipelines themselves became known as Tombolas. The submarine pipeline had sufficient advantages to make it worthwhile to explore as a backup means of supply. Submarine pipelines were less susceptible to enemy air attack and the frequently stormy English Channel weather, and their use would reduce the forces&#x27; dependency on vulnerable storage tanks ashore.

Lloyd consulted his expert advisors: Brigadier Sir Donald Banks, the director-general of the Petroleum Warfare Department; Sir , a former director of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and the oil advisor to the Fourth Sea Lord; and George Martin Lees, an eminent geologist. At the time, submarine pipelines were in use in ports and over short distances, but no pipeline had ever been laid across such a great distance or under the currents and tidal conditions found in the English Channel. Moreover, to minimise interference by the enemy and the effect of the tides, the entire pipeline would have to be laid in a single night. They regarded the proposal as infeasible using any known method of construction of pipelines or more in diameter.

The Chief Engineer of Anglo-Iranian, Clifford Hartley, was visiting the Petroleum Warfare Department at this time, and he heard about the proposal, and was convinced that it was possible. In the hilly terrain of Iran, Anglo-Iranian had employed a pipeline. Running at , it delivered per day, the equivalent of over 20,000 jerricans. On 15 April he pitched his proposal for a continuous length of pipeline similar to a submarine communications cable without the core and insulation, but with armour to withstand the internal pressure, which could be deployed by a cable-layer ship. Additional capacity could be obtained by laying multiple lines. By using high pressure, the line could carry different kinds of fuel. At low pressure different fuels would mix, but at high pressure they would stay separate. Thus, the pipeline could be used for aviation spirit, and then switched to diesel fuel.

The project was given the codename Pluto, which stood for &quot;pipeline underwater transportation of oil&quot; or &quot;pipeline under the ocean&quot;. The operation was placed under the chief of staff to the Supreme Allied Commander, Designate (COSSAC). The G-4 section of the COSSAC staff, which assumed responsibility for Pluto, was headed by British Major General Nevil Brownjohn, with American Colonel F. L. Rash, Colonel Frank M. Albrecht, and Major General Robert W. Crawford successively as his deputy. Royal Navy Captain John Fenwick Hutchings from the Admiralty&#x27;s Department of Miscellaneous Weapons Development was placed in command of Operation Pluto. By VE-Day his command would consist of several ships, over 100 merchant navy officers and more than 1,000 men.

==Development==
===Hais===

Hartley received support for his proposal from the chairman of Anglo-Iranian, Sir William Fraser, who was also the petroleum advisor to the War Office, and from Henry Wright, the managing director of Siemens Brothers. Fraser agreed to pick up the costs of trials, albeit in the hope that the government would subsequently reimburse the company. Siemens Brothers developed the cable in conjunction with the National Physical Laboratory based on their existing undersea telegraph cable. It was known as Hais, from Hartley-Anglo-Iranian-Siemens. 

The diameter inner pipe, which would carry the petroleum, was made from extruded lead. This was surrounded by a layer of asphalt and paper impregnated with vinylite resin. Steel tape was wound around this to give it strength and flexibility. Around this was a layer of jute tape and asphalt-impregnated paper. Finally, it was covered by a protective layer of fifty galvanised steel wires, and camouflaged canvas cover. The pipe could deliver per day at a pressure of , and withstand an underwater pressure of . The 2-inch size was chosen to keep the weight down; a larger cable would have required a larger ship to deploy it.

A prototype was laid across the River Medway by the Post Office cable ship on 10 May 1942. A pumping test was then carried out using pumps borrowed from the Manchester Ship Canal Company. After two days of pumping, a failure occurred. The cable was pulled up, and the problem was found to have been caused by extrusion of the lead through gaps in the steel tape. Accordingly, the amount of steel tape was increased from two to four layers. At Siemens&#x27; suggestion, a second supplier, Henleys, was brought in to increase manufacturing capacity. A second test was carried out in June across the Firth of Clyde, with lengths of pipe manufactured by both Siemens and Henleys. The pipe was laid by the Post Office cable ship &quot;Iris&quot;. Both functioned successfully. Of the of Hais cable produced for the operation, were made by firms in the United Kingdom, while was manufactured in the United States by four American firms, including The Okonite Calendar Company, General Cable, Phelps Dodge and the General Electric Company.
Full-scale production of the two-inch pipe was started on 14 August 1942, using steel from the Corby Steelworks, and on 30 October, of it was loaded on board under the command of Commander Henry Treby-Heale, which was to be used as a full-scale rehearsal of Operation Pluto. This trial occurred on 29 December 1942. A 30-mile length was laid across the Bristol Channel in rough weather at a rate of with the shore ends being connected at Swansea and Ilfracombe. The sturdiness of the cable pipe was further tested when two German bombs were dropped on Swansea from the cable. Later a ship&#x27;s anchor dragged the cable pipe, but &quot;Holdfast&quot; was able to locate and repair the damage. To prove the reliability of the cable pipe, pumping operations were carried out continuously, first at the original design pressure of , and then at , with of fuel delivered per day.

The trial was sufficiently successful that it was decided to develop -diameter pipe. This reduced the number of pipelines required to pump the same volume of petrol, as each 3-inch pipe had more than twice the capacity of the 2-inch pipe. A merchant ship, HMS &quot;Algerian&quot; was acquired, and converted to carry of 3-inch cable pipe. Two more, the converted Liberty ships and (later renamed &quot;Empire Baffin&quot; and &quot;Empire Ridley&quot; respectively) with a displacement of , could each handle of 3-inch pipe weighing approximately . Two storage tanks in diameter, one forward and one aft, provided the stowage space for the pipe. Thames barges were converted to handle connecting the cable at the shore ends, where the waters were too shallow for these ships to operate. These were HM cable barges &quot;Britannic&quot;, &quot;Oceanic&quot;, &quot;Runic&quot;, &quot;Gold Dust&quot; and &quot;Gold Drift&quot;. Each was long with a beam and a loaded displacement of carrying of three-inch Hais pipe. 

Anglo-Iranian Oil personnel supervised the erection of pumping equipment by the Royal Army Service Corps (RASC), Pioneer Corps and Royal Engineers personnel, and a RASC bulk petroleum company was specially trained to operate them. A Port of London Authority factory at Tilbury was requisitioned and converted into a cable pipe factory where of cable pipe per day was tested, welded into lengths and stored.

===Hamel===

Lead was in short supply, so the Petroleum Warfare Department decided to seek an alternative that made use of cheaper and more readily available materials as a backup system to Hais, which was itself a backup system. Bernard J. Ellis, the chief engineer of the Burmah Oil Company, was convinced that a flexible pipeline could be built from mild steel, which was more readily available than lead. His pipe was in diameter, with walls.

The prototype was fabricated in segments by J &amp; E Hall, a firm better known as a manufacturer of refrigeration equipment. The segments were made to be flash welded together. Normally welded pipe gave trouble due to rings of residue that formed around each weld. Ellis designed a special broaching tool to remove the metal swarf. Ellis teamed with H. A. Hammick, the chief engineer of Iraq Petroleum Company, and the pipe became known as &#x27;Hamel&#x27; after their surnames, although after the war Ellis successfully asserted his claim to be recognised as the sole inventor.

Unlike Hais, Hamel pipe was too stiff to be coiled in a ship&#x27;s hold, as it could not withstand the twist along the longitudinal axis that came with each turn of the coil. The Petroleum Warfare Department proposed that it be wound around a buoyant steel drum that could be towed by tugs or fitted on a Hopper barge. The resulting steel drum was long and in diameter, and was known as a &quot;Conun&quot; or &quot;Conundrum&quot;. Tests were carried out in the Froude tank at the National Physical Laboratory to verify that Conundrums could be towed at speed without yawing.
Stewarts &amp; Lloyds undertook to design, construct and operate two factories at Tilbury where lengths of pipe were welded together into segments. Six Conundrums were constructed at a cost of £30,000 apiece, and named 1 through 6. A Conundrum was towed to a special dock where it was held by two steel arms. A sprocket chain driven by an electric motor rotated the Conundrum while pipe was wound around it. At the end of each segment, the next was welded, the swarf was cleaned out, and the process continued until the Conundrum held of pipe, at which point it had a displacement of .

An Admiralty hopper barge named &quot;W.24&quot; was converted to carry a Conundrum, and named HMS &quot;Persephone&quot;. It was a twin-screw vessel and wide. On 4 June 1943 a trial lay of one mile of Hamel pipe was successfully carried out. Though not having the capacity to cross the Channel, Persephone laid 16 Hamel pipes across the Solent to the Isle of Wight. It was not known precisely how long the Hamel pipe would last, but it was assumed to be about six weeks. Fluorescein dye was added to the fuel to allow patrol aircraft to detect leaks. In view of this success, it was decided to utilise both Hais and Hamel.

===Pumping stations===

In the spring of 1943, the Petroleum Warfare Department selected sites for the pumping stations. One was established at Sandown on the Isle of Wight, and another at Dungeness on the Kent coast. Construction was carried out at night and in secret, and equipment was carried in under tarpaulins. The pumping stations and storage tanks were camouflaged to look like villas, seaside cottages, old forts, amusement parks and other innocuous features. Strict instructions were issued that neither &quot;Petroleum Warfare Department&quot; nor its initials should appear on any letter or package. The locations were erased from maps. Lorry drivers conducting deliveries had to phone from a public phone booth for instructions.

Each pumping station was equipped with thirty diesel-powered reciprocating pumps with a capacity of per day, and four large Byron Jackson Company electric centrifugal pumps capable of per day, which worked out to at . Both stations were fed from the Avonmouth-Thames pipeline, which had a capacity of per month. A branch line was constructed connecting Dungeness with its eastern terminal at Walton-on-Thames. Sandown was connected to the system through a link between the Isle of Wight and Fawley Refinery. The pipeline connections to Pluto were completed by March 1944.

The corresponding sites in France were selected in June 1943. Sandown would be connected to the port of Cherbourg, a distance of over . Dungeness would be connected to the port of Ambleteuse. In keeping with the Disney theme suggested by Pluto, the former was codenamed &quot;Bambi&quot; and the latter &quot;Dumbo&quot;.

As part of the Operation Overlord deception operation known as Operation Fortitude, a fake oil dock was created at Dover. The architect Basil Spence was called upon to design it. Constructed from camouflaged scaffolding, fibreboard and old sewage pipe, the fake facility spanned and included fake versions of pipelines, storage tanks, jetties, vehicle parks and antiaircraft emplacements. Wind machines were used to create clouds of dust to simulate activity, and the site was guarded by the military police. At night it was obscured by a smoke screen. German aircraft were allowed to overfly the facility, but only above , where high-resolution imagery was not possible. The fake facility was inspected by King George VI, and the Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower and his ground forces commander, General Sir Bernard Montgomery spoke to the &quot;workers&quot;.

==Placement==
===Bambi===
According to the original Operation Overlord plan, Cherbourg was supposed to be captured within eight days of D-Day (D+8) and, despite the expectation that the Germans would carry out systematic demolitions, be opened within three days. Pipe laying was to commence four days later, with the Bambi system fully operational by D+75 (seventy-five days after D-Day). The discovery of an additional German division in the vicinity in May led to the expected capture being pushed back ten days from D+8 to D+18. In the event, the port of Cherbourg was captured on 27 June (D+21), and due to the extensive damage the first POL tanker did not discharge there until 25 July (D+49). In the meantime, fuel was supplied through the small port of Port-en-Bessin by coastal tankers, and from ocean-going tankers using two Tombola lines at Port-en-Bessin for the British and five at Sainte-Honorine-des-Pertes for the Americans. The Tombola lines had a tendency to break, and the Chants fared poorly in the rough weather of the English Channel. By 28 July sixteen of them were laid up for repairs at a special tanker repair facility that had been established at Hamble-le-Rice.
Consideration was given to cancelling Pluto, but under the circumstances it was decided to proceed. Time was wasted in deciding whether to terminate the line inside or outside the harbour; eventually the latter was chosen. The first Hais pipeline was laid by HMS &quot;Latimer&quot; in just ten hours on 12 August 1944, but the pipeline failed when an escorting destroyer caught it with its anchor and damaged it beyond repair. A second effort was made by HMS &quot;Sancroft&quot; two days later. This too failed when the pipe became wrapped around the propeller of the support ship, HMS &quot;Algerian&quot;. An attempt to lay Hamel pipe instead failed on 27 August when it was discovered that tons of barnacles had attached themselves to the bottom of HMS &quot;Conundrum 1&quot;, thereby preventing it from rotating. The barnacles were scraped off, and another attempt was made a few days later, but the pipeline broke about out.

The expert technicians had been able to lay pipelines across the Bristol Channel and the Solent under the supervision of the designers, but it was another matter for the naval laying parties to achieve the same degree of proficiency under wartime conditions and across the much wider English Channel. Sir Donald Banks wrote: &quot;The technique of cable laying had been mastered but we were not yet sufficiently versed in the practice of connecting the shore ends, nor in effecting repairs to the undersea leaks which were caused fairly close inshore through these faulty concluding operations.&quot;

Finally, on 22 September a Hais cable was laid that worked, delivering per day. This was followed on 29 September by the successful installation of a Hamel cable by HMS &quot;Conundrum 2&quot;. However, on 3 October when the pressure was increased from to augment the amount of fuel pumped, both pipelines failed: the Hais due to a faulty coupling, and the Hamel when it encountered a sharp edge on the ocean floor. Operation Bambi was terminated the following day. Only about () of fuel had been transferred.

===Dumbo===

Meanwhile, the port of Rouen had been captured on 30 August, and Le Havre on 12 September. Le Havre was badly damaged in the fighting and by demolitions. Rouen, an inland port up the Seine River, was in better shape, with its quays largely intact, although demolitions had been carried out and the river channel to it was blocked by mines and sunken vessels. Even when it was cleared the channel from Le Havre was shallow, but coastal tankers carrying POL from the UK were able to navigate it and discharge in Rouen. Boulogne was captured on 22 September, and the port was opened on 22 October.

A Hais pipeline was laid by HMS &quot;Sancroft&quot;, which commenced pumping on 26 October, and remained in action until the end of the war. Lines were run to a beach in the outer harbour of Boulogne, distant across the Strait of Dover, instead of Ambleteuse as originally planned because the beach at the latter was heavily mined. This involved a longer distance and a more difficult approach, but cable-laying techniques had been refined. The ends of the cable were dropped just offshore and picked up by the barges for connection to the shore. The Hamel pipe gave more trouble, but after some trial and error, it was laid with sections of Hais pipe at each end. Boulogne also had poor railway facilities, so the pipeline was extended to Calais where better railway connections were available to transport the fuel. This extension was completed in November.

By December, nine 3-inch and two 2-inch Hamel pipelines and four 3-inch and two 2-inch Hais cable pipelines had been laid, a total of 17 pipelines, and Dumbo was providing of petrol per day. Not one of the Hais cable pipelines broke, and the mean time between repairs of the Hamel pipelines varied between 52 and 112 days, with 68 days being the average. They could not be run at the intended pressure, so they carried only petrol, and plans for the pipelines to deliver aviation spirit as well were discarded.
In December there was reconsideration of whether to continue with Operation Pluto. By this time Antwerp was unloading an ocean-going tanker a day, and coastal tankers were delivering per day to Ostend, and a similar amount to Rouen. On the other hand, only Antwerp and Cherbourg were capable of handling the large tankers, but Antwerp was under attack from V-1 flying bombs and V-2 rockets, and it was considered inadvisable for it handle more than one tanker at a time. As for the coastal tankers, they were in demand for service in the Far East. It was therefore decided to continue with Operation Pluto.

As the fighting moved on to Germany, Dumbo was connected to an inland pipeline system that was extended from Boulogne to Antwerp, Eindhoven and ultimately Emmerich. Dumbo surpassed its target of (about ) per day on 15 March 1945, and by 3 April the Dumbo lines were delivering a day to the Rhine. New lines continued to be laid, the last one being laid on 24 May.

The system was finally closed down to save manpower on 7 August, by which time the pipelines had carried of petrol. Operation Pluto was officially disbanded on 31 August, and the Petroleum Warfare Department was wound up on 31 March 1946. The Tilbury plant was transferred to the Admiralty, and all remaining stores to the Ministry of Supply. No post-war use of the technology was contemplated, so Operation Pluto&#x27;s records were sent to the Public Record Office, where they remained sealed for the next thirty years. The Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors awarded tax-free payments of £9,000 to Hartley; £5,000 to Ellis; £85 to M. K. Purvis, the designer of the Conundrum; and £250 to A. E. Price, who designed the wedge gripping device used to fix the pipeline near the shore.

It is estimated that nearly of petroleum products were delivered to the Allied Expeditionary Force. Of this, came directly from the United States and (84 per cent) from the United Kingdom, of which Operation Pluto contributed or 8 per cent. The total cost of Operation Pluto was reckoned at £4,428,000.

==Recovery and salvage==

After the war, more than 85 per cent of the pipeline was salvaged and subsequently scrapped. This was accomplished during the period September 1946 to October 1949, using &quot;Latimer&quot; and &quot;Holdfast&quot; (by then operated by Ministry of War Transport under the names &quot;Empire Ridley&quot; and &quot;Empire Taw&quot;), &quot;Empire Tigness&quot; (a former German tanker), &quot;Wrangler&quot; (an ex-Admiralty Mark III tank landing craft), and &quot;Redeemer&quot; (an ex-Admiralty motor fishing vessel).

In all, of the original of lead and of the original of steel were recovered, along with of petrol that were still in the pipelines. The value of the scrap lead and steel was well in excess of the costs of recovery. The total value of the salvaged steel and lead was estimated at £400,000.

Although the pipeline itself is no longer in use, many of the buildings that were constructed or utilised to disguise it remain, especially on the Isle of Wight, where the former pumping station at Sandown is currently in use as a miniature golf facility.

== Historiography ==
The value of Operation Pluto was controversial. Samuel Eliot Morison, the United States naval historian, noted that the pipelines &quot;proved very useful for supplying the Allied armies as they advanced in Germany.&quot; According to the civil official historian, Michael Postan, Operation Pluto was &quot;strategically important, tactically adventurous, and, from the industrial point of view, strenuous&quot;. On 24 May 1945, Winston Churchill described Operation Pluto as &quot;a wholly British achievement and a piece of amphibious engineering skill of which we may well be proud.&quot;

A contrary view was expressed by Derek Payton-Smith in the civil official history volume on oil: &quot;Pluto contributed nothing to Allied supplies at a time that would have been most valuable—that is, when no regular oil ports were available on the Continent and the Allies were relying on the unsatisfactory Port-en-Bessin. Dumbo was more successful, but at a time when success was of less importance.&quot; A similar sentiment was expressed by Major-General Sir Frederick Morgan, the head of the COSSAC staff, who considered that Bambi was not worthwhile, although he lauded Dumbo.

<text>Zygmunt Bauman (; ; 19 November 1925 – 9 January 2017) was a Polish–British sociologist and philosopher. He was driven out of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic during the 1968 Polish political crisis and forced to give up his Polish citizenship. He emigrated to Israel; three years later he moved to the United Kingdom. He resided in England from 1971, where he studied at the London School of Economics and became Professor of Sociology at the University of Leeds, later emeritus. Bauman was a social theorist, writing on issues as diverse as modernity and the Holocaust, postmodern consumerism and liquid modernity.

==Life and career==
Bauman was born to a non-observant Polish Jewish family in Poznań, Second Polish Republic, in 1925. In 1939, when Poland was invaded by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, his family escaped eastwards into the USSR.

During World War II, Bauman enlisted in the Soviet-controlled First Polish Army, working as a political instructor. He took part in the Battle of Kolberg (1945) and the Battle of Berlin. In May 1945, he was awarded the Military Cross of Valour. After World War II he became one of the Polish Army&#x27;s youngest majors.

According to the Polish Institute of National Remembrance, from 1945 to 1953 Bauman was a political officer in the Internal Security Corps (KBW), a military intelligence unit formed to combat the Ukrainian Insurgent Army and the remnants of the Polish Home Army. However, the nature and extent of his involvement remain unknown, as well as the exact circumstances under which it was terminated.
In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Bauman confirmed he had been a committed Communist during and after World War II and had never made a secret of it. He admitted that joining the military intelligence service at age 19 was a mistake although he had a &quot;dull&quot; desk job and did not remember informing on anyone. While serving in the Internal Security Corps, Bauman first studied sociology at the Warsaw Academy of Political and Social Science. In 1953, Bauman, already in the rank of major, was suddenly dishonourably discharged, after his father had approached the Israeli embassy in Warsaw with a view to emigrating to Israel. As Bauman did not share his father&#x27;s Zionist tendencies and was indeed strongly anti-Zionist, his dismissal caused a severe, though temporary estrangement from his father. During the period of unemployment that followed, he completed his M.A. and in 1954 became a lecturer at the University of Warsaw, where he remained until 1968.

While at the London School of Economics, where his supervisor was Robert McKenzie, he prepared a comprehensive study on the British socialist movement, his first major book. Published originally in Polish in 1959, a revised edition appeared in English in 1972. Bauman went on to publish other books, including &quot;Socjologia na co dzień&quot; (&quot;Everyday Sociology&quot;, 1964), which reached a large popular audience in Poland and later formed the foundation for the English-language text-book &quot;Thinking Sociologically&quot; (1990). Initially, Bauman remained close to orthodox Marxist doctrine, but, influenced by Georg Simmel and Antonio Gramsci, he became increasingly critical of Poland&#x27;s Communist government. Owing to this he was never awarded a professorship even after he completed his habilitation. But after his former teacher, Julian Hochfeld, was made vice-director of UNESCO&#x27;s Department for Social Sciences in Paris in 1962, Bauman did in fact inherit Hochfeld&#x27;s chair.

Faced with increasing political pressure connected with a political purge led by Mieczysław Moczar, the Chief of the Polish Communist Security Police, Bauman renounced his membership of the governing Polish United Workers&#x27; Party in January 1968. The 1968 Polish political crisis culminated in a purge that drove many remaining Communist Poles of Jewish descent out of the country, including those intellectuals who had fallen from grace with the Communist government. Bauman, who had lost his chair at the University of Warsaw, was among them. He had to give up Polish citizenship to be allowed to leave the country.

In 1968, he went to Israel to teach at Tel Aviv University. In 1970, he moved to Great Britain, where he accepted the chair of sociology at the
University of Leeds. There he intermittently also served as head of the department. After his appointment, he published almost exclusively in English, his third language, and his reputation grew.
From the late 1990s, Bauman exerted a considerable influence on the anti- or alter-globalisation movement.

In a 2011 interview in the Polish weekly &quot;Polityka&quot;, Bauman criticised Zionism and Israel, saying Israel was not interested in peace and that it was &quot;taking advantage of the Holocaust to legitimize unconscionable acts&quot;. He expressed that &quot;the mission of the Holocaust survivors is to bring salvation to the world and to protect it from another catastrophe: to expose hidden but still vital evil tendencies in this world, in order to prevent a second disgrace to civilization.&quot; In this specific context, he compared the Israeli West Bank barrier to the walls of the Warsaw Ghetto, where thousands of Jews died in the Holocaust, but to emphasize that &quot;inflicting suffering degrades and morally destroys those who inflict suffering – and, contrary to belief, does not ennoble the suffering in the least.&quot; The Israeli ambassador to Poland, Zvi Bar, called Bauman&#x27;s comments &quot;half truths&quot; and &quot;groundless generalizations.&quot; Janina Bauman, the wife of Bauman, along with her sister Sophie and her mother Alina survived the slaughter of the Jews of Warsaw and the crushing of the Warsaw ghetto.

In 2013 Bauman made his first visit to Israel after he left it in 1970: he accepted an invitation offered by the Israeli Sociological Society to give a keynote lecture at the ISS Annual Meeting and conduct a seminar with Israeli PhD sociology students.

Bauman was a supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which advocates for democratic reform in the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system.

==Family==
Bauman was married to writer Janina Bauman, née Lewinson; 18 August 1926 – 29 December 2009. They had three daughters, painter Lydia Bauman, architect Irena Bauman, and professor Anna Sfard, a leading theorist of education at the University of Haifa. His grandson Michael Sfard is a prominent civil rights activist and author in Israel. Zygmunt Bauman died in Leeds on 9 January 2017.

==Work==
Bauman&#x27;s published work extends to 57 books and well over a hundred articles. Most of these address a number of common themes, among which are globalisation, modernity and postmodernity, consumerism, and morality.

===Early work===
Bauman&#x27;s earliest publication in English is a study of the British labour movement and its relationship to class and social stratification, originally published in Poland in 1960. He continued to publish on the subject of class and social conflict until the early 1980s. His last book was on the subject of &quot;Memories of Class&quot;. Whilst his later books do not address issues of class directly, he continued to describe himself as a socialist, and he never rejected Marxism entirely. The neo-Marxist theorist Antonio Gramsci in particular remained one of his most profound influences, along with Neo-Kantian sociologist and philosopher Georg Simmel.

===Modernity and rationality===

In the late 1980s and early 1990s Bauman published a number of books that dealt with the relationship between modernity, bureaucracy, rationality and social exclusion. Bauman, following Sigmund Freud, came to view European modernity as a trade off: European society, he argued, had agreed to forego a level of freedom to receive the benefits of increased individual security. Bauman argued that modernity, in what he later came to term its &#x27;solid&#x27; form, involved removing unknowns and uncertainties. It involved control over nature, hierarchical bureaucracy, rules and regulations, control and categorisation — all of which attempted to gradually remove personal insecurities, making the chaotic aspects of human life appear well-ordered and familiar.
Later in a number of books Bauman began to develop the position that such order-making never manages to achieve the desired results.

When life becomes organised into familiar and manageable categories, he argued, there are always social groups who cannot be administered, who cannot be separated out and controlled. In his book &quot;Modernity and Ambivalence&quot; Bauman began to theorise about such indeterminate persons in terms of an allegorical figure he called, &#x27;the stranger.&#x27; Drawing upon Georg Simmel&#x27;s sociology and the philosophy of Jacques Derrida, Bauman came to write of the stranger as the person who is present yet unfamiliar, society&#x27;s &quot;undecidable&quot;. In &quot;Modernity and Ambivalence&quot; Bauman attempted to give an account of the different approaches modern society adopts toward the stranger. He argued that, on the one hand, in a consumer-oriented economy the strange and the unfamiliar is always enticing; in different styles of food, different fashions and in tourism it is possible to experience the allure of what is unfamiliar. Yet this strange-ness also has a more negative side. The stranger, because he cannot be controlled or ordered, is always the object of fear; he is the potential mugger, the person outside of society&#x27;s borders who is a constant threat.

One of Bauman&#x27;s most famous books, &quot;Modernity and the Holocaust&quot;, is an attempt to give a full account of the dangers of those kinds of fears. Drawing upon Hannah Arendt and Theodor W. Adorno&#x27;s books on totalitarianism and the Enlightenment, Bauman developed the argument that the Holocaust should not simply be considered to be an event in Jewish history, nor a regression to pre-modern barbarism. Rather, he argued, the Holocaust should be seen as deeply connected to modernity and its order-making efforts. Procedural rationality, the division of labour into smaller and smaller tasks, the taxonomic categorisation of different species, and the tendency to view obedience to rules as morally good, all played their role in the Holocaust coming to pass. He argued that for this reason modern societies have not fully grasped the lessons of the Holocaust; it tends to be viewed—to use Bauman&#x27;s metaphor—like a picture hanging on the wall, offering few lessons. In Bauman&#x27;s analysis the Jews became &#x27;strangers&#x27; &quot;par excellence&quot; in Europe. The Final Solution was pictured by him as an extreme example of the attempt made by society to excise the uncomfortable and indeterminate elements that exist within it. Bauman, like the philosopher Giorgio Agamben, contended that the same processes of exclusion that were at work in the Holocaust could, and to an extent do, still come into play today.

===Postmodernity and consumerism===
In the mid-to-late 1990s, Bauman began to explore &quot;postmodernity&quot; and &quot;consumerism&quot;. He posited that a shift had taken place in modern society in the latter half of the 20th century. It had changed from a society of producers into a society of consumers. According to Bauman, this change reversed Freud&#x27;s &quot;modern&quot; tradeoff—i.e., security was given up in exchange for more freedom, freedom to purchase, consume, and enjoy life. In his books in the 1990s Bauman wrote of this as being a shift from &quot;modernity&quot; to &quot;post-modernity&quot;.

Since the turn of the millennium, his books have tried to avoid the confusion surrounding the term &quot;postmodernity&quot; by using the metaphors of &quot;liquid&quot; and &quot;solid&quot; modernity. In his books on modern consumerism, Bauman still writes of the same uncertainties that he portrayed in his writings on &quot;solid&quot; modernity; but in these books he writes of fears becoming more diffuse and harder to pin down. Indeed, they are, to use the title of one of his books, &quot;liquid fears&quot; – fears about paedophilia, for instance, which are amorphous and have no easily identifiable reference.

Bauman is credited with coining the term &quot;allosemitism&quot; to encompass both philo-Semitic and anti-Semitic attitudes towards Jews as the other. Bauman reportedly predicted the negative political effect that social media have on voter&#x27;s choice by denouncing them as &#x27;trap&#x27; where people only &quot;see reflections of their own face&quot;.

=== Art: a liquid element? ===

One of Bauman works focuses on the concept of art as influenced by the liquidity of appreciation. The author puts forward the idea that &quot;we desire and seek a realization that usually consists of a constant &quot;becoming&quot;, in a permanent disposition of &quot;becoming&quot;&quot;. In essence, our aim is not the object of our longing but the action of longing itself, and the worst peril is reaching complete satisfaction.

In this framework, Bauman explores how art can position itself in a world where the fleeting is the dominant paradigm. Art is substantially something that contributes to giving immortality to virtually anything: hence the philosopher wonders, &quot;can art transform the ephemeral into an eternal matter?&quot;. Bauman concludes that the current reality is characterized by individuals who do not have time nor space to relate with the everlasting, with absolute and established values. Art and the relation of people with them, both in creating it and in participating in it, is dramatically changing. Citing Hannah Arendt, he asserts that &quot;an object is cultural if it persists; its temporary aspect, its permanence, is opposite to the functional [...] culture sees itself threatened when all the objects in the world, those produced today and those of the past, are exclusively considered from the point of view of utility for the social process of survival&quot;. Withal, the concept of culture and art can only find a sense in the liquid society if it abandons its traditional understanding and adopts the deconstructive approach. Bauman gives as examples artworks by Manolo Valdés, Jacques Villeglé and Herman Braun-Vega.

==Awards and honours==
Bauman was awarded the European Amalfi Prize for Sociology and Social Sciences in 1992, the Theodor W. Adorno Award of the city of Frankfurt in 1998 and The VIZE 97 Prize in 2006. He was awarded in 2010, jointly with Alain Touraine, the Princess of Asturias Award for Communication and the Humanities.

The University of Leeds established &#x27;The Bauman Institute&#x27; within its School of Sociology and Social Policy in his honour in September 2010. The University of Lower Silesia, a small private higher education institution in Lower Silesia, Poland, planned to award Bauman an honorary doctorate in October 2013. However, as a response to a &quot;several antisemitic attacks via social media internet sites&quot; mixed with accusations of having a pro-socialist background against him by far-right groups, he eventually declined the doctorate.

In 2015 the University of Salento awarded Bauman an honorary degree in Modern Languages, Literature and Literary Translation.

==Plagiarism allegations==
In 2014, Peter Walsh, a PhD candidate at the University of Cambridge, accused Bauman of plagiarism from several websites, including Wikipedia, in his book &quot;Does the Richness of the Few Benefit Us All?&quot; (2013). In this book Bauman is said to have copied verbatim paragraphs from Wikipedia articles on Slow Food and steady-state economy, along with their bibliography, without attributing sources, authors or the fact that they were copied from Wikipedia. He did use a paragraph from the article on the golden handshake, but this citation was properly attributed to Wikipedia.

In a response, Bauman suggested that &quot;obedience&quot; to &quot;technical&quot; rules was unnecessary, and that he &quot;never once failed to acknowledge the authorship of the ideas or concepts that I deployed, or that inspired the ones I coined&quot;. In a detailed critique of Walsh and co-author David Lehmann, cultural critics Brad Evans and Henry Giroux concluded: &quot;This charge against Bauman is truly despicable. It&#x27;s a reactionary ideological critique dressed up as the celebration of method and a back-door defence of sterile empiricism and culture of positivism. This is a discourse that enshrines data, correlations, and performance, while eschewing matters of substance, social problems, and power.&quot;

<text>Our Lady of Peace, Mother of Peace, Queen of Peace or Our Lady Queen of Peace is a title of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the Roman Catholic Church. She is represented in art holding a dove and an olive branch, symbols of peace. Her official memorial in the General Roman Calendar is on July 9 in the universal Church except for Hawaii and some churches in the United States, where it is kept on January 24.

==History==
In 1482, Pope Sixtus IV commissioned the construction of the church of Santa Maria della Pace on the foundations of the old Sant&#x27;Andrea de Aquarizariis.

There are many papal encyclicals asking Mary to intercede for peace. During the troubled years of World War I, Pope Benedict XV added Our Lady of Peace to the Litany of Loreto.

===France===
The traditional story holds that in the early 1500s in France, a certain Jean de Joyeuse presented the statue as a wedding gift to his young bride, Françoise e Voisins. The statue was known as the &quot;Virgin of Joyeuse&quot;, and became a cherished family heirloom.

Around the year 1588, Jean&#x27;s grandson, Henri Joyeuse, joined the Capuchin Franciscans in Paris and brought the statue with him, where it remained for the next 200 years. With the olive branch in her hand and the Prince of Peace on her arm, the statue was called (Our Lady of Peace). In 1657 the Capuchin community erected a larger chapel to accommodate the growing number of faithful who sought her intercession. On July 9 that year, before a large crowd which included King Louis XIV, the papal nuncio to France blessed and solemnly enthroned the Virgin&#x27;s statue. Pope Alexander VII would later designate this date for the Capuchin community to celebrate the feast of Our Lady of Peace.

During the French Revolution, which erupted in 1789, the Capuchins were driven from their monastery. They took the image with them to prevent its destruction by the ransacking rebels. When peace was restored in the land, the statue was brought out of hiding and entrusted to Peter Coudrin, a priest in Paris. In 1800, Coudrin and Henriette Aymer de Chevalerie became co-founders of a community of sisters, brothers and priests – the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary and the Perpetual Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. The members were also known more simply as the Picpus Fathers or Sacred Hearts religious. Coudrin gave the statue to Mother Aymer, who enshrined it in a convent chapel in the Picpus district of Paris on May 6, 1806.

Excluding its pedestal, the figure of dark hardwood is 11 inches tall, and is fashioned in the Renaissance style of the period. Mary is depicted as a dignified matron, with the Christ Child on her left arm and an olive branch in her right hand.

===El Salvador===
Tradition holds that in 1682 merchants found an abandoned box on the shore of Mar del Sur in El Salvador. Unable to open it, they tied the box on the back of a donkey and departed to inform the local authorities of their find. When they were passing the parish church, now a cathedral, the donkey laid on the ground. They were then able to open the box and were surprised that it contained an image of Our Lady holding the Christ Child. It is said that a bloody conflict was being fought among inhabitants of the region; when they heard of the discovery they put down their weapons and immediately ceased fighting. This is why the image was given the title of Our Lady of Peace, whose liturgical celebration is November 21 in memory of its arrival in San Miguel.

Óscar Romero, a renowned Salvadoran saint and Bishop, promoted devotion to Our Lady of Peace.

The statue is a dressed wooden carving, with the national shield of El Salvador embroidered on the front of the image&#x27;s white robe. Our Lady holds a golden palm leaf in memory of the eruption of the Chaparrastique volcano, which threatened to destroy the city with burning lava. The frightened dwellers of San Miguel brought out the statue of Our Lady of Peace to the principal door of the cathedral, and immediately the flow of the lava changed direction to travel away from the city.

Pope Benedict XV authorized the canonical coronation of the image, which occurred on November 21, 1921.

==Patronage==

Our Lady of Peace is the patroness of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, founded by Peter Coudrin in Paris during the French Revolution. When the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary established the Catholic Church in Hawaii, they consecrated the Hawaiian Islands under the protection of Our Lady of Peace. They erected the first Roman Catholic church in Hawaii to her. Today, the Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace in Honolulu is the oldest Roman Catholic cathedral in continuous use in the United States.

There are three famous statues of Our Lady of Peace located in Paris and Honolulu. The original is a wooden carving located at a convent of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary in France. A larger replica in bronze was hoisted above the altar and sanctuary at the Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace, while a third stands on a pedestal outside the cathedral.

The original statue of Our Lady of Peace was ceremonially crowned on July 9, 1906, by the Archbishop of Paris in the name of Pope Pius X. Every July 9 since then, the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary have celebrated the Feast of Our Lady of Peace.

===Other shrines===
Pope John Paul II consecrated and dedicated the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire to Our Lady of Peace. It is the largest place of worship in Africa. Elsewhere throughout the world, there are parish churches named in honor of Our Lady of Peace in various forms, such as the parish of Our Lady of Peace in Brooklyn.

The EDSA Shrine in Metro Manila, the Philippines, is also dedicated to Our Lady of Peace. Located along EDSA, it commemorates the alleged role of the Virgin in the People Power Revolution of February 1986 that ended President Ferdinand Marcos&#x27; 21-year dictatorship. In the “Rosary miracle,” Mary is said to have shrouded the more than one million peaceful demonstrators on the highway from possible air attacks by troops loyal to Marcos; a mural inside the shrine&#x27;s nave depicts the &quot;miracle&quot;. The image associated with this particular shrine differs from traditional depictions of the title: Mary, crowned and clad in golden robes, has her arms outstretched, while several white doves surround her.

The Foujita Chapel in Reims, France, is dedicated to Our Lady, Queen of Peace, as a reaction to the horror and devastation caused by the 1945 atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by American forces towards the end of the Second World War.

The chapel at St. Edward&#x27;s University in Austin, Texas, is also dedicated to Our Lady Queen of Peace.

St. Mary, Queen of Peace Basilica is the pro-cathedral of the Syro-Malankara Catholic Major Archeparchy of Trivandrum in Kerala, India.

Queen of Peace Cemetery of the Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre in Old Westbury, New York opened in 2020.

Two Roman titular churches are dedicated to Mary Queen of Peace: Santa Maria Regina Pacis a Ostia Lido and Santa Maria Regina Pacis a Monte Verde.

<doc id="666222" wikidata="Q7454711" url="?curid=666222" title="Serializing tokens">
<text>In computer science, serializing tokens are a concept in concurrency control arising from the ongoing development of DragonFly BSD. According to Matthew Dillon, they are most akin to SPLs, except a token works across multiple CPUs while SPLs only work within a single CPU&#x27;s domain.

Serializing tokens allow programmers to write multiprocessor-safe code without themselves or the lower level subsystems needing to be aware of every single entity that may also be holding the same token. 

== Comparison with mutual exclusion (mutex) ==

Tokens and mutual exclusion (mutex) mechanisms are locks. Unlike mutexes, tokens do not exclude other threads from accessing the resource while they are blocked or asleep. A thread sharing resources with other threads can be stopped and started for a variety of reasons:
# Timeslicing: the user space (US) scheduler tries to ensure that all threads get a fair chance to run, so it runs each thread for a brief period of time (a timeslice) and then switches to another thread.
# Concurrent execution: in multiprocessor computers, a thread may be run at exactly the same time as another thread on a different CPU.
# Preemption: a thread may preempt a lower-priority thread, such as a hardware interrupt or Light Weight Kernel Threads.
# Voluntary blocking: a thread may sleep if it has to wait for something, has no work to do, or calls a function that blocks. Even the call to acquire a lock can block.

The following table summarizes the properties of tokens and mutexes.

Issues such as deadlock and priority inversion can be very difficult to avoid, and require coordination at many levels of the kernel. Because locking with tokens does not deadlock and acquired tokens need not be atomic when later operations block, it allow much simpler code than mutexes.


== Example == 
The following pseudocode and explanations illustrate how serializing tokens work.

== Prior art in the Darwin kernel ==
Mac OS X&#x27;s Darwin kernel uses a similar technique (called a funnel) to serialize access to the BSD portion of the kernel.

<doc id="666230" wikidata="Q483607" url="?curid=666230" title="Anacostia River">
<text>The Anacostia River is a river in the Mid Atlantic region of the United States. It flows from Prince George&#x27;s County in Maryland into Washington, D.C., where it joins with the Washington Channel and ultimately empties into the Potomac River at Buzzard Point. It is about 8.7 miles (14.0 km) long. The name &quot;Anacostia&quot; derives from the area&#x27;s early history as Nacotchtank, a settlement of Necostan or Anacostan Native Americans on the banks of the Anacostia River.

Heavy pollution in the Anacostia and weak investment and development along its banks made it &quot;D.C.&#x27;s forgotten river&quot;. More recently, however, private organizations; local businesses; and the D.C., Maryland, and federal governments have made efforts to reduce pollution and protect the ecologically valuable Anacostia watershed.

==Course==
The main stem of the Anacostia is formed by the confluence of the Northwest Branch and the Northeast Branch just north of Cottage City, Maryland. Tributaries of these sources include Sligo Creek, Paint Branch, Little Paint Branch, Indian Creek, Upper Beaverdam Creek, Dueling Branch, and Brier&#x27;s Mill Run. Tributaries of the main stem Anacostia include Watts Branch, Lower Beaverdam Creek, and Hickory Run.

==Watershed==
The watershed of the river covers roughly in eastern Montgomery County and northern Prince George&#x27;s County, as well as most of the eastern half of Washington, D.C.

==History==
Captain John Smith recorded in his journals that he sailed up the &quot;Eastern Branch&quot; or Anacostia River, in 1608 in his search for the main branch of the Potomac River and was well received by the Anacostans. On earlier maps, the river was known as the &quot;Eastern Branch of the Potomac River&quot; until it received its current, official name. In the mid-1600s, the name &quot;Annacostin River&quot; was applied to the stretch of the Potomac River north of Oxon Creek up to the vicinity of present-day Washington where the confluence with the modern Anacostia (then called the Eastern Branch or St. Isidora&#x27;s Creek) and St. James Creek formed a natural harbor called St. Thomas&#x27;s Bay.

The Washington City Canal operated from 1815 until the mid-1850s, initially connecting the Anacostia to Tiber Creek and the Potomac River; and later to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. The city canal fell into disuse in the late 19th century, and the city government covered over or filled in various sections.
During the American Civil War, an extensive line of forts was constructed south of the river in order to prevent Confederate artillery from bombarding the Washington Navy Yard, which abuts the river.

== Pollution ==
One of the biggest problems facing the Anacostia River is raw sewage that enters the river and its tributaries. During rainstorms, the river receives discharges of untreated sewage due to the city&#x27;s antiquated combined sewer system. The sewage creates a public health threat because of fecal coliform bacteria and other pathogens; it also impairs water quality and can create hypoxic conditions that lead to large fish kills.

According to Rianna Murray et al. and a study from the NOAA Office of Response and Restoration, many citizens living along the Anacostia River have been exposed to water pollution. One study done on recreational exposure to pollution along the river showed that many people reported &quot;exposure to water while canoeing, kayaking, rowing, rafting, and paddling, and members of this group also reported getting water in their mouth while recreating.&quot; This exposure to polluted water has potential adverse effects on the health of individuals and their community.

The Anacostia Watershed Society (AWS) sued the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority (DCWASA) in 1999 for allowing more than of combined sewage and urban runoff (stormwater) to flow into the river via its antiquated combined sewer overflow system. In settling the lawsuit, WASA agreed to invest $140 million on pump station rehabilitation, pipe cleaning and maintenance and public notices of overflows.

In late 2004, AWS and other organizations announced plans to sue the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (WSSC), the sewage authority in Maryland, over similar problems with river contamination from the Maryland suburbs. According to WSSC, more than of raw sewage were released into Anacostia tributaries between January 2001 and June 2004.

=== Mitigation of sewage overflows ===
Under a stormwater discharge permit issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the D.C. government is implementing a stormwater management program to improve water quality in the Anacostia. The governments of Montgomery County and Prince George&#x27;s County also operate stormwater management programs.

In response to the litigation, in 2011 DCWASA began building a large system of sewage storage tunnels to reduce combined sewer overflow. Four deep storage tunnels next to the Anacostia and Potomac Rivers will reduce overflows to the Anacostia by 98 percent, and 96 percent system-wide. The first segment of the tunnel system, in length, opened in 2018. (The city&#x27;s overall &quot;Clean Rivers&quot; project, projected to cost $2.6 billion, includes other components, such as reducing stormwater flows.) The remaining segments of the Anacostia storage system were completed in September 2023 and will reduce sewage overflows by 98 percent. The major structure is a long, diameter reinforced concrete tunnel, buried approximately 80 to 120 feet deep. The overall Clean Rivers project will comprise over of tunnels with a storage capacity of .

=== PCB contamination ===
Another large source of river pollution is the Washington Navy Yard, which is sited alongside the river and is believed to be a source of PCB contaminants in the river and sediment.

=== Litter control ===

In May 2009, a Bandalong Litter Trap floating litter-control system was placed in the Watts Branch tributary of the Anacostia River as part of Mayor Adrian Fenty&#x27;s &quot;Green DC Agenda.&quot; In its first year of operation, it removed more than of floatable litter per month from the river.

=== Mussel project ===
Since 2018, thousands of mussels have been placed in the Anacostia in an effort to reduce the impact of urban runoff, PCBs, and microplastics on river water quality and overall river health.  This effort has happened in conjunction with a movement to make the river a popular local water recreation site.

Mussels, which are filter feeders, have a strong capability to clean water.  The Anacostia Watershed Society estimates that the mussels have already purified 32 million gallons of water in the first year of this project.

The pilot project began in 2018 when the Anacostia Watershed Society harvested 9,000 quarter-sized mussels and placed them in the river in protective baskets.  In 2019, after 92% of the mussels survived the first year of the project, the D.C. Department of Energy and Environment (DOEE) gave the watershed society a $400,000 grant to put another 35,000 mussels in the river.  Half of this funding came from the federal government, and the other half came from a five cent tax on plastic bags in the District.

This project came at an especially important moment for Anacostia River health, as the D.C. area weathered intense rain in 2018 which contributed to much sediment, waste, and organic material flowing into the river. River health has improved since, as noted in the watershed society&#x27;s 2019 river report card.  The Anacostia earned its second-best-ever grade in the 2019 State of the Anacostia Report Card, but still failed the evaluation, earning a 51 percent.

Swimming or wading in the Anacostia became illegal in 1971. However, as of 2019, city officials are considering changing this law and building public river pools.  DOEE Director Tommy Wells said, “I believe we will have swimming platforms in Washington, D.C. by 2025.&quot; 

Freshwater mussels have tougher meat than saltwater mussels, so local restaurants are unlikely to buy them. “Without commercial demand for freshwater mussels, funding for their restoration hinges on proof of their ability to save rivers,&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported in 2019.

==Recreational amenities==

The Bladensburg Waterfront Park, part of the Prince George&#x27;s County Department of Parks and Recreation, currently occupies the banks of the Anacostia near Alternate Route 1. The Port Towns Community Boathouse at the park is home to public boat and bike rentals, a public boat ramp and dock, as well as the rowing crews of the University of Maryland, The Catholic University of America, a community rowing school, and several local high schools.

The Anacostia Riverwalk Trail (partially complete as of June 2016) connects Bladensburg Waterfront Park the Tidal Basin via of paved, shared-use path with connections and spurs to the National Arboretum, Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens, Nationals Park, Maine Avenue Fish Market, and other locations.

<text>The Office of Science and Technology (OST), later (briefly) named the Office of Science and Innovation, was a non-ministerial government department of the British government between 1992 and 2007.

The office was responsible for co-ordination of the government&#x27;s science and technology related activities and policies, and the distribution of some £2.4 billion among the seven UK Research Councils. It was headed by the Chief Scientific Adviser; initially this was Sir William Stewart, then Sir Robert May (later Lord May of Oxford), and finally Sir David King.

The OST was originally formed in 1992 as a merger of the Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser with the Science Branch of the Department of Education and Science (as it then was). Although originally run under the Cabinet Office, it was moved between departments in 1995 to operate under the Department of Trade and Industry. In early 2006, the office was renamed to the Office of Science and Innovation and was subsequently absorbed into the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills in the Summer of 2007 when the Department for Education and Skills was split in two.

The Government Chief Scientific Advisor now heads the Government Office for Science.

<doc id="666248" wikidata="Q7728078" url="?curid=666248" title="The Criminals (band)">
<text>The Criminals are an American punk rock band from Berkeley, California, originally existing from 1994–2000 and reforming in 2012. The lineup has consisted of lead vocalist Jesse Luscious and bass guitarist Mike Sexxx throughout the bands&#x27; existence. The Criminals have released two studio albums, &quot;Never Been Caught&quot; (1997) on Lookout! Records and &quot;Burning Flesh and Broken Fingers&quot; (1999) on Adeline Records. Following their initial breakup in 2000, members went on to form the Frisk.

==History==
===Formation, early releases and touring (1994–1997)===
The Criminals formed in late 1994 with Jesse Luscious (vocals) and Mike Sexxx (bass), as well as vocalist Claudia Bitter, guitarist Freud RIP and drummer Ross the Boss. Initially, The Criminals sound was in a similar vein of Luscious&#x27; previous bands Blatz and The Gr&#x27;ups, which were also aggressively fronted, male/female dual-vocal punk rock bands. They issued the 7&quot; vinyl release &quot;Seven Months Drunk and Bitter&quot; on Seattle&#x27;s Hairhurt Records, with cover art by Janelle Hessig, known for producing the &quot;Tales of Blarg&quot; zine. Bitter left the band to move back to El Paso, Texas prior to seeing a release.

The Criminals continued as a four-piece and in early 1995 embarked on their first West Coast tour with Area 51, who would eventually become The Murder City Devils. They played the Los Angeles area frequently with the likes of the Quincy Punx and I Spy, courtesy of friend and former F.Y.P bassist Jed Schipper. Shortly after, the band was offered a release on Recess Records, a label run by Todd Congelliere (also of F.Y.P), which would result in &quot;The Criminals&quot; 10&quot;, recorded in August 1995 at Polymorph Studios in Oakland, California by Noah Landis. The release would include a cover of &quot;Private Affair,&quot; originally performed by The Saints. The Criminals toured behind the release in the summer of 1996. Ross left the band to focus on his grindcore bands (Skaven, followed by Medication Time) and was temporarily replaced by Snapper, until he too became homesick and moved back to his native Grand Rapids, Michigan.

The Criminals found their next drummer Dan Ger, and made another lineup change following the band&#x27;s 1996 summer tour, when Freud was kicked out and replaced by guitarist Brady Caesar. They continued to tour the US and Canada that year. This lineup would record and release The Criminals&#x27; debut album, &quot;Never Been Caught&quot; issued on Lookout! Records. The album was recorded at Catbox Studios in Oakland, California in January 1997 and was engineered by Billie Joe Armstrong, with cover art by Jesse Michaels. The song &quot;Parlez-Vous Fuk You?&quot; was re-recorded for the album, despite originally appearing on the bands&#x27; self-titled release.

===&quot;Burning Flesh&quot; and initial breakup (1998–2000)===
In April 1998 The Criminals recorded the EP &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Too Late&quot;, released on New Disorder Records later that year. The band had yet another drummer change when they recruited Julie Thorn, formerly of The Hi-Fives. The Criminals returned to Catbox Studios in the spring of 1999 to record their second album, &quot;Burning Flesh and Broken Fingers&quot;. The band again worked with Armstrong, who recorded the session and released it on his recently launched Adeline Records. The song &quot;Whiskey Business&quot; was co-written with Matt Freeman. Following the album&#x27;s release, Caesar left the band to focus on Black Cat Music and was replaced with guitarist Zach Attack. The band backed the release with a US tour featuring Blanks 77 and L.E.S. Stitches. Several unreleased songs from the &quot;Burning Flesh&quot; sessions would see later release on &quot;Exchange&quot;, a split release with Against All Authority.

The Criminals played their final show on January 29, 2000 at 924 Gilman Street in Berkeley, California with The Hi-Fives. They issued the posthumous EP &quot;Extinct&quot; on F.O.A.D. Records in 2001. The recording took place in December 1999, just before the band&#x27;s dissolution and included re-recorded versions of &quot;The Angry Ouija Board Has Sent Us to Destroy the City of Berkeley California So Run for Your Fucking Life&quot; and &quot;You Stupid Fuk,&quot; as well as a cover of &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long,&quot; originally performed by AC/DC.

==Post breakup and reunion==
Following The Criminals demise in early 2000, members went on to form The Frisk. The lineup included drummer Hunter Burgan, who has also been the bassist for AFI since 1997. The Frisk issued two releases on Adeline Records, who had previously released The Criminals final studio album, before disbanding in 2005.

In early 2012, The Criminals reformed as a four-piece and participated in the 1-2-3-4 Go! Records Celebration Night No. 1 with American Steel, Dead to Me and Vanna Inget on May 24, 2012. The band went on to play The Fest in Gainesville and Awesomefest in San Diego, along with 924 Gilman Street, all in 2012. The main difference between this and any other incarnation is that while Jesse Luscious and Brady Ceasar are still in the band, this lineup features new bassist Nice Guy Brandon from Scattered Fall and drummer Markley Hart from Econochrist.

In 2013, the band has booked 1 show at Eli&#x27;s Mile High Club in October with new drummer Frank Piegaro of The Degenerics, Ensign, Star Fucking Hipsters, and Love Songs. More dates are pending. The Criminals next show was January 17, 2014 at The Hemlock Tavern in San Francisco with original San Francisco punk era band VKTMS.

On January 12, 2015, the Criminals announced their &quot;last show ever&quot;. The show was on January 22, 2015 at the DNA lounge in San Francisco. Great Apes were opening and Jello Biafra DJ&#x27;d throughout the night. The Criminals include Jello&#x27;s consigliere, Alternative Tentacles Records&#x27; Jesse Luscious.

<doc id="666256" wikidata="Q326498" url="?curid=666256" title="Competition law">
<text>Competition law is the field of law that promotes or seeks to maintain market competition by regulating anti-competitive conduct by companies. Competition law is implemented through public and private enforcement. It is also known as antitrust law (or just antitrust), anti-monopoly law, and trade practices law; the act of pushing for antitrust measures or attacking monopolistic companies (known as trusts) is commonly known as trust busting.

The history of competition law reaches back to the Roman Empire. The business practices of market traders, guilds and governments have always been subject to scrutiny, and sometimes severe sanctions. Since the 20th century, competition law has become global. The two largest and most influential systems of competition regulation are United States antitrust law and European Union competition law. National and regional competition authorities across the world have formed international support and enforcement networks.

Modern competition law has historically evolved on a national level to promote and maintain fair competition in markets principally within the territorial boundaries of nation-states. National competition law usually does not cover activity beyond territorial borders unless it has significant effects at nation-state level. Countries may allow for extraterritorial jurisdiction in competition cases based on so-called &quot;effects doctrine&quot;. The protection of international competition is governed by international competition agreements. In 1945, during the negotiations preceding the adoption of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947, limited international competition obligations were proposed within the &quot;Charter for an International Trade Organisation&quot;. These obligations were not included in GATT, but in 1994, with the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of GATT multilateral negotiations, the World Trade Organization (WTO) was created. The &quot;Agreement Establishing the WTO&quot; included a range of limited provisions on various cross-border competition issues on a sector specific basis. Competition law has failed to prevent monopolization of economic activity. &quot;The global economy is dominated by a handful of powerful transnational corporations (TNCs). ... Only 737 top holders accumulate 80% of the control over the value of all ... network control is much more unequally distributed than wealth. In particular, the top ranked actors hold a control ten times bigger than what could be expected based on their wealth. ... Recent works have shown that when a financial network is very densely connected it is prone to systemic risk. Indeed, while in good times the network is seemingly robust, in bad times firms go into distress simultaneously. This knife-edge property was witnessed during the recent (2009) financial turmoil &quot;

==Starting Point==
Competition law, or antitrust law, has three main elements:
* prohibiting agreements or practices that restrict free trading and competition between business. This includes in particular the repression of free trade caused by cartels.
* banning abusive behavior by a firm dominating a market, or anti-competitive practices that tend to lead to such a dominant position. Practices controlled in this way may include predatory pricing, tying, price gouging, and refusal to deal.
* supervising the mergers and acquisitions of large corporations, including some joint ventures. Transactions that are considered to threaten the competitive process can be prohibited altogether, or approved subject to &quot;remedies&quot; such as an obligation to divest part of the merged business or to offer licenses or access to facilities to enable other businesses to continue competing.

Substance and practice of competition law varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Protecting the interests of consumers (consumer welfare) and ensuring that entrepreneurs have an opportunity to compete in the market economy are often treated as important objectives. Competition law is closely connected with law on deregulation of access to markets, state aids and subsidies, the privatization of state owned assets and the establishment of independent sector regulators, among other market-oriented supply-side policies. In recent decades, competition law has been viewed as a way to provide better public services. Robert Bork argued that competition laws can produce adverse effects when they reduce competition by protecting inefficient competitors and when costs of legal intervention are greater than benefits for the consumers.

==History==
===Roman legislation===
An early example was enacted during the Roman Republic around 50 BC. To protect the grain trade, heavy fines were imposed on anyone directly, deliberately, and insidiously stopping supply ships. Under Diocletian in 301 A.D., an edict imposed the death penalty for anyone violating a tariff system, for example by buying up, concealing, or contriving the scarcity of everyday goods. More legislation came under the constitution of Zeno of 483 A.D., which can be traced into Florentine municipal laws of 1322 and 1325. This provided for confiscation of property and banishment for any trade combination or joint action of monopolies private &quot;or&quot; granted by the Emperor. Zeno rescinded all previously granted exclusive rights. Justinian I subsequently introduced legislation to pay officials to manage state monopolies.

===Middle Ages===
Legislation in England to control monopolies and restrictive practices was in force well before the Norman Conquest. The Domesday Book recorded that &quot;foresteel&quot; (i.e. forestalling, the practice of buying up goods before they reach market and then inflating the prices) was one of three forfeitures that King Edward the Confessor could carry out through England. But concern for fair prices also led to attempts to directly regulate the market. Under Henry III an act was passed in 1266 to fix bread and ale prices in correspondence with grain prices laid down by the assizes. Penalties for breach included amercements, pillory and tumbrel. A 14th-century statute labelled forestallers as &quot;oppressors of the poor and the community at large and enemies of the whole country&quot;. Under King Edward III the Statute of Labourers of 1349 fixed wages of artificers and workmen and decreed that foodstuffs should be sold at reasonable prices. On top of existing penalties, the statute stated that overcharging merchants must pay the injured party double the sum he received, an idea that has been replicated in punitive treble damages under US antitrust law. Also under Edward III, the following statutory provision outlawed trade combination.

In continental Europe, competition principles developed in . Examples of legislation enshrining competition principles include the &quot;constitutiones juris metallici&quot; by Wenceslaus II of Bohemia between 1283 and 1305, condemning combination of ore traders increasing prices; the Municipal Statutes of Florence in 1322 and 1325 followed Zeno&#x27;s legislation against state monopolies; and under Emperor Charles V in the Holy Roman Empire a law was passed &quot;to prevent losses resulting from monopolies and improper contracts which many merchants and artisans made in the Netherlands&quot;. In 1553, Henry VIII of England reintroduced tariffs for foodstuffs, designed to stabilize prices, in the face of fluctuations in supply from overseas. So the legislation read here that whereas,

Around this time organizations representing various tradesmen and handicrafts people, known as guilds had been developing, and enjoyed many concessions and exemptions from the laws against monopolies. The privileges conferred were not abolished until the Municipal Corporations Act 1835.

===Early competition law in Europe===

The English common law of restraint of trade is the direct predecessor to modern competition law later developed in the US. It is based on the prohibition of agreements that ran counter to public policy, unless the reasonableness of an agreement could be shown. It effectively prohibited agreements designed to restrain another&#x27;s trade. The 1414 &quot;Dyer&#x27;s&quot; is the first known restrictive trade agreement to be examined under English common law. A dyer had given a bond not to exercise his trade in the same town as the plaintiff for six months but the plaintiff had promised nothing in return. On hearing the plaintiff&#x27;s attempt to enforce this restraint, Hull J exclaimed, &quot;per Dieu, if the plaintiff were here, he should go to prison until he had paid a fine to the King&quot;. The court denied the collection of a bond for the dyer&#x27;s breach of agreement because the agreement was held to be a restriction on trade. English courts subsequently decided a range of cases which gradually developed competition related case law, which eventually were transformed into statute law.
Europe around the 16th century was changing quickly. The new world had just been opened up, overseas trade and plunder was pouring wealth through the international economy and attitudes among businessmen were shifting. In 1561 a system of Industrial Monopoly Licenses, similar to modern patents had been introduced into England. But by the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, the system was reputedly heavily abused and used merely to preserve privileges. It did not promote innovation or help improve manufacturing. In response English courts developed case law on restrictive business practices. The statute followed the unanimous decision in &quot;Darcy v. Allein&quot; 1602, also known as the Case of Monopolies, of the King&#x27;s Bench to declare void the sole right that Queen Elizabeth I had granted to Darcy to import playing cards into England. Darcy, an officer of the Queen&#x27;s household, claimed damages for the defendant&#x27;s infringement of this right. The court found the grant void and that three characteristics of monopoly were (1) price increase, (2) quality decrease, (3) the rise in unemployment and destitution among artificers. This put an end to granted monopolies until King James I began to grant them again. In 1623 Parliament passed the Statute of Monopolies, which for the most part excluded patent rights from its prohibitions, as well as guilds. From King Charles I, through the civil war and to King Charles II, monopolies continued, especially useful for raising revenue. Then in 1684, in &quot;East India Company v. Sandys&quot; it was decided that exclusive rights to trade only outside the realm were legitimate, on the grounds that only large and powerful concerns could trade in the conditions prevailing overseas.

The development of early competition law in England and Europe progressed with the diffusion of writings such as &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; by Adam Smith, who first established the concept of the &quot;market economy&quot;. At the same time industrialisation replaced the individual artisan, or group of artisans, with paid labourers and machine-based production. Commercial success became increasingly dependent on maximizing production while minimizing cost. Therefore, the size of a company became increasingly important, and a number of European countries responded by enacting laws to regulate large companies that restricted trade. Following the French Revolution in 1789 the law of 14–17 June 1791 declared agreements by members of the same trade that fixed the price of an industry or labour as void, unconstitutional, and hostile to liberty. Similarly, the Austrian Penal Code of 1852 established that &quot;agreements ... to raise the price of a commodity ... to the disadvantage of the public should be punished as misdemeanours&quot;. Austria passed a law in 1870 abolishing the penalties, though such agreements remained void. However, in Germany laws clearly validated agreements between firms to raise prices. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, ideas that dominant private companies or legal monopolies could excessively restrict trade were further developed in Europe. However, as in the late 19th century, a depression spread through Europe, known as the Panic of 1873, ideas of competition lost favour, and it was felt that companies had to co-operate by forming cartels to withstand huge pressures on prices and profits.

==Modern competition law==
While the development of competition law stalled in Europe during the late 19th century, in 1889 Canada enacted what is considered the first competition statute of modern times. The &quot;Act for the Prevention and Suppression of Combinations formed in restraint of Trade&quot; was passed one year before the United States enacted the most famous legal statute on competition law, the Sherman Act of 1890. It was named after Senator John Sherman who argued that the Act &quot;does not announce a new principle of law, but applies old and well recognised principles of common law&quot;.

===United States antitrust===
The Sherman Act of 1890 attempted to outlaw the restriction of competition by large companies, who co-operated with rivals to fix outputs, prices and market shares, initially through &quot;pools&quot; and later through &quot;trusts&quot;. Trusts first appeared in the US railroads, where the capital requirement of railroad construction precluded competitive services in then scarcely settled territories. This trust allowed railroads to discriminate on rates imposed and services provided to consumers and businesses and to destroy potential competitors. Different trusts could be dominant in different industries. The Standard Oil Company trust in the 1880s controlled several markets, including the market in fuel oil, lead and whiskey. Vast numbers of citizens became sufficiently aware and publicly concerned about how the trusts negatively impacted them that the Act became a priority for both major parties. A primary concern of this act is that competitive markets themselves should provide the primary regulation of prices, outputs, interests and profits. Instead, the Act outlawed anticompetitive practices, codifying the common law restraint of trade doctrine. Rudolph Peritz has argued that competition law in the United States has evolved around two sometimes conflicting concepts of competition: first that of individual liberty, free of government intervention, and second a fair competitive environment free of excessive economic power. Since the enactment of the Sherman Act enforcement of competition law has been based on various economic theories adopted by Government.

Section 1 of the Sherman Act declared illegal &quot;every contract, in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations.&quot; Section 2 prohibits monopolies, or attempts and conspiracies to monopolize. Following the enactment in 1890 US court applies these principles to business and markets. Courts applied the Act without consistent economic analysis until 1914, when it was complemented by the Clayton Act which specifically prohibited exclusive dealing agreements, particularly tying agreements and interlocking directorates, and mergers achieved by purchasing stock. From 1915 onwards the &quot;rule of reason&quot; analysis was frequently applied by courts to competition cases. However, the period was characterized by the lack of competition law enforcement. From 1936 to 1972 courts&#x27; application of antitrust law was dominated by the &quot;structure-conduct-performance&quot; paradigm of the Harvard School. From 1973 to 1991, the enforcement of antitrust law was based on efficiency explanations as the Chicago School became dominant, and through legal writings such as Judge Robert Bork&#x27;s book &quot;The Antitrust Paradox&quot;. Since 1992 game theory has frequently been used in antitrust cases.

With the Hart–Scott–Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, mergers and acquisitions came into additional scrutiny from U.S. regulators. Under the act, parties must make a pre-merger notification to the U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission prior to the completion of a transaction. As of February 2, 2021, the FTC reduced the Hart-Scott-Rodino reporting threshold to $92 million in combined assets for the transaction.

===European Union law===

Competition law gained new recognition in Europe in the inter-war years, with Germany enacting its first anti-cartel law in 1923 and Sweden and Norway adopting similar laws in 1925 and 1926 respectively. However, with the Great Depression of 1929 competition law disappeared from Europe and was revived following the Second World War when the United Kingdom and Germany, following pressure from the United States, became the first European countries to adopt fully fledged competition laws. At a regional level EU competition law has its origins in the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) agreement between France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Germany in 1951 following the Second World War. The agreement aimed to prevent Germany from re-establishing dominance in the production of coal and steel as it was felt that this dominance had contributed to the outbreak of the war. Article 65 of the agreement banned cartels and article 66 made provisions for concentrations, or mergers, and the abuse of a dominant position by companies. This was the first time that competition law principles were included in a plurilateral regional agreement and established the trans-European model of competition law. In 1957 competition rules were included in the Treaty of Rome, also known as the EC Treaty, which established the European Economic Community (EEC). The Treaty of Rome established the enactment of competition law as one of the main aims of the EEC through the &quot;institution of a system ensuring that competition in the common market is not distorted&quot;. The two central provisions on EU competition law on companies were established in article 85, which prohibited anti-competitive agreements, subject to some exemptions, and article 86 prohibiting the abuse of dominant position. The treaty also established principles on competition law for member states, with article 90 covering public undertakings, and article 92 making provisions on state aid. Regulations on mergers were not included as member states could not establish consensus on the issue at the time.

Today, the Treaty of Lisbon prohibits anti-competitive agreements in Article 101(1), including price fixing. According to Article 101(2) any such agreements are automatically void. Article 101(3) establishes exemptions, if the collusion is for distributional or technological innovation, gives consumers a &quot;fair share&quot; of the benefit and does not include unreasonable restraints that risk eliminating competition anywhere (or compliant with the general principle of European Union law of proportionality). Article 102 prohibits the abuse of dominant position, such as price discrimination and exclusive dealing. Regulation 139/2004/EC governs mergers between firms. The general test is whether a concentration (i.e. merger or acquisition) with a community dimension (i.e. affects a number of EU member states) might significantly impede effective competition. Articles 106 and 107 provide that member state&#x27;s right to deliver public services may not be obstructed, but that otherwise public enterprises must adhere to the same competition principles as companies. Article 107 lays down a general rule that the state may not aid or subsidize private parties in distortion of free competition and provides exemptions for charities, regional development objectives and in the event of a natural disaster.

Leading ECJ cases on competition law include &quot;Consten &amp; Grundig v Commission&quot; and &quot;United Brands v Commission&quot;.

===India===
India responded positively by opening up its economy by removing controls during the Economic liberalisation. In quest of increasing the efficiency of the nation&#x27;s economy, the Government of India acknowledged the Liberalization Privatization Globalization era. As a result, Indian market faces competition from within and outside the country. This led to the need of a strong legislation to dispense justice in commercial matters and the Competition Act, 2002 was passed. The history of competition law in India dates back to the 1960s when the first competition law, namely the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act (MRTP) was enacted in 1969. But after the economic reforms in 1991, this legislation was found to be obsolete in many aspects and as a result, a new competition law in the form of the Competition Act, 2002 was enacted in 2003. The Competition Commission of India, is the quasi judicial body established for enforcing provisions of the Competition Act.

===China===
The Anti Monopoly Law of China came into effect in 2008. For years, it was enforced by three different branches of government, but since 2018 its enforcement has been the responsibility of the State Administration for Market Regulation. The &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; reported that the law had generated 11 billion RMB of penalties between 2008 and 2018.

===International expansion===
By 2008, 111 countries had enacted competition laws, which is more than 50 percent of countries with a population exceeding 80,000 people. 81 of the 111 countries had adopted their competition laws in the past 20 years, signaling the spread of competition law following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the expansion of the European Union. Currently competition authorities of many states closely co-operate, on everyday basis, with foreign counterparts in their enforcement efforts, also in such key area as information / evidence sharing.

In many of Asia&#x27;s developing countries, including India, Competition law is considered a tool to stimulate economic growth. In Korea and Japan, the competition law prevents certain forms of conglomerates. In addition, competition law has promoted fairness in China and Indonesia as well as international integration in Vietnam. Hong Kong&#x27;s Competition Ordinance came into force in the year 2015.

=== ASEAN member states ===
As part of the creation of the ASEAN Economic Community, the member states of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) pledged to enact competition laws and policies by the end of 2015. Today, all ten member states have general competition legislation in place. While there remains differences between regimes (for example, over merger control notification rules, or leniency policies for whistle-blowers), and it is unlikely that there will be a supranational competition authority for ASEAN (akin to the European Union), there is a clear trend towards increase in infringement investigations or decisions on cartel enforcement.

==Enforcement==
Competition law is enforced at the national level through competition authorities, as well as private enforcement. The United States Supreme Court explained:

In the European Union, the so-called &quot;Modernisation Regulation&quot;, Regulation 1/2003, established that the European Commission was no longer the only body capable of public enforcement of European Union competition law. This was done to facilitate quicker resolution of competition-related inquiries. In 2005 the Commission issued a Green Paper on &quot;Damages actions for the breach of the EC antitrust rules&quot;, which suggested ways of making private damages claims against cartels easier.

Some EU Member States enforce their competition laws with criminal sanctions. As analysed by Whelan, these types of sanctions engender a number of significant theoretical, legal and practical challenges.

Antitrust administration and legislation can be seen as a balance between:
* guidelines which are clear and specific to the courts, regulators and business but leave little room for discretion that prevents the application of laws from resulting in unintended consequences.
* guidelines which are broad, hence allowing administrators to sway between improving economic outcomes versus succumbing to political policies to redistribute wealth.

Chapter 5 of the post-war Havana Charter contained an Antitrust code but this was never incorporated into the WTO&#x27;s forerunner, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1947. Office of Fair Trading Director and Richard Whish wrote sceptically that it &quot;seems unlikely at the current stage of its development that the WTO will metamorphose into a global competition authority&quot;. Despite that, at the ongoing Doha round of trade talks for the World Trade Organization, discussion includes the prospect of competition law enforcement moving up to a global level. While it is incapable of enforcement itself, the newly established International Competition Network (ICN) is a way for national authorities to coordinate their own enforcement activities.

==Theory==
===Classical perspective===
Under the doctrine of laissez-faire, antitrust is seen as unnecessary as competition is viewed as a long-term dynamic process where firms compete against each other for market dominance. In some markets, a firm may successfully dominate, but it is because of superior skill or innovativeness. However, according to laissez-faire theorists, when it tries to raise prices to take advantage of its monopoly position it creates profitable opportunities for others to compete. A process of creative destruction begins which erodes the monopoly. Therefore, government should not try to break up monopoly but should allow the market to work.
The classical perspective on competition was that certain agreements and business practice could be an unreasonable restraint on the individual liberty of tradespeople to carry on their livelihoods. Restraints were judged as permissible or not by courts as new cases appeared and in the light of changing business circumstances. Hence the courts found specific categories of agreement, specific clauses, to fall foul of their doctrine on economic fairness, and they did not contrive an overarching conception of market power. Earlier theorists like Adam Smith rejected any monopoly power on this basis.

In &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; (1776) Adam Smith also pointed out the cartel problem, but did not advocate specific legal measures to combat them.

By the latter half of the 19th century, it had become clear that large firms had become a fact of the market economy. John Stuart Mill&#x27;s approach was laid down in his treatise &quot;On Liberty&quot; (1859).

===Neo-classical synthesis===
After Mill, there was a shift in economic theory, which emphasized a more precise and theoretical model of competition. A simple neo-classical model of free markets holds that production and distribution of goods and services in competitive free markets maximizes social welfare. This model assumes that new firms can freely enter markets and compete with existing firms, or to use legal language, there are no barriers to entry. By this term economists mean something very specific, that competitive free markets deliver allocative, productive and dynamic efficiency. Allocative efficiency is also known as Pareto efficiency after the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto and means that resources in an economy over the long run will go precisely to those who are willing and able to pay for them. Because rational producers will keep producing and selling, and buyers will keep buying up to the last marginal unit of possible output – or alternatively rational producers will be reduce their output to the margin at which buyers will buy the same amount as produced – there is no waste, the greatest number wants of the greatest number of people become satisfied and utility is perfected because resources can no longer be reallocated to make anyone better off without making someone else worse off; society has achieved allocative efficiency. Productive efficiency simply means that society is making as much as it can. Free markets are meant to reward those who work hard, and therefore those who will put society&#x27;s resources towards the frontier of its possible production. Dynamic efficiency refers to the idea that business which constantly competes must research, create and innovate to keep its share of consumers. This traces to Austrian-American political scientist Joseph Schumpeter&#x27;s notion that a &quot;perennial gale of creative destruction&quot; is ever sweeping through capitalist economies, driving enterprise at the market&#x27;s mercy. This led Schumpeter to argue that monopolies did not need to be broken up (as with Standard Oil) because the next gale of economic innovation would do the same.

Contrasting with the allocatively, productively and dynamically efficient market model are monopolies, oligopolies, and cartels. When only one or a few firms exist in the market, and there is no credible threat of the entry of competing firms, prices rise above the competitive level, to either a monopolistic or oligopolistic equilibrium price. Production is also decreased, further decreasing social welfare by creating a deadweight loss. Sources of this market power are said to include the existence of externalities, barriers to entry of the market, and the free rider problem. Markets may fail to be efficient for a variety of reasons, so the exception of competition law&#x27;s intervention to the rule of &quot;laissez faire&quot; is justified if government failure can be avoided. Orthodox economists fully acknowledge that perfect competition is seldom observed in the real world, and so aim for what is called &quot;workable competition&quot;. This follows the theory that if one cannot achieve the ideal, then go for the second best option by using the law to tame market operation where it can.

===Chicago school===
A group of economists and lawyers, who are largely associated with the University of Chicago, advocate an approach to competition law guided by the proposition that some actions that were originally considered to be anticompetitive could actually promote competition. The U.S. Supreme Court has used the Chicago school approach in several recent cases. One view of the Chicago school approach to antitrust is found in United States Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Richard Posner&#x27;s books &quot;Antitrust Law&quot; and &quot;Economic Analysis of Law&quot;.

Robert Bork was highly critical of court decisions on United States antitrust law in a series of law review articles and his book &quot;The Antitrust Paradox&quot;. Bork argued that both the original intention of antitrust laws and economic efficiency was the pursuit &quot;only&quot; of consumer welfare, the protection of competition rather than competitors. Furthermore, only a few acts should be prohibited, namely cartels that fix prices and divide markets, mergers that create monopolies, and dominant firms pricing predatorily, while allowing such practices as vertical agreements and price discrimination on the grounds that it did not harm consumers. Running through the different critiques of US antitrust policy is the common theme that government interference in the operation of free markets does more harm than good. &quot;The only cure for bad theory,&quot; writes Bork, &quot;is better theory.&quot; Harvard Law School professor Philip Areeda, who favours more aggressive antitrust policy, in at least one Supreme Court case challenged Robert Bork&#x27;s preference for non-intervention.

==Practice==

===Collusion and cartels===

===Dominance and monopoly===
When firms hold large market shares, consumers risk paying higher prices and getting lower quality products than compared to competitive markets. However, the existence of a very high market share does not always mean consumers are paying excessive prices since the threat of new entrants to the market can restrain a high-market-share firm&#x27;s price increases. Competition law does not make merely having a monopoly illegal, but rather abusing the power that a monopoly may confer, for instance through exclusionary practices. Market dominance is connected with decreased innovation and increased political connectedness.

First, it is necessary to determine whether a firm is dominant, or whether it behaves &quot;to an appreciable extent independently of its competitors, customers and ultimately of its consumer&quot;. Under EU law, very large market shares raise a presumption that a firm is dominant, which may be rebuttable. If a firm has a dominant position, then there is &quot;a special responsibility not to allow its conduct to impair competition on the common market&quot;. Similarly as with collusive conduct, market shares are determined with reference to the particular market in which the firm and product in question is sold. Then although the lists are seldom closed, certain categories of abusive conduct are usually prohibited under the country&#x27;s legislation. For instance, limiting production at a shipping port by refusing to raise expenditure and update technology could be abusive. Tying one product into the sale of another can be considered abuse too, being restrictive of consumer choice and depriving competitors of outlets. This was the alleged case in &quot;Microsoft v. Commission&quot; leading to an eventual fine of million for including its Windows Media Player with the Microsoft Windows platform. A refusal to supply a facility which is essential for all businesses attempting to compete to use can constitute an abuse. One example was in a case involving a medical company named &quot;Commercial Solvents&quot;. When it set up its own rival in the tuberculosis drugs market, Commercial Solvents were forced to continue supplying a company named Zoja with the raw materials for the drug. Zoja was the only market competitor, so without the court forcing supply, all competition would have been eliminated.

Forms of abuse relating directly to pricing include price exploitation. It is difficult to prove at what point a dominant firm&#x27;s prices become &quot;exploitative&quot; and this category of abuse is rarely found. In one case however, a French funeral service was found to have demanded exploitative prices, and this was justified on the basis that prices of funeral services outside the region could be compared. A more tricky issue is predatory pricing. This is the practice of dropping prices of a product so much that one&#x27;s smaller competitors cannot cover their costs and fall out of business. The Chicago school considers predatory pricing to be unlikely. However, in &quot;France Telecom SA v. Commission&quot; a broadband internet company was forced to pay $13.9 million for dropping its prices below its own production costs. It had &quot;no interest in applying such prices except that of eliminating competitors&quot; and was being cross-subsidized to capture the lion&#x27;s share of a booming market. One last category of pricing abuse is price discrimination. An example of this could be a company offering rebates to industrial customers who export their sugar, but not to customers who are selling their goods in the same market.

====Example====
According to The World Bank&#x27;s &quot;Republic of Armenia Accumulation, Competition, and Connectivity Global Competition&quot; report which was published in 2013, the Global Competitiveness Index suggests that Armenia ranks lowest among ECA (Europe and Central Asia) countries in the effectiveness of anti-monopoly policy and the intensity of competition. This low ranking somehow explains the low employment and low incomes in Armenia.

===Mergers and acquisitions===
A merger or acquisition involves, from a competition law perspective, the concentration of economic power in the hands of fewer than before. This usually means that one firm buys out the shares of another. The reasons for oversight of economic concentrations by the state are the same as the reasons to restrict firms who abuse a position of dominance, only that regulation of mergers and acquisitions attempts to deal with the problem before it arises, &quot;ex ante&quot; prevention of market dominance. In the United States merger regulation began under the Clayton Act, and in the European Union, under the Merger Regulation 139/2004 (known as the &quot;ECMR&quot;). Competition law requires that firms proposing to merge gain authorization from the relevant government authority. The theory behind mergers is that transaction costs can be reduced compared to operating on an open market through bilateral contracts. Concentrations can increase economies of scale and scope. However often firms take advantage of their increase in market power, their increased market share and decreased number of competitors, which can adversely affect the deal that consumers get. Merger control is about predicting what the market might be like, not knowing and making a judgment. Hence the central provision under EU law asks whether a concentration &quot;would&quot;, if it went ahead, &quot;significantly impede effective competition... in particular as a result of the creation or strengthening off a dominant position...&quot; and the corresponding provision under US antitrust states similarly,

What amounts to a substantial lessening of, or significant impediment to competition is usually answered through empirical study. The market shares of the merging companies can be assessed and added, although this kind of analysis only gives rise to presumptions, not conclusions. The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index is used to calculate the &quot;density&quot; of the market, or what concentration exists. Aside from the maths, it is important to consider the product in question and the rate of technical innovation in the market. A further problem of collective dominance, or oligopoly through &quot;economic links&quot; can arise, whereby the new market becomes more conducive to collusion. It is relevant how transparent a market is, because a more concentrated structure could mean firms can coordinate their behavior more easily, whether firms can deploy deterrents and whether firms are safe from a reaction by their competitors and consumers. The entry of new firms to the market, and any barriers that they might encounter should be considered. If firms are shown to be creating an uncompetitive concentration, in the US they can still argue that they create efficiencies enough to outweigh any detriment, and similar reference to &quot;technical and economic progress&quot; is mentioned in Art. 2 of the ECMR. Another defense might be that a firm which is being taken over is about to fail or go insolvent, and taking it over leaves a no less competitive state than what would happen anyway. Mergers vertically in the market are rarely of concern, although in &quot;AOL/Time Warner&quot; the European Commission required that a joint venture with a competitor Bertelsmann be ceased beforehand. The EU authorities have also focused lately on the effect of conglomerate mergers, where companies acquire a large portfolio of related products, though without necessarily dominant shares in any individual market.

===Intellectual property, innovation and competition===
Competition law has become increasingly intertwined with intellectual property, such as copyright, trademarks, patents, industrial design rights and in some jurisdictions trade secrets. It is believed that promotion of innovation through enforcement of intellectual property rights may promote as well as limit competitiveness. The question rests on whether it is legal to acquire monopoly through accumulation of intellectual property rights. In which case, the judgment needs to decide between giving preference to intellectual property rights or to competitiveness:
* Should antitrust laws accord special treatment to intellectual property.
* Should intellectual rights be revoked or not granted when antitrust laws are violated.

Concerns also arise over anti-competitive effects and consequences due to:
* Intellectual properties that are collaboratively designed with consequence of violating antitrust laws (intentionally or otherwise).
* The further effects on competition when such properties are accepted into industry standards.
* Cross-licensing of intellectual property.
* Bundling of intellectual property rights to long-term business transactions or agreements to extend the market exclusiveness of intellectual property rights beyond their statutory duration.
* Trade secrets, if they remain a secret, having an eternal length of life.

Some scholars suggest that a prize instead of patent would solve the problem of deadweight loss, when innovators got their reward from the prize, provided by the government or non-profit organization, rather than directly selling to the market, see Millennium Prize Problems. However, innovators may accept the prize only when it is at least as much as how much they earn from patent, which is a question difficult to determine.

<text>Tasciovanus (died c. 9 AD) was a historical king of the Catuvellauni tribe before the Roman conquest of Britain.

==History==

Tasciovanus is known only through numismatic evidence. He appears to have become king of the Catuvellauni c. 20 BC, ruling from Verlamion (the site of modern-day St Albans). He is believed to have moved the tribal capital to that site from an earlier settlement, near modern-day Wheathampstead.
 (recent excavations on the southern plateau of the ver valley revealed evidence of occupation, including sherds of mid-first century Roman pottery plus several republican denari minted in Rome between 100 and 80 BC, indicating an established settlement existed from the early first century BC.

For a brief period (c. 15–10 BC) he issued coins from Camulodunum (Colchester), apparently supplanting Addedomarus of the Trinovantes. After this, he once again issued his coins from Verlamion, now bearing the legend RICON, for *&quot;Rigonos&quot;, Common Brittonic for &quot;great/divine/legitimate king&quot;. Some of his coins bear other abbreviated names such as &quot;DIAS&quot;, &quot;SEGO&quot; and &quot;ANDOCO&quot;: these are generally considered to be the names of co-rulers or subordinate kings, but may instead be mint-marks. He died c. AD 9, succeeded by his son Cunobeline, who ruled primarily from Camulodunum. Another son, Epaticcus, expanded his territory westwards into the lands of the Atrebates.

==Medieval traditions==

A genealogy preserved in the medieval Welsh manuscript British Library Harley MS 3859 (see Harleian genealogies) contains three generations which read &quot;Caratauc map Cinbelin map Teuhant&quot;. This is the equivalent of &quot;Caratacus, son of Cunobelinus, son of Tasciovanus&quot;, putting the three historical figures in the correct order, although the wrong historical context, the degree of linguistic change suggesting a long period of oral transmission. The remainder of the genealogy contains the names of a sequence of Roman emperors, and two Welsh mythological figures, Guidgen (Gwydion) and Lou (Lleu).

He appears in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s fictional &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (1136) as the legendary king Tenvantius, son of Lud. When his father died, he and his older brother Androgeus were still minors, so the kingship of Britain was given to their uncle Cassibelanus. Tenvantius was made Duke of Cornwall and participated in his uncle&#x27;s defence of Britain against Julius Caesar. Androgeus went to Rome with Caesar, so when Cassibelanus died, Tenvantius succeeded him as king. He was in turn succeeded by his son Kimbelinus (Cunobeline), who had been brought up at the court of Augustus.

In Middle Welsh versions of Geoffrey&#x27;s &quot;Historia,&quot; his name appears as Teneufan and Trahayant.

Under the name of Tenewan ap Lludd (Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s Tenvantius Welshified), he is claimed as a paternal ancestor in the Mostyn Ms. 117 by the Mathrafal Dynasty (The Lleision Tribal Princes) and therefore subsequently the Kings of Rhwng Gwy Y Hafren (The Iorwerthion Tribal Princes) also.

<text>The black garden ant (&quot;Lasius niger&quot;), also known as the common black ant, is a formicine ant, the type species of the subgenus &quot;Lasius&quot;, which is found across Europe and in some parts of North America, South America, Asia and Australasia. The European species was split into two species; &quot;L. niger&quot;, which are found in open areas; and &quot;L. platythorax&quot;, which is found in forest habitats. It is monogynous, meaning colonies contain a single queen.

&quot;Lasius niger&quot; colonies normally range from 4,000 to 7,000 workers, but can reach 40,000 in rare cases. A &quot;Lasius niger&quot; queen can live for up to 29 years the longest recorded lifespan for any eusocial insect. &quot;Lasius niger&quot; queens in the early stages of founding can have two to three other queens in the nest. They will tolerate each other until the first workers come, then it is most likely they will fight until one queen remains. Under laboratory conditions, workers can live at least 4 years.

&quot;Lasius niger&quot; is host to a number of temporary social parasites of the &quot;Lasius mixtus&quot; group including &quot;Lasius mixtus&quot; and &quot;Lasius umbratus&quot;.

==Appearance==
==Life cycle==
===Mating flights===
Ants mate on the wing, so &quot;flying ants&quot; are alates (reproductive individuals), which include males and gynes (virgin queens). The mating (or nuptial) flights of &quot;Lasius niger&quot; usually occur around June to September throughout the species&#x27; range; in North America flights usually occur during the autumn, whereas in Europe they generally take place during the hot summer months of July and August. Flights can contain thousands of winged males and females.

Disparities between local weather conditions can cause nuptial flights to be out of phase amongst widespread populations of &quot;L. niger&quot;. During long-lasting, hot summers, flights can take place simultaneously across the country, but overcast weather with local patches of sunshine results in a far less synchronized emergence of alates.

Once the queens have mated they will land and discard their wings and begin to find a suitable place to dig a tunnel. Meanwhile, males generally only live for a day or two after the mating flights and will then die.

===New nest===
After removing her wings, a queen will move quickly to find moist ground, then start digging a tunnel. Once the tunnel has been completed, the queen will block the entrance and retreat to the bottom. Subsequently, she will dig out a small chamber. This will serve as the claustral chamber of the new colony. Generally, a queen will begin to lay eggs immediately after the construction of the chamber, and the eggs will develop to imagines in 8–10 weeks. Until the eggs hatch and the larvae grow to maturity, a &quot;Lasius niger&quot; queen will not eat, relying on the protein of her wing muscles to be broken down and digested. In some cases, a &quot;Lasius niger&quot; queen may eat her own eggs in order to survive.

===Egg to ant===

&quot;Lasius niger&quot;, like other ants, have four stages of development: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. &quot;Lasius niger&quot; lay tiny, white, kidney-shaped eggs with a smooth sticky surface which helps them to be carried in a group instead of one by one. After hatching &quot;Lasius niger&quot; proceed onto the larva stage resembling tiny maggots. The larvae need to be fed by the queen (or workers in the case of an established colony) if they are to mature; as they feed the larvae grow, shedding their skin, doing so usually three times in total. With each molt, the larvae grow hooked hairs which allow them to be carried in groups. When &quot;Lasius niger&quot; larvae reach the last molt they are generally too big to be carried as part of a group and so are carried individually. Once the larva grows big enough it spins a cocoon around itself. To aid this process a queen (or workers) may bury the larva so that it can spin its cocoon undisturbed, and begin a process of metamorphosis. Once the process is complete the &quot;Lasius niger&quot; worker emerges from the cocoon. At this stage, the callow worker is completely white but will darken over the course of an hour until it has turned black.

===Colony established===
The first worker ants that emerge are very small compared to later generations. At this point the workers immediately begin to expand the nest and care for the queen and brood; they eventually remove the seal from the entrance to the nest and begin to forage above ground. This is a critical time for the colony as they need to gather food quickly to support future growth and particularly to feed the starved queen, who would have lost around 50% of her body weight. From this point on the queen&#x27;s egg laying output will increase significantly, becoming the queen&#x27;s sole function. The later generations of worker ants will be bigger, stronger and more aggressive because there is more nutrition for them at the larval stage. The initial brood being fed only by the scarce resources available to a queen will be much smaller than brood supported by a team of foraging and nursing workers. Provided workers are able to find food, at this stage the colony will see an exponential rise in population. After several years, once the colony is well established, the queen will lay eggs that will become queens and males. Black ants often make large nests with extensive tunnel connections.

===Quarantine behavior===
When building their colony, the ants structure it so as to inhibit the transmission of different contagions. Different communities within the colony are segregated by a limited number of connective nodes, allowing for greater protection of vulnerable hive members, such as larvae and pupae, and the queen.

Additionally, individual infected ants have been observed as spending more time foraging outside of the hive, venturing farther than other ants, and limiting their interactions once within the hive again.

==Long-lived queens==
Although worker ants live for a couple of months, queens typically survive for almost 15 years but there have been instances of queens living up to 29 years, the longest recorded lifespan for any eusocial insect. Understanding the basis for the greater longevity of queens has a bearing on the general unsolved problem in biology of the causes of aging. In the study of long-lived queen ants it was found that queens have a higher expression than genetically identical workers of genes involved in processing damaged macromolecules. Genes with higher expression included those that are necessary for repair of DNA damage (see DNA damage theory of aging) and genes involved in proteasome-mediated, ubiquitin-dependent, protein catabolic processes.

==Mutualisms==
&quot;Lasius niger&quot; removes predators such as ladybirds from the vicinity of black bean aphid thus keeping their &quot;milch cows&quot; safe. On a test plot of field beans (&quot;Vicia faba&quot;), plants without black bean aphids yielded an average of 56 seeds per plant, those with aphids and no ants yielded 17 seeds, and those with both ants and aphids averaged eight seeds per plant. &quot;Vicia faba&quot; also produces extrafloral nectaries that &quot;Lasius niger&quot; can feed from directly.

The &quot;Plebejus argus&quot; butterfly lays eggs near nests of &quot;L. niger&quot;, forming a mutualistic relationship. This mutualistic relationship benefits the adult butterfly by reducing the need for parental investment. Once the eggs hatch, the ants chaperone the larvae, averting the attacks of predatory organisms like wasps and spiders as well as parasites. In return, the ants receive a saccharine secretion fortified with amino acids from an eversible gland on the larvae&#x27;s back. As first instar larvae prepare to pupate, the ants carry the larvae into their nests. Once the larvae become pupae, the ants continue to provide protection against predation and parasitism. The butterfly leaves the nest when it emerges in June.

==Antkeeping==
Black Garden Ants are widely considered amongst the antkeeping community as one of the easiest species to keep due to low maintenance requirements, quick colony growth, among many other things.

Local Government in the Porirua basin began on 1 June 1854 with the Porirua Road Board being declared in the Wellington Provincial Council Gazette. Road boards were set up by the provincial governments to develop and maintain local and district roads.

The first election for the Porirua Road District, held under the District Highways Act 1856, took place on 20 September 1856. On 7th November 1864, the Takapu Road District was declared and wardens for the district were elected annually. The Wellington Highway District Board (Hutt County) was given control of the district in 1872.

In 1876, Makara and Porirua ridings were made part of the Karori-Makara Highway Board and elections were conducted. Later that year, Porirua was established as one of six ridings making up Hutt County, which in turn was established by the Counties Act 1876 as one of 12 counties which would replace the Wellington Province. It elected 2 councillors to the Hutt County Council.

In 1908, Makara County was separated from Hutt County, amalgamating the Porirua riding with the Makara riding and Tawa. The first elections for Makara County were held on 28 January 1908.

Following the construction of a new business district on the site of the village of Porirua beginning in the 1950s, the autonomous Borough of Porirua was established on 1 September 1962, the day after Makara County was abolished. The rest of what had been the Makara County was re-incorporated into Hutt County as the Makara Riding. Tawa had already separated from the county to form its own Town Board in 1951.

Porirua was declared to be a city in 1965 by Governor-general Sir Bernard Fergusson.

On 1 April 1973, the city of Porirua was expanded to include large areas to the north-east and some to the south, transferred from Hutt County, along with Mana Island. In 1988, it was further expanded to include the Horokiri riding, which contained most of Whitby and large rural areas, before Hutt County was abolished in the 1989 local government reforms, which transferred to Wellington City most of the southern fringe areas that had been added in 1973 - notably the Takapu Valley and Arohata.
==Council and committees==
The elected mayor and councillors provide governance for the city by setting the policy direction of the council, monitoring its performance, representing the city&#x27;s interests, and employing the Chief Executive. 

The Chief Executive is in charge of the administration of the council and employs all other council staff to achieve its strategic priorities. The Chief Executive is currently Wendy Walker.

===Committees===

==Wards==
The 10 councillors are elected from three wards: Onepoto General Ward, Pāuatahanui General Ward, and Parirua Māori Ward.

Candidates standing in the general wards are elected by voters registered on the general electoral roll, while those standing in the Māori ward are elected by voters registered on the Māori electoral roll.

===Parirua Māori Ward===
The Parirua Māori Ward elects 1 councillor and covers the whole city of Porirua.

The Parirua Māori Ward was established following a council vote in May 2021, a representation review and an appeal to the Local Government Commission which upheld its establishment.

===Onepoto General Ward===
The Onepoto General Ward elects 5 councillors and covers:
===Pāuatahanui General Ward===
The Pāuatahanui General Ward elects 4 councillors and covers:
==Coat of arms==
Porirua City was granted a Coat of Arms by the Earl Marshal of England on 1 December 1965. The city officially adopted the coat of arms via a bylaw on 27 November 1969.

<doc id="666268" wikidata="Q15313730" url="?curid=666268" title="Provinces of Zambia">
<text>Zambia is divided into ten provinces. The provinces are further subdivided into districts. The Provincial Administration is headed by a Provincial Minister, who is appointed by the President, and is responsible for overseeing the implementation of government policies and coordinating the activities of various government departments within the province. The Provincial Minister is supported by a Provincial Permanent Secretary, who handles the day-to-day administration. Each province has a Provincial Development Coordinating Committee (PDCC) that plays a key role in development planning and coordinating projects within the province.

The current provinces were established following Zambia&#x27;s independence in 1964, although their borders and functions have evolved over time to support the country’s decentralization efforts.

==List of provinces==
==Administration==
The provincial government in Zambia is primarily established for administrative purposes. Each province is headed by a Provincial Minister appointed by the President, who oversees the implementation of national policies and government programs at the provincial level. The administrative head of each province is the Provincial Permanent Secretary, also appointed by the President, who is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the province. Supporting the Permanent Secretary are the Deputy Permanent Secretary, heads of government departments, and other civil servants at the provincial level.

Provinces are further divided into districts, with 116 districts across the 10 provinces. Each district (except for Mafinga and Kanchibiya) shares its name with its headquarters. Within each district, there is a council headed by an elected representative known as a Councilor. Councilors hold office for five years and play a key role in local governance.

The administrative staff of the council is selected by the Local Government Service Commission, either from within or outside the district. The office of the provincial government is located in each district headquarters and includes provincial local government officers and auditors.

Each council is responsible for raising and collecting local taxes. These funds are crucial for the council&#x27;s operations, which include maintaining infrastructure and delivering services. The council&#x27;s budget is audited annually and submitted to the central government for review. Councilors do not receive salaries but are compensated with allowances funded by the council.

Zambia’s provinces are predominantly rural, with only five city councils, namely Lusaka, Ndola, Kitwe, Livingstone and Chipata. The Zambian government has outlined 63 different functions for the councils, focusing mainly on infrastructure management and local administration. These functions include maintaining community centers, parks, drainage systems, playgrounds, cemeteries, libraries, museums, and art galleries.

In addition to these responsibilities, councils collaborate with specific government departments to support agriculture, natural resource conservation, postal services, and the establishment and maintenance of hospitals, schools, and colleges. The councils also prepare schemes to encourage community participation and development at the local level.

==Primary data==
Western Province is the largest in terms of area, having 126,386 km2, while Lusaka was the smallest with 21,896 km2. In terms of population, Lusaka is the most populated and most densely populated with a population of 2,191,225 and densf 100 persons per km2. As of 2010, Western Province had the best sex ratio of 108 females for every 100 males, while Copperbelt had the lowest of 101. Northern had the highest number of basic schools, while Copperbelt had the highest number of high schools. The unemployment rate of youth (55%) and general unemployment rate (32%) was the highest in Copperbelt province, while Eastern had the lowest unemployment rate of 6 per cent. AIDS death was maximum in Copperbelt with 26,799 recorded deaths in 2010, while it was lowest in North-Western with 2,859 recorded deaths. Lusaka Province had the most doctors and fewest malaria related incidents, while North-Western has the lowest number of doctors.

==Economy==
Agriculture is the major profession in most of the provinces in Zambia. Maize, mixed beans, rice, sorghum, soya beans, sunflower, sweet potatoes and wheat are the major crops in the provinces. Among all provinces, Central had the maximum area, , constituting 20.64 per cent of the total, while Luapula had the smallest area at 3.06 per cent. Maize production was maximum in Eastern (22.5%), mixed beans (51.66%) in Northern, sorghum in Southern (40.62%), sunflower in Eastern (70.2%), soya beans (45.06%), sweet potatoes (28.5%) and wheat (49.51%) in Central Province.

<doc id="666269" wikidata="Q1550762" url="?curid=666269" title="Debt of developing countries">
<text>The debt of developing countries usually refers to the external debt incurred by governments of developing countries.

There have been several historical episodes of governments of developing countries borrowing in quantities beyond their ability to repay. &quot;Unpayable debt&quot; is external debt with interest that exceeds what the country&#x27;s politicians think they can collect from taxpayers, based on the nation&#x27;s gross domestic product, thus preventing it from ever being repaid. The debt can result from many causes.

Some of the high levels of debt were amassed following the 1973 oil crisis. Increases in oil prices forced many poorer nations&#x27; governments to borrow heavily to purchase politically essential supplies. At the same time, OPEC funds deposited and &quot;recycled&quot; through western banks provided a ready source of funds for loans. While a portion of borrowed funds went towards infrastructure and economic development financed by central governments, a portion was lost to corruption and about one-fifth was spent on arms.

==Debt abolition==
There is much debate about whether the richer countries should be asked for money which has to be repaid. The Jubilee Debt Campaign gives six reasons why the third world debts should be cancelled. Firstly, several governments want to spend more money on poverty reduction but they lose that money in paying off their debts. Economist Jeff Rubin agrees with this stance on the basis that the money could have been used for basic human needs and says it is odious debt. Secondly, the lenders knew that they gave to dictators or oppressive regimes and thus, they are responsible for their actions, not the people living in the countries of those regimes. For example, South Africa has been paying off $22 billion which was lent to stimulate the apartheid regime. They have yet to recover from this, their external debt has increased to $136.6 billion while the number of people in the housing backlog has increased to 2.1 million from 1994&#x27;s 1.5 million. Also, many lenders knew that a great proportion of the money would sometime be stolen through corruption. Next, the developing projects that some loans would support were often unwisely led and failed because of the lender&#x27;s incompetence. Also, many of the debts were signed with unfair terms, several of the loan takers have to pay the debts in foreign currency such as dollars, which make them vulnerable to world market changes. The unfair terms can make a loan extremely expensive, many of the loan takers have already paid the sum they loaned several times, but the debt grows faster than they can repay it. Finally, many of the loans were contracted illegally, not following proper processes.

A seventh reason for canceling out some debts is that the money loaned by banks is generally created out of thin air, sometimes subject to a small capital adequacy requirement imposed by such institutions as the Bank of International Settlements. Maurice Félix Charles Allais, 1988 winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, commented on this by stating: &quot;The &#x27;miracles&#x27; performed by credit are fundamentally comparable to the &#x27;miracles&#x27; an association of counterfeiters could perform for its benefit by lending its forged banknotes in return for interest. In both cases, the stimulus to the economy would be the same, and the only difference is who benefits.&quot;

===Consequences of debt abolition===
Some people argue against forgiving debt on the basis that it would motivate countries to default on their debts, or to deliberately borrow more than they can afford, and that it would not prevent a recurrence of the problem. Economists refer to this as a moral hazard. It would also be difficult to determine which debt is odious. Moreover, investors could stop lending to developing countries entirely.

==Debt as a mechanism in economic crisis==
An example of debt playing a role in economic crisis was the 1998–2002 Argentine great depression. During the 1980s, Argentina, like many Latin American economies, experienced hyperinflation. As a part of the process put in place to bring inflation under control, a fixed exchange rate was put into place between Argentina&#x27;s new currency and the US dollar. This guaranteed that inflation would not restart, since for every new unit of currency issued by the Argentine Central Bank, the Central Bank had to hold a US dollar against this – therefore in order to print more Argentine currency, the government required additional US dollars. Before this currency regime was in place, if the government had needed money to finance a budget deficit, it could simply print more money (thus creating inflation). Under the new system, if the government spent more than it earned through taxation in a given year, it needed to cover the gap with US dollars, rather than by simply printing more money. The only way the government could get these US dollars to finance the gap was through higher tax of exporters&#x27; earnings or through borrowing the needed US dollars. A fixed exchange rate was incompatible with a structural (i.e., recurrent) budget deficit, as the government needed to borrow more US Dollars every year to finance its budget deficit, eventually leading to an unsustainable amount of US dollar debt.

Argentina&#x27;s debt grew continuously during the 1990s, increasing to above US$120 billion. As a structural budget deficit continued, the government kept borrowing more, creditors continued to lend money, while the IMF suggested less state spending to stop the government&#x27;s ongoing need to keep borrowing more and more. As the debt pile grew, it became increasingly clear the government&#x27;s structural budget deficit was not compatible with a low inflation fixed exchange rate – either the government had to start earning as much as it spent, or it had to start (inflationary) printing of money (and thus abandoning the fixed exchange rate as it would not be able to borrow the needed amounts of US dollars to keep the exchange rate stable). Investors started to speculate that the government would never stop spending more than it earned, and so there was only one option for the government – inflation and the abandonment of the fixed exchange rate. In a similar fashion to Black Wednesday, investors began to sell the Argentine currency, betting it would become worthless against the US dollar when the inevitable inflation started. This became a self-fulfilling prophecy, quickly leading to the government&#x27;s US dollar reserves being exhausted. The crisis led to riots in December 2001. In 2002, a default on about $93 billion of the debt was declared. Investment fled the country, and capital flow towards Argentina ceased almost completely.

The Argentine government met severe challenges trying to refinance the debt. Some creditors denounced the default as sheer robbery. Vulture funds who had acquired debt bonds during the crisis, at very low prices, asked to be repaid immediately. For four years, Argentina was effectively shut out of the international financial markets.

Argentina finally got a deal by which 77% of the defaulted bonds were exchanged by others, of a much lower nominal value and at longer terms. The exchange was not accepted by the rest of the private debt holders, who continue to challenge the government to repay them a greater percentage of the money which they originally loaned. The holdouts have formed groups such as American Task Force Argentina to lobby the Argentine government, in addition to seeking redress by attempting to seize Argentine foreign reserves.

In 2016, Argentina cancelled its debt with the holdout creditors, which received returns in the order of the hundreds of percentage points.

===The determinants of external debt crises in developing countries===
Some of the major risk factors which increase the probability of the external debt crises in developing countries include high level of inflation, relatively large share of short term debt in external debt, denomination of the debt in foreign currency, decrease of the terms of trade over time, unsustainable total debt service relative to GNI, high income inequality, and high share of agriculture in GDP. At the same time, holding foreign exchange reserves is a strong protective measure against an external debt crisis.

==Recent debt relief==
37 impoverished countries have recently received partial or full cancellation of loans from foreign governments and international financial institutions, such as the IMF and World Bank under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, see table below. A further two countries, Eritrea and Sudan, are in the process towards full debt relief; Zimbabwe has unsustainable debt but has not made the reforms necessary to participate in the program.

Under the Jubilee 2000 banner, a coalition of groups joined together to demand debt cancellation at the G7 meeting in Cologne, Germany. As a result, finance ministers of the world&#x27;s wealthiest nations agreed to debt relief on loans owed by qualifying countries.

A 2004 World Bank/IMF study found that in countries receiving debt relief, poverty reduction initiatives doubled between 1999 and 2004. Tanzania used savings to eliminate school fees, hire more teachers, and build more schools. Burkina Faso drastically reduced the cost of life-saving drugs and increased access to clean water. Uganda more than doubled school enrollment.

In 2005, the Make Poverty History campaign, mounted in the run-up to the G8 Summit in Scotland, brought the issue of debt once again to the attention of the media and world leaders. Some have claimed that it was the Live 8 concerts which were instrumental in raising the profile of the debt issue at the G8, but these were announced after the Summit pre-negotiations had essentially agreed the terms of the debt announcement made at the Summit, and so can only have been of marginal utility. Make Poverty History, in contrast, had been running for five months prior to the Live 8 announcement and, in form of the Jubilee 2000 campaign (of which Make Poverty History was essentially a re-branding) for ten years. Debt cancellation for the 18 countries qualifying under this new initiative has also brought impressive results on paper. For example, it has been reported that Zambia used savings to significantly increase its investment in health, education, and rural infrastructure. The fungibility of savings from debt service makes such claims difficult to establish. Under the terms of the G8 debt proposal, the funding sources available to Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) are also curtailed; some researchers have argued that the net financial benefit of the G8 proposals is negligible, even though on paper the debt burden seems temporarily alleviated.

The 2005 HIPC agreement did not wipe all debt from HIPC countries, as is stated in the article. The total debt has been reduced by two-thirds, so that their debt service obligations fall to less than 2 million in one year.
While celebrating the successes of these individual countries, debt campaigners continue to advocate for the extension of the benefits of debt cancellation to all countries that require cancellation to meet basic human needs and as a matter of justice.

To assist in the reinvestment of released capital, most international financial institutions provide guidelines indicating probable shocks, programs to reduce a country&#x27;s vulnerability through export diversification, food buffer stocks, enhanced climate prediction methods, more flexible and reliable aid disbursement mechanisms by donors, and much higher and more rapid contingency financing. Sometimes outside experts are brought to control the country&#x27;s financial institutions.

=== List of heavily indebted poor countries ===
===2004 Indian Ocean earthquake===
When the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami hit, the G7 announced a moratorium on debts of twelve affected nations and the Paris Club suspended loan payments of three more. By the time the Paris Club met in January 2005, its 19 member-countries had pledged $3.4 billion in aid to the countries affected by the tsunami.

The debt relief for tsunami-affected nations was not universal. Sri Lanka was left with a debt of more than $8 billion and an annual debt service bill of $493 million. Indonesia retained a foreign debt of more than $132 billion and debt service payments to the World Bank amounted to $1.9 billion in 2006. In 2015 the total debt of Sri Lanka is $55 billion. Some of this is due to borrowing to help with infrastructure and some of it is due to corruption. The last time they sought help from the IMF was 2009, they received a $2.6 billion loan. They have yet to recover from the tsunami.

===G8 Summit 2005: aid to Africa and debt cancellation===
The traditional meeting of G8 finance ministers before the summit took place in London on 10 and 11 June 2005, hosted by then-Chancellor Gordon Brown. On 11 June, agreement was reached to write off the entire US$40 billion debt owed by 18 Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) to the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the African Development Fund. The annual saving in debt payments amounts to just over US$1 billion. War on Want estimates that US$45.7 billion would be required for 62 countries to meet the Millennium Development Goals. The ministers stated that twenty more countries, with an additional US$15 billion in debt, would be eligible for debt relief if they met targets on fighting corruption and continue to fulfill structural adjustment conditionalities that eliminate impediments to investment and calls for countries to privatize industries, liberalize their economies, eliminate subsidies, and reduce budgetary expenditures. The agreement came into force in July 2006 and has been called the &quot;Multilateral Debt Reduction Initiative&quot;, MDRI. It can be thought of as an extension of the HIPC initiative. This decision was heavily influenced and applauded by international development organizations like Jubilee 2000 and the ONE Campaign.

Opponents of debt cancellation suggested that structural adjustment policies should be continued. Structural adjustments had been criticized for years for devastating poor countries. For example, in Zambia, structural adjustment reforms of the 1980s and early 1990s included massive cuts to health and education budgets, the introduction of user fees for many basic health services and for primary education, and the cutting of crucial programs such as child immunization initiatives.

====Criticism of G8 debt exceptions====
Countries that qualify for the HIPC process will only have debts to the World Bank, IMF and African Development Bank canceled. Criticism was raised over the exceptions to this agreement as Asian countries will still have to repay debt to the Asian Development Bank and Latin American countries will still have to repay debt to the Inter-American Development Bank. Between 2006 and 2010 this amounts to US$1.4 billion for the qualifying Latin American countries of Bolivia, Guyana, Honduras and Nicaragua.

<text>A Christian mission is an organized effort to carry on evangelism, in the name of the Christian faith. Missions involve sending individuals and groups across boundaries, most commonly geographical boundaries. Sometimes individuals are sent and are called missionaries, and historically may have been based in mission stations. When groups are sent, they are often called mission teams and they undertake mission trips. There are a few different kinds of mission trips: short-term, long-term, relational and those that simply help people in need. Some people choose to dedicate their whole lives to mission.

Missionaries preach the Christian faith and sometimes administer the sacraments, and provide humanitarian aid or services. Christian doctrines (such as the &quot;Doctrine of Love&quot; professed by many missions) permit the provision of aid without requiring religious conversion. Nonetheless, the provision of help has always been closely tied to evangelization efforts.

==History of Christian missions==

The earliest Christian mission, the Great Commission and Dispersion of the Apostles, was active within Second Temple Judaism. Whether a Jewish proselytism existed or not that would have served as a model for the early Christians is unclear; see Circumcision controversy in early Christianity#Background for details. Soon, the expansion of the Christian mission beyond Judaism to those who were not Jewish became a contested issue, notably at the Council of Jerusalem. The Apostle Paul was an early proponent of this expansion, and contextualized the Christian message for the Greek and Roman cultures, allowing it to reach beyond its Hebrew and Jewish roots.

From Late Antiquity onward, much missionary activity was carried out by members of religious orders. Monasteries followed disciplines and supported missions, libraries, and practical research, all of which were perceived as works to reduce human misery and suffering and glorify the Christian God. For example, Nestorian communities evangelized parts of Central Asia, as well as Tibet, China, and India. Cistercians evangelized much of Northern Europe, as well as developing most of European agriculture&#x27;s classic techniques. St Patrick evangelized many in Ireland. St David was active in Wales.

During the Middle Ages, Ramon Llull advanced the concept of preaching to Muslims and converting them to Christianity by means of non-violent argument. A vision for large-scale mission to Muslims would die with him, not to be revived until the 19th century.

===Medieval===

During the Middle Ages, Christian monasteries and missionaries such as Saint Patrick, and Adalbert of Prague propagated learning and religion beyond the boundaries of the old Roman Empire. In the seventh century Gregory the Great sent missionaries, including Augustine of Canterbury, into England, and in the eight century English Christians, notably Saint Boniface, spread Christianity into Germany. The Hiberno-Scottish mission began in 563.

In the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, Franciscans such as William of Rubruck, John of Montecorvino, and Giovanni ed&#x27; Magnolia were sent as missionaries to the Near and Far East. Their travels took them as far as China in an attempt to convert the advancing Mongols, especially the Great Khans of the Mongol Empire (related to Medieval Roman Catholic Missions in China). In the later part of the fifteenth century, Portuguese missionaries had success in spreading Christianity to the Kingdom of Kongo in West Africa. In 1491, King João I of Kongo converted to Christianity and his nobility and peasants followed suit. The Kongo kingdom remained Christian for the next two centuries.

===Catholic missions after 1492===
One of the main goals of the Christopher Columbus expedition financed by Queen Isabella of Spain was to spread Christianity. During the Age of Discovery, Spain and Portugal established many missions in their American and Asian colonies. The most active orders were the Jesuits, Augustinians, Franciscans and Dominicans. The Portuguese sent missions into Africa. These are some of the most well-known missions in history. While some of these missions were associated with imperialism and oppression, others (notably Matteo Ricci&#x27;s Jesuit mission to China) were relatively peaceful and focused on inculturation rather than cultural imperialism.

In both Portugal and Spain, religion was an integral part of the state and evangelization was seen as having both secular and spiritual benefits. Wherever these powers attempted to expand their territories or influence, missionaries would soon follow. By the Treaty of Tordesillas, the two powers divided the world between them into exclusive spheres of influence, trade and colonization. The proselytization of Asia became linked to Portuguese colonial policy.

From 1499 onward, Portuguese trade with Asia rapidly proved profitable. As Jesuits arrived in India around 1540 the colonial government in Goa supported the mission with incentives for baptized Christians. Beginning in 1552, the Church sent Jesuits to China and to other countries in Asia.

During the time of the Holland (Batavia) Mission (1592–1853), when the Roman Catholic church in the country was suppressed, there were neither parishes nor dioceses, and the country effectively became a mission area in which congregations were called &quot;stations&quot; (&quot;staties&quot;). &quot;Statie&quot;, usually called a clandestine church in English, refers to both the congregation&#x27;s church and its seat or location.

===Protestant missions===

The Reformation unfolded in Europe in the early 16th century. For over a hundred years, occupied by their struggle with the Catholic Church, the early Protestant churches as a body were not strongly focused on missions to &quot;heathen&quot; lands. Instead, the focus was initially more on Christian lands in the hope to spread the Protestant faith, identifying the papacy with the Antichrist.

In the centuries that followed, Protestant churches began sending out missionaries in increasing numbers, spreading the proclamation of the Christian message to previously unreached people. In North America, missionaries to the Native Americans included Jonathan Edwards (1703–1758), the well-known preacher of the Great Awakening (c. 1731–1755), who in his later years retired from the very public life of his early career. He became a missionary to the Housatonic Native Americans (1751) and a staunch advocate for them against cultural imperialism.

As European culture has been established in the midst of indigenous peoples, the cultural distance between Christians of differing cultures has been difficult to overcome. One early solution was the creation of segregated &quot;praying towns&quot; of Christian natives. This pattern of grudging acceptance of converts played out again later in Hawaii when Congregational missionaries from New England went there and converted the native population, including the royalty. In the course of the Spanish colonization of the Americas, the Catholic missionaries learned the languages of the Amerindians and devised writing systems for them. Then they preached to indigenous people in those languages (Quechua, Guarani, Nahuatl) instead of Spanish, to keep Indians away from &quot;sinful&quot; whites. An extreme case of segregation occurred in the Guarani Reductions, a theocratic semi-independent region established by the Jesuits in the region of the future Paraguay between the early 17th century and 1767.

From 1732 onwards the Moravian Church began sending out missionaries.

In the United States, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) was chartered in 1812.

Protestant missionaries from the Anglican, Lutheran and Presbyterian traditions starting arriving in what was then the Ottoman Empire in the first half of the 19th Century. This eventually let to the creation of what are today the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Jordan and the Holy Land and the see of the Anglican Bishop in Jerusalem. Furthermore, it was during this time that the Christian and Missionary Alliance started their missionary activity in Jerusalem.

====Methodist missions====
Thomas Coke (1747–1814), the first bishop of the American Methodists, was &quot;the Father of Methodist Missions&quot;. After spending time in the newly formed United States of America strengthening the infant Methodist Church alongside Episcopal colleague Francis Asbury, the British-born Coke left for mission work. During his time in America, Coke worked vigorously to increase Methodist support of Christian missions and of raising up mission workers. Coke died while on a mission trip to India, but his legacy among Methodists – his passion for missions – continues.

====Baptist missions====
Missionary organizations favored the development of the Baptist movement on all continents. In England, there was the founding of the Baptist Missionary Society in 1792 at Kettering, England.

William Carey write a pamphlet in 1792, &quot;An Enquiry into the Obligation of Christians to use Means for the Conversion of Heathen&quot; and was the first missionary of the Baptist Missionary Society. He went to Calcutta (Kolkata) in 1793. Far from a dry book of theology, Carey&#x27;s work used the best available geographic and ethnographic data to map and count the number of people who had never heard the Gospel. He has been referred to as the &quot;father of modern missions&quot;, and as &quot;India&#x27;s first cultural anthropologist&quot;.

In the United States, &quot;Hard Shell Baptists&quot;, &quot;Anti-Mission Baptists&quot;, or &quot;Old School Baptists&quot; adhering to strict Calvinism rejected all mission boards, Bible tract societies, and temperance societies as nonbiblical. This faction was strongest in the American South. The mainstream of the Baptist denomination, however, supported missionary work, by the founding of International Ministries in 1814 and International Mission Board in 1845.

===China===
A wave of missions, starting in the early 1850s, targeted inland areas, led by a Briton Hudson Taylor (1832–1905) with his China Inland Mission (1865– ). Taylor was later supported by Henry Grattan Guinness (1835–1910) who founded (1883) Cliff College, which continues to train and equip for local and global mission.

The missions inspired by Taylor and Guinness have collectively been called &quot;faith missions&quot; and owe much to the ideas and example of Anthony Norris Groves (1795–1853). Taylor, a thorough-going nativist, offended the missionaries of his era by wearing Chinese clothing and speaking Chinese at home. His books, speaking, and examples led to the formation of numerous inland missions and of the Student Volunteer Movement (SVM, founded in 1886), which from 1850 to about 1950 sent nearly 10,000 missionaries to inland areas, often at great personal sacrifice. Many early SVM missionaries traveling to areas with endemic tropical diseases left with their belongings packed in a coffin, aware that 80% of them would die within two years.

Missionary activity in China was undertaken by the Protestant churches, as well as the French Catholic Church. According to John K. Fairbank:The opening of the country in the 1860s facilitated the great effort to Christianize China. Building on old foundations, the Roman Catholic establishment totaled by 1894 some 750 European missionaries, 400 native priests, and over half a million communicants. By 1894 the newer Protestant mission effort supported over 1300 missionaries, mainly British and American, and maintained some 500 stations-each with a church, residences, street chapels, and usually a small school and possibly a hospital or dispensary-in about 350 different cities and towns. Yet they had made fewer than 60,000 Chinese Christian converts.

There was limited success in terms of converts and establishing schools in a nation of about 400 million people, but there was escalating anger at the threat of cultural imperialism. The main result was the Boxer Rebellion (1899-1901), in which missions were attacked and thousands of Chinese Christians were massacred in order to destroy Western influences. Some Europeans were killed and many others threatened, Britain joined the other powers in a military invasion that suppressed the Boxers.

===British Empire===

In the 18th century, and even more so in the 19th century, missionaries based in Britain saw the British Empire as a fertile field for proselytizing for Christianity. All the main denominations were involved, including the Church of England, Scottish Presbyterian, and Nonconformists. Much of the enthusiasm emerged from the Evangelical revival. Within the Church of England, the Church Mission Society (CMS) originated in 1799 and went on to undertake activity all around the world, including in what became known as &quot;the Middle East&quot;.

Before the American Revolution, British Anglican and Methodist missionaries were active in the Thirteen Colonies. The Methodists, led by George Whitefield, were the most successful and after the Revolution an entirely distinct American Methodist denomination emerged that became the largest Protestant denomination in the United States. A major problem for British colonial officials was the demand of the Church of England to set up an American bishop; this was strongly opposed by most of the Americans colonists, as it had never happened before. Colonial officials increasingly took a neutral position on religious matters, even in those colonies such as Virginia where the Church of England was officially established, but in practice controlled by laymen in the local vestries. After the American War of Independence, colonial officials decided to enhance the power and wealth of the Church of England in all British colonies, including British North America.

Missionary societies funded their own operations that were not supervised or directed by the Colonial Office. Tensions emerged between the missionaries and the colonial officials. The latter feared that missionaries might stir up trouble or encourage the natives to challenge colonial authority. In general, colonial officials were much more comfortable with working with the established local leadership, including the native religions, rather than introducing the divisive force of Christianity. This proved especially troublesome in India, were very few local elites were attracted to Christianity. In Africa, especially, the missionaries made many converts. As of the 21st century there were more Anglicans in Nigeria than in England.

Christian missions in Australia played a part in both indoctrinating Aboriginal Australians into Christianity, and in controlling their movements and removing children from families, leading to the Stolen Generations. German missionaries ran Lutheran and other mission stations and schools, from the earliest days of colonisation of Australia. One of the largest organisations was the United Aborigines Mission, which ran dozens of missionaries and stations in Western Australia, New South Wales and South Australia in the 1900s.

Missionaries increasingly came to focus on education, medical help, and long-term modernization of the native personality to inculcate European middle-class values. They established schools and medical clinics. Christian missionaries played a public role, especially in promoting sanitation and public health. Many were trained as physicians, or took special courses in public health and tropical medicine at Livingstone College, London.

===After 1870===
By the 1870s, Protestant missions around the world generally acknowledged the long-term material goal was the formation of independent, self-governing, self-supporting, self-propagating churches. The rise of nationalism in the Third World provoked challenges from critics who complained that the missionaries were teaching Western ways, and ignoring the indigenous culture. The Boxer Rebellion in China in 1899–1901 involved bloody attacks on Christian missions and especially their converts. The First World War diverted resources, and pulled most Germans out of missionary work when that country lost its empire. The worldwide Great Depression of the 1930s was a major blow to funding mission activities.

In 1910, the Edinburgh Missionary Conference was presided over by active SVM and YMCA leader John R. Mott, an American Methodist layperson, the conference reviewed the state of evangelism, Bible translation, mobilization of church support, and the training of indigenous leadership. Looking to the future, conferees worked on strategies for worldwide evangelism and cooperation. The conference not only established greater ecumenical cooperation in missions, but also essentially launched the modern ecumenical movement.

The next wave of missions was started by two missionaries, Cameron Townsend and Donald McGavran, around 1935. These men realized that although earlier missionaries had reached geographic areas, there were numerous ethnographic groups that were isolated by language, or class from the groups that missionaries had reached. Cameron formed Wycliffe Bible Translators to translate the Bible into native languages. McGavran concentrated on finding bridges to cross the class and cultural barriers in places like India, which has upwards of 4,600 peoples, separated by a combination of language, culture, and caste. Despite democratic reforms, caste and class differences are still fundamental in many cultures.

An equally important dimension of missions strategy is the indigenous method of nationals reaching their own people. In Asia this wave of missions was pioneered by men like Dr G. D. James of Singapore, Rev Theodore Williams of India and Dr David Cho of Korea. The &quot;two thirds missions movement&quot; as it is referred to, is today a major force in missions.

Often, missionaries provide welfare and health services, as a good deed or to make friends with the locals. Thousands of schools, orphanages, and hospitals have been established by missions. One service provided by missionaries was the &quot;Each one, teach one&quot; literacy program begun by Dr. Frank Laubach in the Philippines in 1935. The program has since spread around the world and brought literacy to the least enabled members of many societies.

During this period missionaries, especially evangelical and Pentecostal missionaries, witnessed a substantial increase in the number of conversions of Muslims to Christianity. In an interview published in 2013 a leader of a key missionary agency focused on Muslims claimed that the world is living in a &quot;day of salvation for Muslims everywhere&quot;.

Theologically conservative evangelical, Pentecostal, Adventist and Mormon missionaries typically avoid cultural imperialism, and focus on spreading the gospel and translating the Bible. In the process of translating local languages, missionaries have often been vital in preserving and documenting the culture of the peoples among whom they live.

The word &quot;mission&quot; was historically often applied to the building, the &quot;mission station&quot; in which the missionary lives or works. In some colonies, these mission stations became a focus of settlement of displaced or formerly nomadic people. Particularly in rural Australia, mission stations (known as missions) became home to many Indigenous Australians.

==Contemporary concepts of mission==
===Sending and receiving nations===
Major nations not only send and fund missionaries abroad, but also receive them from other countries. In 2010, the United States sent out 127,000 missionaries, while 32,400 came to the United States. Brazil was second, sending out 34,000, and receiving 20,000. France sent out 21,000 and received 10,000. Britain sent out 15,000 and received 10,000. India sent out 10,000 and received 8000. Other major exporters included Spain at 21,000 sent out, Italy at 20,000, South Korea at 20,000, Germany at 14,000, and Canada at 8,500. Large recipient nations included Russia, receiving 20,000; Congo receiving 15,000; South Africa, 12,000; Argentina, 10,000; and Chile, 8,500. The largest sending agency in the United States is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints who, at this date 2019, has 67,000 full time proselytizing young missionaries all over the world with many more elder missionaries serving in similar circumstances. The Southern Baptist Convention, has 4,800 missionaries, plus 450 support staff working inside the United States. The annual budget is about $50,000 per year per missionary. In recent years, however, the Southern Baptist foreign missionary operation (the International Mission Board) has operated at a deficit, and it is cutting operations by 15 percent. It is encouraging older missionaries to retire and return to the United States.

===Modern missionary methods and doctrines among conservative Protestants===
The Lausanne Congress of 1974, birthed a movement that supports evangelical mission among non-Christians and nominal Christians. It regards &quot;mission&quot; as that which is designed &quot;to form a viable indigenous church-planting and world changing movement.&quot; This definition is motivated by a theologically imperative theme of the Bible to make God known, as outlined in the Great Commission. The definition is claimed to summarize the acts of Jesus&#x27; ministry, which is taken as a model motivation for all ministries.

This Christian missionary movement seeks to implement churches after the pattern of the first century Apostles. The process of forming disciples is necessarily social. &quot;Church&quot; should be understood in the widest sense, as a body of believers of Christ rather than simply a building. In this view, even those who are already culturally Christian must be &quot;evangelized&quot;.

Church planting by cross-cultural missionaries leads to the establishment of self-governing, self-supporting and self-propagating communities of believers. This is the famous &quot;three-self&quot; formula formulated by Henry Venn of the London Church Missionary Society in the 19th century. Cross-cultural missionaries are persons who accept church-planting duties to evangelize people outside their culture, as Christ commanded in the Great Commission (, ).

The objective of these missionaries is to give an understandable presentation of their beliefs with the hope that people will choose to following the teaching of Jesus Christ and live their lives as His disciples. As a matter of strategy, many evangelical Christians around the world now focus on what they call the &quot;10/40 window&quot;, a band of countries between 10 and 40 degrees north latitude and reaching from western Africa through Asia. Christian missions strategist Luis Bush pinpointed the need for a major focus of evangelism in the &quot;10/40 Window&quot;, a phrase he coined in his presentation at the missionary conference Lausanne 1989 in Manila. Sometimes referred to as the &quot;Resistant Belt&quot;, it is an area that includes 35% of the world&#x27;s land mass, 90% of the world&#x27;s poorest peoples and 95% of those who have yet to hear anything about Christianity.

Modern mission techniques are sufficiently refined that within ten to fifteen years, most indigenous churches are locally pastored, managed, taught, self-supporting and evangelizing. The process can be substantially faster if a preexisting translation of the Bible and higher pastoral education are already available, perhaps left over from earlier, less effective missions.

One strategy is to let indigenous cultural groups decide to adopt Christian doctrines and benefits, when (as in most cultures) such major decisions are normally made by groups. In this way, opinion leaders in the groups can persuade much or most of the groups to convert. When combined with training in discipleship, church planting and other modern missionary doctrine, the result is an accelerating, self-propelled conversion of large portions of the culture.

A typical modern mission is a co-operative effort by many different ministries, often including several coordinating ministries, such as the Faith2Share network, often with separate funding sources. One typical effort proceeded as follows:

# A missionary radio group recruits, trains and broadcasts in the main dialect of the target culture&#x27;s language. Broadcast content is carefully adapted to avoid syncretism yet help the Christian Gospel seem like a native, normal part of the target culture. Broadcast content often includes news, music, entertainment and education in the language, as well as purely Christian items.
# Broadcasts might advertise programs, inexpensive radios (possibly spring-wound), and a literature ministry that sells a Christian mail-order correspondence course at nominal costs. The literature ministry is key, and is normally a separate organization from the radio ministry. Modern literature missions are shifting to web-based content where it makes sense (as in Western Europe and Japan).
# When a person or group completes a correspondence course, they are invited to contact a church-planting missionary group from (if possible) a related cultural group. The church-planting ministry is usually a different ministry from either the literature or radio ministries. The church-planting ministry usually requires its missionaries to be fluent in the target language, and trained in modern church-planting techniques.
# The missionary then leads the group to start a church. Churches planted by these groups are usually a group that meets in a house. The object is the minimum organization that can perform the required character development and spiritual growth. Buildings, complex ministries and other expensive items are mentioned, but deprecated until the group naturally achieves the size and budget to afford them. The crucial training is how to become a Christian (by faith in Jesus Christ) and then how to set up a church (meet to study the Bible, and perform communion and worship), usually in that order.
# A new generation of churches is created, and the growth begins to accelerate geometrically. Frequently, daughter churches are created only a few months after a church&#x27;s creation. In the fastest-growing Christian movements, the pastoral education is &quot;pipelined&quot;, flowing in a just-in-time fashion from the central churches to daughter churches. That is, planting of churches does not wait for the complete training of pastors.

The most crucial part of church planting is selection and training of leadership. Classically, leadership training required an expensive stay at a seminary, a Bible college. Modern church planters deprecate this because it substantially slows the growth of the church without much immediate benefit. Modern mission doctrines replace the seminary with programmed curricula or (even less expensive) books of discussion questions, and access to real theological books. The materials are usually made available in a major trading language in which most native leaders are likely to be fluent. In some cases, the materials can be adapted for oral use.

It turns out that new pastors&#x27; practical needs for theology are well addressed by a combination of practical procedures for church planting, discussion in small groups, and motivated Bible-based study from diverse theological texts. As a culture&#x27;s church&#x27;s wealth increases, it will naturally form classic seminaries on its own.

Another related mission is Bible translation. The above-mentioned literature has to be translated. Missionaries actively experiment with advanced linguistic techniques to speed translation and literacy. Bible translation not only speeds a church&#x27;s growth by aiding self-training, but it also assures that Christian information becomes a permanent part of the native culture and literature. Some ministries also use modern recording techniques to reach groups with audio that could not be soon reached with literature.

===Among Roman Catholics===
For Catholics, &quot;Missions&quot; is the term given to those particular undertakings by which the heralds of the Gospel, sent out by the Church and going forth into the whole world, carry out the task of preaching the Gospel and planting the Church among peoples or groups who do not yet believe in Christ.

Vatican II made a deep impact on Catholic missions around the world. The Church&#x27;s relations to non-Christian religions like Judaism and Islam were revisited.

A steep decline in the number of people entering the priesthood and religious life in the West has made the Church look towards laity more and more. Communities like Opus Dei arose to meet this need.

Inculturation increasingly became a key topic of missiological reflection for Catholics. Inculturation is understood as the meeting of the Christian message with a community in their cultural context.

Liberation Theology and liturgical reform have also been important in forming and influencing the mission of the Catholic Church in the 20th and 21st Centuries.

In relation to mission, Pope Benedict XVI made the re-evangelization of Europe and North America a priority in his own ministry, even while the upper leadership of the Roman Catholic hierarchy and the college of cardinals has more members from Latin America, Africa, and Asia than ever before.

Key documents on mission for Catholics during this period are &quot;Evangelii nuntiandi&quot; by Pope Paul VI and &quot;Redemptoris missio&quot; by Pope John Paul II.

=== Print and new media in mission ===
Christian mission organisations have long depended on the printed word as a channel through which to do mission. At times when countries have been &quot;closed&quot; to Christians, great efforts have been made to smuggle Bibles and other literature into those countries. Brother Andrew, the founder of Open Doors, started smuggling Bibles into communist countries in the 1950s. Operation Mobilisation was established in 1957 by George Verwer. Other Christian publishers, such as Plough Publishing, provide free books to people in the UK and US as a form of mission. The Bible Society translates and prints Bibles, in an attempt to reach every country in the world.

The internet now provides Christian mission organisations a convent way of reaching people in the form of podcasts. Podcasts provide a way of dissemination for a message that has potential to endanger the recipient, since it is very hard to track who has downloaded a specific podcast. An example of this is the Crescent Project. Other podcasts, such as the Life Together podcast, The Sacred, and Harvest are aimed at both non-Christians and Christians in the home country.

=== Reverse mission ===

The shift in world Christian population from Europe and North America to the non-Western world, and the migration of Africans, Asians, and Latin Americans to the West has given rise to what some have termed &quot;reverse mission&quot;. It demonstrates a reversal of the missionary movement, in that it reverses the direction of earlier missionary efforts.

=== Inter-organizational missions===
Globalization of the 21st century has served as a platform for opportunity for independent Christian organizations to unite together in cooperation for outreach missions and discipleship.

Some organizations are Christian consortiums which organizationally band themselves together like 50,000 persons in the Illinois-based Missio Nexus organization led by Ted Esler.

Other organizations are united by a common source of financial funding, cooperation in outreach projects and digital communications between internal missions personnel around the world and their partners like SIM or the various church and non profit ministries associated with the GMNF Global Mission Society. GMNF&#x27;s founder is Anton R. Williams of Grand Rapids Michigan who provides direction and support for the organization and its partnerships through Anton R. Williams Ventures (Holding Company and subsidiaries) of Grand Rapids, Michigan. This missions organization is unique for its use of Dallas Theological Seminary, the largest nondenominational seminary in the world for not only educating personnel but use of material for all aspects of its ministries.

Still other organizations sign legal contacts with an agencies to join for specific functions in missions like the SIMS organization.

==Criticism==
In 1924, Mahatma Gandhi wrote:

In India, Hindu organisations such as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh assert that most conversions undertaken by zealous evangelicals occur due to compulsion, inducement or fraud. In the Indian state of Tripura, the government has alleged financial and weapons-smuggling connections between Baptist missionaries and rebel groups such as the National Liberation Front of Tripura. The accused Tripura Baptist Christian Union is a member body of the Baptist World Alliance.

In mid-May, the Vatican was also co-sponsoring a meeting about how some religious groups abuse liberties by proselytizing, or by evangelizing in aggressive or deceptive ways. Iraq ... has become an open field for foreigners looking for fresh converts. Some Catholic Church leaders and aid organizations have expressed concern about new Christian groups coming in and luring Iraqis to their churches with offers of cash, clothing, food or jobs. ... Reports of aggressive proselytism and reportedly forced conversions in mostly Hindu India have fueled religious tensions and violence there and have prompted some regional governments to pass laws banning proselytism or religious conversion. ... Sadhvi Vrnda Chaitanya, a Hindu monk from southern India, told CNS that India&#x27;s poor and uneducated are especially vulnerable to coercive or deceptive methods of evangelization. ... Aid work must not hide any ulterior motives and avoid exploiting vulnerable people like children and the disabled, she said.

In an interview with &quot;Outlook&quot; magazine, Sadhvi Vrnda Chaitanya said &quot;If the Vatican could understand that every religious and spiritual tradition is as sacred as Christianity, and that they have a right to exist without being denigrated or extinguished, it will greatly serve the interests of dialogue, mutual respect, and peaceful coexistence.&quot;

=== Communicating diseases ===
European explorers in the Americas introduced Afro-Eurasian diseases to which Amerindian peoples had no immunity, leading to tens of millions of deaths. Missionaries, along with other travelers, brought diseases into native populations. Smallpox, measles, and common cold, have been blamed on their arrivals. David Igler of the University of California, Irvine, includes missionary activity as a cause of spreading germs. However, he says that commercial traders were the main agents of disease:
===Aid and evangelism===
While there is a general agreement among most major aid organizations not to mix aid with proselyting, others see disasters as a useful opportunity to spread the word. One such an occurrence was the tsunami that devastated parts of Asia on December 26, 2004.

&quot;This (disaster) is one of the greatest opportunities God has given us to share his love with people,&quot; said K.P. Yohannan, president of the Texas-based Gospel for Asia. In an interview, Yohannan said his 14,500 &quot;native missionaries&quot; in India, Sri Lanka and the Andaman Islands are giving survivors Bibles and booklets about &quot;how to find hope in this time through the word of God.&quot; In Krabi, Thailand, a Southern Baptist church had been &quot;praying for a way to make inroads&quot; with a particular ethnic group of fishermen, according to Southern Baptist relief coordinator Pat Julian. Then came the tsunami, &quot;a phenomenal opportunity&quot; to provide ministry and care, Julian told the Baptist Press news service. ... Not all evangelicals agree with these tactics. &quot;It&#x27;s not appropriate in a crisis like this to take advantage of people who are hurting and suffering&quot;, said the Rev. Franklin Graham, head of Samaritan&#x27;s Purse and son of evangelist Billy Graham.

The Christian Science Monitor echoes these concerns: &quot;&#x27;I think evangelists do this out of the best intentions, but there is a responsibility to try to understand other faith groups and their culture,&#x27; says Vince Isner, director of FaithfulAmerica.org, a program of the National Council of Churches USA.&quot;

The Bush administration has made it easier for U.S. faith-based groups and missionary societies to tie aid and church together.
For decades, US policy has sought to avoid intermingling government programs and religious proselytizing. The aim is both to abide by the Constitution&#x27;s prohibition against a state religion and to ensure that aid recipients don&#x27;t forgo assistance because they don&#x27;t share the religion of the provider. ... But many of those restrictions were removed by Bush in a little-noticed series of executive orders – a policy change that cleared the way for religious groups to obtain hundreds of millions of dollars in additional government funding. It also helped change the message American aid workers bring to many corners of the world, from emphasizing religious neutrality to touting the healing powers of the Christian God.

===Christian counter-claims===
Missionaries say that the government in India has passed anti-conversion laws in several states that are supposedly meant to prevent conversions from &quot;force or allurement&quot;, but are primarily used, they say, to persecute and criminalize voluntary conversion due to the government&#x27;s broad definition of &quot;force and allurement&quot;. Any gift received from a Christian in exchange for, or with the intention of, conversion is considered allurement. Voice of the Martyrs reports that aid-workers claim that they are being hindered from reaching people with much needed services as a result of this persecution. Alan de Lastic, Roman Catholic archbishop of New Delhi states that claims of forced conversion are false.

&quot;&#x27;There are attacks practically every week, maybe not resulting in death, but still, violent attacks,&#x27; Richard Howell, general secretary of the Evangelical Fellowship of India tells The Christian Science Monitor today. &#x27;They [India&#x27;s controlling BJP party] have created an atmosphere where minorities do feel insecure.&#x27;&quot; According to Prakash Louis, director of the secular Indian Social Institute in New Delhi, &quot;We are seeing a broad attempt to stifle religious minorities and their constitutional rights ... Today, they say you have no right to convert, Tomorrow you have no right to worship in certain places.&quot; Existing congregations, often during times of worship, are being persecuted. Properties are sometimes destroyed and burnt to the ground, while native pastors are sometimes beaten and left for dead.

Political scientist Robert Woodberry claims that conversionary Protestants were a crucial catalyst in spreading religious liberty, education, and democracy. While his historical analysis is exhaustive, the accompanying empirical evidence suffers from severe inconsistencies. Elena Nikolova and Jakub Polansky replicate Woodberry&#x27;s analysis using twenty-six alternative democracy measures and extend the time period over which the democracy measures are averaged. These two simple modifications lead to the breakdown of Woodberry&#x27;s results. Overall, no significant relationship between Protestant missions and the development of democracy can be established.

A major contribution of the Christian missionaries in Africa, China, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Korea, and other places was better health care of the people through hygiene and introducing and distributing soap, and &quot;cleanliness and hygiene became an important marker of being identified as a Christian&quot;.

<text>Mark Raymond King (born 20 October 1958) is an English musician. He is the lead singer and bassist of the jazz-funk band Level 42. King is known for his slap style of playing the bass guitar, with MusicRadar describing him as &quot;the guy who put the slap in pop during the 80s&quot;. King received a BASCA Gold Badge Award in October 2015 in recognition of his contribution to British music. He won the &quot;Outer Limits&quot; award at the 2017 Progressive Music Awards.

==Early life==
King was born and brought up in Cowes, Isle of Wight, off the south coast of mainland England. His father, Raymond King, was a dairyman, and the family lived in a tied dairy house. King recalled in a 2006 newspaper interview, &quot;it was post-war, with one brass tap, an outside toilet and a zinc bath in front of the fire&quot;. He later lived on the Camp Hill and Albany prison estates on the outskirts of Newport. He attended Kitbridge Middle School where he met his childhood sweetheart Tracey Wilson, later writing a song about her. He then went to Cowes High School.

Originally, King began his musical career as a drummer (starting aged nine after his father bought him his first kit for £10) and learning guitar aged 11. In 1974, when he was fifteen, King met his future Level 42 bandmate Phil Gould, who remembers the young King &quot;came and sat in with the band that I formed, at one of the gigs we were doing. He brought his kit down and blew me off, blew me off the stage because he was so much faster than me&quot;. Gould also remembers the young King as being a budding multi-instrumentalist, a &quot;really good guitarist&quot; who would &quot;play around with programming, synth stuff. He was one of those natural musicians.&quot;

King received encouragement to pursue a career in music from his music teacher at middle school, but was asked to leave Cowes High School at the age of 17 when he came to school wearing denim jeans. King recalls in a magazine interview: &quot;It didn&#x27;t go down very well, and I was told my schooling had run its course.&quot; King then left home and stayed at a friend&#x27;s house for two weeks, sleeping on the floor, before getting a job on a production line at a Ronson lighter factory. After quitting this job, King became a milkman, but he was still determined to &quot;prove [he] was not a failure&quot;. So, aged 19, King moved to London, along with his milk van, in hope of finding a career in music. He played drums for the band Re-Flex in their early years, before starting his career as a bass player.

== Career ==

=== Level 42 ===

King moved to London at the age of 19, subsequently forming Level 42 in 1979 with Phil Gould, keyboard player Mike Lindup and Phil&#x27;s guitarist brother Boon. Although a drummer, King found himself having to learn bass after landing a job at Macari&#x27;s, a musical instrument store. In an interview with the magazine &quot;Music U.K.&quot; (May 1984 issue), he states:
I kept up playing drums until I moved to London. I&#x27;d always wanted to be a good drummer and it&#x27;s just ironic that I&#x27;ve turned out to be a bass player. The way I started playing bass was that when I arrived in London I was looking for a job, and the only place I could find one was in Macaris in Charing Cross Rd. I wanted to get something involved in music, and that seemed like a good place to be. But Macaris didn&#x27;t sell drums, and so I lied and said I could play bass. They said, &quot;Fine, you sell the basses, and sweep up and get the coffees and whatever&quot;.
Nevertheless, King&#x27;s natural rhythmic intuition probably contributed to his distinctive bass playing style, along with the popularity of jazz-funk in Britain at the time.

At one of their first gigs, at the La Babalu club in Ryde, Level 42 were spotted by Andy Sojka, the head of small independent record label Elite and signed them. The next year, they were signed to Polydor and King spent the next nine years recording and touring with the band. The first Top 40 single, &quot;Love Games&quot;, was released in 1981, heralding the band&#x27;s first appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. The big breakthrough came with the release of &quot;The Sun Goes Down (Living It Up)&quot; in 1983.

While in Level 42, King found his bass-playing services in some demand. He was invited by Nik Kershaw to play on his second album &quot;The Riddle&quot; (1984) and by Midge Ure to play on his albums &quot;The Gift&quot; (1985) and &quot;Answers to Nothing&quot; (1988). He also performed on David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Tumble And Twirl&quot;, from the Tonight album. 

Level 42 supported The Police in 1981, followed by tours with Steve Winwood and Queen in 1986 and Madonna in 1987.

Level 42 released the album &quot;Retroglide&quot; in 2006 and a European tour followed.

Level 42 (line up: Mark King, Mike Lindup, Gary Husband, Nathan King, Sean Freeman) toured in autumn of 2008.

=== Solo work ===
In 1984, he released his first solo album &quot;Influences&quot;, which was followed by &quot;One Man&quot; in 1998.

In 1999, he issued a collection of unused songs in the form of the album &quot;Trash&quot;; the name hinted at the rough, unpolished nature of the recordings (which were rejected by Virgin Records in favour of the tracks which would ultimately appear on the &quot;One Man&quot; album).

&quot;Trash&quot; was a historic release as it was issued without a record company and initially offered to fans via a low-key guestbook entry, made by King, on www.level42.com. Using an Apple Mac, CD burner and inkjet printer, King manufactured the CD himself and posted it directly to fans, charging £17 plus postage. He hand signed and numbered early copies. Clearly not anticipating the popularity of the album, the initial CDs were numbered as part of a series of 100. Word soon spread of the CD and King eventually sold over 1,000 copies.

In the years following &quot;Trash&quot;, King repeated the successful &#x27;home-made&#x27; formula releasing a string of live recordings including &quot;Live at the Jazz Cafe&quot;, &quot;Live on the Isle of Wight&quot; and &quot;Live at Reading Concert Hall&quot; (which despite being performed as a Mark King solo show, was released under the name of Level 42 as King retained the rights to the name shortly before releasing the CD). Despite being contracted to Universal Music imprint W14, King continues to release live shows on his own Summerhouse Record label, of which 2007&#x27;s &quot;Retroglide Live&quot; DVD was the first.

Since coming back into the limelight in 1998 with &quot;One Man&quot; and the supporting UK tour, King has toured consistently around Europe and as far east as Indonesia. With the exception of &quot;Trash&quot;, he has only issued one new professionally released studio album in the eight-year period, September 2006&#x27;s &quot;Retroglide&quot; under the Level 42 banner.

In 2016, King joined supergroup Gizmodrome, also featuring Stewart Copeland, Adrian Belew and Vittorio Cosma. The band released their debut album in September 2017.

In 2019 King played and sang on Taylor Hawkins and the Coattail Riders song &quot;Queen of the Clowns&quot; from the album &quot;Get the Money&quot;.

== Playing style ==

King helped to develop and popularize the slap and pop style of playing the bass guitar in the 1980s. The slapping and popping style was developed in the 1970s by funk bassists such as Larry Graham and further developed by jazz fusion bassists such as Stanley Clarke and Marcus Miller. King developed a rapid playing speed using this technique, and introduced technical elements that enabled him to produce a mix of percussive effects while still playing a bass line.

One of King&#x27;s greatest influences was the musician Tom Taylor, who gave King guitar lessons when King was 12.

King&#x27;s bass playing style is largely based on continuous 16th notes (aka semiquavers), sometimes described as &quot;machine-gun&quot; style. This &quot;machine-gun&quot; style consists of playing rapidly using a combination of thumb slaps, pops, hammer-ons, and fretting hand slaps.

King also took part in a comedy skit titled &quot;The Easy Guitar Book Sketch&quot; with comedian Rowland Rivron and fellow British musicians Mark Knopfler, Lemmy from Motörhead, David Gilmour and Gary Moore.

== Instruments ==

King has used various models of bass guitar through the years; the two most commonly used brands have been Jaydee and Status Graphite. The Jaydees were built by John Diggins, a former employee of John Birch; &quot;Jaydee&quot; is phonetic for his initials, J.D. King also used a Pangborn Warlord bass, perhaps two, hand-built by luthier Ashley Pangborn, in the early 1980s.

King has used Status Graphite basses since the 1980s including the Series-2000 and Empathy models. In November 2000, Rob Green and King developed the Status KingBass, a headless, double cut-away bass with a woven graphite through-neck, Status Hyperactive pickups and active electronics.

Other known basses he has used are Alembics (specifically custom Series II models), of which there is a Signature Mark King model, Pangborn basses, a Zon bass. King&#x27;s first fretless bass was a Japanese-made &quot;Moon&quot; Jazz-style bass. King also owned two Music Man Stingray basses, a Wal bass, which was fitted with an MB4 MIDI interface.

In 1996, King briefly used Fender Jazz Basses. A limited run of 42 &quot;Mark King&quot; Jazz Basses were made, based on the American Deluxe series, built and set up to King&#x27;s specifications.

King endorses RotoSound strings and uses their Funkmaster set (.30-.50-.70-.90) on his instruments.

==Personal life==
Just before his divorce from his wife Pia, King moved back to his native Isle of Wight in 1988. During the 1990s, King purchased a pub in Ryde. King sold the pub in 2000 King lives with his current wife Ria and youngest daughter.

He is the elder brother of fellow Level 42 and Frost* member Nathan King.

=== Activism ===
King is a longstanding supporter of The Prince&#x27;s Trust. On 20 June 1986, King and Lindup performed alongside stars such as Eric Clapton, Rod Stewart, Phil Collins, Mark Knopfler, Midge Ure and Elton John, at The Prince&#x27;s Trust All-Star Rock Concert at Wembley Arena to celebrate the first 10 years of the Trust; a recording was subsequently released on video. He was also a performer at The Prince&#x27;s Trust Rock Gala at the Royal Albert Hall in November 2010 and 2011.

King serves as a tourism &#x27;ambassador&#x27; for his native Isle of Wight.

<text>Compulsory figures or school figures were formerly a segment of figure skating, and gave the sport its name. They are the &quot;circular patterns which skaters trace on the ice to demonstrate skill in placing clean turns evenly on round circles&quot;. For approximately the first 50 years of figure skating as a sport, until 1947, compulsory figures made up 60 percent of the total score at most competitions around the world. These figures continued to dominate the sport, although they steadily declined in importance, until the International Skating Union (ISU) voted to discontinue them as a part of competitions in 1990. Learning and training in compulsory figures instilled discipline and control; some in the figure skating community considered them necessary to teach skaters basic skills. Skaters would train for hours to learn and execute them well, and competing and judging figures would often take up to eight hours during competitions.

Skaters traced compulsory figures, and were judged according to their smoothness and accuracy. The circle is the basis of all figures. Other elements in compulsory figures include curves, change of foot, change of edge, and turns. Skaters had to trace precise circles while completing difficult turns and edges. The simple &quot;figure eight&quot; shape was executed by connecting two circles; other figures included the three turn, the counter turn, the rocker turn, the bracket turn, and the loop.

Since 2015 with the founding of the World Figure Sport Society and the World Figure &amp; Fancy Skating Championships &amp; Festival on black ice more skaters are training and competing in figures. More coaches are learning the new methods developed by World Figure Sport to teach them to skaters, as some skaters and coaches believe that figures give skaters an advantage in developing alignment, core strength, body control, and discipline. The World Figure Sport Society conducts workshops, festivals and world competitions in compulsory (now known as fundamental figures), special, creative, free, flying figures, and fancy skating

==History==

===Early history===
Tracing figures in the ice is the oldest form of figure skating, especially during its first 200 years of existence when it was a recreational activity practiced mostly by men. Combined skating, or &quot;patterns of moves for two skaters around a common center marked by a ball and later an orange placed on the ice&quot;, had a &quot;profound historical significance&quot; to the sport that eventually manifested itself in ice dancing, pair skating, and synchronized skating, and dominated the sport for 50 years in England during the 18th century. &quot;The Art of Skating&quot;, one of the earliest books about figure skating, was written by Robert Jones in 1772 and described five advanced figures, three of which were illustrated with large color plates. Jones&#x27; limited body of figures, which emphasized correct technique, were the accepted and basic repertoire of figures in 18th-century England. The Edinburgh Skating Club, one of the oldest skating clubs in the world, described combined figures and those done by multiple skaters; interlocking figure eights were the most important. According to writer Ellyn Kestnbaum, the Edinburgh Skating Club required prospective members to pass proficiency tests in what became compulsory figures. The London Skating Club, founded in 1830 in London, also required proficiency tests for members and pioneered combined skating, which contributed to the evolution of school figures. Artistic skating in France, which was derived from the English style of figure skating and was influenced by ballet, developed figures that emphasized artistry, body position, and grace of execution. Jean Garcin, a member of an elite group of skaters in France, wrote a book about figure skating in 1813 that included descriptions and illustrations of over 30 figures, including a series of circle-eight figures that skaters still use today.

George Anderson, writing in 1852, described backward-skating figures, including the flying Mercury and the shamrock, as well as the Q figure, which became, in its various forms, an important part of the repertoire of skating movements for the rest of the 1800s. Anderson also described two combined figures, the salutation (already described by Jones) and the satellite. By the 1850s, the most important figures (eights, threes, and Qs) were developed and formed the basis for figure skating at the time. In 1869, Henry Vandervell and T. Maxwell Witham from the London Skating Club wrote &quot;System of Figure Skating&quot;, which described variations of the three turn (the only figure known before 1860), the bracket (first done on roller skates), the rocker, the Mohawk, the loop, the Q, and other figures. The Mohawk, renamed in Canada to the C Step in 2020, a two-foot turn on the same circle, most likely originated in North America. Figure skating historian James Hines called grapevines, which was probably invented in Canada, &quot;the most American of all figures&quot;. The Viennese style of figure skating, as described by Max Wirth&#x27;s book in 1881, described connecting figures, which ultimately led to modern free skating programs.

In 1868, the American Skating Congress, precursor to U.S. Figure Skating, adopted a series of movements used during competitions between skaters from the U.S. and Canada. Until 1947, for approximately the first 50 years of the existence of figure skating as a sport, compulsory figures made up 60 percent of the total score at most competitions around the world. Other competitions held in the late 19th and early 20th centuries included special figures, freeskating, and compulsories, most of the points they earned going towards how they performed the same set of compulsory moves. The first international figure skating competition was in Vienna in 1882; according to Kestnbaum, it established a precedent for future competitions. Skaters were required to perform 23 compulsory figures, as well as a four-minute freeskating program, and a section called &quot;special figures&quot;, in which they had to perform moves or combinations of moves that highlighted their advanced skills.

Compulsory figures were an important part of figure skating for the rest of the 19th century until the 1930s and 1940s. The first European Championships in 1891 consisted of only compulsory figures. In 1896, the newly formed International Skating Union (ISU) sponsored the first annual World Figure Skating Championships in St. Petersburg. The competition consisted of compulsory figures and free skating. Skaters had to perform six compulsory moves so that judges could compare skaters according to an established standard. Compulsory figures were worth 60 percent of the competitors&#x27; total scores.

Special figures were not included in World Championships, although they were included as a separate discipline in other competitions, including the Olympics in 1908. The early Olympics movement valued and required amateurism, so figure skating, almost from its beginnings as an organized sport, was also associated with amateurism. Athletes were unable to support themselves financially, so as Kestnbaum put it, &quot;thus making it impossible for those who had to earn a living by other means to attain the same level of skill as those who were independently wealthy or who practiced professions that allowed for flexible scheduling&quot;. According to Kestnbaum, this had implications for attaining proficiency in compulsory figures, which required long hours of practice and purchasing time at private rinks and clubs.

In 1897, the ISU adopted a schedule of 41 school figures, each of increasing difficulty, which was proposed by the British. They remained the standard compulsory figures used throughout the world in proficiency testing and competitions until 1990, and U.S. Figure Skating continued to use them as a separate discipline in the 1990s. After World War II, more countries were sending skaters to international competitions, so the ISU cut the number of figures to a maximum of six due to the extended time it took to judge them all. The first judges&#x27; handbook for compulsory figures was published by the ISU in 1961.

===Demise in 1990 and Modern Renaissance in 2015===

The demise and revival of compulsory figures occurred, respectively, in 1990, when the ISU removed compulsory figures from international single skating competitions, and beginning in 2015, when the first competition focusing entirely on figures took place. Judging scandals and the broadcasts of figure skating on television have been cited as the reason for the decline of figures. The U.S. was the last country to include figures in their competitions, until 1999. The elimination of figures resulted in the increase of focus on the free skating segment and in the domination of younger girls in the sport. Most skaters stopped training with figures, although many coaches continued to teach figures and skaters continued to practice them because figures taught basic skating skills and gave skaters an advantage in developing alignment, core strength, body control, and discipline.

A revival of compulsory figures began in 2015. The first World Figure Championships (renamed to The World Figure and Fancy Skating Championships in 2017) occurred in Lake Placid, New York. By 2023, nine championships had taken place. Judging was done blind, after the skaters left the ice and without the judges knowing which competitor completed which figure. Karen Courtland Kelly, 1994 Olympian and figures expert, who founded the World Figure Sport Society (WFSS) and organized its figures championships, was credited with revitalizing figures. By 2020, the championship and the revitalization of figures was supported by many skaters, including U.S. Olympian Debi Thomas, who competed at the 2023 Championships.

==Execution of figures==
Compulsory figures, also called school figures, are the &quot;circular patterns which skaters trace on the ice to demonstrate skill in placing clean turns evenly on round circles&quot;. Compulsory figures are also called &quot;patch&quot;, a reference to the patch of ice allocated to each skater to practice figures. Figure skating historian James Hines reports that compulsory figures were &quot;viewed as a means of developing technique necessary for elite skaters&quot;. He states, &quot;As scales are the material by which musicians develop the facile technique required to perform major competitions, so compulsory figures were viewed as the material by which skaters develop the facile required for free-skating programs&quot;. Compulsory figures has been called &quot;the slow-sports movement&quot; or &quot;yoga on ice&quot;. Hines also states that although compulsory figures and free skating are often considered as &quot;totally different aspects of figure skating&quot;, historically they were not, and insisted that &quot;spirals, spread eagles, jumps, and spins were originally individual figures&quot;.

Skaters were required to trace these circles using one foot at a time, demonstrating their mastery of control, balance, flow, and edge to execute accurate and clean tracings on the ice. The compulsory figures used by the International Skating Union (ISU) in 1897 for international competitions consisted of &quot;two or three tangent circles with one, one and a half, or two full circles skated on each foot, in some with turns or loops included on the circles&quot;. The patterns skaters left on the ice, rather than the shapes the body made executing them, became the focus of artistic expression in figure skating into the 20th century. The quality of the figures, along with the skater&#x27;s form, carriage, and speed in which they were executed, was emphasized, not the intricacy of unique designs of the figures themselves. Skaters had to execute figures by positioning themselves to precisely control the edges of one blade of their skates by leaning in or out, moving forward or backward. They also had to use their right or left foot while balancing the other foot in order to avoid going off course, then they had to repeat everything five more times. Louise Radnofsky stated, &quot;Controlling the trails a skate blade leaves requires timing, precision, body awareness, nailing an upper body turn without throwing the lower body off, tolerating punishing burn on the muscles of one leg&quot;. Olympic champion Debi Thomas stated, about the execution of figures, &quot;It takes incredible strength and control. You are literally using every single muscle in your body. It looks slow and easy, but it&#x27;s not … but if you lay our a great figure, it’s an amazing feeling&quot;. 

The highest quality figures had tracings on top of each other; their edges were placed precisely, and the turns lined up exactly. The slightest misalignment or shift of body weight could cause errors in the execution of figures. American figure skating champion Irving Brokaw insisted that form was more essential to the production of figures than the tracings themselves because the skater needed to find a comfortable and natural position in which to perform them. He expected skaters to trace figures without looking down at them because it gave &quot;a very slovenly appearance&quot;, and recommended that they not use their arms excessively or for balance like tightrope walkers. Brokaw wanted skaters to remain upright and avoid bending over as much as they could. Brokaw also thought that the unemployed leg, which he called the &quot;balance leg&quot;, was as important as the tracing leg because it was used as much in the execution of a figure as the tracing leg. The balance leg also should be bent only slightly, since he believed bending it too much removed its usefulness and appeared clumsy.

Writer Ellyn Kestnbaum notes that skaters who were adept at performing compulsory figures had to practice for hours to have precise body control and to become &quot;intimately familiar with how subtle shifts in the body&#x27;s balance over the blade affected the tracings left on the ice&quot;. She adds that many skaters found figures and their visible results calming and rewarding. Sports writer Christie Sausa insists that training in figures &quot;helps create better skaters and instills discipline, and can be practiced over a lifetime by skaters of all ages and abilities&quot;. As Louise Radnofsky put it, for skaters that practiced figures, &quot;there&#x27;s joy in the frustration of never achieving perfection, zen in repetition, inclusivity in voluntarily doing something that generations of skaters complained about -- and, for once in a child-driven sport, superiority in maturity&quot;. The German magazine declared in 1983 that compulsory figures stifled skaters&#x27; creativity because not much about figures had changed in 100 years of competitions.

===Figure elements===

All compulsory figures had the following: circles, curves, change of foot, change of edge, and turns. The circle, the basis of all figures, was performed on both its long and short axes. Skaters had to trace precise circles, while completing difficult turns and edges. Most figures employ &quot;specific one-foot turns not done in combination with other one-foot turns&quot;. Each figure consisted of two or three tangent circles. Each circle&#x27;s diameter had to be about three times the skater&#x27;s height, and the radii of all half-circles had to be approximately the same length. Half-circles and circles had to begin and end as near as possible to the point in which the long and short axes intersected. The figure&#x27;s long axis divided it longitudinally into equal-sized halves, and the figure&#x27;s short axes divided the figures into equal-sized .

Curves, which are parts of circles, had to be performed with an uninterrupted tracing and with a single clean edge, with no subcurves or wobbles. Brokaw insists that curves had to be done on all four edges of the skate while skating both backwards and forwards. He states, &quot;It is the control of these circles that gives strength and power, and the holding of the body in the proper and graceful attitudes, while it is the execution of these large circles, changes of edges, threes and double-threes, brackets, loops, rockers and counters, which makes up the art of skating&quot;. Curves also included the forced turn (or bracket) and the serpentine.

A change of foot, which happened during the short time the skater transferred weight from one foot to the other, was allowed in the execution of figures, but had to be done in a symmetrical zone on each side of the long axis. Skaters could choose the exact point in which they placed their foot in this zone, although it typically was just after the long axis, with the full weight of the body on the skate. It was at this point that tracing began. A change of edge happened at the point in which the long and short axes intersected. Its trace had to be continuously and symmetrically traced and could not be S-shaped. The edge change had to be as short as possible, and could not be longer than the length of the skate blade. Turns were skated with a single clean edge up to and after the turn, but with no double tracings, no skids or scrapes, or no illegal edge change either before, during, or after a turn. The turns&#x27; cusps had to be the same size, and the entry into and out of a turn had to be symmetrical.

The simple &quot;figure eight&quot; shape was executed by connecting two circles &quot;about three times the height of the skater with one circle skated on each foot&quot;. The figure eight has four variations: inside edges, outside edges, backward, and forward. A turn added at the halfway point of each circle increased the level of complexity. Other figures included three-lobed figures with a counter turn or a rocker turn, which were completed at the points where the lobes touched. Counters and rockers had to be executed symmetrically, with no change of edge, with the points of their turns either pointing up or down or lying along the figure&#x27;s long axis, and could not be beaked or hooked. Brackets, like threes, had to be skated on a circle, their turns&#x27; points either pointing up or down or lying along the figure&#x27;s long axis.

Skaters also performed a group of smaller figures called loops. The diameter of the loop&#x27;s circular shape had to be about the height of the skater, and they could not have any scrapes or points on the ice. The place in which the skater entered into or exited out of the crossing of both the loop tracing and the center of the loop had to sit on the figure&#x27;s long axis, where the loop was divided into symmetrical halves. The center of the loop figure to the place in which the skater entered into or exited out of the loop&#x27;s crossing had to measure five-sixths of the circle&#x27;s diameter. The loop&#x27;s length had to be about one-third of the distance from the place in which the skater entered into or exited out of the loop&#x27;s crossing of the loop tracing to the figure&#x27;s short axis. The loop&#x27;s width had to be about two-thirds of its length. The Q figure begins at the tail of the figure, on the skater&#x27;s outside edge. It can also begin on any of the four edges, and the direction in which it can be skated can be reversed. When the circle is skated first, it is called a reverse Q. Altered forms of the Q figure often do not look like the letter &quot;q&quot;, but &quot;simply employ a serpentine line and a three turn&quot;. United shamrocks, spectacles (shapes that trace the shape of eyeglasses), and united roses are alterations of the basic Q figures.

Since the goal of figures is drawing an exact shape on the ice, the skater had to concentrate on the depth of the turn (how much the turn extends into or out of the circle), the integrity of the edges and cusps (round-patterned edges leading into or out of the circle), and its shape. There were three types of three turns: the standard three, the double three, and the paragraph double three. The three turn had to be skated on a circle, its turns&#x27; points either pointing up or down or lying along the figure&#x27;s long axis. For the double three, the points of both threes had to be directed towards the center of each circle, and had to divide the circle into three equal curves. The middle curve had to divide the circles into halves by the figure&#x27;s long axis. The paragraph double three, which was executed at the highest levels of competition, was done by tracing &quot;two circles with two turns at each circle, all on one foot from one push-off&quot;. The paragraph double three was difficult to accomplish because the shape and placement of the turns had to be perfectly symmetrical, the turns had to be done on a true edge with no scrapes on the ice, and the circles had to be the same size and exactly round. All combined compulsory figures are illustrated below:

==Judging==

&quot;Der Spiegel&quot; compared judging compulsory figures to the work of forensic scientists. After the skaters completed tracing figures, the judges scrutinized the circles made, and the process was repeated twice more. According to Randy Harvey, compulsory figures took five hours to complete at U.S. National Championships and eight hours at World Championships. At the 1983 European Championships, the compulsory segment began at 8 am, and lasted six hours. According to Louise Radnofsky, who claimed that the execution of figures could be &quot;very boring—and worse to watch&quot;, the most exciting physical move was a change of direction. Radnofsky also stated, &quot;Results of a performance were generally visible only to skaters and judges before being swept away&quot;.

The ISU published the first judges&#x27; handbook for during compulsory figure competitions in 1961. Skaters were judged on the ease and flow of their movement around the circles, the accuracy of the shapes of their bodies, and the accuracy of the prints traced on the ice. Judges took note of the following: scrapes, double tracks that indicated that both edges of their blades were in contact with the ice simultaneously, deviations from a perfect circle, how closely the tracings from each repetition followed each other, how well the loops lined up, and other errors.

<text>A military operation (op) is the coordinated military actions of a state, or a non-state actor, in response to a developing situation. These actions are designed as a military plan to resolve the situation in the state or actor&#x27;s favor. Operations may be of a combat or non-combat nature and may be referred to by a code name for the purpose of national security. Military operations are often known for their more generally accepted common usage names than their actual operational objectives.

==Types of military operations==
Military operations can be classified by the scale and scope of force employment, and their impact on the wider conflict. The scope of military operations can be:

* Theater: this describes an operation over a large, often continental, area of operation and represents a strategic national commitment to the conflict, such as Operation Barbarossa, with general goals that encompass areas of consideration outside the military, such as the economic and political impact of military goals on areas concerned.
* Campaign: this describes either a subset of the theatre of operation, or a more limited geographic and operational strategic commitment, such as the Burma Campaign, and need not represent total national commitment to a conflict, or have broader goals outside the military impact.
* Battle: this describes a subset of a campaign that will have specific military goals and geographic objectives, as well as clearly defined use of forces, such as the Battle of Gallipoli, which operationally was a combined arms operation originally known as the &quot;Dardanelles landings&quot; as part of the Dardanelles Campaign, where about 480,000 Allied troops took part.
* Engagement: this describes a tactical combat event or contest for a specific area or objective by actions of distinct units. For example, the Battle of Kursk, also known from its German designation as Operation Citadel, included many separate engagements, several of which were combined into the Battle of Prokhorovka. The Battle of Kursk, in addition to describing the initial German offensive operation, also included two Soviet counter-offensive operations: Operation Kutuzov and Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev.
* Strike: this describes a single attack, upon a specified target. This often forms part of a broader engagement. Strikes have an explicit goal, such as rendering facilities such as airports inoperable, assassinating enemy leaders, or limiting the delivery of supplies to enemy troops.

==Definition==
==Operational level of war==
The operational level of war occupies roughly the middle ground between the campaign&#x27;s strategic focus and the tactics of an engagement. It describes &quot;a distinct intermediate level of war between military strategy, governing war in general, and tactics, involving individual battles&quot;. For example, during World War II, the concept applied to use of Soviet Tank Armies.

<doc id="666313" wikidata="Q7941677" url="?curid=666313" title="Voodoo Science">
<text>Voodoo Science: The Road from Foolishness to Fraud is a book published in 2000 by physics professor Robert L. Park, critical of research that falls short of adhering to the scientific method. Other people have used the term &quot;voodoo science&quot;, but amongst academics it is most closely associated with Park. Park offers no explanation as to why he appropriated the word &quot;voodoo&quot; to describe the four categories detailed below. The book is critical of, among other things, homeopathy, cold fusion and the International Space Station.

==Categories==

Park uses the term &quot;voodoo science&quot; (see the quote section below, Page 10) as covering four categories which evolve from self-delusion to fraud:

* pathological science, wherein genuine scientists deceive themselves
* junk science, speculative theorizing which bamboozles rather than enlightens
* pseudoscience proper, work falsely claiming to have a scientific basis, which may be dependent on supernatural explanations
* fraudulent science, exploiting bad science for the purposes of fraud

Park criticizes junk science as the creature of &quot;scientists, many of whom have impressive credentials, who craft arguments deliberately intended to deceive or confuse.&quot;

==Examples cited==
* Perpetual motion, free energy suppression and fringe physics claims
** Robert Fludd
** Garabed T. K. Giragossian
** The Energy Machine of Joseph Newman
** Better World Technologies (Dennis Lee)
** Blacklight Power, formerly HydroCatalysis (Randell Mills)
** Cold fusion (Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann)
** Patterson Power Cell (James Patterson)
** Gravitational shielding (Eugene Podkletnov)
* Human spaceflight (in terms of actual importance to science since the rise of robotic spacecraft)
** International Space Station (for claims of necessity to conduct scientific research)
** Gerard K. O&#x27;Neill, L5 Society and space colonization
** Robert Zubrin, Mars Society, Biosphere 2 and a human mission to Mars
* Voodoo science protected by government secrecy
** Project Mogul and the Roswell UFO incident resulting in a loss of public trust, as well as the later alien autopsy video hoax
** Edward Teller and Lowell Wood&#x27;s work on the Strategic Defense Initiative (especially regarding the X-ray laser, but also &quot;Brilliant Pebbles&quot;)
** Great Oil Sniffer Hoax
* Superstitions and pseudoscience
** Mars effect (astrology) claimed by Michel Gauquelin
** Parapsychology (e.g. Robert G. Jahn and Dean Radin)
* Placebos and alternative medicine
** Vitamin O
** Homeopathy
*** water memory (proposed by Jacques Benveniste)
** Animal magnetism
** Magnet therapy
** Therapeutic touch (debunked by Emily Rosa at age nine)
* Other health claims
** Maharishi Effect (using Transcendental Meditation (TM) to effect a decrease in societal violence; the spike in murders during the 1993 Washington D.C. study is specifically mentioned)
** Deepak Chopra (who makes claims linking Ayurveda (traditional medicine native to India) with quantum mechanics)
** Electromagnetic radiation and health (especially related to power lines and cancer risk)
*** &quot;Paul Brodeur and &quot;Microwave News&quot; in particular, had given the public a seriously distorted view of the scientific facts.&quot; (Page 158)
* Contributing factors
** Mainstream media reporting voodoo science uncritically as infotainment
** Abolition of the Office of Technology Assessment
** Establishment of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine
Park also discusses the Daubert standard for excluding junk science from litigation.

==Quotes==
* &quot;I came to realize that many people choose scientific beliefs the same way they choose to be Methodists, or Democrats, or Chicago Cubs fans. They judge science by how well it agrees with the way they want the world to be.&quot; (Pages VIII-IX)
* &quot;[P]ractitioners [of &quot;pseudoscience&quot;] may believe it to be science, just as witches and faith healers may truly believe they can call forth supernatural powers. What may begin as an honest error, however, has a way of evolving through almost imperceptible steps from self-delusion to fraud. The line between foolishness and fraud is thin. Because it is not always easy to tell when that line is crossed, I use the term &quot;voodoo science&quot; to cover them all: pathological science, junk science, pseudoscience and fraudulent science. This book is meant to help the reader to recognize voodoo science and to understand the forces that seem to conspire to keep it alive.&quot; (Page 10)
* &quot;The integrity of science is anchored in the willingness of scientists to test their ideas and results in direct confrontation with their scientific peers.&quot; (Page 16)
* &quot;America&#x27;s astronauts have been left stranded in low-Earth orbit, like passengers waiting beside an abandoned stretch of track for a train that will never come, bypassed by the advance of science.&quot; (Page 91)
* &quot;Few scientists or inventors set out to commit fraud. In the beginning, most believe they have made a great discovery. But what happens when they finally realize that things are not behaving as they believed?&quot; (Page 104)
* &quot;[T]he uniquely American myth of the self-educated genius fighting against a pompous, close-minded establishment.&quot; (Page 112)
* &quot;They are betting against the laws of thermodynamics. No one has ever won that wager.&quot; (Page 138)

==Warning signs==

Drawing on examples used in &quot;Voodoo Science&quot;, Park outlined seven warning signs that a claim may be pseudoscientific in a 2003 article for &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;:

# Discoverers make their claims directly to the popular media, rather than to fellow scientists.
# Discoverers claim that a conspiracy has tried to suppress the discovery.
# The claimed effect appears so weak that observers can hardly distinguish it from noise. No amount of further work increases the signal.
# Anecdotal evidence is used to back up the claim.
# True believers cite ancient traditions in support of the new claim.
# The discoverer or discoverers work in isolation from the mainstream scientific community.
# The discovery, if true, would require a change in the understanding of the fundamental laws of nature.

==Reception==

Matt Nisbet in the &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; noted that the reaction to &quot;Voodoo Science&quot; has been mostly favorable.

Bob Goldstein in a book review for &quot;Nature Cell Biology&quot; described Park as an equivalent to Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould, scientific writers who have &quot;talent for defending a view of the world that is perfectly rational and free of witchcraft and superstition.&quot;

American chemist Nicholas Turro wrote &quot;the book is entertaining and provocative reading... Whether or not you agree with Park&#x27;s take on voodoo science, a message of the book is that if scientists do not take a more significant role in the way that science is disseminated to the public and especially to politicians, voodoo science will continue to survive.&quot;

The mathematician Malcolm Sherman in the &quot;American Scientist&quot; gave the book a positive review stating &quot;Park does more than analyze and expose various kinds of bad (&quot;voodoo&quot;) science. He demonstrates how valid science is distorted or ignored by the media and by those (including scientists) seeking to influence public policy.&quot; The physicist Kenneth R. Foster also positively reviewed the book concluding &quot;Park is an articulate and skeptical voice of reason about science.&quot;

Reviewing the book for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Ed Regis compared it positively to the 1957 book by Martin Gardner, &quot;Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science&quot;, calling &quot;Voodoo Science&quot; a &quot;worthy successor&quot; and praising it for explaining why various purportedly scientific claims were in fact impossible. Science writer Kendrick Frazier wrote &quot;Robert Park has brought us a book that has a freshness and originality—and an importance and potential for influence—perhaps not seen since Gardner’s first.&quot;

Robin McKie for &quot;The Observer&quot; described it as &quot;an admirable analysis: wittily written, vivid and put together without a hint of malice.&quot;

Rachel Hay in a review wrote that Park had &quot;debunked expertly&quot; pseudoscience topics such as homeopathy, cold fusion and perpetual motion machines but the book is not easily accessible to students. However, S. Elizabeth Bird an anthropology professor recommended it for &quot;students who need to establish a grasp of the scientific method.&quot;

Bruce Lewenstein wrote a critical review claiming Park had lumped together pathological science, junk science, pseudoscience and fraud all together as voodoo science but this is problematic as &quot;each category alone is fraught with definitional, historical, and analytical difficulties.&quot; Brian Josephson wrote that the book, while giving &quot;the official story regarding a number of &#x27;mistaken beliefs&#x27; &quot;, did not provide &quot;the additional information that might lead one to conclude that the official view does not tell the whole story.&quot;

<text>Jason David Schmidt (born January 29, 1973), is an American former Major League Baseball pitcher. In his career, he has played for the Los Angeles Dodgers (2007–2009), San Francisco Giants (2001–06), Pittsburgh Pirates (1996–2001) and Atlanta Braves (1995–96), by whom he had been drafted in the eighth round, 206th overall, of the 1991 draft.

==Career==

===High school===
Schmidt attended Kelso High School in Kelso, Washington, where he played football and basketball in addition to baseball. In 1991 as a senior he tossed a no-hitter, striking out 20 of 21 batters he faced. He was named Washington&#x27;s Gatorade State Player of the Year and All-State MVP in baseball. He was offered a scholarship to the University of Arizona but chose to sign with the Atlanta Braves after they drafted him in the eighth round of the 1991 MLB Draft.

===Early days in the Braves organization===
Schmidt made his professional debut with the Gulf Coast Braves in 1991, starting eleven games and finishing with a 3–4 record and 2.38 ERA. He worked his way through the Braves farm system from 1992 to 1995, playing with the Pulaski Braves (1992-rookie league), Macon Braves (1992-Class A), Durham Bulls (1993-Class A), Greenville Braves (1994-Class AA) and Richmond Braves (1995-Class AAA).

He made his major league debut in relief on April 28, 1995, against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Schmidt recorded his first ML victory in his first start, pitching eight scoreless innings against the Chicago Cubs on September 3, 1995.

In 1996 he started the season in the Braves rotation but also spent time in Richmond and on the disabled list before he was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates (with Ron Wright) for Denny Neagle on August 30, 1996.

===Pittsburgh Pirates===
As a member of the Pirates, Schmidt won 10, 11, and 13 games in 1997, 1998, and 1999, respectively. However, he was on a losing team each season in Pittsburgh. He was the last player on the team to wear number 42, as all of Major League Baseball retired it for Jackie Robinson in 1997, except those who chose to keep the number (e.g. Mariano Rivera). Schmidt then switched to number 22 for the remainder of his stay with the team, and wore number 29 after leaving the Pirates.

===San Francisco Giants===

Schmidt was then acquired by the Giants in 2001 with John Vander Wal in exchange for Armando Ríos and Ryan Vogelsong. Schmidt saw more success in San Francisco. Between his stints in Pittsburgh and San Francisco during the 2001 season, Schmidt compiled thirteen wins. Schmidt re-signed as a free agent with San Francisco that winter, in what would become a five-year $41 million deal. He went on to win thirteen again in 2002 when the Giants made a World Series appearance, but lost to the Anaheim Angels. Schmidt started Games 1 and 5 of the 2002 World Series, picking up the win in Game 1 and a no-decision in Game 5. In 2003, he won 17 games. Schmidt threw a 2–0 shutout in Game 1 of the 2003 NLDS, beating Josh Beckett, but his team lost once again in the playoffs, this time to the Florida Marlins. Schmidt was an All-Star this year as well as the league leader with a 2.34 earned run average. He placed second to Éric Gagné in the 2003 National League Cy Young Award voting.

On May 18, 2004, Jason Schmidt pitched a one-hitter against the Chicago Cubs and Matt Clement. The Giants won the game, 1–0. This performance was overshadowed by Randy Johnson&#x27;s perfect game against the Atlanta Braves the same day. Schmidt also pitched a one-hitter against the Boston Red Sox one month later on June 20, 2004. Schmidt would go on to win 18 games in 2004 and be voted the TSN Pitcher of the Year in the National League, and fourth in Cy Young voting. He also set a San Francisco single-season record of 251 strikeouts, which was broken when Tim Lincecum struck out 265 in 2008.

On June 6, at AT&amp;T Park, in a 2–1 win over the Florida Marlins, Schmidt pitched a complete game and struck out a career-high 16 batters. The game included a ninth-inning wild pitch that moved base runners to second and third with no outs. Schmidt struck out the final three batters of the game, starting with cleanup hitter Miguel Cabrera, Josh Willingham and Jeremy Hermida. Not only did he tie the franchise all-time single-game strikeouts record originally set by Christy Mathewson of the New York Giants on October 3, , against the St. Louis Cardinals, but he also surpassed Gaylord Perry&#x27;s San Francisco Giants single-game strikeouts record, when Perry struck out 15 batters on July 22, , against the Philadelphia Phillies. In addition, he set AT&amp;T Park&#x27;s individual single-game strikeout record in the short history of the ballpark.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
Schmidt signed a three-year, $47 million deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers prior to the 2007 season. After only three starts he missed forty-five days with a right shoulder injury before being reactivated from the disabled list (DL) on June 5. He started three games after his return from the DL, the last two created more concern. On June 18 he was returned to the DL and underwent exploratory surgery to find the cause of his ineffectiveness. The damage to his shoulder was more severe than expected and he missed the rest of the 2007 season due to injury. The Dodgers hoped to have Schmidt back before the end of the 2008 season, but manager Joe Torre later said that Schmidt would not be back, making only a few rehab starts in the minors during the year.

Heading into 2009, Schmidt was expected to compete for a spot in the Dodgers&#x27; rotation but pitched poorly in spring training and began the season once more on the disabled list. After several rehab starts in the minors, Schmidt was activated on July 20, 2009, to start against the Cincinnati Reds, his first appearance in a Major League game since 2007. He went five innings, allowed three runs and picked up the win. He made another start on July 26 against the Florida Marlins, but pitched poorly and allowed five runs (four earned) in three innings and was credited with the loss. He started against the Atlanta Braves on July 31 and pitched six shutout innings, getting the win as the Dodgers won 5–0. On August 7, he was again placed on the DL, with Torre speculating that Schmidt&#x27;s career might be over.

==Accomplishments==
* 3× MLB All-Star (2003–2004, 2006)

==Records==
San Francisco Giants Records
* 16 strikeouts in a single-game on June 6, , against the Florida Marlins at AT&amp;T Park (tied with Christy Mathewson)

==Personal life==
Schmidt and his wife Bethany have three children: Makynlee (born January 14, 2001), Mason (born January 29, 2004), and Madden (born April 22, 2007). Schmidt&#x27;s mother Vicki died from brain cancer on April 22, 2003, at age 53.

<text> (Latin for &quot;desiring with supreme ardor&quot;), sometimes abbreviated to , was a papal bull regarding witchcraft issued by Pope Innocent VIII on 5 December 1484.

==Witches and the Church==
Belief in witchcraft is ancient. in the Hebrew Bible states: &quot;Let there not be found among you anyone who immolates his son or daughter in the fire, nor a fortune-teller, soothsayer, charmer, diviner, or caster of spells, nor one who consults ghosts and spirits or seeks oracles from the dead.&quot;

Pope Gregory VII wrote to Harald III of Denmark in 1080 forbidding witches to be put to death upon presumption of their having caused storms or failure of crops or pestilence. According to Herbert Thurston, the fierce denunciation and persecution of supposed sorceresses which characterized the witchhunts of a later age, were not generally found in the first thirteen hundred years of the Christian era.

According to historians such as Martin Del Rio and P.G. Maxwell-Stuart, &quot;The early Church had set out the distinctions between white and black magic... The penalties were restricted to confession, repentance, and charitable work&quot;.

==Dominican Inquisition origin==
The bull was written in response to the request of Dominican Inquisitor Heinrich Kramer for explicit authority to prosecute witchcraft in Germany, after he was refused assistance by the local ecclesiastical authorities, who maintained that as the letter of deputation did not specifically mention where the inquisitors may operate, they could not legally exercise their functions in their areas. The bull sought to remedy this jurisdictional dispute by specifically identifying the dioceses of Mainz, Cologne, Trier, Salzburg, and Bremen.

Innocent&#x27;s Bull enacted nothing new. Its direct purport was to ratify the powers already conferred upon Kramer (also known as &quot;Henry Institoris&quot;) and James Sprenger to deal with witchcraft as well as heresy, and it called upon the Bishop of Strasburg (then Albert of Palatinate-Mosbach) to lend the inquisitors all possible support. Some scholars view the bull as &quot;clearly political&quot;, motivated by jurisdictional disputes between the local German Catholic priests and clerics from the Office of the Inquisition who answered more directly to the pope.

==Content==
The bull recognized the existence of witches:

Many persons of both sexes, unmindful of their own salvation and straying from the Catholic Faith, have abandoned themselves to devils, incubi and succubi, and by their incantations, spells, conjurations, and other accursed charms and crafts, enormities and horrid offences, have slain infants yet in the mother&#x27;s womb, as also the offspring of cattle, have blasted the produce of the earth, the grapes of the vine, the fruits of the trees, nay, men and women, beasts of burthen, herd-beasts, as well as animals of other kinds, vineyards, orchards, meadows, pasture-land, corn, wheat, and all other cereals; these wretches furthermore afflict and torment men and women, beasts of burthen, herd-beasts, as well as animals of other kinds, with terrible and piteous pains and sore diseases, both internal and external; they hinder men from performing the sexual act and women from conceiving ... they blasphemously renounce that Faith which is theirs by the Sacrament of Baptism, and at the instigation of the Enemy of Mankind they do not shrink from committing and perpetrating the foulest abominations and filthiest excesses to the deadly peril of their own souls ... the abominations and enormities in question remain unpunished not without open danger to the souls of many and peril of eternal damnation.

It gave approval for the Inquisition to proceed &quot;correcting, imprisoning, punishing and chastising&quot; such persons &quot;according to their deserts&quot;. The bull essentially repeated Kramer&#x27;s view that an outbreak of witchcraft and heresy had occurred in the Rhine River valley, specifically in the bishoprics of Mainz, Cologne, and Trier, as well as in Salzburg and Bremen, including accusations of certain acts.

The bull urged local authorities to cooperate with the inquisitors and threatened those who impeded their work with excommunication. Despite this threat, the bull failed to ensure that Kramer obtained the support he had hoped for, causing him to retire and to compile his views on witchcraft into his book &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot;, which was published in 1487. The &quot;Malleus&quot; professed, in part fraudulently, to have been approved by the University of Cologne, and it was sensational in the stigma it attached to witchcraft as a worse crime than heresy and in its notable animus against women. 

&quot;Summis desiderantes affectibus&quot; was published as part of the preface of the book, implying papal approval for the work. However, the &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot; received an official condemnation by the Church three years later, and Kramer&#x27;s claims of approval are seen by modern scholars as misleading.

The bull, which synthesized the spiritual and the secular crimes of witchcraft, is often viewed as opening the door for the witchhunts of the early modern period. However, its similarities to previous papal documents, emphasis on preaching, and lack of dogmatic pronouncement complicate this view.

<doc id="666329" wikidata="Q1592082" url="?curid=666329" title="Hazelton, British Columbia">
<text>Hazelton is a village municipality in the Skeena region of west central British Columbia, Canada. The place is on the southeast side of the Skeena River immediately north of the Bulkley River mouth, where the confluence forms a peninsula. On BC Highway 62, the locality is by road about northwest of Smithers and northeast of Terrace. Hazelton is the original of the &quot;Three Hazeltons&quot;, the other two being New Hazelton to the southeast and South Hazelton to the south.

==Geography==
The two rivers flow through the broad forested glacial valleys. The Roche de Boule range forms the southern wall of the Skeena valley. To the north are the Skeena Mountains and to the northwest the Kispiox Range. Layered sandstone and shale lie beneath the Hazeltons area. About 25,000 years ago, the ice sheet was thick. Over the past 11,000 years, the rivers have cut down through the thick moraine exposing the bedrock.

==First Nations and early European contacts==
First Nations have inhabited the area for at least 7,000 years.

In the 1840s, Simon McGillivray, a Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) chief trader, led an expedition from Babine Lake to what would become Hazelton.

In 1865, a survey party for the Russian–American Telegraph ventured up the Skeena to this point and left supplies for the construction crew arriving the following year. In 1866, the telegraph line was extended from Quesnel via 
Fort Fraser and passed the future Hazelton that July, before terminating farther north. In 1867, the line north of Quesnel was abandoned.

During 1866–1868, the HBC operated the Ackwilgate fur trading post immediately south across the Bulkley at Mission Point.

The abandoned telegraph trail provided access for prospectors. During the Omineca Gold Rush of 1870–1871, the Hazelton settlement became strategic. As many as 4,000 miners made it a base. After the goldrush ended, European residents dwindled to a handful.

In 1881, William Collison founded the Anglican mission at Hazelton among the Gitxsan. In July 1888, the militia was sent from Victoria to quell an indigenous uprising at Hazelton, following the killing of Kitwancool Jim. On being informed the tension had subsided, only special constables went upriver to investigate, while the militia camped near Port Essington. Weeks later, the militia returned to base.

The Anglican Church ran the federal government-funded Hazelton First Nations school 1889–1950.

In 1958, the original museum, called the House of Treasures was built in town to display indigenous artifacts. In 1968, the building was moved half a mile to the Ksan Historical Village, which was being developed as a combined campsite and village where area First Nations would produce, display, and sell, their arts and crafts. A special totem pole was carved and erected for the 1969 opening of the village. Items were carved on site from wood or animal horn and displayed for sale. By 1972, six houses stood in a line beside the original tiny museum, creating an authentically rebuilt indigenous village.

In 1994, the Wet&#x27;suwet&#x27;en Education Society broke into the vacant, former Hazelton High School building, intending to commandeer the premises for indigenous programs.

In 2012, a six-month blockade of the Gitxsan Treaty Society office ended peacefully.

The Ksan Historical Village and Museum has expanded into seven decorated tribal houses fronted with several carved totems. Carvers demonstrate their skills to visitors, and the Ksan Dancers, who perform local native dances, present scheduled performances.

==Name origin==
The earliest newspaper reference to The Forks, the original name, was 1859, and to Hazelton, was 1872. Thomas Hankin, who staked the settlement in 1857, named it after the numerous hazelnut bushes in the vicinity. However, the former name remained predominant initially, before the two names became used together or interchangeably until the end of that century.

==Pre-railway==
In 1870, the Cunningham &amp; Hankin partnership, which would become R. Cunningham &amp; Son, opened a branch store. By the early 1870s, a saloon and stores existed. By 1874, two stores remained, after one closed the prior winter.

In 1880, the HBC purchased the W.J. Walsh store. This warehouse became the place from which supplies were forwarded via the Hazelton–Babine portage and Fort Babine to other HBC posts. Charles William Digby Clifford was the resident HBC postmaster 1885–1887. By the late 1880s, a police officer was based in the community, and a jail was built at the time.

During 1890–1915, Hazelton was the largest community in northwest BC. At the head of navigation on the Skeena, the place was the centre of activity for prospectors, traders, merchants, packtrain operators, and missionaries.

In 1891, Richard S. Sargent arrived, becoming a leading figure in the community. That year, the HBC SS &quot;Caledonia&quot; was the first steamboat to navigate the Kitselas Canyon and reach Hazelton. However, both high and low water made the canyon impassable, limiting navigation to three months per year. Sargent was the inaugural government postmaster 1899–1927 and opened a trading post in 1900.

In 1900, St Peter&#x27;s Anglican church was built. In 1901, the federal government telegraph service completed the Yukon Telegraph, which passed through Hazelton, linking Ashcroft with the Alaskan border In 1907, R.S. Sargent&#x27;s store/post office burned to the ground. The expectation that the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTP) would be built via Hazelton, led to an auction of lots in the vicinity and a revival of Hazelton. Since Hazelton proper was crammed onto surrounded by reserves, expansion was at Two Mile, also called the Hazelton City Addition.

In 1908, Joseph Leopold Coyle established the Omineca Herald newspaper. By this time, several stores and the Hazelton and Omineca hotels existed. The route southeastward to Aldermere (adjacent to Telkwa) was used by a weekly stage in summer and sleighs in winter. In February 1909, the Ingenica Hotel opened. That year, a new police district headquartered at Hazelton was created, the government offices moved from an old log shack into a new building, and a new jail replaced the dilapidated two-cell log shack.

In 1910, fire consumed the Hazelton Hotel, a 42-bed bunkhouse was erected at the back of the Omineca Hotel, and the post office moved into an addition to the Sargent store. That year, a fire department was formed and two chemical engines ordered. The Union Bank opened a branch in temporary premises, and a community hall was built. By this time, a wagon road ran southwestward to Skeena Crossing.

The Pacific Highway Association offered a gold medal to the first car to travel from Seattle to Hazelton, which was the tentative terminus of an ambitious highway scheme. In October 1911, P.E. Sands and his mechanic completed the journey in a Flanders 20. Lacking a road north of Quesnel, they followed the old telegraph trail. For about of this section, it was necessary to dismantle the vehicle for hauling with horses. This was the only gap not covered under motor power. The motorists were honored by a banquet before returning south by steamboat, train, and steamship. The awarded medal has been retained in Hazelton since 2013. The automobile is on display at the Kittitas County Historical Museum in Ellensburg, Washington.

In 1911, the rebuilt Hazelton Hotel opened with 32 guest rooms and a bunkhouse which accommodated another 30 people. Mid-year, the Bank of Vancouver opened a branch, initially using a tent, and the Inland Colonist relocated from Kitselas but publishing ceased that November. The Omineca Miner newspaper was launched that August.

In 1912, a series of suspicious stable fires occurred. Months later, fire destroyed the HBC and Broughton &amp; McNeil warehouses. Further arson occurred a week later, when a fire at a vacant residence was extinguished before causing serious damage. For decades, residents had speculated every spring when the loud whistle of the first boat would be heard, even wagering large sums of money. The arrival would be welcomed with cheers to mark winter bleakness transitioning into new life. When the steamboat departed at the end of the 1912 season, this era drew to a close.

==Ferries and bridges==
In 1910, a suspension bridge across the Skeena opened by road north of Hazelton.

During 1911 and 1912, a ferry linked Sealey and Hazelton. During 1912, steamboats connected the rail head at Skeena Crossing with Hazelton.

The Hazelton–South Hazelton ferry across the Bulkley operated from mid-1912 until replaced by a low level bridge in January 1917 at the same location.

In July 1914, towers were constructed for the Skeena ferry (a large scow to replace the canoe in use). Prior to the commencement of operations in August, a boat temporarily attached to the ferry cable capsized, and a youth on board drowned. By October, the service was fully operational.

In 1923–24, a new pontoon reaction ferry was installed.

To replace the Hagwilget high level bridge and the Hazelton low level bridge, the rebuilt Hagwilget suspension bridge was officially opened in 1931. That year, the Skeena ferry was carried downstream to Ritchie. A few days later, it floated farther down and beached at Pacific. High water damaged the ferry in 1935. The towers, which were built in 1920, were reset in 1936. During the 1936 flood, the ferry house floated away, riverbank erosion washed out sections of road on both shores, and the ferry tower was twisted on the Hazelton side.

In 1953, the ferry was withdrawn.

==Post-railway arrival==
In 1913, the Ingenica Hotel relocated to New Hazelton, but the HBC rebuilt its burned premises on the same site. Sidewalks were constructed on both sides of Main St. The number of resident automobiles increased to six, and the first vehicle travelling from the Mexico–United States border arrived.

In the battle between South Hazelton and New Hazelton to displace old Hazelton on the arrival of the railway, the former proved a non-starter and the latter remained much smaller than the old township after railway construction activity moved on. Old Hazelton remained the chief supply point for district.

In 1914, when the C.V. Smith store/residence burned down, the structure was rebuilt. When the Bank of Vancouver branch closed, the Royal Bank opened in the vacated premises, before moving months later. When the Union Bank relocated to larger premises, the former ones were repurposed as a Methodist church, before the congregation moved to St Andrew&#x27;s Hall. That year, the HBC store was enlarged.

In 1915, the Royal Bank closed and the Union Bank closed its New Hazelton sub-branch. C.V. Smith erected a new warehouse for his store. In 1917, fire levelled the Sam Lee store/laundry, the Omineca Herald moved to New Hazelton, Northern Telephone installed a new switchboard, and the provincial government offices moved to Smithers. In 1918, the Omineca Miner ceased publication.

On Christmas night, 1920, fire destroyed much of the central business district. This may have been the fire that burned down St Andrew&#x27;s Hall. In January 1921, fire broke out in the former Ingenica Hotel. Sam Lee, who operated the Royal Café in the building, sustained fatal burns. Months later, the RCMP headquarters moved to Telkwa, leaving just one constable stationed at Hazelton. In 1922, Hazelton Methodist Church was built. That April, a guest burned to death, when fire completely destroyed the Hazelton Hotel and several other buildings. In May 1925, the Royal Bank absorbed the Union Bank, rebranding the latter local branch. In 1928, R.S. Sargent opened a hotel.

In 1931, fire completely destroyed the Omineca Hotel and several other buildings. In 1932, the Royal Bank branch closed and the Sargent hotel and two warehouses burned down. In 1937, William John Sanders, a former Sergeant-at-arms in the BC Legislature died at his residence.

In 1947, Canadian Trailway Stages inaugurated a Hazelton–Prince George bus service, but the Hazelton–Vanderhoof leg was discontinued the next year. In 1948, the First Nations band surrendered of the reserve for sale to the public as lots in a subdivision, increasing the size of Hazelton from . The present downtown covers about because not all lots sold.

In 1949, the BC Power Commission entered into an agreement to operate the hospital generator and purchased Kitanmax Water and Power Co, the local distributor which supplied 68 customers. The transmission lines were extended to South Hazelton and New Hazelton. The next year, the commission replaced the DC generator at the hospital with a larger AC one, which also became the plant for supplying existing Hazelton customers and new ones south of the Bulkley.

By 1951, the RCMP had a two-person detachment. That year, a Royal Bank sub-branch opened. In February 1956, Hazelton was incorporated as a village. When the Inlander Hotel opened that year, the Royal Bank rented the lower level prior to building across the street. The Sargent family, the proprietors, had operated a smaller hotel in another building which had burned down shortly before. In 1959, the Royal Bank became a full branch and the New Hazelton one closed.

In 1963, BC Hydro increased the electricity supply capacity by installing a 600-kilowatt unit. During 1965–1972, the streets were first paved. In 1969, the current one-storey brick-veneer post office was built. Later that year, a dial telephone system replaced switchboard operators.

In 1972, a new lounge opened at the Inlander Hotel in what was once bank premises. The men&#x27;s washroom was installed in the former vault. In July 1979, a homecoming weekend was held for former residents.

By the early 1980s, the RCMP had consolidated at New Hazelton.

In 1997, the Royal Bank moved to Hagwilget.

==Later community==
In 2003, fire seriously damaged the Inlander Hotel.

In 2017, BC Transit introduced a Terrace–Hazeltons bus service and remains the current passenger transit provider.

In 2023, construction began on a three-storey building near the hospital, which provides 31 new affordable rental units.

A walking tour of the downtown area includes antique pioneer machinery displays, an original steam donkey, heritage sites, the Pioneer Museum, a riverboat replica, and the historic St. Peter&#x27;s Anglican Church.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Hazelton had a population of 257 living in 113 of its 125 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 313. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Education==
In 1906, the one-room school opened in a building provided rent free by the HBC.

In 1913, a new schoolhouse replaced the old building, which had become too small to accommodate the 23 enrolled students.

In 1926, the school raised to rural status, and in 1930, a second classroom was added.

In 1948–49, the status raised from Hazelton Superior to Hazelton Elementary-Senior High. At the time, the facility was described as a fine new modern school, with seven rooms and seven teachers.

In 1962–63, the Two Mile elementary school opened. In 1963–64, John Field Elementary opened at Hazelton. In 1965–66, Hazelton Elementary-Senior High became Hazelton Secondary.

In 1979, the two-room Two Mile school closed.

In March 1992, the new Hazelton Secondary construction replaced the former building.

In 2014, John Field Elementary was renamed Majagaleehl Gali Aks, which means &quot;flowers of the rivers&quot; in the Gitxsan language.

Part of School District 82 Coast Mountains, Majagaleehl Gali Aks stands on the descent to the downtown area, and Hazelton Secondary (to the northeast) has about 375 enrolled students. Adjacent to the secondary is a campus of the Coast Mountain College.

==Healthcare==
In 1904, Dr. Horace Cooper Wrinch opened the first hospital, which developed a nursing school, gardens and dairy farm. Owned by the Methodist Church, funding came from the church, the province, Indian Affairs, and the public.

About one mile east of Hazelton, the two-storey main building, included an attic and basement. The facility comprised five staff and 13 beds in 1904, seven staff and 17 beds in 1909, and 12 staff and 33 beds in 1911. The latter increase came from adding a new wing in 1910. Patient care was private, semi-private, and public. By that time, the of cleared land grew vegetables and livestock feed.
By 1912, of the grounds were cleared. The lake was and birch clumps formed a natural park. The main road passed through the property. In 1914, the hospital was wired for electricity.

When the second rebuild opened in 1930, the facility was renamed the Wrinch Memorial Hospital.

By 1972, the hospital was a 50-bed facility with plans to double the capacity. A single storey structure adjacent to the existing building opened in 1977.

In 2002, the province reversed plans to downsize the hospital, retaining the nine acute care beds, the long-term beds, and the teaching role.

Part of Northern Health, the hospital provides acute, complex and community care, assisted living, and both shorter and longer term accommodation. The double occupancy rooms include 10 publicly subsidized long-term care beds. Outpatient care is supported. A BCAS station is based on the grounds.

==Climate==
Hazelton has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;). Winters are cold but are milder than what the latitude may suggest, owing to Pacific air masses. The average temperature in January is and from December to February, there are an average of 32 days where the maximum temperature reaches or surpasses freezing. However, Arctic air masses can push temperatures below , occurring on average three days per year. The average annual snowfall is . Summers are warm, with a July daytime high of although night time temperatures are cool, with a July low of . In an average summer, there are seven days where the temperature exceeds . The average annual precipitation is , with March and April being the driest months and October through January being the wetter months. The record high was on August 20, 1977 and the record low was on January 8, 1991.

<doc id="666342" wikidata="Q936955" url="?curid=666342" title="Parishes of Jamaica">
<text>The parishes of Jamaica are the main units of local government in Jamaica. They were created following the English settlement of Jamaica in 1655. This administrative structure for the Colony of Jamaica developed slowly. However, since 1 May 1867, Jamaica has been divided into the current fourteen parishes. These were retained after independence in 1962. They are grouped into three historic counties, which no longer have any administrative relevance. Every parish has a coast; none are landlocked.

==List==



==History==

===Early history===
Following the English conquest of Jamaica the first phase of colonisation was carried out by the Army, with a system of Regimental plantations. These were drawn up on the southern flat lands, with the Regimental commanders charged with ordering their men to plant provisions.

Certain key figures such as Luke Stokes (1656) and Thomas Modyford (1664) brought substantial numbers of colonists from other English colonies. In 1662 the first census was carried out. There were no parishes and the division of the island into ten districts.

===Creation of the parishes===

Under Governor Modyford the island was divided into precincts and parishes and he commissioned a map of the island featuring these. The first parishes were:

*Saint Catherine
*Clarendon
*Liguanea (St Andrew)
*Saint Thomas
*Port Royal
*Saint John
*Saint David

By 1675, the following parishes had been added:

*Vere (separated from Clarendon in 1673)
*Saint George
*Saint Thomas in the Vale
*Saint Dorothy
*Saint Ann
*Saint Elizabeth
*Saint James
*Saint Mary

In 1677, An Act for Regulating the Parishes fixed the boundaries of each parish.

===The Grant reforms===

The crisis highlighted by the Morant Bay rebellion led to the dissolution of the House of Assembly of Jamaica, and the colonial administration being turned into a crown colony. John Peter Grant was appointed Governor arriving in August 1866, and he set about instituting a number of reforms, including the administrative framework of the parishes. He introduced the by which the 22 existing parishes to 14 through the A Law to Reduce the Number of Parishes (1867/No. 20).
Parishes have been a feature of local administration in Jamaica since the island was captured by the English in 1655. The number has varied over time and some no longer exist having either been absorbed into or divided between neighbouring parishes. At the peak, 1841–1865, there were 22 (the current 14 plus those listed below).

The current set of parishes was established in 1866 with the elimination of the 8 listed below (roughly by county):

Surrey:
*Port Royal (now divided between Kingston and Saint Andrew)
*Saint George (now divided between Saint Mary and Portland)
*Saint David (now part of Saint Thomas)

Middlesex:
*Metcalfe (now part of Saint Mary)
*Saint Dorothy (now part of Saint Catherine)
*Saint John (now part of Saint Catherine)
*Saint Thomas in the Vale (now part of Saint Catherine)note that the current Saint Thomas used to be named &quot;Saint Thomas in the East&quot; to differentiate between the two parishes at the time.
*Vere (now part of Clarendon)

==Counties of Jamaica==
Jamaica is divided into three historic counties, though they have no administrative function today. They were established in 1758 to facilitate the holding of courts along the lines of the British county court system.

The three counties are named for the English historic counties of Cornwall, Middlesex, and Surrey. Cornwall County was named for being the westernmost county, just like its namesake. Middlesex County was named for its location on the middle third of Jamaica. Surrey County was named for the English county in which Kingston upon Thames is found, because Kingston was its county town.

<doc id="666346" wikidata="Q219317" url="?curid=666346" title="University of Pavia">
<text>The University of Pavia (, UNIPV or &quot;Università di Pavia&quot;; ) is a university located in Pavia, Lombardy, Italy. There was evidence of teaching as early as 1361, making it one of the oldest universities in the world. It was the sole university in Milan and the greater Lombardy region until the end of the 19th century. In 2022, the university was recognized by the Times Higher Education among the top 10 in Italy and among the 300 best in the world. Currently, it has 18 departments and 9 faculties. It does not have a main campus; its buildings and facilities are scattered around the city, which is in turn called &quot;a city campus&quot;. The university caters to more than 20,000 students who come from Italy and all over the world.

The university offers more than 80 undergraduate programs; over 40 master programs, and roughly 20 doctoral programs (including 8 in English). About 1,500 students who enter the university every year are international students.

The university operates multiple cultural and scientific museums, including the University History Museum, a botanical garden, research centers, university libraries and a university press. The university is also affiliated with Policlinico San Matteo, at which hundreds of medical students from the university perform clinical rotations during their clinical years.

The University of Pavia is a member of the COIMBRA Group and European University Association. It also participates in the Erasmus Programme, which allows student exchanges between the University of Pavia and various universities in Europe.

==History==

=== Foundation and the Middle Ages ===
An edict issued by the Frankish king of Italy, Lothar I (ruled 818–55) mentions the existence of a higher education institution at Pavia as early as AD 825. This institution, mainly devoted to ecclesiastical and civil law as well as to divinity studies, was then selected as the prime educational centre for northern Italy.

In 1361, the institution was officially established as a &quot;studium generale&quot; by the Holy Roman emperor Charles IV, who granted the same teaching privileges enjoyed by the University of Paris and Bologna, allowing the institution to teach canon and civil law, philosophy, medicine and liberal arts. It was then expanded and renovated by the duke of Milan, Gian Galeazzo Visconti, becoming the sole university in the Duchy of Milan until the end of the 19th century. Gian Galeazzo worked tirelessly to consolidate the institution and in 1389, he obtained a permission from Pope Boniface IX to teach advanced theology courses.

It was divided into two distinct universities — of jurisprudence (teaching civil and canon law courses) and of arts (teaching medicine, philosophy and liberal arts courses). A rector was elected every year, normally a student who was over twenty years old. The institution offered bachelor, licentiate and doctoral degrees. Despite the politics and hardships due to wars and pestilence, it experienced great growth and the institution was considered to be prestigious as evidenced by the influx of foreign students at the time. In 1412, Filippo Maria Visconti further consolidated the universities, invited prominent scholars to teach there and declared an edict giving serious penalties aimed at preventing students from going elsewhere to study.

=== Renaissance and Modern Period ===
Towards the 15th century, prominent teachers such as Baldo degli Ubaldi, Lorenzo Valla, Giasone del Maino taught students in the fields of law, philosophy and literary studies. In the same years, Elia di Sabato da Fermo, personal doctor of Filippo Maria Visconti, was the first professor of medicine of the Jewish religion at a European university, while from 1490 a teaching of Hebrew was established at the university.
Not many years later, probably in 1511, Leonardo da Vinci studied anatomy together with Marcantonio della Torre, professor of anatomy at the university.
During the ongoing Italian War of 1521-6, the authorities in Pavia were forced to close the university in 1524. However, during the 16th century, after the university was re-opened, scholars and scientists such as Andrea Alciato and Gerolamo Cardano taught here. During the period in which the duchy of Milan was governed by the kings of Spain, the research and educational activities of the university stagnated, but there were still prominent scholars such as Gerolamo Saccheri who was still involved with the university.

The rebirth of the university was, in part, due to the initiatives led by Maria Theresa and Joseph II of the House of Austria, in the second half of the 18th century. The initiatives included massive renovations to the teaching programs, research and structure rehabilitations, which were still retained by the university until now.

Throughout its history, the university had benefited from the presence of many distinguished teachers and scientists who wrote celebrated works and made important discoveries — chemist Luigi Valentino Brugnatelli, mathematician Girolamo Cardano (born in Pavia, 1501–76), physicist Alessandro Volta (chair of natural philosophy 1769–1804), poet Ugo Foscolo (chair of eloquence 1809–10), playwright Vincenzo Monti, jurist Gian Domenico Romagnosi, naturalist Lazzaro Spallanzani, mathematician Lorenzo Mascheroni and anatomist Antonio Scarpa.

In 1858, the university was the scene of intense student protests against Austrian rule in northern Italy (through the kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia). The authorities responded by ordering the university&#x27;s temporary closure. The incidents at Pavia were typical of the wave of nationalist demonstrations all over Italy that immediately preceded the Unification (1859–66).

During the 19th century, the medical, natural science and mathematics schools were graced by prominent scientists who propelled the status of the university to new heights. Three Nobel Prize winners taught in Pavia — physician Camillo Golgi (at Pavia from 1861), who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology in 1906 for his studies on the structure of the nervous system, chemist Giulio Natta (at Pavia between 1933 and 1935) and physicist Carlo Rubbia. In addition, distinguished mathematicians Eugenio Beltrami, Felice Casorati and Luigi Berzolari were regular teachers in Pavia. It was also in the University of Pavia, in 1912, Carlo Forlanini discovered the first successful cure for tuberculosis — artificial pneumothorax. In the 1960s, the Faculty of Economics and Commerce as well as Engineering were added to the current lineup of faculties.

During the 20th century, teaching and research activities were carried out by additional prominent scholars such as Pasquale Del Giudice and Arrigo Solmi for law history; Contardo Ferrini and Pietro Bonfante for Roman law; Luigi Cossa and Benvenuto Griziotti for economy, Giacinto Romano for medieval and modern history and Plinio Fraccaro for ancient history.

Also critical to the university&#x27;s reputation was its distinguished record of public education, epitomized by the establishment of private and public colleges. The oldest colleges, the Collegio Borromeo and Collegio Ghislieri, were built in the 16th century, and in more recent times others were founded through both public and private initiatives — the Collegio Nuovo, the Collegio Santa Caterina and the other eleven colleges managed by EDiSU. In 1997 the IUSS, was established, a Higher Learning Institution () similar to the Scuola Normale Superiore and Istituto Superiore Sant&#x27;Anna in Pisa. The IUSS is the federal body that links the colleges of Pavia which constitute the Pavia University System.

Today, the university continues to offer a wide variety of disciplinary and inter-disciplinary teaching. Research is carried out in departments, institutes, clinics, centres and laboratories, in close association with public and private institutions, enterprises, and factories.

== Campus ==
The city of Pavia is essentially a city campus, so the campus buildings are located all around the city. The campuses for Faculty of Political Science and Law are located at Old Campus at Via Strada Nuova, near Pavia Cathedral. The campuses for Faculty of Engineering, Pharmacy, Mathematics, Physics and Natural Sciences are located at Via Ferrata, about 3 km away from the city center, in a building complex called Polo Cravino. The campuses for Faculty of Economics, Department of Psychology and Department of Philosophy are located at the Monastery of San Felice. The campus for Department of Musicology is located at Palazzo Raimondi, Cremona. The campuses for Faculty of Pharmacy and Medicine and Surgery are located at Via Forlanini and Via Taramelli, near Policlinico San Matteo.


=== Palazzo Centrale ===

The entrance to the Old Campus, which hosts the Faculty of Political Science and Law, is located at Via Strada Nuova. The palace has 9 courtyards — Cortile dei Caduti, Cortile di Volta, Cortile delle Statue, Cortile di Atilia Secundina, Cortile del Miliario, Cortile delle Magnolie, Cortile dei Tassi, Cortile Sforzesco, Cortile Teresiano. The palace also hosts more than 40 lecture theatres, including 8 lecture theatres for Faculty of Law and 10 lecture theatres for the Faculty of Political Science. The largest lecture theatre in the university is called Aula Magna, where inauguration ceremonies for graduations, white coat ceremonies and conferment of Medaglio Teresiana are held.

The palace dates back all the way to the 15th century. Originally, lessons by the university were held in private houses, in convents which provide suitable premises or in the same place as the municipal building. At the end of the 15th century, Ludovico il Moro assigned a building in Strada Nuova that belonged to Azzone Visconti to the university. Between 1661 and 1671, a major renovation was carried out under the guidance of the architect Ambrogio Pessina. During the 18th century, Maria Theresa of Austria wanted to make some improvements both to the education system and the building, thus she assigned the architect Giuseppe Piermarini and Leopoldo Pollack to oversee the renovations. Giuseppe Piermarini was in charge of the building facade and the courtyards, while Leopoldo Pollack was in charge of the lecture halls.

During the 19th century, the university also incorporated the former monastery of Leano, which was donated by Joseph II of Lorena Habsburg and expanded to Via Mentana, these works were entrusted to the architect Giuseppe Marchesi, who also constructed the Aula Magna.

In 1932, the university acquired a vast 15th century complex which belonged to San Matteo Hospital, thus completing its expansion. This complex now houses the Department of Molecular Medicine, which is in charge of the health courses.
=== Polo Cravino ===
The land where Polo Cravino was built was purchased by the university at end of 1960. The complex was designed by an architect Giancarlo De Carlo. In 1980, the buildings for Faculty of Engineering, Department of Genetics, lecture halls, laboratories as well as a complex for Institute of Molecular Genetics, under the National Research Council were completed. In 1990, buildings for Department of Mathematics, Department of Earth and Environmental Science and a Computer Center were added.

<doc id="666362" wikidata="Q1143699" url="?curid=666362" title="Cumberland Mountains">
<text>The Cumberland Mountains are a mountain range in the southeastern section of the Appalachian Mountains. They are located in western Virginia, southwestern West Virginia, the eastern edges of Kentucky, and eastern middle Tennessee, including the Crab Orchard Mountains. Their highest peak, with an elevation of above mean sea level, is High Knob, which is located near Norton, Virginia.

According to the USGS, the Cumberland Mountain range is long and wide, bounded by the Russell Fork on the northeast, the Pound River and Powell River on the southeast, Cove Creek on the southwest, and Tackett Creek, the Cumberland River, Poor Fork Cumberland River, and Elkhorn Creek on the northwest. The crest of the range forms the Kentucky and Virginia boundary from the Tennessee border to the Russell Fork River.

Variant names of the Cumberland Mountains include Cumberland Mountain, Cumberland Range, Ouasioto Mountains, Ouasiota Mountains, Laurel Mountain, and Pine Mountain. They are named for Prince William, Duke of Cumberland.

The Cumberland Mountains range includes Pine Mountain, Cross Mountain, Cumberland Mountain, Log Mountain, Little Black Mountain, and Black (Big Black) Mountain, as well as others.

==Conservation==
Oak Ridge National Laboratory (Oak Ridge, Tennessee) is involved with the conservation of the mixed mesophytic forests within the northern Cumberland Plateau in Tennessee. The conservation organizations include The Nature Conservancy, the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, and the Natural Resources Defense Council with focus on the Cumberland Plateau.

==Geology and physiography==
The Cumberland Mountains are a physiographic section of the larger Appalachian Plateau province, which in turn is part of the larger Appalachian physiographic division.

===Pine Mountain===
Pine Mountain is a long, narrow ridge starting in northern Tennessee and extending northeastward into southeastern Kentucky and southwestern Virginia. Its southwestern terminus is near Pioneer, Tennessee, and it extends approximately to the northeast to near the Breaks Interstate Park in Kentucky and Virginia.

====Geology====
Pine Mountain is at the headward ramp of the Pine Mountain Thrust Fault. The hard Lee-type sandstones of the Early Pennsylvanian form the ridge line. The sandstone strata crop out here because northwestward movement along the thrust fault caused these sandstones to be pushed up the ramp and over younger strata. Because the sandstones are resistant to erosion, they form a prominent ridge along this ramp. The southwestern terminus of Pine Mountain is marked by the northwest-trending Jacksboro Fault, a lateral ramp fault (part of the Pine Mountain Thrust Fault).

The northwestern slope of Pine Mountain is cliff-lined (escarpment slope) whereas the southeastern slope is gentle, this is the dip slope, and it is roughly parallel to the dip of the sandstones. This is also the northern limb of the Middlesboro Syncline.

Several gaps occur along Pine Mountain, and these are usually caused by erosion along cross-cutting faults. These gaps include the gap at High Cliff, Tennessee (near Jellico), the Narrows gap at Pineville, Kentucky, and Pound Gap near Jenkins, Kentucky. There are other minor gaps as well.

===Cumberland Mountain===
Cumberland Mountain, not to be confused with the Cumberland Mountains within which it resides, is a long ridge extending from northeastern Tennessee, southeastern Kentucky and southwestern Virginia. Its peak forms the boundary between Kentucky and Virginia in some areas. The southeastern side of Cumberland Mountain is a cliff-lined wall that was a barrier to exploration and settlement in Kentucky during the westward expansion in the late eighteenth century. The famous Cumberland Gap is one of several gaps along Cumberland Mountain that allowed access across the mountain.

Cumberland Mountain is a long ridge running from near Caryville, Tennessee, northeastward to near Norton, Virginia, a distance of approximately . The southeastern slope of the ridge is cliff lined, whereas the northwestern slope is more gentle. The ridge is interrupted by several gaps, including Cumberland Gap, Big Creek Gap between Ivydell and LaFollette, Tennessee, Pennington Gap near Pennington Gap, Virginia, and Big Stone Gap near Big Stone Gap, Virginia. The crest of Cumberland Mountain ranges from to in elevation. Cumberland Mountain is roughly parallel to Pine Mountain which lies from eight to ten miles to the northwest.

====Geology====
Cumberland Mountain is part of the Cumberland Overthrust Sheet or block and is the northern limb of the Powell Valley Anticline, a ramp anticline. The ridge exists because hard Lee-type sandstones of Early Pennsylvanian Age crop out along this line. Softer rocks have been eroded away, leaving the resistant sandstones to form a ridge. The southwestern terminus of Cumberland Mountain is marked by the northwest-trending Jacksboro Fault, a lateral ramp fault (part of the Pine Mountain Thrust Fault). The northwestern terminus is located near Norton, Virginia, where the hard sandstones dip below the surface as the axis of the Powell Valley anticline plunges to the northeast. The various gaps in Cumberland Mountain are caused by rock weaknesses at cross-cutting faults or joints. For example, Cumberland Gap was caused by erosion along the cross-cutting Rocky Face Fault.

The cliff-lined southeastern slope (escarpment slope) of Cumberland Mountain was created by erosion along the breached side of the Powell Valley Anticline. The more-gentle northwestern slope is the dip slope and roughly parallel to the dip of the Early Pennsylvanian sandstones. This northwestward dip is the northern limb of the Powell Valley Anticline.

Cumberland Mountain forms the drainage divide between the Cumberland River to the north and the Powell River to the south.

===Synclinal mountains===
Several mountains that lie between Pine Mountain and Cumberland Mountain include Black Mountain and Little Black Mountain as well as a number of smaller mountains (Short, Walnut, Rich, Log, Reynolds, etc.). These are all synclinal mountains and reside along the axis of the northeast-trending Middlesboro Syncline. The Pine Mountain ramp forms the northwestern limb of this syncline and Cumberland Mountain (the northwestern limb of the Powell Valley Anticline) forms the southeastern limb.

<text>The M45 SLBM was a French Navy submarine-launched ballistic missile (In French terminology, the MSBS - &quot;Mer-Sol-Ballistique-Stratégique&quot; (Sea-ground-Strategic ballistic missile).)
Forty-eight M45 were in commission in the &quot;Force océanique stratégique&quot;, the submarine nuclear deterrent component of the French Navy.
The missiles, derived from the M4, were produced by Aérospatiale (now Astrium). Initially, an ICBM land-based version was considered, but these plans were discarded in 1996 to favour an all-naval deployment.

The M45 differs from its predecessor by its increased range (6,000 km vs. 4,000 km), its increased accuracy and penetration capabilities and its new TN-75 warheads. Each missile carries six MIRVs, each armed with a thermonuclear warhead of 110 kt. The M45 has a reported accuracy of 350 m CEP using an inertial missile guidance system coupled with computer payload control. It was succeeded by the M51.

The Ministry of Defense had planned to replace the M45 model with the M51 model since 2004, but the last M45 was only removed from service in 2016. However, its successor, the M51 model, was formally introduced in 2010 and has since entered service. Throughout its service, only 64 out of the 192 missiles that were built are believed to have been used.

==Tests==
In March 1986, a M-4 missile was launched and covered 6,000 km to its target; this flight is rumoured to have been the first test flight for the M-45.

On the night of the 1–2 June 2004, the &quot;Vigilant&quot; fired a version of the M45 from the southern part of Brittany; the missile hit its target near French Guiana.

<doc id="666364" wikidata="Q355884" url="?curid=666364" title="Josaphat Kuntsevych">
<text>Josaphat Kuntsevych, OSBM ( – 12 November 1623) was a Basilian hieromonk and archeparch of the Ruthenian Uniate Church who served as Archbishop of Polotsk from 1618 to 1623. On 12 November 1623, he was beaten to death with an axe during an anti-Catholic riot by Eastern Orthodox Belarusians in Vitebsk, in the eastern peripheries of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

His death reflects the conflict between the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches that intensified after four Ruthenian Orthodox Church (Kiev Metropolitanate) bishops transferred their allegiance from the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Constantinople to the Holy See, under the terms laid down by the 1439 Council of Florence, by signing the 1596 Union of Brest. Archeparch Josaphat remains one of the best-known victims of anti-Catholic violence for his role in both personally accepting and very effectively spreading the Eastern Catholic Churches as a hieromonk and bishop, and was canonized in 1867 by Pope Pius IX as a saint and a martyr of the Catholic Church.

In response to the nickname &quot;The Soul-Snatcher&quot;, which Josaphat received from both his Orthodox and Calvinist opponents, his biographer, Fr. Demetrius Wysochansky, has written:&quot;In summing up his pastoral activities which were directed towards the one goal of snatching souls, his contemporaries and witnesses to his life were able to say: &#x27;Whatever Catholics there are in Polotsk, are the fruit of the pastoral labors of Josaphat.&#x27; To this statement one may add that whatever Catholics there have been in Lithuania and Byelorussia in the 350 years since Josaphat&#x27;s death, may all attribute their Catholic Faith to the labors and blood of Josaphat, the &#x27;Soul-Snatcher.&#x27;&quot;

==Biography==

===Historical and religious background===

King Sigismund III Vasa&#x27;s policy for the Counter-Reformation in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was to reunite, &quot;through missions to non-Catholics, both Protestant and Orthodox,&quot; all Christians into the Catholic Church. After preliminary negotiations with Sigismund III and with Grand Chancellor and Great Hetman of the Crown Jan Zamoyski, a delegation of bishops from the Eastern Orthodox was sent to Rome in 1595 to accede to the Union of Brest on condition that their rituals and discipline were left intact. Most Eastern Orthodox bishops within the Commonwealth, including Michael Rohoza, metropolitan of Kiev – but at Vilnius, Vilnius Voivodeship, the capital city of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth – were signatories of the Union of Brest in 1596 which brought the Metropolitanate of Kiev into communion with the pope. Two ecclesiastical factions, those Eastern Orthodox bishops who were signatories and those Eastern Orthodox bishops who were not signatories, met and excommunicated each other, but those who did not assent were in a much worse position than before, because they were no longer officially recognized. The Union resulted in two sectarian groups:

* Ruthenian Orthodox Christians who accepted the Union of Brest became Eastern Catholics and were known as &quot;Uniates&quot;, &quot;()&quot;, a term which, while once widely used and considered benign, is now considered derogatory and insulting. Eastern Catholic Ruthenians were detested, and considered &quot;schismatics and traitors&quot; by those who remained Orthodox and under the Ecumenical Patriarchate.{{rp|page=69}}{{efn|The conflict between the two sectarian groups &quot;has lasted into the 21st century.&quot;{{rp|page=69}}}} &quot;About two-thirds of the Ruthenian population&quot;, however, had become Greek-Catholics by 1620.{{rp|page=88}} The northeastern voivodeships became predominantly &quot;Uniate&quot;.{{rp|page=42}}{{rp|page=42}}
*Eastern Orthodox adherents who did not assent to the Union of Brest articles remained Eastern Orthodox and were known as &quot;{{Interlanguage link|Disuniates|pl|3=dysunici}}&quot;, or &quot;({{langx|pl|dysunici}})&quot;; they were also called &quot;dissidents&quot; by both Roman and Byzantine Catholics.{{rp|page=174}}{{efn|&quot;Greek Orthodox Confession of the Slavonic Rite&quot;.{{rp|page=174}}}} The southeastern voivodeships became predominantly Disuniate.{{rp|page=42}}{{rp|page=42}} Disuniates were subjected to varying degrees of religious discrimination by the Government of the Commonwealth, at the insistence of some Byzantine and Roman Catholic clergy.{{rp|pages=95–97}} The Disuniates were leaderless until a reestablished Eastern Orthodox {{Interlanguage link|Metropolitanate of Kiev (1620–1685)|lt=Metropolitanate of Kiev|uk|3=Київська митрополія (1620—1685)}} was consecrated in 1620, which the government legalized in 1632.

===Early life===
He was born Ioann Kuntsevych in 1580 or 1584 in Volodymyr,{{efn|Volodymyr was granted Magdeburg rights in 1431.}} Volhynian Voivodeship, in the Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown (now in Ukraine). He was baptized into a family associated with the Eastern Orthodox Church.
Although descended from Ruthenian nobility (szlachta, Kuncewicz family), his father had embarked in business, and held the office of town-councilor. Both of Kuntsevych&#x27;s parents encouraged religious participation and Christian piety in the young John. In the school at Volodymyr he gave evidence of unusual talent; he studied Church Slavonic and memorized most of the &quot;Horologion&quot;, which from this period he began to read daily. From this source he drew his early religious education.{{efn|The &quot;flagrant and manifold abuses&quot; in the Eastern Orthodox Church within the Commonwealth, seemed according to Bain, &quot;to justify the necessity of its union with the better-ordered and instructed Roman Church. All contemporary evidence describes its condition in the darkest colours. The bishops, with scarce an exception, were robbers and ruffians; the lesser clergy followed the unedifying example of their ecclesiastical superiors. Konstanty Ostrogski, voivode of Kiev, the chief pillar of the Orthodox church, bitterly complained that the common people hungered in vain for the word of God,&quot; and Smotrytsky &quot;declared that he could not lay his hand on three Orthodox preachers, and that, but for the aid of Catholic postils, there would have been no preaching at all.&quot; An attempt by Jeremias II of Constantinople, in 1588, &quot;to reform these abuses only made matters worse and raised a storm of protest.&quot;{{rp|pages=202–203}}}}

Owing to his parents&#x27; poverty, Kuntsevych was apprenticed to a merchant named Papovič in Vilnius. In Vilnius, divided through the contentions of the various religious sects, he became acquainted with men such as Josyf Veliamyn Rutsky, a former Calvinist who converted to Catholicism and transferred from the Western to the Byzantine Rite. Rutsky supported the recent union with Rome, and under his influence Kuntsevych grew interested in the Catholic Church.

===Monk===
In 1604, in his early 20s, Kuntsevych entered the Monastery of the Trinity (Church and monastery of Holy Trinity) of the Order of Saint Basil the Great in Vilnius, at which time he was given the religious name of Josaphat. Seeking to emulate the Desert Fathers of Roman Egypt, Brother Josaphat repeated the Jesus Prayer so constantly that he was heard to still murmur it during his sleep. He also engaged in many acts of mortification of the flesh, such as praying overnight in the parish cemetery during the winter, while barefoot and deliberately underdressed, in order to offer up his suffering towards the salvation of souls. According the Beatification testimony of his fellow monks, Brother Josaphat regularly prayed while disciplining himself, &quot;Lord, God, grant unity to the Holy Church and the conversion of the Dissidents.&quot;

Stories that the young monk was a Greek Catholic &quot;Starets&quot; spread rapidly and many distinguished people began to visit the Monastery to speak with him for Spiritual direction. Many other young men joined the Monastery, which only recently had been on the verge of closure, due to Brother Josaphat&#x27;s reputation for holiness. Brother Josaphat&#x27;s believed, based on his own studies of history, the liturgical books, and many other sources, that the Union of Brest represented a return to the true roots and origins of the Christian East. He was so successful at arguing in favor of this point and persuading both Orthodox Christians and Ruthenian and Lithuanian Calvinists to convert to Eastern Catholicism, that his theological opponents dubbed him, &quot;The soul-snatcher&quot;.

During his beatification process, Dorotheus Akhrymovych, a Polotsk city councilman who had known Josaphat in Vilna, testified, &quot;Though the parents of the young boys complained publicly and privately about him, calling him the &#x27;Soul-snatcher&#x27; of their sons, later, after their sons returned home from their studies, they were happy with the results and thanked the holy man.&quot;

Father Gennadius Khmelnytsky later testified, &quot;Because of the numerous souls he was converting to God and the numerous boys he was drawing into the religious life from among the townspeople and the nobility, the Dissidents called him &#x27;Soul-snatcher&#x27;, instead of his own name Josaphat. They painted a picture of the Last Judgement which they placed in the vestibule of the Orthodox church, in which Josaphat was depicted as one of the devils who was dragging souls to Hell with a hook. Below the painting were written the words: &#x27;Soul-snatcher.&#x27;&quot;

Whenever Brother Josaphat, however, was called this name, however, he would chuckle and respond, &quot;God grant me the grace to snatch all your souls and lead them to Heaven.&quot;

After a notable life as a layman, Rutsky also joined the Order in 1607.

===Priest and Archbishop===
When Josaphat was ordained to the diaconate, his regular services and labor for the Church had already begun. As a result of his efforts, the number of novices to the Order steadily increased, and under Rutsky – who had meanwhile been ordained a priest – a revival of Eastern Catholic monastic life began among the Ruthenians (Belarusians and Ukrainians). In 1609, after private study under Jesuit Valentin Groza Fabricy, Josaphat was ordained a priest by a Greek Catholic bishop.

Joseph Velamin-Rutski later testified, &quot;He took care of the condemned prisoners to their very last hour, as if there were no one else to do it. After hearing their confessions, he would accompany them to the place of execution, without showing a shadow of reluctance on his face, even if the time were most inopportune, in the evening, for example, or in wintertime. He went gladly as if it were a feast day.&quot;

He subsequently became the hegumen (prior) of several monasteries.

During his Beatification process, Raphael Korsak testified, &quot;Josaphat never neglected to give alms to the poor, to widows, and especially to orphans. Everyone loved him. Whenever he left the Church, everyone pressed towards the Church doors, seeking solace in his words. Hence, when he was elevated from the office of Hegumen to Archbishop of Polotsk, the beggars wept as they bade their protector farewell. His mercy was even more evident when he became Archbishop, so that one could say that his palace was like a market place and trading post for beggars.&quot;

On November 12, 1617, he was consecrated as the coadjutor archeparch for the Archeparchy of Polotsk.{{efn|Polotsk was an important town built at a junction of key trade routes from northern Europe to Constantinople.{{rp|pages=5–6}} It was granted Magdeburg rights in 1498.}} He succeeded as archeparch in March 1618. During his episcopacy, the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Polotsk was rebuilt in 1618–1620.

Kuntsevych faced the daunting task of bringing the local populace to accept union with Rome. He faced stiff opposition from the monks, who feared liturgical Latinisation of the Byzantine Rite as well as from widowed priests who had remarried in open violation of the Eastern Code of Canons. As archeparch he: restored the churches: issued a catechism to the clergy, with instructions that it should be memorized; composed rules for priestly life, and entrusted deacons the task of superintending their observance; assembled synods in various towns in the dioceses; and firmly opposed the Grand Chancellor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Lew Sapieha, who wished to make what Josaphat saw as too many concessions to the Eastern Orthodox at the expense of Greek Catholic faithful.{{Example needed|s|date=December 2018}} Throughout all his strivings and all his occupations, he continued his religious devotion as a monk, and never abated his practice of mortification of the flesh in order to offer up his sufferings for the conversion of others. Through all this he was successful in winning over a large portion of the people.

Discontent increased among the inhabitants of the eastern voivodeships. In 1618 an Orthodox nobleman at Mohilev,{{efn|Mohilev was granted Magdeburg rights by Stephen Báthory in 1577.}} Vitebsk Voivodeship, who had apparently assented to the Union of Brest, openly resisted its implementation and replaced Greek Catholic priests with Disuniate priests. They substituted the names of Timothy II, patriarch of Constantinople, and Osman II, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, in the Divine Liturgy for those of Pope Paul V and Sigismund III.{{efn|Walerian Krasiński believed this demonstrated &quot;what a strong feeling must have existed&quot; against the Tsardom of Russia: when oppressed on account of their religion, they turned to the distant Islamic Ottoman Empire rather than the nearby Eastern Orthodox Tsardom of Russia.{{rp|page=190}}}} The resistance at Mohilev led to a government crackdown against local Orthodox, and a 1619 judicial decree condemned the leaders of the insurrection to death, confiscated all the previously Eastern Orthodox church buildings at Mohilev, and gave them instead to the Ruthenian Catholic Archeparchy of Polotsk.{{rp|pages=190–191}}{{efn|Bohdan Sobol, the father of Spiridon Sobol, was among those executed.}}

Norman Davies alleged in &quot;God&#x27;s Playground&quot; that Josaphat Kuntsevych &quot;was no man of peace, and had been involved in all manner of oppressions, including that most offensive of petty persecutions – the refusal to allow the Orthodox peasants to bury their dead in consecrated ground;&quot;{{rp|pages=174–175}} in other words, he is alleged to have prohibited burial of &quot;Disidents&quot; in Greek Catholic cemeteries.{{rp|page=42}}{{Explain|reason=What were 17th century practices for burial of schismatic Christians? Was it considered a desecration of a cemetery to inter schismatic Christians?|date=December 2014}}

The Ruthenian Orthodox did not disappear, however. In 1620 they assembled in synod at Kiev, protected by Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny, hetman of Zaporizhian Cossacks, and elected new Eastern Orthodox bishops including Meletius Smotrytsky as archbishop-elect of Polotsk, all of whom were consecrated &quot;in great secrecy&quot; at Kiev by Theophanes III, the visiting Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, Neophyte, metropolitan of Sofia, and Avramios, bishop of Stagoi. Thus a rival Orthodox hierarchy was established.{{rp|page=305}}{{rp|page=90}}{{rp|page=191}} In response, King Sigismund III accused Patriarch Theophanes III, with some justification, of being a covert agent working to destabilize the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth on behalf of the Ottoman Empire and ordered his arrest and arrest of all Bishops consecrated by him.{{rp|pages=89–90}}

That changed in 1620, when, with Cossack aid, a rival Eastern Orthodox hierarchy was set up by {{clarify span|text=the Orthodox Church,|explain=By which Orthodox Church?|date=November 2014}}{{Page needed|date=December 2014}} with Smotrytsky (who later himself entered into communion with the see of Rome) being appointed the Orthodox Archeparch of Polotsk.{{Page needed|date=December 2014}} Smotrytsky publicly claimed that Kuntsevych was preparing a {{clarify span|text=total Latinization of the Church and its rituals.|explain=What did Smotrytsky argue against before his conversion from Eastern Orthodox confession to Eastern Catholic confession?|date=November 2014}}{{Failed verification|date=December 2014|reason=He may have done it but it is not in this source.}}

After 1620, according to Orest Subtelny, in &quot;Ukraine&quot;, sectarian violence over ownership of church property increased and &quot;hundreds of clerics on both sides died in confrontations that often took the form of pitched battles.&quot;{{Page needed|date=December 2014}}
The government imposed a settlement on the &quot;unsettling and destructive&quot; conflict in 1632 by legalizing the Disuniate hierarchy and redistributing church property between Uniates and Disuniates.{{Page needed|date=December 2014}}{{efn|Bain noted that, {{Circa|1632}}, the nobles and clergy owned most of the land in the {{clarify span|text=Kingdom;|explain=Does this include all of the Commonwealth or just the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland?|date=December 2014}} the clergy owned 160,000 villages out of a total of 215,000, and paid no taxes at all.{{rp|page=196}}}}

===Death===
 In October 1623 Kuntsevych ordered the arrest of the last priest who was clandestinely holding Orthodox services at Vitebsk, where Kuntsevych had a residence. Enraged at this, some Orthodox townspeople lynched Kuntsevych on 12 November. Witnesses of the event described it as follows:
{{blockquote|The ringing of cathedral bells and the bells of other churches spread. This was the signal and call to insurrection. From all sides of town masses of people – men, women, and children – gathered with stones and attacked the archbishop&#x27;s residence. The masses attacked and injured the servants and assistants of the archbishop, and broke into the room where he was alone. One hit him on the head with a stick, another split it with an axe, and when Kuntsevych fell, they started beating him. They looted his house, dragged his body to the plaza, cursed him – even women and children. ...They dragged him naked through the streets of the city all the way to the hill overlooking the river Dvina. Finally, after tying stones to the dead body, they threw him into the Dvina at its deepest.{{rp|page=121}}|author=|title=|source=}}

John Szlupas wrote, in &quot;The Princeton Theological Review&quot;, that the Lithuanian Protestants were also the secret instigators in the murder of Kuntsevych, and Smotrytsky, the chief agent in the murder, was in constant communication with them.{{rp|pages=263}}

In January 1624, a commission presided over by Sapieha investigated Kuntsevych&#x27;s murder and sentenced 93 people to death for their involvement in the conspiracy,{{rp|pages=57}}{{efn|According to Kempa, 74 of the 93 people sentenced to death were sentenced &quot;in absentia&quot;.{{rp|pages=57}}}} and many were banished and their property confiscated. The townhall and the disuniate churches were destroyed, and the franchises of the city abolished, but restored under the subsequent reign.{{rp|pages=193–194}} With Kuntsevych&#x27;s death the Disuniates were completely broken up in Lithuania, and their leaders were severely punished. The Disuniates lost their churches in Vitebsk, Polotsk, Orsha, Mogilev, and other places. Smotrytsky joined the Uniates in order to escape punishment, and turned his pen against the Disuniates whose weaknesses were not secrets from him.{{rp|pages=263}}
The body was recovered from the river and lay in state in the cathedral of Polatsk. Beatification followed in 1643, but canonization did not take place until 1867, more than two centuries later. The body is now in Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome, placed under the altar of Saint Basil the Great.

In response to the nickname &quot;The Soul-Snatcher&quot;, which Josaphat received from both his Orthodox and Calvinist opponents, his biographer, Fr. Demetrius Wysochansky, has written:&quot;In summing up his pastoral activities which were directed towards the one goal of snatching souls, his contemporaries and witnesses to his life were able to say: &#x27;Whatever Catholics there are in Polotsk, are the fruit of the pastoral labors of Josaphat.&#x27; To this statement one may add that whatever Catholics there have been in Lithuania and Byelorussia in the 350 years since Josaphat&#x27;s death, may all attribute their Catholic Faith to the labors and blood of Josaphat, the &#x27;Soul-Snatcher.&#x27;&quot;

===Hagiography===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
As a boy Kuntsevych was said to have shunned the usual games of childhood, prayed much, and lost no opportunity to assist at the Church services. Children especially regarded him with affection. As an apprentice, he devoted every leisure hour to prayer and study. At first Papovič viewed this behavior with displeasure, but Josaphat gradually won such a position in his esteem that Papovič offered him his entire fortune and his daughter&#x27;s hand. But Josaphat&#x27;s love for the religious life never wavered.

Kuntsevych&#x27;s favourite devotional exercise was the traditional Eastern monastic practice of prostrations, in which the head touches the ground, while saying the Jesus Prayer. Never eating meat, he fasted much, wore a hair shirt and a chain around his waist. He slept on the bare floor, and chastised his body until the blood flowed. The Jesuits frequently urged him to set some bounds to his austerities.

From Kuntsevych&#x27;s zealous study of the Church Slavonic Byzantine Rite liturgical books he drew many proofs of Catholic doctrine and wrote several original works.{{efn|{{cite book|title=On the Baptism of St. Volodymyr}} {{cite book|title=On the Falsification of the Slavic Books by the Enemies of the Metropolitan}} {{cite book|title=On Monks and their Vows}}}} Throughout his adult life, he was distinguished by his extraordinary zeal in performing the Church services and by extraordinary devotion during the Divine Liturgy. Not only in the church did he preach and hear confessions, but likewise in the fields, hospitals, prisons, and even on his personal journeys. This zeal, united with his kindness for the poor, led great numbers of Eastern Orthodox confession Ruthenians to a religious conversion to the Eastern Catholic confession and Catholic unity. Among his converts were many important personages such as deposed Patriarch Ignatius, of Moscow, and {{clarify span|text=Manuel Kantakouzenos, who belonged to the imperial family of the Byzantine Emperor Palaeologus.|explain=Who was this?

After numerous miracles attributed to Kuntsevych were reported to Church officials, Pope Urban VIII appointed a commission, in 1628, to inquire into his possible canonization, which examined 116 witnesses under oath. Josaphat&#x27;s body was claimed to be incorrupt five years after his death. In 1637, a second commission investigated his life and, in 1643, Josaphat was beatified. He was canonized on June 29, 1867, by Pope Pius IX.

The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church celebrates his feast day on November 12. When, in 1867, Pius IX inserted his feast into the General Roman Calendar, it was assigned to November 14, which was the first free day after November 12, which was then occupied by the feast of &quot;Saint Martin I, Pope and Martyr.&quot; In the General Roman Calendar of 1969, this latter feast was moved to Pope Saint Martin&#x27;s {{lang|la|dies natalis}} (&#x27;birthday to heaven&#x27;), and Saint Josaphat&#x27;s feast was moved to that date, his own {{lang|la|dies natalis}}. Some Traditionalist Catholics continue to observe the General Roman Calendar of 1954, the General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII, or the General Roman Calendar of 1960, in which the feast day is on November 14.

Kuntsevych&#x27;s canonization process began in the interval of the January Uprising of 1863–1865 against the Russian Empire and was &quot;understood in many circles, including Polish, Russian, and Ruthenian circles, as a papal gesture of moral support for the insurgent Poles.&quot;{{rp|page=31}} A Russophile Ruthenian newspaper, {{Interlanguage link|Slovo (Ukrainian newspaper)|uk|3=Слово (часопис, 1861)|lt=&quot;Slovo&quot;}}, published several negative articles about Kuntsevych.{{rp|pages=29–30}}{{efn|For example, portions of a 1622 letter from Sapieha to Kuntsevych were published by &quot;Slovo&quot;. According to Himka, &quot;&quot;Slovo&quot; was insinuating by publishing this letter that&quot; Kuntsevych was not a martyr but was murdered &quot;as a natural consequence of his own violent actions.&quot; The canonization was used to &quot;shape and reinforce&quot; the emotional character about &quot;a key Russophile argument&quot; – that an Eastern Catholic Church was not beneficial to Ruthenians.{{rp|pages=29–31}} Krasiński included only an English translation of an extraction from the Sapieha letter.{{rp|pages=192–193}} While {{Interlanguage link|Alphonse Guépin (Benedictine)|fr|3=Alphonse Guépin (bénédictin)|lt=Alphonse Guépin}} included a French translation of the entire Sapieha letter and the entire Kuntsevych response to Sapieha.{{rp|at=pièces justificatives}} Neither letter was included in an abridged Polish translation of Guépin by Walerian Kalinka.}} This antagonism to his canonization &quot;makes sense within the context of the Russophile hegemony in Ruthenian public opinion&quot; and was seen as an insult to Imperial Russia.{{rp|page=31}} The Russian government responded, in 1875, with further Russification and forced conversion of the Eastern Catholic Chełm Eparchy, the last Eastern Catholic eparchy in the Russian Empire.{{rp|page=32}}

===Veneration===
According to &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Saints&quot;, Kuntsevych could be thought of as a patron &quot;of ecumenical endeavour today.&quot;

====Churches====
St. Josaphat Kuntsevych is the patron saint of a number of Polish and Ukrainian churches and parishes in the United States and Canada, including:

* Basilica of St. Josaphat, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin
* St. Josaphat Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral of the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Saint Josaphat in Parma, Ohio.
* St. Josaphat Roman Catholic Church in Chicago, Illinois
* St. Josaphat&#x27;s Parish of Bayside, Queens, New York
* St. Josaphat&#x27;s Ukrainian Catholic Church in Rochester, NY
* St. Josaphat&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church in Detroit
* St. Josaphat Parish in Cheektowaga, New York, in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Buffalo
* St. Josaphat&#x27;s Cathedral and Ukrainian elementary school in Toronto
* St. Josaphat Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral in the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Edmonton, Alberta
*St. Josaphat Ukrainian Catholic Church of Trenton, NJ

In Croatia, he is patron saint of parishes in Rajevo Selo and Sibinj.

====Society of St. Josaphat====
During the 1990s, a group of Byzantine Rite Traditionalist Catholic priests and laity, who had survived the underground Church during the 1947-1987 religious persecution by the Soviet Government and the Russian Orthodox Church, founded the Priestly Society of Saint Josaphat in protest against the allegedly modernistic theology and actions of the UGCC hierarchy which had arrived from the Ukrainian diaspora since the collapse of the Soviet Union. They are closely linked to the Society of St. Pius X, which is critical of both the Second Vatican Council and the Mass of Paul VI.

====Relic====

* There is a relic of the saint in the &quot;catacombs&quot; of Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Church in Chicago.
* There are two relics of Saint Josaphat located in the Basilica of St. Josaphat, in Milwaukee Wisconsin. One is located inside the High Altar and the other is located in the lower Chapel. Vatican documentation is presented in the lower Chapel of the authenticity of the relics.

===Controversy===

Josaphat&#x27;s canonization has been highly controversial among Ukrainian Orthodox population, mostly due to persecution of Orthodox practices incited by Josaphat. These practices include the arrest of Orthodox priests for holding liturgies. Such actions led the Roman Catholic chancellor Lew Sapieha to write a letter to Josaphat in behalf of the King, condemning him for his actions and claiming that his persecution was his own fault.

<text>Bret Davis Schundler (born January 14, 1959) is an American politician from New Jersey who served as the 42nd mayor of Jersey City from 1992 to 2001. He remains the last Republican to hold that office. He also unsuccessfully ran for Governor of New Jersey in 2001 and 2005.

Earlier in his life, Schundler was a Democrat, and the State Coordinator in New Jersey for Gary Hart&#x27;s 1984 campaign for President. He then served as the chief operating officer of The King&#x27;s College, a Christian liberal arts college in New York City. He served in the cabinet of Governor Chris Christie as New Jersey commissioner of education from January to August 2010, when he was dismissed.

==Early life==
Schundler grew up in Woodbridge Township and Westfield, New Jersey as the youngest of nine children. At Westfield High School, he was an All-State football player. He was recruited by Harvard University, where, to help pay for his tuition, he washed dishes, cleaned bathrooms, and worked as a security guard. He graduated with honors in 1981. Schundler&#x27;s ethnic heritage is German and Barbadian.

Following his graduation from college, Schundler worked for Democratic Congressman Roy Dyson of Maryland. He later worked for Gary Hart&#x27;s 1984 presidential campaign. After Hart lost the nomination race, Schundler began his career in finance in the sales department of Salomon Brothers. While he had no experience in the field, his interviewer thought that anyone who could sell Hart in western Iowa had a future in finance. In 1987, he moved to a different firm, C. J. Lawrence, which has since been absorbed into Deutsche Bank, where he did very well financially. He retired in 1990, and after traveling around the world for a year, changed his registration to Republican. He later said that he felt the Democratic Party had been taken captive by special interests.

==Mayor of Jersey City==

His first run for elective office was an unsuccessful campaign for the New Jersey Senate in 1991, where despite the partisan nature of the election, and overwhelmingly Democratic composition of the district (only 6% of voters were registered Republicans), Schundler lost to incumbent Edward T. O&#x27;Connor, Jr. by only a 55.1% to 44.9% margin. The next year, Gerald McCann was removed as mayor of Jersey City because of a criminal conviction unrelated to his public duties, and Schundler entered the special election to finish the remaining eight months of McCann&#x27;s term. He won the election with 17 percent of the vote, in a crowded field of 19 candidates. Like most major cities in New Jersey, Jersey City elections are officially nonpartisan. While Schundler never announced himself as a Republican on his campaign literature or ads, he was known to be a Republican based on his campaign for the State Senate a year earlier, and was thus considered the first Republican to occupy the mayoral office in Jersey City since 1917. Contributing to his victory was the fact that two African American candidates split the black vote, and two siblings, Lou and Allen Manzo, also split a large number of votes.

Once in office, Schundler developed a reputation as a politician who was incorruptible, which strongly resonated in a city with a long legacy of corruption dating to the Frank Hague era in local politics. He subsequently won a full term in 1993 with 69% of the vote—the largest margin of victory since Jersey City returned to the Mayor-Council form of government in 1961, and according to some sources, in the city&#x27;s entire history. He won his second full term in 1997, winning a run-off election by a substantial margin.

During his tenure as mayor, Schundler reduced crime, lowered property taxes, increased the city&#x27;s tax collection rate and property values, instituted medical savings accounts for city employees and privatized the management of the city&#x27;s water utility. He also led the battle to pass New Jersey&#x27;s charter school legislation. 
Moreover, according to a Harvard University study, during his tenure Jersey City led the 100 largest cities in the United States in job growth and poverty reduction. The redevelopment and gentrification of waterfront Jersey City opposite lower Manhattan had begun during 
the McCann era, but it grew markedly during Schundler&#x27;s tenure because of his policies, raising the per capita income in the city.

Schundler attracted considerable national attention because he was the Republican mayor of an overwhelmingly Democratic city. During his tenure, Jersey City remained a Democratic stronghold, as it has been for over a century. Indeed, on the same night as Schundler&#x27;s special election victory, Bill Clinton carried Hudson County (which includes Jersey City) by an overwhelming margin, which was enough to swing New Jersey into the Democratic column for the first time since 1964. Clinton carried Hudson County by an even larger margin in 1996. Additionally, no Republican has represented a significant portion of Jersey City in Congress in over a century, and Schundler was succeeded by a Democrat, Glenn Cunningham, in 2001.

==2001 gubernatorial campaign==

Toward the end of his tenure as mayor, Schundler served as chairman of the Hudson County Republican Committee, and in 2001, he ran for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, facing former Congressman Bob Franks, who was favored by the party establishment. Franks entered the race in April, two months before the primary, after Governor Donald DiFrancesco dropped out of the race because of a series of news stories regarding his alleged unethical behavior. Franks was backed by Governor DiFrancesco&#x27;s political organization, which gave him the endorsement of every county Republican state committee in New Jersey, except, ironically, Schundler&#x27;s very own Hudson County Republican state committee, as well as the Republican committee in Monmouth County, then led by William F. Dowd.

Schundler ran on a conservative platform, which was somewhat unusual, since most New Jersey Republicans tend to be more moderate-to-liberal by national standards. He employed a more grassroots style of campaigning, visiting many local GOP organizations, and forming close relationships with the Young Republicans and College Republicans, as well as conservative issue-based organizations, including those active in homeschooling and other educational issues. This grassroots campaign enabled him to win the nomination by a robust 14% margin.

After winning the primary, Schundler tried to reunite the party by connecting with the leaders who had endorsed Franks. This included a unity lunch with Franks, hosted by former governor Thomas Kean, and retaining State Senator Joseph M. Kyrillos as state party chairman. Kyrillos had been appointed by DiFrancesco as state party chairman just six weeks before the primary, and he had supported Franks in the primary. However, the party remained divided. The Democratic candidate that year, Woodbridge Township Mayor Jim McGreevey (the unsuccessful Democratic candidate in 1997), exploited this division by attacking Schundler as too conservative for the overall state of New Jersey. Schundler made frequent campaign appearances on the late Bob Grant&#x27;s radio show to help bring voters out the polls on election day. Schundler also travelled to Israel, as part of his campaign to court Jewish voters in New Jersey, and while there, the historic September 11 attack on the World Trade Center occurred. The attack caused most air traffic in the U.S. to be shut down for weeks, leaving Schundler stranded in Israel less than one month before the election. In November, Schundler was badly defeated, gaining 42% of the vote to McGreevey&#x27;s 56%. Schundler even lost Hudson County by 50,000 votes, despite his overwhelming electoral success in Jersey City.

Schundler did not run for office again until the 2005 gubernatorial campaign, but remained one of the most visible spokespeople for the more conservative wing of the Republican Party in New Jersey.

Schundler&#x27;s 2005 gubernatorial campaign focused on the issue of property taxes. He proposed a series of state constitutional amendments to control state and local spending in New Jersey, with the savings dedicated to property tax reduction statewide.

As in 2001, Schundler focused mostly on grassroots campaigning. However, he also targeted Republican county conventions to spread his message and won several county endorsements. Besides his base in Hudson County, he also won the endorsement of the Republican Party organizations in Monmouth, Hunterdon, and Somerset counties.

In the week before the primary election, Schundler&#x27;s campaign was criticized for using a photograph on its website that showed Schundler apparently standing with a crowd of enthusiastic young supporters. The photograph, which appeared for only a few days on a web page advertising campaign T-shirts and mugs, had actually been taken at a Howard Dean rally in 2004, with Dean&#x27;s image digitally replaced by Schundler&#x27;s and with campaign signs, hats, and shirts modified as well. Schundler&#x27;s campaign responded that the photograph had been prepared by the campaign&#x27;s website contractor (which had also done work for the Dean campaign), and the campaign removed the picture from the website when it learned of the miscue.

Schundler lost the primary to Doug Forrester, who had been New Jersey&#x27;s Republican nominee for United States Senate in 2002. Forrester&#x27;s considerable wealth enabled him to outspend Schundler during the campaign by about 6-1. The results were:

* Forrester: 35%
* Schundler: 31%
* Morris County Freeholder John J. Murphy: 11%
* Bogota Mayor Steve Lonegan: 8%
* Washington Township Councilman Bob Schroeder: 6%
* Assemblyman Paul DiGaetano: 6%
* Former Bergen County Freeholder Todd Caliguire: 3%

Schundler carried Union, Hudson, Hunterdon and Somerset counties. He had the county line in Somerset and Hudson, and shared it with Forrester in Hunterdon. Forrester held the county line in Union County, which was the only county where he had the line, but still lost in the primary.

== 2009 Jersey City mayoral campaign ==

On August 14, 2008 Schundler confirmed, in a news interview, his intent to run again for the office of Mayor of Jersey City in the 2009 election. Schundler stated that his formal announcement would happen after the 2008 presidential election. He would have faced Mayor Jerramiah Healy, former Assemblyman Louis Manzo (who he had already defeated, in part, in the special election in relatively early 1993), and community activist Dan Levin for the mayor&#x27;s office. State Sen. Sandra Bolden Cunningham, the widow of Schundler&#x27;s successor as mayor, was also considering a race for the mayoralty. Councilman Steven Fulop announced that he would not run for mayor in 2009. On January 12, 2009, Bret Schundler dropped his bid for mayor, citing financial difficulties due in large part to the ongoing financial crash on Wall Street.

== Commissioner of Education ==

On January 13, 2010, Governor-Elect Chris Christie announced that Schundler was his nominee to serve as New Jersey Commissioner of Education. On March 11, the New Jersey Senate approved his nomination by a vote of 35-2. On August 27, 2010, he was dismissed by Governor Christie after an error on a $400 million Race to the Top education grant may have contributed to New Jersey narrowly missing out on the government funding.

== Other activities and family ==

Schundler was a Professor of Public Policy at The King&#x27;s College, a Christian liberal arts college located in the Empire State Building. On January 20, 2009, he was named COO of the college. The King&#x27;s College is accredited in New York, and by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.

Schundler was also Managing Partner of People Power America, LLC, which licenses TeamVolunteer, an online utility that helps political campaigns and non-profit organizations coordinate phone banks. He is currently the principal of School Partners, LLC, a firm that provides consulting to charter schools on everything from facility finance to their education program.

Schundler and his wife, Lynn, have two children, a daughter named Shaylin, and son named Hans Otto III.

<doc id="666378" wikidata="Q1766254" url="?curid=666378" title="Donald's Nephews">
<text>Donald&#x27;s Nephews is a 1938 Donald Duck animated cartoon which features Donald being visited by his three nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie. This cartoon is Huey, Dewey, and Louie&#x27;s first appearance in animation. Al Taliaferro, the artist for the &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; comic strip, proposed the idea for the film, so that the studio would have duck counterparts to Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse, the nephews of Mickey Mouse. The Walt Disney Productions Story Dept. on February 5, 1937, sent Taliaferro a memo recognizing him as the source of the idea for the planned short.

The memo indicated, &quot;we have decided to actually put a story crew to work on &quot;Donald&#x27;s Nephews&quot;&quot;. With the short already in production more than eight months before the boys&#x27; &quot;Donald Duck&quot; comic strip debut (on October 17, 1937), the animation studio&#x27;s model sheet and storyline would have been Taliaferro and writer Ted Osborne&#x27;s frame of reference for the comic strip. Because the strip was an adaptation of the animated shorts, it could utilize ideas from films still in production (&quot;DuckTales&quot; reversed this, being a TV adaptation of the comics). Similarly, Barks&#x27; Junior Woodchuck prototype, &quot;Good Scouts&quot;, was released three months after identical scouting uniforms were introduced by Taliaferro and Bob Karp in the comic strip.

The nephews being triplets who finished each other&#x27;s sentences was developed by Carl Barks, the screenwriter/storyboard artist of the film, for whom &quot;Happy Hooligan&quot;, a comic strip that featured such triplets, was a childhood influence. This characteristic appeared for the first time at the end of the film. The nephews&#x27; names were devised by Disney gag man Dana Coty, who took them from Huey Long, Thomas Dewey, and Louis Schmitt, a Disney Studio animator.

==Plot==
Donald receives a postcard from his sister, Dumbella, which says that her three boys, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, are coming to visit him. At first, Donald is excited to see his nephews, but soon the boys start causing trouble.

Consulting a book called &quot;Modern Child Training&quot;, Donald tries to use the suggestions to gain control over his nephews, but things only get worse. In the end, after the boys leave and with his house left almost destroyed, Donald finds out that the sentence &quot;After all, little children are only angels without wings&quot; is &quot;Phooey!&quot; and tears up the book in an explosive rage.

==Voice cast==
* Clarence Nash: Donald Duck, Huey, Dewey and Louie

==Home media==
The short was released on May 18, 2004, on &quot;Walt Disney Treasures: The Chronological Donald, Volume One: 1934-1941&quot;. It was also released on &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Funny Factory With Huey Dewey &amp; Louie Vol. 4&quot;. It was released to Disney+ on August 11, 2023.

<doc id="666379" wikidata="Q4040766" url="?curid=666379" title="Project Horizon">
<text>Project Horizon was a 1959 study to determine the feasibility of constructing a scientific / military base on the Moon, at a time when the U.S. Department of the Army, Department of the Navy, and Department of the Air Force had total responsibility for U.S. space program plans. On June 8, 1959, a group at the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) produced for the Army a report titled &quot;Project Horizon, A U.S. Army Study for the Establishment of a Lunar Military Outpost&quot;. The project proposal states the requirements as:

The lunar outpost is required to develop and protect potential United States interests on the moon; to develop techniques in moon-based surveillance of the earth and space, in communications relay, and in operations on the surface of the moon; to serve as a base for exploration of the moon, for further exploration into space and for military operations on the moon if required; and to support scientific investigations on the moon.

The permanent outpost was predicted to be required for national security &quot;as soon as possible&quot;, and to cost $6 billion. The projected operational date with twelve soldiers was December 1966.

Horizon never progressed past the feasibility stage, being rejected by President Dwight Eisenhower when primary responsibility for America&#x27;s space program was transferred to the civilian agency NASA.

==Space transportation system==
Horizon was estimated to require 147 early Saturn A-1 rocket launches to loft spacecraft components for assembly in low Earth orbit at a spent-tank space station. A lunar landing-and-return vehicle launched on a Saturn A-2 would have shuttled up to 16 astronauts at a time to the base and back. This was in lieu of a 12 million-pound thrust superbooster required for a direct-ascent lunar flight, which could not possibly be developed in time for the 1966 deployment target. Wernher von Braun, head of ABMA, appointed Heinz-Hermann Koelle to head the Saturn development project team at Redstone Arsenal.

==Location==
Rocket-vehicle energy requirements would have limited the location of the base to an area of 20 deg latitude/longitude on the Moon, from ~20° N, ~20° W to ~20° S, ~20° E. Within this area, the Project selected three particular sites:

* northern part of Sinus Aestuum, near the Eratosthenes crater
* southern part of Sinus Aestuum near Sinus Medii
* southwest coast of Mare Imbrium, just north of the Montes Apenninus mountains

==Proposed Timeline==
*1964: 40 Saturn launches.
*January 1965: Cargo delivery to the Moon would begin.
*April 1965: The first crewed landing by two soldiers. The build-up and construction phase would continue without interruption until the outpost was ready.
*November 1966: Outpost staffed by a task force of 12 soldiers. This program would have required a total of 61 Saturn A-1 and 88 Saturn A-2 launches up to November 1966. During this period the rockets would transport some 220 tonnes of useful cargo to the Moon.

*December 1966 through 1967: First operational year of the lunar outpost, with a total of 64 launches scheduled. These would result in an additional 120 tons of useful cargo.

==Defenses==
The base would be defended against Soviet overland attack by manually fired weapons:

* Unguided Davy Crockett rockets with low-yield nuclear warheads
* Conventional Claymore mines modified to puncture pressure suits

==Layout==
The basic building block for the outpost would be cylindrical metal tanks, in diameter and in length.

Two nuclear reactors would be located in pits for shielding, and would provide power for operation of the preliminary quarters and for the equipment used in the construction of the permanent facility. Empty cargo and propellant containers would be assembled and used for storage of bulk supplies, weapons, and life essentials.

Two types of surface vehicles would be used, one for lifting, digging, and scraping, another for more extended distance trips needed for hauling, reconnaissance and rescue.

A lightweight parabolic antenna erected near the main quarters would provide communications with Earth. At the conclusion of the construction phase the original construction camp quarters would be converted to bio-science and physics-science laboratories.

<text>The Savu Sea (or the Sawu Sea) (, , ) is a small sea within Indonesia named for the island of Savu (Sawu) on its southern boundary. It is bounded by Savu and Raijua to the south, the islands of Rote and Timor (split between East Timor and Indonesia) to the east, Flores and the Alor archipelago to the north/northwest, and the island of Sumba to the west/northwest. Between these islands, it flows into the Indian Ocean to the south and west, the Flores Sea to the north, and the Banda Sea to the northeast.

The Savu Sea reaches about in depth. It spans about 600 km from west to east, and 200 km from north to south. The largest city on the sea is Kupang, the capital of East Nusa Tenggara province on the island of Timor, with about 450,000 inhabitants.

==Extent==
The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) defines the Savu Sea as being one of the waters of the East Indian Archipelago. The IHO defines its limits as follows:

&quot;On the North.&quot; By the Southern limits of Flores Sea [The North coasts of Flores, Komodo, Banta and a line to Tanjong Naroe the Northeast point of Soembawa, thence along its North coast to Tanjong Sarokaja ()] and Banda Sea 125° East ... [on] Alor Island, thence round the East point and along the North coasts of the Alor, Pantar, Lomblen and Adoenara Islands and thence across the Northern end of Flores Stait to Tanjong Serbete the Eastern extreme of Flores].
&quot;On the East.&quot; By the meridian of 125° East between Alor and Timor.

&quot;On the South.&quot; By a line from the Southwest point of Timor to the Northeast point of Roti, through this island to its Southwest point, thence a line to Poeloe Dana () and to Tanjong Ngoendjoe, the Southern extreme of Soemba and through this island to Tanjong Karosso, its Western point.
&quot;On the West.&quot; A line from Tanjong Karosso (Soemba) to Toro Doro () on the South coast of Soembawa.

<doc id="666385" wikidata="Q210751" url="?curid=666385" title="AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon">
<text>The AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) is a glide bomb that resulted from a joint venture between the United States Navy and Air Force to deploy a standardized medium-range precision-guided weapon, especially for engagement of defended targets from outside the range of standard anti-aircraft defenses, thereby increasing aircraft survivability and minimizing friendly losses.
It is intended to be used against soft targets such as parked aircraft, trucks, armored personnel carriers (APCs), and surface-to-air missile sites (SAMs). Prior to launch, it is given a destination through either a predesignated waypoint or a point marked through a targeting pod. It glides, using two wings that pop out for added lift, to the marked destination and dispenses submunitions in a short, roughly linear pattern. The designation of the &quot;Joint Standoff Weapon&quot; as an &quot;air-to-ground missile&quot; is a misnomer, as it is an unpowered bomb with guidance avionics, similar to the older GBU-15.

==Development==
The JSOW is a fire-and-forget weapon that employs a tightly coupled GPS/INS for navigation, and is capable of day/night and adverse weather operations. The JSOW-C adds an infra-red seeker for terminal guidance.

Originally the JSOW was developed by Defense Systems &amp; Electronics division of Texas Instruments. After a first flight, funded by the company in April 1991, a joint program between the US Navy and the US Air Force was awarded. Two other teams had bid on the contract. Texas Instruments sold its defense division to Raytheon in January 1997.

US Navy commenced Operational Evaluation (OPEVAL) in February 1997 and JSOW entered operational service in January 1999.
The Joint Standoff Weapon is currently used by the US Navy. Foreign Military Sales have been signed with Poland and Turkey for use with their F-16 fighters. Finland, Greece and Singapore are pursuing FMS cases at this time. (Finland cleared the FMS procedure and made the purchase for JSOW as well as JASSM and JDAM in 2017.) The JSOW family is a class weapon intended to provide a low cost, highly lethal air-to-surface glide bomb with standoff capabilities from low altitude launch and up to high altitude launch. The JSOW can be used against a variety of land targets and operates from ranges outside enemy point defenses.

The JSOW is just over in length and weighs about . The JSOW was originally to be delivered in three variants, each of which uses a common air vehicle, or truck, while substituting various payloads. The AGM-154A (JSOW-A) entered service in 1999. US Navy and Air Force developed the AGM-154B (JSOW B) up until Multi-Service Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (MOT&amp;E) but the Navy decided not to procure the weapon when the Air Force left the program. The AGM-154C (JSOW BROACH) entered service in February 2005.
During the 1990s, the JSOW was considered to be one of the most successful development programs in DOD history. The system was introduced to operational use a year ahead of schedule. Unlike most guided weapons and aircraft, the system never had a weight management problem, and was deployed at its target weight. The system introduced a new type of fuze, but was able to obtain authority from an independent safety review in record time. Many observers credited these accomplishments to the management style chosen by the DOD and Texas Instruments. After a competitive selection, the program staff was organized into integrated product teams with members from the government, the prime contractor Texas Instruments, and subcontractors. In one case, the prime contractor determined that the best-in-class supplier for a design service was the government, and gave part of its funding back. JSOW was recognized in 1996 with a Laurels Award from Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology. It is notable for a guided weapon to receive this award, which is normally reserved for much larger systems. Because of this history, JSOW has been used as a case study for development programs, and for Integrated Product Teams, and is sometimes cited in academic research on program management.

==Variants==
===AGM-154A (baseline JSOW)===
The warhead of the AGM-154A consists of 145 BLU-97/B Combined Effects Bomb (CEB) submunitions. These bomblets have a shaped charge for armor defeating capability, a fragmenting case for material destruction, and a zirconium ring for incendiary effects.

===AGM-154B (anti-armor)===
The warhead for the AGM-154B is the BLU-108/B from the Air Force&#x27;s Sensor Fuzed Weapon (SFW) program. The JSOW B was to carry six BLU-108/B submunitions. Each submunition releases four projectiles (total of 24 per weapon) that use infrared sensors to detect targets. When a submunition detects that it is aligned with a target, it fires, creating an explosively formed penetrator capable of defeating vehicle armor. This program concluded development but the Navy decided not to procure the weapon.

===AGM-154C (unitary variant)===
The AGM-154C uses an Imaging Infrared (IIR) terminal seeker with autonomous guidance. The AGM-154C carries the BROACH warhead. This two stage 225 kg (500 lb) warhead is made up from a WDU-44 shaped augmenting warhead and a WDU-45 follow through bomb. The weapon is designed to attack hardened targets. It entered service with the US Navy in February 2005.

==Production and upgrades==
Full rate production started on December 29, 1999. In June 2000, Raytheon was contracted to develop an enhanced electronics package for the JSOW to prevent electronic spoofing of GPS signals. This ultimately resulted in the JSOW Block II weapon, incorporating multiple cost reduction initiatives in addition to the Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) capability. JSOW Block II was scheduled to begin production in March 2007.

The JSOW contains a modular control and deployment interface that allows future enhancement and additional configurations since it is likely that additional variants will emerge. The basic airframe is advertised as a &quot;truck&quot; and the JSOW-as-a-truck capability is widely advertised. Raytheon has placed a tremendous investment in the JSOW program and will certainly try to extend the Department of Defense contracts for as long as possible with system upgrades and repackagings for new missions and targets.

===JSOW Block III (JSOW-C1)===
The AGM-154C-1 was scheduled to begin production in 2009. The first three launches were conducted in August 2011 from an F/A-18F. The JSOW-C1 completed integrated test and evaluations in January 2015, moving on to operational tests. The C1 version is slated for delivery in 2016. It achieved Initial Operating Capability (IOC) on 22 June 2016. On 11 October 2017 the Department of the Navy declared the Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) C-1 ready for full operational capability.

===AGM-154A-1 (JSOW-A1)===
In addition, the AGM-154A-1 configuration is under development by Raytheon for FMS sales. This version replaces the submunition payload of the AGM-154A with a BLU-111 warhead to enhance blast-fragmentation effects without the unexploded ordnance (UXO) concerns with the BLU-97/B payload.

===Powered JSOW (JSOW-ER)===
A Pratt &amp; Whitney TJ-150 turbojet engine for a powered JSOW is being tested. This variant is named JSOW-ER, where &quot;ER&quot; is for &quot;extended range&quot;. JSOW-ER will increase range from . In February, 2019, the US Navy announced that it would issue a sole-source contract to Raytheon to build an improved JSOW-ER to be placed in service by the end of FY2023.

The US Navy eventually scrapped plans to develop the JSOW-ER in its FY2022 budget, instead opting to procure a variant of Lockheed Martin&#x27;s AGM-158B Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile Extended Range (JASSM-ER) cruise missile to meet both its strike and offensive anti-surface warfare (OASuW) requirements. It is also expected to leverage technology from the AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), itself a JASSM-ER derivative.

==Combat history==
The AGM-154A was the first variant to be used in combat. The AGM-154A is usually used for Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses missions. Initial deployment testing occurred aboard and later aboard the USS &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot;. The first combat deployment of the JSOW occurred over southern Iraq on December 17, 1998, when launched by a single F/A-18C from the &quot;Checkerboards&quot; of VMFA-312, Carrier Air Wing Three embarked aboard USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; during Operation Desert Fox. The glide range of the JSOW allowed the weapon to strike a target located in the southern suburbs of Baghdad. This weapon has enjoyed success since its early use. One adverse event occurred in February 2001, when a strike of F/A-18s from the USS &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; battle group launched a massive attack on Iraqi air-defense sites, nearly every weapon missed the target. The cause of the miss was reported as a software problem. This problem was solved soon afterward. Since 1998, at least 400 of the JSOW weapons have been used in the following conflicts: Operation Desert Fox, Operation Southern Watch, NATO Operation Allied Force, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation Iraqi Freedom.

<text>Bi Sheng (972–1051) was a Chinese artisan and engineer during the Song dynasty (960–1279), who invented the world&#x27;s first movable type. Bi&#x27;s system used fired clay tiles, one for each Chinese character, and was invented between 1039 and 1048. Printing was one of the Four Great Inventions. Because Bi was a commoner, not an educated person, little is known about his life besides this invention.

== Movable type printing ==
Bi Sheng&#x27;s invention was only recorded in the &quot;Dream Pool Essays&quot; by Chinese scholar-official and polymath Shen Kuo (1031–1095). The book provides a detailed description of the technical details of Bi Sheng&#x27;s invention of movable type printing:

During the next several centuries, movable type was seldom mentioned or described. Wooden movable-type printing became widespread in the Qing dynasty (1644–1912), but did not replace block printing, probably because of the expense of creating a font of so many pieces or the low cost of a copyist. The government official Wang Zhen () improved Bi Sheng&#x27;s clay types by innovation through the wood, as his process increased the speed of typesetting as well. By 1490, bronze movable type was developed by the wealthy printer Hua Sui (1439–1513).

== Legacy ==
Bisheng Subdistrict () in Wenquan, Huanggang, Hubei is named for Bi Sheng. The Bi Sheng crater located in the LAC-7 quadrant near the northern pole on the far side of the Moon was named after Bi Sheng by the IAU in August 2010.

He also appears in a commemorative stamp by the Liberian post office due to his invention of movable printing.

=== First Kuomintang-Communist War ===
In 1927, following the collapse of Kuomintang-Communist collaboration and the KMT&#x27;s systematic extermination of communists, Wang Zhen traversed Changsha and Wuhan, advocating for participation in the workers&#x27; movement, clandestine logistics, and military operations. In 1929, he contributed to the establishment of the revolutionary stronghold in Hunan-Jiangxi Border, subsequently holding various positions, including political commissar of the Red Army&#x27;s First Independent Division of Xiangdong, secretary of the Party Committee of the Division, political commissar of a division within the Red Eighth Army, chief of the Political Department of the Army, and acting commander of the .

He subsequently participated in leading the fights of Chenjiahe, Taozixi, Zhongbao, Banliyuan, among others, while also establishing, strengthening, and solidifying the revolutionary bases of Hunan-Anhui-Sichuan-Guizhou.

In November 1935, when the Kuomintang intensified its encirclement strategy, the Second and Sixth Red Army Corps proactively commenced the Long March. In early July 1936, they encountered the Fourth Red Army in the Garzê region, Sichuan. Subsequently, the Second and Sixth Red Army Corps, along with the Red 32nd Army, established the (). Wang Zhen, together with Ren Bishi, He Long, and Guan Xiangying, staunchly opposed and resisted Zhang Guotao&#x27;s division of the Red Army and the Communist Party, and diligently implemented the Party Central Committee&#x27;s directive to advance northward to combat the Japanese. In October 1936, he arrived in Huining County, Gansu with the Second Red Army, effectively achieving the division of the three principal units of the Red Army.

=== Second Sino-Japanese War ===

He commanded his forces at the anti-Japanese front in Shanxi, starting in February 1938, successfully recaptured seven counties, including Ningwu, to establish an anti-Japanese regime and a base in northwestern Shanxi. Subsequently, he sent his forces to penetrate the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, establishing the anti-Japanese stronghold of Yanbei, situated on Hengshan Mountain. From early 1939 to August, he commanded the 359th Brigade to fight against the Japanese forces in Shanxi. During the confrontation at Xinshuzui, the Japanese executed gas bomb assault; however, they were unable to thwart the advance of the 359th Brigade.

In August 1939, to safeguard the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, Wang Zhen was instructed to take his forces back to northern Shaanxi, specifically to Suide, Mizhi, and other locations, where he assumed the roles of Suide Police Reserve District Commander and political commissar. During World War II when the communist base in northwestern China was blockaded by Kuomintang forces under the command of Hu Zongnan, Wang Zhen gained fame as the brigade commander of the 359th Brigade for successfully converting waste land in into productive farm land, and the agricultural output not only supported the brigade itself, but also with a substantial surplus to support other parts of the communist base. The success was later lauded by the communists as an example of self-sufficiency. In 1942, he held the positions of secretary of the CPC Yan&#x27;an Committee, commander of the Yan&#x27;an military sub-district, garrison commander, and oversaw the mass production movement.
In October 1944, the Japanese forces defeated the Kuomintang army in Operation Ichi-Go.

In June 1945, the army continued to advance southward, and when it reached the central part of Hunan, the Japanese surrendered, allowing Chiang Kai-shek to mobilize Xue Yue&#x27;s forces to besiege this lone communist army. Upon reaching the Nanxiong region of Guangdong, Wang Zhen&#x27;s initial strategy to meet the Dongjiang Column was disrupted, necessitating his return north to coordinate with the 5th Division of the New Fourth Army and Wang Shusheng&#x27;s troops in the Henan Military Region, where he concurrently held the positions of deputy commander and chief of staff of the Central Plains Military Region. During his mission, Wang Zhen was elected as an alternate member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party at the 7th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party.

The forces were encircled by ten combined divisions of Hu Zongnan and Liu Zhi at the border of Henan and Shaanxi, subsequently executing many breakouts. In September 1946, the 359 Brigade returned to northern Shaanxi, having traversed almost 20,000 miles, an expedition referred to by Mao Zedong as the “Second Long March.” Subsequently, Wang Zhen traveled to Lüliang for rest and recuperation, assuming the roles of commander and political commissar of the second column of the .

<text>In crystallography, the triclinic (or anorthic) crystal system is one of the seven crystal systems. A crystal system is described by three basis vectors. In the triclinic system, the crystal is described by vectors of unequal length, as in the orthorhombic system. In addition, the angles between these vectors must all be different and may not include 90°.

The triclinic lattice is the least symmetric of the 14 three-dimensional Bravais lattices. It has (itself) the minimum symmetry all lattices have: points of inversion at each lattice point and at 7 more points for each lattice point: at the midpoints of the edges and the faces, and at the center points. It is the only lattice type that itself has no mirror planes.

==Crystal classes==

The triclinic crystal system class names, examples, Schönflies notation, Hermann-Mauguin notation, point groups, International Tables for Crystallography space group number, orbifold, type, and space groups are listed in the table below. There are a total of 2 space groups.

With each only one space group is associated. Pinacoidal is also known as triclinic normal. Pedial is also triclinic hemihedral.

Mineral examples include plagioclase, microcline, rhodonite, turquoise, wollastonite and amblygonite, all in triclinic normal ().

<doc id="666407" wikidata="Q3637977" url="?curid=666407" title="Bench trial">
<text>A bench trial is a trial by judge, as opposed to a jury. The term applies most appropriately to any administrative hearing in relation to a summary offense to distinguish the type of trial. Many legal systems (Roman, Islamic) use bench trials for most or all cases or for certain types of cases.

As a jury renders a verdict, in a bench trial, a judge does the same by making a finding.

==United Kingdom==
===England and Wales===
Most civil trials proceed without a jury and are heard by a judge sitting alone.

Summary criminal trials may be heard by a single district judge (magistrates&#x27; court) or by a panel of at least two, but more usually three, magistrates.

Section 47 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 allows a bench trial for indictable offences, but is rarely used, having been exercised only two times since its inception.

===Scotland===

Most civil trials in Scotland are conducted in a sheriff court by a sheriff sitting alone. In the Court of Session, a judge in either the outer or inner house usually sits alone; but may sit with a jury in certain trials such as personal injury claims.

Summary criminal trials are conducted by a sheriff in a sheriff court or a justice of the peace in the justice of the peace court sitting alone as regulated by the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995. Those trials requiring juries are called solemn procedure and are also regulated under the Act.

==Turks and Caicos==
One of the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry 2008–2009 in Turks and Caicos was that provisions be made for criminal trials without juries, following the precedent in England and Wales. Other examples cited included the United States, the Commonwealth of Nations including India and Canada, the British overseas territories of the Falkland Islands and St. Helena, and the Netherlands.

In United States law, for most criminal cases that proceed to trial, trial by jury is usually a matter of course as it is a constitutional right under the Sixth Amendment and cannot be waived without certain requirements. In the federal court system, under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, if a defendant is entitled to a jury trial, the trial must be by jury unless the defendant waives a jury trial in writing. In the various state court systems, waiver of jury trial can vary by jurisdiction. Missouri has Missouri Supreme Court Rule 27.01(b), &quot;The defendant may, with the assent of the court, waive a trial by jury and submit the trial of any criminal case to the court...&quot;; the prosecution needs not consent.

With bench trials, the judge plays the role of the jury as finder of fact in addition to making conclusions of law. In some bench trials, both sides have already stipulated to all the facts in the case (such as civil disobedience cases designed to test the constitutionality of a law). Because of needing fewer formalities, these cases are usually faster than jury trials. For example, there is no jury selection phase and no need for sequestration or jury instructions.

A bench trial (whether criminal or civil) that is presided over by a judge has some distinctive characteristics, but it is similar to a jury trial. For example, the rules of evidence and methods of objection are the same in a bench trial as in a jury trial. Bench trials, however, are frequently less formal than jury trials. It is often less necessary to protect the record with objections, and sometimes evidence is accepted &quot;de bene&quot; or provisionally, subject to the possibility of being struck in the future.

==Israel==
In Israel all cases are heard before a judge or a panel of judges.

== India ==
All trials in India since 1973 are heard by a judge or a division bench of judges. The main reason for the abolishment of jury trial in India was due to a popular case K.M Nanavati vs State of Maharashtra in which jury gave a verdict of not guilty even when all the evidence were present against the accused, resulting in a jury nullification.

==Civil law==
In most countries with &quot;Roman law&quot; or civil law, there is no &quot;jury&quot; in the English sense, and trials are necessarily bench trials. However, in more complicated cases, lay judges can be called. They are not randomly selected, as juries are. They are professional, although not legally trained as jurists, and vote as judges. One notable exception, from French law, is cour d&#x27;assises, where jurors are allotted and vote alongside professional judges. Jury trials took place till 1973 when they were finally abolished by the 1973 Code of Criminal Procedure, recommended by the law commission of India in their 14th report in 1958.

<text>The Coney I-Lander restaurants are a regional chain based in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Their signature dish is a small slow-grilled hot dog topped with chili, onions, and mustard, sitting in a steamed bun. The restaurants also serve small tamales, and spaghetti topped with the same chili used on the coneys. The name of the restaurant is derived from Coney Island, the early-1900s amusement park and vacation destination in New York City.

The chain dates to 1926, when Greek immigrant Christ Economou opened his first location in downtown Tulsa. The restaurant was one of the first to sell chili and was named &quot;Coney Island in Tulsa&quot; until 1983, a year in which the eateries sold more than 600,000 hot dogs. At the downtown restaurant rows of &quot;coneys&quot; on the grill are visible to those standing outside on the sidewalk. Antique school desks are used as seating at the original downtown location, a tradition started by the founder, who believed they offered each customer a personal space.

An oral history of the restaurant was given to Voices of Oklahoma in 2011 by the founder&#x27;s son, Jim Economou.

<text>A point target is:

# A target of such small dimension that it requires the accurate placement of ordnance in order to neutralize or destroy it.
# A nuclear target in which the ratio of radius of damage to target radius is equal to or greater than 5.
# A radar target that is small compared with the pulse volume, which is the cross-sectional area of the radar beam multiplied by half the length of the radar pulse. 

Targets such as city buildings, and targets in the midst of many non-targets are considered to be point targets. When attacking point targets, weapons with only the necessary amount of spread and power are employed. 

Point targets are often located near other buildings which contain civilians and other innocents, therefore guided munitions are used to take out only the intended target. A strike executing in this manner is often referred to as a surgical strike.

<text>Mr. Duck Steps Out is a Donald Duck cartoon produced by Walt Disney Productions, which is released on June 7, 1940, and featured the debut of Daisy Duck. The short was directed by Jack King and written by Carl Barks, Chuck Couch, Jack Hannah, Harry Reeves, Milt Schaffer, and Frank Tashlin.

Clarence Nash performs all the voices in the film—Donald, Daisy and Donald&#x27;s nephews.

==Plot==
Donald prepares to visit his new love interest, Daisy, for their first known date. Huey, Dewey, and Louie attempt to go too, but Donald, unwilling to allow this, tricks them into entering a closet and locks them in before heading to Daisy&#x27;s house, but the nephews escape by sawing a hole in the wall and beat him there. After Donald unknowingly gives a box of chocolates (which are meant to Daisy) to the nephews, he realizes who he&#x27;s talking to after hearing them thank him and chases them down, cornering them just as Daisy arrives. Being forced to act nicely, he claims that he brought his nephews along before quickly taking the chocolates back and in exchange, gives the nephews a coin and sends them to buy ice cream. They do so, rushing out of the house so fast that it causes the door to briefly slam shut. Now alone, Donald and Daisy sit on a couch. Donald tries to woo her and hug her, but at first Daisy acts shy and has her back turned to her visitor. Donald soon notices her tail feathers taking the form of a hand and signaling for him to come closer, but their time alone is soon interrupted by the nephews, who have just returned; they push Donald off the couch and he bumps into a radio, causing it to play music.

Donald and the nephews take turns dancing the jitterbug with her while trying to get rid of each other. One of the nephews, cleverly switches his ice cream for Daisy, but Donald soon takes notice and in a fit of rage, throws the ice cream on the floor, making it splatter in his face. He pulls the nephew aside and dances with Daisy again, but all three nephews then knock Donald aside, causing him to fall into a tiger skin rug, which Donald uses to fling the nephews into the kitchen. In their final effort, the three younger ducks find a maize and after heating it on the stove, knock it into Donald&#x27;s mouth as it is in the process of becoming popcorn. The process is completed within Donald himself, who continues to move wildly around the house while maintaining the appearance of dancing. The nephews then bring things into the room to use as instruments: a trombone, plungers, a dummy, a candelabra, a frog-shaped flower holder, a piano, a horn, and many objects that are used as drums. After landing near a fireplace, the maize that&#x27;s still in Donald&#x27;s stomach makes him go out of control, resulting in Daisy being tangled in curtains, her and Donald spinning on a rug, followed by them crashing through a foldable wall. The camera then moves to show that they&#x27;ve crashed into a dish cabinet. The short ends with an impressed Daisy showering her new lover with red kisses.

==History==
&quot;Mr. Duck Steps Out&quot; stands out among other Donald shorts of the period for its use of modern music and surreal situations throughout. After this short, the idea of a permanent love interest for Donald was well established, but Daisy did not appear as regularly as Donald himself.

Virginia Davis, who years earlier worked with Walt as the titular character in the &quot;Alice Comedies&quot;, served as the dance model for Daisy.

In later versions of this short, Daisy&#x27;s lines were re-dubbed by June Foray.

<doc id="666420" wikidata="Q179774" url="?curid=666420" title="Sahaja Yoga">
<text>Sahaja Yoga (सहज योग) is a new religious movement founded in 1970 by Nirmala Srivastava (1923–2011). Nirmala Srivastava is known as Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi (trans: &quot;Revered Immaculate Mother&quot;) or simply as &quot;Mother&quot; by her followers, who are called Sahaja yogis.

Practitioners believe that during meditation they experience a state of self-realization produced by kundalini awakening, and that this is accompanied by the experience of thoughtless awareness or mental silence.

Shri Mataji described Sahaja Yoga as the pure, universal religion integrating all other religions. She claimed that she was a divine incarnation, more precisely an incarnation of the Holy Spirit, or the Adi Shakti of the Hindu tradition, the great mother goddess who had come to save humanity. This is also how she is regarded by most of her devotees. Sahaja Yoga has sometimes been characterized as a cult.

== Etymology ==
The word &#x27;Sahaja&#x27; in Sanskrit has two components: &#x27;Saha&#x27; is &#x27;with&#x27; and &#x27;ja&#x27; is &#x27;born&#x27;. &quot;A Dictionary of Buddhism&quot; gives the literal translation of Sahaja as &quot;innate&quot; and defines it as &quot;denoting the natural presence of enlightenment (bodhi) or purity&quot;, and Yoga means &quot;union&quot; &quot;with the divine&quot; and refers to a spiritual path or a state of spiritual absorption. According to a book published by Sahaja Yogis, Sahaja Yoga means &quot;spontaneous&quot; and &quot;born with you&quot; meaning that the kundalini is born within us and can be awakened spontaneously, without effort.

The term &#x27;Sahaja Yoga&#x27; goes back at least to the 15th Century Indian mystic Kabir and has also been used to refer to Surat Shabd Yoga. Sahaja can also mean &#x27;comfortable&#x27;, &#x27;natural&#x27;, or &#x27;uncomplicated&#x27; in Hindi.

== History ==
Before starting Sahaja Yoga, Srivastava had a reputation as a spiritual healer. In 1970, with a small group of devotees around her, she began spreading her message of Sahaja Yoga in India. As she moved with her husband to London, UK, she continued her religious activities there, and the movement grew and spread throughout Europe, by the mid-80&#x27;s reaching North America. In 1989, Shri Mataji made her first trip to Russia and Eastern Europe. She did not charge for her classes, insisting that her lesson was a birthright which should be freely available to all. As of 2021, Sahaja Yoga has centers in at least 69 countries.

== Beliefs and practices==
The movement claims Sahaja Yoga is different from other yoga/meditations because it begins with self realization through kundalini awakening rather than as a result of performing kriya techniques or asanas. This self realization is said to be made possible by the presence of Srivastava often through a photograph of her. The teachings, practices and beliefs of Sahaja Yoga are mainly Hindu-based, with a predominance of elements from mystical traditions, as well as local customs of India. There are however elements of Christian origin, such as the eternal battle between good and evil. References to a variety of other religious, spiritual, mystical as well as modern scientific frameworks are also interwoven in Srivastava&#x27;s teachings, although to a lesser degree.

Religious sociologist Judith Coney has reported facing a challenge in getting behind what she called &quot;the public facade&quot; of Sahaja Yoga. She described Sahaja yogis as adopting a low profile with uncommitted individuals to avoid unnecessary conflict.

Coney observed that the movement tolerates a variety of world views and levels of commitment with some practitioners choosing to remain on the periphery.

=== Kundalini ===

Within the Indian mystic tradition, kundalini awakening has long been a much sought-after goal that was thought rare and hard to attain. Sahaja Yoga is distinctive in claiming to offer a quick and easy path to such an awakening.

=== Meditation ===
Meditation is one of the foundational rituals within Sahaja Yoga. The technique taught emphasises the state of &quot;thoughtless-awareness&quot; that is said to be achieved.

=== Role of women ===
Judith Coney has written that in general, Nirmala Srivastava&#x27;s vision for the role of women within Sahaja Yoga was one of &quot;feminine domesticity and compliance&quot;.

Some parents of Sahaja &#x27;yogists&#x27;, analyzing Nirmala Srivastava&#x27;s remarks, noted that women play a subordinate role. The texts of Nirmala Srivastava say that &quot;if you are a woman and you want to dominate, then Sahaja Yoga will have difficulty in curing you&quot; and that women should be &quot;docile&quot; and &quot;domestic&quot;. Judith Coney writes that women &quot;are valued as mothers and wives but are limited to these roles and are not encouraged to be active or powerful, except within the domestic sphere and behind the scenes&quot;.

Coney has observed that &quot;Gender roles for women and men within Sahaja Yoga are clearly specified and highly segregated, and positions of authority in the group are held almost exclusively by the men&quot;. Coney writes that the ideal of womanhood promoted within Sahaja Yoga draws both on the ideal wifely qualities of the goddess Lakshmi and on wider Hindu traditions. Coney believes these traditions are summed up in &quot;The Code of Manu&quot; which holds that woman should be honoured and adorned but kept dependent on men in the family. Women are also described in this book as &quot;dangerous&quot; and needing to be guarded from temptation.

Coney has written that Nirmala Srivastava did not display consistent views on women but gave a number of messages about the status of women. On the one hand she said women are not inferior but described the sexes as complementary. Describing the man as the head of the family, she likened the woman&#x27;s status to the heart: &quot;The head always feels he decides, but the brain always knows that is the heart one has to cater, it is the heart which is all-pervading, it is the real source of everything&quot;. She regretted what she saw as the loss of respect for women in society in both the East and West. However, she viewed Western feminism suspiciously, seeing it as a &quot;route to damnation&quot; because it required women to deviate from what she thought was their true nature.

=== Family ===
Human rights lawyer Sylvie Langlaude has described the configuration of families within Sahaja Yoga as having &quot;a distinctive image and model of childhood&quot;, noting that from birth children become familiarised with the movement&#x27;s beliefs and Nirmala Srivastava&#x27;s status by being closely involved in its day-to-day rituals including meditation, foot-soaking, and devotional singing. This is in line with the other religions Langlaude examined, who concluded that &quot;almost all traditions include informal nurturing within the family and slightly more formal nurturing within a religious community&quot;, and that children &quot;are also initiated by their parents to a number of initiation rituals and to ceremonies and festivals.&quot;

=== The subtle system – chakras and nadis ===
Sahaja Yoga believes that in addition to our physical body there is a subtle body composed of nadis (channels) and chakras (energy centres). Nirmala Srivastava equates the Sushumna nadi with the parasympathetic nervous system, the Ida nadi with the left and the Pingala nadi with the right sides of the sympathetic nervous system. Psychoanalyst Sudhir Kakar writes that Nirmala Srivastava&#x27;s additions to this widespread traditional &#x27;tantric&#x27; model include giving it a scientific, neurological veneer, an elaboration of the health aspects and an introduction of notions of traditional Christian morality.

Chakras do not physically exist but in a variety of ancient meditation practices they are believed to be part of the subtle body.

=== Apostasy ===
In common with similar movements, most people who have left the Sahaja Yoga movement do not describe their experience as being unremittingly negative, often finding something positive they can say. Nevertheless, in interviews with ex-members Judith Coney heard various complaints, including that they had experienced unwanted arranged marriage, had been dismayed by the difference between the reality of the movement and what they had expected, and had found their time in the movement frightening.

The ex-members who believed they had gained some form of supernatural protection from being in the movement were generally fearful of being exposed to retribution for having left, perhaps in the form of a terminal illness or fatal accident.

=== Eschatology ===
Within the Sahaja Yoga belief system, because we are in the final phase of the world (Kali Yuga) before the apocalypse, the Earth is rich in demons, who use satanic forces to possess people, impersonate gurus, and spread evil.

Judith Coney writes that Nirmala Srivastava claimed to be Adi Shakti, who had returned to earth to save it from &quot;demonic influences.&quot;

Coney writes that Nirmala Srivastava identified what she saw as increased decadence in society as the work of demons &quot;intent on dragging human beings to hell&quot;.

== Organization ==
Vishwa Nirmala Dharma (trans: Universal Pure Religion, also known as Sahaja Yoga International) is the organizational part of the movement. It is a registered organization in countries such as Colombia, the United States of America, and Austria. It is registered as a religion in Spain. 

=== Membership statistics ===
There are no available statistical data about Sahaja Yoga membership. In 2001, the number of core members worldwide was estimated to be 10,000, in addition to 100,000 practitioners more or less in the periphery. There are varying reports about the movement&#x27;s distribution worldwide. According to the Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi Sahaja Yoga World Foundation, Sahaja Yoga centers are established in over 140 countries. In a news article in Indian Express published on the occasion of Srivastava&#x27;s death in 2011, however, Sahaja Yoga centers were said to exist in 140 countries.

=== International Sahaja Public School===

The International Sahaja Public School in Dharamsala founded in 1990, teaches around 250 international students annually , and has accepted children from the age of 6.

=== Yuvashakti ===
Sahaja Yoga&#x27;s youth movement is called &quot;Yuvashakti&quot; (also &quot;Nirmal Shakti Yuva Sangha&quot;), from the Sanskrit words Yuva (Youth) and Shakti (Power).

The movement is active in forums such as the World Youth Conference and TakingITGlobal which aim at discussing global issues, and ways of solving them.

The Yuvashakti participated in the 2000 &quot;Civil Society &amp; Governance Project&quot; in which they were &quot;instrumental in reaching out to women from the poor communities and providing them with work&quot;.

=== Vishwa Nirmal Prem Ashram ===
The &quot;Vishwa Nirmala Prem Ashram&quot; is a not-for profit project by the NGO Vishwa Nirmala Dharma (Sahaja Yoga International) located in Noida, Delhi, India, opened in 2003. The ashram is a &quot;facility where women and girls are rehabilitated by being taught meditation and other skills that help them overcome trauma&quot;.

=== Funding ===
According to the dictates of their founder, the methods for practicing Sahaja Yoga are made available free of charge to those interested. Nevertheless, according to the official Sahaja Yoga website there is a fee for attending international pujas to cover costs.

According to author David V. Barrett, &quot;Shri Mataji neither charged for her lectures nor for her ability to give Self Realization, nor does one have to become a member of this organization. She insisted that one cannot pay for enlightenment and she continued to denounce the false self-proclaimed &#x27;gurus&#x27; who are more interested in the seekers&#x27; purse than their spiritual ascent&quot;.
== Cult classification ==
Cult expert Jean-Marie Abgrall has written that Sahaja Yoga exhibits the classic characteristics of a cult in the way it conditions its members. These include having a god-like leader, disrupting existing relationships, and promising security and specific benefits while demanding loyalty and financial support. Abgrall writes that the true activities of the cult are hidden behind the projection of a positive image and an explicit statement that &quot;Sahaja yoga is not a cult&quot;.

Judith Coney has written that members &quot;disguised some of their beliefs&quot; from non-members. Coney writes people who had left the movement welcomed the chance to talk to her as an independent researcher, but that some were fearful of reprisals if they did so, and others found their experiences too painful to revisit. Most were unwilling to talk to her &quot;on the record&quot;.

An &quot;A-Z of cults&quot; in &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that adherents of Sahaja Yoga found a cult designation &quot;particularly offensive&quot; but that the movement had been plagued by accounts of children being separated from their parents and of large financial donations made to Nirmala Srivastava.

In 2001, &quot;The Independent&quot; reported the allegation made by some ex-members, that Sahaja Yoga is a cult which aims to control the minds of its members. Ex-members said that the organisation insists all family ties are broken and all communication with them cease, that crying children can be seen as being possessed by demons, that negative and positive vibrations need &quot;clearing&quot;, and that being a member of the group is very expensive. In 2005, &quot;The Record&quot; reported that some critics who feel that the group is a cult have started their own websites.

In 2005 the Belgian State organisation IACSSO (Informatie- en Adviescentrum inzake de Schadelijke Sektarische Organisaties) issued an advisory against Sahaja Yoga. The advisory categorizes Sahaja Yoga as a synretic cult (&quot;syncretische cultus&quot;) based on the Hindu tradition, and warns that the recruitment techniques used by Sahaja Yoga pose a risk to the public in general and young people in particular. Sahaja Yoga Belgium sued IACSSO and preliminary rulings were found in their favour, adjudging that Sahaja Yoga was &quot;not a cult&quot;. However, on appeal in 2011 these preliminary rulings were overturned and in a final judgement it was found that Sahaja Yoga had been unable to refute IACSSO&#x27;s statements.

In 2013, &quot;De Morgen&quot; reported that the Belgian Department of State Security monitors how often politicians are contacted and lobbied by organizations. The list of organizations includes Sahaja Yoga.

In 2001, The &quot;Evening Standard&quot; reported that Sahaja Yoga has been &quot;described as a dangerous cult&quot; and &quot;has a dissident website created by former members&quot;. The reporter, John Crace, wrote about an event he attended and noted that a Sahaja Yoga representative asked him to feel free to talk to whomever he wanted. He remarked, &quot;Either their openness is a PR , or they genuinely have nothing to hide.&quot; He proposed that &quot;one of the key definitions of a cult is the rigour with which it strives to recruit new members&quot; and concluded that there was no aggressive recruitment squeeze.

David V. Barrett wrote that some former members say that they were expelled from the movement because they &quot;resisted influence that Mataji had over their lives&quot;. According to Barrett, the movement&#x27;s founder&#x27;s degree of control over members&#x27; lives has given rise to concerns. The Austrian Ministry for Environment, Youth and Family states that &quot;Sahaja Yoga&quot; regards Nirmala Srivastava as an authority who cannot be questioned.

<doc id="666422" wikidata="Q919034" url="?curid=666422" title="British Columbia Highway 97">
<text>Highway 97 is a major highway in the Canadian province of British Columbia. It is the longest continuously numbered route in the province, running and is the only route that runs the entire north–south length of British Columbia, connecting the Canada–United States border near Osoyoos in the south to the British Columbia–Yukon boundary in the north at Watson Lake, Yukon.

The highway connects several major cities in BC Interior, including Kelowna, Kamloops, Prince George, and Dawson Creek. Within and near these cities, Highway 97 varies from a two-lane highway to a freeway with as many as six lanes. Some remote sections also remain unpaved and gravelled. The route takes its number from U.S. Route 97, with which it connects at the international border. The highway was initially designated &#x27;97&#x27; in 1953.

== Route description ==

The busiest section of Highway 97 is in West Kelowna, carrying almost 70,000 vehicles per day. Some sections in the northern regions of the province have as few as 250 vehicles per day.

===Okanagan Highway===

The Okanagan Highway is a section of Highway 97 between the international border and the junction of Highway 97A north of Vernon. It is named for the Okanagan region of British Columbia, through which it largely passes. It begins in the south at the international border crossing north of Oroville, and travels north to its junction with the Crowsnest Highway (Highway 3) at Osoyoos. The highway travels north for , passing through the Testalinden Creek Landslide and the communities of Oliver and Okanagan Falls. From Okanagan Falls, Highway 97 runs near the western shore of Skaha Lake before arriving at the locality of Kaleden, where Highway 3A diverges west.

 north of Kaleden, Highway 97 arrives at the city of Penticton. North of Penticton, Highway 97 follows the western shore of Okanagan Lake for , through the communities of Summerland and Peachland, before reaching its junction with Highway 97C just south of Westbank. From there, Highway 97 passes through West Kelowna and reserve lands belonging to the Westbank First Nation until, northeast of the 97C junction, Highway 97 begins to cross Okanagan Lake via the William R. Bennett Bridge. The highway enters the city of Kelowna upon landfall on the east shore of the lake. east into the city centre, the highway reaches its junction with Highway 33. As the Okanagan is a very popular travel destination and also has the highest population in inland B.C. (about 300,000), this section of highway 97 is by far the busiest. Congestion is frequent - particularly near the William Bennett Bridge, and Southbound towards West Kelowna.

Four kilometres (2 mi) north of the Highway 33 junction, Highway 97 leaves the urbanized area of Kelowna (the municipal boundary is actually a further 12 km, 7 mi, north). For the next , the route travels well east of Okanagan Lake, passing through the community of Winfield. Prior to 2013, the highway ran alongside the west shore of Wood Lake to Oyama. A new section of four-lane highway was constructed and opened to traffic at that time, which bypasses Oyama entirely to the north. The original section of the highway skirting the western shore of Wood Lake is now known as &quot;Pelmewash Parkway&quot;. Both Oyama and Winfield lie within the municipality of Lake Country.

Highway 97 then passes along the west shore of Kalamalka Lake before entering the city of Vernon and a junction with Highway 6 just south of the city centre. The highway then travels north for to a junction with Highway 97A near Swan Lake.
===Vernon-Kamloops-Cache Creek===

Highway 97 continues northwest from Highway 97A for , past the town of Falkland, before it merges onto the Trans-Canada Highway at Monte Creek, and is known as the &quot;Vernon-Monte Creek Highway&quot;. The highway follows Highway 1 for west to Cache Creek. As it travels westward, Highways 1 and 97 parallel the Thompson River, passing through the city of Kamloops, where the route shares a wrong-way concurrency with Highway 5 (signed as 97 &quot;North&quot; and 5 &quot;South&quot; and vice versa) and intersects Highway 5A.

===Cariboo Highway===

The Cariboo Highway section of Highway 97, between Cache Creek and Prince George, is in length and named for the Cariboo region, through which it travels. Much of its length as far as Quesnel follows approximately the route of the original Cariboo Wagon Road, which was also known as the Queen&#x27;s Highway. The Cariboo Wagon Road&#x27;s lower stretches between Yale and Cache Creek were severed in many places by the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1880s. That section, now part of the Trans-Canada, was rebuilt in the 1920s, when the name Cariboo Highway was first applied to the route, a designation which ran from Yale to Prince George, British Columbia (where portions of the route survive as the Old Cariboo Highway). Today the Cariboo Highway designation begins at Cache Creek, veering north for to its junction with Highway 99. North of Highway 99, Highway 97 travels through Clinton, where the British Columbia Railway begins to roughly parallel Highway 97, as well as through the community of 70 Mile House before reaching a junction at 93 Mile House with Highway 24 (the Interlakes Highway). The roughly section of highway between 70 Mile House and Highway 24 has been re-routed to a new expressway with a speed limit of 110km/h.

Over the of road north of Highway 24, Highway 97 travels through 100 Mile House and 150 Mile House before reaching the city of Williams Lake and a junction with Highway 20, which runs west across the Chilcotin District to Bella Coola on the Central Coast. Over the next continuing generally northward, the highway passes through McLeese Lake and Marguerite. En route, Highway 97 follows the east bank of the Fraser River to the city of Quesnel, and a junction with Highway 26. Over the next north of Quesnel, after passing through the hamlets of Strathnaver, Hixon, Stoner and Red Rock, Highway 97 meets its junction with Highway 16 at Prince George. North of here, the highway veers away from the Fraser River, and the British Columbia Railway veers northwestward from it.

The term Cariboo Highway originally applied to the reconstructed route from Hope through the Fraser Canyon to Cache Creek and Prince George. Constructed in 1924-25, the new gravel toll highway opened in 1926, giving road access to canyon communities cut off since the destruction of parts of the Cariboo Road by construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1880s. The Cariboo Highway designation for the Fraser Canyon portion of the route was supplanted with the completion and naming of the Trans-Canada Highway c.-1962. Portions of the old highway survive as local streets, some carrying the name Old Cariboo Highway (as in Prince George).
===John Hart Highway===

This stretch of Highway 97, named for former British Columbia Premier John Hart, begins at the John Hart Bridge crossing the Nechako River in Prince George, travelling for north through the small hamlet of Summit Lake, which is situated at the Continental Divide, as well as through Crooked River Provincial Park, Bear Lake and McLeod Lake, to its intersection with Highway 39. It then journeys northeast another over the crest of the Rocky Mountains via the Pine Pass, at which point the time zone changes from Pacific Time to Mountain Time. After descending from the Pine Pass, the highway generally follows the Pine River northeast to its intersection with Highway 29 at the town of Chetwynd. After a trek of another east, the Hart Highway terminates at Dawson Creek.

===Alaska Highway===

This northernmost section of Highway 97 is long, and travels north through largely unpopulated wilderness, intersecting the communities of Fort St. John and Fort Nelson, the latter being just east of the junction of Highway 77, travelling north to the Northwest Territories. Here, the highway veers generally northwestward into wilderness spotted with tiny localities. As it passes over the Rocky Mountains, the highway parallels the Liard River before terminating just over the BC/Yukon boundary at Watson Lake, where the Alaska Highway is numbered as Yukon Highway 1.

<text>The regions of Ghana are the first level of subnational government administration within the Republic of Ghana. As of 2020, there are 16 regions, which are further divided for administrative purposes into 260 local metropolitan, municipal and district assemblies (or MMDA&#x27;s).

==Current regions==
The ten former regions were officially established in 1987, when the Upper West Region was inaugurated as the state&#x27;s newest administrative region, although it had already functioned as an administrative unit since the break-up of the Upper Region in December 1982, prior to the 1984 national census. A referendum on the creation of six new regions was held on 27 December 2018, where all proposed new regions were approved.

==Previous regional configurations==
===Independence - 6 March 1957===
At independence in March 1957, the Northern Territories, Ashanti, Trans-Volta Togoland and the Gold Coast came together to form Ghana. There were initially five regions. The Trans-Volta Togoland was combined with part of the Eastern Region and Northern Territories to form the Volta Region.

===Post-independence and First Republic===
On 4 April 1959, the Ashanti Region was split into the Ashanti and Brong-Ahafo regions as a result of the Brong Ahafo Region Act No. 18 of 1959. This was in line with what the Brong Kyempem movement had been campaigning for, which was the recognition of the Bono people as a separate ethnic group from the Ashantis with their own region.

On the day Ghana became a republic, 1 July 1960, the Northern Region got split into the Northern and Upper regions raising the number of regions to seven.

===Second Republic===
During the Second Republic, the Western Region was split into the Western and Central regions, making eight regions in total. This was done ahead of the 1970 census. In 1971, Sekondi and Takoradi were merged to form Sekondi-Takoradi, the new capital of the Western Region.

===PNDC era===
The Provisional National Defence Council, which was the military government in power between 1981 and 1993, promulgated the Greater Accra Law (PNDCL 26) of 23 July 1982 which created the Greater Accra Region. The new region consisted of the Accra Capital District and the Ada Local Council, which were split off from the Eastern Region. In the following year 1983, the Upper Region was divided into the Upper East Region and Upper West Region, bringing the total number of regions to ten.

<doc id="666431" wikidata="Q843550" url="?curid=666431" title="Polynomial-time approximation scheme">
<text>In computer science (particularly algorithmics), a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) is a type of approximation algorithm for optimization problems (most often, NP-hard optimization problems).

A PTAS is an algorithm which takes an instance of an optimization problem and a parameter and produces a solution that is within a factor of being optimal (or for maximization problems). For example, for the Euclidean traveling salesman problem, a PTAS would produce a tour with length at most , with being the length of the shortest tour. 

The running time of a PTAS is required to be polynomial in the problem size for every fixed ε, but can be different for different ε. Thus an algorithm running in time or even counts as a PTAS.

==Variants==
===Deterministic===
A practical problem with PTAS algorithms is that the exponent of the polynomial could increase dramatically as ε shrinks, for example if the runtime is . One way of addressing this is to define the efficient polynomial-time approximation scheme or EPTAS, in which the running time is required to be for a constant independent of . This ensures that an increase in problem size has the same relative effect on runtime regardless of what ε is being used; however, the constant under the big-O can still depend on ε arbitrarily. In other words, an EPTAS runs in FPT time where the parameter is ε. 

Even more restrictive, and useful in practice, is the fully polynomial-time approximation scheme or FPTAS, which requires the algorithm to be polynomial in both the problem size and . 

Unless P = NP, it holds that . Consequently, under this assumption, APX-hard problems do not have PTASs.

Another deterministic variant of the PTAS is the quasi-polynomial-time approximation scheme or QPTAS. A QPTAS has time complexity for each fixed . Furthermore, a PTAS can run in FPT time for some parameterization of the problem, which leads to a parameterized approximation scheme.

===Randomized===
Some problems which do not have a PTAS may admit a randomized algorithm with similar properties, a polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme or PRAS. A PRAS is an algorithm which takes an instance of an optimization or counting problem and a parameter and, in polynomial time, produces a solution that has a &quot;high probability&quot; of being within a factor of optimal. Conventionally, &quot;high probability&quot; means probability greater than 3/4, though as with most probabilistic complexity classes the definition is robust to variations in this exact value (the bare minimum requirement is generally greater than 1/2). Like a PTAS, a PRAS must have running time polynomial in , but not necessarily in ; with further restrictions on the running time in , one can define an efficient polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme or EPRAS similar to the EPTAS, and a fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme or FPRAS similar to the FPTAS.

==As a complexity class==
The term PTAS may also be used to refer to the class of optimization problems that have a PTAS. PTAS is a subset of APX, and unless P = NP, it is a strict subset. 

Membership in PTAS can be shown using a PTAS reduction, L-reduction, or P-reduction, all of which preserve PTAS membership, and these may also be used to demonstrate PTAS-completeness. On the other hand, showing non-membership in PTAS (namely, the nonexistence of a PTAS), may be done by showing that the problem is APX-hard, after which the existence of a PTAS would show P = NP. APX-hardness is commonly shown via PTAS reduction or AP-reduction.

<doc id="666432" wikidata="Q363623" url="?curid=666432" title="Cassivellaunus">
<text>Cassivellaunus was a historical British military leader who led the defence against Julius Caesar&#x27;s second expedition to Britain in 54 BC. He led an alliance of tribes against Roman forces, but eventually surrendered after his location was revealed to Julius Caesar by defeated Britons.

Cassivellaunus made an impact on the British consciousness. He appears in British legend as Cassibelanus, one of Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s kings of the Britons, and in the &quot;Mabinogi&quot;, &quot;Brut y Brenhinedd&quot; and the Welsh Triads as Caswallawn, son of Beli Mawr.

== Name ==
The Common Brittonic personal name &quot;Cassiuellaunos&quot; stems from the word &quot;uellaunos&quot; (&#x27;chief, commandant&#x27;). The meaning of the prefix &quot;cassi-&quot; has been debated, but it possibly signifies &#x27;tin, bronze&#x27;. Cassivellaunus may thus been translated as &#x27;Chief-of-Tin&#x27;, that is to say &#x27;the inflexible&#x27;. The personal name &quot;Ver-cassivellaunus&quot; (&#x27;True-Chief-of-Tin&#x27;) is related.

==History==
Cassivellaunus appears in Julius Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot;, having been given command of the combined British forces opposing Caesar&#x27;s second invasion of Britain. Caesar does not mention Cassivellaunus&#x27;s tribe, but his territory, north of the River Thames, corresponds with that inhabited by the tribe named the Catuvellauni at the time of the later invasion under Claudius.

Caesar tells us that Cassivellaunus had previously been in near-constant conflict with his neighbours, as was typical of the British tribes in this period, and had recently brought down the king of the Trinovantes, the most powerful tribe in Britain at the time. The king&#x27;s son, Mandubracius, fled to Caesar in Gaul. Despite Cassivellaunus&#x27;s harrying tactics, designed to prevent Caesar&#x27;s army from foraging and plundering for food, Caesar advanced to the Thames. The only fordable point was defended and fortified with sharp stakes, but the Romans managed to cross it. Cassivellaunus dismissed most of his army and resorted to guerilla tactics, relying on his knowledge of the territory and the speed of his chariots.

Five British tribes, the Cenimagni, the Segontiaci, the Ancalites, the Bibroci and the Cassi, surrendered to Caesar and revealed the location of Cassivellaunus&#x27;s stronghold. (Possibles sites include Hexton and the Devil&#x27;s Dyke, Wheathampstead). Caesar proceeded to put the stronghold under siege. Cassivellaunus managed to get a message to the four kings of Kent, Cingetorix, Carvilius, Taximagulus and Segovax, to gather their forces and attack the Roman camp on the coast, but the Romans defended themselves successfully, capturing a chieftain called Lugotorix. On hearing of the defeat and the devastation of his territories, Cassivellaunus surrendered. The terms were mediated by Commius, Caesar&#x27;s Gallic ally. Hostages were given and a tribute agreed. Mandubracius was restored to the kingship of the Trinovantes, and Cassivellaunus undertook not to wage war against him. All this achieved, Caesar returned to Gaul where a poor harvest had caused unrest. The Roman legions did not return to Britain for another 97 years.

The Greek author Polyaenus relates an anecdote in his &quot;Stratagemata&quot; that Caesar overcame Cassivellaunus&#x27;s defence of a river crossing by means of an armoured elephant. This claim may derive from a confusion with the Roman conquest of 43 AD, when Claudius is supposed to have brought elephants to Britain.

==Legend==
===&quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;===

Cassivellaunus appears in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s 12th century work &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (&quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot;), usually spelled Cassibelanus or Cassibelaunus. The younger son of the former king Heli, he becomes king of Britain upon the death of his elder brother Lud, whose own sons Androgeus and Tenvantius are not yet of age. In recompense, Androgeus is made Duke of Kent and Trinovantum (London), and Tenvantius is made Duke of Cornwall.

After his conquest of Gaul, Julius Caesar sets his sights on Britain, and sends a letter to Cassibelanus demanding tribute. Cassibelanus refuses, citing the Britons&#x27; and Romans&#x27; common Trojan descent (see Brutus of Britain), and Caesar invades at the Thames Estuary. During the fighting, Cassibelanus&#x27;s brother Nennius encounters Caesar and sustains a severe head wound. Caesar&#x27;s sword gets stuck in Nennius&#x27;s shield, and when the two are separated in the mêlée, Nennius throws away his own sword and attacks the Romans with Caesar&#x27;s, killing many, including the tribune Labienus. The Britons hold firm, and that night Caesar flees back to Gaul. Cassibelanus&#x27;s celebrations are muted by Nennius&#x27;s death from his head wound. He is buried with the sword he took from Caesar, which is named &quot;Crocea Mors&quot; (Yellow Death).

Two years later, Caesar invades again with a larger force. Cassibelanus, forewarned, had planted stakes beneath the waterline of the Thames which gut Caesar&#x27;s ships, drowning thousands of men. The Romans are once again quickly put to flight.

The leaders of the Britons gather in Trinovantum to thank the gods for their victory with many animal sacrifices and celebrate with sporting events. During a wrestling bout, Cassibelanus&#x27;s nephew Hirelglas is killed by Androgeus&#x27;s nephew Cuelinus. Cassibelanus demands that Androgeus turn his nephew over to him for trial, but Androgeus refuses, insisting he should be tried in his own court in Trinovantum. Cassibelanus threatens war, and Androgeus appeals to Caesar for help, agreeing to accept him as liege and sending his son as a hostage.

Caesar invades a third time, landing at Richborough. As Cassibelaunus&#x27;s army meets Caesar&#x27;s, Androgeus attacks Cassibelaunus from the rear with five thousand men. His line broken, Cassibelanus retreats to a nearby hilltop. After two days siege, Androgeus appeals to Caesar to offer terms. Cassibelanus agrees to pay tribute of three thousand pounds of silver, and he and Caesar become friends.

Six years later, Cassibelanus dies and is buried in York. Androgeus has gone to Rome with Caesar, so Tenvantius succeeds as king of Britain.

===Welsh literature===

Cassivellaunus appears as Caswallawn, son of Beli Mawr, in the Welsh Triads, the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;, and the Welsh versions of Geoffrey&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; known as &quot;Brut y Brenhinedd&quot;. In the Second Branch of the Mabinogi, he appears as a usurper, who seizes the throne of Britain while the rightful king, Bran the Blessed, is at war in Ireland. Using a magic cloak which renders him invisible, he kills six of the seven stewards Bran has left in charge, while the seventh, Bran&#x27;s son Caradog, dies of despair at the sight of a disembodied sword killing his men. He then appears in the Third Branch, in which Bran&#x27;s followers offer their submission to him to avoid fighting. He is also mentioned in the tale &quot;Lludd and Llefelys&quot;, which features his two brothers Lludd Llaw Eraint (Geoffrey&#x27;s Lud) and Llefelys.

Caswallawn is referenced frequently in the Welsh Triads. Triad 51 describes his conflict with &quot;Afarwy&quot; (Mandubracius/Androgeus) as described in Geoffrey of Monmouth, while Triad 95 references the story of Caradawg son of Bran&#x27;s death as told in the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;. However, other triads (35, 36, 38, 59, 67, and 71) refer to a tradition about Caswallawn not drawn from either Roman nor existing medieval sources. Triad 38 names his horse as Meinlas (&quot;Slender Gray&quot;) and calls him one of the Three Bestowed Horses of the Island of Britain; this is echoed in Triad 59, in which the decision to allow the Romans to land in Britain in exchange for Meinlas is called one of the Three Unfortunate Counsels of the Island of Britain. Triad 35 indicates that Caswallawn left Britain with 21,000 men in pursuit of Caesar and never returned.

Triads 67 and 71 portray Caswallawn as a great lover, who competed with Caesar over the beautiful Fflur. He is named as one of the Three Golden Shoemakers of the Island of Britain in relation to his trip to Rome seeking his love; context suggests he disguised himself as a shoemaker. A later collection of triads compiled by the 18th-century Welsh antiquarian Iolo Morganwg gives an expanded version of this tradition, including the details that Caswallawn had abducted Fflur from Caesar in Gaul, killing 6,000 Romans, and that Caesar invaded Britain in response. As with the rest of Morganwg&#x27;s Triads, however, the provenance of these references is suspect. However, the 12th-century poet Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr knew of some version of the Fflur story, writing that Caesar&#x27;s love for her was costly.

Welsh scholar Rachel Bromwich suggests the fragmentary allusions to Caswallawn in the Triads relate to a narrative of the character that has been lost. This may have been in the form of a romance detailing the king&#x27;s adventures, but would have been largely uninfluenced by the classical accounts.
