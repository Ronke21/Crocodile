<text>Colonel René Paul Fonck (27 March 1894 – 18 June 1953) was a French aviator who ended the First World War as the top Entente fighter ace and, when all succeeding aerial conflicts of the 20th and 21st centuries are also considered, Fonck still holds the title of &quot;all-time Allied Ace of Aces&quot;. He received confirmation for 75 victories (72 solo and three shared) out of 142 claims. Taking into account his probable claims, Fonck&#x27;s final tally could conceivably be nearer 100 or above. He was made an Officer of the Legion of Honor in 1918 and later a Commander of the Legion of Honor after the war, and raised again to the dignity of Grand Officer.

==Early life==
Fonck was born on 27 March 1894 in the village of Saulcy-sur-Meurthe in the Vosges region of north eastern France. Fonck left school when he was 13. 
Although he had been interested in aviation from his youth, he was rejected for the air service when conscripted on 22 August 1914. Instead, he underwent five months basic training for the role of combat engineer; his training duties included first digging trenches near Épinal, and later bridge repairs on the Moselle River.

==Military aviation career==

===1915–1916===
On 15 February 1915 he was finally accepted into basic training to learn how to fly. He trained at St. Cyr and then at Le Crotoy on a Blériot Penguin, a reduced-wingspan &quot;flightless&quot; version of the famous Blériot XI aircraft that gave the sensation of flying while still on the ground. He completed his pilot training in May 1915 and then flew Caudron G III observation aircraft with &quot;Escadrille&quot; C 47.

On 25 May 1916 Fonck&#x27;s observer was killed by an anti-aircraft shell burst, a fate that almost befell Fonck a few weeks later. Fonck claimed his first enemy aircraft in July 1916, but his victory was unconfirmed.

On 6 August, he attacked a German Rumpler C.III, and by maneuvering over and around the reconnaissance plane, staying out of its fields of fire, forced it lower and lower until the German crew landed behind French lines. It was his first verified victory, though shared with his observer, Lieutenant Thiberge. It brought him the Médaille militaire in late August 1916.

===1917===
On 17 March 1917, Fonck scored a second time, downing an Albatros in conjunction with his observer, Sergeant Huffer. By this time, Fonck had amassed over 500 hours flight time, an incredible amount in those early days of aviation.

Aged 23, on 15 April 1917 (&quot;Bloody April&quot;), Fonck received a coveted invitation to join the famous &quot;Escadrille les Cigognes&quot;. &quot;Groupe de Combat 12&quot;, with its four escadrilles (or squadrons), was the world&#x27;s first fighter wing. The then leading French ace, Georges Guynemer, was serving at the time in one of its escadrilles, N3, and had just scored his 36th victory.

Fonck was assigned to another escadrille in the group, Spa 103. Flying the SPAD VII, he quickly made a name for himself, attaining flying ace status by 13 May. He picked off another target on 12 June, then went on hiatus until 9 August. He scored twice more that month, on 21 and 22 August.

On 14 September, he killed the pilot of a German observation plane and watched as the plane inverted and dropped the thrashing observer almost through the wing of Fonck&#x27;s Spad. He even went to the extreme of tearing the barograph out of the cockpit of that day&#x27;s victim, his twelfth, so its readout would confirm his combat report. On 30 September, he and Adjutant Dupre jointly shot down a German two-seater Rumpler C.IV 6787/16 of FA 18. The news reported the killed pilot to be &quot;Leutnant&quot; Kurt Wissemann, who had allegedly shot down Guynemer, and that Fonck had boasted of avenging the death of his &quot;good friend&quot;. This story is put into question by German records, indicating that Wissemann of &quot;Jasta 3&quot; had been killed two days before in a different fight, in which he was flying a single-seater, probably against No. 56 Squadron.

September and October added four victories apiece to Fonck&#x27;s score. Thus, by year&#x27;s end, he had raised his tally to nineteen, was commissioned an officer, and had received the &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;.

Fonck got only better. Known for his clinical professionalism, he applied mathematical principles to combat flying, and his engineering knowledge regarding the capabilities of the aircraft he flew was unsurpassed by his fellow pilots. Fonck took few chances, patiently stalking his intended victims from higher altitudes. He then used deflection shooting with deadly accuracy at close range, resulting in an astonishing economy of ammunition expended per kill. More often than not, a single burst of less than five rounds from his Vickers machine gun was sufficient. His preferred method of aerial combat was not to engage into dogfights, but to carry out surgically merciless executions. He was also reputed to be able to spot enemy observation aircraft from very far away, where most other pilots would have perceived nothing.

Fonck, like France&#x27;s leading ace, Captain Guynemer, flew a limited-production SPAD XII fighter, distinguished by the presence of a hand-loaded 37mm Puteaux cannon firing through the propeller boss. He is apparently credited with downing 11 German airplanes with this type of armament, called a &quot;moteur-canon&quot;. This was made possible by the gear-reduction version of the Hispano-Suiza V8 SOHC engine first used in that model of SPAD fighter. It offset the now-hollow propeller shaft above the crankshaft axis, and the 37mm cannon was mounted in the V space between the two rows of cylinders. Fonck would later fly the highly successful SPAD XIII, the first SPAD fighter model to use twin Vickers machine guns.

===1918===
[[File:M 251 15 Fonck après sa 60e victoire.jpg|thumb|upright|A September 1918 magazine &quot;Le Miroir&quot; article (no. 251, p. 15) showing Fonck with a German Cross emblem from what is allegedly his 60th victory; in fact it was taken 30 September 1917 when Fonck was injured in a plane rollover after shooting down a german 2 seater north of Poperinghe for his 15th Victory]
He did not add to his tally sheet until 19 January 1918, when he scored a double victory. February added another five, March seven more, and another three in April.

Then came a spectacular performance on 9 May. It was sparked by a disagreement between Fonck and two of his squadronmates, [[Edwin C. Parsons]] and [[Frank Baylies]]. Perturbed by Fonck&#x27;s lectures on aerial success, the two Americans bet Fonck a bottle of champagne that one of them would shoot down an enemy plane before Fonck. Baylies took off despite hazy weather and shot down a [[Halberstadt CL.II]]. Back at the airfield, rather than pay off the bet, a sulky Fonck badgered the Americans to change the terms of the bet so that whoever shot down the most Germans that day would win. Lingering fog kept Fonck grounded most of the day. It was well into the afternoon before it cleared enough for him to take off at 1500 hours. Between 1600 and 1605 hours, he shot down three enemy two-seater reconnaissance planes. A couple of hours later, he repeated the feat. Understanding the importance of reconnaissance planes, with their potential to direct intensive artillery fire onto French troops, Fonck concentrated his attention upon them; six shot down within a three-hour span proved it.

He added a double victory on 19 May and five more in June. By now, he was shooting doubles frequently, and with 49 on his score sheet, he was rapidly closing in on Guynemer&#x27;s record.

On 18 July 1918, he achieved another double, to bring his total to 53 and into a tie with Guynemer. The following day, he shot down three more enemy aircraft and surpassed the score of the legendary Guynemer, who had remained the leading French ace despite his death on 11 September 1917.

He added four more victories in August, raising his total to 60. Then, on 26 September, he repeated his feat of knocking down six enemy airplanes in a day, although this time three of his six victories were over [[Fokker D.VII]] fighters.

Another success two days later and two on 5 October put his score at 69, very close to the 72 of Major [[William Avery Bishop]], then the leading Allied ace. On 30 October, he matched Bishop with three more victories. He shot down two more the following day, and another the day after that, finishing with 75 confirmed victories.

To summarize, he claimed 56 victories during the whole of 1918, attaining a total of 36 kills before May 1918. His 1918 list by itself would have made him France&#x27;s leading ace. By the end of the war, he had accounted for all but 36 of [[Escadrille SPA.103]]&#x27;s 111 claimed victories. Unlike many leading French aces, Fonck&#x27;s score contained only three shared victories. Also unlike most aces, he remained unwounded; indeed, only a single enemy bullet had ever hit his aircraft. He had also forgone the most hazardous air-to-air combat: he shot down no [[observation balloon]]s.

Yet for all his skill and success, Fonck never captured the hearts of the French public as Guynemer had. Fonck was ascetic and withdrawn. Instead of drinking or socializing with the other pilots, he planned his flying missions and tactics, ironed his uniforms, and stayed physically fit through [[calisthenics]]. He seemed to overcompensate for his shyness by constantly mentioning his exploits. As a result, he seemed distant, arrogant, even abrasive. His comrades respected his skills, but even one of his few friends, [[Marcel Haegelen]], considered him a braggart and shameless self-promoter. Fonck may have resented the fact that Guynemer remained more popular in the French press even after he surpassed him in victories. Fonck also seemed to lack insight into the effect his personality had upon his image or career. However he and he alone carried the flag of the French Air Force at the victory parade on the Champs-Elysées.

==After the war==

Fonck returned to civilian life after World War I, and published his war memoirs &quot;Mes Combats&quot;, prefaced by [[Ferdinand Foch|Marechal Foch]], in 1920. The fame he got from the war allowed him to be elected Member of Parliament representing the [[Vosges]] from 1919 to 1924.

During the 1920s, Fonck persuaded [[Igor Sikorsky]] to redesign the [[Sikorsky S-35]] for the transatlantic race or [[Orteig Prize]]. On 21 September 1926, the aircraft crashed on takeoff when the landing gear collapsed, killing two of his three crew members. [[Charles Lindbergh]] won the prize seven months later in 1927.

Fonck eventually returned to military aviation and rose to Inspector of French fighter forces from 1937 to 1939.

His inter-war contact with the likes of former World War I foe [[Hermann Göring]] and [[Ernst Udet]] cast a shadow upon Fonck&#x27;s reputation during the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German occupation of France]], as did allegations of collaboration with the Nazis and the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]]. In January 1941, Fonck was made a member of the National Council of Vichy France. On 10 August 1940, Vichy Foreign Minister [[Pierre Laval]] announced that Fonck had recruited 200 French pilots to fight on the Nazi side. However, the truth was more complicated. Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]] wished to exploit Fonck&#x27;s relationship with Göring in order to meet [[Adolf Hitler]]. He ordered [[Colonel]] Fonck to talk to Göring. A meeting was planned at [[Montoire]], but after discovering evidence about the pro-Nazi politics of [[Pierre Laval]], Fonck tried to convince Pétain not to attend. Initially Pétain appeared to heed Fonck&#x27;s advice, but for some reason he eventually decided to disregard Fonck&#x27;s warnings and met Hitler at Montoire on 24 October 1940. Fonck&#x27;s loyalties were thus questioned by the Vichy regime, and he returned home to Paris, where he was eventually arrested by the [[Gestapo]] and imprisoned in the [[Drancy internment camp]].

After the war, a French police inquiry about his supposed collaboration with the Vichy regime completely cleared Fonck. The conclusion was that his loyalty was proved by his close contacts with recognised resistance leaders such as [[Alfred Heurtaux]] during the war. He was awarded the [[French Resistance|Certificate of Resistance]] in 1948. The citation reads: &quot;Mr. Fonck, René, a member of the fighting French forces without uniform, took part, in territory occupied by the enemy, to glorious fights for the liberation of the nation&quot;.

Fonck remained in Paris, but also frequently visited his native Lorraine, where he had business interests.

He died of a stroke in his Paris apartment, Rue du Cirque, at the age of 59 and is buried in the cemetery of his native village of [[Saulcy-sur-Meurthe]].

<text>Rowayton is a coastal neighborhood in the city of Norwalk, Connecticut, roughly from New York City. The community is governed by the Sixth Taxing District of Norwalk and has a number of active local associations, including the Civic Association, the Historical Society, the Rowayton Library, a Gardeners Club, and a Parents Exchange. Rowayton annually plays host to a Shakespearean production at Pinkney Park, produced by Shakespeare on the Sound, and also has an active community of artists, many of whom are associated with the Rowayton Arts Center.

The Rowayton station on the New Haven line of the Metro-North Railroad is located within the community, as is an elementary school, a public beach for residents and the Rowayton Public Library.

==Coastline==
The Rowayton coastline has been a source of inspiration for centuries. John Frederick Kensett, a famous 19th century landscape painter of the Hudson School, frequently painted this seascape in his later life. This tradition has been carried on in an active local arts scene.

Rowayton is home to a number of private and semi-private beaches, three of which—The Roton Point Association, Bayley Beach, and a coastal outpost of Wee Burn Country Club—share a common history. In the early 20th century, the properties of all three made up the Roton Point Amusement Park. A boat landing attached to Sunset Rock, just to the West of Belle Island, allowed steam boats to bring day-trippers from New York City to the park. A trolley ran from both Darien and Norwalk, arriving at the Park via Highland Avenue and over present-day Langdon Preserve, located across from Farm Creek. At the amusement park, amenities included a bath house, a picnic grove, and rides ranging from the classic carousel to roller coasters with views of the beach.

==&quot;Rock Ledge&quot; estate==

The former &quot;Rock Ledge&quot; estate at 33 and 40-42 Highland Avenue was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. In 1910, James A. Farrell, later president of the United States Steel Corporation, built a Tudor revival mansion, which burned down in 1913 and was rebuilt in granite. The estate was later bought by the Remington Rand Corporation, developers of the UNIVAC computer, of which General Douglas MacArthur was Chairman of the Board in the 1950s, and which merged with Sperry Corporation to form Sperry Rand. Since 1966, the Farrell family stables have been converted to the Rowayton Community Center and the Rowayton Library. In 1964, the main part of the estate was purchased by the Thomas School for girls, a day and boarding school founded by Mabel Thomas in 1922. The school eventually merged with another private school in Stamford, Connecticut, later becoming coeducational King Low Heywood Thomas. The mansion and attached office building were subsequently owned by Hewitt Associates. Currently, the main house of the estate is the headquarters of Graham Capital Management, L.P.

<text>Stamford Bridge () is a football stadium in Fulham, adjacent to the borough of Chelsea in West London. It is the home of Premier League club Chelsea.
With a capacity of 40,173, it is the ninth largest venue of the 2024–25 Premier League season and the eleventh largest football stadium in England.

Opened in 1877, the stadium was used by London Athletic Club until 1905, when new owner Gus Mears founded Chelsea Football Club to occupy the ground; Chelsea have played their home games there ever since. It has undergone major changes over the years, most recently in the 1990s when it was renovated into a modern, all-seater stadium.

Stamford Bridge has hosted Charity Shield games. It has also hosted numerous other sports, such as cricket, rugby union, rugby league, speedway, greyhound racing, baseball and American football. The stadium&#x27;s highest official attendance is 82,905, for a league match between Chelsea and Arsenal on 12 October 1935.

==History==

===Early history===
&quot;Stamford Bridge&quot; is considered to be a derivative of &quot;Samfordesbrigge&quot; meaning &quot;the bridge at the sandy ford&quot;. Eighteenth century maps show a &quot;Stanford Creek&quot; running along the route of what is now a railway line at the back of the East Stand as a tributary of the Thames. The upper reaches of this tributary have been known as Billingswell Ditch, Pools Creek and Counters Creek. In medieval times the creek was known as Billingwell Dyche, derived from &quot;Billing&#x27;s spring or stream&quot;. It formed the boundary between the parishes of Kensington and Fulham. By the 18th century, the creek had become known as Counter&#x27;s Creek, which is the name it has retained since.

The stream had two local bridges: Stamford Bridge on the Fulham Road (also recorded as Little Chelsea Bridge) and Stanbridge on the King&#x27;s Road, now known as Stanley Bridge. The existing Stamford Bridge was built of brick in 1860–1862 and since been partly reconstructed.


Stamford Bridge opened in 1877 as a home for the London Athletic Club and was used almost exclusively for that purpose until 1904, when the lease was acquired by brothers Gus and Joseph Mears, who wanted to stage high-profile professional football matches there. However, previous to this, in 1898, Stamford Bridge played host to the World Championship of shinty between Beauly Shinty Club and London Camanachd. Stamford Bridge was built near the Lillie Bridge Grounds, an older sports ground which had hosted the 1873 FA Cup Final and the first ever amateur boxing matches (among other things). It was initially offered to Fulham Football Club, but they turned it down for financial reasons. After considering the sale of the land to the Great Western Railway Company, the Mears decided to found their own football club, Chelsea, to occupy the ground as a rival to Fulham. Noted football ground architect Archibald Leitch, who had also designed Ibrox, Celtic Park, Craven Cottage and Hampden Park, was hired to construct the stadium. In its early days, Stamford Bridge stadium was served by a small railway station, Chelsea and Fulham railway station, which was later closed after World War II bombing.

Stamford Bridge was initially planned to have a capacity of around 100,000 and was the second largest ground in England after Crystal Palace. It was used as the FA Cup final venue. As originally constructed, Stamford Bridge was an athletics track and the pitch was initially located in the middle of the running track. This meant that spectators were separated from the field of play on all sides by the width of running track and, on the north and south sides, the separation was particularly large because the long sides of the running track considerably exceeded the length of the football pitch. The stadium had a single stand for 5,000 spectators on the east side. Designed by Archibald Leitch, it was an exact replica of the Stevenage Road Stand he had previously built at the re-developed Craven Cottage (and the main reason why Fulham had chosen not to move into the new ground). The other sides were all open in a vast bowl and thousands of tons of material excavated from the building of the Piccadilly line provided high terracing for standing spectators exposed to the elements on the west side.

In 1945, Stamford Bridge staged one of the most notable matches in its history. Soviet side FC Dynamo Moscow were invited to tour the United Kingdom at the end of the Second World War and Chelsea were the first side they faced. An estimated crowd of over 100,000 crammed into Stamford Bridge to watch a 3–3 draw, with many spectators on the dog track and on top of the stands.

===Crisis===

In the early 1970s the club&#x27;s owners initiated a project to renovate Stamford Bridge. However, the cost of building the East Stand escalated out of control after shortages of materials and a builders&#x27; strike and the remainder of the ground remained untouched. The new East Stand was finished, but most of the (unusable) running tracks remained, and the new stand was also displaced by approximately 20 metres, compared to the pitch. The idea was to move the entire stadium towards the north. But due to the financial situation in the mid-1970s the other stands were not rebuilt for another two decades. In the meantime, Chelsea struggled in the league, and attendances fell and debts increased. The club was relegated to the Second Division in 1975 and again in 1979, narrowly avoiding the drop into the Third Division in 1983 before finally returning to the First Division a year later.

The increase in the costs, combined with other factors, sent the club into decline. As a part of financial restructuring in the late 1970s, the freehold was separated from the club and when new Chelsea chairman Ken Bates bought the club for £1 in 1982, he did not buy the ground. A large chunk of the Stamford Bridge freehold was subsequently sold to property developers Marler Estates. The sale resulted in a long and acrimonious legal fight between Bates and Marler Estates. Marler Estates was ultimately forced into bankruptcy after a market crash in the early 1990s, allowing Bates to do a deal with its banks and re-unite the freehold with the club.

During the 1984–85 season, following a series of pitch invasions and fights by football hooligans during matches at the stadium, chairman Ken Bates erected an electric perimeter fence between the stands and the pitch – identical to the one which effectively controlled cattle on his dairy farm. However, the electric fence was never turned on and before long it was dismantled, due to the GLC blocking it from being switched on for health and safety reasons.

===Modernisation and redevelopment===
With the Taylor Report arising from the Hillsborough disaster being published in January 1990 and ordering all top division clubs to have all-seater stadiums in time for the 1994–95 season, Chelsea&#x27;s plan for a 34,000-seat stadium at Stamford Bridge was given approval by Hammersmith and Fulham council on 19 July 1990.

The re-building of the stadium commenced and successive building phases during the 1990s eliminated the original running track. The construction of the East Stand some 20 years earlier had begun the process of eliminating the track. All stands, now roofed and all-seater, are immediately adjacent to the pitch. This structure captures and concentrates the noise of supporters. The pitch, the turnstiles, and the naming rights of the club are now owned by Chelsea Pitch Owners, an organisation set up to prevent the stadium from being purchased by property developers.

KSS Design Group (architects) designed the complete redevelopment of Stamford Bridge Stadium and its hotels, megastore, offices and residential buildings.

==Other uses==
===Other football events===
Stamford Bridge was the venue of the FA Cup Final from 1920 to 1922, before being replaced by Wembley Stadium in 1923. It has staged ten FA Cup semi-finals, ten Charity Shield matches, and three England matches, the last in 1932. It was one of the home venues for the representative London XI team that played in the original Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. The team played the home leg of the two-legged final at Stamford Bridge, drawing 2–2 with FC Barcelona; they lost the away leg 6–0, however.

On 23 May 2013, the stadium hosted the final of the 2012–13 UEFA Women&#x27;s Champions League.

On 5 August 2023, Stamford Bridge hosted charity match Game4Ukraine to raise money for the United24 initiative, a fundraiser to help in Ukraine&#x27;s rebuilding of facilities and infrastructure that suffered damage from the Russian invasion of Ukraine as well as the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War.

In 2019 and 2024, Stamford Bridge has also been used as the venue for Soccer Aid, an annual charity match initially organised by singer Robbie Williams and actor Jonathan Wilkes.

====Chelsea Women====
Since the 2010s, Chelsea F.C. Women, the club&#x27;s women&#x27;s affiliate, has played selected games at Stamford Bridge, including league games against domestic rivals as well as all UEFA Women&#x27;s Champions League games.

===Other sports===
Stamford Bridge has also hosted a variety of other sporting events since Chelsea have occupied the ground. In October 1905 it hosted a rugby union match between the All Blacks and Middlesex, and in 1908, Stamford Bridge was the venue for a Rugby League international between Great Britain and the touring New Zealand All Golds, who won 18–6. Two New Zealanders George Smith and William &quot;Massa&quot; Johnston played and scored in both these games. Two further Rugby League games were held in 1952, British Empire XIII v New Zealand, and 1983, Fulham v Cardiff. In 1914 Stamford Bridge hosted a baseball match between the touring New York Giants and the Chicago White Sox. In 1924 the stadium hosted the 1924 Women&#x27;s Olympiad, the first international event for women in track and field in the UK. A speedway team operated from the stadium from 1929 until 1932, winning the Southern League in their opening season. Initially open meetings were held there in 1928. A nineteen-year-old junior rider, Charlie Biddle, was killed in a racing accident. In 1931, black cinders were laid onto the circuit suitable for use by speedway and athletics. A midget car meeting reportedly attracted a crowd of 50,000 people in 1948.

The ground was used in 1980 for the first major day-night floodlit cricket match between Essex and West Indies (although organised by Surrey) which was a commercial success; the following year it hosted the final of the inaugural Lambert &amp; Butler county cricket competition. It, however, failed and the experiment of playing cricket on football grounds was ended. Stamford Bridge briefly hosted American football – despite not being long enough for a regulation-size gridiron field – when the London Monarchs were based there in 1997.

===Greyhound racing===
The Greyhound Racing Association (GRA) brought greyhound racing to Stamford Bridge on 31 July 1933 and this forced the London Athletic Club to leave the venue. Totalisator turnover in 1946 was nearly £6 million (£5,749,592); to put this in perspective to football, the British transfer record at the same time in 1946 was £14,500.

On 1 August 1968 the GRA closed Stamford Bridge to greyhound racing quoting the fact that Stamford Bridge had to race on the same days as White City. An attempt by Chelsea to bring back greyhound racing to Stamford Bridge in 1976, to alleviate debts, failed when the GRA refused them permission to do so.

== Structure and facilities ==
The Bridge pitch is surrounded on each side by four covered all-seater stands, officially known as the Matthew Harding Stand (North), East stand, The Shed End (South) and West Stand. Each stand has at least two tiers and was constructed for entirely different reasons as part of separate expansion plans.

===Matthew Harding Stand===
The Matthew Harding Stand, previously known as the North Stand, is along the north edge of the pitch. In 1939, a small two storied North Stand including seating was erected. It was originally intended to span the entire northern end, but the outbreak of World War II and its aftermath compelled the club to keep the stand small. It was demolished and replaced by open terracing for standing supporters in 1976. The North Terrace was closed in 1993 and the present North Stand of two tiers (the Matthew Harding Stand) was then constructed at that end.

It is named after former Chelsea director Matthew Harding, whose investment helped transform the club in the early 1990s before his death in a helicopter accident on 22 October 1996. His investment in the club enabled construction of the stand which was completed in time for the 1996–97 season. It has two tiers and accommodates most season-ticket holders, giving it an excellent atmosphere, especially in the lower tier. Any proposal to enlarge the facility would necessitate demolition of the adjacent Chelsea F.C. Museum and Chelsea Health Club and Spa.

For some Champions League matches, this stand operates at reduced capacity, some entrances being obstructed by the presence of TV outside-broadcast vehicles.

===East Stand===
The only covered stand when Stamford Bridge was renovated into a football ground in 1905, the East Stand had a gabled corrugated iron roof, with around 6,000 seats and a terraced enclosure. The stand remained until 1973, when it was demolished in what was meant to be the opening phase of a comprehensive redevelopment of the stadium. The new stand was opened at the start of the 1974–75 season, but due to the ensuing financial difficulties at the club, it was the only part of the development to be completed.

The East Stand essentially survives in its 1973 three-tiered cantilevered form, although it has been much refurbished and modernised since. It is the heart of the stadium, housing the tunnel, dugout, dressing rooms, conference room, press centre, Audio-Visual and commentary box. The middle tier is occupied by facilities, clubs, and executive suites. The upper tier provides spectators with one of the best views of the pitch and it is the only section to have survived the extensive redevelopment of the 90s. Previously, it was the home to away supporters on the bottom tier. However, at the start of the 2005–06 season, then-manager José Mourinho requested that the family section move to this part of the stand, to boost team morale. Away fans were moved to the Shed End.

===Shed End===

The Shed End is along the south side of the pitch. In 1930, a new terrace was built on the south side, for more standing spectators. It was originally known as the Fulham Road End, but supporters nicknamed it &#x27;The Shed&#x27; and this led the club to officially change its name. It became the most favoured spot for the loudest and most die-hard support, until the terrace was demolished in 1994, when all-seater stadia became compulsory by law as a safety measure in light of the Taylor Report following the Hillsborough disaster. The seated stand which replaced it is still known as the Shed End (see below).

The new stand opened in time for the 1997/98 season. Along with the Matthew Harding Stand, it is an area of the ground where many vocal fans congregate. The view from the upper tier is widely regarded as one of the best in the stadium. The Shed also contains the centenary museum and a memorial wall, where families of deceased fans are able to leave a permanent memorial of their loved ones, indicating their eternal support. A large chunk of the original wall from the back of the Shed End terrace still stands and runs along the south side of the stadium. It has recently been decorated with lights and large images of Chelsea legends. Since 2005, it has been where away supporters are housed; they are allocated 3,000 tickets towards the east side, roughly half of the capacity of the stand.

Peter Osgood&#x27;s ashes were laid to rest under the Shed End penalty spot in 2006.

===West Stand===

In 1964–65, a seated West Stand was built to replace the existing terracing on the west side. Most of the West Stand consisted of rising ranks of wooden tip up seats on iron frames, but seating at the very front was on concrete forms known as &quot;the Benches&quot;. The old West Stand was demolished in 1997 and replaced by the current West Stand. It has three tiers, in addition to a row of executive boxes that stretches the length of the stand.

The lower tier was built on schedule and opened in 1998. However, difficulties with planning permission meant that the stand was not fully completed until 2001. Construction of the stand almost caused another financial crisis, which would have seen the club fall into administration, but for the personal intervention of Roman Abramovich. In borrowing £70m from Eurobonds to finance the project, Ken Bates put Chelsea into a highly perilous financial position, primarily because of the repayment terms he had agreed to.

Now complete, the stand is the primary external &#x27;face&#x27; of the stadium, being the first thing fans see when entering the main gate on Fulham Road. The Main Entrance is flanked by hospitality entrances, formerly named after former Chelsea players Nigel Spackman and David Speedie. Signage at those entrances with those players&#x27; names was removed in 2020, to be replaced by directional signage, meaning those entrances are no longer named after any player. The stand also features the largest concourse area in the stadium, it is also known as the &#x27;Great Hall&#x27; and is used for many functions at Stamford Bridge, including the Chelsea Player of the Year ceremony.

The aforementioned executive boxes, also known as the Millennium Suites, are the home of the majority of matchday hospitality guests. Each box is also named after a former Chelsea player (names in brackets):
* Tambling Suite (Bobby Tambling)
* Clarke Suite (Steve Clarke)
* Harris Suite (Ron Harris)
* &#x27;Drakes&#x27; (Ted Drake)
* Bonetti (Peter Bonetti)
* Hollins (John Hollins)

In October 2010, a nine-foot statue of popular 1960s Chelsea forward Peter Osgood, created by Philip Jackson, was unveiled by Peter&#x27;s widow, Lynn. It is positioned in a recess of the West Stand near the Millennium Reception.

In January 2020, Chelsea FC unveiled a large mural by Solomon Souza on an outside wall of the West Stand of the stadium. The mural is part of Chelsea&#x27;s &#x27;Say No to Antisemitism&#x27; campaign funded by club owner Roman Abramovich. Included on the mural are depictions of footballers Julius Hirsch and Árpád Weisz, who were killed at Auschwitz concentration camp, and Ron Jones, a British prisoner of war known as the &#x27;Goalkeeper of Auschwitz&#x27;.

=== Pitch ===
The Bridge opened in 1877 as a home for the London Athletic Club and was used almost exclusively for that purpose until 1904. Subsequently, with the opening of the football club, the need for a playing surface resulted in the construction of the pitch. In June 2015 significant upgrades were made to the undersoil-heating, drainage, and irrigation systems. Along with the installation a new hybrid grass pitch, this brought the pitch up to modern standards. The current pitch at the ground measures approximately 103 metres (112.6 yd) long by 67 metres (73.2 yd) wide, with a couple metres of run-off space on all sides. The south stand has by far the most run-off space being unto 3.5 metres deep.

==Chelsea Village and surroundings==
When Stamford Bridge was redeveloped in the Ken Bates era, many additional features were added to the complex, including two hotels, apartments, bars, restaurants, the Chelsea Megastore, and an interactive visitor attraction called Chelsea World of Sport. These were completed in August 2001 at a cost of £100 million. The intention was that these facilities would provide extra revenue to support the football side of the business, but they were less successful than hoped, and before the Abramovich takeover in 2003, the debt taken on to finance them was a major burden on the club. Soon after the takeover, a decision was taken to drop the &quot;Chelsea Village&quot; brand and refocus on Chelsea as a football club. However, the stadium is sometimes still referred to as part of Chelsea Village or &quot;The Village&quot;.

===Centenary Museum===
2005 saw the opening of a new club museum, known as the Chelsea Museum or the Centenary Museum, to mark the one hundredth anniversary of the club. The museum is located in the former Shed Galleria. Visitors are able to visit the WAGs lounge and then watch an introductory video message from the former vice-president Richard Attenborough. They are then guided decade by decade through the club&#x27;s history seeing old programmes, past shirts, José Mourinho&#x27;s coat and other memorabilia. A motto on the wall of the museum reads &quot;I am not from the bottle. I am a special one.&quot;, a reference to Mourinho&#x27;s famous quote upon signing as manager for Chelsea.

On 6 June 2011, a new museum with improved and interactive exhibits opened behind the Matthew Harding stand. It is the largest football museum in London.

===Megastore===
The club merchandise shop, known as the Megastore, is situated on the south-west corner of the stadium. The shop has two floors; the ground floor mainly consists of souvenirs and children&#x27;s gear, and the first floor offers mainly apparel, including training jerseys, jackets, coats, and replica team jerseys. There are also two smaller shops, one located at the Stamford Gate entrance and the other inside the new museum building behind the Matthew Harding stand.

==The Stamford Bridge Redevelopment Project==
Former Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich sanctioned redevelopment of Stamford Bridge to around 55,000 to 60,000 seats. Its location in a heavily built-up part of Inner London, in between a main road and two railway lines complicates the logistics of the redevelopment. Additionally, dispersing 60,000 fans into the residential roads surrounding Stamford Bridge is likely to create congestion.

=== Alternative sites ===
Earls Court Exhibition Centre, White City, Battersea Power Station, the Imperial Road Gasworks (off the Kings Road on the Fulham and Chelsea border), and the Chelsea Barracks were alternative sites explored for a stadium rebuild. Under the Chelsea Pitch Owners (CPO) articles of association, the club would however relinquish the name &#x27;Chelsea Football Club&#x27; should it ever move from the site where Stamford Bridge exists. The club proposed to buy back the freehold from CPO. In a vote held on 27 October 2011, its shareholders opted against selling their rights.

On 4 May 2012, Chelsea announced a bid to purchase Battersea Power Station to build a 60,000-seater stadium on the site in conjunction with property developers Almacantar. However the bid was not accepted, and the Battersea Power Station site was redeveloped for residential and commercial uses.

=== Proposed plan ===
On 17 June 2014, the club announced that it had commissioned a study of the area from Fulham Broadway to Stamford Bridge and beyond, by architects Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands. In December 2015, Chelsea announced intention to build a 60,000-seater stadium at Stamford Bridge.

On 5 January 2017, Hammersmith and Fulham council approved the rebuild. The whole of the Chelsea Village development would be demolished and the new stadium would include a new club shop, museum, a bar, and restaurants. The two existing hotels, restaurants, bars and spa would be relocated.

On 6 March 2017, full permission was given to redevelop Stamford Bridge by the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, who said the &quot;high quality and spectacular design&quot; would add to the capital&#x27;s &quot;fantastic array of sporting arenas&quot;.

The Stamford Redevelopment Project encompasses an area of around 12.1 acres (48967 m2). The northern boundaries are formed by Railway lines to the north and the east, while Fulham Road forms the southern boundary. Sir Oswald Stoll Mansions form the western frontier. The club carried out a public consultation in June 2017 to gain feedback about the stadium design. The project is expected to be constructed in a phased manner.

During the rebuild, expected to last 3–4 years, the club would have to find an alternative site to play home games. The Twickenham Stadium emerged as one possible destination, although the RFU stated they have no intentions of bringing football to the stadium. In February 2016, media reports claimed that Chelsea had agreed a £20 million deal with the FA for Wembley Stadium to use it for three seasons beginning in 2017–18. Although, Chelsea wanted exclusive rights to Wembley, the FA suggested that they share stadium with London-rivals Tottenham Hotspur F.C. for just the 2017–18 season, as Spurs were then engaged in their own stadium rebuild. The FA wanted to show no favourites in using the national stadium.

==== Proposed design ====
The stadium rebuild was designed by Swiss architects Herzog &amp; de Meuron, who had previously designed the Allianz Arena in Munich and the Beijing National Stadium.

The Gothic, Westminster Abbey-inspired redesign, envisioned as a &quot;cathedral of football&quot;, prominently features a series of 132 brick piers interlaced with 132 slender steel piers, in reference to the borough&#x27;s Victorian-era brick works, that extend over the roof and end in a circular white steel ring right above the pitch. The piers create a covered walkway around the perimeter of the premises.

The unusual faceted polygon shape of the stadium accommodates site constraints such as neighbouring properties, rights to light, rails, historic boundary walls, whilst maximising its interior space. With five levels above ground and three basement levels, and five general admission entrances and four hospitality entrances to a three-tiered spacious spectator bowl across four stands, the rebuild&#x27;s principal emphasis is on match-day atmosphere and spectator experience; including views of the pitch from all seats in the stadium, easier stadium access, and the season-ticket holders keeping their respective seating positions. A pair of continuous &#x27;inner&#x27; and &#x27;outer&#x27; rings occupying approximately 60,000 m around the bowl houses concourse facilities like dining areas, kiosks, washrooms, kitchens, and first-aid rooms. The façade, made up of 264 piers, is left open or is covered with opaque panels and translucent glass. The front panels feature decorative architectural metal known as Crozier. The public plazas are augmented by an additional 23,000 m through covering of the railway lines bordering its perimeter. According to the architects, the design is intended to &quot;capture the spirit of the local heritage in a contemporary sculpted form that will respond to the local townscape [...] The structure will have a lightness of expression when viewed directly but also a solidity and textural materiality when seen obliquely&quot;.

Involving excavation activities and demolition of the existing stadium and the associated buildings, the rebuild, touted as &quot;one of the most ambitious and difficult builds in architectural history&quot;, is expected to cost $754 million. Herzog &amp; de Meuron, redesigned the stadium based on the master-plan drafted by Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands, while Aecom provided environmental, fire, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing engineering and were also landscape architects. Parsons Brinckerhoff and Schlaich Bergermann Partner worked on its structural and civil engineering aspects.

==== Legal hurdles ====
In May 2017, the Crosthwaites family, whose house is sited opposite the East Stand, launched legal proceedings in the form of an injunction, in order to prevent Chelsea from expanding Stamford Bridge. The family&#x27;s argument was that further building at the stadium would block out their natural light. Chelsea attempted to offer them legal advice worth £50,000, and further compensation understood to be in the region of a six-figure sum, in exchange for waiving their legal right to light in their home. The club then sought the help of the local authority, Hammersmith &amp; Fulham Council, in order to continue with the Stamford Bridge Redevelopment Project. In January 2018 the council sided with the club, by planning to use its powers under planning law to buy the air rights over part of Stamford Bridge and the railway line which sits between the stadium and the affected homes. It would then lease the land back to Chelsea and railway operators Network Rail, meaning the Crosthwaites would be entitled to compensation but would not be able to prevent the redevelopment.

=== Suspension ===
On 31 May 2018, the club announced suspension of the rebuild stating, &quot;Chelsea Football Club announces today that it has put its new stadium project on hold. No further pre-construction design and planning work will occur. [...] The club does not have a time frame set for reconsideration of its decision. The decision was made due to the current unfavourable investment climate.&quot;

=== New plan===
In July 2022, it was reported that the club&#x27;s new owner Todd Boehly had appointed American architect Janet Marie Smith to oversee the renovation of the stadium. In July 2023, it was reported that Chelsea had agreed a deal to buy the majority of the 1.2 acre Sir Oswald Stoll Mansions site between Stamford Bridge and Fulham Broadway tube station for the stadium redevelopment.

==Statistics==

===Records===
* Record attendance: 82,905 v Arsenal F.C. on 12 October 1935
* Lowest attendance: 3,000 V Lincoln City, Second Division, 17 February 1906 (During COVID: 2,000 v Leeds United, Premier League, 5 December 2020)

===Average attendances===
==Access==
Stamford Bridge is easily accessible by public transport. The closest London Underground station – Fulham Broadway – has a dedicated &quot;match day&quot; entrance, allowing crowds easier entry/exit from the station, avoiding the main ticket hall and shopping centre. Given the stadium&#x27;s location in south west London, car parking in the local area is extremely limited – and therefore the use of public transport is recommended by Chelsea FC and local supporter groups.

<text>In organic chemistry, a carbamate is a category of organic compounds with the general formula and structure , which are formally derived from carbamic acid (). The term includes organic compounds (e.g., the ester ethyl carbamate), formally obtained by replacing one or more of the hydrogen atoms by other organic functional groups; as well as salts with the carbamate anion (e.g. ammonium carbamate).

Polymers whose repeat units are joined by carbamate like groups are an important family of plastics, the polyurethanes. See for clarification.

==Properties==
While carbamic acids are unstable, many carbamate esters and salts are stable and well known.

===Equilibrium with carbonate and bicarbonate===
In water solutions, the carbamate anion slowly equilibrates with the ammonium cation and the carbonate or bicarbonate anions:
: 

Calcium carbamate is soluble in water, whereas calcium carbonate is not. Adding a calcium salt to an ammonium carbamate/carbonate solution will precipitate some calcium carbonate immediately, and then slowly precipitate more as the carbamate hydrolyzes.

==Synthesis==
===Carbamate salts===
The salt ammonium carbamate is generated by treatment of ammonia with carbon dioxide:
:2 NH3 + CO2 → NH4[H2NCO2]

===Carbamate esters===
Carbamate esters also arise via alcoholysis of carbamoyl chlorides:
:R2NC(O)Cl + R&#x27;OH → R2NCO2R&#x27; + HCl
Alternatively, carbamates can be formed from chloroformates and amines:
:R&#x27;OC(O)Cl + R2NH → R2NCO2R&#x27; + HCl
Carbamates may be formed from the Curtius rearrangement, where isocyanates formed are reacted with an alcohol.
:RCON3 → RNCO + N2
:RNCO + R′OH → RNHCO2R′

==Natural occurrence==
Within nature carbon dioxide can bind with neutral amine groups to form a carbamate, this post-translational modification is known as carbamylation. This modification is known to occur on several important proteins; see examples below.

===Hemoglobin===
The N-terminal amino groups of valine residues in the α- and β-chains of deoxyhemoglobin exist as carbamates. They help to stabilise the protein when it becomes deoxyhemoglobin, and increases the likelihood of the release of remaining oxygen molecules bound to the protein. This stabilizing effect should not be confused with the Bohr effect (an indirect effect caused by carbon dioxide).

===Urease and phosphotriesterase===
The ε-amino groups of the lysine residues in urease and phosphotriesterase also feature carbamate. The carbamate derived from aminoimidazole is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of inosine. Carbamoyl phosphate is generated from carboxyphosphate
rather than CO2.

===CO2 capture by ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase===
Perhaps the most prevalent carbamate is the one involved in the capture of CO2 by plants. This process is necessary for their growth. The enzyme ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) fixes a molecule of carbon dioxide as phosphoglycerate in the Calvin cycle. At the active site of the enzyme, a Mg2+ ion is bound to glutamate and aspartate residues as well as a lysine carbamate. The carbamate is formed when an uncharged lysine side chain near the ion reacts with a carbon dioxide molecule from the air (&quot;not&quot; the substrate carbon dioxide molecule), which then renders it charged, and, therefore, able to bind the Mg2+ ion.
==Applications==
===Synthesis of urea===
Although not usually isolated as such, the salt ammonium carbamate is produced on a large scale as an intermediate in the production of the commodity chemical urea from ammonia and carbon dioxide.

===Polyurethane plastics===

Polyurethanes contain multiple carbamate groups as part of their structure. The &quot;urethane&quot; in the name &quot;polyurethane&quot; refers to these carbamate groups; the term &quot;urethane links&quot; describe how carbamates polymerize. In contrast, the substance commonly called &quot;urethane&quot;, ethyl carbamate, is neither a component of polyurethanes, nor is it used in their manufacture. Urethanes are usually formed by reaction of an alcohol with an isocyanate. Commonly, urethanes made by a non-isocyanate route are called carbamates.

Polyurethane polymers have a wide range of properties and are commercially available as foams, elastomers, and solids. Typically, polyurethane polymers are made by combining diisocyanates, e.g. toluene diisocyanate, and diols, where the carbamate groups are formed by reaction of the alcohols with the isocyanates:
:RN=C=O + R′OH → RNHC(O)OR′

===Carbamate insecticides===

The so-called carbamate insecticides feature the carbamate ester functional group. Included in this group are aldicarb (Temik), carbofuran (Furadan), carbaryl (Sevin), ethienocarb, fenobucarb, oxamyl, and methomyl. These insecticides kill insects by reversibly inactivating the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE inhibition) (IRAC mode of action 1a). The organophosphate pesticides also inhibit this enzyme, although irreversibly, and cause a more severe form of cholinergic poisoning (the similar IRAC MoA 1b).

Fenoxycarb has a carbamate group but acts as a juvenile hormone mimic, rather than inactivating acetylcholinesterase.

The insect repellent icaridin is a substituted carbamate.

Besides their common use as arthropodocides/insecticides, they are also nematicidal. One such is Oxamyl.

Sales have declined dramatically over recent decades.

====Resistance====
Among mutations in esterases, carbamate resistance most commonly involves acetylcholinesterase (AChE) desensitization, while organophosphate resistance most commonly is carboxylesterase metabolization.

===Carbamate nerve agents===
While the carbamate acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are commonly referred to as &quot;carbamate insecticides&quot; due to their generally high selectivity for insect acetylcholinesterase enzymes over the mammalian versions, the most potent compounds such as aldicarb and carbofuran are still capable of inhibiting mammalian acetylcholinesterase enzymes at low enough concentrations that they pose a significant risk of poisoning to humans, especially when used in large amounts for agricultural applications. Other carbamate based acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are known with even higher toxicity to humans, and some such as T-1123 and EA-3990 were investigated for potential military use as nerve agents. However, since all compounds of this type have a quaternary ammonium group with a permanent positive charge, they have poor blood–brain barrier penetration, and also are only stable as crystalline salts or aqueous solutions, and so were not considered to have suitable properties for weaponisation.

===Preservatives and cosmetics===
Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate is a wood and paint preservative and used in cosmetics.

===Chemical research===
Some of the most common amine protecting groups, such as Boc, Fmoc, benzyl chloroformate and trichloroethyl chloroformate are carbamates.

===Medicine===
====Ethyl carbamate====
Urethane (ethyl carbamate) was once produced commercially in the United States as a chemotherapy agent and for other medicinal purposes. It was found to be toxic and largely ineffective. It is occasionally used in veterinary medicine in combination with other drugs to produce anesthesia.

====Carbamate drugs====
In addition, some carbamates are used in human pharmacotherapy, for example, the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors neostigmine and rivastigmine, whose chemical structure is based on the natural alkaloid physostigmine. Other examples are meprobamate and its derivatives like carisoprodol, felbamate, mebutamate, phenprobamate, and tybamate, a class of anxiolytic and muscle relaxant drugs widely used in the 1960s before the rise of benzodiazepines, and still used nowadays in some cases. Carbachol is primarily used for various ophthalmic purposes.

The protease inhibitor darunavir for HIV treatment also contains a carbamate functional group.

Ephedroxane, an aminorex analogue used as a stimulant, also falls into the carbamate category.

==Toxicity==

Besides inhibiting human acetylcholinesterase (although to a lesser degree than the insect enzyme), carbamate insecticides also target human melatonin receptors. The human health effects of carbamates are well documented in the list of known endocrine disruptor compounds. Clinical effects of carbamate exposure can vary from slightly toxic to highly toxic depending on a variety of factors including such as dose and route of exposure with ingestion and inhalation resulting in the most rapid clinical effects. These clinical manifestations of carbamate intoxication are muscarinic signs, nicotinic signs, and in rare cases central nervous system signs.

==Sulfur analogues==
There are two oxygen atoms in a carbamate (1), ROC(=O)NR2, and either or both of them can be conceptually replaced by sulfur. Analogues of carbamates with only one of the oxygens replaced by sulfur are called thiocarbamates (2 and 3). Carbamates with both oxygens replaced by sulfur are called dithiocarbamates (4), RSC(=S)NR2.

There are two different structurally isomeric types of thiocarbamate:
*&quot;O&quot;-thiocarbamates (2), ROC(=S)NR2, where the carbonyl group (C=O) is replaced with a thiocarbonyl group (C=S)
*&quot;S&quot;-thiocarbamates (3), RSC(=O)NR2, where the R–O– group is replaced with an R–S– group

&quot;O&quot;-thiocarbamates can isomerise to &quot;S&quot;-thiocarbamates, for example in the Newman–Kwart rearrangement.
== Etymology ==
The etymology of the words &quot;urethane&quot; and &quot;carbamate&quot; are highly similar but not the same. The word &quot;urethane&quot; was first coined in 1833 by French chemist Jean-Baptiste Dumas. Dumas states &quot;Urethane. The new ether, brought into contact with liquid and concentrated ammonia, exerts on this substance a reaction so strong that the mixture boils, and sometimes even produces a sort of explosion. If the ammonia is in excess, all the ether disappears. It forms ammonium hydrochlorate and a new substance endowed with interesting properties.&quot; Dumas appears to be naming this compound urethane. However, later Dumas states &quot;While waiting for opinion to settle on the nature of this body, I propose to designate by the names of urethane and oxamethane the two materials which I have just studied, and &quot;which I regard as types of a new family, among nitrogenous substances&quot;. These names which, in my eyes, do not prejudge anything in the question of alcohol and ethers, will at least have the advantage of satisfying chemists who still refuse to accept our theory.&quot; The word urethane is derived from the words &quot;urea&quot; and &quot;ether&quot; with the suffix &quot;-ane&quot; as a generic chemical suffix, making it specific for the R2NC(=O)OR&#x27; (R&#x27; not = H) bonding structure.

The use of the word &quot;carbamate&quot; appears to come later only being traced back to at least 1849, in a description of Dumas&#x27;s work by Henry Medlock. Medlock states &quot;It is well known that the action of ammonia on chloro-carbonate (phosgene) of ethyl gives rise to the formation of the substance which Dumas, the discoverer, called urethane, and which we are now in the habit of considering as the ether of carbamic acid.&quot; This suggests that instead of continuing with the urethane family naming convention Dumas coined, they altered the naming convention to ethyl ether of carbamic acid. Carbamate is derived from the words &quot;carbamide&quot;, otherwise known as urea, and &quot;-ate&quot; a suffix which indicates the salt or ester of an acid.

Both words have roots deriving from urea. Carbamate is less-specific because the -ate suffix is ambiguous for either the salt or ester of a carbamic acid. However, the -ate suffix is also more specific because it suggests carbamates must be derived from the acid of carbamate, or carbamic acids&quot;.&quot; Although, a urethane has the same chemical structure as a carbamate ester moiety, a urethane not derived from a carbamic acid is not a carbamate ester. In other words, any synthesis of the R2NC(=O)OR&#x27; (R&#x27; not = H) moiety that &quot;does not derive from carbamic acids&quot; is not a carbamate ester but instead a urethane. Furthermore, carbamate esters are urethanes but not all urethanes are carbamate esters. This further suggests that polyurethanes are not simply polycarbamate-esters because polyurethanes are not typically synthesized using carbamic acids.

IUPAC states &quot;The esters are often called urethanes or urethans, a usage that is strictly correct only for the ethyl esters.&quot; But also states, &quot;An alternative term for the compounds R2NC(=O)OR&#x27; (R&#x27; not = H), esters of carbamic acids, R,NC(=O)OH, in strict use limited to the ethyl esters, but widely used in the general sense&quot;. IUPAC provides these statements without citation.

<doc id="666473" wikidata="Q743673" url="?curid=666473" title="Mel Powell">
<text>Mel Powell (born Melvin Epstein) (February 12, 1923 – April 24, 1998) was an American Pulitzer Prize-winning composer, and the founding dean of the music department at the California Institute of the Arts. He served as a music educator for over 40 years, first at Mannes College of Music and Queens College, then Yale University, and finally at CalArts. During his early career he worked as a jazz pianist. His classic Big Band compositions include &quot;Mission to Moscow&quot;, &quot;My Guy&#x27;s Come Back&quot;, &quot;Clarinade&quot;, &quot;The Earl&quot;, and &quot;Bubble Bath&quot;.

==Early life==
Mel Powell was born Melvin D. Epstein on February 12, 1923, in The Bronx, New York City, the second of Russian Jewish parents Milton Epstein and Mildred (Mollie) Mark Epstein&#x27;s three children. He began playing piano at age four, taking lessons from, among others, Nadia Reisenberg. A passionate baseball fan, his home was within sight of Yankee Stadium. A hand injury while playing baseball as a boy, however, convinced him to pursue music instead of sports as a career. Powell dreamed of life as a concert pianist until his older brother took him to see jazz pianist Teddy Wilson play, and later to a concert featuring Benny Goodman. In a 1987 interview with &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine Powell said &quot;I had never heard anything as ecstatic as this music&quot;, prompting a shift from classical to jazz piano. By the age of 14 Powell was performing jazz professionally around New York City. As early as 1939, he was working with Bobby Hackett, George Brunies, and Zutty Singleton, as well as writing arrangements for Earl Hines. He changed his last name from Epstein to Powell in 1941 shortly before joining Benny Goodman&#x27;s band.

==Career==

Powell&#x27;s style was rooted in the stride style that was the direct precursor to swing piano. One composition from his Goodman years, &quot;The Earl&quot;, is perhaps his best known from that time. The song—dedicated to Earl &quot;Fatha&quot; Hines, one of Powell&#x27;s piano heroes—was recorded without a drummer. After nearly two years with Goodman, Powell played briefly with the CBS radio band under director Raymond Scott. During World War II, Powell was drafted into the U.S. Army, but fought his battles from a piano stool, having been assigned to Glenn Miller&#x27;s Army Air Force Band from 1943 to 1945.

Near the war&#x27;s end, Powell was stationed in Paris, where he played with Django Reinhardt, and then returned for a brief stint in Goodman&#x27;s band again after being discharged from the military. In the mid-to-late 1940s, Powell moved to Hollywood and ventured into providing music for movies and cartoons, such as the &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; shorts. He played himself in the movie &quot;A Song Is Born&quot; (1948), appearing along with many other famous jazz players, including Louis Armstrong, Tommy Dorsey and Benny Goodman. It was during his time in Hollywood that he met and married actress Martha Scott.

Shortly thereafter, Powell developed muscular dystrophy. He was reliant on a wheelchair for some time, then walked with aid of a cane. The illness effectively ended his ability to work as a traveling musician again with Goodman or other bands, prompting him to devote himself to composition rather than performance. In 1948 he enrolled at the Yale School of Music, where he studied with German composer and music theorist Paul Hindemith and received a B.M. degree in 1952. In 1954, he recorded the jazz album &quot;Thigamigig&quot;, including a piano/trumpet/drums track that was selected by Art Clokey for his claymation short &quot;Gumbasia&quot; in 1955. Also in 1954, he appeared with Benny Goodman in New York at Basin Street for a three-week engagement.

===Changing styles, careers===
At first sticking to neoclassical styles of composition, Powell increasingly explored atonality, or &quot;non-tonal&quot; music as he called it, as well as the serialism advocated by Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg. After receiving his degree, Powell embarked on a career as a music educator, first at Mannes College of Music and Queens College in his native New York City, then returning to Yale in 1958, succeeding Hindemith as chair of the composition faculty and director of one of the nation&#x27;s first electronic music studios. Powell composed several electronic pieces in the 1960s, some of which were performed at the Electric Circus in New York&#x27;s East Village, a venue that also saw performances by groundbreaking rock music acts like the Velvet Underground and the Grateful Dead. But Powell did not completely turn his back on jazz. While teaching in the 1950s, he also played piano and recorded music with Benny Goodman again, as well as on his own.

Powell composed for orchestra, chorus, voice, and chamber ensemble throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. In 1969, he returned to California to serve as founding dean of the School of Music of the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia. After serving as Provost of the institute from 1972 to 1976, he was appointed the Roy O. Disney Professor of Music, and taught at the Institute until shortly before his death. Notable students include the composers Ann Millikan and Anthony Brandt. 

==Later years==
In 1987, Powell joined other musicians for a jazz festival on the cruise ship &quot;SS Norway&quot;, playing alongside Benny Carter, Howard Alden, Milt Hinton, Louie Bellson and others. One performance has been documented on the CD &quot;The Return of Mel Powell&quot; (Chiaroscuro Records). The recording includes 20 minutes of Powell discussing his life and his reasons for leaving jazz. In an interview with &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine jazz critic Whitney Balliett, Powell said: &quot;I have decided that when I retire I will think through my decision to leave jazz – with the help of Freud and Jung. At the moment, I suspect it was this: I had done what I felt I had to do in jazz. I had decided it did not hold the deepest interest for me musically. And I had decided that it was a young man&#x27;s music, even a black music. Also, the endless repetition of material in the Goodman band – playing the same tunes day after day and night after night – got to me. That repetition tended to kill spontaneity, which is the heart of jazz and which can give a lifetime&#x27;s nourishment.&quot;

===Pulitzer Prize===
In 1990, Powell received his highest career achievement, the Pulitzer Prize for Music, for his work &quot;&quot;. In a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; interview, Powell expressed complete surprise: &quot;Being out here on the coast, far away from the whole Eastern establishment to which the Pulitzer is connected – that made me a remote prospect. I just didn&#x27;t expect it.&quot; In an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Powell related the story of how &quot;Duplicates&quot; came from his service in World War II and an anecdote he heard in Paris about Claude Debussy&#x27;s search for perfect music. That, Powell, stated was his goal for &quot;Duplicates&quot;. The work, commissioned in 1987 for the Los Angeles Philharmonic by music patron Betty Freeman, took Powell more than two years to complete. It was made even more difficult as his muscular dystrophy, previously affecting only his legs, began to afflict his arms and thus his ability to play the piano.

Besides the Pulitzer, Powell&#x27;s awards and honors include the Creative Arts Medal from Brandeis University, a Guggenheim Fellowship, an honorary life membership in the Arnold Schoenberg Institute, a commission from the Koussevitzky Music Foundation for the Library of Congress, and a National Institute of Arts and Letters grant.

==Death==

Powell died at his home in Sherman Oaks, California, on April 24, 1998, from liver cancer. He was 75 years old. Powell was survived by his wife, actress Martha Scott, two daughters and a stepson. He was buried in the Masonic Cemetery in his wife&#x27;s hometown of Jamesport, Missouri.

==Quotes==
* On his days in big band/swing music: &quot;It&#x27;s really so long ago, one ought to be able to invoke a statute of limitations. I played with Benny Goodman for two years, and I&#x27;ve been composing for 40. At the time, swing music, big-band music and Benny Goodman in particular were so boundlessly popular that people who made room for it in their lives have never forgotten it. So I get calls from people who are in a kind of time warp, who ask me about this period of my life as though it were the present. But I&#x27;ve moved on to other things.&quot;
* &quot;The musician&#x27;s business is structure...The musician...is...therefore drawn to a profound science of structure. Looking closely at music itself, he is likely to ask: &quot;What changes? When? By how much?&quot;...he is...able to feel at home where logicians exhibit techniques for &quot;isolating relevant structure.&quot;
* &quot;It is true that the music I traffic in, along with Milton Babbitt, Elliott Carter and others, has never gained a great popularity. But that was true of the so-called difficult music of earlier centuries, too. And I must say that I have noticed, as we have held our ground, that there has been a softening of response. There are now those who are beginning to find expressive beauty in a music that was at first rejected entirely.&quot;

<doc id="666474" wikidata="Q2568281" url="?curid=666474" title="Thodupuzha">
<text>Thodupuzha () is a small city and municipality and taluk in the Idukki district of Kerala, India. It is located west of the district headquarters in Painavu and about north of the state capital Thiruvananthapuram. As per the 2011 Indian census, Thodupuzha has a population of 52,045 people, and a population density of .

Thodupuzha is the largest town and main commercial centre in Idukki. It is bordered by the Kottayam district on the southern side and the Ernakulam District on the western side. It also acts as a gateway to various tourist spots in the High Range regions towards its east, including Munnar, Thekkady, and Peermade.

== Etymology ==
In retribution to the destruction the then capital of &quot;Vadakkaumkoor&quot; principality, &quot;Karikkode&quot;, by Diwan Ramayyan and his ally Yesthacius De Lenoy on the annexation of Vadakkumkoor, by the orders of Maharajah of Travancore, His Highness Anizham Thirunal Marthandavarma, sent his representative to manage as administer of invaded principality of Vadakkumkoor, Elasamprathi Narayana Varma. A nearby area, then named &quot;Kodanthuruth&quot; surrounded by a number of hillocks and rocky areas was selected by the representative of Maharajah of Travancore, to be the new headquarters of the Thodupuzha Taluk. Karikkode was reduced to a petty village as a &quot;Pakuthy&quot;. Maharajah also appointed and entrusted Mallan Sankaran of Palliyadi, his Surveyor, for the preparation of land revenue records(&quot;&quot;Ozhukku&quot;and survey and settlement of Kandezhuthu. As Mallan Sankaran failed to execute his mission due to widespread objection and riot of the local people, survey was only completed during the reign of Karthikathirunal Ramavarma. The place was named &quot;Thodupuzha&quot; by the Raja of Vadakkumkoor Maluvakon Manikantan who used to reside in his palace at Vaickam and Edavetty(Mattam Palace) near Karikkode, used to mention the nearby flowing wide &quot;Valiyathodu&quot; as &quot;thodu&quot; () &quot;puzha&quot; (). It is believed that the stream developed into a river due to the changes in geophysical conditions of the area wherefrom it originates and enter the vally of Arakulam, to be known as Thodupuzha river and the town on the banks of the river came to be known as Thodupuzha. There is another version that defines &quot;thodu&quot; as &quot;touch&quot; instead. The Mattathil Kovilakam were the protectors and rulers of the region. The last ruler of the region was Elasamprathi Narayana Varma, who originally came from Trivandrum and was the representative of Maharaja of Travancore Anizhamthirunal Marthanda Varma.

== History ==
The Vadakkumkur kings used to live in Karikode for several years. Vadakkumkur was a late medieval/early modern feudal principality located in Kerala. After the kingdom separated, Thekkumkur became an independent kingdom, while Vadakkumkur became a vassal of Cochin. During the time of Portuguese dominance in Cochin, disputes arose between the Vadakkumkur chieftain and the Kingdom of Cochin over the pepper trade, and the Vadakkumkur &quot;raja&quot; was killed in battle with Cochin and their Portuguese allies. After the attack, Vadakkumkur palace split into two branches: one was known as Mattathil Palace, which remained in Thondikkuzha; and the other one in Kadanadu Pala. Vadakkumkur and Thekkumkur were later annexed by Marthanda Varma and incorporated into the kingdom of Travancore. Maharaja appointed his representative known as Elasamprathi Narayana Varam to develop the region called Keezhmalainadu. Varam became known as the father of Keezhmalainadu and modern Thodupuzha.

Varam erected many monuments, including the government offices, Pandikasala, and temples. The Karikode mosque and other buildings in Thodupuzha and Muvattupuzha also date from his reign. He was the founder of the new style of tax collection in this region. Thodupuzha is an ancient town with a history dating back to many centuries. The Buddhist and Jain religions which made their first inroads into Kerala in 300 BC left their influence at Thodupuzha and neighboring areas. In the 14th century, Kerala was divided for administrative reasons into several provinces: Venadu, Otanadu, Navishainadu, Munjunadu, Vempolinadu, and Keezhmalainadu. Thodupuzha and Muvattupuzha were in Keezhmalainadu, which was in existence until 1600; in that year it lost a battle with Vadakkumkoor and became a part of it.

<text>New Utrecht () was a town in western Long Island, New York encompassing all or part of the present-day Bath Beach, Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst, Borough Park, Dyker Heights and Fort Hamilton neighborhoods of Brooklyn, New York City. New Utrecht was established in 1652 by Dutch settlers in the Dutch colony of New Netherland, the last of the original six towns to be founded in Kings County. New Utrecht ceased to exist in 1894 when it was annexed by the City of Brooklyn, and became part of the City of Greater New York when Brooklyn joined as a borough in 1898.

==History==

===Dutch settlement===

In 1643, Anthony Janszoon van Salee, a half-Dutch, half-Moroccan son of a pirate, and a resident of New Amsterdam, obtained from the Director General of New Netherland a patent on a tract of land of more than 200 acres on western Long Island. It ran along the shore of the Bay opposite Staten Island. Most of the land was undeveloped until 1652, when Cornelius van Werckhoven took it over. A surveyor, Werckhoven was born in Utrecht in the Netherlands, and became a principal investor in the Dutch West India Company. Upon Van Werckhoven&#x27;s death in 1655, Jacques Cortelyou, guardian for Werckhoven&#x27;s children, received permission to sell lots of the land to create a town. Twenty lots were laid out. Cortelyou named the settlement &quot;Nieuw Utrecht&quot; after Werckhoven&#x27;s hometown.

Nicasius de Sille, an attorney from Arnhem, Gelderland, was one of the first to purchase a lot. He built a house using locally available stone, topped with red roof tiles imported from the Netherlands. He moved to New Utrecht from his former residence in New Amsterdam, at the lower part of the island near the current intersection of Broad Street and Exchange Place. De Sille served as an advisor to Governor Petrus Stuyvesant and as a &quot;schout fiscal&quot;, a combination of sheriff and district attorney. In 1660, de Sille completed a &quot;List of the Inhabitants of New Amsterdam&quot;, at the behest of Stuyvesant. The names and addresses on the list correspond to the houses drawn on the Castello Plan.

Once a defensive palisade wall was erected around the town of New Utrecht on western Long Island, more residents settled there. In 1657, New Utrecht was granted status as a village, and in 1661 Governor Peter Stuyvesant provided New Utrecht its own charter. New Netherland was taken over by the English in 1664, who changed its name to the Province of New York.

The Bensons were among the original Dutch settlers in New Utrecht. Other early families in the town include di Sille, Van Pelt, Cropsey, and Nostrand. Cropsey Avenue and Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn are named for the latter two founding families.

What is called the Van Pelt Manor House was built in stages. The first section, of stone, was built by Jan Van Cleef (Cleve) around 1675 and later sold to Nicholas de Meyer, who sold it to Teunis Van Pelt. An agreement with de Meyer allowed Van Cleef to live in the dwelling from 1691 until his death c. 1699. Around 1686, the house was enlarged and a second floor was added. Van Pelt&#x27;s land was never established in deed nor granted the status of &quot;Manor&quot;.

===New Utrecht Cemetery and Reformed Church===
Initially, the residents in New Utrecht went to Flatbush for Dutch Reformed religious services. But they created New Utrecht Cemetery in 1654. In 1677, they chartered New Utrecht Reformed Church to provide for a local congregation. They built their first church in 1700. The second (and current) church was built in the 1830s, using bricks from the first church. It has been designated as a National Historic Landmark, as has the cemetery.

In 1856, yellow fever spread from Staten Island to the inhabitants of Bay Ridge and Fort Hamilton in western Long Island. The New Utrecht Cemetery contains a monument, erected in 1910, to honor Dr. James E. DuBois and his assistant Dr. John L. Crane, who died fighting the outbreak. The church received landmark status in 1966; the parish house and the cemetery received landmark status in 1998. Both the church and the cemetery are listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

===New Utrecht in Kings County===
In 1683, when the English established Kings County within the Province of New York, New Utrecht was one of its six original towns. It came to encompass the villages of New Utrecht, Bath, Fort Hamilton and Bay Ridge. Town records were kept in the Dutch language until 1763. That year the British defeated France in the Seven Years&#x27; War and took over its territory in North America east of the Mississippi River. They asserted their power in New York as well, requiring records to be in English.

===Revolutionary War===
During the American Revolution, the British made New Utrecht their base of operations for the Battle of Long Island. The old Cortelyou mansion served as General Howe&#x27;s headquarters after he landed on Long Island in August 1776. The British brought the mortally wounded American General Nathaniel Woodhull to the Nicasius di Sille house for treatment. The house was demolished in 1850.)

The bluff on which Fort Hamilton was built in the 1820s was occupied at this time by the houses of Denyse Denyse, Abraham Bennett, and Simon Cortelyou. In the bombardment from the British ships, on August 26, 1776, the Bennett and Denyse dwellings were struck by their shots. From 1776 to the end of the British occupation, sympathizers with the Patriot cause traveled by fishing boats at night across The Narrows to meet with compatriots in Staten Island and New Jersey.

During the War of 1812, the US Army began construction of a fort on Hendrick&#x27;s Reef, an island offshore the southern tip of what is now Bay Ridge. Originally named Fort Diamond, it was renamed as Fort Lafayette in 1825 to honor the Marquis de La Fayette, a hero of the American Revolution. Construction of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge required the destruction of this fort in 1960. The Brooklyn-side bridge pillars now occupy the fort&#x27;s former foundation site.

A literary club called the &quot;Winter Society&quot; founded the Free Library of the Town of New Utrecht in 1894.

New Utrecht was annexed by the City of Brooklyn on July 1, 1894. It became part of the consolidated City of New York on January 1, 1898.

==After city unification==
The area that encompassed the town center of New Utrecht is located in what is now Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. Eighty-fourth Street between Sixteenth and Eighteenth avenues approximates the main thoroughfare of the town. The rest of the town&#x27;s lands are today the neighborhoods of Borough Park, which has a large Hasidic Jewish population, and Bay Ridge. In the 18th century, Bay Ridge was known as Yellow Hook. The name was changed after several outbreaks of yellow fever that struck the New York area in the 19th century.

<text>The Northstar Line is a commuter rail route in the US state of Minnesota. Northstar runs from Big Lake to downtown Minneapolis at Target Field using existing track and right-of-way owned by the BNSF Railway. Passenger service began on November 16, 2009. The rail line serves part of the Northstar Corridor between Minneapolis and St. Cloud. Planning for the line began in 1997 when the Northstar Corridor Development Authority (NCDA) was formed. The corridor is also served by Interstate 94 and U.S. Highway 10. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

== Background ==
The route was initially designed to run the full distance between Minneapolis and Rice, Minnesota, northwest of St. Cloud. The project was counting on federal funding for half of its construction costs. The estimated ridership for the full route was not high enough to qualify for that much needed federal funding.

When the line was first proposed, then-Governor Jesse Ventura was an early advocate and convinced some people to come around to his point of view. Ventura&#x27;s successor, Governor Tim Pawlenty, did not initially support it. He changed his mind after MnDOT determined that a scaled-back version of the line would qualify for federal funding.

The 2004 Minnesota Legislative session did not pass a bonding bill, which meant a lack of funds for initial project work. Some counties in the area and the Metropolitan Council came up with matching funds to allow funding from the United States federal government to continue.

During the 2005 state legislative session, a bonding bill including $37.5 million of funding for the proposed project was passed. The bill was signed on April 11, 2005, by Governor Tim Pawlenty at the site of the Riverdale station in Coon Rapids. The 2006 state legislature, along with city, county and federal governments, provided funding to complete the corridor to Big Lake.

Construction began on the maintenance facility near Big Lake station and on the Blue Line light rail extension in September 2007, before full funding for the line had been secured. On December 11, 2007, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Transportation Thomas Barrett met with Governor Pawlenty in Anoka County and officially signed a Full Funding Grant Agreement of $156.8 million, nearly half of the funding for the $317 million, line from Minneapolis to Big Lake. The money enabled the release of an additional $97.5 million in state bonding money set aside for the project.

The federal government paid $156.8 million, the state paid $98.6 million and the Anoka County Regional Rail Authority pledged $34.8 million. The remaining partners were Sherburne County Regional Rail Authority ($8.2 million), Hennepin County Regional Rail Authority ($8 million), the Metropolitan Council ($5.9 million) and the Minnesota Twins ($2.6 million, for the station improvements under the new Target Field where the Minneapolis station was constructed). Of the $317 million total, $107.5 million went to paying BNSF for a perpetual easement for track rights and facilities along the line and to pay the BNSF employees that operate the trains. The operating budget for the first full year of service, 2010, was $16.8 million.

== Construction and operation ==

The Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) and the Northstar Corridor Development Authority (NCDA) studied options for development of the corridor to handle the increasing commuter load and felt that a commuter rail line was the best option. It was expected to cost about US$265 million in 2008 dollars, estimated to be less than one-third the cost of upgrading existing highways, though the cost would later climb to $317 million. Because almost all of the route being used already existed, the investment mostly went into building new stations, upgrading track, enhancing the safety of crossings, and updating signals. A significant portion of the funds were to extend the METRO Blue Line to the Target Field station on the west side of Interstate 394 and 5th Street in downtown Minneapolis. This terminal station is integrated into the Minnesota Twins&#x27; new ballpark, Target Field, which opened in March 2010.

During normal operation, the line had six trains running in the morning and evening rush hour periods, and limited service on weekends and holidays. Bus feeder lines, including the Northstar Link from St. Cloud to Big Lake station, bring residents along the corridor to the nearest train station. Once in downtown, commuters can walk upstairs to the METRO Blue and Green Lines, take a bus into other areas of the city, or go into one of the nearby buildings integrated into the Minneapolis skyway system. In the first year, 2010, Metro Ridership fell well short of its goal of 3,400 weekday trips from this station. Metro Transit has a goal for of 5,900 by 2030 intending to save those commuters 900,000 hours over the course of a year when compared to taking a dedicated bus line.

From its opening until January 2014, Northstar trains arrived on time for 96 percent of trips making it one of the most reliable services from Metro Transit. Starting in the winter of 2014, on-time performance suffered due to heavy freight traffic and severe cold weather. By the end of February 2014, on-time reliability was down to 74 percent. Freight traffic from the North Dakota oil boom contributed to congestion and delays for trains. The delays were also felt by the Amtrak &quot;Empire Builder&quot; route which travels through the same corridor. Delays were severe enough for legislators to hold a public hearing at the State Capitol with BNSF in attendance. During the hearing, BNSF stated that delays were due to cold weather and not freight traffic. The cold weather caused mechanical issues and limited how long crews could work outside. BNSF spent money on repairs and maintenance along the corridor over 2014, which included replacing ties, switches, and adding switch covers which would protect switches from ice and snow. While January through October 2014 saw trains arriving on-time just 65.7 percent of the time, during the month of December trains were back to 95 percent on-time performance. Metro Transit offered refunds to customers whose trains were more than 10 minutes late in January and February 2015 in an effort to draw back ridership. During January 2015 trips were on time 98% of the time.

== Ridership ==
Ridership in the first 15 days averaged 2,207 per day (33,112 total), short of a goal of 2,460. By the end of January 2010, goals were exceeded by 3%. Ridership for 2010 was originally projected to be 897,000 though ultimately ended up at 715,000. Because ridership varies significantly through the course of a year, Metro Transit&#x27;s month-to-month goals are different from the yearly average goal. Daily ridership was 2,814 in 2019, the same level it was in 2017. It was projected to be 5,590 in 2025 and 6,200 in 2030, according to a 2009 study by Kimley-Horn and Associates Inc.

== Route ==

At Target Field Station, the parallel rail lines of the old Great Northern Railway (north side track now BNSF) and the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway (south side track now Union Pacific) travel eastbound past the Federal Reserve Bank, the site of the old Minneapolis Great Northern Depot, across the Mississippi River on the Minneapolis BNSF Rail Bridge and then across Nicollet Island. At a wye, the route turns northwest in the GN East side line, which then joins the parallel ex-Northern Pacific main line. The ex-Great Northern and ex-Northern Pacific lines are merged into BNSF and this is now the BNSF Northern Transcon (transcontinental) line.

The route travels north through the Northtown Classification Yards, over Interstate 694 and makes its first stop at 61st Avenue in Fridley at the yard limit of Northtown, where it enters BNSF&#x27;s Staples Subdivision. The double track line continues past the current Foley Boulevard park-and-ride bus station, which is planned to be a future Northstar station and turns northwest at Coon Creek Junction, where the old GN route to Duluth (now BNSF&#x27;s Hinckley Subdivision) splits off and heads straight north. The current Coon Rapids station is behind the Riverdale shopping center by Round Lake Boulevard and new stations were also built in Anoka, Elk River, and Big Lake.

The Great Northern Railway and Northern Pacific Railway had local services from Minneapolis to all of the cities currently served by Northstar up through the early 20th century. One Fridley station was about a mile north of the current stop, at Mississippi Boulevard. There possibly was a stop shared by GN and NP at Coon Creek Junction. There were at least three stations built in Anoka over the years, and two stations in Elk River and Big Lake, with both cities having one stop for each railroad.

== Upgrades and potential extension to St. Cloud ==
The double-track main line between Northtown Yard in Minneapolis and Coon Creek Junction in Coon Rapids is the busiest rail corridor in the Twin Cities metropolitan area. In July 2009, before the Northstar Commuter Rail commuter line began operation, this segment had hosted 63 trains per day. The Minnesota Department of Transportation would like to run more passenger trains through the corridor, including Northstar and other proposed passenger rail routes like the proposed &quot;Northern Lights Express&quot; to Duluth. A $113.4 million project to add a third main line and a new station at Foley Boulevard in Coon Rapids is planned. A $99 million grant request was filed under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to cover most of the cost. TIGER grants are expected to be awarded on February 17, 2010.

Foley station was among cuts to the Northstar plan in 2003 while federal funding was being sought prior to construction. Despite the fact the 3,200-stall parking facility already existed (sans boarding platforms), riders would not save enough time by switching from existing bus service to rail to make the stop fit within the guidelines enforced by Federal Transit Administration&#x27;s cost-effectiveness index. A station in Ramsey at Ramsey Town Center was also cut prior to construction. Ramsey station construction has since been fully funded, and construction began on March 27, 2012; it was completed on November 8 and opened on November 14, 2012.

A major obstacle to extending Northstar to St. Cloud had been the lack of double-tracked rail for nine miles (14 km) from Big Lake to Becker. However, due to increased freight traffic on the line, BNSF double-tracked the corridor in 2015. The Minnesota Department of Transportation says that extending Northstar would result in 1 to 1.5 million annual trips on the line. In its 2010 State Rail Plan, the agency stated an expectation of farebox recovery ratios between 70% and 111% on the full line. However, the same plan estimated farebox recovery ratios of just 21% to 34% on the proposed &quot;Northern Lights Express&quot;, which in a 2007 business plan had calculated ratios of over 100%. On November 8, 2010, it was announced that the planned extension of the line to St. Cloud had been indefinitely delayed. Projected ridership is not sufficient to qualify for federal funding.

Proposals to extend the line have continued to surface in the years following opening of the line. In 2016 and 2018, Minnesota state legislators proposed extending the line to St. Cloud using existing equipment by running two daily round-trips to St. Cloud and reducing other trips to Minneapolis from five to four. Governor Mark Dayton proposed a six month demonstration service to St. Cloud in 2017 but the demonstration would have only included 1 round trip a day and not have trains stopping at stations between Minneapolis and St. Cloud. Extending the line to Camp Ripley was proposed in 2019 by House of Representative legislators. Another extension feasibility study sponsored by MnDOT was released in July 2020.

Possible extension of the line has been revived in the 2022 Transportation Omnibus bill passed by the MN legislature. The bill includes funding for a study that would consider different possible rail service to the St Cloud and Fargo-Moorhead regions. This could include recommendations to extend Northstar.

== Pandemic and future ==
After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Metro Transit eliminated weekend service and special event service. Weekly trips dropped from 72 to 20. Ridership on the line was down 95% in August 2020 compared to before the pandemic.
 Lakeville&#x27;s state representative, Jon Koznick, proposed shuttering Northstar operations in 2021 but that would require the repayment of $85 million in federal funds used to construct the project. The Republican-controlled Minnesota Senate proposed closing Northstar in the 2022 legislative session and included asking the federal government to not require the repayment of federal funds.

Metro Transit and MnDOT in combination with three counties that Northstar operates in, Anoka County, Hennepin County, and Sherburne County, agreed to a master funding agreement in 2018 that covered operating expenses through 2022. Anoka County ceased paying their financial contribution by the second half of 2020. The county requested a reduced payment due to reduced ridership. By 2022, the county owed Metro Transit $7.9 million for operating expenses stretching from 2020 to 2022. Special event service to Minnesota Twins games was not offered in 2022 due to the funding issue. Northstar served 81,561 rides to 64 Minnesota Twins games in 2019. 

Anoka County ended up paying Metro Transit for 2020 and 2021 operating expenses after the 2021 bill was reduced from nearly $6 million to $1.95 million due to funds from BNSF and federal COVID relief bills. For the 2022 operating budget, Anoka County considered a $1.95 million payment to be their &quot;full and final payment for 2022&quot; despite Metro Transit requesting $4.6 million. Anoka County argued that they are paying the same amount from their 2021 bill for 2022 because the same amount of service is being offered while Metro Transit states it cannot increase service without covering the full operating costs of the line.

The Metropolitan Council is conducting a study on the future of Northstar post pandemic but the study will not produce any decisions or recommendations. The study is tentatively expected to be completed the winter of 2022–2023.

Construction of the Northern Lights Express Intercity passenger train from Downtown Minneapolis to Duluth may add a transfer station at Coon-Rapids Foley Boulevard to allow for transfers between Northstar and NLX trains to other Amtrak intercity routes.

On October 2, 2023, service was increased to four round trips every weekday, including one reverse peak trip. Special event service returned, serving Twins and Vikings games. There is still no weekend service. An increase in the sales tax in the seven-county metropolitan area approved in the 2023 Minnesota legislative session would help cover the increased expenses.

On February 23, 2025, Minnesota State House Representative Jon Koznick, serving as the chair of the House Transportation Finance and Policy Committee and historical critic of Northstar, advanced a bill in the state house to terminate operations on the line. Shortly after Koznick&#x27;s bill was sent to the General Register, the Minnesota Department of Transportation and Metropolitan Council released a statement that the agencies had &quot;jointly started the process to explore transitioning to bus service.&quot;

== Rolling stock ==

The line opened in 2009 with five MPI MP36PH-3C locomotives and seventeen Bombardier BiLevel Coach cars. Each passenger car has about 140 seats and room for 355 when full with standees. The coaches have two doors on either side. Upon the opening, Metro Transit immediately announced that a sixth locomotive was being acquired from the Utah Transit Authority&#x27;s &quot;FrontRunner&quot; service in the Salt Lake City area and a lease agreement was soon signed. Typical weekday operation requires five trains, each consisting of one locomotive and three or four coaches. A single train is used for weekend service, making three round trips each day. The platforms are only designed for five-car trains, so longer trains would require additional construction.

Metro Transit did begin experimenting in April 2010 with six-car trains for taking riders to and from weekend Twins games at Target Field. These trains overhang the platform at either end and only open one door on each of the end cars. In May, trains serving Twins games grew to eight cars, with some completely overhanging the platforms so some riders would have to board and then walk from one car to another. By June, Metro Transit had decided to purchase the sixth locomotive it had leased from UTA (No. 512) due to high leasing costs and the need to have an extra locomotive for when others are being repaired or inspected. A $10.1 million contingency fund built into the original cost of the service provided $2.85 million for buying the locomotive and repainting it in Northstar livery.

<text>Klaus Kinkel (17 December 1936 – 4 March 2019) was a German statesman, civil servant, diplomat and lawyer who served as the minister of Foreign affairs (1992–1998) and the vice chancellor of Germany (1993–1998) in the government of Helmut Kohl.

Kinkel was a career civil servant and a longtime aide to Hans-Dietrich Genscher, and served as his personal secretary in the Federal Ministry of the Interior from 1970 and in senior roles in the Foreign Office from 1974. He was President of Federal Intelligence Service from 1979 to 1982 and a state secretary in the Federal Ministry of Justice from 1982 to 1991. In 1991 he was appointed as the Federal Minister of Justice and joined the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) shortly after. In 1992 he became Foreign Minister, and in 1993 he also became the Vice Chancellor of Germany and the leader of the Free Democratic Party. He left the government in 1998 following its electoral defeat. Kinkel was a member of the Bundestag from 1994 to 2002, and was later active as a lawyer and philanthropist.

During his brief tenure as Minister of Justice he pressed for the extradition and criminal prosecution of deposed East German dictator Erich Honecker and sought to end the left-wing terrorism of the Red Army Faction. As Foreign Minister he is regarded as one of the most influential European politicians of the 1990s. He personified an &quot;assertive foreign policy&quot;, increased Germany&#x27;s peacekeeping engagements overseas, was at the forefront among Western leaders of building a relationship with Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s newly democratic Russian Federation and pressed for Germany to be given a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. He also championed the Maastricht Treaty, the merging of the Western European Union with the EU to give the EU an independent military capability and the expansion of the EU. Kinkel played a central role in the efforts to resolve the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, and proposed the creation of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.

==Education==
Kinkel was born in Metzingen, Baden-Württemberg, into a Catholic family, and grew up mostly in Hechingen, where his father Ludwig Leonhard Kinkel practised as a medical doctor and internist. His father was President of the local tennis club, and Klaus Kinkel was an able tennis player in his youth. He took his Abitur at the Staatliches Gymnasium Hechingen in 1956 and first studied medicine, then law at the universities of Tübingen and Bonn. He joined A.V. Guestfalia Tübingen, a Catholic student fraternity that is a member of the Cartellverband. Kinkel took his first juristic state exam at Tübingen, the second in Stuttgart and earned a doctorate of law in 1964 in Cologne.

==Career as a civil servant==
In 1965, Kinkel began work at the Federal Ministry of the Interior, concentrating on the security of the civilian population (&quot;ziviler Bevölkerungsschutz&quot;). He was sent to the &quot;Landratsamt&quot; in Balingen, Baden-Württemberg until 1966. He returned to the national ministry in 1968. He was personal secretary and speechwriter for the Federal Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, from 1970 to 1974, and eventually the head of the minister&#x27;s office. After Genscher was appointed Foreign Minister in 1974, Kinkel held senior positions in the Federal Foreign Office, as head of the &quot;Leitungsstab&quot; and the policy planning staff (&quot;Planungsstab&quot;).

===President of the Federal Intelligence Service===
From 1979 to 1982 he was president of the Federal Intelligence Service (BND). He is credited with &quot;quietly and competently&quot; restoring confidence in the BND after a series of scandal in the preceding years. He also expanded the BND&#x27;s intelligence-gathering outside of Europe.

===State secretary===
From 1982 to 1991, Kinkel was a state secretary (&quot;Staatssekretär&quot;) in the Federal Ministry of Justice.

==Political career==

===Federal Minister of Justice===
Kinkel was Federal Minister of Justice from 18 January 1991 to 18 May 1992. Among other achievements, he took the lead in pressing for the return of Erich Honecker, the former East German leader, to face trial. He also engaged in public negotiations with the terrorist Red Army Faction, successfully urging them to renounce violence.

===Minister of Foreign Affairs and FDP chairman===
In a surprise decision on 29 April 1992, the members of the FDP parliamentary group rejected the nomination of Germany&#x27;s designated new Foreign Minister, Irmgard Schwaetzer, and voted instead to name Kinkel to head the Federal Foreign Office.

Kinkel played a key role in the creation of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and helped to draft its statutes. He also unsuccessfully introduced a resolution at a meeting of European Community foreign ministers that would have committed each of the member countries to accept more refugees from the Balkans. Later that year, he announced Germany&#x27;s wish for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, arguing that Britain and France would never agree to an alternative plan under which they would merge their national seats into a single permanent seat representing the European Union. Kinkel was a signatory of the Dayton Agreement that ended the Bosnian War in 1995.
Under the leadership of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Kinkel, the German Bundestag in 1993 agreed on a three-point amendment to the 1949 Constitution that for the first time let German troops take part in international peacekeeping operations sanctioned by the United Nations and other bodies, subject to advance approval by parliament. Shortly after, the German Parliament approved a controversial troop deployment under the umbrella of the United Nations Operation in Somalia II, clearing the final hurdle for what was then Germany&#x27;s biggest deployment of ground forces abroad since World War II. Also under Kinkel’s leadership, Germany began destroying stockpiles of tanks and other heavy weapons in the early 1990s, becoming the first country to implement the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe.

In 1995, China dismissed a personal appeal from Kinkel to release Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng and expelled journalist Henrik Bork, a reporter for the newspaper &quot;Frankfurter Rundschau&quot;. One year later, China abruptly canceled a planned visit to Beijing by Kinkel, citing a German parliamentary resolution that condemned China&#x27;s human rights record in Tibet.

A strong supporter of European integration, Kinkel successfully advocated for Germany to ratify the Maastricht Treaty on European political and economic union in December 1992, making it the 10th of the 12 European Community nations to sign on. In 1994, he had to abandon his candidate for President of the European Commission, Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene of Belgium, following protest by British Prime Minister John Major. In 1997, he argued that Turkey did not qualify because of its record on &quot;human rights, the Kurdish question, relations with Greece and of course very clear economic questions.&quot; On Kinkel’s initiative, Germany became the first government to declare a suspension of contacts with Bosnia&#x27;s envoys abroad after a recommendation made by the High Representative of the International Community in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Carlos Westendorp.

From 21 January 1993, Kinkel was also Vice Chancellor of Germany. From 1993 to 1995 he also served as chairman of the FDP. After the Free Democrats won barely enough votes to get into the Bundestag in 1994 and later lost badly in 12 out of 14 state and European Parliament elections, Kinkel announced that he would not seek re-election as party chairman. He resigned as Foreign Minister and Vice Chancellor after the government&#x27;s defeat in the 1998 federal election.

===Member of Parliament===
Kinkel was a member of the Bundestag, the Parliament of Germany, from 1994 to 2002.

==Life after politics==

After leaving government in 1998, Kinkel worked as a lawyer and was engaged in a number of philanthropic and business activities, including the following: 
* Bundesliga Foundation, Member of the Board of Trustees
* Sepp Herberger Foundation, Member of the Board of Trustees
* International Club La Redoute Bonn, Member of the Advisory Board
* United Nations Association of Germany (DGVN), Member of the Presidium
* Deutsche Initiative für den Nahen Osten (DINO), Member of the Board of Trustees
* Lehman Brothers, Member of European Advisory Council (since 2002) 
* Deutsche Telekom Foundation, Founding Chairman of the Executive Board (2003–2014)
* EnBW, Member of the Advisory Board (2004–09)

At the request of Chancellor Angela Merkel, Kinkel represented the German government at the 2011 funeral of Sultan bin Abdulaziz, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.

In November 2016, Kinkel was elected as president of a newly created ethics commission of the German Football Association (DFB); the commission is part of the DFB&#x27;s declared drive for more transparency and integrity following revelations of a financial scandal around the 2006 FIFA World Cup it hosted.

<doc id="666491" wikidata="Q7770788" url="?curid=666491" title="The Twelfth Man">
<text>The Twelfth Man (also known as The 12th Man) is the name for a series of comedy productions by Australian satirist Billy Birmingham. Birmingham, a skilled impersonator, is generally known for parodying Australian sports commentators&#x27; voices. As befits the name (a reference to the non-playing reserve in an eleven-player cricket side), Birmingham focused in particular on cricket commentators such as Richie Benaud, Bill Lawry, Ian Chappell and Tony Greig. This is also because many of Australia&#x27;s cricket commentators have distinctive and easily identifiable voices and accents.

The album parodies are designed as a comical look &quot;behind the scenes&quot; of the Nine Network&#x27;s cricket commentary. Birmingham traditionally plays all the roles (with the exception of Ken Sutcliffe, who played himself; and some minor female characters, such as Richie Benaud&#x27;s secretary). Benaud himself sent a critique of each CD to Birmingham and was known to have a mixed opinion of the recordings, due predominantly to Birmingham&#x27;s use of profanity. All albums were produced and engineered by David Frogatt.

The Twelfth Man is the only Australian recording artist in history to have seven consecutive number one albums. In an article in the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; on 22 November 2009, Birmingham announced that &quot;Boned!&quot; would be his last studio album as The Twelfth Man.

==Personalities parodied==
In addition to Richie Benaud himself, Bill Lawry, Ian Chappell and Tony Greig, the 12th Man features various other Australian commentators from throughout Channel Nine&#x27;s line-up. They include Max Walker, Mark &quot;Tubby&quot; Taylor, Ian&#x27;s brother Greg Chappell, Michael &quot;Slats&quot; Slater, Englishman Mark Nicholas and West Indian Michael Holding.

Several non-cricket commentators are also parodied by Birmingham. They include rugby league commentators Ray &quot;Rabbits&quot; Warren and Paul &quot;Fatty&quot; Vautin, Peter &quot;Sterlo&quot; Sterling, Steve Roach, Darrell Eastlake, Lou Richards, Jack &quot;Supercoach&quot; Gibson, Ian &quot;Bear&quot; Maurice, Mike &quot;Gibbo&quot; Gibson and horse racing commentator Ken Callander. 

Other figures from Australian culture are also parodied. They include media magnate and Channel Nine owner Kerry Packer, former prime minister John Howard, journalist Mike Munro, Nine Network continuity announcer Steve Britten, and talkback radio personalities John Laws and Alan Jones.

==Comic themes==
Productions tend to focus on two themes: the voices and personalities of the commentators themselves, and parodies of athletes&#x27; names. This includes both humorous modifications of real-life players, as well as purely fictional names. Virtually all sports and teams are subject to this, except for the Australian cricket team.

Names of Indian cricket team and Pakistani cricket team are the most commonly parodied. For example, Sunil Gavaskar is referred to as Sunil Haveascar, a humorous reference to his fictional teammate &quot;Cuthis Arminhalf&quot; (a reference to Mohinder Amarnath). New Zealand cricket team players&#x27; names are sometimes parodied, as are those of the England cricket team. The Australian cricket team is never parodied on the basis of their names, but humorous references still extend to other aspects of the team, in particular Bruce Reid who is called &quot;Breece Rude&quot; by Bill Lawry and who, at one stage, slips over and snaps in half before taping himself back together to resume playing (Reid was known throughout his career for being tall and thin and susceptible to injury).

Humor even extends to the names of umpires and team coaches.

===Voices and personalities===
The Twelfth Man is most well known for Birmingham&#x27;s impression of the main characters voices, as well as their unique personalities and styles on air. These parodies include:
* Richie Benaud is the leader of the Central Commentary Team, and often remarks that &quot;We work as a team, and we do it my way&quot;. There is focus on his famous pronunciation of the number two to sound like &quot;chew&quot;, with the number two being a very popular term in the series. His fashion sense is also a point of humor, as Benaud&#x27;s jackets of choice are either cream, white, off-white, ivory, bone or beige. Benaud also has a vineyard in France, &quot;Chateau Verda Flore&quot; managed by a Frenchman named Henri Porte. A very proud man, Benaud is often mistaken for Darrell Eastlake, much to Benaud&#x27;s chagrin.
* Bill Lawry is another main character, usually presenting with his colleague Tony Greig. Lawry has a relatively high-pitched and nasally voice, with many jokes coming at the expense of his large nose. Lawry is from Victoria and is extremely biased towards Victorian players, venues and crowds. He has a particular affection for fellow Victorians Merv Hughes, Dean Jones and Shane Warne, as well as his collection of racing pigeons. His common expressions include &quot;Got him, yes! Piss off! You&#x27;re out!&quot; and &quot;The tension, the drama, the buzz, the crowd, the atmosphere!&quot; Lawry is also frequently late for team meetings, much to Benaud&#x27;s chagrin.
* Tony Greig is Lawry&#x27;s sparring partner, and often are the first two commentators of the game. A native of South Africa, Greig has a thick South African accent and is ridiculed for his heavily accented pronunciation of words like &quot;off&quot;, &quot;half&quot;, &quot;broadcast&quot;. Greig carries out the pitch reports before each game, and is famous for sticking foreign objects into the pitch—usually his car keys but occasionally his Italian loafers and even a fountain pen belonging to Richie. These items often get stuck in the pitch, leading to much aggravation with the rest of the team. Greig is a relatively neutral commentator but does display a certain allegiance to South African teams.
* The Chappell brothers of Ian and Greg typically work as a pair. They are known for their calm, non-controversial demeanors.
* Max Walker is portrayed as a maniacal and unhinged personality. With his own distinct tones, Max is often caught not paying attention to the goings-on on the field. Having been sacked early in the series, many of Walker&#x27;s hijinx involve his attempts to re-join the commentary team. These include the changing of his name by deed poll to Mike Walker, his kidnapping of fellow commentator Ken Sutcliffe to guarantee his own success, and his takeover of the commentary box (by force) with Benaud held hostage.
* Darrell Eastlake is shown as an over-the-top and exuberant personality, which does not always sit well with Richie. Eastlake finds it hard to contain his own excitement, as his voice will rise to a fever pitch during the announcement of a simple play or event. Despite having virtually no similarities in voice or appearance with Benaud, they are often mistaken for each other.
* Ken Sutcliffe, known as the Male Model from Mudgee, is actually voiced by Sutcliffe himself. Considerable humor is dedicated to Sutcliffe&#x27;s handsome features, and is seen as being a hit with the ladies—including the wives of both Benaud and Walker. When it is announced he is a possible addition to the commentary team, Sutcliffe is kidnapped by Max Walker in order to guarantee Walker&#x27;s own successes.

== Other appearances ==
During the 2005–06 Australian cricket season, the free online cricket game &quot;Stick Cricket&quot; featured commentary from The 12th Man. This was returned for the 2006–07 series and included an interview with The 12th Man by &quot;Stick Cricket&quot; fans. It features some new lines such as &quot;And welcome back to the SCG or the MCG or the Gabba or the WACA or wherever the hell we are&quot; and classic lines like &quot;Got him, yes! Piss off, you&#x27;re out!&quot;

On 8 December 2006, the Twelfth Man was a guest radio DJ on Triple M for several hours choosing the music, providing comments and playing clips from &quot;Boned!&quot;

==Following==
The 12th Man has a large following all around the world. Outside Australia, the UK probably has the most fans, with South Africa a very close second. Albums have been learned by heart by many, and Billy Birmingham is often greeted with impressions of his work. There are large groups petitioning for a new album, but Birmingham is reluctant, as his main star, Richie Benaud, had announced his retirement (eclipsed by Benaud&#x27;s death on 10 April 2015), with newer commentators taking the fore.

<doc id="666496" wikidata="Q1579138" url="?curid=666496" title="Unified Thread Standard">
<text>The Unified Thread Standard (UTS) defines a standard thread form and series—along with allowances, tolerances, and designations—for screw threads commonly used in the United States and Canada. It is the main standard for bolts, nuts, and a wide variety of other threaded fasteners used in these countries. It has the same 60° profile as the ISO metric screw thread, but the characteristic dimensions of each UTS thread (outer diameter and pitch) were chosen as an inch fraction rather than a millimeter value. The UTS is currently controlled by ASME/ANSI in the United States.

==Origins==

==Basic profile==
Each thread in the series is characterized by its major diameter and its pitch, . UTS threads consist of a symmetric V-shaped thread. In any plane containing the thread axis, the flanks of the V have an angle of 60° to each other. The outermost and the innermost of the height of the V-shape are cut off from the profile.

The major diameter is the diameter of the screw measured from the outer edge of the threads. The minor diameter (also known as the root diameter) is the diameter of the screw measured from the inner edge of the threads. The major diameter may be slightly different from the shank diameter, which is the diameter of the unthreaded part of the screw. The diameters are sometimes given approximately in fractions of an inch (e.g. the major diameter of a #6 screw is 0.1380 in, approximately 0.140625 in.

The pitch is the distance between thread peaks. For UTS threads, which are single-start threads, it is equal to the lead, the axial distance that the screw advances during a 360° rotation. UTS threads do not usually use the pitch parameter; instead a parameter known as threads per inch (TPI) is used, which is the reciprocal of the pitch.

The relationship between the height and the pitch is found using the following equation where is half the included angle of the thread, in this case 30°:

formula_1

In an external (male) thread (e.g., on a bolt), the major diameter and the minor diameter define dimensions of the thread. This means that the external thread must end flat at , but can be rounded out below the minor diameter . Conversely, in an internal (female) thread (e.g., in a nut), the major and minor diameters are dimensions, therefore the thread profile must end flat at but may be rounded out beyond . These provisions are to prevent any interferences.

The minor diameter and effective pitch diameter are derived from the major diameter and pitch as:

formula_2

==Designation==

The standard designation for a UTS thread is a number indicating the nominal (major) diameter of the thread, followed by the pitch measured in threads per inch. For diameters smaller than inch, the diameter is indicated by an integer number defined in the standard; for all other diameters, the inch figure is given.

This number pair is optionally followed by the letters UNC, UNF or UNEF (Unified) if the diameter-pitch combination is from the &quot;coarse&quot;, &quot;fine&quot;, or &quot;extra fine&quot; series, and may also be followed by a tolerance class.

Example: #6-32 UNC 2B (major diameter: 0.1380 inch, pitch: 32 tpi)


The following formula is used to calculate the major diameter of a numbered screw greater than or equal to 0: &quot;Major diameter&quot; = &quot;Screw #&quot; × 0.013 in + 0.060 in. For example, the major diameter of a #10 screw is 10 × 0.013 in + 0.060 in = 0.190 in. To calculate the major diameter of &quot;aught&quot; size screws count the number of extra zeroes and multiply this number by 0.013 in and subtract from 0.060 in. For example, the major diameter of a #0000 screw is 0.060 in − (3 × 0.013 in) = 0.060 in − 0.039 in = 0.021 in.

The number series of machine screws has been extended downward to include #00-90 (0.047 in = 0.060 in − 0.013 in) and #000-120 (0.034 in = 0.060 in − 2 × 0.013 in) screws; however, the main standard for screws smaller than #0 is ANSI/ASME standard B1.10 Unified Miniature Screw Threads. This defines a series of metric screws named after their major diameters in millimetres, from 0.30 UNM to 1.40 UNM. Preferred sizes are 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 and 1.2 mm, with additional defined sizes halfway between. The standard thread pitch is approximately of the major diameter. The thread form is slightly modified to increase the minor diameter, and thus the strength of screws and taps. The major diameter still extends to within &quot;H&quot; of the theoretical sharp &quot;V&quot;, but the total depth of the thread is reduced 4% from &quot;H&quot; =  cos(30°) &quot;P&quot; ≈ 0.541&quot;P&quot; to 0.52&quot;P&quot;. This increases the amount of the theoretical sharp &quot;V&quot; which is cut off at the minor diameter by 10% from 0.25&quot;H&quot; to − ≈ 0.27456&quot;H&quot;.

The number series of machine screws once included more odd numbers and went up to #16 or more. Standardization efforts in the late 19th and the early part of the 20th century reduced the range of sizes considerably. Now, it is less common to see machine screws larger than #14, or odd number sizes other than #1, #3 and #5. Even though #14 and #16 screws are still available, they are not as common as sizes #0 through #12.

Sometimes &quot;special&quot; diameter and pitch combinations (UNS) are used, for example a major diameter with 20 threads per inch. UNS threads are rarely used for bolts, but rather on nuts, tapped holes, and threaded ODs. Because of this UNS taps are readily available. Most UNS threads have more threads per inch than the correlating UNF or UNEF standard; therefore they are often the strongest thread available. Because of this they are often used in applications where high stresses are encountered, such as machine tool spindles or automotive spindles.

==Gauging==

A screw thread gauging system comprises a list of screw thread characteristics that must be inspected to establish the dimensional acceptability of the screw threads on a threaded product and the gauge(s) which shall be used when inspecting those characteristics.

Currently this gauging for UTS is controlled by:

; ASME/ANSI B1.2-1983 Gauges And Gauging For Unified Inch Screw Threads: This Standard provides essential specifications and dimensions for the gauges used on Unified inch screw threads UN [unified] and UNR [external threads only] thread form, and covers the specifications and dimensions for the thread gauges and measuring equipment listed in Tables 1 and 2. The basic purpose and use of each gauge are also described.
; ASME/ANSI B1.3-2007 Screw Thread Gauging Systems for Acceptability: Inch and Metric Screw Threads (UN, UNR, UNJ, M, and MJ): 

These standards provide essential specifications and dimensions for the gauges used on Unified inch screw threads (UN, UNR, UNJ thread form) on externally and internally threaded products. It also covers the specifications and dimensions for the thread gauges and measuring equipment. The basic purpose and use of each gauge are also described. It also establishes the criteria for screw thread acceptance when a gauging system is used.

==Tolerance classes==
A classification system exists for ease of manufacture and interchangeability of fabricated threaded items. Most (but certainly not all) threaded items are made to a classification standard called the Unified Screw Thread Standard Series. This system is analogous to the fits used with assembled parts.

*Class 1 threads are loose fit, intended for ease of assembly or use in a dirty environment.
*Class 2 threads are free fit, and the most common. They are designed to maximize strength considering typical machine shop capability and machine practice.
*Class 3 threads are medium fit, still quite common and used for closer tolerances on high quality work.
*Class 4 threads previously designated a close fit for even tighter tolerances, but this classification is now obsolete.
*Class 5 fit is an interference thread, requiring the use of a wrench for turning. These can be seen in applications like spring shackles on an automobile.

The letter suffix &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; denotes whether the threads are external or internal, respectively. Classes 1A, 2A, 3A apply to external threads; Classes 1B, 2B, 3B apply to internal threads.

Thread class refers to the acceptable range of pitch diameter for any given thread. The pitch diameter is indicated as Dp in the figure shown above. There are several methods that are used to measure the pitch diameter. The most common method used in production is by way of a go/no-go gauge.

<text>The Digital Divide Network (DDN) is an online community of activists, policymakers, researchers and concerned citizens interested in sharing knowledge to help bridge the digital divide. It is a spinoff of Helping.org (Helping.org later changed its name to Network for Good). TakingITGlobal in Toronto, Ontario, Canada produces and coordinates DDN.

== History ==
DDN was originally launched as the Digital Divide Clearinghouse in October 1999. The Clearinghouse was a section of a larger web portal called Helping.org. Launched by the America Online Foundation, the Benton Foundation, the National Urban League and other institutions, Helping.org was dedicated to volunteerism, technology capacity building for nonprofits and charitable giving. Two months after the website was launched, Bill Clinton hosted a national Digital Divide Summit in Washington D.C. During the meeting, representatives from civil society and the private sector met with Clinton; soon, the idea was hatched to create a new national Web portal dedicated to bridging the digital divide. This decision led to the Digital Divide Clearinghouse spinning off from Helping.org to become a new website, The Digital Divide Network, which was launching in December 1999 by the Benton Foundation.

DDN has become a leading website for organizations interested in sharing news, research and other resources to help bridge the digital divide. The site has become more international as well, with users from more than 75 countries. In February 2004, the site and its senior staff relocated to Massachusetts to move their operation to the Education Development Center (EDC), as part of the creation of a new institute called the EDC Center for Media &amp; Community. DDN was then managed by director Andy Carvin. Cedar Pruitt served as website editor from April 2004 until September 2005. DDN is managed by TakingITGlobal.org, the Toronto-based NGO that redesigned the website in 2004. Andy Carvin is no longer directly involved in the website, though he continues to moderate the group&#x27;s email discussion list.

<text>Henry IV, Part 2 is a history play by William Shakespeare believed to have been written between 1596 and 1599. It is the third part of a tetralogy, preceded by &quot;Richard II&quot; and &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; and succeeded by &quot;Henry V&quot;.

The play is often seen as an extension of aspects of &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, rather than a straightforward continuation of the historical narrative, placing more emphasis on the highly popular character of Falstaff and introducing other comic figures as part of his entourage, including Ancient Pistol, Doll Tearsheet, and Justice Robert Shallow.

==Synopsis==

The play picks up where &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; left off. Its focus is on Prince Hal&#x27;s journey toward kingship, and his ultimate rejection of Falstaff. However, unlike &quot;Part One&quot;, Hal&#x27;s and Falstaff&#x27;s stories are almost entirely separate, as the two characters meet only twice and very briefly. The tone of much of the play is elegiac, focusing on Falstaff&#x27;s age and his closeness to death, which parallels that of the increasingly sick king.

Falstaff is still drinking and engaging in petty criminality in the London underworld. He first appears followed by a new character, a young page whom Prince Hal has assigned him as a joke. Falstaff enquires what the doctor has said about the analysis of his urine, and the page cryptically informs him that the urine is healthier than the patient. Falstaff delivers one of his most characteristic lines: &quot;I am not only witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other men.&quot; Falstaff promises to outfit the page in &quot;vile apparel&quot; (ragged clothing). He then complains of his insolvency, blaming it on &quot;consumption of the purse.&quot; They go off, Falstaff vowing to find a wife &quot;in the stews&quot; (i.e., the local brothels).

The Lord Chief Justice enters, looking for Falstaff. Falstaff at first feigns deafness in order to avoid conversing with him, and when this tactic fails pretends to mistake him for someone else. As the Chief Justice attempts to question Falstaff about a recent robbery, Falstaff insists on turning the subject of the conversation to the nature of the illness afflicting the King. He then adopts the pretense of being a much younger man than the Chief Justice: &quot;You that are old consider not the capacities of us that are young.&quot; Finally, he asks the Chief Justice for one thousand pounds to help outfit a military expedition, but is denied.

He has a relationship with Doll Tearsheet, a prostitute, who gets into a fight with Ancient Pistol, Falstaff&#x27;s ensign. After Falstaff ejects Pistol, Doll asks him about the Prince. Falstaff is embarrassed when his derogatory remarks are overheard by Hal, who is present disguised as a musician. Falstaff tries to talk his way out of it, but Hal is unconvinced. When news of a second rebellion arrives, Falstaff joins the army again, and goes to the country to raise forces. There he encounters an old school friend, Justice Shallow, and they reminisce about their youthful follies. Shallow brings forward potential recruits for the loyalist army: Mouldy, Bullcalf, Feeble, Shadow and Wart, a motley collection of rustic yokels. Falstaff and his cronies accept bribes from two of them, Mouldy and Bullcalf, not to be conscripted.

In the other storyline, Hal remains an acquaintance of London lowlife and seems unsuited to kingship. His father, King Henry IV is again disappointed in the young prince because of that, despite reassurances from the court. Another rebellion is launched against Henry IV, but this time it is defeated, not by a battle, but by the duplicitous political machinations of Hal&#x27;s brother, Prince John. King Henry then sickens and appears to die. Hal, seeing this, believes he is King and exits with the crown. King Henry, awakening, is devastated, thinking Hal cares only about becoming King. Hal convinces him otherwise and the old king subsequently dies contentedly.

The two story-lines meet in the final scene, in which Falstaff, having learned from Pistol that Hal is now King, travels to London in expectation of great rewards. But Hal rejects him, saying that he has now changed, and can no longer associate with such people. The London lowlifes, expecting a paradise of thieves under Hal&#x27;s governance, are instead purged and imprisoned by the authorities.

===Epilogue===

At the end of the play, an epilogue thanks the audience and promises that the story will continue in a forthcoming play &quot;with Sir John in it, and make you merry with fair Katharine of France; where, for all I know, Falstaff shall die of a sweat&quot;. Although Falstaff does &quot;die of a sweat&quot; in the subsequent play, &quot;Henry V&quot;, it is in London at the beginning of the play. His death is offstage, described by another character and he never appears on stage. &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; does have &quot;Sir John in it&quot;, but cannot be the play referred to, since the passage clearly describes the forthcoming story of Henry V and his wooing of Katherine of France in &quot;Henry V&quot;. Falstaff&#x27;s role as a cowardly soldier looking out for himself is taken by Ancient Pistol, his braggart sidekick in &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot; and &quot;Merry Wives&quot;.

The epilogue also assures the playgoer that Falstaff is not based on the anti-Catholic rebel Sir John Oldcastle, for &quot;Oldcastle died martyr, and this is not the man&quot;. Falstaff had originally been named Oldcastle, following Shakespeare&#x27;s main model, an earlier play &quot;The Famous Victories of Henry V&quot;. Shakespeare was forced to change the name after complaints from Oldcastle&#x27;s descendants. While it is accepted by modern critics that the name was originally Oldcastle in Part 1, it is disputed whether or not Part 2 initially retained the name, or whether it was always &quot;Falstaff&quot;. According to René Weis, metrical analyses of the verse passages containing Falstaff&#x27;s name have been inconclusive.

==Sources==
Shakespeare&#x27;s primary source for &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;, as for most of his chronicle histories, was Raphael Holinshed&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles&quot;; the publication of the second edition in 1587 provides a &quot;terminus a quo&quot; for the play. Edward Hall&#x27;s &quot;The Union of the Two Illustrious Families of Lancaster and York&quot; appears also to have been consulted, and scholars have also supposed Shakespeare to have been familiar with Samuel Daniel&#x27;s poem on the civil wars.

==Date and text==

&quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot; is believed to have been written sometime between 1596 and 1599. It is possible that Shakespeare interrupted his composition of &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot; somewhere around Act 3–4, so as to concentrate on writing &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;, which may have been commissioned for an annual meeting of the Order of the Garter, possibly the one held on 23 April 1597.

The play was entered into the Register of the Stationers&#x27; Company on 23 August 1600 by the booksellers Andrew Wise and William Aspley. The play was published in quarto the same year (printing by Valentine Simmes). Less popular than &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, this was the only quarto edition. The play next saw print in the First Folio in 1623.

The quarto&#x27;s title page states that the play had been &quot;sundry times publicly acted&quot; before publication. Extant records suggest that both parts of &quot;Henry IV&quot; were acted at Court in 1612—the records rather cryptically refer to the plays as &quot;Sir John Falstaff&quot; and &quot;Hotspur&quot;. A defective record, apparently to the &quot;Second part of Falstaff&quot;, may indicate a Court performance in 1619.

The earliest extant manuscript text of scenes from &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot; can be found in the Dering Manuscript (Folger MS V.b.34), a theatrical abridgment of both parts of &quot;Henry IV&quot; prepared around 1623.

==Criticism and analysis==

&quot;Part 2&quot; is generally seen as a less successful play than &quot;Part 1&quot;. Its structure, in which Falstaff and Hal barely meet, can be criticised as undramatic. Some critics believe that Shakespeare never intended to write a sequel, and that he was hampered by a lack of remaining historical material with the result that the comic scenes come across as mere &quot;filler&quot;. However, the scenes involving Falstaff and Justice Shallow are admired for their touching elegiac comedy, and the scene of Falstaff&#x27;s rejection can be extremely powerful onstage.

The critic Harold Bloom has suggested the two parts of &quot;Henry IV&quot; along with the Hostess&#x27; elegy for Sir John in &quot;Henry V&quot; may be Shakespeare&#x27;s greatest achievement.

== Adaptations ==
There have been three BBC television films of &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;. In the 1960 mini-series &quot;An Age of Kings&quot;, Tom Fleming starred as Henry IV, with Robert Hardy as Prince Hal and Frank Pettingell as Falstaff. The 1979 BBC Television Shakespeare version starred Jon Finch as Henry IV, David Gwillim as Prince Hal and Anthony Quayle as Falstaff. In the 2012 series &quot;The Hollow Crown&quot;, &quot;Henry IV, Part I and Part II&quot; were directed by Richard Eyre and starred Jeremy Irons as Henry IV, Tom Hiddleston as Prince Hal and Simon Russell Beale as Falstaff.

Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;Chimes at Midnight&quot; (1965) compiles the two &quot;Henry IV&quot; plays into a single, condensed storyline, while adding a handful of scenes from &quot;Henry V&quot; and dialogue from &quot;Richard II&quot; and &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;. The film stars Welles himself as Falstaff, John Gielgud as King Henry, Keith Baxter as Hal, Margaret Rutherford as Mistress Quickly and Norman Rodway as Hotspur.

BBC Television&#x27;s 1995 &quot;Henry IV&quot; also combines the two Parts into one adaptation. Ronald Pickup played the King, David Calder Falstaff, and Jonathan Firth Hal.

Gus Van Sant&#x27;s 1991 film &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot; is loosely based on both parts of &quot;Henry IV&quot;.

The one-man hip-hop musical &quot;Clay&quot; is loosely based on &quot;Henry IV&quot;.

In 2015, the Michigan Shakespeare Festival produced an award-winning combined production, directed and adapted by Janice L. Blixt of the two plays, focusing on the relationship between Henry IV and Prince Hal.

== Pop culture ==

The Ultimate Edition of &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; features subtitles correlating scenes in the film to lines from the play.

The king&#x27;s opening soliloquy of Act III, scene 1 concludes with the line, &quot;Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown&quot;, which is frequently quoted (and misquoted, as &quot;Heavy is the head that wears the crown&quot;). It appears in the opening frame of the movie &quot;The Queen&quot;.

<text>In combinatorics, a greedoid is a type of set system. It arises from the notion of the matroid, which was originally introduced by Whitney in 1935 to study planar graphs and was later used by Edmonds to characterize a class of optimization problems that can be solved by greedy algorithms. Around 1980, Korte and Lovász introduced the greedoid to further generalize this characterization of greedy algorithms; hence the name greedoid. Besides mathematical optimization, greedoids have also been connected to graph theory, language theory, order theory, and other areas of mathematics.

==Definitions==
A set system is a collection of subsets of a ground set (i.e. is a subset of the power set of ). When considering a greedoid, a member of is called a feasible set. When considering a matroid, a feasible set is also known as an &quot;independent set&quot;.

An accessible set system is a set system in which every nonempty feasible set contains an element such that formula_1 is feasible. This implies that any nonempty, finite, accessible set system necessarily contains the empty set ∅.

A greedoid is a finite accessible set system that satisfies the &quot;exchange property&quot;:

* for all formula_2 with formula_3 there is some formula_4 such that formula_5

(Note: Some people reserve the term &quot;exchange property&quot; for a condition on the bases of a greedoid, and prefer to call the above condition the “augmentation property”.)

A basis of a greedoid is a maximal feasible set, meaning it is a feasible set but not contained in any other one. A basis of a subset of is a maximal feasible set contained in .

The rank of a greedoid is the size of a basis. 
By the exchange property, all bases have the same size.
Thus, the rank function is well defined. The rank of a subset of is the size of a basis of . Just as with matroids, greedoids have a cryptomorphism in terms of rank functions.
A function formula_6 is the rank function of a greedoid on the ground set if and only if is subcardinal, monotonic, and locally semimodular, that is, for any formula_7 and any formula_8 we have:
* subcardinality: formula_9
* monotonicity: formula_10 whenever formula_11
*local semimodularity: formula_12 whenever formula_13

==Classes==
Most classes of greedoids have many equivalent definitions in terms of set system, language, poset, simplicial complex, and so on. The following description takes the traditional route of listing only a couple of the more well-known characterizations.

An interval greedoid is a greedoid that satisfies the &quot;Interval Property&quot;:

* if formula_14 with formula_15 then, for all formula_16 
formula_17

Equivalently, an interval greedoid is a greedoid such that the union of any two feasible sets is feasible if it is contained in another feasible set.

An antimatroid is a greedoid that satisfies the &quot;Interval Property without Upper Bounds&quot;:

* if with then, for all implies 

Equivalently, an antimatroid is (i) a greedoid with a unique basis; or (ii) an accessible set system closed under union. It is easy to see that an antimatroid is also an interval greedoid.

A matroid is a non-empty greedoid that satisfies the &quot;Interval Property without Lower Bounds&quot;:

* if with then, for all implies 

It is easy to see that a matroid is also an interval greedoid.

==Examples==

*Consider an undirected graph . Let the ground set be the edges of and the feasible sets be the edge set of each &quot;forest&quot; (i.e. subgraph containing no cycle) of . This set system is called the cycle matroid. A set system is said to be a graphic matroid if it is the cycle matroid of some graph. (Originally cycle matroid was defined on circuits, or minimal &quot;dependent sets&quot;. Hence the name cycle.)
*Consider a finite, undirected graph rooted at the vertex . Let the ground set be the vertices of and the feasible sets be the vertex subsets containing that induce connected subgraphs of . This is called the vertex search greedoid and is a kind of antimatroid.
*Consider a finite, directed graph rooted at . Let the ground set be the (directed) edges of D and the feasible sets be the edge sets of each directed subtree rooted at with all edges pointing away from . This is called the line search greedoid, or directed branching greedoid. It is an interval greedoid, but neither an antimatroid nor a matroid.
*Consider an matrix . Let the ground set be the indices of the columns from 1 to and the feasible sets be formula_18 This is called the Gaussian elimination greedoid because this structure underlies the Gaussian elimination algorithm. It is a greedoid, but not an interval greedoid.

== Greedy algorithm ==

In general, a greedy algorithm is just an iterative process in which a &quot;locally best choice&quot;, usually an input of maximum weight, is chosen each round until all available choices have been exhausted.
In order to describe a greedoid-based condition in which a greedy algorithm is optimal (i.e., obtains a basis of maximum value), we need some more common terminologies in greedoid theory.
Without loss of generality, we consider a greedoid with finite.

A subset of is rank feasible if the largest intersection of with any feasible set has size equal to the rank of .
In a matroid, every subset of is rank feasible.
But the equality does not hold for greedoids in general.

A function formula_19 is &quot;R&quot;-compatible if formula_20 is rank feasible for all real numbers .

An objective function formula_21 is linear over a set formula_22 if, for all formula_23 we have formula_24 for some weight function formula_25

Proposition. A greedy algorithm is optimal for every R-compatible linear objective function over a greedoid.

The intuition behind this proposition is that, during the iterative process, each optimal exchange of minimum weight is made possible by the exchange property, and optimal results are obtainable from the feasible sets in the underlying greedoid. This result guarantees the optimality of many well-known algorithms. For example, a minimum spanning tree of a weighted graph may be obtained using Kruskal&#x27;s algorithm, which is a greedy algorithm for the cycle matroid. Prim&#x27;s algorithm can be explained by taking the line search greedoid instead.

<doc id="666528" wikidata="Q541590" url="?curid=666528" title="Leigh-on-Sea">
<text>Leigh-on-Sea (), commonly referred to simply as Leigh, is a town and civil parish within the city of Southend-on-Sea, located in the ceremonial county of Essex, England. In 2011 it had a population of 22,509.

==Geography==


Leigh-on-Sea is on the northern side of the Thames Estuary, a few miles from the open waters of the North Sea to the east, and a similar distance from the Kent coast to the south. The coastal environs of the town feature a nature reserve at Two Tree Island and a centrally located beach adjacent to Bell Wharf. At low tide Leigh&#x27;s foreshore has a wide expanse of mud flats and creeks, extending offshore towards the deep water channel of the Thames (Yantlet Channel). Leigh is from central London via road and rail networks and is part of the London commuter belt.

==History==
===Origins===
Archaeological finds of pottery and coins from Romano-British era in the locality suggest early settlement. From at least the Saxon period a hilltop clearing amidst the woodland that covered much of the surrounding area (the Rochford Hundred) of Essex came to be known as Leigh (Lee in Anglo-Saxon).

A place of minor economic importance at the time of the Norman Conquest, a reference to Leigh (Legra) appears in the Domesday Book survey of 1086 where it lists a population of 9, in the ownership of Ranulf Peverel in the Rochford Hundred.
St Clement&#x27;s Church was rebuilt in the late 15th century or early 16th century, although the list of rectors dates back 1248. The fabric of the church is of Kentish ragstone and flint rubble, with a Tudor porch constructed of red brick. The mediaeval structure of the church was added to and altered during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The chancel was extended at the east end in 1872 by C. F. Haywood; Ernest Geldart added the south aisle in 1897, and there were a number of alterations made by Sir Charles Nicholson in 1913 and 1919. The tower at the west end was a prominent landmark for shipping on the Thames Estuary, and the building contains a good selection of stained glass dating from between the 18th and 20th centuries. The building is Grade II* listed by Historic England, and a key factor for this rating was the sympathetic nature of the 19th and 20th century additions.

Leigh Hall, a medieval manor house for the parish that was demolished in 1907, was once situated near the ancient eastern manorial boundary of Leigh and Prittlewell.

Robert Eden, who became rector of Leigh in 1837, demolished the previous rectory and commissioned a large new one, which was completed in 1838. One quarter of the building remains today as Leigh Library, as the other wings of the building were demolished by Southend Corporation when they acquired the building and the surrounding land. The rectory and grounds occupied a site, and the work carried out by Eden included the construction of Rectory Grove as a public right of way, which replaced an existing cliff-top path called Chess Lane. Leigh Library was designated as a listed building at Grade II in 1974.

===&#x27;Old Leigh&#x27;===
In the 11th century Leigh was a marginal community of homesteads. The Domesday Book of 1086 records &#x27;five smallholders above the water who do not hold land&#x27;, who were probably engaged in fishing thus giving Leigh a claim to nearly a thousand years of activity in the fishing industry.

The main seafood catch from Leigh fishing boats has always been shellfish and whitebait. Many of the local trawlers were at one time bawleys, and two of Old Leigh&#x27;s pubs – the &quot;Peter Boat&quot; and &quot;Ye Olde Smack&quot; – owe their names to types of local fishing boat.

The riverside settlement of &#x27;Old Leigh&#x27;, or &#x27;The Old Town&#x27;, is historically significant; it was once on the primary shipping route to London. From the Middle Ages until the turn of the 20th century, Old Leigh hosted the settlement&#x27;s market square, and high street (known as Leigh Strand). Elizabethan historian William Camden (1551–1623) described Leigh as &quot;a proper fine little towne and verie full of stout and adventurous sailers&quot;. By the 1740s however, Leigh&#x27;s deep water access had become silted up (as attested to by John Wesley) and the village was in decline as an anchorage and port of call.

===Modern era===
Broadway developed between the 1870s and the 1920s from a residential street to a commercial parade of shopfronts, as the town began to expand. During the 1920s, Broadway was extended further west with the demolition of a large manor house, Black House/Leigh House (built 1620).

In 1983 Leigh gained its own paper, &quot;Leigh Times&quot;, and in 1996 gained its own Town Council.

During the 1990s and the early 21st century Leigh-on-Sea went through more change: the growing dominance of out-of-town, 24-hour supermarkets and retail parks, as well as the arrival and popularity of retail online shopping, meant that much local business had to reinvent itself, either as venues for socialising, or to offer niche services and products to cater for the town&#x27;s changing demographic.
Leigh-on-Sea has frequently been cited as one of the best places to live in the UK, owing to factors such as its proximity to London, nearby outstanding Westcliff and Southend grammar schools, good access to sports and arts activities, multiple opportunities to develop skills, and a strong sense of belonging and community spirit. A 2018 survey by Rightmove found that Leigh-on-Sea was the place in the UK where people were happiest living.

On 15 October 2021, Sir David Amess, the local Member of Parliament, was murdered at a constituency surgery being held in Belfairs Methodist Church in the town. Southend was granted city status as a memorial to Amess in 2022.

==Transport==
Leigh-on-Sea is served by Leigh-on-Sea railway station on the London, Tilbury and Southend line. The railway station is situated near the western end of Old Leigh marina. Built in 1934, it replaced the original 1855 station, which still exist and are currently used by Leigh Sailing Club. Regular, daily bus services run between Southend-on-Sea, Benfleet, Canvey Island, Basildon, Rayleigh and Chelmsford. Scheduled flights to national and European destinations operate out of nearby London Southend Airport.

==Governance==
Leigh-on-Sea is a district of Southend-on-Sea, and includes the electoral wards Belfairs, Blenheim Park, Eastwood Park, Leigh and West Leigh. The two latter Electoral Wards and one Poll District of Belfairs and Blenheim Park Wards are included in the Leigh-on-Sea Town Council area, which is a civil parish. It is represented in Parliament in the Southend West and Leigh constituency, by David Burton-Sampson. 

The population of the entire district taken at the 2011 Census was 38,931.

==Festivals and activities==
Several annual events have become well established, including Leigh Regatta, Leigh Folk Festival and The Leigh Art Trail. The regatta is held over one weekend in September.

== Museums and galleries ==
Leigh Heritage Centre is located in the Old Smithy and serves as a museum for Old Leigh. It is run by the Leigh Society, who have also opened the next-door Plumbs Cottage, a restored and substantially rebuilt 1850s fisherman&#x27;s cottage.

Old Leigh Art Studios is a commercial gallery with artists studios. It was established by the artist Sheila Appleton and potter Richard Baxter in 1991. They have since been joined by painter Ian Smith and ceramicist Julie O’Sullivan. The studios participate in the annual Leigh Art Trail.

<doc id="666534" wikidata="Q3962938" url="?curid=666534" title="Small Faces (1967 album)">
<text>Small Faces is the second studio album by Small Faces, released through Immediate Records on 23 June 1967. Although this was their first album for new manager Andrew Loog Oldham&#x27;s Immediate label, recording actually commenced during their tenure with Decca Records, whom they left in January 1967 after severing professional ties with original manager Don Arden. As a result of the switch of label and management, Decca and Arden released an outtakes compilation album, &quot;From the Beginning&quot; in early June 1967 in order to sabotage the chart success of the Immediate &quot;Small Faces&quot; release - something that it managed to do to some extent when &quot;From the Beginning&quot; reached number 17 in the UK charts. The Immediate album shares its name with their 1966 Decca debut album, which has led to some confusion regarding the titles. As a result of this, it has been unofficially dubbed The First Immediate Album by several fans.

The album is considered to be the artistic breakthrough for the group in terms of songwriting and composition, and marks their transition from a mod-influenced blue-eyed soul/R&amp;B band to a psychedelic studio group, which they were then seen as from this point until their breakup in early 1969. &#x27;Small Faces&#x27; was recorded over a lengthy (by the standard of the time) period of nine months, during the band&#x27;s tenure on both Decca and Immediate Records, at two separate studios. It is their first LP to contain solely original compositions. Thirteen of the album&#x27;s fourteen tracks were either written or co-written by Steve Marriott and Ronnie Lane, in contrast to the group&#x27;s 1966 debut, in which only seven of the twelve tracks are credited to the band, with the remaining tracks being written by artists such as Kenny Lynch and Ian Samwell, or being R&amp;B covers that were parts of the group&#x27;s early repertoire.

The album incorporates a blend of several different moods and genres of music, ranging from the relatively straight-up R&amp;B of &quot;Talk To You&quot;, the blue-eyed soul balladry of &quot;My Way of Giving&quot; and the brass-driven, bouncy soul-pop of &quot;All Our Yesterdays&quot;, to the more complex baroque pop of &quot;Show Me the Way&quot; and &quot;Feeling Lonely&quot;, and the power pop and psychedelia of tracks such as &quot;(Tell Me) Have You Ever Seen Me&quot; and &quot;Green Circles&quot;. The album also marks the debut of Ian McLagan as a solo composer, contributing his song &quot;Up the Wooden Hills to Bedfordshire&quot; which is the first of two compositions for the group credited to him alone (the second being &quot;Long Agos and Worlds Apart&quot; from &quot;Ogdens&#x27; Nut Gone Flake&quot;). It is also the first studio album by the group where McLagan plays on all tracks, whereas on their debut album both he and Jimmy Winston are jointly credited as keyboardist (about half of the debut album was recorded with Winston in June–September 1965, with the remaining tracks being recorded after McLagan joined the band in November 1965).

The album reached number 12 on the UK charts, becoming their only original studio album to chart outside the top-10 (both their debut album and &quot;Ogdens&#x27; Nut Gone Flake&quot; reached the top-5). Despite not containing a hit single, it was released in between their smash hits &quot;Here Come the Nice&quot; and &quot;Itchycoo Park&quot; and was highly regarded by other musicians, exerting a strong influence on a number of bands both at home and abroad. The album received mostly positive reviews from critics and fans alike, and has been featured on several best of lists, including &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&#x27;s&quot; list of Top 100 &#x27;60s Rock Albums, along with several lists by &quot;Mojo magazine&quot;. Many fans consider &quot;Small Faces&quot; to be the group&#x27;s best album.

== Background ==
=== Boundary Park incident (1966) ===
In 1966, the Small Faces managed to chart a top-5 album and four consecutive top-10 singles on the UK Singles Chart, including their number one hit &quot;All or Nothing&quot; which peaked in September 1966. The band had now developed a notable fanbase in the United Kingdom and mainland Europe. In a notable incident, fans of the band had, after a performance at the Boundary Park stadium, attempted breaking into the band&#x27;s vehicle, even climbing on top of it. Of the occurrence, Ian McLagan stated the following: 
=== Leaving Decca and signing to Immediate (1966–1967) ===
Demand for a new album had increased towards the end of the year, and by late 1966, Small Faces had slowly started to abandon their rhythm and blues roots, in favour of more psychedelic direction. The Beatles&#x27; manager Brian Epstein held a party at their residence on 22 Westmoreland Terrace in Pimlico, London, and introduced them to LSD for the first time after serving them spiked orange pieces served on the plate. Most tracks on the album were conceived and written by December 1966 and the earlier parts of 1967 by Steve Marriott and Ronnie Lane. Ian McLagan wrote his first solo-song for the band, titled &quot;Up the Wooden Hills to Bedfordshire&quot;; This is the sole composition on the album that was not written or co-written by the Marriott/Lane partnership.

During the later parts of 1966, their affiliation with Don Arden and Decca Records had strained, due to several aspects, including the fact that the band received barely any royalties from their records, and that &quot;My Mind&#x27;s Eye&quot; had been released without consent by the band. After a messy confrontation with Arden who tried to face down the boys&#x27; parents by claiming that the whole band were using drugs, they cut their ties with Arden and Decca. They were almost straight away offered a deal with the newly-established Immediate label, formed by ex-Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham, which they stayed on until their break-up in 1969.

== Recording ==

Tracks recorded specifically for a follow-up album to their debut commenced by August 1966 when tracks such as &quot;My Mind&#x27;s Eye&quot;, &quot;Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow, &quot;My Way of Giving&quot;, &quot;(Tell Me) Have You Ever Seen Me?&quot; and &quot;That Man&quot; were taped at IBC Studios, while the band were still signed to Decca Records. Between 5–7 December of that year, the group cut a song entitled &quot;Picaninny&quot;, a three-minute instrumental piece featuring Steve Marriott on harmonica. This track is thought to be a backing track, even though it had received mixes in both mono and stereo. Ultimately it was not included on the album, and got its official release on the compilation cassette &quot;Small Faces – Big Music: A Compleat Collection&quot; in 1984.

In early December, work on &quot;Get Yourself Together&quot; had started. By 13 December 1966 the group cut the backing track of the song &quot;Green Circles&quot; at IBC, further takes of the songs were recorded at Olympic Studios on 10 January 1967, with vocal takes attempted by both Steve Marriott and Ronnie Lane during that session. The following day, the group recorded &quot;All Our Yesterdays&quot;, &quot;Just Passing&quot; and 11 takes of a track dubbed &quot;Doolally&quot;, which was eventually renamed to &quot;Things Are Going to Get Better&quot; after recording take 14, which became the master track. At this point, the master take of &quot;Get Yourself Together&quot; had been completed. By 16 January, &quot;Talk to You&quot; had been recorded.

By February, the group recorded &quot;Become Like You&quot;, &quot;Something I Want to Tell You&quot; and &quot;Feeling Lonely&quot;. On 28 February, &quot;Eddie&#x27;s Dreaming&quot; had been recorded. The same day, &quot;Get Yourself Together&quot; and &quot;Green Circles&quot; had been mixed both in stereo and mono, with the definitive version featuring Ronnie Lane on lead vocals. In March, &quot;My Way of Giving&quot; had been rehauled, and &quot;Up The Wooden Hills To Bedfordshire&quot; had been recorded. The remaining tracks were recorded in April, and mixing had been finalized by May.

== Musical content ==
The album is a huge departure from the sound that made up their previous two albums, their eponymous debut and the compilation &quot;From the Beginning&quot;. Both albums featured many rhythm and blues covers, alongside originals in order to appeal to the mod audience the group amassed. For &quot;Small Faces,&quot; they wrote more material that could be classified as pop or psychedelia, which by 1967–1969 had reached its peak popularity. Both &quot;All Our Yesterdays&quot; and &quot;Eddie&#x27;s Dreaming&quot; incorporate brass instruments as focal points, while many other tracks feature the harpsichord played by Ian McLagan. The instrument is most prevalent on &quot;Feeling Lonely&quot; and &quot;Show Me the Way&quot;. The album also features influences from folk rock on &quot;Become Like You&quot; and &quot;Get Yourself Together&quot;, the latter of which features Marriott on twelve-string acoustic guitar.

It was by achieving this synthesis that Marriott and the band believed they had now met the criteria expected of them. Ronnie Lane&#x27;s predilection for a softer, pastoral and more psychedelic sound was heavily evident on songs such as &quot;Show Me The Way&quot; and &quot;All Our Yesterdays&quot;. It was the first release to feature Lane as a prevalent songwriter.

The vocal duty on the album is more varied than on their debut album, where Marriott sang ten of the twelve tracks. On the record, Lane assumes lead vocals on four songs, with Marriott singing lead on six. McLagan sings his sole composition &quot;Up the Wooden Hills to Bedfordshire&quot;. Marriott and Lane share lead vocals on &quot;Green Circles&quot; and &quot;Become Like You&quot; while the remaining track &quot;Happy Boys Happy&quot; is an instrumental.

==Release and reception==
=== Release ===
The album was released in both monaural and stereophonic versions on 23 June 1967 (IMLP 008 and IMSP 008, mono and stereo versions respectively) in the United Kingdom, and later, it was released in mainland Europe and Oceania. Even though it was a success, it failed to breach the top 10, peaking at number 12 on the UK Album Chart. This is most likely due to the lack of a hit single accompanying the album. Ultimately, it became the original lineup&#x27;s only studio effort to fail charting within the top 5 on the UK albums chart, as both their debut and &quot;Ogdens&#x27; Nut Gone Flake&quot; peaked at number 3 and 1 respectively.

The tracks recorded in the sessions from August 1966 ended up in assorted ways; &quot;My Mind&#x27;s Eye&quot; was issued as a single in November 1966, peaking at number 4. The remainder of the tracks ended up on &quot;From the Beginning&quot;, an album compiled of singles and unreleased material released by Decca on 2 June 1967. Of these tracks, only &quot;(Tell Me) Have You Ever Seen Me?&quot; and &quot;My Way of Giving&quot; were issued (in their re-recorded versions) on &quot;Small Faces.&quot; &quot;Talk to You&quot; was released as the B-Side of &quot;Here Come the Nice&quot; on 2 June, it managed to reach number 12 on UK Singles chart.

=== Reception ===
The album was well received and reviewed upon its release. In a retrospective review, AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave it 5 out 5 stars, praising the album for its sophisticated songs, and its pop melodies, stating: &quot;there may be some harpsichords but no outright psychedelia -- but it is bright, colorful, and concentrated, its very brevity playing like snappy pop art. No song runs over three minutes and many clock in under two, a direct contrast to the somewhat extended grooves of their 1966 LP, and an aesthetic that lends this an exceptionally modern feel: all the tunes are sharply cut and precisely tailored, with no wasted moments.&quot;

The Classic Rock magazine gave it 8/10 stars, while Mojo granted it 4 stars.

=== Reissues ===
LP reissues became the standard format for many years, until it finally became available on compact disc in Japan in 1989. Further CD remasters would reach mainland Europe, UK and the United States, where the album had been unavailable since 1967. Tracks from the album have since been included within compilations, most notably in &quot;The Darlings of Wapping Wharf Launderette,&quot; a 2-CD compilation of their work on Immediate Records, in which all tracks from it were included. Remasters of the album with a blue tint were sold exclusively at various Sainsbury&#x27;s locations during 2018.

However, the most prevalent and well-known of these reissues is the 2012 Deluxe Edition, which features several previously unreleased tracks, along with various A-sides and B-sides of the group&#x27;s 1967 singles. On this remaster is the track &quot;Don&#x27;t Burst My Bubble&quot;, recorded in February 1968. Paul Weller cited it as an inspiration for the title track of the Jam&#x27;s 1982 studio album &quot;The Gift&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
The album is a favourite of Paul Weller, who named the album in his &#x27;Top Ten of All-Time&#x27; in 1992. The Jam had covered &quot;Get Yourself Together&quot; between 1981–1982.

Donovan (a friend of the Small Faces) recorded &quot;Hurdy Gurdy Man&quot; in 1968, a song that both musically and thematically references &quot;Green Circles.&quot;

British singer Chris Farlowe released a cover of &quot;My Way of Giving&quot; as a single in early 1967. His version stayed on the UK Singles Chart for a single week, peaking at number 48.

&quot;My Way of Giving&quot; was also covered by Rod Stewart for his 1970 album &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot; backed by, as the personnel credits on the LP reveal, The Faces. The Faces featured former Small Faces Lane, Jones and McLagan, alongside Stewart and Ronnie Wood. Lane, Jones and McLagan are therefore effectively covering their own song, albeit it in a quite different, more uptempo &#x27;Motown&#x27; style arrangement.

==Track listing==
All tracks written by Steve Marriott and Ronnie Lane unless noted.

=== 2012 Deluxe edition ===
The album was completely remastered in 2012 and reissued as compact discs with previously unreleased material, along with various A-sides and B-sides from 1967.

<doc id="666542" wikidata="Q1647501" url="?curid=666542" title="Macross Zero">
<text>is an anime prequel OVA to &quot;The Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot; released for the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the &quot;Macross&quot; franchise during 2002 in Japan. It was created and directed by Shoji Kawamori and produced by Satelight.

==Premise==
&quot;Macross Zero&quot; is set in 2008 A.D., one year before the events of the original &quot;Macross&quot; series, depicting the final battles of the U.N. Wars between the U.N. Spacy and the Anti-UN forces, and is also set in the South Pacific, where a gigantic alien spaceship crash landed 9 years earlier. Amidst the violence, a U.N. Spacy F-14 &quot;KAI&quot; pilot named Shin Kudo is attacked by a strange enemy aircraft that can transform itself into a robot. Crash landing on Mayan Island he learns that this remote island and its peaceful native inhabitants hold a great secret linking them to the alien space ship and would become the focus of the war, whether they like it or not. Shin eventually returns to his carrier fleet and joins the Skull Squadron, who also operate brand new transforming fighters, the VF-0 Phoenix. He trains and engages Anti-UN forces operating from a converted ballistic missile submarine as both sides fight to locate and control alien artifacts, with the peaceful and agrarian Mayan caught in the middle of the war.

The mecha was created to check the evolution of humankind and was programmed to destroy it in case it became belligerent like the previous creation of the Protoculture, the Zentradi.

==Production==
The OVA was released in 2002 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the &quot;Macross&quot; franchise in Japan. New mechanical designs inspired by those of the first &quot;Macross&quot; series were developed by Shoji Kawamori and Junya Ishigaki, while mecha and sci-fi illustrator Hidetaka Tenjin worked as an animation artist for the CGI mecha action sequences. A Blu-ray box was released on August 22, 2008, which added Sheryl Nome&#x27;s earrings in a shot at the Nome beach house, to better connect the series with &quot;Macross Frontier&quot;.

==Episodes==
==Soundtrack==
Composed by Kuniaki Haishima, the OVA&#x27;s soundtrack is orchestral with some tribal influences. One track, titled &quot;VF-Zero&quot;, borrows a section of &quot;Klendathu Drop&quot; by Basil Poledouris, from the &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; soundtrack. The ending theme for episodes 1 and 5 is &quot;Arkan&quot; (which means &quot;star&quot; in the fictional Mayan language), performed by Holy Raz. &quot;Life Song&quot;, the ending theme for episode 2, is by Yen Chang and Holy Raz. Yuuka Nanri performs the episode 3 ending theme &quot;Yanyan&quot;.

Two volumes of the soundtrack were released in Japan by Victor Entertainment.

==International release==
Due to a legal dispute over the distribution rights of the &quot;Macross&quot; franchise, involving Studio Nue and Big West against Harmony Gold, much of the &quot;Macross&quot; merchandise post 1999, including &quot;Macross Zero&quot;, have not received an international release. In 2024, Crunchyroll announced &quot;Macross Zero&quot; will receive a limited Blu-ray release in 2025.

==OVA series notes==
Mao Nome&#x27;s reminiscences have become part of the pre-Space War legendarium of the expanding Human and Zentradi exploration of the Galaxy. The events of the movie paint the story in the style of Tales of the South Pacific, romantic and beautiful in the time before the Zentradi nearly annihilated all life on Earth during one of the most cataclysmic battles of the War. The people of the galaxy know this story as &#x27;Bird-Human&#x27;.

During the third &quot;Macross&quot; TV series, &quot;Macross Frontier&quot;, the 10th episode (&quot;Legend of Zero&quot;) retells the events of the OVA series as &quot;Bird Human&quot;, a movie made in on one of the colony&#x27;s city ships for the entertainment of the populace. The Four Romances: one completely doomed (Captain Nora and Captain Ivanov), one tragic (Dr. Aries Turner and Captain Roy Föcker - which led to his depression and incipient alcoholism only later broken by Claudia LaSalle), one impossible but real (Mao Nome&#x27;s love of Shin Kudo), and one transcendental (Sara Nome and Lt. Shin Kudo) make for a story of mysticism, love, music, and courage. The adaptation stars Miranda Merin (the reigning Miss Macross Frontier) as Sara Nome and Ranka Lee as Mao Nome (after the original actress is injured in a car accident on the way to the filming location). Alto Saotome, the main protagonist of &quot;Frontier&quot;, is the stunt double for the actor playing Shin Kudo (as the actor does not do underwater scenes, as stated in his contract). Incidentally, the film&#x27;s director bears a striking resemblance to series creator Shoji Kawamori.

Later episodes explicitly state that &quot;Macross Frontier&quot; singer Sheryl Nome is the granddaughter of Dr. Mao Nome, and showed a photograph of a much older but still recognizable Mao with glasses, clearly now a venerable survivor of Space War I.

==All That VF - Macross 25th Anniversary Air Show (Zero Edition)==
Coinciding with both the 25th anniversary of &quot;Macross&quot; and the Blu-ray releases of volume one of &quot;Macross Frontier&quot; and &quot;Macross Zero&quot; box set, the official website of &quot;Macross Frontier&quot; posted two newly animated short films featuring Air Show style demonstrations for both series. People who purchased the first pressings of either &quot;Macross Zero&quot; or &quot;Macross Frontier&quot; received a unique code to enter into the website and therefore able to watch the short film of the respective anime.

The music track for this clip was an excerpt from an orchestral track of &quot;Macross Frontier&quot; titled &quot;Vital Force&quot; composed by Yoko Kanno.

<doc id="666544" wikidata="Q876172" url="?curid=666544" title="Office of Special Investigations (United States Department of Justice)">
<text>The Office of Special Investigations (OSI) of the U.S Justice Department was created in 1979 to identify and expel, from the United States, those who assisted Nazis in persecuting &quot;any person because of race, religion, national origin, or political opinion.&quot; This involved gathering, verifying, and presenting in court eyewitness and documentary evidence of decades-old crimes. The evidence was incomplete and scattered around the world. Much of it was then in Eastern Europe, behind the Iron Curtain. Nonetheless, the OSI investigated 1,700 persons suspected of being involved in Nazi war crimes. Over 300 have been prosecuted with at least 100 stripped of their U.S. citizenship and 70 deported, the most recent in 2021. Others have left voluntarily, fled, or have been blocked from entering the United States. In the 1980s, at least seven men facing investigation or prosecution from the OSI committed suicide.

Immediately after World War II, Americans chose not to dwell upon the war&#x27;s atrocities, and Cold War threats caused governments to recruit former Nazis for intelligence work. Newly formulated U.S. immigration policies and prejudice created obstacles for entering the United States by people displaced by the war. As a result, it became easier for former Nazis and their collaborators to enter the U.S. than for Holocaust survivors. Sometimes protected by U.S. Intelligence officials, war criminals found a safe haven in America. OSI was founded to ferret them out. It operated as a separate unit until 2010 when it was merged with the Domestic Security Section of the Justice Department Criminal Division to form a new unit, the Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section (HRSP). According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the United States has successfully prosecuted more Nazis than all other countries combined and is &quot;widely deemed to have the world&#x27;s most aggressive and effective Nazi-hunting operation.&quot; While efforts continue to prosecute those involved in atrocities during World War II, the principal focus of HRSP&#x27;s human rights enforcement work is now on prosecuting war criminals from postwar conflicts including those in Bosnia, Serbia, Rwanda, and Guatemala.

A thorough history of OSI was produced by legal historian Judith Feigin of the Justice department in 2006. It concluded that, in addition to having obtained some measure of justice for wartime atrocities, OSI set international standards for prosecuting perpetrators of genocide and made substantial contributions to the historical record that &quot;stand as a permanent and irrefutable response to those who would deny the Holocaust and its horrors.&quot; Further, &quot;the message resonating from OSI&#x27;s cases is that the United States does not choose to add to its populace persons whose actions victimized innocent civilians.&quot;

==Founding of OSI==

===Braunsteiner-Ryan case===
In 1964, it was discovered that Hermine Braunsteiner, a former SS guard in the concentration camps Ravensbrück and Majdanek, was living in the United States. She had met Russel Ryan while he was on holiday in Austria, and she entered the United States in 1959 shortly after their marriage. The case caused an outcry and, as a result, the Special Litigation Unit was set up at the immigration authority. This group was to identify other war criminals from the Nazi-era who lived in the United States. The unit was transferred from INS to the Justice Department in September 1979.

===Initiative by Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman===
New York Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman called for and actively promoted strengthening the special unit to prosecute war criminals residing in the United States. The Office of Special Investigations (OSI) was established in 1979 within the US Department of Justice. Its task consisted of processing the accumulated cases and the resumption of the search for war criminals in the United States. The OSI was equipped with broad powers that enabled it to take all necessary steps to accomplish its mission including investigation, litigation, negotiating with foreign governments, and calling for support from other U.S. authorities.

==Early leadership==
As an assistant to the US solicitor general, Allan Ryan had been arguing cases before the Supreme Court on behalf of the government. By chance, he was assigned a case already lost by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to strip Feodor Fedorenko, of his US citizenship and deport him to the Soviet Union. Fedorenko was alleged to have been a guard at a Jewish ghetto and at Treblinka extermination camp, where a total of 800,000 Jews had been murdered by the Nazis. Ryan considered himself a prosecutor rather than a Nazi-hunter, but he came to believe the case was important and recommended that it be pursued. He won the case in the court of appeals, and the Supreme Court later upheld the appeals court&#x27;s ruling. That case, &quot;Fedorenko v. United States&quot;, became OSI&#x27;s seminal case that set important legal precedent and led to Ryan&#x27;s being asked to serve as the second Director of OSI, following the brief tenure of Walter Rockler. In 1984, Fedorenko was deported to the Soviet Union after being denaturalized. There, he was arrested and put on trial for treason, war crimes, and collaborationism for working in Treblinka extermination camp. Fedorenko was found guilty, sentenced to death, and executed in 1987.

==Early challenges==
Ryan led the organization during its formative years, from 1980 to 1983, navigating a difficult political landscape. He established the importance of historical research in addition to criminal investigation and won precedent-setting cases. OSI&#x27;s approach was to identify those who met the criteria for being Nazi war criminals, determine whether they had lied about their wartime activities when applying for entry into the U.S or for U.S. citizenship and, if so, strip them of their citizenship and deport them. Initial leads came passively from existing INS cases, Jewish organizations also searching for war criminals, and individuals who by chance come across their former tormentors. OSI emphasis on historical research soon enabled the organization to become proactive in developing leads and it ultimately becoming a resource for Holocaust and other World War II research well beyond OSI&#x27;s mandate to prosecute.

===Disagreements over OSI operations===
As the work began, OSI faced widespread disagreement on many important issues. Some felt the effort to expel World War II war criminals was important both to achieve justice and to set precedent for the future, while others felt that the time had passed for pursuit of these aims. Some Justice Department officials felt OSI should have a Jewish Director, while others did not want the office to be viewed as a Jewish organization and favored Ryan as director in part because he was not Jewish. Eastern European nationality groups opposed OSI&#x27;s use of evidence from the USSR, which had an interest in discrediting Baltic State, Ukrainian, and other emigre groups and might well provide false information and forged documents to achieve their aims. These emigre groups also challenged the use of the lower standard of evidence involved in civil trials compared to criminal trials, even though citizenship revocation and deportation were civil issues and US law at the time did not provide for criminal penalties for crimes committed on foreign soil unless against US citizens. The emigres also feared that OSI might seek to deport anyone who had lied on their entry applications, not just the wartime persecutors that OSI sought to expel. In contrast, Jewish groups were pressing for more determined action by OSI than INS had demonstrated. It became clear that leading OSI was going to involve a lot of public relations work as well as research and prosecution.

===Disagreements over who should be prosecuted===
From the beginning, OSI had to deal with disagreements over who should be prosecuted. In contrast to the Fedorenko case, which the INS had lost and OSI had won on appeal, the Walus case had been lost on appeal by the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office in Chicago with the court ordering a retrial. Director Ryan counseled against pursuing the case. The documentary evidence was weak and the eyewitnesses, forty years after the fact, were unconvincing. It was even possible that this was a case of mistaken identity. According to Judith Feigin, OSI&#x27;s historian, it took courage in 1981 for OSI to dismiss the Walus case. Frank Walus had come to the attention of INS in 1974 by a letter from Simon Wiesenthal, a highly respected Holocaust survivor and acclaimed Nazi hunter. Several Holocaust survivors had traveled to America from Israel and emotionally confronted Walus, whom they believed to be their former tormentor, in court. Furthermore, OSI had not yet won the confidence of the Jewish community, whose support could be important for the organization&#x27;s success. OSI could expect a negative reaction for not pursuing Walus.

==Representative cases prosecuted==
By the middle of 1984, forty cases had been filed by OSI against war criminals then living in America. Through the next few years, OSI successfully prosecuted over 130 other cases involving persons complicit in Nazi war crimes and subsequently living quietly in America. Many of these cases are discussed in detail in the OSI history produced in 2006. Three such cases in which OSI sought expulsion reached the Supreme Court.

Most cases involved relatively low level camp guards who had beaten or executed prisoners or had led them to places of execution. Juozas Kungys, for example, was prosecuted because OSI determined he had &quot;rounded up and transported thousands of Jews to an execution site, distributed firearms and ammunition to an execution squad, forced the victims into a mass grave, shot some of them, and exhorted the execution squad to do the same. Other cases involved high-ranking officials and prominent Nazi collaborators.

In many cases, the individual charged left the U.S. voluntarily rather than face deportation proceedings. In many other cases, naturalized individuals agreed to give up U.S. citizenship but were allowed to remain in the U.S due to ill health rather than be deported. In some cases deportation was complicated by there being no country willing to accept the deportee.

Not every case was brought to a satisfactory conclusion. Case law evolved over time with various court rulings regarding legally complex matters of interpretation of statutes and sufficiency of evidence. Sometimes compromises were required. In the case of Kungys, an agreement was reached for him to give up his citizenship but not be deported. Due to the delayed pursuit of justice, many subjects of OSI prosecution died before their cases could be taken to completion in the U.S. or in other countries.

Some representative cases are included below. The dates in parentheses indicate the period during which INS, OSI, or HRSP were pursuing legal action against the individual.

===Andrija Artuković (1951–1986)===
Andrija Artuković was a construction worker in California. During the war, he had been a senior official in occupied Croatia. His decrees called for internment and execution of &quot;undesirables&quot; such as Serbs Jews, Gypsies, Orthodox Christians, and Communists. Hundreds of thousands of Serbs and Jews were massacred as a result. He was extradited to Yugoslavia in 1986, tried, convicted, and sentenced to death by firing squad. Due to his poor health, execution was deferred, and he died of natural causes in 1988 in a prison hospital. The litigation over this high ranking Nazi collaborator was the longest experienced by INS and OSI.

===Valerian Trifa (1975–1982)===
Valerian Trifa, as archbishop of the Romanian Orthodox Episcopate in Grass Lake, Michigan, was a powerful and influential religious figure in the U.S. At one point, he even presented the opening invocation for the U.S. Senate. During the war, he had been a propagandist and member of Romania&#x27;s fascist Iron Guard. His anti-Semitic writings provoked riots resulting in torture and murder of hundreds of Jews. As OSI was preparing to take him to trial, Trifa surrendered his citizenship and was ultimately deported to Portugal. Portugal later tried to deport him as well, but he died of a heart attack before this could be completed.

===Wolodymir Osidach (1979–1981)===
Wolodymir Osidach was a retired slaughterhouse worker in Philadelphia who, during the war, had been an officer in the Ukrainian police force at Rava Raska that helped the Germans round up 14,000 Jews for transportation to the Belzec extermination camp. In November 1979, the OSI filed a complaint that Osidach had lied about his wartime activities when he successfully applied for entry into the United States in 1949 as a Displaced Person. This was the first case handled by the newly created OSI from beginning to end and the first it took to trial. Without determining whether Osidach was responsible for specific atrocities, the judge agreed that Osidach had fraudulently entered the US and subsequently obtained US citizenship. Accordingly, in 1981, the judge stripped Osidach of his naturalized citizenship, opening the way for his deportation. Osidach died of a heart attack before deportation hearings commenced.

===Otto von Bolschwing (1979–1982)===
Otto von Bolschwing worked for a computer leasing company in California where he rose to the level of vice president. During the war, he had been the chief SS intelligence officer in Romania. He worked with Adolf Eichmann to devise programs that persecuted Germany&#x27;s Jews. After the war, he worked for the Central Intelligence Agency before emigrating to America. Rather than contest the OSI complaint against him, Bolschwing agreed to surrender his citizenship. He died before deportation proceedings were initiated. He was the highest ranking German prosecuted by OSI.

===Karl Linnas (1979–1987)===
Karl Linnas worked as a land surveyor living in Greenlawn, New York. During the war, he had been head of an Estonian concentration camp during the Nazi occupation. Kneeling prisoners were shot on his orders. The Soviets convicted him &quot;in absentia&quot; for having taken an active part in 12,000 murders and wanted him extradited. After extensive legal proceedings, Linnas was ultimately sent to the U.S.S.R., where he died in a prison hospital.

===Johann Breyer (1992–2014)===
Johann Breyer was a tool and die maker for an engineering company in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. During the war, he had been a member of the Death&#x27;s Head Battalion of the Waffen-SS acting as a guard at Buchenwald and Auschwitz, at which he was accused as an accessory in the murder of 216,000 Jews. He came to the U.S. in 1952 and became a naturalized citizen in 1957. Denaturalization proceedings were complicated by his mother&#x27;s claim that she had been born in the U.S. and that Breyer was only seventeen years old when he began service with the SS. After the &quot;most arcane and convoluted litigation in OSI history,&quot; the courts ultimately blocked OSI&#x27;s efforts to strip Breyer of his U.S. citizenship. No deportation proceedings were then possible. In 2013, however, Germany requested that Breyer be extradited. He was arrested but died at age 89 before an extradition hearing could begin.

===Juozas Budreika (1994–1996)===
Juozas Budreika was a retired cook in Gulfport, Florida. During the war he had been a member of the 2nd/12th Lithuanian &quot;Schutzmannschaft&quot; (Protective Detachment) Battalion, a mobile killing unit that murdered thousands of unarmed Jews and other civilians in Lithuania and Byelorussia. He agreed to forfeit his citizenship and relocate to Lithuania, where he died shortly after his arrival.

===Algimantas Dailidė (1994–2003)===
Algimantas Dailidė was a retired Cleveland, Ohio real estate agent living in Gulfport, Florida. During the war, he was a member of the Lithuanian Security Police (the Saugumas) that arrested Jews who attempted to escape from the Vilnius ghetto and turned them over to the Nazis. Such people were generally shot outside Vilnius at the Paneriai execution pits, where about 50,000 Jews were murdered. His U.S. citizenship was revoked in 1997, and he was ordered deported to Lithuania in 2002. In 2006, he was convicted by a Lithuanian court of persecuting civilians but, because of his age, he was not sentenced to prison. He died in Europe in 2015 and was buried in Ohio.

===Demjanjuk controversy (1975–2009)===
A highly controversial and widely publicized case involved Ivan (aka John) Demjanjuk, who was ultimately convicted in 2011 in Germany as an accessory in the murder of 28,000 Jews while a guard at Sobibor extermination camp in occupied Poland. This conviction was the culmination of determined prosecutorial efforts over thirty years in three countries. Legal scholar Lawrence Douglas, who wrote a detailed history of the Demjanjuk case, concluded in 2016 that, in spite of serious missteps along the way, the German verdict brought the case &quot;to a worthy and just conclusion&quot; that &quot;never would have happened without the stubborn exertions of the OSI.

The controversy stemmed from OSI&#x27;s initially mistaking Demjanjuk&#x27;s identity and proceeding with denaturalization action against him in the belief that he was the notorious, sadistic guard known as &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot; at Treblinka extermination camp. OSI had obtained conflicting evidence from documents and eyewitnesses as to Demjanjuk&#x27;s description and location during the war that led one member of the prosecution team to recommend not pursuing the case. Others were convinced at the time that Demjunjuk was &quot;Ivan&quot; and the case went forward. At his U.S. denaturalization trial in 1981, Demjanjuk was judged to be the Treblinka guard &quot;Ivan&quot; and the U.S. citizenship he had obtained in 1958 was revoked. In separate, subsequent proceedings, it was further determined that he was deportable and extraditable. At the request of the government of Israel, he was extradited to face trial there for war crimes. In 1988, after a fourteen-month trial, it was again determined that Demjanjuk was &quot;Ivan the Terrible.&quot; He was found guilty of war crimes and sentenced to death.

During the period that Demjunjuk&#x27;s Israeli conviction was on appeal, the Soviet Union collapsed. New evidence became available in 1991 from behind the former Iron Curtain that strongly indicated that Demjunjuk had not been at Treblinka (and therefore was not &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot;) but had been at other notorious camps, including Trawniki, Sobibor, Flossenburg and Majdaek. Demjunjuk&#x27;s defense team in the U.S. used this new evidence, along with allegations of improprieties by the OSI, to overturn both the denaturalization decision as well as the later extradition decision. In 1993, the Israeli Supreme court also acquitted Demjanjuk of charges related to the actions of &quot;Ivan the Terrible,&quot; even though there was considerable evidence of his being involved with war crimes at other camps. Demjanjuk was freed and, although no longer a U.S. citizen, he was returned to the United States.

In obtaining this favorable result for their client, Demjanjuk&#x27;s defense teams in the U.S. and Israel accused OSI of improperly withholding evidence that should have been disclosed because it was potentially useful to their client. They further accused OSI of intentionally presenting falsified evidence, and improperly influencing witnesses. OSI denied all these charges.

These accusations prompted seven separate investigations looking for evidence of prosecutorial or ethical misconduct. They were conducted by three separate investigative bodies between 1987 and 1993. First, the Appeals Court appointed a Special Master, Federal District Court Judge Thomas A. Wiseman, Jr., who conducted a six-month inquiry resulting in a 210-page report. Wiseman concluded that OSI prosecutors &quot;did not intend to violate the Rules or their ethical obligations.&quot; They had cooperated fully in his investigation, testified truthfully, and were &quot;principled, albeit fallible.&quot; Wiseman found no prosecutorial misconduct. Second, the District of Columbia Bar reviewed the conduct of both director Ryan and the attorney assigned to the case. It also found no wrongdoing. Third, the Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) conducted a total of five internal inquiries into various aspects of the prosecution. One was at the request of OSI itself and another at the request of Demjanjuk&#x27;s defense team. These investigations also concluded that there had been no improper conduct. Another OPR investigation was made at the request of Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Gilbert S. Merritt, Jr., who had presided during the Demjanjuk denaturalization hearing and was highly critical of the prosecution, including a charge that &quot;Jewish special interest groups&quot; had influenced Ryan and the OSI. OPR found no merit to these charges. In short, all investigations, internal and external, of OSI&#x27;s conduct in the prosecution of Demjanjuk concluded that there had been no intentional wrongdoing.

Nonetheless, the Appeals Court concluded that the government had defined too narrowly its duty to disclose potentially useful documents to the defense. Accordingly, in 1998, the Appeals Court rescinded its extradition order. In subsequent actions, based on the determination of the Appeals Court, Demjanjuk&#x27;s deportation order was nullified and his U.S. citizenship restored. Further, the Court ruled that, because the civil actions regarding denaturalization and deportation were based upon allegations of criminal activity on the part of a defendant, henceforth OSI would have to use the more exacting rules of disclosure required by criminal proceedings. Lawrence Douglas characterized the court&#x27;s action as &quot;surprising&quot; and particularly remarkable since the court &quot;admonished the OSI for failing to satisfy a standard that the court had only just imposed.&quot;

Undeterred, and using the documents that became available since 1991 that had helped Demjanjuk establish he was not Ivan The Terrible, OSI filed a new complaint in 1999 seeking denaturalization, now based upon Demjanjuk&#x27;s correct identity and his service at Trawniki, Sobibor, Majdanek, and Flossenburg. For a second time, Demjanjuk was stripped of his citizenship. Through multiple appeals and other legal maneuvering, Demjanjuk&#x27;s defense team successfully delayed his deportation, this time to Germany, until 2009 and delayed conclusion of his trial there until 2011. After 91 days of trial, he was convicted on 16 counts as an accessory to the murder of over 28,000 Jews at Sobibor extermination camp during 1943. Accordingly, he was sentenced to five years in prison.

Again Demjanjuk appealed, but he died before the appeal was heard. His attorneys unsuccessfully appealed to have his citizenship restored posthumously. His relatives successfully arranged for his burial in Ohio, near where he used to live.

The controversy surrounding Demjanjuk&#x27;s mistaken identity received extensive publicity in the U.S. His ultimate conviction for war crimes decades later in Germany did not. As a result, according to historian Judith Feigin, &quot;many members of the public still know of OSI [only] as the mistaken prosecutor of Ivan the Terrible&quot; and not the successful prosecutor of a Nazi war criminal.

==Report on Klaus Barbie (1983)==
In 1983, near the end of Allan Ryan&#x27;s directorship at OSI, he was asked to investigate the relationship between Klaus Barbie and the U.S. government following World War II. As Gestapo chief in Lyon, France, Barbie personally beat and tortured men, women, and children, reportedly laughing as he did so. His methods included whipping, electric shocks, breaking arms and legs, and sexual abuse, earning him the title &quot;Butcher of Lyon.&quot; He also deported Jewish children to Auschwitz concentration camp, where they were murdered. Barbie was ultimately found in Bolivia, extradited to France, convicted of crimes against humanity, and sentenced to life imprisonment. The questions about American involvement were, as America&#x27;s focus shifted from the threat from Nazis to the threat from communism, was Barbie recruited to serve as a U.S. agent in Germany and, when French officials sought to bring Barbie to justice, did the U.S. government help him escape to Bolivia.

Ryan&#x27;s thoroughly researched report to the Attorney General concluded that &quot;officers of the United States government were directly responsible for protecting a person wanted by the government of France on criminal charges and in arranging his escape from the law.&quot; Ryan felt that the initial decision for the U.S. Government to use Barbie during Cold War counter-intelligence work, while reprehensible in light of his war-crimes, might be defended in light of national security interests. Doing so was no different from what other World War II victor nations were doing at the time, and it may have been done without thorough knowledge of Barbie&#x27;s atrocities in Lyon. After those atrocities became well publicized, however, Ryan regarded it as indefensible for U.S. Counter Intelligence Corp. personnel to lie to higher U.S. authorities and help Barbie escape Europe to Bolivia rather than honor an outstanding French warrant for his arrest.

As a result of Ryan&#x27;s report and personal recommendation, the U.S. government made a formal apology to France for enabling Barbie to escape French justice for thirty-three years. Although some politicians and commentators did not agree with all the conclusions or believe the apology was justified, reaction to the report was generally highly favorable, both in the U.S. and abroad. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; applauded the report&#x27;s &quot;candor and balance&quot; and regarded it as &quot;a credit to the Justice Department and particularly to its principal author, Allan A. Ryan, Jr.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; believed the report would be one that &quot;serves history and invites us to learn from it.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; further wrote &quot;How rare it is for a proud and powerful nation to admit shabby behavior.&quot; French and German newspapers also praised the report, with one noting America&#x27;s &quot;powerful and impressive capacity for democratic self-purging.&quot; The quality of Ryan&#x27;s report on Klaus Barbie, in the words of OSI historian Judith Feigin, &quot;helped establish OSI as an essential resource for persons dealing with World War II issues.&quot;

==Directors of OSI==
Walter Rockler was the first director of OSI, serving for seven months in 1979 and 1980. From 1947 to 1949, he had successfully prosecuted Nazi-era German bankers and industrialists during the Nuremberg trials. Allan Ryan was the second director and served during its formative years from 1980 to 1983. Neal Sher was the third OSI director, serving from 1983 to 1994. He left OSI to head the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). The last Director was Eli Rosenbaum, who had served as a trial attorney for OSI from 1980 to 1984. After time as a corporate litigator and general counsel, he returned to OSI in 1988 as Deputy Director. He became Director in 1995 and served in that capacity until 2010, when OSI was merged with the Domestic Security Section of the Justice Department Criminal Division to form a new unit, the Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section. Rosenbaum then became the Director of Human Rights Enforcement Strategy and Policy at HRSP.

==Awards==
OSI was a 2021 recipient of The Elie Wiesel Award, the highest award of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. The award was established in 2011 and recognizes &quot;internationally prominent individuals whose actions embody the Museum&#x27;s vision of a world where people confront hate, prevent genocide, and promote human dignity.&quot;

<text>New Utrecht Reformed Church is the fourth oldest Reformed Church in America congregation and is located in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, New York. The church was established in 1677 by ethnic Dutch residents in the town of New Utrecht, Brooklyn, several years after the English took over New Netherland. It is affiliated with the Reformed Church in America, a Protestant denomination. The cemetery was consecrated in 1654; 1300 dead are interred there. The Liberty Pole, the sixth on the site of the present church, was originally erected in 1783 at the end of the Revolutionary War to harass departing British troops.

The present church was built in 1828 of stones taken from the original church, built in 1700. Construction was supervised by US Army engineer, Rene Edward De Russy, who led the construction of Fort Hamilton at New York harbor. The parish house was built in 1892 and the parsonage in 1906.

The church was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1966; the parish house and the cemetery received landmark status in 1998. Both the church and the cemetery are listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="666553" wikidata="Q872503" url="?curid=666553" title="Cucumber sandwich">
<text>The traditional cucumber sandwich is a crustless tea sandwich (or finger sandwich) composed of thin slices of cucumber situated between two thin slices of lightly buttered white bread. The sandwich originated with British colonists in India.

Cucumber sandwiches are most often served for a light snack or for afternoon tea, a formal light meal served in the late afternoon, or in the early evening before the main supper. Cucumber sandwiches are also traditionally served in the tea break at club cricket matches in England.

==Cultural and historical associations==
Cucumber sandwiches formed an integral part of the stereotypical afternoon tea affair. By contrast, people of the era&#x27;s lower working classes were thought to prefer a coarser but more satisfying protein-filled sandwich, in a &quot;meat tea&quot; that might substitute for supper.

Some writers have attempted to draw out an association between the daintiness of the sandwich and the perceived effeteness of the UK&#x27;s aristocracy. As a result, cucumber sandwiches are often used in novels and films as a means to identify upper-class people, occasionally in a derogatory manner. In the first act of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; (1895), cucumber sandwiches that have expressly been ordered and prepared for Lady Bracknell&#x27;s expected visit are all voraciously eaten beforehand by her nephew and host, Algernon Moncrieff; consequently he is forced to tell a little lie, with his butler&#x27;s connivance: namely that &quot;there were no cucumbers in the market this morning... not even for ready money&quot;. In addition, the sandwiches were once considered appropriate delicacies to offer to visiting clergy, in times when such visits were still a common feature of English middle class life.

The popularity of the cucumber sandwich as an upper-class &quot;dainty&quot; reached its zenith in the Edwardian era, when cheap labour and plentiful coal enabled new techniques of producing cucumbers in hotbeds under glass through most of the year. With the declining popularity of tea as a meal in the United Kingdom, there was a corresponding decline in the popularity of cucumber sandwiches, but they are still frequently served at teas, luncheons, and gatherings. Most English cricket clubs supply malt vinegar and ground pepper to dash inside the sandwich, and this is the simplest form commonly used in England.

Cucumber sandwiches are often eaten in the summer months or in warmer climates, such as in parts of India. The English influence on Indian culture has made the sandwiches popular during cricket matches and weekend picnics. The Indian variant is flavoured with green chutney and occasionally includes slices of boiled potatoes. Indian Airlines served cucumber sandwiches as part of its usual vegetarian inflight meal in short-haul domestic flights, until its merger in 2011.

==Preparation==

The most basic version of this sandwich consists of bread and cucumber slices. One recipe from 1919 gives the following instructions:

&quot;Spread white bread with butter and a dash of mayonnaise dressing. Slice fresh cucumbers, soak in salt water, dip in vinegar and drain. Put between two bread slices and serve immediately.&quot;

Variants include the addition of chopped mint, meat (e.g. chicken), or may substitute brown bread.

<text>Uzbekistan is divided into 12 regions (&quot;viloyatlar&quot;, singularviloyat, &quot;viloyati&quot; in compound, e.g. Toshkent &quot;viloyati&quot;), 1 autonomous republic (&quot;respublika&quot;, &quot;respublikasi&quot; in compound, e.g. Qaraqalpaqstan Avtonom &quot;Respublikasi&quot;), and 1 independent city (&quot;shahar&quot; or &quot;shahri&quot; in compounds, e.g. Toshkent &quot;shahri&quot;). 

== List ==
Names are given below in the Uzbek language, although numerous variations of the transliterations of each name exist. The regions in turn are divided into 175 districts (&quot;tumanlar&quot;, singular &quot;tuman&quot;).


==Enclaves and exclaves==
There are four Uzbek exclaves, all of them surrounded by Kyrgyz territory in the Fergana Valley region where Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan meet. Two of them are the towns of Sokh, area of with a population of 42,800 in 1993 (with some estimates as high as 70,000, of which 99% are Tajiks and the remainder Uzbeks) and Shohimardon, area of with a population of 5,100 in 1993 (91% are Uzbeks and the remainder Kyrgyz). The other two are the tiny territories of (or Qalacha), roughly long and wide, and (or Dzhangail), a dot of land barely across. Chon-Qora is on the Sokh river, between the Uzbek border and the Sokh exclave.

Uzbekistan has a Tajikistan enclave, the village of Sarvan, which includes a narrow, long strip of land about long and wide, along the road from Angren to Kokand. 

The Kyrgyz village of Barak (population 627) lies 15 km north of Osh. In August 1999, the area around Barak was occupied by Uzbekistan, cutting it off from Kyrgyz territory. Uzbek forces dug up and blockaded the road to Ak-Tash while also allegedly seizing large areas of Kyrgyz land that had been loaned in the Soviet era but never returned. They entrenched themselves within much of Kyrgyz border territory and refused to leave. Barak became a &quot;de facto&quot; enclave only 1.5 km from the shifted main border. (Map) In August 2018 Kyrgyz and Uzbek authorities agreed to a land swap that would eliminate the exclave. The exchange process may take up to two years.

<doc id="666557" wikidata="Q1520951" url="?curid=666557" title="Queen Gwendolen">
<text>Gwendolen, also known as &quot;Gwendolin&quot;, or &quot;Gwendolyn&quot; (Latin: Guendoloēna) was a legendary ruler of ancient Britain. She came to power in 1115BC.

As told by Geoffrey of Monmouth in his historical account &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, she was the repudiated queen of King Locrinus until she defeated her husband in battle at the River Stour. This river was the dividing line between Cornwall and Loegria, two key locations in ancient Britain. After defeating the king, she took on the leadership of the Britons, becoming their first queen regnant.

== Life ==
According to Geoffrey of Monmouth, Gwendolen was one of the daughters of Corineus, king of Cornwall, and one of Brutus&#x27;s warriors. Gwendolen was married to Locrinus, the eldest of King Brutus&#x27; three sons, and had a son named Maddan. Upon her father Corineus&#x27; death, Locrinus divorced her in favour of his Germanic mistress, Estrildis (by whom he already had a daughter who was named Habren). Gwendolen then fled to Cornwall, where she lived for a few years. After having built up a large army, she waged war against her ex-husband, King Locrinus. In a battle near the River Stour, Locrinus was killed. Gwendolen then assumed his throne and ruled independently, as her father had reigned in Cornwall. After having both her husband&#x27;s mistress, Estrildis, and her daughter, Habren, drowned in the River Severn (Old Welsh: Habren), the ancient British monarch reigned peacefully for fifteen years. She then abdicated in favour of her son and lived out the remainder of her life in Cornwall.

== Legacy ==
The &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; says that at the time of her death Samuel was judge in Judaea, Aeneas Silvius was ruling Alba Longa, and Homer was gaining fame in Greece. She is mentioned in Spenser&#x27;s poem &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; (1590) as Gwendolene, and appears in the mythopoeic writings of William Blake as one of the twelve Daughters of Albion. In the 20th century feminist critics have cited her as an example of a powerful woman healing a fractured Britain with her rule.

<doc id="666560" wikidata="Q2355706" url="?curid=666560" title="Kudu">
<text>The kudus are two species of antelope of the genus &quot;Tragelaphus&quot;:

* Lesser kudu, &quot;Tragelaphus imberbis&quot;, of eastern Africa
* Greater kudu, &quot;Tragelaphus strepsiceros&quot;, of eastern and southern Africa
The two species look similar, though greaters are larger than lessers. A large adult male greater kudu stands over tall at the shoulder, and a large male lesser kudu stands about tall. Males of both species have long horns, which point upward and slightly back, curling in a corkscrew shape.

==Etymology==
The name of the animal was imported into English in the 18th century from isiXhosa &quot;iqhude&quot;, via Afrikaans &quot;koedoe&quot;.

Kudu, or koodoo, is the Khoikhoi and seTswana name (Tholo is the Setswana name) for this antelope. &quot;Tragos&quot; (Greek) denotes a he-goat and &quot;elaphos&quot; (Greek) a deer. &quot;Strepho&quot; (Greek) means &quot;I twist&quot;, and &quot;strephis&quot; is &quot;twisting&quot;. &quot;Keras&quot; (Greek) means &quot;horn&quot;.

==Habitat==
Lesser kudus occupy savanna near &quot;Acacia&quot; and &quot;Commiphora&quot; shrubs. They rely on thickets for protection, so they are rarely seen in the open. Their brown and striped pelts help to camouflage them in scrub environments.

== Behavior ==

As in many other antelopes, male kudus can be found in bachelor groups, but they are more likely to be solitary. Their dominance displays tend not to last long and are generally fairly peaceful, consisting of one male making himself look big by making his hair stand on end. When males do have a face-off, they will lock their horns in a competition to determine the stronger puller; kudus&#x27; necks enlarge during the mating season for this reason. Sometimes two competing males are unable to unlock their horns and, if unable to disengage, will die of starvation or dehydration. Males are seen with females only in the mating season, when they join in groups of 5–15 kudus, including offspring. Calves grow quickly and at six months are largely independent of their mothers.

A pregnant female will leave the herd to give birth to a single offspring. She will leave the newborn lying hidden for 4–5 weeks while coming back only to nurse it, which is the longest nursing period of any antelope species. Then the calf will start accompanying its mother for short periods. At 3 or 4 months, the calf will be with its mother constantly, and at about six months they will rejoin the group.

When threatened, kudu will often run away rather than fight. Wounded bulls have been known to charge an attacker, hitting the attacker with their sturdy horn base rather than stabbing it. Wounded females can keep running for many miles without stopping to rest for more than a minute. They have a powerful kick and are capable of breaking a wild dog&#x27;s or jackal&#x27;s neck or back. They are good jumpers and can clear a 5-foot fence from a standing start.

==Diet==
Kudus are browsers and eat leaves and shoots. In dry seasons they eat wild watermelons and other fruit for their liquid content and natural sugars. The lesser kudu is less dependent on water sources than the greater kudu.

==Predators and threats==
Predators, such as lions, leopards, cheetahs, wild dogs, hyenas, crocodiles and sometimes pythons, hunt adult kudu or their young. Kudu numbers are also affected by humans hunting them for their meat, hides and horns, or using their habitats for charcoal burning and farming.

Kudus were highly susceptible to the rinderpest virus (now eradicated after a vaccination program in domestic cattle), and many scientists believe that, in earlier times, recurring epidemics of the disease reduced kudu populations in East Africa.

Kudus are susceptible to rabies in times of extended drought. They have been known to enter farm houses and other buildings when infected. Infected animals appear tame and have a distinct frothing at the mouth. Rabid kudu are fearless, and bulls may sometimes attack humans who get too close.

==Meat==
Kudu meat is similar to venison (deer), with a slight gamey, liver-like flavor. It is a very dry and lean meat, so it needs to be cooked carefully to avoid drying it out.

==In music and culture==

A kudu horn is a musical instrument made from the horn of the kudu. A form of it is sometimes used as a shofar in Jewish ceremonies. It is seen in the Western world in its use as a part of the Scouting movement&#x27;s Wood Badge training program; the sounding of the horn signals the start of a Wood Badge training course or activity. A horn of this shape, when used by football fans, is called &quot;kuduzela&quot; (a portmanteau of &quot;kudu&quot; and &quot;vuvuzela&quot;). 

The kudu, &quot;tholo&quot; in the languages of Sepedi, Setswana and Venda, is a tribal totem of the Barolong and Batlhaping people of Botswana and South Africa.

In the sport of kudu dung-spitting, contestants spit pellets of kudu dung, with the farthest distance (including the roll) reached being the winner. The sport is mostly popular among the Afrikaner community in South Africa, and a world championship is held each year.

Kudu-hunting is prominently featured in Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s nonfiction book &quot;Green Hills of Africa&quot;, an account of a month-long safari he and his then-wife, Pauline Pfeiffer, went on in East Africa in December 1933.

Hannigan has worked with the Philharmonia Orchestra, The Skywalker Symphony Orchestra, The Slovak Symphony Orchestra, The Budapest Film Orchestra, and The Chamber Orchestra of London, recording at Abbey Road Studios, AIR Studios and Skywalker Ranch. The composer is known to be an analogue synthesizer enthusiast. 

== The Sandman (Audible Originals/DC Comics) and other audio production ==
On July 15, 2020, Audible released an adaptation of the comic book series as a multi-part audio drama directed by Dirk Maggs with music by James Hannigan. The voice cast included Gaiman as the Narrator, James McAvoy as Dream, Kat Dennings as Death, Taron Egerton as John Constantine, Michael Sheen as Lucifer, Riz Ahmed as the Corinthian, Andy Serkis as Matthew the Raven, Samantha Morton as Urania Blackwell, Bebe Neuwirth as The Siamese Cat, Arthur Darvill as William Shakespeare, and Justin Vivian Bond as Desire. The production spent two months at #1 in The New York Times Best Seller list

The follow-up, &quot;The Sandman: Act II,&quot; was released on 22 September 2021, and featured most of the original cast. New additions to the cast included: Regé-Jean Page as Orpheus, Jeffrey Wright as Destiny, Brian Cox as Augustus, Emma Corrin as Thessaly, John Lithgow as Joshua Norton, David Tennant as Loki, Bill Nighy as Odin, Kristen Schaal as Delirium, Kevin Smith as Merv Pumpkinhead, and Niamh Walsh as Nuala. Neuwirth also returned, but portrayed Bast.

In &quot;The Sandman: Act III&quot;, actor Regé-Jean Page was heard singing Hannigan&#x27;s &quot;The Song of Orpheus&quot; in English, in the episode of the same name. The composer posted footage of the orchestral session on YouTube. 

Hannigan has also scored the Audi-award winning &quot;Alien&quot; series of Audible Originals, including &quot;Alien: Out of the Shadows&quot;, &quot;Alien: River of Pain&quot;, &quot;Alien: Sea of Sorrows&quot;, and &quot;Alien 3,&quot; with series cast members including Michael Biehn, Lance Henriksen, and Rutger Hauer. The series was directed by Dirk Maggs.

Hannigan composed music introducing the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series of audiobooks read by Stephen Fry, the intro music for Penguin Random House Audio&#x27;s production of Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Discworld,&quot; along with the full-cast audio drama &quot;Unseen Academicals&quot;. The Discworld main audiobook theme was released on Spotify in 2024. His music has also been heard in BBC Radio 4 productions including &quot;Neverwhere&quot; and &quot;Good Omens. Neverwhere&quot; featured cast members such as Benedict Cumberbatch, James McAvoy, and the late Christopher Lee.

== Interactive music career ==

In the early years of his career in the 1990s, Hannigan worked as composer for Electronic Arts Europe before basing his studio at Pinewood Studios in England for ten years between 1997 and 2007, where he sometimes worked as a sound designer on films alongside composing. His sound design credits include New Line Cinema&#x27;s &quot;Lost in Space,&quot; which was nominated for a Golden Reel Award. 

At EA, Hannigan became involved in devising interactive music playback systems for video games during the early days of digital audio and streaming, and went on to form a strong working relationship with the company. His early work at EA included God games such as &quot;Beasts and Bumpkins&quot;, EA Sports titles in the &quot;F1&quot; and &quot;FIFA&quot; series, &quot;Privateer 2: The Darkening&quot;, and various entries in the &quot;Theme Park&quot; series including &quot;Theme Park World&quot; (US title: Sim Theme Park) and &quot;Theme Park Inc.&quot; 

In the course of his career, Hannigan has worked with several well-known figures from the chip music and 8-bit gaming era, including Richard Joseph, Mark Knight, and Commodore 64 maestro, Martin Galway. The former two were among the first to invite Hannigan into the games industry during the early 1990s to compose for titles such as &quot;&quot; and &quot;Flight of the Amazon Queen&quot;, while Martin Galway, then Audio Director at Digital Anvil and working on several titles for Chris Roberts, invited Hannigan to compose for &quot;&quot; and &quot;Freelancer&quot;. Hannigan had earlier worked on Wing Commander related titles such as &quot;Privateer 2: The Darkening&quot;. 

&quot;Privateer 2&quot; featured Full-motion video and its movie component starred Christopher Walken, John Hurt, and Clive Owen. The composer would later work on other games integrating full-cast film productions, such as &quot;Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3&quot; with a cast including Tim Curry, J. K. Simmons, and Jonathan Pryce, and later, &quot;Command &amp; Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight.&quot; 

Freelancer&#x27;s soundtrack was released on Nile Rodgers&#x27; &quot;Sumthing Else Music Works&quot; label in 2003, but was subsequently removed when the company went out of business in 2010. 

Certain cues for &quot;Conquest: Frontier Wars&quot; and &quot;Freelancer&quot; were recorded by Hannigan with a full orchestra, unusual during this era of game development. 

One of Hannigan&#x27;s best-known themes is &quot;Red Alert 3 Theme: Soviet March,&quot; which has been streamed hundreds of millions of times on platforms such as YouTube, and over 27 million times on Spotify at the time of writing. The theme, along with other cues including Frank Klepacki&#x27;s &quot;Hell March 3&quot;, was recorded with the Skywalker Symphony Orchestra at Skywalker Sound in Marin County, California. &quot;Soviet March&quot;, a parodic take on Soviet-era military music, has become a widespread internet meme, and has even been used, seemingly unironically, as background music in official videos from Russian space agency Roscosmos. 

Hannigan has posted videos on the subject of his early interactive music system design for titles such as &quot;&quot; (designed by Google DeepMind founder Demis Hassabis) on YouTube. The composer would go on to score the fully orchestral &quot;Evil Genius&quot;, also developed by Hassabis&#x27;s company, Elixir Studios, and each game would receive BAFTA nominations for Original Music at the BAFTA Games Awards in 2003 and 2004 respectively.

James Hannigan provided music for the videogame &quot;Infestation&quot; in 1999&quot;,&quot; created by Frontier Developments. In an article posted on the composer&#x27;s website entitled &quot;Press Start to Compose&quot; Hannigan describes himself as a BBC Micro, &quot;Elite&quot; and David Braben fan, citing his work on &quot;Infestation&quot; for Braben&#x27;s company as an &quot;early career bucket-list moment&quot;&quot;. &quot; He also talks about his collection of vintage arcade machines.

In 2018, James Hannigan and Jagex released an orchestral album of &quot;Runescape&quot; music featuring orchestral renditions on earlier Runescape tunes along with new music by Hannigan, entitled &quot;Runescape: The Orchestral Collection.&quot; The album was recorded at Abbey Road Studio 1 in London with the Philharmonia Orchestra and conducted by Allan Wilson. Earlier, in 2013, Hannigan had recorded several new orchestral cues for RuneScape 3 with the Slovak Radio Symphony Orchestra.

In 2015, Hannigan contributed music for &quot;Terraria: Otherworld&quot;, which was subsequently cancelled. A soundtrack was later released and some of the music has been used in the main Terraria game. After a period away from games, Hannigan returned to the industry to score &quot;Steelrising&quot; and &quot;Evil Genius 2&quot; in 2021.

Some of Hannigan&#x27;s other game credits include &quot;Dead Space 3&quot;, &quot;Steelrising&quot;, &quot;Transformers Universe&quot;, &quot;FA Premier League Manager, Art Academy&quot;, &quot;Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs,&quot; &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;, &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;, &quot;Catwoman&quot;, &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;, &quot;Grand Prix 4&quot;, &quot;F1 2000&quot;, and &quot;Call of Antia.&quot; The composer recorded his Harry Potter scores at Air studios and Abbey Road Studios with Philharmonia Orchestra. Soundtracks were released for &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;, but later withdrawn when Electronic Arts lost its license to create Harry Potter video games. Much of the music would later be re-released on the EA Music Composer Series label in the form of &quot;EA Music Composer Series Volumes 1 and 2&quot;, currently available on digital music outlets.

The operatic score of 1999&#x27;s FA Premier League Manager featured performances by soprano Miranda Keys, who would record again with Hannigan many years later for 2022&#x27;s &quot;Steelrising&quot;, which also featured performances from the Budapest Film Orchestra.

== Screen Music Connect and other conferences ==
In 2013, James Hannigan founded popular yearly conference Game Music Connect with friend and industry commentator, John Broomhall. Held each year at London’s Southbank Centre, the event partnered with PRS For Music, Playstation and British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA). Running for three years between 2013 and 2015, events featured numerous panels with leading composers, and keynote speeches from industry executives from Electronic Arts, Sony Interactive Entertainment and others.

In 2018, it was announced that James Hannigan had founded a new London-based conference on film, television, game and virtual reality music, to be known as &#x27;Screen Music Connect&#x27;.

The composer has talked at numerous conferences and events, including NY Comic Con alongside Neil Gaiman, Kat Dennings and James McAvoy, Musicworks and The BAFTA Interactive Festival. In 2012 James Hannigan was made the subject of BAFTA&#x27;s Conversations With Composers, held at the Albert Hall. 

James Hannigan has spoken at the &quot;Royal College of Music,&quot; has joined panels at NY Comic Con and academic conferences including Ludomusicology. 

==Written publications==
In 2004, Hannigan wrote &quot;Changing Our Tune&quot;, a cover article for the UK&#x27;s &quot;Develop&quot; magazine, outlining some of the differences between scoring for games and conventional linear media forms such as film and television. It was the magazine&#x27;s first audio related cover feature.

In 2010, Hannigan was interviewed for Tom Hoover’s book, “Soundtrack Nation: Interviews with Today&#x27;s Top Professionals in Film, Videogame, and Television Scoring”.

In 2015, he wrote a series of articles on video game music for Classic FM.

In 2016, Hannigan wrote a foreword for Tim Summer&#x27;s book, Understanding Video Game Music, published by Cambridge University Press.

The composer started a blog in 2024 and has written on the subject of AI Music and its implications in an article entitled &quot;AI&#x27;s Hollow Harmony&quot;. He has also written on his love of retro technology and the arcades of the 1980s, showcasing his studio arcade. 

==Public performances==

In 2007, a collage of Hannigan&#x27;s music entitled Welcome to Hogwarts was added to Video Games Live debuting in London at the Royal Festival Hall on 22 October 2007, and featuring the Philharmonia orchestra.

James Hannigan&#x27;s music from The Sandman has been used for several installations and launch events, including the Dream Portal at New York Comic Con, 2022.

 Hannigan&#x27;s &#x27;Soviet March&#x27; theme from Command and Conquer: Red Alert 3 was performed at &#x27;A Night in Fantasia&#x27;, by the Eminence Symphony Orchestra at the Sydney Entertainment Centre, Australia on 26 September 2009. The popular track can be heard on YouTube. Other public performances include Video Games Music Live and the Games &amp; Symphonies concert series.

On 28 October 2010, a concert of Hannigan&#x27;s music was held at St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Nottingham, England. As part of the GameCity 2010 Festival, the concert featured The Pinewood Singers and soloists performing the theme of &#x27;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&#x27;, pieces from Command and Conquer: Red Alert 3, Evil Genius and other titles

In May 2018, it was announced that there would be a performance of Hannigan&#x27;s RuneScape music by the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra at RuneFest 2018.

James Hannigan&#x27;s music for RuneScape was performed in 2024 by the Metropole Orkest in the Netherlands as part of the Games in Concert series.

<text>Joseph Aloysius Wambaugh Jr. (January 22, 1937 – February 28, 2025) was an American writer known for his fictional and nonfictional accounts of police work in the United States. Many of his novels are set in Los Angeles and its surroundings and feature Los Angeles police officers as protagonists. He won three Edgar Awards, and was named a Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of America.

==Early life==
The son of a police officer, Wambaugh was born in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on January 22, 1937. His family moved to Fontana, California, when he was a teenager. He graduated from Chaffey High School in Ontario, California. He joined the U.S. Marine Corps at age 17 and married Dee Allsup at 18. Wambaugh was of Irish and German descent.

==Police career==
Wambaugh received an associate of arts degree from Chaffey College and joined the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) in 1960. He served for 14 years, rising from patrolman to detective sergeant. He also attended Cal State Los Angeles, where he earned BA and MA degrees.

==Writing career==
===Themes===
Wambaugh&#x27;s perspective on police work led to his first novel, &quot;The New Centurions&quot;, which was published early in 1971 to critical acclaim and popular success, while Wambaugh was still a detective. He later quipped that suspects would ask for his autograph.

Soon turning to writing full time, Wambaugh was prolific and popular starting in the 1970s. He mixed writing novels (&quot;The Blue Knight&quot;, &quot;The Choirboys&quot;, &quot;The Black Marble&quot;) with nonfiction accounts of crime and detection (true crime): &quot;The Onion Field&quot;. His later books included &quot;The Glitter Dome&quot; (a TV-movie adaptation that starred James Garner and John Lithgow), &quot;The Delta Star,&quot; and &quot;Lines and Shadows.&quot;

In contrast to conventionally heroic fictional policemen, Wambaugh brought a gritty texture to his flawed police characters. Beginning with &quot;The Choirboys&quot;, Wambaugh changed his approach and began to use dark humor and outrageous incidents to emphasize the psychological peril inherent in modern urban police work. Many characters are referenced by often unflattering nicknames rather than given names, while other characters are given whimsical names to paint an immediate word portrait for the reader. Wambaugh became sharply critical of the command structure of the LAPD and individuals within it, and later, of the city government as well. The character Deputy Chief Digby Bates in &quot;The Black Marble&quot;, for example, is likely a thinly veiled lampoon of Chief Daryl Gates.

Beginning with &quot;The Black Marble&quot; in 1977, Wambaugh devoted at least half of a narrative to satirical observations of the mores and extravagances of the Southern California &quot;rich and famous&quot; lifestyle. &quot;The Black Marble&quot; parodied dog shows and the fading lifestyle of &quot;old&quot; Pasadena, but not entirely unsympathetically. &quot;The Glitter Dome&quot; explored the pornographic film industry, &quot;The Delta Star&quot; delved into the politics and intrigue of the Nobel Prize and scientific research, and &quot;The Secrets of Harry Bright&quot; savaged the Palm Springs lifestyle of wealthy people with second homes, inclinations to drugs and drinking, and restricted country clubs. &quot;The Secrets...&quot; was also a rather grim testimony to how fathers coped with the loss of a child. With &quot;The Golden Orange&quot;, set in Orange County; &quot;Finnegan&#x27;s Week&quot;, set in San Diego; and &quot;Floaters&quot;, set in San Diego within the events of the America&#x27;s Cup yacht racing, Wambaugh broadened the scope of his observations. He was a sharp observer of locations where he lived as a current celebrity himself.

In 1992, Wambaugh generated controversy with his nonfiction book &quot;Echoes in the Darkness&quot;, based on the murder of Susan Reinert, a teacher in the Upper Merion School District in suburban Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Critics alleged that the author paid prosecutors in the trial of principal Jay C. Smith to funnel information to him before an arrest was made. Smith&#x27;s conviction was overturned by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court on the grounds that the prosecution hid the existence of sand that could have supported Smith&#x27;s case. The chief investigator, John J. Holtz of the Pennsylvania State Police, later admitted having accepted $50,000 from author Wambaugh. Smith sued the police for collusion to falsely convict him, but lost after a federal appeals court concluded that despite his release, evidence of his guilt remained overwhelming. The earlier murder conviction of Smith&#x27;s alleged co-conspirator, William Bradfield, remained undisturbed. Bradfield died in prison.

One of Wambaugh&#x27;s most known nonfiction books is &quot;The Blooding&quot;, which tells the story behind an early landmark case in which DNA fingerprinting helped solve two murders in Leicester, England. The DNA evidence resulted in the arrest and conviction of Colin Pitchfork.

In 2003, &quot;Fire Lover: A True Story&quot; brought Wambaugh his second Edgar Award, for Best Crime Fact book. In 2004, he received an MWA Grand Master Award.

In the 2000s, Wambaugh also began teaching screenwriting courses as a guest lecturer for the theater department at the University of California, San Diego.

===&quot;Hollywood Station&quot; series===
In 2006, Wambaugh returned to fiction with the publication of &quot;Hollywood Station&quot;, set in the summer of 2006. It was his first novel since &quot;Floaters&quot; (1996) – and his first to depict the officers and detectives of LAPD since &quot;The Delta Star&quot; (1983). &quot;Hollywood Station&quot; was highly critical of conditions caused by the federal consent decree under which the LAPD had to operate after the Rampart scandal. In 2008, he followed it with &quot;Hollywood Crows&quot;, a sequel featuring Hollywood Division Community Relations Officers (&quot;Crows&quot;) that featured many of the same characters. This was followed by &quot;Hollywood Moon&quot; in 2009, &quot;Hollywood Hills&quot; in 2010, and &quot;Harbor Nocturne&quot; in 2012, set in successive calendar years and involving officers of Hollywood Station&#x27;s midwatch (5:00 pm to 3:00 am). He retired from writing afterward, saying in 2020 he was &quot;too old&quot; to author another book.

The only recurring characters to appear in all five books of the series are &quot;Hollywood Nate&quot; Weiss, a cop with dreams of movie stardom; &quot;Flotsam&quot; and &quot;Jetsam&quot;, two cops who are avid surfers and always speak in a thick surfer lingo; and &quot;Compassionate Charlie&quot; Gilford, a lazy night-watch detective who functions as a sardonic Greek chorus.

The incidents in which the various police characters are involved are based in part on anecdotes Wambaugh collects from working police officers.

===Film and television adaptations===
Many of his books were made into feature films or TV movies during the 1970s and 1980s. &quot;The New Centurions&quot; was a theatrical film starring George C. Scott released in 1972. &quot;The Blue Knight,&quot; a novel following the approaching retirement and last working days of aging veteran beat cop &quot;Bumper&quot; Morgan, was made into an Emmy-winning 1973 TV miniseries starring William Holden. It was also adapted as a short-lived TV series starring George Kennedy. Wambaugh made a brief appearance in the pilot as a desk sergeant. Wambaugh&#x27;s realistic approach to police drama was highly influential in both film and television depictions (such as &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;) from the mid-1970s onward.

Wambaugh was also involved with creating/developing the NBC series &quot;Police Story&quot;, which ran from 1973 to 1978. The anthology show covered the different aspects of police work (patrol, detective, undercover, etc.) in the LAPD, with story ideas and characters supposedly inspired by off-the-record talks with actual police officers. At times, the show&#x27;s characters also dealt with problems not usually seen or associated with typical TV cop shows, such as alcohol abuse, adultery, and brutality. Wambaugh appeared in his second brief acting role in the second-season episode &quot;Incident in the Kill Zone&quot;. The show had a brief revival on ABC during the 1988–1989 season.

Wambaugh wrote the screenplay for the film versions of &quot;The Onion Field&quot; (1979) and &quot;The Black Marble&quot; (1980), both directed by Harold Becker. In 1981, he won an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for his screenplay for the latter film. &quot;The Choirboys&quot; film adaptation had met with poor critical and audience reception a few years earlier. All three films featured performances by then up-and-coming actor James Woods.

&quot;The Glitter Dome&quot;, which starred James Garner, John Lithgow, and Margot Kidder, was a 1984 film for HBO.

&quot;Fugitive Nights&quot; was made into a 1993 feature film of the same title.

==Personal life and death==
Wambaugh and his wife, Dee, had three children, one of whom died in a car crash in 1984. 

Wambaugh died from esophageal cancer at his home in Rancho Mirage, California, on February 28, 2025, at the age of 88.

<text>In Italian folklore and folk customs, the Befana () is a witch-like old woman who delivers gifts to children throughout Italy on Epiphany Eve (the night of January 5) in a similar way to Santa Claus or the Three Magi. The Befana is a widespread tradition among Italians and thus has many names. She is a part of both popular national culture and traditional folk culture and is akin to other figures who roam about sometime during the Twelve Days and reward the good, punish the bad, and receive offerings. The Befana is a mysterious, contradictory figure of unclear origins. This character is enhanced by the fact that she is overall neglected by scholars but is the subject of much speculation by the ones who do mention her. Pre-Christian, Christian, and syncretism of the two have all been postulated as explanations of her origins. In some parts of Italy, especially the central regions, mumming takes place on Epiphany eve. Dolls are made of her and effigies are burnt and bonfires are often lit. She brings gifts to good children, typically sweets, candies or toys, but coal to bad children. She is usually portrayed as a hag riding a broomstick through the air wearing a black shawl and is covered in soot because she enters the children&#x27;s houses through the chimney. She is often smiling and carries a bag or hamper filled with candy, gifts, or both. She is not only loved but also feared and mocked, particularly by children.

==Names and etymology==
A popular belief is that her name derives from the Feast of Epiphany (). Many people believe that the name &quot;Befana&quot; is derived from the Italian version of the Greek word &quot;epifania&quot; or &quot;epiphaneia&quot; (Greek, επιφάνεια = appearance, surface; English: epiphany) and this is the most popular theory. Others posit, however, that the name is a derivative of &quot;bastrina&quot;, the gifts associated with the goddess Strina. In the book &quot;Domestic Life in Palestine&quot;, by Mary E. Rogers (Poe &amp; Hitchcock, 1865) the author notes:

The Befana is known by several other names throughout Italy as demonstrated by , some of them dialectal variants of the Standard Italian &quot;old woman&quot; (vecchia) or &quot;witch&quot; (strega):
Italian folklorist Giuseppe Pitrè also calls her Carcavecchia and the old woman of Christmas, the latter of which is Sicilian. The associated mumming custom also goes by different names in different regions of Italy. In Tuscany it is called the Befanata. It is called the Pasquella in Umbria, Lazio, Marche, Emilia-Romagna, and Abruzzo. It is also known as the Pasquarella in Abruzzo. Both of these latter names are derived from the Italian word for Easter &quot;Pasqua&quot; borrowed straight from the Hebrew &quot;Pesach&quot;.

==Origin==
Written records of the Befana and Befanata date to the Middle Ages. Her origins are the subject of speculation by scholars who have variously proposed they lie in paganism, Christianity, or a mix of the two. John B. Smith said she, like her High German counterpart Perchta, is nothing more than the personification of Epiphany invented by medieval Christians who had a tendency to personify feast and fast days while Jacob Grimm found it not credible that two separate cultures would personify a feast day as a supernatural figure (&quot;a name in the calendar had caused the invention of a supernatural being&quot;) and concluded it was far more likely that the Befana and Perchta were pre-Christian in origin and that they blended with the Christian holiday name. It has been pointed out that there was &quot;a clear attempt to Christianize the disturbing female character by transforming her into the female personification of the feast.&quot; Generally the pre-Christian origin is the one most proposed and the Befana is often said to be a goddess or the remnant of one, though what culture and time period she comes from has been less uniform. Cultures that have been proposed include Roman, Celtic, Neolithic farmers, and Paleolithic hunter-gatherers.

==Appearance and behavior==
In traditional Italian iconography, she is portrayed as having ember eyes, sharp feline teeth, a sharp and cutting tongue, and a sooty face from the chimneys she enters houses through. She is also described as an &quot;ugly, toothless old woman&quot;. Grimm described her as a misshapen fairy. She is said to wear rags, a headscarf, and carries a broom and a sack or a basket that she keeps her gifts in.

Once a year on the night of January 5, she leaves the mountain caves where she is said to live and flies through the air, riding her broom backwards, to bring toys or candy to good children and coal or cinders to naughty children in all of Italy. In many poorer parts of Italy and in particular rural Sicily, a stick in a stocking was placed instead of coal. Being a good housekeeper, many say she will sweep the floor before she leaves. To some the sweeping means the sweeping away of the problems of the year.

Children must not watch her as she visits and delivers items or they are in serious danger as she does not like to be watched. Another, sanitized version says that if the Befana catches someone watching her, they will receive a playful thump on the shoulder from her broomstick. This aspect of the tradition may be designed to keep children in their beds. In Rome, her house is said to be among the roofs of the Piazza Navona. Grimm said she was a &quot;terror to children&quot;. Siporin noted her contradictory character and summed it up thus: &quot;She is grandmotherly but witchlike, the target of endless mockery but deeply beloved, ridiculous and dignified, domestic yet a wanderer, weak and dependent yet feared and powerful. She is an old woman played by a young man.&quot;

==Christian legend==
Christian legend had it that the Befana was approached by the Biblical Magi, also known as the Three Wise Men or the Three Kings, a few days before the birth of the Baby Jesus. They asked for directions to where the Son of God was, as they had seen his star in the sky, but she did not know. She provided them with shelter for a night as she was considered the best housekeeper in the village with the most pleasant home. The Magi invited her to join them on the journey to find the Baby Jesus, but she declined, stating she was too busy with her housework. Later, the Befana had a change of heart and tried to search out the Magi and Jesus. That night she was not able to find them, so to this day the Befana is still searching for the Baby Jesus. She leaves all the good children toys and candy (&quot;caramelle&quot;) or fruit while the bad children get coal or dark candy (&quot;carbone&quot;).

Another commonly heard Christian legend of the Befana starts at the time of the birth of the Baby Jesus. In this telling, Befana spent her days cleaning and sweeping. One day the Magi came to her door in search of the Baby Jesus. However, she turned them away because she was too busy cleaning. Feeling guilty, she eventually decides to find Jesus on her own by following a bright light, also known as the big star in the sky which she believes points the way. She brings along a bag filled with baked goods and gifts for Jesus and a broom to help the new mother clean. Unfortunately despite her best efforts she never finds him. According to this telling, the Befana is still searching after all these centuries for the newborn Messiah. On the eve of the Epiphany, the Befana comes to every house where there is a child and leaves a gift. Although she has been unsuccessful in her search, she still leaves gifts for children everywhere because the Christ Child can be found in all children.

==Associated figures==
In folk tradition, various figures are related to her, comprising a family, and are present in the &quot;befanotti&quot;, though the exact characters involved vary in time and place. Always present is her husband and male counterpart, the Befano, though in some places Saint Anthony the Abbot is said to be her husband. Songs sung as part of the mumming by &quot;befanotti&quot; mention her children, who she is searching for food for either implicitly or explicitly, paralleled in real life by the &quot;befanotti&quot; doing the same. One song specifies their number at one hundred. Grimm noted that &quot;some say, she is Herod’s daughter&quot;. In Latera, the Befana and Befano are accompanied by the Count of Buon’Umor, a crier-type character who announces their presence and asks people to host them and to treat them with love as they ask for it.

==Traditional customs==
A number of customs are associated with her are practiced on the evening of January 5 and the following day, Epiphany (January 6). On the former, groups of men in the Italian countryside travel from house to house collecting food, both for themselves and the Befana in exchange for performing a song, &quot;The Befana&quot; (&quot;La Befana&quot;), and sometimes skits and other entertainment like dancing and quips for the houses’ inhabitants. The men who participate in these activities are called &quot;befanotti&quot;. While scholars have traditionally called this a &quot;begging custom&quot;, Steve Siporin disagrees and argues it is an equal exchange (food for entertainment) designed to preserve the dignity of the &quot;befanotti&quot; precisely so they are not reduced to begging. The &quot;befanotti&quot; themselves view it as an exchange and one song explicitly states &quot;the Befana doesn’t beg&quot;. The songs often, implicitly or explicitly, encourage the people being visited to give generously, typically because if they do not something bad will happen, either to the household (including people, animals, and objects, such as the house itself) or to the Befana, who is effectively held hostage. Alternatively, these threats were not to be taken seriously, akin to teasing and pranks that are part of the fun and festivities of the Befanata rather than actual intimidation. Fitting this atmosphere, the skits performed by the &quot;befanotti&quot; are suggestive and carnivalesque and Epiphany is the start of the Carnival season. Sometimes the song requests specific foods from the households, of which meat, especially pork, and eggs are paramount. In Tuscany, the song is the main performance and is always present. Italian folklorists have collected a large number of Befana songs from all over the country which demonstrate great lyrical variety and are very local, though mention of local landmarks is rare. There may be versions of songs sung only to specific people, such as those who are stingy to convince them to be more generous. Traditionally, the men who comprised the &quot;befanotti&quot; were the poorest in the village and rich men were severely prohibited from forming their own squads and taking part. This is because the practical function of the &quot;befanotti&quot; was to provide those who had little to no food with fat and protein rich foods over the winter to, at least temporarily, ward off hunger and death via starvation, which was ever present in Italy until only the 20th century, in some areas even into the latter half of said century. Neither this restriction nor the sense that this custom is only for the poor exists nowadays. However the custom does not exist in all parts of the country. It is absent from Sicily where in the past wealthy landowners directly distributed food to the poor in a way that &quot;was humiliating to the recipients&quot;, thus negating the need for the Befanata and other, similar begging or exchange rituals.

In the 20th century, Pitrè noted a custom in which &quot;We carry around the old witch . . . and we chase her&quot;. Dolls and effigies of the Befana are commonly made. The former are black and are considered lucky, possibly as a result of their black color. They are ugly in appearance and &quot;made of rags&quot;. On Twelfth Night in Rome, these dolls are placed in windows by women and children and on Epiphany, &quot;in some Tuscan villages a large effigy of her [the Befana] was burnt.&quot; Bonfires are often lit as well. On Epiphany eve, families with children typically leave out a small glass of wine and a plate with a few morsels of food, often regional or local, for the Befana.

==Ban==
In 1977, the Italian government, headed at that time by Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, canceled Epiphany as a national public holiday, along with several other feasts in the schedule, in an attempt to perk up the country’s sagging economy. Until recently, Epiphany had been &quot;more lavishly celebrated than Christmas&quot; and was also known by Italians as &quot;Little Christmas&quot;. &quot;Poor Befana, she is a refugee,&quot; Pope Paul VI lamented in a public speech, &quot;She seeks shelter now on the first Sunday after the feast which was her own.&quot;
The public holiday was reinstated in 1985. 

==Parallels==
She has long been noted to resemble other Christmas gift-bringers and figures who roam during the Christmas season and is called the Italian version of them, though different parts of Italy have other gift-bringers as well, such as the Three Kings. In particular, her resemblance to the female German figures of Holle and Perchta is often noted by scholars, even if just in passing, and the Befana is considered their Italian equivalent. The Befana and Perchta &quot;both bring well-being&quot;. There is an evil Befana who punishes girls and women who spin on Epiphany eve, which is prohibited in some places. Perchta does the same though the prohibited day(s) vary by location. There are also analogs in Greek, Anatolian, and Slavic mythology and traditions. Pitrè thought the modern Italian custom of carrying and driving the Befana out bears similarity to the ancient Roman custom of leading and driving out a figure called Mamurius Venturius, Old Winter Man, who was clad in animal skins. Historian Carlo Ginzburg relates her to Nicnevin. The old lady character should then represent the &quot;old year&quot; just passed, ready to be burned in order to give place to the new one. In many European countries, the tradition still exists of burning a puppet of an old lady at the beginning of the New Year. In northern Italy, this figure is called Giubiana.

==Interpretations and theories==
The mystery of the Befana has led to many interpretations and theories over the centuries. The tradition of Befana appears to incorporate several pre-Christian popular elements, adapted to Christian culture and related to the celebration of the New Year. Jacob Grimm simply called her a &quot;misshapen fairy&quot; despite drawing parallels between her and Perchta, the latter of whom he considered to be a former heathen goddess. James Frazer simply said she was &quot;an old hag.&quot; Steve Siporin thinks &quot;they both missed the mark.&quot; After noting that effigies of her are burnt, Marinoni remarks &quot;Of how many things does indeed the dawn of a new year mark the death!&quot; John Forsdyke says she has &quot;become the representative of the evil influences that are destroyed on Twelfth Night.&quot; Cattabiani reports that she has been interpreted as &quot;an image of Mother Nature&quot; and the old dying year who sows the seeds, even if just symbolically, for her reappearance &quot;in the guise of young Nature&quot;, alluding to a goddess with power over plants, animals, abundance, prosperity, life, and death. Italian anthropologists Claudia and Luigi Manciocco, in their book &quot;Una casa senza porte&quot; (&quot;A House without Doors&quot;) trace the Befana&#x27;s origins back to Neolithic beliefs and practices. The team of anthropologists also wrote about the Befana as a figure that evolved into a goddess associated with fertility and agriculture. The Befana may be connected to a prehistoric European bear cult that was practiced among hunter-gatherers and which dates as far back as the Upper Paleolithic.

A theory connects the tradition of exchanging gifts to an ancient Roman festivity in honor of Janus and Strenia (in Italian a Christmas gift used to be called &quot;strenna&quot;), celebrated at the beginning of the year when Romans used to give each other presents. In the book &quot;Vestiges of Ancient Manners and Customs, Discoverable in Modern Italy and Sicily&quot; (1823), John J. Blunt says:

==Contemporary customs==
The Befana is celebrated throughout all of Italy, and has become a national icon. In the regions of Marche, Umbria, and Lazio, her figure is associated with the Papal States where the Epiphany held the most importance. Urbania is thought to be her official home. Every year there is a big festival held to celebrate the holiday. About 30,000 to 50,000 people attend the festivities. Hundreds of Befanas are present, swinging from the main tower. They juggle, dance, and greet all the children.

Traditionally, all Italian children may expect to find a lump of &quot;coal&quot; in their stockings (actually rock candy made black with food coloring) as every child has been at least occasionally bad during the year.

Three places in Italy are nowadays associated with the Befana tradition:

* Piazza Navona, in central Rome, is the site of a popular market each year between Christmas and the Epiphany, where toys, coal candy, and other candies are on sale. The feast of the Befana in Rome was immortalized in four famous sonnets in the Romanesco dialect by the 19th century Roman poet Giuseppe Gioachino Belli. In Ottorino Respighi&#x27;s 1928 &quot;Feste Romane&quot; (English: &quot;Roman Festivals&quot;), the fourth movement, titled &quot;La Befana&quot;, is an orchestral portrayal of this Piazza Navona festival. A common superstition is that at midnight when it turns January 6 the Befana shows herself in a window of Piazza Navona and visitors often go there to observe this.
* The town of Urbania in the province of Pesaro and Urbino in Marche where the national Befana festival is held each year, usually between January 2 and 6. A &quot;house of the Befana&quot; is scheduled to be built and the post office has a mailbox reserved for letters addressed to the Befana, mirroring what happens with Santa Claus in Rovaniemi.
* In Fornovo di Taro, a town in the province of Parma, the national meeting &quot;Raduno Nazionale delle Befane e dei Befani&quot; is held on 5 and 6 January.

In other parts of the world where a vibrant Italian community exists, traditions involving Befana may be observed and shared or celebrated with the wider community. In Toronto, Canada for example, a Befana Choir shows up on the winter solstice each December to sing in the Kensington Market Festival of Lights parade. Women, men, and children dressed in Befana costumes and nose sing love songs to serenade the sun to beckon its return. The singing hags gather in the street to give candy to children, to cackle and screech to accordion music, and to sing in every key imaginable as delighted parade participants join in the cacophony. Sometimes, the Befanas dance with paradegoers and dust down the willing as they walk by.

==Poems and songs==
There are poems about Befana, which are known in slightly different versions throughout Italy. Here is one of the versions:
&quot;La Befana vien di notte&quot;
&quot;Con le scarpe tutte rotte&quot;
&quot;Col vestito alla romana&quot;
&quot;Viva, Viva La Befana!&quot;
The English translation is:
&quot;The Befana comes by night&quot;
&quot;With her shoes all tattered and torn&quot;
&quot;She comes dressed in the Roman way&quot;
&quot;Long live the Befana!&quot;
Another version is given in a poem by Giovanni Pascoli:
&quot;Viene, viene la Befana&quot;
&quot;Vien dai monti a notte fonda&quot;
&quot;Come è stanca! la circonda &quot;
&quot;Neve e gelo e tramontana!&quot;
&quot;Viene, viene la Befana&quot;
The English translation is:
&quot;Here comes, here comes the Befana&quot;
&quot;She comes from the mountains in the deep of the night&quot;
&quot;Look how tired she is! All wrapped up&quot;
&quot;In snow and frost and the north wind!&quot; 
&quot;Here comes, here comes the Befana!&quot;
==In modern media==
*&quot;How the Toys Saved Christmas&quot;, 1996 animated film.
*&quot;&quot; features a villainous version of the character in the season 2 episode &quot;Befana&quot;.
*The Italian-language Christmas fantasy comedy film &quot;The Legend of the Christmas Witch&quot; () was released on December 27, 2018. The Italian-Spanish co-production was directed by Michele Soavi and features a 500-year-old Befana who works as a schoolteacher by day.
*The 2022 Disney+ Christmas miniseries &quot;The Santa Clauses&quot; featured Befana played by Laura San Giacomo.

<text>The Spithead and Nore mutinies were two major mutinies by sailors of the Royal Navy in 1797. They were the first in an increasing series of outbreaks of maritime radicalism in the Atlantic World. Despite their temporal proximity, the mutinies differed in character. The Spithead mutiny was a simple, peaceful, successful strike action to address economic grievances, while the Nore mutiny was a more radical action, articulating political ideals as well, which failed.

The mutinies were extremely concerning for Britain, because at the time the country was at war with Revolutionary France, and the Navy was the main component of the war effort. There were also concerns among the government that the mutinies might be part of wider attempts at revolutionary sedition instigated by societies such as the London Corresponding Society and the United Irishmen.

==Spithead==

The mutiny at Spithead (an anchorage near Portsmouth) lasted from 16 April to 15 May 1797. Sailors on 16 ships in the Channel Fleet, commanded by Admiral Lord Bridport, protested against the living conditions aboard Royal Navy vessels and demanded a pay rise, better victualling, increased shore leave, and compensation for sickness and injury. On 26 April a supportive mutiny broke out on 15 ships in Plymouth, who sent delegates to Spithead to take part in negotiations.

Seamen&#x27;s pay rates had been established in 1658, and because of the stability of wages and prices, they were still reasonable as late as the 1756–1763 Seven Years&#x27; War; however, high inflation during the last decades of the 18th century had severely eroded the real value of the pay. Pay raises had meanwhile been granted to the army, militia, and naval officers. At the same time, the practice of coppering the submerged part of hulls, which had started in 1761, meant that British warships no longer had to return to port frequently to have their hulls scraped, and the additional time at sea greatly altered the rhythm and difficulty of seamen&#x27;s work. The Royal Navy had not made adjustments for any of these changes, and was slow to understand their effects on its crews. Impressment (a common practice) meant that some of the seamen were onboard ship against their will. Finally, the new wartime quota system meant that crews had many landsmen from inshore (including some convicted criminals sent in lieu of punishment) who did not mix well with the career seamen, leading to discontented ships&#x27; companies.

The mutineers were led by elected delegates and tried to negotiate with the Admiralty for two weeks, focusing their demands on better pay, the abolition of the 14-ounce &quot;purser&#x27;s pound&quot; (the ship&#x27;s purser was allowed to keep two ounces of every true pound—16 ounces—of meat as a , equivalent to in every ), and the removal of a handful of unpopular officers. Neither flogging nor impressment was mentioned in the mutineers&#x27; demands, even though ending impressment had been one of the motivations for the Mutiny. The mutineers maintained regular naval routine and discipline aboard their ships (mostly with their regular officers), allowed some ships to leave for convoy escort duty or patrols, and promised to suspend the mutiny and go to sea immediately if French ships were spotted heading for English shores.

Because of mistrust, especially over pardons for the mutineers, the negotiations broke down, and minor incidents broke out, with several unpopular officers sent to shore and others treated with signs of deliberate disrespect. When the situation calmed, Admiral Lord Howe intervened to negotiate an agreement that issued a royal pardon for all crews, reassignment of some of the unpopular officers, and a pay raise and abolition of the purser&#x27;s pound. Afterwards, the mutiny was to become nicknamed the &quot;breeze at Spithead&quot;.

==The Nore==

Inspired by the example of their comrades at Spithead, the sailors at the Nore, an anchorage in the Thames Estuary, also mutinied, on 12 May 1797, when the crew of seized control of the ship. Several other ships in the same location followed this example, though others slipped away during the mutiny despite gunfire from the ships that were attempting to use force to hold the mutiny together. The mutineers had been unable to organise easily because the ships were scattered along the Nore (and were not all part of a unified fleet, as at Spithead), but they quickly elected delegates for each ship.

Richard Parker was elected &quot;President of the Delegates of the Fleet&quot;. According to him, he was nominated and elected without his knowledge. Parker was a former master&#x27;s mate who was disrated and court-martialled in December 1793 and re-enlisted in the Navy as a seaman in early 1797, where he came to serve aboard the brig-sloop . A list of eight demands was formulated on 20 May 1797, and presented to Admiral Charles Buckner. The demands mainly involved pardons, increased pay, and modification of the Articles of War, eventually expanding to a demand that the King dissolve Parliament and make immediate peace with France. These demands infuriated the Admiralty, which offered nothing except a pardon (plus the concessions already made at Spithead) in exchange for an immediate return to duty.

Captain Sir Erasmus Gower commissioned HMS &quot;Neptune&quot; (98 guns) in the upper Thames and put together a flotilla of fifty loyal ships to prevent the mutineers moving on the city of London. It was largely fear of this blockade moving down river that made the mutineers reconsider their actions and begin to waver.

The mutineers expanded their initial grievances and blockaded London, preventing merchant vessels from entering the port, and the principals made plans to sail their ships to France, alienating the regular English sailors and losing more and more ships as the mutiny progressed. This gave rise to a fear in the Admiralty that ships still at sea might be taken to France, but that was generally unfounded. When word of the mutiny reached the squadron under Sir John Borlase Warren, cruising off Ushant, the crew of HMS &quot;Galatea&quot; seized her, confining her captain, Richard Goodwin Keats, but the whole squadron nonetheless followed orders to return to Plymouth. There was seemingly no thought of treason – the men just wanted improvements in their conditions. When they returned to shore Keats was released and once prize money was secured and other matters of pay were settled, they returned to their station. Although the port of Brest was unwatched for some weeks the French missed the opportunity to get to sea.

On 5 June, Parker issued an order that merchant ships be allowed to pass the blockade, and only Royal Navy victualling (i.e., supply) ships be detained. The ostensible reason provided in the order was that &quot;the release of the merchant vessels would create a favourable impression on shore&quot;, although this decision may have had more to do with such a wide and complex undertaking as interdicting all the merchant traffic on the busy Thames. After the successful resolution of the Spithead mutiny, the government and the Admiralty were not inclined to make further concessions, particularly as they felt some leaders of the Nore mutiny had political aims beyond improving pay and living conditions.

The mutineers were denied food and water, and when Parker hoisted the signal for the ships to sail to France, all of the remaining ships refused to follow.

Meanwhile, Captain Charles Cunningham of , which was there for a refit, persuaded his crew to return to duty and slipped off to Sheerness. This was seen as a signal to others to do likewise, and eventually, most ships slipped their anchors and deserted (some under fire from the mutineers), and the mutiny failed. Parker was quickly convicted of treason and piracy and hanged from the yardarm of &quot;Sandwich&quot;, the vessel where the mutiny had started. In the reprisals that followed, 29 were hanged, 29 were imprisoned, and nine were flogged, while others were sentenced to transportation to Australia. One such was surgeon&#x27;s mate William Redfern who became a respected surgeon and landowner in New South Wales. The majority of men involved in the mutiny were not punished at all, which was lenient by the standards of the time.

After the Nore mutiny, Royal Navy vessels no longer rang five bells in the last dog watch, as that had been the signal to begin the mutiny.
==Alleged role of the United Irishmen==
The authorities were more than ready to see in the mutinies, not only the hand of English radicals but also among the large contingent of Irish sailors, the hand of the United Irishmen. Much was made of Valentine Joyce, among the delegates at Spithead, described by Edmund Burke as a &quot;seditious Belfast clubist&quot;.

That the Valentine Joyce in question was Irish and a republican has been disputed, and while that &quot;rebellious paper, the &quot;Northern Star&quot;&quot; (from Belfast) may have circulated as reported among the mutineers, no evidence has emerged of a concerted United Irish plot to subvert the fleet. In Ireland there was talk of seizing British warships as part of a general insurrection, but it was only after the Spithead and Nore mutinies that United Irishmen awoke to &quot;surprising effectiveness&quot; of formulating sedition within the Royal Navy&quot;.

, which had been part of the &quot;floating republic&quot; at Spithead, did see United Irish oaths administered (according to court-martial evidence) in a further mutinous conspiracy during the Irish rebellion in the early summer of 1798. Eleven of the crew were hanged and ten sentenced to transportation.

==Mutinies and discontent following==
In September 1797, the crew of mutinied in the West Indies, killing almost all the officers in revenge for a number of grievances, including throwing into the sea, without proper burial, the bodies of three men killed by falling from the rigging in a desperate attempt not to be the last men on deck, which was punishable by flogging. The &quot;Hermione&quot; was taken by the crew to the Spanish port of La Guaira.

On 27 December, the crew of murdered their officers and took their ship into a French port in the West Indies. Other mutinies took place off the coast of Ireland and at the Cape of Good Hope and spread to the fleet under Admiral Jervis off the coast of Spain. As noted above, in July 1798 a court martial on board took the evidence of the oaths of allegiance to the United Irishmen as a prelude to mutiny, and eleven men were sentenced to hang for it. 

In the years following Spithead and the Nore, there was about a 50% increase in mutinies among European navies and merchant companies. Scholars have linked it to the radical political ideologies developing at the time, including the development of working class consciousness among sailors. Both explanations have been the subject of extensive academic investigation. Political analyses often emphasize the radical discourse and conduct of the Nore mutineers as evidence of their ideological motivation. Class analyses often emphasize harsh discipline and economic grievances of the Spithead mutineers as pointing to &quot;class solidarity&quot;. Recent attempts have been made to class these approaches under a heading of masculine identity, arguing that interpretations of what it meant to be a man for sailors marked the difference of motivation between the two mutinies.

<text>The Child Support Agency (CSA) was a delivery arm of the Department for Work and Pensions (Child Maintenance Group) in Great Britain and the former Department for Social Development in Northern Ireland. Launched on 5 April 1993, the CSA was to implement the Child Support Act 1991 and arrange payments for parents living with their children. The CSA was abolished and replaced in 2012 by its successor, the Child Maintenance Service (CMS).

==Functions and involvement==
The CSA&#x27;s function was twofold, encompassing calculation of how much child maintenance is due (based on current legislation and rules) and collection, enforcement and transferral of the payment from the non-resident parent to the person with care.

For the CSA to generate a mediation of payment case, their services had to be requested by one of the parents; or to generate a recovery case, the parent with care (PWC) had to be in receipt of Income support, Jobseekers Allowance, Sickness Benefit, or another such benefit. Legislation also allowed children in Scotland to initiate a case against one or both non-resident parents (NPCs).

The CSA could not get involved, even upon request, in the following circumstances (except in cases where the parent with care claims Income Support or Jobseekers Allowance):
* if the non-resident parent lives abroad;
* if a written agreement made prior to 5 April 1993, is in place;
* if a court order regarding maintenance was made before 3 March 2003.

==Calculation and systems==
A new method of child maintenance calculation came into effect on 3 March 2003. The previous method used a &quot;complex formula of up to 108 pieces of information&quot;, by first calculating the total child maintenance required based on the children&#x27;s ages, then calculating the non-resident parents income after various allowances were subtracted, and finally working out what portion of the calculated maintenance was to be paid by the non-resident parent, based on their income.

Under the new method the formula for child maintenance was simplified, with a fixed percentage basic rate being calculated using the NRPs net income (of £200 to £2,000 per week), and deductions of 15% for one child, 20% for two, and 25% for three or more. Where maintenance is calculated using the basic rate, the amount of maintenance is also reduced if the non-resident parent has children in their current family. Where this is relevant, the CSA would not take into account: 15% of their net weekly income if there is one child living with them, 20% if they are two children living with them, and 25% for three or more.

==Criticism==
The Independent Case Examiner (ICE) was set up in 1997 as an independent body to deal with complaints about the CSA. Three recurring themes are mentioned in multiple previous annual reports, namely delay (51% of complaints in 2004-2005), error (24% of complaints in 2004-2005) and no action taken (14% of complaints in 2004-2005). According to Department for Work and Pensions statistics, the average length of time for a case to be cleared under the new scheme has increased from an average of 18 days in March 2003, to 287 in December 2005.

Updated statistics published in the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission Annual Report and Accounts 2010/11 showed that, whilst payments were being made in 65% of CSA cases for the year April 2006 – March 2007, this had increased to 78% by March 2011.

Assessments based on the same financial criteria can give different results, depending on which rules the case is judged under. Non-resident parents who would pay less under the new rules could not get reassessed, except in special circumstances. While the CSA planned to move everyone to the same system in due course, in the interim different people with identical situations would pay different amounts, based solely on when the case was first assessed. One father, whose monthly payments would have dropped from £250 to £150 under the new rules, decided to take the CSA to the European Court of Human Rights, claiming that this discrepancy amounted to discrimination under article 14 of the convention. However, official statistics showed that the average weekly liability was slightly more under the new scheme. For the years 2006—2007, the average new scheme liability was constantly £23 per week, whereas the old scheme varied from £22 to £23.

In November 2004, the head of the CSA resigned amid widespread criticism of the CSA systems. Sir Archy Kirkwood, chairman of Work and Pensions Committee, described the situation as &quot;a systemic, chronic failure of management right across the totality of the agency.&quot; In November 2005, Prime Minister Tony Blair, admitted that the CSA is &quot;not properly suited&quot; to its job, amid reports that for every £1.85 that gets through to children, the CSA spend £1 on administration.

Even prior to its opening, the CSA was subject to criticism, with MP David Tredinnick describing the CSA as a &quot;sequel to 1984&quot; due to concerns about &quot;CSA Snooping&quot;. In February 2006, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions John Hutton asked Sir David Henshaw to redesign the child support system with three key areas of focus; how best to ensure parents take financial responsibility for their children when they are apart, the best arrangements for delivering this outcome cost effectively and the options for moving to new structures and policies, recognising the need to protect the level of service offered to the current 1.5 million parents with care.

On 24 July 2006, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, John Hutton MP, announced that the CSA was not working and as a result would be axed and replaced by a &quot;smaller, more focused&quot; body.

In March 2008 a website, CSAhell.com, allowed people to publicly post their stories and receive feedback. The website was quoted in the national press on CSA-related stories. Since its creation, the website has published almost 2,500 stories and complaints about the CSA, and has itself been criticised by the Public and Commercial Services Union.

==Outstanding debt==
CSA arrears accumulated since 1993 totals just under £3.8bn. This total remained largely unchanged between 2008 and 2011.

==Replacement==
In December 2006, the Department for Work and Pensions published its Child Support white paper outlining its plans for the future of Child Support.

On 1 November 2008, the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission took management responsibility for the CSA.
In October 2011, the Department for Work and Pensions launched a public consultation on plans to abolish CMEC and transfer its functions back to the Department. This was approved after consultation and agreement by both Houses of Parliament. Responsibility for staff and functions passed from CMEC back to the Department for Work and Pensions on 30 July 2012, becoming the &#x27;Child Maintenance Group&#x27;.

From 10 December 2012, a new system of child maintenance began operation, initially for specific applicants. It is known as the &#x27;Child Maintenance Service&#x27;, and operates within the legislation provided under the Welfare Reform Act 2012. Existing cases continue under previous legislation at present.

From 25 November 2013, all new applications for child maintenance must be made through the &#x27;Child Maintenance Service&#x27; using the new statutory &#x27;2012 Scheme&#x27; and associated legislation. No new applications are accepted by the Child Support Agency, and existing cases are being closed on a planned progression basis, which is intended to finish by 2017/18.

<doc id="666596" wikidata="Q6721790" url="?curid=666596" title="MacCormick v Lord Advocate">
<text>MacCormick v Lord Advocate 1953 SC 396 was a Scottish constitutional law case and Scottish legal action on whether Queen Elizabeth II was entitled to use the numeral &quot;II&quot; as her regnal number in Scotland, as there had never been an earlier Elizabeth reigning in Scotland.

==Facts==
John MacCormick (the Rector of the University of Glasgow) and Ian Hamilton (then part of the Glasgow University Scottish Nationalist Association) contested the right of Queen Elizabeth II to style herself &#x27;Elizabeth II&#x27; within Scotland. They claimed it was a breach of the Act of Union 1707 between England and Scotland, since Elizabeth I had been Queen of England but not of Scotland. The action was brought against the Crown, which was represented by the Lord Advocate, who is the most senior law officer in Scotland.

==Judgment==
The petition first came before Lord Guthrie, sitting as Lord Ordinary in the Outer House (the court of first instance in the Court of Session). He dismissed it; this was appealed to the Inner House. The appeal was heard by the Lord President (Lord Cooper of Culross), Lord Carmont, and Lord Russell. There, MacCormick and Hamilton lost their case: it was held that the treaty had no provision concerning the numbering of monarchs—it was part of the royal prerogative, and that they had no title to sue the Crown. The Lord President did give his opinion that &quot;the principle of unlimited sovereignty of Parliament is a distinctively English principle and has no counterpart in Scottish constitutional law&quot;. The case was thus constitutionally interesting as the Lord Advocate &quot;conceded this point by admitting that the Parliament of the United Kingdom &#x27;could not&#x27; repeal or alter [certain] &#x27;fundamental and essential&#x27; conditions&quot; of the Act of Union. However, the Lord President also held that &quot;there is neither precedent nor authority of any kind for the view that the domestic Courts of either Scotland or England have jurisdiction to determine whether a governmental act of the type here in controversy is or is not conform to the provisions of a Treaty&quot; and &quot;it has not been shown that the Court of Session has authority to entertain the issue sought to be raised&quot;.

==Significance==
The outcome of this case has had continuing relevance, most notably in 1999, when the British Parliament discussed the creation of the Scottish Parliament. It has been discussed in a number of later decisions of the courts, notably &quot;Gibson v Lord Advocate&quot; 1975 SC 136, and the English case of &quot;Jackson v Attorney General&quot;, [2005] 3 WLR 733.

Winston Churchill suggested that British sovereigns would use either the English or the Scottish number, whichever was higher.

<doc id="666600" wikidata="Q451007" url="?curid=666600" title="Andrew Irvine (mountaineer)">
<text>Andrew Comyn &quot;Sandy&quot; Irvine (8 April 1902 – 8 or 9 June 1924) was a British mountaineer who took part in the 1924 British Mount Everest expedition, the third British expedition to the world&#x27;s highest (8,848 m) mountain, Mount Everest. He and his climbing partner George Mallory disappeared somewhere high on the mountain&#x27;s northeast ridge, last seen alive at an indeterminate distance from the summit. Mallory&#x27;s body was found in 1999, and Irvine&#x27;s partial remains were discovered in 2024.

==Early life==
Irvine was born in Birkenhead, Cheshire, one of six children of historian William Fergusson Irvine (1869–1962) and Lilian Davies-Colley (1870–1950). His father&#x27;s family had Scottish and Welsh roots, while his mother was from an old Cheshire family. He was a cousin of journalist and writer Lyn Irvine, and also of pioneering female surgeon Eleanor Davies Colley and of political activist Harriet Shaw Weaver.

He was educated at Birkenhead School and Shrewsbury School, where he demonstrated a natural engineering acumen, able to improvise fixes or improvements to almost anything mechanical. During the First World War, he created a small stir at the War Office by sending them a design for a synchronisation gear to allow a machine gun to fire from a propeller-driven aeroplane through the propeller without damaging its blades, and also a design for a gyroscopic stabiliser for aircraft.

He was also a keen sportsman and particularly excelled at rowing. His prodigious ability as a rower made him a star of the 1919 &#x27;Peace Regatta&#x27; at Henley with the Royal Shrewsbury School Boat Club, and propelled him to Merton College, Oxford, to study engineering. At Oxford, he joined the Oxford University Mountaineering Club, and was also a member of the Oxford crew for the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race in 1922 and a member of the winning crew in 1923, the only time Oxford won between 1913 and 1937.

Irvine had an affair with a former chorus girl named Marjory Agnes Standish Summers (née Thompson). Marjory was married to the steel magnate Henry Hall Summers and was 33 years younger than her husband. Summers was one of the sons of founder John Summers, of John Summers &amp; Sons, a steel company. While Irvine was on Everest, Henry began divorce proceedings against Marjory.

==Everest expedition==

In 1923, Irvine took part in the Merton College Arctic Expedition to Spitsbergen which was led by George Binney, Irvine excelled on every front. Other mountaineers on the expedition were Tom Longstaff and Noel Odell, Irvine discovered that he and Odell had met in 1919 when Irvine had ridden his motorcycle to the top of Foel Grach, a 3,000-foot-high Welsh mountain, and surprised Odell and his wife Mona, who had climbed it on foot. Subsequently, on Odell&#x27;s recommendation, Irvine was invited to join the forthcoming third British Mount Everest expedition on the grounds that he might be the &quot;superman&quot; that the expedition felt it needed. He was at the time still a 21-year-old undergraduate student.

Irvine set sail for the Himalaya from Liverpool on board SS &quot;California&quot; on 29 February 1924, along with three other members of the expedition, including George Mallory. Mallory later wrote home to his wife that Irvine &quot;could be relied on for anything except perhaps conversation&quot;.

During the expedition, he made major and crucial innovations to the expedition&#x27;s professionally designed oxygen sets, radically improving their functionality, lightness, and strength. He also maintained the expedition&#x27;s cameras, camp beds, primus stoves, and many other devices. He was universally popular, and respected by his older colleagues for his ingenuity, companionability, and unstinting hard work.

The expedition made two unsuccessful attempts on the summit in early June, and time remained for one more before the heavy snowfall that came with the summer monsoon would make climbing too dangerous. This last chance fell to the expedition&#x27;s most experienced climber, George Mallory. To the surprise of other expedition members, Mallory chose the 22-year-old inexperienced Irvine above the older, more seasoned climber, Noel Odell. Irvine&#x27;s proficiency with the oxygen equipment was obviously a major factor in Mallory&#x27;s decision, but some debate has occurred ever since about the precise reasons for his choice.

Mallory and Irvine began their ascent on 6 June, and by the end of the next day, the pair had established a final two-man camp at , from which to make their final push on the summit. What time they departed on 8 June is unknown, but circumstantial evidence suggests that they did not have the smooth, early start that Mallory had hoped for.

Odell, who was acting in a supporting role, reported seeing them at 12:50 pm—much later than expected—ascending what he believed was the Second Step of the northeast ridge and &quot;going strongly for the top&quot;, although in the years that followed, exactly which of the Three Steps Odell had sighted the pair climbing became extremely controversial.

==Traces on the ridge==

===Discovery of the ice axe===
In 1933, nine years after the disappearance of Mallory and Irvine, Percy Wyn-Harris, a member of the fourth British Everest Expedition discovered an ice axe around , about below the ridge and some before the First Step. It was found lying loose on brown &#x27;boiler-plate&#x27; slabs of rock, which though not particularly steep, were smooth and in places had a covering of loose pebbles. The Swiss manufacturer&#x27;s name matched those of a number supplied to the 1924 expedition, and since only Mallory and Irvine had climbed that high along the ridge route, it must have belonged to one of them.

Hugh Ruttledge, leader of the 1933 expedition, speculated that the ice axe marked the scene of a fall, during which it was either accidentally dropped or that its owner put it down, possibly to have both hands free to hold the rope.
Noel Odell, the last man to see Mallory and Irvine on their ascent in 1924, offered a more benign explanation: that the ice axe had merely been placed there on the ascent to be collected on the way back since the climbing ahead was almost entirely on rock under the prevailing conditions.

In 1963, a characteristic triple nick mark on a military swagger stick, found among Andrew Irvine&#x27;s possessions, was found to match a similar mark on the ice axe&#x27;s shaft, suggesting the axe belonged to Irvine. In an interview with PBS, Wyn Harris, who discovered the ice axe, claimed, &quot;When I picked up the axe there was no mark on it. The cross, over which there has been so much controversy, was not put on either by Mallory or Irvine. It was in fact cut by my personal Sherpa porter, Kusang Pugla, who did it under threats from me that it must not be lost or mixed up with other axes.&quot;

===Discovery of the oxygen cylinder===
In May 1991, a 1924 oxygen cylinder was found around , some higher and closer to the First Step than the ice axe found in 1933.
Since only Mallory and Irvine had been on the northeast ridge in 1924, this oxygen cylinder marked the minimum altitude they must have reached on their final climb. The oxygen cylinder was recovered in May 1999.

==Discovery of Mallory==
In May 1999, Mallory&#x27;s body was found at by the Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition, in a funnel-shaped basin on the &quot;8,200 m Snow Terrace&quot;, some below and about horizontal to the location of the ice axe found in 1933. The remains of a rope still encircled his waist, which exhibited serious haemorrhaging, indicative of a strong rope-jerk injury, and strongly suggesting that at some point either Mallory or Irvine fell while they were still roped together. Mallory was found with relatively few major injuries, compared to a number of modern climbers who had fallen the full distance from the northeast ridge and who were found to have sustained numerous fractures, suggesting he had survived this initial fall, and suffered a further accident. A golf ball-sized puncture wound in his forehead seemed to be the likely cause of death, and could have been inflicted by an ice axe. It has subsequently been speculated that an injured Mallory was descending in a self-arrest &quot;glissade&quot;, sliding down the slope while dragging his ice axe in the snow to control the speed of his descent, and that his ice axe may have struck a rock and bounced off, striking him fatally.

A search of the body revealed two pieces of circumstantial evidence that suggested that Mallory might have possibly reached the summit:

*Firstly, Mallory&#x27;s daughter had always said that Mallory carried a photograph of his wife on his person with the intention of leaving it on the summit when he reached it, and no such photograph was found on the body. Given the excellent state of preservation of the body and the artifacts recovered from it, the absence of the photograph suggests that he may have reached the summit and deposited it there.
* Secondly, Mallory&#x27;s snow goggles were in his pocket when the body was found, indicating that he died at night, that he and Irvine had made a push for the summit and were descending very late in the day. Given their known departure time and movements, had they not made the summit, it is unlikely that they would have still been out by nightfall.

In addition to the two points, the visual account of Odell&#x27;s sighting of the two climbers above the Second Step and &quot;going strongly for the top&quot; is also a contributing factor, as climbers and historians believe that once past the Second Step, climbers are more likely to summit instead of turning around. Once again, the exact location where Odell saw the climbers is highly debated.
The search revealed no trace of the two Vest Pocket Kodak cameras that Irvine&#x27;s diaries said he and Mallory were carrying, leading to speculation that one or more of the cameras might yet be found with Irvine&#x27;s body. Experts from Kodak have said that there is a good chance that the cameras&#x27; black-and-white film could be developed to produce &quot;printable images&quot;, due to its chemical nature and its likely preservation in subzero temperatures. Such images could illuminate the fate of Mallory and Irvine.

==Possible sightings==

===Sighting by Wang Hong-bao===
In 1979, Ryoten Hasegawa, the leader of the Japanese contingent of a Sino-Japanese reconnaissance expedition to the north side of Everest, had a brief conversation with a Chinese climber named Wang Hong-bao, in which Wang recounted that while on the 1975 Chinese Everest Expedition, he had seen the body of an &quot;English dead&quot; at , lying on his side as if asleep at the foot of a rock. Wang knew the man was British, he said, by the old-fashioned clothing, rotted and disintegrating at the touch, and poked his finger into his cheek to indicate an injury.
However, Wang was killed in an avalanche the following day before more information could be obtained.

Further confirmation of this sighting was provided by a 1986 conversation that American Everest historian Tom Holzel had with Zhang Junyan, Wang&#x27;s tent-mate from the 1975 expedition. Zhang said Wang returned from a 20-minute excursion and described finding &quot;a foreign mountaineer&quot; at 8,100 meters.
Since no other European climber was known to have died at that elevation on the north side of Everest, it was almost certain that the body was either Mallory or Irvine, though due to the 1999 discovery of Mallory, it is most likely that Wang saw him.

Wang&#x27;s 1975 sighting was the key to the discovery of Mallory&#x27;s body 24 years later in the same general area, although his reported description of the body he found—&quot;hole in cheek&quot;—is not consistent with the condition and posture of Mallory&#x27;s body, which was face down, his head almost completely buried in scree, and with a golfball-sized puncture wound on his forehead. One possibility is that Wang actually saw Irvine. Another is that Wang discovered Mallory face up and turned his body over to effect a simple burial.

In 2001, the second Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition discovered Wang&#x27;s 1975 campsite location and made an extensive search of its surroundings, and found that Mallory&#x27;s remained the only body in the vicinity.

===Sighting by Xu Jing===
In 2001, Eric Simonson, leader of the 1999 Mallory and Irvine Expedition, and German researcher Jochen Hemmleb, who inspired it, travelled to Beijing to interview some of the remaining survivors of the 1960 Chinese Mount Everest expedition, which had been the first expedition back to the north side since the British attempts of the 1920s and 1930s.

During their meeting, the deputy leader of the expedition, Xu Jing, said that on his descent from the First Step, he spotted a dead climber lying on his back, feet facing uphill, in a hollow or slot in the rock. Since no one other than Mallory and Irvine had ever been lost on the north side of Everest before 1960, and Mallory had been found much lower down, it was almost a certainty that Xu had discovered Irvine. However, the sighting was brief, and Xu was in desperate straits during the descent, and while he clearly remembered seeing the body, he was unclear about where it was.

===Sighting by Wang Fuzhou===
A more contemporary account, not dulled by the passage of 40 years, has subsequently surfaced. In 1965, a member of the 1960 Chinese expedition, Wang Fuzhou, gave a lecture in the headquarters of the USSR Geographical Society in Leningrad. While describing the expedition, he made a sensational remark: &quot;At an altitude of about , we found a corpse of a European&quot;. Asked how he could be sure the dead man was European, the Chinese climber replied simply, &quot;He was wearing braces&quot;.

==21st-century searches==
In 2010, a team informally dubbed the Andrew Irvine Search Committee and led by Holzel searched for Irvine in a computer-assembled montage of aerial photographs taken in 1984 by Brad Washburn and the National Geographic Society. They identified a possible object at about , less than from the ice-axe location, consistent with a body lying in a slot of rock, feet pointing toward the summit, just as Xu described his sighting.

A new expedition organised by Holzel was due to explore the upper slopes of Everest in December 2011, presumably with a view to determining the nature of this possible object. By conducting the expedition in winter, it was hoped that there would be much less snow on the upper slopes, increasing the chances of finding Irvine, as well as the camera that it is hoped will be with him.

In 2019, Mark Synnott led a party that investigated the &#x27;crevice&#x27; identified by Holzel as the potential resting place of Irvine, but discovered that it was merely an optical illusion. Synnott later reported on the possibility that the 1975 Chinese expedition may have found both Irvine and the camera.

===Discovery of partial remains===
In 2024, a &quot;National Geographic&quot; team led by Jimmy Chin found Irvine&#x27;s partial remains on Everest. It is believed that the remains had emerged from a melting glacier. The remains were found at an undisclosed location on the Central Rongbuk Glacier at an altitude at least 7,000 feet lower than where Mallory’s body was discovered. A detached foot inside a boot and sock, with &quot;A. C. Irvine&quot; on a name tape, was found emerging from the ice. The cameras remain missing.

==In popular culture==
The deaths of Mallory and Irvine inspired Baku Yumemakura to write the 1998 novel &quot;The Summit of the Gods,&quot; which in turn inspired a manga series of the same name published from 2000 to 2003, which was adapted into a French-made anime-influenced animation film, &quot;Le Sommet des Dieux&quot;, that was released in 2021.

<doc id="666601" wikidata="Q2375737" url="?curid=666601" title="Synarchism">
<text>Synarchism generally means &quot;joint rule&quot; or &quot;harmonious rule&quot;. Beyond this general definition, both synarchism and synarchy have been used to denote rule by a secret elite in Vichy France, Italy, China, and Hong Kong, while being used to describe a pro-Catholic theocracy movement in Mexico.

==Origins==
The earliest recorded use of the term &quot;synarchy&quot; is attributed to Thomas Stackhouse (1677–1752), an English clergyman who used the word in his &quot;New History of the Holy Bible from the Beginning of the World to the Establishment of Christianity&quot; (published in two folio volumes in 1737). The attribution can be found in the Webster&#x27;s Dictionary (the American Dictionary of the English Language, published by Noah Webster in 1828). Webster&#x27;s definition for &quot;synarchy&quot; is limited entirely to &quot;joint rule or sovereignty&quot;. The word is derived from the Greek stems &quot;syn&quot; meaning &quot;with&quot; or &quot;together&quot; and &quot;archy&quot; meaning &quot;rule&quot;.

The most substantial early use of the word &quot;synarchy&quot; comes from the writings of Alexandre Saint-Yves d&#x27;Alveydre (1842–1909), who used the term in his book &quot;La France vraie&quot; to describe what he believed was the ideal form of government. In reaction to the emergence of anarchist ideologies and movements, Saint-Yves elaborated a political formula which he believed would lead to a harmonious society. He defended social differentiation and hierarchy with collaboration between social classes, transcending conflict between social and economic groups: synarchy, as opposed to anarchy. Specifically, Saint-Yves envisioned a Federal Europe (as well as all the states it has integrated) with a corporatist government composed of three councils, one for academia, one for the judiciary, and one for commerce.

==Rule by a secret elite==
The word &quot;synarchy&quot; is used, especially among French and Spanish speakers, to describe a shadow government or deep state, a form of government where political power effectively rests with a secret elite, in contrast to an oligarchy where the elite is or could be known by the public.

===Pacte Synarchique===
The Pacte Synarchique is a historical theory that the surrender of Vichy France was as a result of a conspiracy by French industrial and banking interests to surrender France to Hitler in order to fight Communism. The original Pacte was supposedly discovered after the death in 1941 of Jean Coutrot, former member of Groupe X-Crise. According to this document, a &quot;Mouvement Synarchique d&#x27;Empire&quot; had been founded in 1922 with the aim of abolishing parliamentarianism and replacing it with synarchy. A Vichy investigation found no evidence for the &quot;Mouvement Synarchiste d&#x27;Empire&quot; existence. Most of the presumed synarchists were either associated with the Banque Worms or with Groupe X-Crise and were close to Admiral François Darlan the Vichy prime minister (1941–1942). Most historians agree that the &quot;Pacte&quot; was a hoax created by some French collaborators with Nazi Germany to weaken Darlan and his Vichy technocrats.

===Lyndon LaRouche===
Lyndon LaRouche, leader of the LaRouche movement, described a wide-ranging historical phenomenon, starting with Alexandre Saint-Yves d&#x27;Alveydre and the Martinist Order followed by important individuals, organizations, movements and regimes that are alleged to have been synarchist, including the government of Nazi Germany. He claimed that during the Great Depression an international coalition of financial institutions, raw materials cartels, and intelligence operatives installed fascist regimes throughout Europe (and tried to do so in Mexico) to maintain world order and prevent the repudiation of international debts. LaRouche identified the former U.S. vice president and former PNAC member Dick Cheney as a modern &quot;synarchist&quot;, and claimed that &quot;synarchists&quot; have &quot;a scheme for replacing regular military forces of nations, by private armies in the footsteps of a privately financed international Waffen-SS like scheme, a force deployed by leading financier institutions, such as the multi-billions funding by the U.S. Treasury, of Cheney&#x27;s Halliburton gang.&quot;

==Other uses==

===Qing China===
Harvard historian and sinologist John K. Fairbank used the word &quot;synarchy&quot; in his 1953 book &quot;Trade and Diplomacy on the China Coast: The Opening of the Treaty Ports, 1842–1854&quot;, and in later writings, to describe the mechanisms of government under the Qing dynasty in China. Fairbank&#x27;s synarchy is a form of joint rule by co-opting existing Manchu and Han Chinese elites and bringing the foreign powers into the system and legitimizing them through a schedule of rituals and tributes that gave them a stake in the Qing dynasty rule. He believed that the Qing, who were considered outside rulers because of their Manchu origins, developed this strategy out of necessity because they did not have a strong political base in China.

===Hong Kong===
The term is also used by some political scientists to describe the British colonial government in Hong Kong (1842–1997). Ambrose King, in his 1975 paper &quot;Administrative Absorption of Politics in Hong Kong&quot;, described colonial Hong Kong&#x27;s administration as &quot;elite consensual government&quot;. In it, he claimed, any coalition of elites or forces capable of challenging the legitimacy of Hong Kong&#x27;s administrative structure would be co-opted by the existing apparatus through the appointment of leading political activists, business figures and other elites to oversight committees, by granting them British honours, and by bringing them into elite institutions like Hong Kong&#x27;s horse racing clubs. He called this &quot;synarchy&quot;, by extension of Fairbank&#x27;s use of the word.

===Mexican synarchism===

&quot;Synarchy&quot; is also the name of the ideology of a political movement in Mexico dating from the 1930s. In Mexico, it was historically a movement of the Roman Catholic extreme right, in some ways akin to fascism, violently opposed to the populist and secularist policies of the revolutionary (PNR, PRM, and PRI) governments that ruled Mexico from 1929 to 2000.

The National Synarchist Union &quot;(Unión Nacional Sinarquista,&quot; UNS) was founded in May 1937 by a group of Catholic political activists led by José Antonio Urquiza, who was murdered in April 1938, and Salvador Abascal as a revival of the Cristero movement. In 1946, a faction of the movement loyal to deposed leader Manuel Torres Bueno regrouped as the Popular Force Party (Partido Fuerza Popular). Synarchism revived as a political movement in the 1970s through the Mexican Democratic Party (PDM), whose candidate, Ignacio González Gollaz, polled 1.8 percent of the vote at the 1982 presidential election. In 1988 Gumersindo Magaña polled a similar proportion, but the party then suffered a split, and, in 1992, lost its registration as a political party. It was dissolved in 1996.

There are now two organisations, both calling themselves the Unión Nacional Sinarquista, one aligning to Francoist policies, the other following the National Syndicalism of Primo De Rivera. Carlos Abascal, son of Salvador Abascal, was Mexico&#x27;s Secretary of the Interior during Vicente Fox&#x27;s presidency. Many &quot;sinarquistas&quot; are now militant in the National Action Party, PAN, of former presidents Vicente Fox (2000–2006) and Felipe Calderón (2006–2012).

<doc id="666604" wikidata="Q1458526" url="?curid=666604" title="List of The Sopranos episodes">
<text>&quot;The Sopranos&quot; is an American crime drama television series created by David Chase. The series follows Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), an Italian-American mobster, as he struggles with various personal and professional obstacles. It also explores Tony&#x27;s relationships with members of his biological and criminal families, most notably his wife Carmela (Edie Falco) and his protégé, Christopher Moltisanti (Michael Imperioli). The show begins when Tony begins therapy with Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco) after suffering a panic attack.

The series premiered on January 10, 1999, on HBO and concluded on June 10, 2007. Broadcast syndication followed in the United States and internationally. The first five seasons of the series each consisted of 13 episodes, while the final season consisted of 21 episodes aired in two parts. Unlike most American shows at the time, which typically took a four-month hiatus between seasons, &quot;The Sopranos&quot; took longer hiatuses between its seasons. Season four, for example, premiered 16 months after the third season finale, and the sixth season returned almost two years after the end of season five. Episodes were broadcast on Sundays at 9:00 pm Eastern Time with an average length of 55 minutes per episode. All six seasons are available on DVD and Blu-ray, with the sixth season being sold in two parts. During the course of the series, 86 episodes of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; aired over six seasons.

The series was released to widespread critical acclaim and received numerous accolades. It is often credited with ushering in the Second Golden Age of Television and is considered among the most influential series ever. Since its conclusion, &quot;The Sopranos&quot; has been cited by some as the greatest television series of all time, with &quot;TV Guide&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; naming it the best series of all time in 2013 and 2022 respectively.

<doc id="666606" wikidata="Q5214633" url="?curid=666606" title="Dan and Frank Carney">
<text>Brothers Dan (born 1931) and Frank Carney (April 26, 1938 – December 2, 2020) were American businessmen who founded the pizza restaurant chain Pizza Hut.

==Early years ==
Dan and Frank Carney were born into a blended family of twelve children, and raised in Wichita, Kansas, where Dan still lives today. Although Frank Carney dropped out of Wichita State University, where he studied engineering, he later returned to the university to receive a degree in general studies and mathematics.

==Pizza Hut==
In 1958, the brothers borrowed $600 from their mother and opened a pizza restaurant catering to students after a local real estate agent with an unrented building convinced them that pizza would be a promising business. Although they knew little about pizza-making or business, they learned quickly and the business started to grow. Their first franchise opened in Topeka, Kansas, in 1959. The Pizza Hut in Aggieville, Kansas, was the first to have delivery, an innovation. By 1977, Pizza Hut had grown to 4,000 outlets and the brothers decided to sell the business to PepsiCo for over $300 million USD. Frank remained the president and a board member of Pizza Hut until 1980.

The Carney brothers have been featured in the History Channel series &quot;The Food That Built America&quot;.
==Later years==

=== Frank ===
Frank became a franchisee of Papa John&#x27;s Pizza in 1994. By 2001, he owned 133 locations. Based in Houston, his company runs stores in Kansas, Arizona, Missouri, California, Texas and Hawaii, including several in his hometown of Wichita and the suburbs of Derby and Andover, under the franchise name PJ Wichita LLC., before selling the franchise to then Franchise President Terry Newman. During legal struggles with Pizza Hut in the late 1990s, Papa John&#x27;s ran commercial advertisements highlighting the fact, including a dramatization showing Frank coming to a Pizza Hut stockholders&#x27; meeting wearing a Papa John&#x27;s apron, saying, &quot;Sorry, guys. I found a better pizza.&quot;

Frank sat on the board of Intrust Financial Corp., Intrust Bank, N.A. He was the past president of the International Franchise Association (IFA) and the Wichita Area Chamber of Commerce. Industry honors include the 1975 Silver Plate Award from the International Foodservice Manufacturers Association, and the 1974 Man Of The Year in the Multi-Unit Foodservice Organization. He received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1976. He was a 1991 inductee into the IFA Hall of Fame.

Frank was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 2009. He died from pneumonia following a recovery from COVID-19, at 4:30am on December 2, 2020, at the age of 82.

=== Dan ===
Dan spent several years of his adult life playing recreational polo along with his son, professional polo player, Mike Carney, president of Fairfield Polo Club in Wichita, Kansas. In 2001 he was awarded the Junior Achievement Wichita Business Hall of Fame.

<doc id="666610" wikidata="Q336710" url="?curid=666610" title="Surgical strike">
<text>A surgical strike is a military attack which is intended to damage only a legitimate military target, with no or minimal collateral damage to surrounding structures, vehicles, buildings, or the general public infrastructure and utilities.

==Description==
A swift and targeted attack with the aim of minimum collateral damage to the nearby areas and civilians is a surgical strike. Neutralization of targets with surgical strikes also prevents escalation to a full-blown war. Surgical strike attacks can be carried out via air strike, airdropping special ops teams or a swift ground operation or by sending special troops.

Precision bombing is another example of a surgical strike carried out by aircraft – it can be contrasted against carpet bombing, the latter which results in high collateral damage and a wide range of destruction over an affected area which may or may not include high civilian casualties. The bombing of Baghdad during the initial stages of the 2003 invasion of Iraq by US forces, known as &quot;shock and awe&quot; is an example of a coordinated surgical strike, where government buildings and military targets were systematically attacked by US aircraft in an attempt to cripple the Ba&#x27;athist controlled Iraqi government under Saddam Hussein.

==Examples==
=== Azerbaijan ===
On October 14, 2020, during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Azerbaijan carried out surgical strikes against Armenian forces and destroyed three R-17 Elbrus tactical ballistic missile launchers in Kalbajar District, &quot;de jure&quot; part of Azerbaijan, but under &quot;de facto&quot; independent Artsakh&#x27;s control. According to Azerbaijan, the missile launchers had been targeting Ganja and Mingachevir, and the strike was in retaliation of the 11 October Ganja ballistic missile attack, which resulted in ten civilians getting killed and 40 more getting injured, with women and children being among the victims. Armenia confirmed that sites within Armenia had been struck while continuing to deny it had attacked Azerbaijan.

===Israel===
Israel&#x27;s Entebbe raid in 1976, through which Israeli passengers were freed from a hijacked plane that landed in Uganda, is considered a successful surgical strike. Even though it did not involve taking out a specific military target, the operation was carried out deep inside foreign territory and the IDF commandos travelled 5,000 miles from start to finish without engaging any other forces or causing any collateral damage to the country where the operation took place, thus befitting the term.

Israel&#x27;s 1981 bombing of the Iraqi nuclear reactor Osirak is considered a prime example of a surgical strike.

===United States===
The 1986 bombing of targets in the Libyan cities of Tripoli and Benghazi were carried out using surgical strike tactics, with both ground-based and carrier-based attack aircraft striking airports, barracks, and military training centers. The stated goals of the attack were to cripple Libya&#x27;s ability to train and support terrorists, but it has been rumored that the attack was also an assassination attempt on Muammar Gaddafi.

The United States carried out numerous surgical strikes against Al-Qaeda targets in Afghanistan using cruise missiles. It also used the same technology against a purported chemical weapons facility in Sudan.

<doc id="666611" wikidata="Q67535" url="?curid=666611" title="Julius Curtius">
<text>Julius Curtius (7 February 1877 – 10 November 1948) was a German politician who served as Minister for Economic Affairs (from January 1926 to December 1929) and Foreign Minister of the Weimar Republic (from October/November 1929 to October 1931).

==Early life==
Julius Curtius was born on 7 February 1877 at Duisburg in what was then the Prussian Rhine Province.

His father Friedrich (1850-1904) owned an ultramarine works at Duisburg and an alum works at . Friedrich&#x27;s brother was Theodor Curtius, a professor of chemistry. Julius&#x27; mother was Adele (1824–98, née Brockhoff).

Julius married Adda Carp (1883-1967), sister of industrialist Werner Carp, in 1905. They had two sons and three daughters.

Curtius studied law at Kiel, Strasbourg and Bonn and was awarded a doctorate at Berlin. In 1905, he started practicing law at Duisburg. After 1911, he began working on issues in the field of public policy (&quot;Staatswissenschaften&quot;) at Heidelberg. He served in the First World War, finishing at the rank of &quot;Hauptmann&quot; (captain) of the &quot;Landwehr&quot; and &quot;Batterieführer&quot; and was awarded both Iron Crosses. He remained at Heidelberg where he also was a member of the city council (&quot;Stadtverordneter&quot;) until 1921. He then worked as a lawyer at the &quot;Kammergericht Berlin&quot;. He mainly represented (also as a member of supervisory boards) firms in the steel and coal, potash and railway rolling stock businesses. From 1920 to 1932, he was a member of the Reichstag for the German People&#x27;s Party (DVP).

==Minister==
Curtius became &quot;Reichswirtschaftsminister&quot; (Minister for Economic Affairs) in January 1926 as a member of the second cabinet of Hans Luther and remained in that office in several different cabinets that followed. After Gustav Stresemann died on 3 October 1929, Curtius became the acting Foreign Minister and in November vacated his old position and took over the &quot;Auswärtiges Amt&quot;.

As a minister he supported job-creation schemes and a close cooperation with the Soviet Union, especially in economic affairs. His main achievement was - as collaborator and &quot;heir&quot; of Stresemann - progress in the question of wartime reparations and the return of the occupied Rhineland. As the minister responsible for the Young Plan, Curtius was heavily criticized by DNVP, &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot;, Nazis and the Pan-German League, who labelled him a &quot;traitor to the fatherland&quot;.

Curtius unsuccessfully worked with Austria&#x27;s Johann Schober in March 1931 to set up a German-Austrian custom union. However, France blocked this by putting economic pressure on Austria and by bringing about a decision by the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague, which voted 8:7 to rule the union in contradiction of the Geneva protocol of 1922 (see &quot;&quot;). This caused Curtius to resign on 3 October 1931.

To prevent the union being established, the French had withdrawn a number of short loans they had made to Austria; the withdrawal of the French loans helped to cause the collapse of Creditanstalt, Austria&#x27;s largest bank, in May 1931, which in its turn brought about a series of banking collapses all over Central Europe in the summer of 1931.

Curtius was intimately involved in the negotiations that led to the issuing of the Hoover Moratorium by the U.S President Herbert Hoover that halted war reparations payments by Germany in June 1931 as part of the effort to limit the financial fall-out of the banking collapse.

==Later life and death==
Following his resignation, Curtius left politics and worked as a lawyer, asset manager and farmer. After his house in Berlin was destroyed in World War II and his estate in Mecklenburg was seized by the Communist authorities he moved to Heidelberg in July 1946. Curtius died at Heidelberg on 10 November 1948.

<text>The Packard Hawk is a model of automobile. It was the sportiest of the four Packard-badged Studebakers produced in 1958, the final year of Packard production.

==History and description==
The Packard Plant in Detroit, Michigan had been leased to Curtiss-Wright (and would be soon sold to them), and Packard models in this dying-gasp year were all rebadged and retrimmed Studebaker products. The 1958 Packard Hawk was essentially a Studebaker Golden Hawk 400 with a fiberglass front end and modified deck lid. It was positioned as an alternative to the market favorite Ford Thunderbird, which offered an all-new version in 1958 as well.

Instead of the Studebaker Hawk&#x27;s upright Mercedes-style grille, the Packard Hawk had a wide, low opening just above the front bumper and covering the whole width of the car. Above this, a smoothly sloping nose, and hood—reminiscent of the 1953 Studebakers, but with a bulge as on the Golden Hawk—accommodating the engine&#x27;s McCulloch supercharger that gave the Studebaker 289 in³ (4.7 L) V8 a total of 275 bhp (205 kW). At the rear, the sides of the fins were coated in metallized PET film, giving them a shiny metallic gold appearance. A fake spare-tire bulge adorned the 1953-style Studebaker deck lid. &quot;PACKARD&quot; appeared across the nose, with a gold Packard emblem in script—along with a Hawk badge—on the trunk lid and fins.

The interior was full leather, with full instrumentation in an engine-turned dash. As on early aircraft and custom boats, padded armrests were mounted outside the windows, a rare touch.

The styling was definitely controversial, often described as &#x27;vacuum-cleaner&#x27; or &#x27;catfish&#x27; by detractors. The styling has come to be appreciated more today than in its debut. Only 588 were sold, with Packard&#x27;s impending demise a likely contributing factor. Most were equipped with the Borg-Warner three-speed automatic transmission. Approximately 28 were produced with the B-W T85 3-speed w/overdrive manual transmission. Studebaker-Packard was the first manufacturer to popularize the limited slip differential, which they termed Twin-Traction. Most Packard Hawks came with TT. It was certainly the fastest Packard ever sold, since it shared the majority of its components with Studebaker&#x27;s Golden Hawk. The price was $3995, about $700 higher than the Studebaker model, but with a more luxurious interior. Electric window-lifts and power seats were optional extras.

Its rarity and status as the best-regarded of the &#x27;Packardbaker&#x27; final-year cars have made the Packard Hawk quite collectible. Values are roughly double those of the equivalent Studebaker, although they are still low by comparison with Corvettes and Thunderbirds. Because a Studebaker drivetrain was used, mechanical parts are more readily available, although body and trim parts are more difficult-to-impossible to find. While it is a unique car, current restoration costs almost always exceed the selling price.

<text>Norwegian Postal Codes are four-digit codes, known in Norwegian as (literally &#x27;post number&#x27;). Posten, the Norwegian postal service, makes small modifications to the postal code system each year. In 1999, Posten made considerable changes to the postal codes in Norway.

Since 18 March 1968 Norway has used a four-digit system: . The numbers start at 00 and increase with the distance from the capital city Oslo. The highest post numbers are found in the county of Finnmark, near the Russian border, where they start with 95–99. The lowest post code in use is 0001 (Oslo Municipality), the highest 9991 (Båtsfjord Municipality).

== Postal number regions ==

<text>Stopan () is a village in the Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kotor Varoš Municipality, Šiprage local community. At the census in 1991, Stopan had a population of 346. According to preliminary results of the census 2013 there were 119 citizens.

== Geography ==
Stopan is located on the pass (altitude about 680 m) sandwiched between Crkvenica and Stopanski river, right tributaries of Vrbanja river. From this village to Šiprage there is a mostly gravel local road, length of about 8 km.

Stopan used to be a relatively big village in Šiprage&#x27;s area, with drinking water, orchards, domestic fruit products, and hospitality.

== History==
During World War II, the village took part in the defense forces and was a significant partisan jump refuge. In January 1944, it received a large number of wounded partisans, who were evacuated from the Divisional Hospital in the gorge of Demićka, near Šiprage, during the sixth enemy offensive. Because of the distance of the main local communications, Stopan was a safer refuge for the civilian inhabitants of surrounding localities.

During the War in Bosnia (1992–1995), army, police, and paramilitary forces of the Republika Srpska destroyed the surrounding Bosniak villages, especially those upstream of Vrbanja to Kruševo Brdo as well as those downstream to Banja Luka. Local inhabitants were being killed, and the majority were expelled. After 1996, most Bosniak villages in Šiprage community were partly restored, thanks to the BELUGA battalion of the EUFOR-SFOR Mission. The only mosque in the wide area was renewed.

<text>The Bills were a youth subculture active in Léopoldville, Belgian Congo in the late 1950s, basing much of their image and outlook on the cowboys of American Western movies. Its name was taken from Buffalo Bill.

==Background==
Bills were gangs of teenagers that dressed in cowboy outfits and went against the prevailing political views of the time. They wore cowboy hats that were brown and had cowboy boots. From 1957 to 1959, half a dozen movie theaters opened in the &quot;African&quot; neighborhoods in Léopoldville (the city was segregated into African and European areas). The majority of Léopoldville&#x27;s population was under 20, and most of these youths were educated to only primary level, since the colonial government reserved most of the secondary school places for Europeans. Poor education resulted in large scale unemployment, and, with little else to do, the youths began to make the theaters their meeting points. They were particularly drawn to Western movies, and &quot;Billism&quot; began to incorporate many of the motifs into their lives. The portrayal of Buffalo Bill in the movies was especially appealing partly because of the similarity to hunter heroes of Congolese culture. The character of Buffalo Bill had already appeared in over 20 films by that time, but the most influential movie is thought to be &quot;Pony Express&quot;, where Charlton Heston played Bill.

==Way of life==
The Bills dressed in cowboy outfits (kerchiefs, jeans and shirts) sold in Kinshasa. The names of the &#x27;territories&#x27; for each gang echoed those of the Western United States (Texas, Santa Fe), and the gangs themselves were usually named after their territories (such as the &quot;Texas Bills&quot;), but occasionally strayed outside the Western United States pantheon (such as &quot;Godzilla&quot;). Some commentators have suggested they provided a street-level counterpart to the more refined and overtly political anti-colonial struggle that was then being fought by some of the &quot;évolués&quot; (the middle class educated elite).

==Hindoubill==
The Bills developed their own argot called Hindoubill (or Hindubill). The origins of this name are obscure, but may relate to either the Hindi films occasionally shown in Kinshasa, or to the Bills conflating the Native American &quot;Indians&quot; of &quot;Cowboys and Indians&quot; with the Indians of India (à la Columbus&#x27; mistake).

<text>Frederic-Hans von Rosenberg (26 December 1874 – 30 July 1937) was a German diplomat and politician. He served as &quot;Reichsaußenminister&quot; (Foreign Minister of Germany) in the cabinet of Wilhelm Cuno in 1922–1923.

== Early life ==
Rosenberg was born as Frederic (or Friedrich) Hans von Rosenberg on 26 December 1874 in Berlin, Kingdom of Prussia (present-day Germany).

== Career ==
In 1897, Rosenberg was awarded the degree of Dr.Jur. and entered the Prussian judicial service, in which he was promoted to &quot;Assessor&quot; in 1903. That year he transferred to the foreign service (&quot;Auswärtiges Amt&quot;, AA). In 1910, Rosenberg became the head of the Balkans department at the AA, and in 1912 was promoted to &quot;Vortragender Rat&quot;.

During the First World War, he was a member of the German delegation negotiating with the Soviet Union at Brest-Litowsk and with Romania at Bucharest. In 1918–1919, he was at the German Embassy to Switzerland at Bern. In 1919, Rosenberg became &quot;Dirigent&quot;—head of the political department of the AA. In 1920–22, he was Ambassador at Vienna, and in 1922 briefly at Copenhagen.

He was Foreign Minister of Germany from November 1922 to August 1923 in the cabinet of chancellor Wilhelm Cuno.

From 1924 to 1933, he was Ambassador at Stockholm and then served from 1933 to 1935 as ambassador in Ankara. In 1935, he was given an indefinite leave (&quot;im einstweiligen Ruhestand&quot;).

== Personal life ==
Rosenberg died on 30 July 1937 at Fürstenzell, in Bavaria, Germany.

<doc id="666643" wikidata="Q200478" url="?curid=666643" title="Leonid Nikolaev">
<text>Leonid Vasilevich Nikolaev (10 May 1904 – 29 December 1934) was the Russian assassin of Sergei Kirov, the First Secretary of Leningrad City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

==Early life==
Nikolaev was a troubled young Soviet Communist Party member in Leningrad. He was a small, thin man, about tall; even as an adult he showed the effects of childhood malnutrition. He had difficulty holding a job, and had been reprimanded by the Party for having refused a posting that was not to his liking. Eventually, the Party expelled him as a member. Unemployed, he soon ran short of money, and blamed the Party for his troubles. His Latvian-Russian wife Milda Draule was a member of a regional party committee and he had a strong suspicion that she had a love affair with Sergei Kirov, the Party administrator of the Leningrad district, although no evidence of that has been discovered.

==Assassination of Sergei Kirov==
It is unknown whether Nikolaev had had prior dealings with the Leningrad branch of the Soviet government, headed by Kirov. As Nikolaev&#x27;s troubles grew, he became steadily more obsessed with the idea of &quot;striking a blow&quot;. On 15 October 1934, he was arrested by the NKVD, allegedly for loitering around the Smolny Institute, where Kirov had his offices. The Smolny guards had discovered a loaded 7.62 mm Nagant M1895 revolver in Nikolaev&#x27;s briefcase. Some Soviet sources later argued that Nikolaev did have a permit to carry a loaded handgun. After Nikolaev&#x27;s visit, the NKVD failed to augment Kirov&#x27;s security; instead, it withdrew all police protection for Kirov with the exception of a police escort to Smolny and a guarded security post at the entrance to his offices. 
On the afternoon of 1 December 1934, Nikolaev paid a final visit to the Smolny Institute offices. With Stalin&#x27;s alleged approval, the NKVD had previously withdrawn the remaining guards manning the security desk at Smolny. Unopposed, Nikolaev made his way to the third floor, where he shot Kirov in the back of the neck with his Nagant revolver. As former Soviet official and author Alexander Barmine observed, &quot;the negligence of the NKVD in protecting such a high party official was without precedent in the Soviet Union&quot;. According to later press accounts and party communiques, which were never substantiated, Nikolaev was apprehended with the aid of an electrician, Platanov, who was working in the area; a friend of Kirov&#x27;s, a middle-aged man named Borisov, also rushed out and helped subdue Nikolaev, who was said to have undergone a complete collapse and had to be carried away.

==Aftermath and responsibility for Kirov&#x27;s death==
After Kirov&#x27;s death, Stalin called for swift punishment of the traitors and those found negligent in Kirov&#x27;s death. Borisov, one of the first to come upon the scene, was immediately arrested; he died the day after Kirov&#x27;s assassination, allegedly as the result of a fall from a truck in which he was being transported by the NKVD. On 28–29 December 1934, Nikolaev and 13 other people as members of the &quot;counterrevolutionary group&quot; were tried by the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR under Vasili Ulrikh&#x27;s chairmanship. At 5:45 a.m., 29 December, all of them were sentenced to death and executed by shooting an hour later.

Several NKVD officers from the Leningrad branch were convicted of negligence for not adequately protecting Kirov and were sentenced to prison terms of up to ten years. Barmine claimed they never served their prison sentences; instead, they were transferred to executive posts in Stalin&#x27;s labour camps for a period of time (in effect, a demotion). Initially, a Communist Party communiqué reported that Nikolaev&#x27;s guilt had been established and that he had confessed that he acted at the behest of a &#x27;fascist power&#x27;, receiving money from an unidentified &#x27;foreign consul&#x27; in Leningrad. Barmine further claimed 104 other defendants, who were already in prison at the time of Kirov&#x27;s assassination, who had no demonstrable connection to Nikolaev, were found guilty of complicity in the &#x27;fascist plot&#x27; against Kirov and were summarily executed.

A few days later, during a Communist Party meeting of the Moscow District, the Party secretary announced in a speech that Nikolaev had been personally interrogated by Stalin the very next day after the assassination, an unheard-of event for a party leader such as Stalin, &quot;Comrade Stalin personally directed the investigation of Kirov&#x27;s assassination. He questioned Nikolaev at length. The leaders of the Opposition placed the gun in Nikolaev&#x27;s hand!&quot; Other speakers rose to condemn the Opposition, &quot;The Central Committee must be pitiless – the Party must be purged ... the record of every member must be scrutinized ... .&quot; No one at the meeting mentioned the theory of fascist agents. Later, Stalin used the Kirov assassination to eliminate the remainder of the Opposition leadership against him, accusing Grigory Zinoviev, Lev Kamenev, Abram Prigozhin and others who had stood with Kirov in opposing Stalin (or simply failed to acquiesce to Stalin&#x27;s views), of having connections with Nikolaev and facilitating the assassination. 
After Nikolaev&#x27;s death, there was some speculation that his motivation in killing Kirov may have been more personal. His wife worked at the Smolny and unsubstantiated rumours surfaced that she was having an affair with Kirov. It is unknown whether these had a basis in fact, or were deliberately fostered by the NKVD. According to Amy Knight, Nikolaev&#x27;s wife, Milda Draule, was noted for her physical plainness, while Kirov was known to prefer liaisons with ballerinas and other Soviet women of notable beauty and grace. Other theories claim that Stalin himself was involved in the assassination. This claim originates from former Soviet colonel and defector Alexander Orlov. However, Robert W. Thurston notes that nothing in Nikolaev&#x27;s personal diary indicates that he did not carry out the assassination on his own.

Kirov&#x27;s death was an important turning point in the period of increasing political repression that led up to Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge. Author and Menshevik scholar Boris Nikolaevsky observed, &quot;One thing is certain: the only man who profited by the Kirov assassination was Stalin.&quot;

<text>Terror Squad was an American hip hop collective that was first established in 1998. Based in the Bronx in New York City, the members of Terror Squad collectively debuted on a song in member Fat Joe&#x27;s albums &quot;Jealous One&#x27;s Envy&quot; and &quot;Don Cartagena&quot;. Terror Squad released its debut album, &quot;Terror Squad: The Album&quot;, in 1999, with its first major hit &quot;Whatcha Gon&#x27; Do&quot;, credited mostly to Big Pun, who died of a heart attack in 2000. After Big Pun&#x27;s death, his longtime partners Cuban Link and Triple Seis left the group and were subsequently replaced by Remy Martin (later known as Remy Ma) and Tony Sunshine. In 2004, their song &quot;Lean Back&quot; peaked at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==History==
Joseph Cartagena aka Fat Joe and Felix Delgado aka Charlie Rock LD were founding members of the Terror Squad. In 1995, some of the members of Terror Squad debuted as a group on Fat Joe&#x27;s album &quot;Jealous One&#x27;s Envy&quot;, in addition to appearing on Big Pun&#x27;s Capital Punishment and Joe&#x27;s Don Cartagena LP. Terror Squad, in its debut album &quot;Terror Squad: The Album&quot;, consisted of rappers Fat Joe, Big Pun, Cuban Link, Prospect (Richard Perez), Armageddon (John Eaddy), and Triple Seis (Sammy Garcia).

As the group was on hiatus following Pun&#x27;s death, most of its former members fell into obscurity, with Fat Joe having the most successful solo career among all the former members. The group reunited and released their second album, &quot;True Story&quot;, in 2004. It included the summer club hit &quot;Lean Back&quot;, produced by Scott Storch, which peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and 24 in the UK. A remix to &quot;Lean Back&quot; featured Lil Jon, Mase and Eminem was released on Fat Joe&#x27;s 2005 album &quot;All or Nothing&quot;. Although the album failed to spawn other hit singles, Fat Joe and Remy, who contributed the vocals to &quot;Lean Back&quot;, went on to release high-selling solo albums in 2006.

Terror Squad signed to Koch Records that next year. Apart from the three new members, DJ Khaled and Cool &amp; Dre are retained as regular crew along with Tony Sunshine.

<doc id="666651" wikidata="Q3844042" url="?curid=666651" title="Malvern Preparatory School">
<text>Malvern Preparatory School, commonly referred to as Malvern Prep, is an independent, all-boys Catholic middle school and college preparatory high school in Malvern, Pennsylvania, within the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. The school is operated by Order of Saint Augustine and is a member of the Augustinian Secondary Education Association.

Malvern Prep is a member of the Inter-Academic League which also includes Episcopal Academy, Germantown Academy, Penn Charter, The Haverford School, and Springside Chestnut Hill Academy.

==History==
Malvern Prep was founded as a preparatory academy on the campus of Villanova University in 1842 at the Belle-Aire farm, which the Augustinian order purchased in January 1842. The academy was named &quot;St. Nicholas of Tolentine Academy&quot; in 1901.

In 1922, due to the expansion of Villanova&#x27;s college program and increasing distinctions being made between the attendees of the academy and the college, it was decided to remove the academy from Villanova&#x27;s campus. The Rosengarten family of Malvern sold a part of its old farm between Warren Avenue and Paoli Pike to the Augustinians, and the academy became Malvern Preparatory School. The property included the site of the Paoli Massacre, a Revolutionary War battlefield that Malvern Prep owned until 2000, when the local municipality, the Borough of Malvern, purchased it for preservation purposes. Only two original buildings were suitable for classes and are still preserved; these are the original farmhouse (Austin Hall) and another farm building (the Friary, or Alber&#x27;s Hall). Because the school needed more space, it built three new buildings in 1924. The first graduating class of Malvern Prep, almost all of whom were boarders, graduated in 1927.

Malvern Prep reached 200 students in 1953 and went through another construction phase, erecting six new buildings in the next eight years. Over the next twenty years, the number of boarders decreased, eventually to zero; the school is now entirely a day school. The school erected a new indoor sports center (O&#x27;Neill Sports Center), a dining hall (Stewart Hall, a then-existing building, Villanova Hall), and several athletic fields in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Malvern Prep has undergone several new constructions in recent years, with a new art center named in honor of the former president, Reverend David J. Duffy, O.S.A. &#x27;48, and a new outdoor athletic complex bearing the name of legendary former football coach Gamp Pellegrini.

===Augustinians in North America===

The North American Augustinian order was founded in 1796 when Irish friars arrived in Philadelphia. Michael Hurley was the first American to join the order the following year. Friars established schools, a university, and other works throughout the Americas, also including Villanova University in Philadelphia and Merrimack College. While this school was founded in 1842, by 1909, two Augustinian houses and a school had been established in Chicago, 1922 in San Diego, by 1925 a school in Ojai and Los Angeles; 1926 a school in Oklahoma; in 1947 Merrimack College; in 1953 a school in Pennsylvania; 1954 a school in Detroit, Michigan; 1959 a school in New Jersey and in 1962 a school in Illinois.

==Curriculum==

Malvern offers Advanced Placement courses in Computer Science, Literature and Composition, French, Spanish, Latin, Calculus (AB and BC), Statistics, Biology, Chemistry, Physics (Mechanics and Electro/Magnetism), Environmental Science, Economics (Micro and Macro), U.S. Government, and U.S. History. Malvern also offers a wide variety of elective/humanities courses such as Music Theory, Entrepreneurship, Elements of Philosophy, Medical Ethics, Music Recording and Technology, and Graphic Design.

Graduates from Malvern typically attend schools such as Villanova University, the University of Notre Dame, Boston College, the University of Pennsylvania, Cornell University, Georgetown University, Pennsylvania State University, Drexel University, and Johns Hopkins University.

== Extracurricular activities ==
=== Athletics ===

Malvern, a member of the Inter-Ac League, participates in sixteen varsity sports: baseball, basketball, crew, cross country, football, golf, ice hockey, indoor track, lacrosse, soccer, squash, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, water polo, wrestling, rugby, and sailing. Malvern competes for the Heyward Cup with five other schools: Germantown Academy, Haverford School, Springside Chestnut Hill Academy, William Penn Charter, and Episcopal Academy. Malvern last won the Heyward Cup in the 2017–18 academic year.

==== Football and basketball ====
Malvern Prep&#x27;s football and basketball programs are two of the most successful in southeast Pennsylvania, frequently finishing in the &quot;Inquirer&#x27;s Top Ten&quot;, published by &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;. The football team is currently coached by Dave Gueriera, and Paul Romanczuk is head coach of the school&#x27;s basketball team.

====Ice hockey====
Malvern&#x27;s Ice Hockey team holds the most titles in the Varsity AAA Flyers Cup, the highest level of High School Hockey in PA. Malvern won the Varsity AAA Flyers Cup five consecutive seasons 2001 to 2005 (8 in succession; 1987, 1990, and 1997). Malvern has also won the Pennsylvania Varsity AAA State Championship twice (1990 &amp; 2004). Head coach Dave Dorman leads the current team. Many former players have gone on to play Division 1 (NCAA), Division 1 Club (ACHA), and even professionally in the NHL and across Europe.

====Rugby====
Malvern started a rugby team in the spring of 2010, playing in the Brandywine district of EPRU. Malvern learned to play the game under head coach Dennis Melesky and Assistant Wayne DiMarco. Soon the team was hitting the pitch and playing experienced teams. The team ended up finishing 6–1 on the season.

====Lacrosse, baseball and cross country====
In 2006, Malvern Prep&#x27;s Lacrosse team, coached by John McEvoy, went on to win the Pennsylvania State Lacrosse Championship and boasts three All-Americans. Also, Malvern Prep&#x27;s baseball team finished off the season by winning the Pennsylvania Independent School&#x27;s tournament. The baseball team could not win the state championship because the Inter-Ac league is not part of the PIAA. The six senior baseball players are all moving on to play at the next level in college. The Cross Country team has won the Inter-Ac Championships the past five years, including a perfect 15 points in 2005 (placed 1st through 5th). The Cross Country team has run at the Nike Northeastern Regionals. In 2014, the Lacrosse team was undefeated, capturing the coveted &quot;24-0&quot; season.
In 2015, the Malvern Prep Varsity Baseball team won the Inter-ac for the fifth straight year, thus completing the &quot;Five Peat&quot;.

====Rowing====
In 2004, the varsity quad won its first SRA National title in addition to a USRowing National Youth Invitational Championship, Philadelphia City Championship, and a second-place finish at the Stotesbury Cup. In the summer of 2004, the team elected to train together. Two of its varsity quad members, Pat Ryan and Justin Teti, represented the United States at the Junior World Championships in Banyoles, Spain, in the double event.

In 2005 the varsity squad won the Stotesbury Cup and repeated its victories at SRA Nationals and the USRowing Youth Invitational. Again the following summer, the team continued to train together and competed at the prestigious Henley Royal Regatta in England, where they advanced to the quarterfinals.

In 2007 the Malvern Varsity Quad won the triple crown, coming in first place at the Philadelphia City Championship and again repeating victories at SRA Nationals and the Stotesbury Cup Regatta. They also traveled overseas to compete at the Henley Royal Regatta. The varsity quad made it to the quarterfinals of the Fawley Challenge Cup Event.

In 2008 the Varsity Quad went undefeated, won at Philadelphia City Championship, SRA Nationals, Stotesbury Cup, USRowing Youth Nationals, and have made it to the semifinals of the Fawley Challenge Cup before losing. They also were selected to represent the United States at the Can Am Mex cup.

In 2013 the Varsity Heavyweight Quad of Christian Frey, Alex Stozcko, Jim Sincavage, and Christopher White won an SRA National Championship.

In 2014 The Varsity Heavyweight Quad followed up with another SRA National Championship with a crew of Jim Sincavage, Christian Frey, C White, and Jackson Connor.

Head coach Craig Hoffman led the rowing program for over a decade. Throughout his tenure as head coach, Hoffman has guided Malvern to among the elite rowing schools in the country. Hoffman has won numerous national championships, city championships, and Stotesbury Cups. Hoffman also has helped coach to United States National Rowing Team.

Many former Malvern rowers have continued to go on and represent the United States in rowing. Malvern consistently sends rowers to top rowing schools like University of Washington, Yale University, Dartmouth College, Princeton University, University of California Berkeley, University of Pennsylvania, Cornell University, and Columbia University.

====Golf====
Malvern Prep has a JV and Varsity team that competes in the fall season with other Inter-Ac and public schools. Malvern has won the inter-ac title many times. Malvern practices at Applebrook CC and uses Waynesborough CC for its home matches. Malvern has sent many golfers to Division 1 programs, including Princeton, Penn, Lehigh, UVA, and Villanova. Malvern also holds several course records in the area for high school matches.

====Water polo====
Malvern Prep has both an Upper School and a Middle School water polo team. Malvern participates in the Inter-Academic League and is consistently one of the top teams in the league. The program was started by Coach Jay Schiller, who currently coaches the Upper School Team. The Middle School team consists of boys from grades 6–8 and competes with Inter-Academic League teams.

<text>Chan Ho Park (; ; born June 30, 1973) is a South Korean former professional baseball pitcher. Park was the first South Korean-born player in MLB history, and the first South Korean player to be named an MLB All-Star. He played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Texas Rangers, San Diego Padres, New York Mets, Philadelphia Phillies, New York Yankees, and Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball (MLB), the Orix Buffaloes of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), and the Hanwha Eagles of the KBO League. As of 2023, he has the most career wins of any Asia-born pitcher in history (124), having passed Hideo Nomo for that distinction in .
 During his playing days, Park stood tall, weighing .

==Early life and career in South Korea==
Chan Ho Park was born in Gongju, South Korea, on June 30, 1973. As a high school player in South Korea, he won team Most Valuable Player honors three consecutive seasons at Gongju High School in Gongju, South Korea. He also was named the MVP at four national prep tournaments.

Park was a member of the 1992 and 1993 South Korea national baseball team. He posted a 2.76 ERA in helping South Korea earn the silver medal at the Asian Baseball Championship in 1993. He also competed in 1993 Summer Universiade, and led his team to the silver medal.

Park was a sophomore at Hanyang University, Seoul in 1994 when he was signed by the Los Angeles Dodgers as an amateur free agent.

In 2015, he and Yang Hak-seon lit the cauldron for the 2015 Summer Universiade held in Gwangju, South Korea.

In 1993, Park Chan-ho attended Hanyang University in Seoul, and in the same year at the Asian Cup held in Perth, Australia, Chinese team hitters Chen Qingguo and Tong Qinghui hit a home run from him. In 1994, the Los Angeles Dodgers snagged Park Chan-ho. He began pitching in 1996 and won his first major league win on April 6.

==Professional career==

===1994–2001: Los Angeles Dodgers===
Park made his professional debut for the Dodgers on April 8, 1994, against the Atlanta Braves as a reliever, working one inning (a game in which the Dodgers were no-hit by the Braves&#x27; Kent Mercker). 

Park played in one additional game for the Dodgers that season and then spent the bulk of the season with the Class AA San Antonio Missions, finishing with a 5–7 record and a 3.55 ERA for the Missions in 20 starts with 100 strikeouts.

With the Albuquerque Dukes in 1995 he was fourth in the Pacific Coast League in strikeouts with 101, and averaged 8.26 strikeouts per 9 innings, the top mark among all Class AAA pitchers. He was selected by Baseball America as the 2nd best Dodgers prospect after the season with the best fastball in the PCL. He recorded his first Major League start on October 1 against the San Diego Padres after receiving a September call-up.

In 1996, his first full season with the Dodgers, he went 5–5 with a 3.64 ERA in 48 games (10 starts). He recorded his first win on April 6 against the Chicago Cubs.

Park had a breakout season in 1997 as he became a full-time starter. He tied for the team lead in victories, while posting a 14–8 record and a 3.38 ERA in 32 appearances, 29 of them starts.

In 1998, he was 15–9 with a 3.71 ERA in 34 starts and struck out 191 batters in 220.2 innings. After the season, he led the South Korean national team to the gold medal in the Asian Games, beating Japan in the final match.

In 1999, he struggled in the rotation with 13–11 with a 5.23 ERA. On April 23, 1999, he became the only pitcher in the history of baseball to allow two grand slams in the same inning and to the same player, Fernando Tatís of the St. Louis Cardinals. It is considered one of the most unbreakable records in the history of baseball. There are two more pitchers in the history of baseball who allowed two grand slams in the same game — Jack Morris, and more recently, Brandon Backe — but to different hitters in different innings. He also walked 100 batters in only 194 innings. On June 5, 1999, Park was involved in an on-field brawl at Dodger Stadium with Anaheim Angels pitcher Tim Belcher. Park attacked Belcher after being tagged out after a bunt play. Park said that Belcher had tagged him too hard on the just-concluded play and asked him about the incident. According to Park, Belcher replied with racist comments causing Park to kick him.

In 2000, he ranked second in strikeouts with 217, second in opposing batting average (.214), and lowest in allowed hits per nine innings. despite second in allowing bases on balls (124) in the National League. He finished the season 18–10 with a 3.27 ERA, the best totals of his entire career. He also tossed his first career complete game shutout on September 29, against the San Diego Padres. Park was also named the Dodgers opening day starter for the 2001 season and tossed the Dodgers first season opening shutout since 1981. He was 15–11 with a 3.50 ERA during the season and was selected to appear in the 2001 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, where he pitched one inning, allowed a home run to Cal Ripken Jr. and was charged with the loss. Park gave up Barry Bonds&#x27; record-breaking 71st and 72nd homers on October 5 against the San Francisco Giants.

===2002–2005: Texas Rangers===
Park was granted free agency after the season and was signed by the Texas Rangers in December of that year to a five-year, $65 million contract, which was one of the largest contracts for a pitcher at that time. However, during his time with the Rangers, he was hampered by injuries and a home stadium that favors hitters. In his first season with the Rangers, Park went 9–8 in 25 starts, with a 5.75 ERA. The following season, he only started seven times due to injuries, going 1–3 with a 7.58 ERA.

On July 29, 2005, he was traded by the Rangers to the San Diego Padres in exchange for Phil Nevin. Padres fans had hoped that Park could repeat his previous success by playing in pitcher-friendly Petco Park.

===2005–2006: San Diego Padres===
In the 2005 season, his combined record was 12–8, despite a 5.74 ERA. In the 2006 season, Park was reunited with his former Texas Rangers teammate and friend Chris Young, who was traded to the Padres in exchange for Akinori Otsuka. Park started the season as a reliever but soon he became a starter. On July 31, he suffered from intestinal bleeding and was placed on the disabled list. Several of his teammates, including Jake Peavy, Woody Williams, Chris Young, and Alan Embree, offered to donate their blood, but Park graciously refused their offer, as they were vital members of the team. Park accepted blood transfusions, that came, in part, from Jake Peavy&#x27;s wife Katie and Kelly Calabrese, the Padres&#x27; team massage therapist. However, Park&#x27;s recovery did not last long as he suffered from another episode of intestinal bleeding on August 21. He was hospitalized again, this time along with his wife Ri-hye, who was about to deliver their first child. A very thorough medical examination revealed that Park was suffering from a congenital defect called Meckel&#x27;s diverticulum. Park had a successful surgery and only six days later his wife delivered a healthy baby daughter at the same hospital.

The San Diego Padres advanced to the post-season and Park joined the postseason roster. On October 3, 2006, Park made his first career postseason appearance in Game 1 of the National League Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals as a reliever. He also had career-high season batting average of .268 from 41 at bats.

===2007: New York Mets &amp; Houston Astros===
On February 8, 2007, the Yonhap news agency and &quot;New York Daily News&quot; reported that Park had signed a one-year, $3 million contract with the New York Mets and would report to the Mets&#x27; spring training facility in Port St. Lucie, Florida to compete for a starting rotation spot. The Mets sent him down to Triple-A New Orleans following his poor spring performance. On April 30, 2007, Park was called up from Triple-A New Orleans to start for the injured Orlando Hernández. In that sole game, he gave up 7 earned runs in 4 innings. On May 3, 2007, Park was sent back down to Triple-A New Orleans. He was designated for assignment on June 4, 2007.

On June 12, 2007, he signed a minor league deal with the Houston Astros. Astros Manager Phil Garner said, &quot;Park will have a few starts at Triple-A Round Rock before the Astros decide whether to call him up.&quot; Park compiled a 2–10 record over 15 starts with Round Rock, failing to earn a spot on the Astros&#x27; 40-man roster.

===2008: Return to the Dodgers===

On November 8, 2007, Park accepted an offer from his original team, the Los Angeles Dodgers, to attend spring training as a non-roster invitee. On November 28, 2007, Park asked to be let go by the Dodgers to play for the Korean national team. After pitching with no health issues for the Korean national team, the contract was finalized on December 6, 2007. Despite being considered a long shot for the fifth starter&#x27;s role, Park pitched very well, but was ultimately passed over for right-hander Esteban Loaiza. He was eventually reassigned to the minor leagues on March 30, 2008. Faced with the problem of a fatigued and depleted pitching staff three games later, the Dodgers purchased Park&#x27;s minor league contract on April 2, 2008.

On May 17, 2008, Park made his first start as a Dodger since 2001 against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. He allowed two runs (one earned run) in four innings with no decision. This game turned out to be a historic one as for the first time in MLB history, all three Dodgers pitchers who pitched in this game (Park, Hong-Chih Kuo, and Takashi Saito) were of Asian origin. The Dodgers won it 6–3.

On June 21, 2008, Park started against the Cleveland Indians at the Dodger Stadium and joined Kevin Brown, Al Leiter, Javier Vázquez, and Jamie Moyer as the only pitchers to start a game against all 30 Major League teams. In addition to making history, he had a decent outing, with nine strikeouts in five innings pitched, although this was overshadowed when he gave up a solo home run to Cleveland Indians pitcher CC Sabathia.

After Takashi Saito&#x27;s elbow injury, Park was moved back to the bullpen by manager Joe Torre. Jonathan Broxton was promoted to the closer role and Park and Hong-Chih Kuo to the setup man platoon.

===2009: Philadelphia Phillies===
On January 6, Park signed a one-year, incentive-laden, $2.5 million contract with the Philadelphia Phillies.
On March 31, Phillies GM Rubén Amaro Jr. announced that Chan Ho Park had won the fifth starter job. However, with several poor starts (7 starts with a 7.29 ERA), Park was moved to the bullpen and was replaced in the rotation by J. A. Happ. The problem with Park as a starter was that he was sacrificing velocity and movement for the energy to go deeper in games. After moving to the pen, his four-seam fastball velocity returned to normal (topped out at 95-96 mph), with movement on his two-seam fastball and slider. Park played a vital role in the Phillies&#x27; bullpen with a 2.52 ERA. After missing time with a hamstring injury, Park made his return to the Phillies in the playoffs. With the Phillies, he advanced to his first World Series, in which he pitched well, giving up no runs in Philadelphia&#x27;s loss to the New York Yankees. He became a free agent after the season.

In December 2009 it was announced that Chan Ho Park was suing his former Dodger teammate Chad Kreuter in Los Angeles Superior Court, in which he claimed Kreuter breached repayment of a $460,000 promissory note issued in October 2005.

===2010: New York Yankees &amp; Pittsburgh Pirates===

On February 28, 2010, Park signed a one-year contract worth $1.2 million with $300,000 incentives with the New York Yankees. Chan Ho Park decided to play for the Yankees after rejecting an offer of around $3 million per year from the Philadelphia Phillies.

Park got off to a poor start in 2010. In a widely circulated YouTube clip, he blamed his poor performance in one April appearance on a case of diarrhea. After struggling with a 5.60 ERA., Park was designated for assignment on July 31, 2010. On August 4, 2010, Park was claimed off waivers by the Pittsburgh Pirates.
On October 1, Park recorded a record for most wins by an Asian-born pitcher in MLB history, tossing three scoreless innings for his 124th career victory. He passed Hideo Nomo for the most ever by an Asian-born pitcher. He became a free agent at the end of the season.

===2011: Orix Buffaloes===
On December 20, 2010, Park signed one-year deal with the Orix Buffaloes of Nippon Professional Baseball for the 2011 season.

===2012: Hanwha Eagles===
On November 24, 2011, Park signed one-year deal with the Hanwha Eagles of the KBO League for the 2012 season.

On December 20, 2011, Park announced that he would guarantee a minimum of $35.5k (₩40 million) of his salary to fund the development of amateur baseball in South Korea. His contract bonus has potential earnings at up to $550,000 (₩600 million) in which Park would donate 100% of this salary to fund efforts to build amateur baseball with youth in the country. Park posted a record of 5–10 with a 5.06 ERA with the Eagles.

He announced his retirement from baseball on November 30, 2012. Park had a record of 124–98 in the Major Leagues with the Dodgers, Rangers, Padres, Mets, Phillies, Yankees, and Pirates.

===World Baseball Classic===
Between the 2005 season and the season, Park represented South Korea in the World Baseball Classic. In the Asia Round games against Taiwan and Japan, Park made appearances as a closing pitcher, shutting out the opposing lineups. He made another appearance as a closer in the semifinal game against Mexico, in which he again shut out his opposing hitters. His performance made San Diego Padres&#x27; manager Bruce Bochy believe that Park can be used as an effective reliever as well as a starter. Park later said that Padres&#x27; closer Trevor Hoffman taught him how to focus in a relief situation. With his shutout performance in 10 innings and three saves, Korea finished the World Baseball Classic in third place and Park was selected to the WBC All-Star team along with his teammate Lee Seung-yeop and Team Korea&#x27;s captain Lee Jong-beom.

==Pitching style==
In his prime, Chan Ho was essentially a power pitcher, his biggest weapon being a four-seam fastball sitting in mid-90s (topped out at 100 mph). Mixed with a two-seam fastball, a slider, a curveball, and a changeup, he had five consecutive seasons of 10+ wins with the Dodgers. Being a power pitcher, however, he often experienced control problems, particularly early in the game. He got many strikeouts, yet also allowed many bases on balls and hit batters that contributed to his lower than average strikeout-walk ratio of less than 2. This prevented him from achieving low ERAs (he only had one top-10 season in ERA and that was his career best in 2000 of 3.27 which was seventh in the NL while playing in pitcher-friendly Dodger Stadium). He was also a flyball-pitcher that benefited a lot from spacious Dodger Stadium outfield; however his style often backfired later when he played for other teams. After several unsuccessful seasons with Rangers, Padres, and Mets, he added a two-seam fastball learned from Orel Hershiser. Fox play-by-play announcer Matt Vasgersian once said about Park&#x27;s two-seam fastball, &quot;You can only see a two-seamer like that in PlayStation 2.&quot; In his career in Philadelphia he also used a cutter and a sinker, learned from Kevin Brown. Park&#x27;s 2008 comeback season was marked with a return to complete health for the first time in years, allowing him to combine his crafty veteran style with a renewed ability to pitch effective fastballs in low to mid-90s mph.

==Personal life==
Park married Korean-Japanese socialite Ri-hye Park on November 29, 2005. An ethnic Korean, she grew up in Japan and went to culinary school in New York. She is publicly known as a semi-professional chef, writer and the only daughter of Japan&#x27;s 76th richest man according to &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;. In spring 2009, Ri-hye released a best-selling cookbook in South Korea whose proceeds went to children&#x27;s charities on behalf of the Chan Ho Park Dream Foundation. Park and his wife have three daughters.

In 2020, Park made a cameo appearance as himself in two episodes of the Korean television drama &quot;Start-Up&quot;.

In 2021, Park played in two golf tournaments on the Korean Tour.

<doc id="666662" wikidata="Q493616" url="?curid=666662" title="Royal Clipper">
<text>Royal Clipper is a steel-hulled five-masted fully rigged tall ship used as a cruise ship. She was redesigned by Robert McFarlane of McFarlane ShipDesign, for Star Clippers Ltd. of Sweden, the same designer behind the cruise company&#x27;s first two vessels. This third one was built using an existing steel hull designed by Zygmunt Choreń that was modified by the Gdańsk Shipyard, where was added to its length.

Originally built by Polish communist authorities as &quot;Gwarek&quot; she was intended as a floating vacation home for miners . She was sold because of financial problems. The Merwede shipyard completed the ship&#x27;s interior in July 2000, whilst visiting the Pool of London, for its pre-launch to the travel industry. The renovations included frescography murals by Rainer Maria Latzke completing the ship&#x27;s Mediterranean interior. Her design was based on &quot;Preussen&quot;, a famous German five-mast Flying P-Liner windjammer built in 1902.

Star Clippers claims that she is the largest &quot;true sailing ship&quot; built since &quot;Preussen&quot;. She is listed in &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the largest square-rigged ship in service, with of sail. Her sails can be handled with a crew as small as twenty using powered controls.

&quot;Royal Clipper&quot; cruises the Mediterranean during the summer. During the winter she offers Caribbean trips through the southern parts of the Lesser Antilles area. Because of her size, she can visit smaller ports that larger (motor) cruise ships can&#x27;t reach. Transatlantic crossings are available between seasons.

<doc id="666667" wikidata="Q7568102" url="?curid=666667" title="South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission">
<text>The Pacific Islands Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC) was an inter-governmental regional organisation dedicated to providing services to promote sustainable development in the countries it serves. In 2010, its functions had been transferred to the Pacific Community (SPC) and the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP), thus ending SOPAC as a separate entity. Today, SOPAC is a division of the SPC with its main office in Suva, Fiji.

==History==
SOPAC was created by the conclusion of a 1990 multilateral treaty known as the Agreement establishing the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission. The treaty was concluded and signed on 10 October 1990 in Tarawa, Kiribati. It was signed by representatives of the governments of Australia, Cook Islands, Fiji, Guam, Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and Western Samoa.

Since SOPAC&#x27;s foundation, American Samoa, France, French Polynesia, Nauru, New Caledonia, Niue, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Pitcairn Islands, Tokelau, United States, and Wallis and Futuna have accepted the Agreement and thereby joined SOPAC.

==Activity==
SOPAC focuses on assisting SPC members in three key program areas, Ocean and Islands, Community Lifelines and Community Risk.
*Ocean and Islands is focused on research, development and management of non-living resources in ocean and island systems addressing issues relating to seabed resources, energy, maritime boundary delimitation, and monitoring of ocean processes.
*Community Lifelines is a diversified program that strengthens national capacities in energy, water and sanitation, information and communications.
*Community Risk is a comprehensive program aimed at reduction of community vulnerability through improved hazard assessment and risk management.

Benefits accrue to SPC members directly through provision of basic geological knowledge and indirectly, through improvements in land and ocean use, leading to improved health through water and sanitation provision, wealth generation through the development of mineral resources, hazard and disaster management and sustainable development by taking into account the geo-environmental impacts of development.

Any island member can request assistance from SOPAC which is funded by member-country contributions and supported by the following donors: Australia, Fiji, Canada, France, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, the Office of US Foreign Disaster Assistance, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth Secretariat, the European Union, and certain UN agencies.

== Major projects ==
; Environmental Vulnerability Index : SOPAC has contributed to the development of EVI to provide a new global indicator related to environmental issues.

; Reducing Vulnerabilities in Pacific ACP states : This project, based on three components, Water, Risks, and Aggregate, is also providing assistance in Bathymetry mapping, Remote sensing, Geographic Information Systems and the installation of open source web based map servers (Geospatial Content Management System) for fourteen Pacific Islands Countries.

<text>The Smolny Institute () is a Palladian edifice in Saint Petersburg that has played a major part in the history of Russia, notably as a center of women&#x27;s education, and the headquarters of the Bolsheviks during the early stages of the October Revolution.

==History==

The building was commissioned from Giacomo Quarenghi by the Society for Education of Noble Maidens and constructed in 1806–08 to house the Smolny Institute of Noble Maidens, established at the urging of Ivan Betskoy and in accordance with a decree of Catherine II (the Great) in 1764, borrowing its name from the nearby Smolny Convent. The establishment of the institute was a significant step in making education available for females in Russia: &quot;The provision of formal education for women began only in 1764 and 1765, when Catherine II established first the Smolny Institute for girls of the nobility in Saint Petersburg and then the Novodevichii Institute for the daughters of commoners.&quot;
The Smolny was Russia&#x27;s first educational establishment for women and continued to function under the personal patronage of the Russian Empress until just before the 1917 revolution. A parterre garden and iron-work grille around the institute date from the early 19th century.

Smolny Institute got its name from being close to the Smolny Convent that was built on the place where a resin plant had once been (&quot;smola&quot; is Russian for &quot;resin&quot;).
In 1917, Vladimir Lenin chose the building as Bolshevik headquarters immediately before and during the October Revolution. It was Lenin&#x27;s residence for several months, until the national government was moved to the Moscow Kremlin in March 1918. After that, the Smolny became the headquarters of the local Communist Party apparat, effectively the city hall. In 1927, a monument to Lenin was erected in front of the building, designed by the sculptor Vasily Kozlov and the architects Vladimir Shchuko and Vladimir Gelfreikh. The Smolny Institute was also the site of Sergei Kirov&#x27;s assassination in 1934.

After 1991, the Smolny was used as the seat of the city mayor (governor after 1996) and city administration of Saint Petersburg. Vladimir Putin worked there from 1991 to 1997 in the administration of Anatoly Sobchak.

Today, this historic building is the official residence of the governor of Saint Petersburg and also houses a museum dedicated to Lenin. Visitors to the museum can tour Lenin&#x27;s office and living rooms and see the assembly hall where the victory of the October revolution was proclaimed in 1917.

During the Finnish Civil War, the house in Helsinki which served as headquarters of the pro-Bolshevik Red Guard got nicknamed ″Smolna″, after the above Bolshevik headquarters in Saint Petersburg. The nickname stuck even after the defeat of the Red Guard, and the building was still so named when used by the victorious anti-Communist Finns.

<doc id="666680" wikidata="Q1408232" url="?curid=666680" title="Moderates (Italy)">
<text>The Moderates () are a centrist political party in Italy, active mainly in Piedmont, but also in Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Campania and Sicily. The party, whose leader is Giacomo Portas, is associated with the centrist party Italia Viva.

==History==
The party was launched in January 2006 by Portas, a former member of Forza Italia (FI), and was joined by four regional councillors: Giuliano Manolino (ex-FI), Giovanni Pizzale (ex-IdV), Mauro Laus (ex-DS) and Graziella Valloggia (ex-PRC).

In the 2006 municipal election in Turin the party scored 4.0%, in 2007 it won 3.0% in Cuneo, 7.8% in Grugliasco and 10.0% in Moncalieri, in 2008 it scored 5.6% in Ivrea and 5.9% in Orbassano.

In the 2008 general election Portas was elected to the Chamber of Deputies as an independent from the list of the Democratic Party in the &quot;Piedmont 1&quot; constituency, marking the party&#x27;s entry in national politics.

In 2009 provincial elections the party won 2.7% in the Province of Turin, 2.1% in Alessandria, 1.7% in Cuneo and 0.8% in Novara, and in that year municipal elections it obtained 10.4% in Nichelino and 6.7% in Piossasco.

In the 2010 regional election the Moderates won 3.1% of the vote regionally and 4.1% in the Province of Turin, where Michele Dell&#x27;Utri was elected regional councillor. After the election, Giovanni Maria Ferraris was appointed regional minister.

In the 2011 Turin municipal election the party garnered a sweeping 9.1% and four councillors, being crucial for the election of Democrat Piero Fassino as mayor.

In the 2012 municipal elections the party won 6.5% in Alessandria, 4.6% in Asti, 6.8% in Cuneo, and 11.9% in Grugliasco. Lists with a similar name and symbol appeared also outside Piedmont, most notably in Piacenza, where &quot;Moderates for Dosi&quot; won 13.4% of the vote.

The party contested the 2013 general election as part of the PD-led centre-left coalition Italy. Common Good and Portas was re-elected to the Chamber.

In the 2014 regional election the party obtained 2.5% of the vote and two councillors.

In 2015 Michelino Davico, a senator from Cuneo elected with Lega Nord, joined the party, which was thus represented in both houses of the Italian Parliament.

In 2016 the party formed a federative pact with Civic Choice (SC) and sub-group within the Mixed Group of the Chamber of Deputies with three deputies (Marco Di Lello, S&amp;D–PD; Lello Di Gioia, S&amp;D–PD; Aniello Formisano, IdV), but not its leader Portars, who remained in the group of the PD. In the 2016 local elections the Moderates won 5.9% in Turin, 10.0% in Pinerolo and 4.8% in Nichelino, and, outside Piedmont, no remarkable results (including a mere 0.9% in Naples).

In the 2017 local elections the party obtained 3.8% in Alessandria, 4.6% in Cuneo, and 7.4% in Chivasso.

The Moderates contested the 2018 general election as part of the centre-left coalition and Portas was elected in the PD list. 

In 2019 the Moderates ended their association with the Democratic Party and affiliated to Italia Viva, the new centrist party founded by former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. Portas also left the PD group in the Chamber of Deputies and joined the IV group. 

The party competed in the 2020 Campania regional election in support of the candidate Vincenzo De Luca, getting 3.6% of the vote and 2 seats.

The party originally planned to contest the 2022 general election as a component of the Democratic Party – Democratic and Progressive Italy list.

<doc id="666685" wikidata="Q4970460" url="?curid=666685" title="Stack Attack">
<text>Stack Attack was the game for the 2003 FIRST Robotics Competition. Two teams of two robots compete by moving large Sterilite bins into their zones and arranging them into stacks.

==Layout==
At the beginning of the match, each team is given 4 bins, which they may arrange as they see fit. Each of these bins are marked with a retroreflective tape that is highly visible to the infrared sensors included in the kit of parts. In the center of the field on top of the ramp is a large stack of 29 bins.

==Object==
The object of this game is for each two player alliance to rack up more points than the other team. Scoring is one point for every bin in an alliance&#x27;s scoring zone, multiplied by the height of their highest stack. Each robot on the top of the ramp at the end of the match adds 25 points to an alliance&#x27;s score. Bins that are supported by a robot do not count towards the final score.

==Gameplay==
===Human Player===
The Human player period is 10 seconds at the start of the match where one designated person from each team may walk onto the field and pass or receive one or more of their four bins to their allied team&#x27;s human player. This allowed teams to create stacks higher than the initial 4-high stacks. The human players needed to return to a pressure-sensitive pad before their robot was activated.

===Autonomous===
The autonomous period was 15 seconds long in Stack Attack. During the autonomous period, teams could use infrared sensors to hunt the opposing team&#x27;s stacks, use the same sensors to follow white tape or use dead reckoning to navigate to the center stacks.

===Human-controlled===
The human controlled phase began immediately after the autonomous period. During this phase, robots would attempt to amass the most bins on their side, while preventing the opposing teams from getting bins onto their scoring area and knocking down opposing stacks. Robots that were capable of stacking would use this time to begin building and protecting a stack of bins.

==Strategies==

===Autonomous===
The most successful strategy in autonomous mode was to get the robot to run through the centre stack and push as many bins as possible onto that robot&#x27;s scoring end. Since it was very difficult to move bins from one end of the field to the other, once most of the centre bins landed in one end, often that team would win. Teams could also try to seek out and knock over the stacks of bins that the human players had placed at the start of the match.

===Human Controlled Game===
Often the main game was a chaotic period where teams would try and clear out their own zone while attempting to keep as many bins on their scoring section as possible. Robots that were capable of stacking would usually protect their stack for the entire match, then release it just as the match ended.

<doc id="666689" wikidata="Q5451000" url="?curid=666689" title="Finvarra">
<text>Finvarra, also called Finvara, Finn Bheara, Finbeara or Fionnbharr, is the king of the Daoine Sidhe of western Ireland in Irish folklore. In some legends, he is also the ruler of the dead. Finvarra is a benevolent figure, associated with horses, who ensures good harvests and rewards mortals with riches.

== Location ==
According to legend, Finvarra lives beneath Cnoc Meadha or Knockma, a hill near Tuam in County Galway; this hill was traditionally associated with the fairies. There is a cairn on the hill, marked as &quot;Finvarra&#x27;s castle&quot; on at least one map.

Dáithí Ó hÓgáin suggests that Finvarra&#x27;s name comes from &quot;findbharr&quot;, “fair top,” originally referring to the top of the hill or a cairn there, and was later repurposed as the name of a deity who lived there.

== Mythology ==
Fionnbharr plays a role in the Fenian Cycle and in bardic poetry, where he is one of the Tuatha Dé Danann. Findbharr of Cnoc Meadha is mentioned in the &quot;Agallamh na Seanoach&quot; (12th century). In &quot;Altram Tighe Dá Mheadar&quot; (The Fosterage of the House of the Two Drinking Vessels), Finnbarr Meadha is one of the Dé Dananns, who becomes ruler of the hill of Meadha after they are driven underground by the Milesians. He has a violent argument with his brother Oengus after insulting one of Oengus&#x27;s foster-daughters. He has seventeen sons according to the &quot;Acallam na Senórach&quot;, and in one poem it is said that Manannán gave him a wonderful harp named Brégadh Banntrachta.

In the 15th-century &quot;Feis Tighe Chondin&quot; (The Feast of the House of Conán), Fionnbharr of Magh Feabhail is king of the &quot;Tuatha Dedanans&quot; and leads an army against Fionn mac Cumhaill and the Fenians only to fall in battle at the hands of Goll.

== Folk belief ==
Legends of Finvarra and his connection with Knockma survived into later folklore, where he was considered the king of the fairies, particularly of Connacht. Local beliefs held that the doings of the fairies influenced the local crops. Whenever Finvarra lived in the hill it was a good year for the country, and when he was absent, it would be a bad year. His battles and hurling matches affected the health of the crops; when his people defeated the fairies of other provinces, the crops of Connacht bloomed. There was a rivalry between the Munster fairy king and Finvarra. Famine was attributed to disturbances in the fairy world, and one folk informant claimed to have seen the &quot;good people&quot; fighting in the sky over Knock Ma. According to many tales, Finvarra would invite humans into his underground palace for feasts.

Finvarra has a beautiful queen named Onagh or Una, or other versions, Nuala. However, he often steals away human women as lovers. In the story of &quot;Ethna the Bride,&quot; Finvarra kidnaps Ethna, the loveliest woman in Ireland. Her husband, Denis Kirwan is able to win her back by digging into the fairy hill of Knockma and salting the earth. Ethna returns but falls into a deep sleep since Finvarra has kept her soul. Her husband revives her by removing a girdle and fairy pin that she had been dressed in by the fairies. With Finvarra&#x27;s role as a ruler of the dead, this story bears a resemblance to the ballad of Sir Orfeo. It also has similarities to the story of Midir and Étaín.

In another story, a man who foolishly stays out late on Halloween is swept along with a group of fairies on their way to a fair. He meets their king Finvarra and his wife, and realizes that the people around him are spirits of the dead. They force him to dance until he passes out, and he wakes up the next morning in a stone circle, covered in bruises.

Finnbheara can also be benevolent in folk legends, such as one where he heals a woman. He is strongly associated with horses. In one story, he goes to a blacksmith to have his three-legged horse shod, and the next day a pound note flies to the blacksmith on the wind. In another tradition, Finvar watched over the Kirwan family who lived in Castle Hackett near Knockma. Finvar and his people would carouse and drink in the Castle cellars, but left the cellars always well-stocked and the wine improved. They would also exercise the race-horses late at night, granting them speed and good fortune in the races. In another story, a member of the Hacket family was unable to find a good jockey for a race, so Finnbheara himself appeared, rode the horse, and disappeared after winning the race.

<text>Bengt Lidner (March 16, 1757 – January 4, 1793) was a Swedish poet, born in Gothenburg. His opera &quot;Medea&quot; was translated to English and played in England during his lifetime, but wasn&#x27;t played in Sweden until 2004.

His father died when he was 3, his mother when he was 14. In 1774, at age 17, he started studies at Lund University and produced two dissertations within two years, but was expelled just before presenting the second one. In 1776 he joined a ship of the Swedish East India Company from Gothenburg to China, but fled in Cape Town in April and in September he enlisted as a student of the University of Greifswald, which then was situated in Swedish Pomerania. There he wrote a dissertation on the justification of the American declaration of independence, but was told this subject was too sensitive, because of Sweden&#x27;s diplomatic relation with Great Britain.

In 1779 he moved to Stockholm, where he started a career in literature. Despite a questionable reputation, he received a royal scholarship in 1780 and went to Göttingen in Germany, where he studied and lived beyond his means. From Göttingen he went to Paris, and returned to Stockholm in 1782. In 1787 he went to Finland and in 1788 married Eva Jacquette Hastfer, with whom he moved back to Stockholm the next year. In 1793 he died in poverty. The Swedish Academy in 1860 put a stone on his grave on the cemetery of Church of Adolf Fredrik in Stockholm.

Lidner&#x27;s collected works have appeared (in Swedish) in many editions, most recently in the text critical edition of Svenska Vitterhetssamfundet in four volumes, 1930-1992.

<text>Antonio Cruz (born April 23, 1977), known professionally as Tony Sunshine, is an American R&amp;B singer of Puerto Rican descent. He is best known as a member of Fat Joe&#x27;s hip hop group Terror Squad in the late 1990s, and notably guest featured on group cohort Big Pun&#x27;s 2000 single, &quot;100%&quot; and has also appeared on Cuban Link&#x27;s single &quot;Still Telling Lies&quot;. His guest appearance alongside Armageddon on Fat Joe&#x27;s 2003 single, &quot;All I Need&quot; peaked at number 54 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while his guest appearance on Lumidee&#x27;s 2007 cover &quot;She&#x27;s Like the Wind&quot; peaked at number 43 on the chart. He was led by Joe to sign with Jive Records to release his 2004 debut single &quot;Oh My God&quot; (featuring Diddy and Dirtbag), which failed to chart.

==Early life==
Raised in the Bronx, Cruz was discovered by fellow Bronx native Fat Joe at the age of thirteen, who attempted to secure a recording contract for the teen. Cruz then adopted the name Tony Sunshine, and ultimately became a member of Terror Squad. Fat Joe, the group&#x27;s leader, said he respected and understood Cruz&#x27;s talent.

==Career==
Cruz performed vocals for Terror Squad cohort Big Pun, on his songs &quot;100%&quot;, &quot;Laughin at You&quot;, and &quot;My Dick&quot;. He has also appeared on Fat Joe&#x27;s songs &quot;TS Piece&quot; and &quot;All I Need&quot;. Terror Squad&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released in 1999, on which Cruz made numerous appearances. Cruz has also appeared on Cuban Link&#x27;s 24K album, contributing vocals to the tracks &quot;Freak Out&quot;, &quot;Still Telling Lies&quot;, &quot;Hey Mama&quot;, and &quot;Taste of Pastry&quot;.

Cruz signed with Jive Records to release his 2004 single &quot;Oh My God&quot;, which failed to chart. Fat Joe was then able to finalize a record deal for Cruz in 2005 with Epic and Sony BMG, although he was dropped in May of the following year and subsequently signed to Urban Box Office. In November 2006, the label collapsed and left Cruz as an independent artist. In 2007, he guest featured on fellow New York singer Lumidee&#x27;s single, &quot;She&#x27;s Like the Wind&quot;. As well as the English version, a Spanglish version was also recorded.

In 2010, he independently released the single &quot;Say Hey&quot; (featuring Swizz Beatz) in July of that year. In 2015, Cruz released the mixtape &quot;No Filter&quot;. In 2016, Cruz reunited with Fat Joe and Terror Squad, although this resulted in no major releases.

<text>A pedigree chart is a diagram that shows the occurrence of certain traits through different generations of a family, most commonly for humans, show dogs, and race horses.

==Definition==
The word pedigree is a corruption of the Anglo-Norman French &quot;pé de grue&quot; or &quot;crane&#x27;s foot&quot;, either because the typical lines and split lines (each split leading to different offspring of the one parent line) resemble the thin leg and foot of a crane or because such a mark was used to denote succession in pedigree charts.

A pedigree results in the presentation of family information in the form of an easily readable chart. It can be simply called a &quot;family tree&quot;. Pedigrees use a standardized set of symbols, squares represent males and circles represent females. Pedigree construction is a family history, and details about an earlier generation may be uncertain as memories fade. If the sex of the person is unknown, a diamond is used. Someone with the phenotype (trait) in question is represented by a filled-in (darker) symbol. Heterozygotes, when identifiable, are indicated by a shaded dot inside a symbol or a half-filled symbol.

Relationships in a pedigree are shown as a series of lines. A horizontal line connects parents and a vertical line leads to their offspring. The offspring are connected by a horizontal sibship line and listed in birth order from left to right. If the offspring are twins then they will be connected by a triangle. If an offspring dies then its symbol will be crossed by a line. If the offspring is stillborn or aborted, it is represented by a small triangle.

Each generation is identified by a Roman numeral (I, II, III, and so on), and each individual within the same generation is identified by an Arabic numeral (1, 2, 3, and so on). Analysis of the pedigree using the principles of Mendelian inheritance can determine whether a trait has a dominant or recessive pattern of inheritance. Pedigrees are often constructed after a family member afflicted with a genetic disorder has been identified. This individual, known as the proband, is indicated on the pedigree by an arrow. These changes may occur yearly or monthly.

==In human use==
In England and Wales pedigrees are officially recorded in the College of Arms, which has records going back to the Middle Ages, including pedigrees collected during roving inquiries by its heralds during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The purpose of these heraldic visitations was to register and regulate the use of coats of arms. Those who claimed the right to bear arms had to provide proof either of a grant of arms to them by the College, or of descent from an ancestor entitled to arms. It was for this reason that pedigrees were recorded by the visitations. Pedigrees continue to be registered at the College of Arms and kept up to date on a voluntary basis but are not accessible to the general public without payment of a fee.

More visible, therefore, are the pedigrees recorded in published works, such as Burke&#x27;s Peerage and Burke&#x27;s Landed Gentry in the United Kingdom and, in continental Europe by the Almanach de Gotha.

A pedigree may be used to establish the probability of a child having a particular disorder or condition. It may be used to discover where the genes in question are located (x, y, or autosome chromosome), and to determine whether a trait is dominant or recessive. When a pedigree shows a condition appearing in a 50:50 ratio between men and women, it is considered autosomal. When the condition predominantly affects males in the pedigree, it is considered x-linked.

Some examples of dominant traits include male baldness, astigmatism, and dwarfism. Some examples of recessive traits include small eyes, little body hair, and tall stature.

==In animal husbandry==

In the practice of selective breeding of animals, particularly in animal fancy and livestock, including horses, pedigree charts are used to track the ancestry of animals and assist in the planning of suitable breeding programs to enhance desirable traits. Breed registries are formed and are dedicated to the accurate tracking of pedigrees and maintaining accurate records of birth, death, and identifying characteristics of each registered animal.

<text>The Pasyón () is a Philippine epic narrative of the life of Jesus Christ, focused on his Passion, Death, and Resurrection. In stanzas of five lines of eight syllables each, the standard elements of epic poetry are interwoven with a colourful, dramatic theme.

The uninterrupted chanting or &quot;pabasa&quot; (“reading”) of the entire book from start to end is a popular Filipino Catholic devotion during the Lenten season, particularly during Holy Week.

In 2011, the &quot;Pabasa&quot; was cited by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts as one of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of the Philippines under the Performing Arts category that the government may nominate for inclusion in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.

== History ==
The text is an adaptation of the pre-Hispanic Filipino art of chanting epic poems as a part of oral tradition. After Christianity was introduced by the Spaniards in the 16th century, the Passion cycle was adapted into this native narrative form.

The indigenous form of the &quot;Pasyón&quot; was first written down by Gaspar Aquino de Belén in &quot;Ang Mahal na Pasión ni Jesu Christong Panginoon Natin na Tola&quot; (modern orthography: “&quot;Ang Mahál na Pasyón ni Hesukristong Panginoón Natin na Tulà”&quot;, &quot;The Sacred Passion of Jesus Christ, Our Lord, Which is a Poem&quot;), written in 1703 and approved in 1704.

An 1852 recension by Aniceto de Merced, &quot;El libro de la vida&quot; (&quot;The Book of the Life [of Jesus]&quot;) did not gain popularity with the masses.

===&quot;Pasyóng Genesís&quot;===
The most popular Tagalog version of the &quot;Pasyón&quot; today is the &quot;Casaysayan nang Pasiong Mahal ni Hesucristong Panginoon Natin na Sucat Ipag-alab nang Puso nang Sinomang Babasa&quot; (modern orthography: “&quot;Kasaysayan ng Pasyóng Mahál ni Hesukristong Panginoón Natin na Sukat Ipág-alab ng Pusò ng Sínumang Babasa&quot;”, &quot;The Story of the Passion of Jesus Christ, Our Lord, which Rightly Shall Ignite the Heart of Whosoever Readeth&quot;).

This version is also called the “&quot;Pasyóng Genesís”&quot; as the Genesis creation narrative immediately follows the prayer to the Blessed Virgin Mary and Trinitarian catechesis, and precedes the main section concerning the Life of Christ. Another name for this text is “&quot;Pasyóng Pilapil”&quot; after the foreword by &quot;[Rev.]&quot; Dr. Mariano Pilapil, found in the 1814 edition. The book&#x27;s title page describes it as being commissioned by former Archbishop of Manila José Seguí, O.S.A., and former Augustinian provincial Fr Manuel Grijalvo, O.S.A., with corrections to the Latin terms and phrases done by a certain Fr Amador W. Cruz.

A widely-circulated reprint of the &quot;Pasyóng Genesís&quot; is the 1949 edition, whose title begins with “&quot;Awit at Salaysay...”&quot; (&quot;Song and Narrative&quot;) instead of “&quot;Casaysayan”,&quot; and was published by Ignacio Luna and Sons, Co. in Manila.

== Devotional use ==

The &quot;Pasyón&quot; is normally heard during Holy Week in the Philippines, where its recitation is known as the &quot;pabása&quot; (&quot;reading&quot;). The rite can span one to several days, extending no later than Black Saturday. It is often ended on Good Friday at noon or before 3:00 PM PST (UTC+8) – the “ninth hour” of Jesus&#x27; death on the Cross according to the Gospels.

Readers chant the &quot;Pasyón&quot; from beginning to end uninterrupted; this non-stop recitation is done by devotees chanting in shifts. The chanters usually perform the rite as a &quot;panatà&quot; (&quot;vow&quot;), or votive offering in request, or as an &quot;ex voto&quot; in thanksgiving. Devotees are frequently older women and some men, but in recent years more younger Filipinos have shown interest in the custom.

The &quot;Pasyón&quot; is almost always chanted while facing the family’s permanent house altar, or a temporary altar decorated with religious icons, particularly those related to the suffering and death of Christ. Temporary altars may be built inside or outside the house, with outdoor venues decked with palm leaf walls. The &quot;pabasa&quot; may also be performed at a local &quot;visita&quot;/&quot;kapilya&quot; (chapel of ease) or some other community space, and even along the streets.

As per Filipino etiquette, the host of the &quot;pabasa&quot; (often the master or lady of the house) is responsible for feeding the shifts of chanters as well as other guests.

=== Musical setting ===
There are various traditional melodies or &quot;tono&quot; for the &quot;Pasyón&quot; that have been passed down through the centuries. Recent innovations include setting the epic to modern ballads, pop music, and contemporary hymns; in some places a rap or hip hop variant is used especially by youths, though in 2012 the practice of &quot;rap &quot;pabasa&quot;&quot; was banned in Valenzuela as it was deemed irreverent and against the solemnity of the occasion. Pedro Quitorio III, spokesman for the Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference of the Philippines, saw nothing wrong with the youths&#x27; take on the &quot;Pasyón:&quot; “What is important is the intention. But there should be reverence because it’s also not good if it’s not solemn.”

Instrumental accompaniment to the &quot;Pabasa&quot; is not as popular nor uniform in practice as most devotees would chant &quot;a capella&quot;, using &quot;tonos&quot; from memory. If there is accompaniment, the guitar and electronic keyboard are commonly used.

<doc id="666697" wikidata="Q473227" url="?curid=666697" title="Cubic crystal system">
<text>In crystallography, the cubic (or isometric) crystal system is a crystal system where the unit cell is in the shape of a cube. This is one of the most common and simplest shapes found in crystals and minerals.

There are three main varieties of these crystals:
*Primitive cubic (abbreviated &quot;cP&quot; and alternatively called simple cubic)
*Body-centered cubic (abbreviated &quot;cI&quot; or bcc)
*Face-centered cubic (abbreviated &quot;cF&quot; or fcc)
Note: the term fcc is often used in synonym for the &quot;cubic close-packed&quot; or ccp structure occurring in metals. However, fcc stands for a face-centered cubic Bravais lattice, which is not necessarily close-packed when a motif is set onto the lattice points. E.g. the diamond and the zincblende lattices are fcc but not close-packed.
Each is subdivided into other variants listed below. Although the &quot;unit cells&quot; in these crystals are conventionally taken to be cubes, the primitive unit cells often are not.

==Bravais lattices==

The three Bravais latices in the cubic crystal system are:

The primitive cubic lattice (cP) consists of one lattice point on each corner of the cube; this means each simple cubic unit cell has in total one lattice point. Each atom at a lattice point is then shared equally between eight adjacent cubes, and the unit cell therefore contains in total one atom ( × 8).

The body-centered cubic lattice (cI) has one lattice point in the center of the unit cell in addition to the eight corner points. It has a net total of two lattice points per unit cell ( × 8 + 1).

The face-centered cubic lattice (cF) has lattice points on the faces of the cube, that each gives exactly one half contribution, in addition to the corner lattice points, giving a total of four lattice points per unit cell ( × 8 from the corners plus  × 6 from the faces).

The face-centered cubic lattice is closely related to the hexagonal close packed (hcp) system, where two systems differ only in the relative placements of their hexagonal layers. The [111] plane of a face-centered cubic lattice is a hexagonal grid.

Attempting to create a base-centered cubic lattice (i.e., putting an extra lattice point in the center of each horizontal face) results in a simple tetragonal Bravais lattice.

Coordination number (CN) is the number of nearest neighbors of a central atom in the structure. Each sphere in a cP lattice has coordination number 6, in a cI lattice 8, and in a cF lattice 12.

Atomic packing factor (APF) is the fraction of volume that is occupied by atoms. The cP lattice has an APF of about 0.524, the cI lattice an APF of about 0.680, and the cF lattice an APF of about 0.740.

==Crystal classes==

The &quot;isometric crystal system&quot; class names, point groups (in Schönflies notation, Hermann–Mauguin notation, orbifold, and Coxeter notation), type, examples, international tables for crystallography space group number, and space groups are listed in the table below. There are a total 36 cubic space groups.

Other terms for hexoctahedral are: normal class, , ditesseral central class, galena type.

==Single element structures==
As a rule, since atoms in a solid attract each other, the more tightly packed arrangements of atoms tend to be more common. (Loosely packed arrangements do occur, though, for example if the orbital hybridization demands certain bond angles.) Accordingly, the primitive cubic structure, with especially low atomic packing factor, is rare in nature, but is found in polonium. The &quot;bcc&quot; and &quot;fcc&quot;, with their higher densities, are both quite common in nature. Examples of &quot;bcc&quot; include iron, chromium, tungsten, and niobium. Examples of &quot;fcc&quot; include aluminium, copper, gold and silver.

Another important cubic crystal structure is the diamond cubic structure, which can appear in carbon, silicon, germanium, and tin. Unlike fcc and bcc, this structure is not a lattice, since it contains multiple atoms in its primitive cell. Other cubic elemental structures include the A15 structure found in tungsten, and the extremely complicated structure of manganese.

==Multi-element structures==
Compounds that consist of more than one element (e.g. binary compounds) often have crystal structures based on the cubic crystal system. Some of the more common ones are listed here. These structures can be viewed as two or more interpenetrating sublattices where each sublattice occupies the interstitial sites of the others.

===Caesium chloride structure===

One structure is the &quot;interpenetrating primitive cubic&quot; structure, also called a &quot;caesium chloride&quot; or B2 structure. This structure is often confused for a body-centered cubic structure because the arrangement of atoms is the same. However, the caesium chloride structure has a basis composed of two different atomic species. In a body-centered cubic structure, there would be translational symmetry along the [111] direction. In the caesium chloride structure, translation along the [111] direction results in a change of species. The structure can also be thought of as two separate simple cubic structures, one of each species, that are superimposed within each other. The corner of the chloride cube is the center of the caesium cube, and vice versa. 
It works the same way for the NaCl structure described in the next section.  If you take out the Cl atoms, the leftover Na atoms still form an FCC structure, not a simple cubic structure.

In the unit cell of CsCl, each ion is at the center of a cube of ions of the opposite kind, so the coordination number is eight. The central cation is coordinated to 8 anions on the corners of a cube as shown, and similarly, the central anion is coordinated to 8 cations on the corners of a cube. Alternately, one could view this lattice as a simple cubic structure with a secondary atom in its cubic void.

In addition to caesium chloride itself, the structure also appears in certain other alkali halides when prepared at low temperatures or high pressures. Generally, this structure is more likely to be formed from two elements whose ions are of roughly the same size (for example, ionic radius of Cs+ = 167 pm, and Cl− = 181 pm).

The space group of the caesium chloride (CsCl) structure is called Pmm (in Hermann–Mauguin notation), or &quot;221&quot; (in the International Tables for Crystallography). The Strukturbericht designation is &quot;B2&quot;.

There are nearly a hundred rare earth intermetallic compounds that crystallize in the CsCl structure, including many binary compounds of rare earths with magnesium, and with elements in groups 11, 12, and 13. Other compounds showing caesium chloride like structure are CsBr, CsI, high-temperature RbCl, AlCo, AgZn, BeCu, MgCe, RuAl and SrTl.

===Rock-salt structure===

The space group of the rock-salt or halite (sodium chloride) structure is denoted as Fmm (in Hermann–Mauguin notation), or &quot;225&quot; (in the International Tables for Crystallography). The Strukturbericht designation is &quot;B1&quot;.

In the rock-salt structure, each of the two atom types forms a separate face-centered cubic lattice, with the two lattices interpenetrating so as to form a 3D checkerboard pattern. The rock-salt structure has octahedral coordination: Each atom&#x27;s nearest neighbors consist of six atoms of the opposite type, positioned like the six vertices of a regular octahedron. In sodium chloride there is a 1:1 ratio of sodium to chlorine atoms.  The structure can also be described as an FCC lattice of sodium with chlorine occupying each octahedral void or vice versa.

Examples of compounds with this structure include sodium chloride itself, along with almost all other alkali halides, and &quot;many divalent metal oxides, sulfides, selenides, and tellurides&quot;. According to the radius ratio rule, this structure is more likely to be formed if the cation is somewhat smaller than the anion (a cation/anion radius ratio of 0.414 to 0.732).

The interatomic distance (distance between cation and anion, or half the unit cell length &quot;a&quot;) in some rock-salt-structure crystals are: 2.3 Å (2.3 × 10−10 m) for NaF, 2.8 Å for NaCl, and 3.2 Å for SnTe. Most of the alkali metal hydrides and halides have the rock salt structure, though a few have the caesium chloride structure instead.



Many transition metal monoxides also have the rock salt structure (TiO, VO, CrO, MnO, FeO, CoO, NiO, CdO). The early actinoid monocarbides also have this structure (ThC, PaC, UC, NpC, PuC).

===Fluorite structure===
Much like the rock salt structure, the fluorite structure (AB2) is also an Fmm structure but has 1:2 ratio of ions. The anti-fluorite structure is nearly identical, except the positions of the anions and cations are switched in the structure. They are designated Wyckoff positions 4a and 8c whereas the rock-salt structure positions are 4a and 4b.

===Zincblende structure===
The space group of the Zincblende structure is called F3m (in Hermann–Mauguin notation), or 216. The Strukturbericht designation is &quot;B3&quot;.

The Zincblende structure (also written &quot;zinc blende&quot;) is named after the mineral zincblende (sphalerite), one form of zinc sulfide (β-ZnS). As in the rock-salt structure, the two atom types form two interpenetrating face-centered cubic lattices. However, it differs from rock-salt structure in how the two lattices are positioned relative to one another. The zincblende structure has tetrahedral coordination: Each atom&#x27;s nearest neighbors consist of four atoms of the opposite type, positioned like the four vertices of a regular tetrahedron. In zinc sulfide the ratio of zinc to sulfur is 1:1. Altogether, the arrangement of atoms in zincblende structure is the same as diamond cubic structure, but with alternating types of atoms at the different lattice sites. The structure can also be described as an FCC lattice of zinc with sulfur atoms occupying half of the tetrahedral voids or vice versa.

Examples of compounds with this structure include zincblende itself, lead(II) nitrate, many compound semiconductors (such as gallium arsenide and cadmium telluride), and a wide array of other binary compounds. The boron group pnictogenides usually have a zincblende structure, though the nitrides are more common in the wurtzite structure, and their zincblende forms are less well known polymorphs.


This group is also known as the II-VI family of compounds, most of which can be made in both the zincblende (cubic) or wurtzite (hexagonal) form.
This group is also known as the III-V family of compounds.

===Heusler structure===

The Heusler structure, based on the structure of Cu2MnAl, is a common structure for ternary compounds involving transition metals. It has the space group Fmm (No. 225), and the Strukturbericht designation is L21. Together with the closely related half-Heusler and inverse-Huesler compounds, there are hundreds of examples.

===Iron monosilicide structure===

The space group of the iron monosilicide structure is P213 (No. 198), and the Strukturbericht designation is B20. This is a chiral structure, and is sometimes associated with helimagnetic properties. There are four atoms of each element for a total of eight atoms in the unit cell.

Examples occur among the transition metal silicides and germanides, as well as a few other compounds such as gallium palladide.

==Weaire–Phelan structure==

A Weaire–Phelan structure has Pmn (223) symmetry.

It has three orientations of stacked tetradecahedrons with pyritohedral cells in the gaps. It is found as a crystal structure in chemistry where it is usually known as a &quot;type I clathrate structure&quot;. Gas hydrates formed by methane, propane, and carbon dioxide at low temperatures have a structure in which water molecules lie at the nodes of the Weaire–Phelan structure and are hydrogen bonded together, and the larger gas molecules are trapped in the polyhedral cages.

<text>A vertical launching system (VLS) is an advanced system for holding and firing missiles on mobile naval platforms, such as surface ships and submarines. Each vertical launch system consists of a number of &quot;cells&quot;, which can hold one or more missiles ready for firing. Typically, each cell can hold a number of different types of missiles, allowing the ship flexibility to load the best set for any given mission. Further, when new missiles are developed, they are typically fitted to the existing vertical launch systems of that nation, allowing existing ships to use new types of missiles without expensive rework. When the command is given, the missile flies straight up far enough to clear the cell and the ship, then turns onto the desired course.

A VLS allows surface combatants to have a greater number of weapons ready for firing at any given time compared to older launching systems such as the Mark 13 single-arm and Mark 26 twin-arm launchers, which were fed from behind by a magazine below the main deck. In addition to greater firepower, VLS is much more damage tolerant and reliable than the previous systems and has a lower radar cross-section (RCS). The U.S. Navy now relies exclusively on VLS for its guided missile destroyers and cruisers.

The most widespread VLS in the world is the Mark 41, developed by the United States Navy. More than 11,000 Mark 41 VLS missile cells have been delivered, or are on order, for use on 186 ships across 19 ship classes, in 11 navies around the world. This system currently serves with the US Navy as well as the Australian, Danish, Dutch, German, Japanese, Norwegian, South Korean, Spanish, and Turkish navies, while others like the Greek Navy preferred the similar Mark 48 system.

The 3S-14 VLS was developed in Russia and is used in sea-based as well as land-based TEL systems such as the S-400 missile system.

The advanced Mark 57 VLS is used on the . The older Mark 13 and Mark 26 systems remain in service on ships that were sold to other countries such as Taiwan and Poland.

When installed on an SSN (nuclear-powered attack submarine), a VLS allows a greater number and variety of weapons to be deployed, compared with using only torpedo tubes.

==Launch type==

A vertical launch system can be either &quot;hot launch&quot;, where the missile ignites in the cell, or &quot;cold launch&quot;, where the missile is expelled by gas produced by a gas generator which is not part of the missile itself, and then the missile ignites. &quot;Cold&quot; means &quot;relatively&quot; cold compared with rocket engine exhaust. A hot launch system does not require an ejection mechanism but does require some way of disposing of the missile&#x27;s exhaust and heat as it departs the cell. If the missile ignites in a cell without an ejection mechanism, the cell must withstand the tremendous heat generated without igniting missiles in adjacent cells.

===Hot launch===
An advantage of a hot-launch system is that the missile propels itself out of the launching cell using its own engine, which eliminates the need for a separate system to eject the missile from the launching tube. This potentially makes a hot-launch system relatively light, small, and economical to develop and produce, particularly when designed around smaller missiles. A potential disadvantage is that a malfunctioning missile could destroy the launch tube. American surface-ship VLSs have missile cells arranged in a grid with one lid per cell and are &quot;hot launch&quot; systems. The engine ignites within the cell during the launch and so requires a way of venting rocket exhaust. France, Italy and Britain use a similar hot-launching Sylver system in PAAMS.

===Cold launch===
The advantage of the cold-launch system is in its safety: if a missile engine malfunctions during launch, the cold-launch system can eject the missile, reducing or eliminating the threat. For this reason, Russian VLSs are often designed with a slant so that a malfunctioning missile will land in the water instead of on the ship&#x27;s deck. As missile size grows, the benefits of ejection launching increase. Above a certain size, a missile booster cannot be safely ignited within the confines of a ship&#x27;s hull. Most modern ICBMs and SLBMs are cold-launched. Russia produces both grid systems and a revolver arrangement with more than one missile per lid for its cold launch system. Russia also uses a cold launch system for some of its vertical launch missile systems, e.g., the Tor missile system.

The UK&#x27;s Common Anti-Air Modular Missile (CAMM) family of missiles utilises a similar cold-launching system, referred to as &quot;soft-vertical-launch&quot;, and actively markets the advantages of the system. Soft-launch provides the missile with a reduce interception rate allowing for shorter ranged engagements, reduces the IR signature of the ship and the obscurant of visibility by rendering the ship in efflux for several minutes; and most notably, the lack of hot efflux and reduced stress on the ship&#x27;s structure allows for a much greater choice of launch systems, such as the lighter &quot;Mushroom Farm&quot; launcher whilst also still enabling installation into the heavier Mark 41 in a quad-pack or dual-packed configuration (4 or 2 missiles per cell) for a costly, but more space efficient option.

===Concentric canister launch===
Some warships of China&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy use a concentric canister launch (CCL) system that can launch using both hot and cold methods in the cell module, onboard the Type 052D destroyer and the Type 055 destroyer. The universal launch system is offered for export.

Older Chinese ships use single launch system: Type 052C destroyers use a cold launch system, while Type 054A frigates use a hot launch system.

==Other platforms==
Transporter erector launchers are wheeled or tracked land vehicles for the launch of surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles. In most systems the missiles are transported in a horizontal out-of-battery configuration: in order to fire, the vehicle must stop and the transport/launch tube must be raised to the vertical before firing.

BAE Systems has filed patents relating to the use of Vertical Launch missiles from modified passenger aircraft.

==Systems in use by states==
===NATO===
In 2021, the Centre for Military Studies published the total number of VLS cells in use with fourteen NATO navies. The results are displayed below.
Note: The above table does not include NATO navies which do not possess vertical launching systems, namely Albania, Croatia, Estonia, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania and Slovenia.

<text>Tanaga is a type of Philippine poetry, traditionally in the Tagalog language, consisting of four lines with seven syllables each. It can also have rhymes schemes like AABB and ABAB.

==Format==
The Tanaga consists of four lines with seven syllables each with the same rhyme at the end of each line --- that is to say a 7-7-7-7 Syllabic verse, with an AABB rhyme scheme.

=== Archaic orthography ===
&quot;Catitibay ca tolos&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;sacaling datnang agos!&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;aco’I momonting lomot&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;sa iyo,I popolopot.&quot;&lt;br&gt;

=== Modern orthography ===
&quot;Katitibay kang tulos&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Sakaling datnan ng agos!&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Ako&#x27;y mumunting lumot&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;sa iyo&#x27;y pupulupot.&quot;&lt;br&gt;

=== Translation ===
&quot;Oh be resilient you stake&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Should the waters be coming!&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;I shall cower as the moss&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;To you I shall be clinging.&quot;&lt;br&gt;

The above Tanaga is attributed to Friars Juan de Noceda and Pedro de Sanlucar by Vim Nadera, and quoted them as saying “Poesia muy alta en tagalo, compuesta de siete silabas, y cuatro versos, llena de metafora.” (16th century) (&quot;Poetry is quite high in Tagalog, composed of seven syllables, and four verses, full of metaphor.&quot;) 

Like the Japanese haiku, Tanagas traditionally are untitled. Most are handed down by oral history, and contain proverbial forms, moral lessons, and ethics.

A poetic form similar to the Tanaga is the Ambahan. Unlike the Ambahan whose length is indefinite, the Tanaga is a seven-syllable quatrain. Poets test their skills at rhyme, meter and metaphor through the Tanaga because is it rhymed and measured, while it exacts skillful use of words to create a puzzle that demands an answer.

It was a dying art form, but the Cultural Center of the Philippines and National Commission of the Arts is attempting to revivify it. Poetry groups, like the PinoyPoets, promote Filipino poetry in English; the vernacular are also advocating the spread of this art form.

==Modern form==
The modern Tanaga still uses the 7777 syllable count, but rhymes range from dual rhyme forms: AABB, ABAB, ABBA; to freestyle forms such as AAAB, BAAA, or ABCD. Modern writers may opt to give them titles.

<doc id="666708" wikidata="Q3182219" url="?curid=666708" title="Sir John Orde, 1st Baronet">
<text>Sir John Orde, 1st Baronet (22 December 1751 – 19 February 1824) was a British Royal Navy officer. The third son of John Orde, of Morpeth, Northumberland, and the brother of Thomas Orde-Powlett, 1st Baron Bolton, he is remembered as a professional enemy of Nelson. Orde&#x27;s quarrel was actually more with Lord St Vincent and he never attacked Nelson personally.

Orde joined the Royal Navy in 1766, gained the rank of rear-admiral in 1795, vice-admiral in 1799 and eventually Admiral of the Red. In 1805, despite being asked to strike his flag, he was made Admiral of the Blue and Admiral of the White in 1810.

As a vice admiral in 1805 he commanded a squadron of six ships of the line off Cadiz, in the flagship HMS &quot;Glory&quot;.

Orde served as the Governor of Dominica between 1783 and 1793 and was created 1st Baronet Orde, of Morpeth, co. Northumberland on 9 August 1790. From 1807 he served as Member of Parliament for Yarmouth.

==Career==
===American Revolutionary War===
Orde joined the Royal Navy in 1766 and was promoted to lieutenant in 1774. He served throughout the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), and was promoted to post captain on 19 May 1778, making him senior to Nelson by less than a month. Orde served as Governor of Dominica from 1783 until 1793 and on 9 August 1790 was made a baronet. He returned to naval service and was promoted rear admiral 1795.

===Relationships with Jervis and Nelson===
In early 1798, Orde was appointed to the Mediterranean fleet as third in command under John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent. In May 1798, acting on his own initiative but with the support of Lord Spencer, the First Lord of the Admiralty, St Vincent gave command of a special squadron to Nelson. As Nelson&#x27;s senior, Orde felt he had been unfairly passed over and complained to St Vincent who, annoyed at his subordinate&#x27;s questioning of his orders, relieved Orde and ordered him home. Orde requested that he be court-martialled in order that he might have the opportunity to clear his name. The Board refused.&lt;ref name=&quot;NC11/194&quot;&gt;&quot;The Naval Chronicle&quot; Vol. 11, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; Orde then requested that St Vincent be brought before a court-martial. Again, the Board refused.&lt;ref name=&quot;NC11/195&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Board did go so far as to censure Jervis for not having supported his subordinates. Orde, unhappy with the outcome, challenged the earl to a duel. The challenge became public knowledge and the king ordered Jervis to decline. Before the challenge was formally declined, however, Orde wrote to the Board to inform them that he had withdrawn it.&lt;ref name=&quot;NC11/197&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Neither side came out of the situation well. Had Nelson not won such an extraordinary victory at the Battle of the Nile, Jervis may have faced a court martial for not having supported Orde. Unfortunately for Orde, Nelson&#x27;s victory was so complete that any criticism of Nelson or Jervis fell on deaf ears. Nelson naturally took Jervis&#x27;s side and regarded Orde as a personal enemy but Orde maintained that it was the principle of the appointment he objected to, not the person who had been chosen.

Things became worse for Orde when St Vincent was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty. St Vincent now controlled appointments and Orde found himself left ashore. St Vincent left the Admiralty in 1804 and Orde was offered command of a newly formed squadron off Cadiz. This further angered Nelson who saw it as a deliberate diminution of his authority.

===The Spanish squadron===
Orde&#x27;s squadron of six ships of the line were stationed off Cadiz when Villeneuve arrived with the Toulon fleet in April 1805. Orde&#x27;s ships, which were busy revictualling at the time, cast off their store ships and hastily formed line of battle. Villeneuve however, with his eleven ships of the line and six frigates, made no attempt to engage the squadron. Greatly outnumbered, Orde retired, an act that earned him condemnation from some, Nelson included. Villeneuve gathered the ships that were ready to sail and put to sea again. Orde believed they were bound for the English Channel but in fact Villeneuve was on his way to the West Indies. Orde therefore took his squadron north to rendezvous with the Channel Fleet. Although technically correct, Orde&#x27;s behaviour was not in accordance with the country&#x27;s mood at the time and he was ordered to strike his flag. He never served at sea again.

In 1807, Orde became the member of Parliament for Yarmouth, Isle of Wight and served in that capacity until his death on 19 February 1824.

Orde never appeared to reciprocate Nelson&#x27;s animosity and was one of the pall-bearers at Nelson&#x27;s funeral in January 1806.&lt;ref name=&quot;LG15881/2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Sir John Orde was married twice, to Margaret Emma Stephens in 1781, who died in 1790; and Jane Frere in 1793, with whom he had two children: John Powlett Orde, born 9 June 1803 and Anna Maria Fenn Orde, born 1806.

<text>Kuusankoski is a neighbourhood of city of Kouvola, former industrial town and municipality of Finland, located in the region of Kymenlaakso in the province of Southern Finland. The population of Kuusankoski was 20,392 (2003) and the total area was 129.5 km2 of which 114 km2 was land and 14.56 km2 water. It is located some northeast of the Finnish capital Helsinki. Kuusankoski is primarily known for paper manufacturing and three large factory complexes. It is sometimes nicknamed the &quot;Paper capital of Finland&quot;.

== History ==

Kuusankoski (as a municipality, not the settlement), was founded in 1921 from the parts of neighbouring Iitti and Valkeala. It gained the status of &quot;kauppala&quot; (literally &quot;a place of commerce&quot;) in 1957 and became a town in 1973.

The history of Kuusankoski during the last one and a half centuries has been closely linked to the establishment of the paper factories and their development. The establishment of the factories dates back to the 1870s and 1890s, when the rapids of the river Kymijoki were made to deliver electricity to a waking industry. Since then, and until the modern age of automation, the factories have offered jobs to many generations of Kuusankoski citizens, making the area somewhat more prosperous than the neighbouring regions. Today, the influence of the factories on everyday life has somewhat lessened, but their historical importance remains well known.

The cityscape of Kuusankoski consists mostly of element-based blocks of flats built during the 1960s. However, there are some exceptions, such as a school and a church built at the beginning of the last century. Another kind of architecture is represented by the culture building Kuusankoskitalo, a typical creation of modern Finnish architecture, and a library built in a functionalistic style. The cityscape is also characterised by the river Kymijoki which curves through the town.

Footballer Sami Hyypiä is from Kuusankoski. Ex-Nightwish singer Tarja Turunen also lives in the town.

As of 2009, the six municipalities – Kouvola, Kuusankoski, Elimäki, Anjalankoski, Valkeala and Jaala – were consolidated, accounting for the new municipality of Kouvola with a population of over 80,000, being the 10th largest city in Finland.

== Hydropower ==

== Sport ==
Kuusankoski Speedway track () is a motorcycle speedway on the southern outskits of the neighbourhood, off the Kuusaantie road. The speedway track held the final of the Finnish Individual Speedway Championship in 2007.

<text>The dalit is a type of short Filipino poem, consisting of four lines with eight syllables each. 

There is a controversy regarding its origin. One school of thought states that the dalit is Spanish in origin, particularly because its syllabification is even or &quot;pares&quot;. Hence, it is said that the Spanish popularized the dalit in the Philippines. Another view holds that the dalit is indigenous, but the friars used its popularity to promote Catholicism, in the form of meditative verses.

<text>The Borrowers is a children&#x27;s fantasy novel by the English author Mary Norton, published by Dent in 1952. It features a family of tiny people who live secretly in the walls and floors of an English house and &quot;borrow&quot; from the big people in order to survive. &quot;The Borrowers&quot; also refers to the series of five novels including &quot;The Borrowers&quot; and four sequels that feature the same family after they leave &quot;their&quot; house.

&quot;The Borrowers&quot; won the 1952 Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year&#x27;s outstanding children&#x27;s book by a British author. In the 70th anniversary celebration of the medal in 2007, it was named one of the top ten Medal-winning works, selected by a panel to compose the ballot for a public election of the all-time favourite.

Harcourt, Brace and Company published it in the U.S. in 1953 with illustrations by Beth and Joe Krush. It was also published in four parts, with illustrations by Erik Blegvad, during the summer of 1953 (June, July, August, September) in &quot;Woman&#x27;s Day&quot; magazine. There have been several adaptations of &quot;The Borrowers&quot; in television and film.

==Series==

All five &quot;Borrowers&quot; novels feature the Clock family; Pod, Homily and Arrietty. In the first book they live in a house reportedly based on &quot;The Cedars&quot; where Norton was raised. The sequels are titled alliteratively and alphabetically: &quot;The Borrowers Afield&quot; (1955), &quot;The Borrowers Afloat&quot; (1959), &quot;The Borrowers Aloft&quot; (1961), and &quot;The Borrowers Avenged&quot; (1982). All were originally published by J. M. Dent in hardcover editions.
Puffin Books published a 700-page trade paperback omnibus edition in 1983, &quot;The Complete Borrowers Stories&quot; with a short introduction by Norton.

The primary cause of trouble and source of plot is the interaction between the minuscule Borrowers and the &quot;human beans&quot;, whether the human motives are kind or selfish. The main character is teenage Arrietty, who often begins relationships with Big People that have chaotic effects on the lives of herself and her family, causing her parents to react with fear and worry.

The Borrowers are miniature people who live below a clock in a house located in England. Homily, Pod and Arrietty are their names. Pod goes &#x27;Borrowing&#x27; for items, Homily does the usual motherhood jobs and Arrietty becomes even more curious about the human being life each and every day.

As a result of Arrietty&#x27;s curiosity and friendships with Big People, her family are forced to move their home several times from one place to another, making their lives more adventurous than the average Borrower would prefer. After escaping from their home under the kitchen floorboards of an old English manor they finally settle down in the home of a caretaker on the grounds of an old church.

Along the way, they meet more characters: other Borrowers, including a young man around Arrietty&#x27;s age who lives outdoors and whose only memory of his family is the descriptive phrase, &quot;Dreadful Spiller&quot;, which he uses as a name (introduced in &quot;The Borrowers Afield&quot;), the Harpsichord family who are relatives of the Clock family, and Peregrine (&quot;Peagreen&quot;) Overmantel; and also Big People such as Mild Eye the gypsy, Tom Goodenough, the gardener&#x27;s son, and Miss Menzies, a sweet but overly helpful woman.

The short, separate book &quot;Poor Stainless&quot; (1966) was revised as a novelette and re-published posthumously with a short author&#x27;s note in 1994. The narrative, told by Homily to Arrietty, occurs before the first of the full-length &quot;Borrower&quot; novels, and concerns a small adventure Stainless has when he gets lost. (Most &quot;Borrower&quot; names are &quot;borrowed&quot; from human objects. Stainless is named after items in the kitchen cutlery drawer.)

==Summary of &quot;The Borrowers&quot;==
The story begins with a frame story of young Kate sewing a quilt with her aunt Mrs May. Kate complains that some of her sewing supplies have gone missing and wonder where all the small household items that disappear really end up. Mrs May tells Kate about the Borrowers: miniature human-like creatures who live unseen in houses and &quot;borrow&quot; such items from the &quot;human beans&quot; that live there. She goes on to tell the story of how her younger brother once befriended a young Borrower named Arrietty.

Arrietty Clock lives with her parents Pod and Homily under the floor beneath a grandfather clock (Borrowers take their surnames from their living place.) One day Pod comes home shaken from a borrowing expedition. After Arrietty goes to bed, Pod tells Homily that he has been seen by a human boy who had been sent from India to live with his great-aunt while recovering from an illness. Remembering the fate of their niece Eggletina, who disappeared after the &quot;human beans&quot; brought a cat into the house, Pod and Homily decide to tell Arrietty. In the course of the ensuing conversation, Homily realizes that Arrietty ought to be allowed to go borrowing with Pod.

Several days later, Pod invites Arrietty to accompany him on a borrowing trip. Since Arrietty has only ever seen the outdoors through a grating, she is allowed to explore the garden, where she meets the Boy. After some trepidation on both their parts, Arrietty and the Boy strike a bargain: the Boy, who is bilingual and slow to learn English, will bring the highly literate Arrietty books if she will read to him. At one point, Arrietty tells the Boy that the world cannot possibly have enough resources to sustain very many humans. He disagrees and tells her that there are millions of people in India alone. Arrietty becomes upset when she realizes she cannot know that there are any Borrowers other than her own family. The Boy offers to take a letter to a badger sett two fields away where her Uncle Hendreary, Aunt Lupy, and their children are supposed to have emigrated.

Meanwhile, Arrietty learns from Pod and Homily that they get a &quot;feeling&quot; when big people approach. Concerned that she had no &quot;feeling&quot; when near the Boy, she practices by going to a passage below the kitchen, which is more frequently trafficked by humans than the rest of the house. There she overhears the cook Mrs Driver and the gardener Crampfurl discussing the Boy. Driver dislikes children in general and believes the Boy is up to no good, particularly when Crampfurl suspects that the Boy is keeping a pet ferret after seeing him in a field calling for &quot;Uncle something.&quot;

The Boy delivers Arrietty&#x27;s letter and returns with a mysterious response asking Arrietty to tell Aunt Lupy to come back. Pod catches Arrietty taking the letter from the Boy and brings her home. After Arrietty confesses everything she has told the Boy, Pod and Homily fear they will be forced to emigrate. The Boy soon finds the Clocks&#x27; home and brings them gifts of dollhouse furniture from the nursery. They experience a period of &quot;borrowing beyond all dreams of borrowing&quot; as the Boy returns with gift after gift. In return, Arrietty is allowed to go outside and read to him.

Driver suspects the Boy of stealing after catching him trying to open a curio cabinet full of valuable miniatures. One night she finds Arrietty&#x27;s house from the bright candle light shining through the floorboards. Believing this is where the Boy cached his stolen goods, Driver peers beneath the boards and is horrified to discover the Borrowers in their home. To prevent the Boy from helping the Borrowers escape, she locks him in his room until it is time for him to return to India. Meanwhile, she hires a rat catcher to fumigate the house in order to trap the Borrowers. Driver cruelly allows the Boy out of his room so that he can watch when the Borrowers&#x27; bodies are found. The Boy manages to escape her and, running outside, break open the grating in hopes of providing an escape route. As he waits for the Borrowers to emerge, the cab arrives to take him away. Driver drags him to the cab and forces him inside, leaving the fate of the Borrowers unknown.

Some time later, the Boy&#x27;s sister (a young Mrs May) visits the home herself in hopes of proving her brother&#x27;s stories were real. She leaves small gifts at the badgers&#x27; sett, which are gone the next time she checks. Later she finds a miniature memoranda book in which the entire story of the Borrowers has been written, presumably by Arrietty. When Kate rejoices that the book means that the Borrowers survived and that the whole story was true, Mrs May points out that &quot;Arrietty&#x27;s&quot; handwriting was identical to Mrs May&#x27;s brother&#x27;s.

==Characters==
;Borrowers
* Arrietty Clock: An adventurous and curious fourteen-year-old Borrower. She knows how to read, owns a collection of pocket-sized books, and is fascinated with &quot;human beans&quot; after meeting The Boy. She is also the only Borrower educated enough to comprehend that the Borrowers may be dying out. In later books, her interactions with humans frequently cause concern for her parents.
* Pod Clock: Arrietty&#x27;s father. A talented Borrower and a shoemaker who creates button boots out of beads and old kid gloves. He is cautious, but not opposed to new ideas, and a quick inventor and improviser. 
* Homily Clock: Arrietty&#x27;s mother, a nervous woman who likes her tidy domestic world and can&#x27;t bear the thought of hardship or discomfort. Nevertheless, she often shows fortitude in difficult or dangerous situations, though she complains constantly through them. She is extremely proud of Arrietty and encourages her to educate herself through reading.
* Hendreary Clock: Arrietty&#x27;s uncle and Pod&#x27;s brother. He and his family were one of many Borrower families who used to live in the house, but they were eventually forced to leave after Hendreary was &quot;seen.&quot; When he finally appears in later books, he is a weary, dispirited man who allows his wife to make all their important decisions.
* Lupy (Rain-Pipe Harpsichord) Clock – Uncle Hendreary&#x27;s wife and a distant relation to Homily. Homily dislikes Lupy for putting on airs because she was once a member of the prestigious Harpsichord family, though she envies Lupy&#x27;s elegance and refinement. She has three sons from a previous marriage and a stepdaughter, Eggletina. She is prissy, bossy, and dominating.
* Eggletina Clock: Hendreary&#x27;s daughter from his first marriage. Eggletina&#x27;s family attempted to protect her by lying about the Big House and failed to inform her that her father had been &quot;seen.&quot; Unaware of the dangers, Eggletina was also unaware that the &quot;human beans&quot; had brought in a cat. She wandered out to explore and was presumed eaten, though, in the second book, Arrietty learns that she is still alive and that she is a thin, shy girl.
* The Overmantels: A family of Borrowers who lived on the drawing-room mantelpiece, they were snobbish and given to airs, but Homily pities them because they were forced to live on nothing but breakfast food and often went hungry. The Overmantels were one of many Borrower families that emigrated once there were too few humans to sustain them.
* The Rain-Pipes: A family of Borrowers who lived in a drainpipe, they were considered lower-class because their home was prone to flooding, frequently wiping out all their possessions and leaving them destitute. Aunt Lupy was born a Rain-Pipe until she married into the Harpsichord family. Their fate is unknown but presumably they, too, moved away.
* The Harpsichords: Another family of Borrowers who lived in the drawing-room wainscot where a harpsichord used to stand. They mixed with the Overmantels and were likewise prone to putting on airs. Lupy married into the Harpsichord family and had three sons before presumably being left a widow. The Harpsichords had lovely manners but likewise suffered from a lack of food. They too emigrated once the drawing room stopped being used.
* The Bell-Pulls: Homily&#x27;s parents. It is implied that they died of natural causes between Homily&#x27;s marriage and Arrietty&#x27;s early childhood, as Arrietty cannot remember them.
* The Rainbarrels, the Linen-Presses, the Boot-Racks, the Stove-Pipes, the Hon. John Studdingtons: Former Borrower families who once lived in the house. All moved away after their respective areas of the house ceased to be used. (In the case of the Hon. John Studdingtons, they lived behind a portrait of The Boy&#x27;s great-uncle.)

; Big People
* Kate: A &quot;wild, untidy, self-willed little girl&quot;, 10 years of age. Kate learns of the Borrowers in the first book. In later books, a slightly older Kate makes a habit of trying to find out more clues of their existence.
* The Boy: A ten-year-old boy sent to recover from an illness at the country home of his great-aunt near Leighton Buzzard. As he was raised in India, he has difficulty reading in English and is often thoughtful and quiet, a trait the servants interpret as &quot;sly&quot; and untrustworthy. He befriends Arrietty and her family.
* Mrs May/Aunt May: Kate&#x27;s elderly aunt who tells Kate the story of the Borrowers. The Boy was her brother, and as a young woman, she heard his tales of the Borrowers and spent a good deal of time seeking the truth of them. In subsequent books, an adult May inherits a cottage reputed to be the home of more Borrowers.
* Great-Aunt Sophy: The Boy&#x27;s elderly great-aunt, is an invalid who never comes downstairs. The servants (and the Borrowers) refer to her as &quot;Her.&quot; She spends most of her time in bed drinking wine. Pod sometimes comes to visit her while she is drunk, leading her to believe that the Borrowers are a hallucination.
* Mrs Driver: The housekeeper and cook. With Great-Aunt Sophy confined to bed, Mrs Driver is in charge of the whole house. She is grumpy, bossy, gossipy, and resents being required to look after The Boy, whom she dislikes on sight.
* Crampfurl: The gardener and Mrs Driver&#x27;s crony. He, too, dislikes The Boy based solely on Driver&#x27;s suspicions.
* Rosa Pickhatchet: A former housemaid who quit after seeing a Borrower.

==Themes==
* A. N. Wilson considered the work as in part an allegory of post-war Britain – with its picture of a diminished people living in an old, half-empty, decaying “Big House”.

<text>The Neon Bible is John Kennedy Toole&#x27;s first novel, written at the age of 16. The novel is a bildungsroman about a callow youth named David in rural Mississippi during the late 1930s to early 1950s. He learns of religious, racial, social, and sexual bigotry in the narrator&#x27;s ten strongest memories, one memory per chapter. The memories begin with David on a train, escaping the past, hoping for freedom. The book is told entirely from the first person.

==Plot summary==
The story begins with Aunt Mae, a former actress and singer, moving in with David&#x27;s white working-class family in the middle of a small southern town. Aunt Mae becomes sexually involved with a 70-year-old man, ending when he is arrested on morality charges. From subsequent events David learns he does not get along with the other boys his own age. At this point, suggestive of the Great Depression, David&#x27;s father, Frank, loses his factory job. The family moves to an older house on a hill overlooking the town.

The family&#x27;s circumstances worsen and Frank becomes frustrated. One week he spends his entire paycheck on seeds and other farming supplies. His wife insists that crops cannot grow in the clay of the hill soil. An argument ensues and he strikes her with his knee, knocking out one of her teeth. She bleeds badly, but it eventually subsides. Subsequently, Frank is shipped to Italy to fight in World War II.

While Frank is in Italy, a traveling &#x27;revival&#x27; ministry visits town. The traveling preacher teaches that popular dance is a prelude to &#x27;immorality&#x27;. The town&#x27;s local preacher opposes this incursion and begins a rival Bible study class. These options divide the town. Through editorials in the newspaper and spots on the town radio station, each side attacks the other. Meanwhile, Aunt Mae takes a job in the local propeller factory as a supervisor. At a company dance which she organizes, Aunt Mae entertains by singing. This leads to her being invited to join the hired band, singing for pay.

David&#x27;s mother goes insane after learning that Frank had been killed in Italy. She becomes uncommunicative, spending most of her time among the wild pines that have grown over Frank&#x27;s failed crops, otherwise fixating her attention on a photograph of a graveyard that she received via telegram notifying her of Frank&#x27;s death. David and Aunt Mae take care of her, as Aunt Mae pursues singing. At age 15, David gets a job at the pharmacy in town. There he encounters Jo Lynne, a girl visiting the valley while her grandfather is ill. After seeing a melodramatic movie, David and Jo Lynne kiss. Shortly thereafter, Jo Lynne abruptly leaves town when her grandfather recovers and angrily rejects David’s pleas to stay, leaving him confused and anguished.

Clyde, a member of Aunt Mae&#x27;s band, is in love with her, and is certain they would get a record deal in Nashville. She leaves for Nashville, promising that she will immediately send for David and his mother. On strength of this promise, David quits his job. After seeing Aunt Mae off, he reflects on his situation. He does not know his mother&#x27;s whereabouts, but assumes she is in the house since she is afraid to go out at night. He fixes himself dinner rather than searching the house for his mother. After eating, as he climbs the stairs he steps in blood. He finds his mother collapsed, bleeding profusely from her mouth. He picks her up and puts her into bed. The bleeding quells with the help of an old blanket, but it is too late. After some time, she dies, exhaling one last word — &quot;Frank.&quot;

Immediately, the imperious local preacher arrives announcing he is taking David&#x27;s mother to an asylum. David tells the preacher to leave, but the man is undaunted, and begins to charge up the stairs to get David&#x27;s mother. David grabs his father&#x27;s rifle and shoots the preacher through the back of the head, killing him. David then buries his mother in the yard and walks into town, using money given to him by the pharmacy owner, Mr. Williams, to board a train, hoping to start anew wherever he might be destined for.

==Publication==
Like &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot;, the novel had a long and difficult road to publication. &quot;The Neon Bible&quot; was written in 1954, but after initial attempts at securing a publisher proved fruitless, the novel was put aside and Toole eventually began work on &quot;Confederacy&quot;. Toole, describing the novel during correspondence with an editor he was pitching &quot;Confederacy&quot; to, wrote of it &quot;In 1954, when I was 16, I wrote a book called &quot;The Neon Bible&quot;, a grim, adolescent, sociological attack upon the hatreds caused by the various Calvinist religions in the South—and the fundamentalist mentality is one of the roots of what was happening in Alabama, etc. The book, of course, was bad, but I sent it off a couple of times anyway.&quot; Toole committed suicide in 1969, leaving the unpublished manuscripts of &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; and &quot;The Neon Bible&quot; in the possession of Thelma Toole, his mother.

Louisiana&#x27;s Napoleonic code-influenced inheritance law meant that these works technically belonged not only to Thelma Toole, but also to several other relatives on his father&#x27;s side of the family. However, as the initial print run of &quot;Confederacy&quot; was only 2,500 copies (and was distributed by the small and non-mainstream Louisiana State University Press) no one figured that owning rights to the book would be especially profitable. Accordingly, Thelma Toole was able to convince these relatives to give up their rights to &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot;.

When &quot;Confederacy&quot; became a Pulitzer Prize winner and a commercial success in 1981, the situation changed. Toole&#x27;s relatives knew that if issued as a follow-up novel, &quot;The Neon Bible&quot; could bring in a substantial amount of money. Consequently, they refused to give up their shared rights to this novel. Meanwhile, Thelma Toole refused to have the novel published if it meant that large portions of the income it derived would go to these relatives.

Thelma Toole died in 1984, but instructed author W. Kenneth Holditch to act on her behalf and keep the book from being published even after her death. Although Holditch attempted to respect Thelma&#x27;s wishes (even though he did not agree with them), the relatives eventually filed a formal lawsuit that would have put the book up for auction. Holditch knew that no matter how it was auctioned off, the outcome of the legal action would be that the book would be legally published. He therefore allowed &quot;The Neon Bible&quot; to see publication in 1989, before the &quot;spectacle&quot; of an auction could be held.

==Adaptations==
In 1995 a movie of the book was released. The film &quot;The Neon Bible&quot; was directed by Terence Davies, with a screenplay by Davies based on Toole&#x27;s novel. The cast includes Drake Bell, Leo Burmester, Denis Leary, Peter McRobbie, Gena Rowlands, Diana Scarwid, and Jacob Tierney.

<text>The Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick () is the deliberative assembly of the New Brunswick Legislature, in the province of New Brunswick, Canada. The assembly&#x27;s seat is located in Fredericton. It was established in Saint John &quot;de jure&quot; when the colony was created in 1784 but came into session only in 1786, following the first elections in late 1785. The legislative assembly was originally the lower house in a bicameral legislature. Its upper house counterpart, the Legislative Council of New Brunswick, was abolished in 1891. Its members are called &quot;Members of the Legislative Assembly&quot;, commonly referred to as &quot;MLAs&quot;.

==History==
Nova Scotia originally covered most of the territory of today&#x27;s Maritime provinces. In 1784, New Brunswick became a distinct colony from Nova Scotia. Saint John was chosen as the original capital when New Brunswick was formed as it was the centre of commerce and the only city at that time. 

The first elections took place in November 1785. The legislative assembly came into session in January 1786. It was originally the lower house in a bicameral legislature. Its upper house counterpart, the Legislative Council of New Brunswick, was abolished on April 16, 1891.

== Legislative Building ==
The New Brunswick Legislative Building is the current building that houses the Assembly. It opened in 1882, having been constructed by J.C. Dumaresq, following the destruction of the original building, known as Province Hall, by fire in 1880.

The legislative chamber is designed to have four rows on the government side and three rows on the opposition side. This is because elections have traditionally yielded a strong government majority; in fact on occasion, even with many of the seats on one side of the House, the government has spilled over to the opposition side. Quite often the House is oriented to have only two rows on the opposition benches, in the event of a large opposition adding a third row makes the opposition benches rather crowded.

<text>Mount Massive (Arapaho: Hiwoxuu hookuhu&#x27;ee) is the second-highest summit of the Rocky Mountains of North America and the U.S. state of Colorado. It is located in the Mount Massive Wilderness of San Isabel National Forest, west-southwest (bearing 247°) of the City of Leadville in Lake County, Colorado, United States. Mount Massive edges out the third-highest summit of the Rockies, Mount Harvard, by , but falls short of Mount Elbert by . It ranks as the third-highest peak in the contiguous United States after Mount Whitney and Mount Elbert.

==Mountain==
Mount Massive was first surveyed and climbed in 1873 during the Hayden Survey of the American West. Survey member Henry Gannett is credited with the first ascent. Its name comes from its elongated shape: it has five summits, all above , and a summit ridge over long, resulting in more area above than any other mountain in the 48 contiguous states, narrowly edging Mount Rainier in that category. Mount Elbert () is Mount Massive&#x27;s nearest neighbor among the fourteeners; it lies about south-southeast of the peak.

A matter of some contention after the Great Depression arose over the heights of Massive and its neighbor, Mount Elbert, which have a height difference of only . This led to an ongoing dispute which came to a head with the Mount Massive supporters taking it upon themselves to build large piles of stones on the summit to boost its height, only to have the Mount Elbert proponents demolish them.

A class 2 hiking path leads to the peak from the eastern face. The path is round trip, with a elevation gain. There is also a class 2 route along the southwest slopes.

There are several glacial lakes in the wilderness area. The lower slopes of the mountain are covered in lodgepole pine forests, which gradually yield to Engelmann Spruce and Fir. Treeline is just below 12,000 feet. Among the mountain&#x27;s fauna are the American pika, the mountain goat, elk, mule deer, moose, Canada jay, martin, and the yellow-bellied marmot.

In the Arapaho Language the Collegiate Range and Mount Massive are called &quot;Hiwoxuu hookuhu&#x27;ee&quot; or Elk&#x27;s Head.

<doc id="666748" wikidata="Q438175" url="?curid=666748" title="Paul Waaktaar-Savoy">
<text>Paul Waaktaar-Savoy (born Pål Gamst, 6 September 1961) is a Norwegian musician and songwriter. Waaktaar-Savoy is best known for his work as the main songwriter and guitarist in the Norwegian synth-pop band a-ha, which has sold more than 50 million albums worldwide. He has written or co-written most of the band&#x27;s biggest hits, including &quot;The Sun Always Shines on T.V.&quot;, &quot;Hunting High and Low&quot;, &quot;Take On Me&quot;, the 1987 James Bond theme &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; and the ballad &quot;Summer Moved On&quot;. In addition, Waaktaar-Savoy is also a painter.

Waaktaar-Savoy was named Knights First Class of the Order of St. Olav by King Harald for his services to Norwegian music and his international success.

==Early life==
Waaktaar-Savoy was born to the Gamst family on 6 September 1961 in Tonsenhagen, Norway, at the outskirts of Oslo, and was raised in Oslo&#x27;s Manglerud district with his older sister Tonje. His birth name is Pål Gamst; in the Norwegian language, an acceptable alternate spelling of his first name is Paal. His father, Olav, was a pharmacist, and his mother, Gerd, worked at the phone company. He is a distant relative of Norwegian footballer Morten Gamst Pedersen.

His parents appreciated classical music, and encouraged young Pål first to learn the flute, then to study music composition when his performance skill revealed him to be a child prodigy. He admired the music of American rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix, and hoped one day to write a rock opera similar to &quot;Hair&quot;. He used his mother&#x27;s family name, Waaktaar, in his stage name, to become Pål Waaktaar. He also enjoyed reading and painting. He was a loner, not social at school, and was unsuccessful attracting girlfriends in his teens.

Before becoming a guitarist, Pål was a drummer. He would usually tap his drumsticks on the wall, but this made his neighbors angry so he decided to make his first drum kit out of boxes. One of his friends was a keyboard player, so they would play together, opening the window to play a concert for whoever passed by. One of those people was his soon to be bandmate Magne Furuholmen. They were about 10 years old when they met and they bonded over the love of music, and Pål soon got really interested in Magne when he learned that his grandfather had an electric guitar and an amplifier. Pål&#x27;s first band had been titled Black Days, and he formed the band Spider Empire with Magne, he on drums and Magne on guitar. They would play together in Magne&#x27;s classroom before the formation of their next band with Viggo Bondi and Øystein Jevanord. 

Before turning to music full time, Pål&#x27;s first job was scrubbing floors underground and he also worked at a deli with Magne. They would mess up a lot of the orders, so this didn&#x27;t last very long.

==Music career==
===Bridges===

Pål Waaktaar, as he was then known, was lead singer, guitarist and songwriter in the Norwegian rock band Bridges, along with keyboardist Magne Furuholmen (with whom he later formed a-ha with singer Morten Harket), drummers Erik Hagelien and Øystein Jevanord, and bassist Viggo Bondi. In 1980, Bridges released their first album, the self-financed LP &quot;Fakkeltog&quot;. Although the title is Norwegian (meaning torchlight procession), the songs are in English. At the request of Harket, a-ha performed the &quot;Fakkeltog&quot; song &quot;The Vacant&quot; (renamed &quot;Sox of the Fox&quot;) during their 2017 &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; performance, released as &quot;MTV Unplugged – Summer Solstice&quot;.

An unreleased Bridges song called &quot;Miss Eerie&quot; later evolved into &quot;Lesson One&quot; and then into the a-ha hit &quot;Take On Me&quot;.

In 2018, Bridges&#x27; second album, &quot;Våkenatt&quot; (&quot;Wakeful Night&quot;), was released. The album was recorded in late 1980 and early 1981, but was discarded after Paul and Magne Furuholmen decided to go to London, which made Viggo Bondi and Øystein Jevanord to leave the group.

===a-ha===
Waaktaar-Savoy is the lead guitarist and main songwriter for a-ha, one of the most successful bands of the 1980s. Once &quot;Q Magazine&quot; named him as one of the best unknown lyricists of his generation. a-ha performed &quot;Summer Moved On&quot; live at the Nobel-Peace-Prize-Concert following a hiatus. After this, they decided to record a new album and, in 2000, a-ha had the comeback of the year, followed by a sold-out tour. The a-ha album &quot;Lifelines&quot; was released in 2002. The following tour was documented in a-ha&#x27;s second official live album, &quot;How Can I Sleep with Your Voice in My Head&quot;, which was released in March 2003.

In 2005 the compilation album &quot;The Singles: 1984-2004&quot; was released, their last album with WEA. After that, a-ha signed to Universal. &quot;Analogue&quot; was released later that year. The title-track entered the UK-charts at No. 10. The band&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;Foot of the Mountain&quot; was released in 2009. After that they split, but in 2015 reunited again and released a new studio album, &quot;Cast in Steel&quot;.

Waaktaar-Savoy has said &quot;Morten is totally different from me. When we first came to London together, he burned all my clothes and re-dressed me from head to toe. I don&#x27;t care much about clothes, whereas he&#x27;s always very interested in them. He has given me self-confidence, encourages me to talk to people, not to be afraid and to use the abilities I have. Morten is actually the only one in Norway who had as much ambition as I did. I guess we both have big egos. In a way, we&#x27;re each sitting in our own little world, while Mags is more down to earth. Mags often has to mediate between Morten and me... It&#x27;s good that we&#x27;re so different and still respect each other. The tension between us is creative. No one sings like Morten. He&#x27;s got what it takes and I have great faith in him.&quot;

====a-ha awarded Order of St. Olav====

The three members of a-ha, Morten Harket, Magne Furuholmen and Waaktaar-Savoy, were appointed Knights of the 1st Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav for their contribution to Norwegian music.
The Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav is granted as a reward for distinguished services to their country and mankind.
The official ceremony took place on 6 November 2012.

===Savoy===
With his wife Lauren Savoy, and drummer Frode Unneland, he has produced many CDs as the band Savoy. In 2001 Waaktaar released his fourth studio album, &quot;Reasons to Stay Indoors&quot;, which was again a big success in Norway. On 30 August 2004, Savoy released their fifth studio album called &#x27;Savoy&#x27; through their own label, &quot;Eleventeen Records&quot;.

Savoy achieved great success in Norway, selling over 300,000 records. They have been nominated for Spellemannprisen (Norwegian equivalent of the Grammy Award) four times and have won three times. a-ha&#x27;s version of the song &quot;Velvet&quot; appears in the film &quot;One Night at McCool&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Whalebone&quot; appears in the highly acclaimed Norwegian film &quot;Hawaii, Oslo&quot;.

With Jimmy Gnecco he presented Weathervane as a new project in June 2011. Their self-titled single (Weathervane) appears on the soundtrack for the movie &quot;Headhunters&quot; (based on the book &quot;Hodejegerne&quot; by Jo Nesbø).

===Waaktaar===
In February 2014 Waaktaar-Savoy premiered a new track under the name Waaktaar through a-ha.com. The track is called &quot;Manmade Lake&quot;.

===Waaktaar and Zoe===
In September 2016 Waaktaar-Savoy formed a new duo with singer Zoe Gnecco (daughter of Weathervane singer Jimmy Gnecco), called Waaktaar and Zoe. They released two singles, &quot;Beautiful Burnout&quot; (2016) and &quot;Tearful Girl&quot; (January 2018), both taken from the album &quot;World of Trouble&quot;, released in February 2017.

==Painting==
Waaktaar-Savoy has painted all his life. His trademark is not starting to paint until the canvas has been fitted with a frame. This trait was played upon in his debut and so far sole exhibition &quot;Rammer&quot; (meaning &quot;Frames&quot; in Norwegian) in Lillehammer, Norway in 1998.

==Descriptions by the rest of a-ha==
Magne Furuholmen describes Waaktaar-Savoy thus: &quot;Pål is the person who has meant most to me in my musical development and yet he&#x27;s the one person I find it most difficult to say anything sensible about. He has incredible will-power and a watchful eye, always searching for material he can use creatively. In a way, I have idolized Pål for years and I still depend on him to help me sort out my own ideas.&quot;

Morten Harket describes Waaktaar-Savoy thus: &quot;Pål has unbelievable self-discipline and is a workaholic. He can keep working on what appears to be the same thing over and over again. While I go crazy when I have to go over a song hundreds of times, he can sit with it for hours, trying to find exactly the right mix to achieve the sound he wants. Pål is really the driving force behind a-ha. He&#x27;s one of the few real artists on the pop rock scene. It&#x27;s always exciting to hear what he&#x27;s written.&quot;

==Personal life==

Waaktaar met American filmmaker and musician Lauren Savoy in 1984, and they married in a civil ceremony on 21 December 1991, officiated by the Norwegian Bar Association leader Merete Smith, with family and bandmates in attendance. The couple combined surnames to create Waaktaar-Savoy. They have one child together, True August Waaktaar-Savoy, born in 1999. The family divides its time between New York City and Oslo. After years of fighting the Anglophone media to correct the spelling of his first name, in 1994 he settled on a spelling of &quot;Paul&quot;.

<text>Valledupar () is a city and municipality in northeastern Colombia. It is the capital of Cesar Department. Its name, &quot;Valle de Upar&quot; (Valley of Upar), was established in honor of the Amerindian cacique who ruled the valley; &quot;Cacique Upar&quot;. The city lies between the mountains of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and the Serranía del Perijá to the borders of the Guatapurí and Cesar rivers.

Valledupar is an important agricultural, cattle raising, coal mining and agro-industrial center for the region between the Departments of Cesar and southern municipalities of La Guajira Department, formerly known as the Padilla Province. Valledupar is notable as the cradle of &quot;vallenato&quot; music, representative of the Colombian culture. The city hosts the Vallenato Legend Festival.

During the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s, the city suffered during the Colombian Armed Conflict, with numerous kidnappings, thousands of people forced out and failure to control crime.

Valledupar has one of Colombia&#x27;s most modern maximum security prisons.

== Geography ==
Valledupar is located southeast of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. Its average temperature is 28 °C. Because of its relatively high altitude and proximity to the equator, it has a variety of environments, from warm heat to perpetual snow. Notable geographic features in Valledupar include the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta&#x27;s peaks; the Codazzi, El Guardian, the Ojeda and La Reina. Many rivers descend from its snowy peaks and lagoons; the Ariguani, Ariguanicito, Badillo, Calderas, Cesar, Curiba, Donachui, Garupal, Guatapuri, which borders the city of Valledupar; and the Mariangola.

The Municipality of Valledupar is bordered on the north with the municipalities of Riohacha and San Juan del Cesar in the department of La Guajira. To the south are the municipalities of El Paso and Los Robles La Paz in the department of Cesar; to the east are the municipalities of Villanueva and Urumita, also in the Department of La Guajira; and to the west are the municipalities Fundacion and Aracataca, in the department of Magdalena.

The municipality has an area of about 4,977.96 km², from which 72,660 km² pertain to the Arhuacos Indian Reserve, 399.52 km² to the Kogui and Wiwa Indian Reserve, and 425.60 km² to the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta National Park.

=== Fauna and flora ===
The municipality is home to numerous endemic species, mostly living in the ecosystem of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and Serrania del Perijá mountains, one of the most biodiverse places in the world. The most recently discovered species of bees was found in rural areas of Valledupar and named Stelis vallenata in tribute to the local Vallenato music.

The city&#x27;s symbolic bird is the Turpial. Other notable birds that inhabit the region are the parrots that flock the fruit trees year round.

During the colonial period, Spaniards introduced invasive European fauna into the region, such as dogs, cats, rats, mice, cattle, horses, mules, goats and gallineta africana, doves, among others. Spaniards also introduced numerous species of flora from all over the world into the region, most notably mango trees, which have become the most popular tree in the city and municipality. However, the symbolic trees of the city are two types of Yellow Tabebuia, colloquially called &quot;Cañaguate&quot; and &quot;Puy&quot;. These trees cover the region with their notorious yellow blossom flowers during the dry season.

The entities in charge of protecting and controlling the fauna and flora in the region are the Colombian Ministry of Environment, the local decentralized agency Corpocesar, under the Governor of the Cesar Department and Environmental Police of the Colombian National Police. Other non-profit organizations collaborate with these entities.

=== Climate ===
Climate in the municipality of Valledupar is determined by altitude. Half of the region is mountainous and the rest is plains in between the mountain ranges of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and the Serrania del Perijá. Throughout the year, the region has two dry seasons and two rainy seasons affected by El Niño and La Niña phenomena. The peaks of the mountainous region gets snow during the rainy season and much cooler days and depending on the weather, the entire region gets hit lightly by hailstorms and thunderstorms. The regions is slightly affected by the annual Caribbean hurricane season.
The levels of rivers and bodies of water increase in the rainy season, and vegetation grows green and bushy. During the dry season, vegetation dries and turns mostly yellow, while bodies of water decrease in volume.

In 2013, Valledupar was classified on average as the hottest place in Colombia, according to the Colombian Meteorological Institute, IDEAM.

== History ==

The Spanish named the Valle de Upar (Valley of Upar) after a legendary local Amerindian cacique, Upar, leader of the indigenous Chimila. The region was first explored by Pedro de Badillo. It was conquered in 1532 by the German Ambrosius Ehinger, governor of Venezuela, who invaded the area belonging to the government of Santa Marta. The city was founded in 1550 by the Spanish conquistador, Captain Hernando de Santana, who named it. The Catholic Church commonly referred to the city as &quot;Ciudad de los Santos Reyes de Valle de Upar&quot; (city of the holy kings of Valledupar) because it was founded on the 6th day of January, Epiphany, the day the three kings visited the infant Jesus. The name was gradually modified to Valle Dupar and then to Valledupar.

Since the colonization period, the region has been a center for imports from the Caribbean area and distribution to the inland. Spaniards traveled through the area and established extensive farming, mainly rearing imported European cattle (among many animals) and agriculture. Much of the population of the Chimila Nation died from epidemics of new infectious diseases carried by the Europeans; survivors were worked at forced labor, and many died during battles.

On May 22, 1810, some 400 inhabitants of the Cabildo of the Valle de Upar rebelled against the Spanish monarchy, protesting against Mayor Colonel Marques de Valde-Hoyos. The mayor fled to neighboring San Juan del Cesar, leaving in charge V. Ruiz de Gomez. In 1813 independence from Spain was proclaimed by María Concepción Loperena de Fernandez de Castro, a wealthy land owner who helped supply three hundred horses to &quot;El Libertador&quot; Simón Bolívar&#x27;s revolutionary army.

In 1850, the city became capital of the Valledupar Province and in 1864 was elevated to capital of the Valledupar Department of the Federal State of Magdalena. In 1915, after the political and administrative division restructuring of the Unitarian Colombian State, Valledupar was proclaimed the municipality of the Valledupar Province, part of the Federal State of Magdalena during the United States of Colombia era. The region maintained relative isolation from the rest of the country due to its low importance at the time. The violent political struggles of the different governments of Colombia took place mostly in larger cities, such as Bogotá.

During World War II, the city received many immigrants from Europe, especially French, Germans and Italians. Later it attracted immigrants from the Middle East. In 1956 it was proclaimed a parish by the Catholic Church. After the Republic of Colombia was created and the Department of Cesar was established in 1967, Valledupar became its capital.

The region started developing quickly due to political support from the former President Alfonso López Michelsen, first governor of the Department of Cesar&#x27;s and the Colombian Liberal Party. Valledupar came to be known as &quot;sorpresa caribe&quot; (the Caribbean surprise) because of its rapid economic growth during the 1970s, especially in cotton production, which local people called &quot;white gold&quot;. Valledupar ranked second overall in economic profits for Colombia during this time. Urban growth and social change accompanied prosperity and the city developed its cultural identity throughout these years. The revival of the &quot;Vallenato&quot; music strongly symbolizes the culture of Colombia.

A period of violence erupted during the mid-1980s, disrupting the peaceful growth. A struggling leftist political party, the Patriotic Union (U.P.), was led by a banker, Juvenal Ovidio Ricardo Palmera Pineda. Because of his incendiary remarks during a peasant strike and protest in the main plaza, he was jailed. After being given amnesty by Jorge Dangond Daza, the governor of the Department, Palmera went into hiding. The national government and conservative groups started a persecution of UP&#x27;s leaders and followers. Many of Palmera&#x27;s followers went into exile in Europe.

He escaped into the mountains, taking refuge with the armed branch of the UP; the FARC. Palmera became a guerrilla leader; as a banker, he knew who in the city and region were wealthy. He began kidnapping (and sometimes killing) prominent political leaders, journalists and rich land owners (including members of his own family), using the ransoms to finance his organization. He took the alias &quot;Simón Trinidad&quot;.

During this period, general crime rose and, on October 15, 1994, the national bank &quot;El Banco de la Republica&quot; (Bank of the Republic) was robbed. The amount stolen: COP$24,075 million of non emitted bills (some US$11 million) and came to be known as the &quot;El Robo del Siglo&quot; (The bank heist of the century).

To counter FARC and ELN&#x27;s abuses, and after approximately fifteen years of asphyxiating Valledupar&#x27;s society and supporting negligence by the Colombian military, some prominent leaders of Valledupar, landowners and those victims of these organizations decided to become part or promote, self-defense forces that later on affiliated with the AUC and assigned another &quot;Vallenatean&quot; as leader Rodrigo Tovar Pupo a.k.a. Jorge 40.

The self-defense forces adopted methods like the guerrilla, including illegal drug trafficking to finance their operations. They used terrorism tactics that also affected innocent people, such as selective and random kidnappings, and combinations of racketeering and selective assassinations – the trademark of Death Squads. The AUC helped take back the region from guerrillas, but Valledupar residents had to deal with similar uncertainty in having an illegal and terrorist organization controlling the city.

The AUC northern block demobilized March 10, 2006. It is still uncertain if the Colombian military can control the two terrorist organizations or dismantle them. Because of the longstanding violence, many rural people migrated into the city. Prominent regional leaders have been killed; others were forced into bankruptcy or out of the region.

Despite the violence, since it became capital of the Department of Cesar, Valledupar developed as an important agricultural and cattle raising center for the region between the departments of Cesar and southern parts of La Guajira. It is most notable as the cradle of vallenato music, which is played with accordion, a small drum (&quot;caja&quot;) and a scraping instrument (&quot;guacharaca&quot;). Since 1968 at the end of April, the city has held an annual four-day festival, the Vallenato Legend Festival.

== Politics ==

The Department of Cesar&#x27;s government and Chamber of Deputies offices are based in Valledupar as well as other Department level entities. At City level, the Mayor of the City and the City counselors have a three-year term in office, and are in charge of local government issues. The mayor&#x27;s powers are highly dependent on the budgets assigned by the Departmental government in order to execute plans.

Many local government leaders have been involved in corruption cases, investigated and sometimes incarcerated. The government bureaucracy is highly politicized, with the execution of some plans dependent on political interests and winning advantages over political adversaries. The local judiciary is also vulnerable to corruption, as well as being a target of terrorists and guerrillas.

=== Ethnicities ===

Three groups of Amerindians, part of the Tairona culture, are based near this region inside Indian reserves, all named for the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta: the Arhuaco Reserve (pop. 18,500); the Kankuamo Reserve (pop. 12,000) and the Kogi-Wiwa Reserve (pop. 4,500). The Amerindian cultures have contributed traditional arts and crafts, as well as many crop management. Africans contributed to the food, religion and music and Europeans contributed to architecture, growth of the Catholic religion and other aspects, especially that of the Spanish colonial period.

The Vallenato music has been a creole fusion of these three cultures; the European accordion, the African drum and percussive elements, and the &quot;guacharaca&quot; from the Amerindians.

Other waves of European immigrants came during the 1940s to 1950s while trying to escape World War II or social crisis; mostly from Spain, Germany and France.

From approximately the 1960s, waves of immigrants from the Middle East started arriving in the city. They have been sympathetically nicknamed &quot;Turcos&quot; (Turks) by locals. Immigrants have been welcomed and are able to become part of society, marrying into traditional Valledupar families.

== Economy ==

The economy of Valledupar is based primarily on commerce, retail and banking in the urban area, mainly in the service industry and tourism during the four-day Vallenato Legend Festival. The city also serves as a business hub for the two nearby coal mines, Cerrejon (La Guajira) and Drummond (Cesar).
The region&#x27;s economy also relies on the primary sector; Agriculture and cattle raising which are the historical backbone of the local economy. During the 1970s, the region experienced an economic boom because of a massive production of cotton when worldwide demand was high. This helped to modernize Valledupar, and it became the second most productive region in Colombia for some time. The cotton boom ended during the 1980s because of a decrease in cotton production during the years of violence. The resulting economic recession left many in debt and unable to repay loans to the banks. During these years &quot;marimberos&quot;, or marijuana sellers, also produced and contributed to the economic boom, because of the high demand in the United States.

Valledupar mainly produces cotton, rice, oil palm, tobacco, coffee, cocoa and other cash crops. Since the late 20th century, the city has benefited from the department of Cesar&#x27;s development of coal mining in the region of La Jagua de Ibirico and El Paso. The secondary sector has been flourishing from a few agricultural products and derivates from cattle.

Terrorist groups are still present and affect the local economy; The FARC, ELN and former AUC, mostly financed by the illegal drug trade. Other mafia-style groups BACRIMs have flourished in the region, shifting from illegal drug production to illegal trafficking of fuel from Venezuela as well as other products. These groups contribute to the illicit drugs industry in the region. They cultivate great quantities of opium poppies and marihuana around the area.

The region is using technology in order to develop into a more modern city. In a smaller scale, other sources of the economy are: fishing, transportation, construction, industrial manufacturing, electricity and gas, commerce, hotel industry, government, real estate, education, healthcare and domestic services.

The Vallenato Legend Festival, has gained economic importance because of its impact in Valledupar&#x27;s economy. The Festival has become a destination for the tourist industry, and enables the promotion of other local products. The region&#x27;s contemporary arts and crafts, ecotourism and cuisine have contributed to a growing hospitality industry.

In 2006 during the Vallenato Legend Festival, the Federación Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia agreed to promote local coffee as one of their products, under the name &quot;Cafe Festival de la Leyenda Vallenata&quot; (Vallenato Legend Festival Coffee). This effort is to promote coffee produced by the local small and medium-sized farms from the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and the Serranía del Perijá.

Valledupar annually hosts one of the most important Cattle Fairs (Spanish: Ferias Ganaderas) in Colombia at the end of August. It is also an opportunity to feature other agricultural and domestic products.

== Culture ==

Valledupar&#x27;s cultural background comes from three different major cultures; African, European, and Amerindian. The creolization of these cultures developed into unique musical styles, such as in the vallenato and cumbia. Valledupar was established as a Spanish colonial town, where colonists tried to reimpose what they knew in terms of familiar customs, food, popular religion, music, dances and Castilian Spanish.

Many descendants from the colonial period were converted to Catholicism. At the same time, practices have absorbed aspects of Amerindian and African cultures, as Christianity is syncretic. The holy week, in April, is celebrated in much the same way as during colonial times; with fasting, church attendance and processions to venerate Jesus and the &quot;Santo Eccehomo&quot;. Corpus Christi is celebrated in July. In religious practices, Christians represent the majority of the population. There are a minority of Muslims.

Traditional oral storytelling has helped preserve stories, myths and legends, such as the popular &quot;legend of the guatapuri mermaid&quot;, or the &quot;silborcito&quot; (the nazarenian without a head), &quot;the Lerta&quot; (&quot;The duel between the devil and Francisco &#x27;the man&#x27;&quot;), &quot;the monitos&quot;, &quot;The llorona (the crying woman)&quot;, &quot;la madre monte (mother nature)&quot; &quot;la mano pelua (the hairy hand)&quot;, and &quot;el cuco&quot;, among other stories that are still alive. Storytellers are very common in the region, as well as traditional comedians. These storytellers, usually travelling farmers selling their cattle around the region, revived the already traditional Spanish &quot;juglares&quot; (minstrels). From village to village, they sang the news and stories from other towns, usually playing an instrument. This is how the Vallenato music was believed to be born.

Dances play a very important role in the cultural identity of this society, coming from the three different cultures that founded it, among this dances are: &quot;Tambora La Cumaná&quot; &quot;El Pilon Vallenato&quot; &quot;chicote kankuamo&quot; and &quot;Los Diablos danzantes de Corpus Christi&quot; (The Corpus Christi Dancing Devils). The latter originated in a colonial theater play, developed to represent the devil and good, in an effort to convert the Amerindians to Christianity.
Valledupar also celebrates a carnival in February, smaller but similar to Barranquilla&#x27;s Carnival. Carnival&#x27;s celebration of pagan traditions, and quickly helped the African and Amerindian traditions to become part of society.

Route 80 is still under-construction, a segment between the village of Badillo via the village of Patillal and the town of San Juan del Cesar in the department of La Guajira. As an alternative route 80 also crosses the town of La Paz in order to drive north to the northern department of La Guajira.

Valledupar&#x27;s land transportation terminal provides national and international services through sixteen different bus or van transportation companies. Four of whom make trips to rural areas of the municipality. In the urban area transportation services are provided by taxis, and by private and government bus companies covering the entire city by shared routes. Lately, a new form of transportation was born, informal Auto rickshaws (mototaxismo), taking illegally over the bus and taxi services, to a point that are making them go bankrupt. The local government is attempting to penalize the use of Auto rickshaw for safety reasons and are also operating illegally, but because there are so many and tend to violently protest, the issue became difficult. In 2014 the local government expects to introduce the new Massive Strategic Transportation System (&quot;Sistema Estrategico de Transporte Público&quot;, SETP) with new routes and more modern buses.

Valledupar is served by the Alfonso López Pumarejo Airport, that receives national and some charter flights.

<text>Runaway Brain is a 1995 American animated comedy horror short film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation. Featuring Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse, the short centers on Mickey attempting to earn money to pay for an anniversary gift for Minnie. He responds to an advertisement to work for Doctor Frankenollie, only to find out that he is looking for a donor to switch brains with the monster he created. Featuring animation by animator Andreas Deja, it was first released in 1995 attached to North American theatrical showings of &quot;A Kid in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot; and in 1996 attached to France UK and Spain theartrical showings of &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot;. It would be the final original &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; theatrical animated short until &quot;Get a Horse!&quot; in 2013.

Despite receiving mixed reviews from audiences, the short was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film at the 68th Academy Awards, which ultimately went to the Wallace and Gromit short &quot;A Close Shave &quot;. Later references to the cartoon have been made in Disney related media, such as the video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance&quot;.

==Plot==
On a dark and stormy evening, Minnie Mouse arrives at Mickey Mouse&#x27;s house to find him playing a &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; video game and becomes angry over Mickey having forgotten about the anniversary of their first date. Mickey then comes up with the last-minute idea to take her to a miniature golf course and shows her a newspaper ad for it, but she instead notices another ad for a trip to Hawaii, which costs $999.99, and misinterprets it for the gift. After Minnie leaves, Mickey panics over how he can make enough money for the trip when Pluto shows him the want ads and Mickey sees an ad from Doctor Frankenollie to earn the amount of money that he needs for &quot;a mindless day&#x27;s work&quot;. Upon arriving at Frankenollie&#x27;s residence, Mickey is dropped down a trapdoor into the scientist&#x27;s laboratory, where he reveals his plan to switch his donor&#x27;s brain with that of his enormous Pete-resembling monster, Julius. The experiment causes an explosion that takes Frankenollie&#x27;s life, but it is a success, nonetheless, as Mickey and Julius&#x27; brains are switched.

In his new body, Julius finds Mickey&#x27;s wallet and notices a photo of Minnie, with whom he instantly becomes smitten. He escapes from the laboratory and finds Minnie while she is shopping for swimsuits. After Minnie immediately mistakes Julius for Mickey, the latter arrives to save her, but Minnie becomes terrified of him due to the appearance of Julius&#x27; body and panics, until Mickey convinces her of who he is and places her on the top of a skyscraper for safety. As Julius continues to pursue Minnie and a battle between him and Mickey occurs, they land on a telephone line and become electrocuted, sending their brains back into their proper bodies. Continuing their fight at the skyscraper where Minnie is, Mickey manages to subdue Julius using a billboard advertising the trip to Hawaii there and save her. Mickey and Minnie eventually travel to Hawaii together on an inflatable boat pulled by Julius, who is goaded by Mickey into chasing after the photo of Minnie in his wallet.

==Voice cast==

* Russi Taylor as Minnie Mouse
* Kelsey Grammer as Doctor Frankenollie
* Jim Cummings as Julius
* Bill Farmer as Pluto

==Production==
After Disney celebrated Mickey Mouse&#x27;s 60th anniversary in 1988, Mickey starred in the featurette &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot;, which was directed by George Scribner and released in theaters with &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; in 1990. &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; however failed at the box office, so a new project was sought for the character. The director of &quot;Runaway Brain&quot;, Chris Bailey recalled: &quot;If you were a director or part of the development, if you were between assignments, you were asked to develop Mickey shorts&quot;. Bailey at first saw approval from studio president Jeffrey Katzenberg and Disney Animation executives Thomas Schumacher and Peter Schneider regarding the rework of an idea he had for a Roger Rabbit short, &quot;Tourist Trap&quot;, with Mickey and Donald Duck heading on a vacation and Donald attempting to kill Mickey, but after a failed storyboard screening, Bailey received permission from Roy E. Disney to develop another short idea, &quot;Runaway Brain&quot;.

Jim Beihold was assigned to layout, Ian Gooding served as art director, and Andreas Deja, who had animated Scar in &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994), developed the monstrous version of Mickey possessed by Julius based on Bailey&#x27;s sketches. Disney Animation France, who was just finishing &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; (1995), was given the animation job. While the crew was in France, Katzenberg left Disney, leaving Bailey without one of the executives who most supported his ideas. While the first screening of the mostly completed short to the executives was successful, Schumacher and Schneider went on to order many changes that would cut scenes and require others to be newly animated. These included not having the monstrous Mickey drooling, toning Mickey&#x27;s electrocution to be more cartoonish, and having the ending with Julius chasing an &quot;effigy Minnie&quot; made of pillows replaced with having him pursue the wallet picture.

==Cultural references==
The beginning of the cartoon shows Mickey playing a satirical take of fighting games such as the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; franchise and the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series, with Dopey and Queen Grimhilde in her peddler disguise from &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937) fighting each other. Director Chris Bailey said that Jeffrey Katzenberg was the one who suggested a scene with a video game, and Bailey came up with the fighting game after his idea of a first-person shooter based on &quot;Bambi&quot; (1942) was rejected. The general plot of the cartoon refers back to Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, with Doctor Frankenollie and Julius being heavily inspired by the titular character and his monster. The composite name &quot;Frankenollie&quot; comes from the names of animators Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, who were two of Disney&#x27;s Nine Old Men.

Mickey&#x27;s wallet contains a photo of him from &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; (1928). In addition, Mickey whistles the short&#x27;s primary theme, Steamboat Bill, before he is dropped down into Frankenollie&#x27;s laboratory and a Polynesian-styled rendition of it is also played in the credits. The wallet also features a library card from the fictional &#x27;Guillard County Library&#x27;, a reference to Stuart Gillard.

&quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973) is referenced in the shot where Mickey first arrives at Frankenollie&#x27;s residence, with the imagery mirroring Father Merrin&#x27;s arrival at Regan MacNeil&#x27;s house.

Zazu from &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994), which was released the year prior to &quot;Runaway Brain&quot;, briefly appears twice; once when Mickey is dropped down into the lab and again when Julius roars at him.

One of the objects seen during Mickey&#x27;s descent into the lab is a pink slip with &quot;J.K.&quot; on it. This is a reference to Katzenberg, who left Disney in 1994 and went on to form rival studio DreamWorks with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen.

==Release and reception==
In terms of general reception, the macabre nature of the animation&#x27;s plot brought criticism from some Disney fans due to the contrast with the previously light tone of Mickey Mouse cartoons. Andy Mooney, then chairman of Disney&#x27;s consumer products unit, remarked to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 2003 that &quot;the very fact that Mickey was possessed was very disturbing&quot; to some audiences, though the character &quot;overcomes that&quot;.

The film was screened out of competition at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival. It was first released in North America on August 11, 1995, alongside theatrical showings of &quot;A Kid in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot;, then on September 12, 1996, with &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; in Australia and on October 18, 1996, attached to &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; in the UK. The short was to be re-released with &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot;, which was sent to theaters with the short attached in 1996, but Disney asked theater owners to cut the short off all film prints and replace it with trailers for then upcoming Disney films. In addition, the short was released with theatrical screenings of &quot;George of the Jungle&quot; in 1997.

The cartoon was nominated the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film at the 68th Academy Awards, ending up losing to &quot;A Close Shave&quot; starring Wallace and Gromit.

==Home media==
The short was released on May 18, 2004 on &quot;Walt Disney Treasures: Mickey Mouse in Living Color, Volume Two: 1939-Today&quot;.

It is also available as a Movies Anywhere-exclusive digital download with the Walt Disney Animation Studios Short Films Collection (but is not included on the Blu-Ray/DVD disc set).

<doc id="666766" wikidata="Q1634035" url="?curid=666766" title="Jerusalem Law">
<text>Jerusalem Law (, ) is a common name of Basic Law: Jerusalem, Capital of Israel passed by the Knesset on 30 July 1980.

Although the law did not use the term, the Israeli Supreme Court interpreted the law as an effective annexation of East Jerusalem. The United Nations Security Council condemned the attempted change in status to Jerusalem and ruled the law &quot;null and void&quot; in United Nations Security Council Resolution 478.

== History ==
On 27 June 1967, Israel expanded the municipal boundaries of West Jerusalem so as to include approximately of West Bank territory today referred to as &quot;East Jerusalem&quot;, which included &quot;Jordanian East Jerusalem&quot; ( ) and 28 villages and areas of the Bethlehem and Beit Jala municipalities . On 30 July 1980, the Knesset officially approved the Jerusalem Law, which called the city the complete and united capital.

Although it was claimed that the application of the Israeli law to East Jerusalem was not annexation, this position was rejected by the Israeli Supreme Court. In a 1970 majority ruling, Justice Y. Kahan expressed the opinion:&quot;... As far as I am concerned, there is no need for any certificate from the Foreign Minister or from any administrative authority to determine that East Jerusalem ... was annexed to the State of Israel and constitutes part of its territory ... by means of these two enactments and consequently this area constitutes part of the territory of Israel.&quot;The Jerusalem Law began as a private member&#x27;s bill proposed by Geulah Cohen, whose original text stated that &quot;the integrity and unity of greater Jerusalem (Yerushalayim rabati) in its boundaries after the Six-Day War shall not be violated.&quot; However, this clause was dropped after the first reading in the Knesset. As the Knesset thus declined to specify boundaries and did not use the words &quot;annexation&quot; or &quot;sovereignty&quot;, Ian Lustick writes that &quot;The consensus of legal scholars is that this action added nothing to the legal or administrative circumstance of the city, although, especially at the time, its passage was considered to have political importance and sparked a vigorous protest reaction from the world community.&quot;

General Assembly Resolutions 2253 and 2254 of 4 and 14 July 1967, respectively, considered Israeli activity in Eastern Jerusalem illegal and asked Israel to cancel those activities and especially not to change the features of the city. On 21 May 1968, United Nations Security Council Resolution 252 invalidated legal and administrative measures by Israel in violation of UNGA Resolutions 2253 and 2254 and required those measures be rescinded. UN criticism since 1967 includes UNSC resolutions in addition to 252, 267 (1969), 298 (1971) and resolution 476 (1980), regretting changes in the characteristics of Jerusalem, and resolution 478 (1980), where UN Member States were asked to withdraw their embassies from the city. Resolution 478 also &quot;condemned in &quot;the strongest terms&quot; the enactment of Israeli law proclaiming a change in status of Jerusalem.&quot; while Resolution 2334 of 2016 condemned all Israeli settlements in occupied territory including East Jerusalem. However, thirty-eight years later the United States relocated their Israeli embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem on 14 May 2018, and other countries, including Paraguay and the Czech Republic expressed similar intentions.

Although the law was not proposed by the governing coalition or Prime Minister Menachem Begin, rather, it was proposed by lawmakers concerned that peace negotiators were demanding that Arab residents of East Jerusalem be given votes in Palestinian Authority elections. As legislation, the Act is regarded as largely symbolic. An amendment in 2000 further specified the jurisdiction of the law, that included East Jerusalem. It actually did not change its range. The amendment also prohibited transfer of authority to a foreign body, for example an international regime.

<doc id="666772" wikidata="Q2736774" url="?curid=666772" title="Queen Mab">
<text>Queen Mab is a fairy referred to in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, in which the character Mercutio famously describes her as &quot;the fairies&#x27; midwife&quot;, a miniature creature who rides her chariot (which is driven by a team of atom-sized creatures) over the bodies of sleeping humans during the nighttime, thus helping them &quot;give birth&quot; to their dreams. Later depictions in other poetry and literature and various guises in drama and cinema have typically portrayed her as the Queen of the Fairies.

== Origin ==
Shakespeare may have borrowed the character of Mab from folklore, but this is debated and there have been numerous theories on the origin of the name. A popular theory holds that Mab derives from Medb (pronounced &quot;Maive&quot;), a legendary queen from 12th-century Irish poetry; scholar Gillian Edwards notes &quot;little resemblance&quot;, however, between the two characters. There is marked contrast between the formidable warrior Medb and the tiny dream-bringer Mab.

Other authors such as Wirt Sikes argued that Mab comes from the Welsh &quot;mab&quot; (&quot;child&quot; or &quot;son&quot;), although critics noted the lack of supporting evidence. Thomas Keightley suggested a connection to Habundia or Dame Habonde, a goddess associated with witches in medieval times and sometimes described as a queen.

A more likely origin for Mab&#x27;s name would be from Mabel and the Middle English derivative &quot;Mabily&quot; (as used by Chaucer) all from the Latin &quot;amabilis&quot; (&quot;lovable&quot;). Simon Young contends that this fits in with fairy names in British literature of the time, which tended to be generic and monosyllabic. &quot;Mab&quot; was a nickname for a low-class woman or prostitute, or possibly for a haglike witch. Similarly, &quot;queen&quot; is a pun on &quot;quean&quot;, a term for a prostitute.

== Mercutio&#x27;s speech ==

&quot;O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. &lt;br&gt;
She is the fairies&#x27; midwife, and she comes &lt;br&gt;
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone &lt;br&gt;
On the fore-finger of an alderman, &lt;br&gt;
Drawn with a team of little atomies &lt;br&gt;
Athwart men&#x27;s noses as they lie asleep; &lt;br&gt;
Her wagon-spokes made of long spinners&#x27; legs,&lt;br&gt;
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers, &lt;br&gt;
The traces of the smallest spider&#x27;s web, &lt;br&gt;
The collars of the moonshine&#x27;s wat&#x27;ry beams, &lt;br&gt;
Her whip of cricket&#x27;s bone; the lash of film; &lt;br&gt;
Her waggoner a small grey-coated gnat, &lt;br&gt;
Not half so big as a round little worm &lt;br&gt;
Pricked from the lazy finger of a maid:&lt;br&gt;
Her chariot is an empty hazelnut &lt;br&gt;
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,&lt;br&gt;
Time out o&#x27; mind the fairies&#x27; coachmakers. &lt;br&gt;
And in this state she gallops night by night &lt;br&gt;
Through lovers&#x27; brains, and then they dream of love;&lt;br&gt;
O&#x27;er courtiers&#x27; knees, that dream on court&#x27;sies straight,&lt;br&gt;
O&#x27;er lawyers&#x27; fingers, who straight dream on fees,&lt;br&gt;
O&#x27;er ladies&#x27; lips, who straight on kisses dream, &lt;br&gt;
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, &lt;br&gt;
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are: &lt;br&gt;
Sometime she gallops o&#x27;er a courtier&#x27;s nose, &lt;br&gt;
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit; &lt;br&gt;
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig&#x27;s tail &lt;br&gt;
Tickling a parson&#x27;s nose as a&#x27; lies asleep, &lt;br&gt;
Then dreams he of another benefice: &lt;br&gt;
Sometime she driveth o&#x27;er a soldier&#x27;s neck,&lt;br&gt;
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, &lt;br&gt;
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades, &lt;br&gt;
Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon &lt;br&gt;
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,&lt;br&gt;
And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two&lt;br&gt;
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab &lt;br&gt;
That plaits the manes of horses in the night,&lt;br&gt;
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs, &lt;br&gt;
Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes: &lt;br&gt;
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, &lt;br&gt;
That presses them and learns them first to bear, &lt;br&gt;
Making them women of good carriage: &lt;br&gt;
This is she—&quot;

— Mercutio in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, Act I, scene IV
== In other works ==
Since then, Queen Mab re-appears in works:
* Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;The Entertainment at Althorp&quot; (1603)
* Michael Drayton&#x27;s &quot;Nymphidia&quot; (1627)
* In Poole&#x27;s work &quot;Parnassus&quot; (1657), Mab is described as the Queen of the Fairies and consort to Oberon, emperor of the Fairies.
* 1750 pantomime by actor Henry Woodward,
* &quot;Queen Mab&quot; (1813), the first large poetic work written by Percy Bysshe Shelley
* The composer Hector Berlioz wrote a &quot;Queen Mab&quot; scherzo in his &quot;Romeo et Juliette&quot; symphony (1839). Hugh Macdonald describes this piece as &quot;Berlioz&#x27;s supreme exercise in light orchestral texture, a brilliant, gossamer fabric, prestissimo and pianissimo almost without pause... The pace and fascination of the movement are irresistible; it is some of the most ethereally brilliant music ever penned.&quot;
* Charles Gounod&#x27;s 1867 opera &quot;Romeo et Juliette&quot; includes a song about Queen Mab sung by the character Mercutio.
* In the 1998 television miniseries &quot;Merlin&quot;, Queen Mab (Miranda Richardson) has been inserted into Arthurian legend as the primary antagonist, but is preserved as a ruler of fairies, pixies, goblins and a belief system referred to as &#x27;the old ways&#x27;, in opposition to the introduction of Christianity by recent Roman influences. Mab is responsible for the creation of the half-human wizard Merlin and influences the conception of Mordred, Arthur&#x27;s illegitimate son and her protegé.
* In &quot;The Dresden Files&quot; &quot;Summer Knight&quot; (2002) by Jim Butcher, Mab appears as the Queen of the Unseelie Court, also known as the Queen of Air and Darkness and ruler of the Winter Fae.
* &quot;Under the Pendulum Sun&quot; (2017) by Jeannette Ng has Mab as queen of the fae.

<text>Trinity International University (TIU) is an evangelical Christian university headquartered in Bannockburn, Illinois. It comprises Trinity College, a theological seminary (Trinity Evangelical Divinity School), a law school (Trinity Law School which is located in Santa Ana, California). The university also maintains campuses in North Lauderdale, Florida and Miami, Florida. TIU is the only university affiliated with Evangelical Free Church of America in the United States and enrolls 1,242 students. On February 17, 2023, TIU announced it was moving the undergraduate program to online modalities only and closed the residential campus at the end of the Spring 2023 semester. The online undergraduate program is ending at the end of the Spring 2024 semester.

== History ==
Tracing its roots to 1897, TIU formed in the late 1940s as the result of a merger of two schools:

*A school run by the Swedish Evangelical Free Church, founded in 1897 in Chicago, and incorporated as the Swedish Bible Institute of Chicago, then affiliated with Moody Bible Institute as the Swedish Department until 1925 when it became the Swedish Evangelical Free Church Bible Institute and Seminary.
*A three-year Bible school, the Norwegian-Danish Bible Institute and Academy, founded in 1910 by the Norwegian-Danish Free Church, established in Rushford, Minnesota and later moving to Minneapolis and becoming Trinity Seminary and Bible Institute.

By 1949, the Minneapolis-based school moved to Chicago and the unified schools became known as Trinity Seminary and Bible College. In 1961 the school moved to a new campus in Bannockburn, Illinois, in Bannockburn, Illinois and a year later was renamed Trinity Evangelical Divinity School (TEDS) and Trinity College. The school grew from an enrollment of 51 in 1961 to 1,400 in 1990. In 1995, TEDS became part of Trinity International University, along with Trinity College in Deerfield, Illinois, and Trinity College in Miami, (formerly Miami Christian College which was obtained through a merger of the two institutions). In 1997 Trinity Law School, located in Santa Ana, California, was incorporated into Trinity International University, and the Trinity Graduate School was founded.

In 2014, David S. Dockery was elected unanimously as the 15th president of Trinity. He was inaugurated in October of that year. Nicholas Perrin was elected as the 16th president in June 2019. Kevin Kompelien succeeded Perrin as president on April 1, 2024. 

Trinity Graduate School closed in 2024, along with the academic programs at TIU-Florida. Trinity College Online will close in May 2025. The undergraduate program for prisoners in Fox Lake, Wisconsin remains open. Trinity Evangelical Divinity School and Trinity Law School are operational.

== Approvals, accreditations and memberships ==
Trinity International University is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. The divinity school is also programmatically accredited by the Commission on Accrediting of the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada (ATS).

TIU&#x27;s law school, located in Santa Ana, California, is accredited by the Committee of Bar Examiners (CBE) of the State Bar of California (CALBAR). The normative nationwide USDE- and CHEA-approved accreditor of law schools is the American Bar Association (ABA). Within the state of California, though, law schools are also accredited by CALBAR CBE, which is neither USDE- or CHEA-approved. Graduates of non-ABA accredited program are not recognized outside of the state of California. TIU&#x27;s Trinity Law School (Santa Ana campus only) is also included as part of TIU&#x27;s regional accreditation by the USDE- and CHEA-approved NCA-HLC.

Trinity International University is exempt from the need to be approved to operate in Illinois by the Illinois Board of Higher Education (IBHE), which lists it as a &quot;private NFP (not-for-profit) institution&quot;. Its educational programs for K-12 teachers are approved by the Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) so that TIU&#x27;s graduates from said programs may obtain state-issued teaching credentials. TIU is, further, approved by the Illinois Student Assistance Commission (ISAC) (formerly the Illinois State Scholarship Commission (ISSC)) Monetary Award Program (MAP) so that TIU&#x27;s students may receive Illinois educational grants and scholarships.

Prior to 2003, TIU&#x27;s athletic trainer program was accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP); however in 2003 the accreditation of such programs was taken over by the Joint Review Committee on Athletic Training (JRC-AT); and in 2006 JRC-AT became the Committee for Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE). TIU&#x27;s undergraduate athletic training educational program claims CAATE accreditation on its website.

TIU is also a member of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities (CCCU), the Christian College Consortium (CCC), and the Christian Adult Higher Education Association (CAHEA).

==Athletics==
The Trinity International athletic teams were called the Trojans. Prior to the move to an all-online undergraduate academic format in 2023, the university was a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Chicagoland Collegiate Athletic Conference (CCAC) for most of its sports from 1996–97 until its move after 2022–23; while its football program competed in the Mideast League of the Mid-States Football Association (MSFA). They were also a member of the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA), primarily competing as an independent in the North Central Region of the Division I level.

Trinity International competed in nine intercollegiate varsity sports. Men&#x27;s sports included baseball, basketball, football, soccer and volleyball. Women&#x27;s sports included basketball, soccer, softball and volleyball.

===Accomplishments===
In 2022, women’s volleyball claimed the NCCAA D1 National Championship, making the title a program first and last.
