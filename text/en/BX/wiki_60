<text>The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art is an art museum in Kansas City, Missouri, known for its encyclopedic collection of art from nearly every continent and culture, and especially for its extensive collection of Asian art.

In 2007, &quot;Time&quot; magazine ranked the museum&#x27;s new Bloch Building number one on its list of &quot;The 10 Best (New and Upcoming) Architectural Marvels&quot; which considered candidates from around the globe.

The museum is open five days a week: Monday from 10 am-5 pm, closed Tuesday and Wednesday, open Thursday 10-9, Friday 10-9, Saturday and Sunday 10-5. 
Admission is free.

==History==

The museum was built on the grounds of Oak Hall, the home of &quot;Kansas City Star&quot; publisher William Rockhill Nelson (1841–1915). When he died in 1915, his will provided that upon the deaths of his wife and daughter, the proceeds of his entire estate would go to purchasing artwork for public enjoyment. This bequest was augmented by additional funds from the estates of Nelson&#x27;s daughter, son-in-law and attorney.

In 1911, former schoolteacher Mary McAfee Atkins (1836–1911), widow of real estate speculator James Burris Atkins, bequeathed $300,000 to establish an art museum. Through sound management of the estate and a booming economy, this amount grew to $700,000 by 1927. Original plans called for two art museums based on the separate bequests (with the Atkins Museum to be located in Penn Valley Park). However, trustees of the two estates decided to combine the two bequests along with smaller bequests from others to make a single major art institution.

The building was designed by prominent Kansas City architects Wight and Wight, who also designed the approaches to the Liberty Memorial and the Kansas governor&#x27;s mansion, Cedar Crest. Ground was broken in July 1930, and the museum opened December 11, 1933. The building&#x27;s classical Beaux-Arts architecture style was modeled on the Cleveland Museum of Art. Thomas Wight, the brother who did most of the design work for the building said:

We are building the museum on classic principles because they have been proved by the centuries. A distinctly American principle appropriate for such a building may be developed, but, so far, everything of that kind is experimental. One doesn&#x27;t experiment with two-and-a-half million dollars.

When the original building opened, its final cost was $2.75 million (about $54 million in 2018). The dimensions of the six-story structure were long by wide, making it larger than the Cleveland Museum of Art.

The museum, which was locally referred to as the Nelson Art Gallery or simply the Nelson Gallery, was actually two museums until 1983 when it was formally named the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art. Previously the east wing was called the Atkins Museum of Fine Arts, while the west wing and lobby was called the William Rockhill Nelson Gallery of Art.

On the exterior of the building Charles Keck created 23 limestone panels depicting the march of civilization from east to west including wagon trains heading west from Westport Landing. Grillwork in the doors depict oak leaf motifs in memory of Oak Hall. The south facade of the museum is an iconic structure in Kansas City that looms over a series of terraces onto Brush Creek.

About the same time as the construction of the museum, Howard Vanderslice donated to the west of the museum, across Oak Street, for the Kansas City Art Institute, which moved from the Deardorf Building at 11th and Main streets in downtown Kansas City.

As William Nelson, the major contributor, donated money rather than a personal art collection, the curators were able to assemble a collection from scratch. At the height of the Great Depression, the worldwide art market was flooded with pieces for sale, but there were very few buyers. As such, the museum&#x27;s buyers found a vast market open to them. The acquisitions grew quickly and within a short time, the Nelson-Atkins had one of the largest art collections in the country.

One of the original components of the building was a re-creation of Nelson&#x27;s oak paneled room from Oak Hall (and namesake of the estate). The room contained Nelson&#x27;s red plush easy chair and bookcases. The room was dismantled in 1988 to make way for a photography studio.

One-third of the building on the first and second floors of the west wing were left unfinished when the building opened to allow for future expansion. Part was completed in 1941 to house Chinese painting and the remainder of the building was completed after World War II. In 1993 Michael Churchman wrote a history of The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, &quot;High Ideals and Aspirations&quot;.

=== Directors ===

==== Paul Gardner, 1933–1953 ====
The museum had four Directors before Julián Zugazagoitia&#x27;s appointment in 2010; the first was Paul Gardner (1894–1972). A native of Massachusetts, Gardner graduated from MIT in 1917 with a degree in architecture. He served with distinction in WWI, after which he traveled in Europe and North Africa for a year. In about 1919 he became a dancer with Anna Pavlova&#x27;s Ballet Company under the name Paul Tchernikoff. Gardner eventually went back to graduate school, earning a master&#x27;s in European history from George Washington University in 1928 and then enrolling in the doctoral program in art history at Harvard. In March 1932 the cautious Trustees of the Nelson Art Gallery, hesitant about naming a full-fledged Director, appointed the graduate student as their assistant on a trial basis. Gardner took to the new position at once, and so was named by the Trustees as Director eighteen months later, on September 1, 1933. He would serve for the next twenty years.

Gardiner served in the US Army during the Italian campaign of World War II in the rank of major. He was appointed head of the Fine Arts and Education Department of the Allied Military Government in occupied Italy.

====Ethylene Jackson, 1942–1945====
Ethylene Jackson (1907–1993), Paul Gardner&#x27;s executive secretary since 1933, became acting director in November 1942 when Gardner was commissioned a major in the United States Army. Besides her role as executive secretary to the Director, Jackson had served as curator of the decorative arts collection. Paul Gardner served as a Monuments Man in Europe, returning to the Nelson in December 1945. Ethylene Jackson left Kansas City for New York City the following year after marrying art dealer Germain Seligman.

==== Laurence Sickman, 1953–1977 ====
Upon Paul Gardner&#x27;s retirement on May 1, 1953, Laurence Sickman (1907–1988) became the Gallery&#x27;s second Director. He had been associated with the Gallery since 1931.

Laurence Sickman, a native of Denver, Colorado, had become interested in Japanese and Chinese art as a high school student. After two years at the University of Colorado he transferred to Harvard, where he studied with Langdon Warner. He also became fluent in Chinese. After graduating with a B.A. in 1930 Sickman traveled to China on a Harvard-Yenching scholarship. There he reconnected with Warner, who was by then in China, under assignment to buy art for the museum Trustees. Warner recommended to the Trustees that the young graduate student assume the responsibility of negotiating art purchases for the Gallery, as Warner was moving to Japan. Sickman&#x27;s acumen as a collector earned him the respect of the Trustees, who sent him thousands of dollars with which to buy art. Since he was on a scholarship, his expertise cost the Trustees nothing. He made the 6,000-mile journey to Kansas City in December 1933 for the opening of the Gallery, then returned to China. Returning once more to the United States, he was made the Gallery&#x27;s Curator of Oriental Art in 1935. By 1941, Sickman&#x27;s purchases of Chinese art had given the Nelson Gallery one of the best Asian collections in the United States.

Sickman, like Paul Gardner, was commissioned as an officer in the United States Army as a member of the Monuments Men, serving from 1942 to 1945 in England, India, and China. In his absence, his very capable assistant, Miss Lindsay Hughes, was appointed acting Curator. Sickman returned to his curatorial role after the war; eight years later he was named Director. Among the many successes of his tenure, the most important was the major exhibition &quot;Archaeological Finds of the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot;, which ran from April 20-June 8, 1975 and attracted about 280,000 visitors. The exhibition of 385 pieces was a result of the détente between the United States and Communist China that Richard Nixon&#x27;s 1972 trip to that country had begun. This was a professional and personal coup for Sickman: his reputation as a scholar and the collection he had built at the Nelson Gallery made Kansas City one of only four cities the exhibition would visit, after Paris, Toronto, and Washington, D.C. Laurence Sickman retired on January 31, 1977, and was named Director Emeritus and advisor to the Trustees.

==== Ted Coe, 1977–1982 ====
On Laurence Sickman&#x27;s retirement, Ralph Tracy &quot;Ted&quot; Coe (1929–2010) became the Gallery&#x27;s third Director. Coe was a native of Cleveland, where his father, a steel manufacturer, was an art collector. The recipient of a bachelor&#x27;s degree in art history from Oberlin College and a master&#x27;s in architecture from Yale, he had worked at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the National Gallery in Washington, D.C. before coming to the Nelson Gallery in 1959 as Curator of Painting and Sculpture. While a curator, Coe organized several large and well-attended special exhibitions. The most influential was &quot;Sacred Circles&quot;, an exhibition of 900 Native American art objects. Organized to commemorate the American Bicentennial, the show opened at the Hayward Gallery in London, England, running from October 1976 to January 1977. Financial support was quickly organized in Kansas City to make the Nelson Gallery the only American venue. &quot;Sacred Circles&quot; was the second most popular exhibition after the Chinese show of 1975, running from April 16-June 19, 1977, and drawing more than 245,000 visitors. Ted Coe requested a sabbatical from his duties as Director in March 1982 and resigned at the end of June, having worked at the Nelson for 23 years, including years as Director.

==== Marc Wilson, 1982–2010 ====
Ted Coe was succeeded by Marc Wilson, who served from 1982 to 2010.

==== Julián Zugazagoitia, 2010– ====
On September 1, 2010, Julián Zugazagoitia (b. 1964) became the museum&#x27;s fifth Director. Zugazagoitia had previously served for seven years as the Director and CEO of El Museo del Barrio in New York City.

===Bloch Building Addition===

In 1993, the museum began to consider the first expansion plans since the completion of the unfinished areas in the 1940s. Plans called for a 55 percent increase in space and were finalized in 1999.

Architect Steven Holl won an international competition in 1999 for the design of the addition. Holl&#x27;s concept, conceived and realized with Design Partner Chris McVoy, was to build five glass pavilions to the east of the original building which they call lenses. The lenses top a underground building known as the Bloch Building. It is named after the H&amp;R Block co-founder Henry W. Bloch. The Bloch building houses the museum&#x27;s contemporary, African, photography, and special exhibitions galleries as well a new cafe, the museum&#x27;s Spencer Art Reference Library, and the Isamu Noguchi Sculpture Court. The addition cost approximately $95 million and opened June 9, 2007. It was part of $200 million in renovations to the museum that included the Ford Learning Center which is home to classes, workshops, and resources for students and educators. It opened in fall of 2005.

In the competition to design the addition, all the entrants except Holl proposed creating a modern addition on the north side of the museum which would have drastically altered or obscured the north facade which served as the main entrance to the museum. Instead Holl and McVoy proposed placing the addition on the east side perpendicular to the main building. Their aim was to engage the museum&#x27;s iconic sculpture garden to fuse the experience of art, architecture and landscape. Their lenses now cascade down the east perimeter of the grounds.

During construction, Holl&#x27;s plan met with considerable controversy. It was described as &quot;grotesque, a metal box&quot;. However, reviews of the new structure once completed have generally been raves:

&quot;New York Times&quot; architecture critic Nicolai Ouroussoff gives this description:

For the art world, the addition, known as the Bloch Building, should reaffirm that art and architecture can happily coexist. The rest of us can draw comfort from the fact that public works of our own day and age can equal or surpass the grand achievements of past generations ...
The result is a building that doesn&#x27;t challenge the past so much as suggest an alternate world view that is in constant shift. Seen from the north plaza, the addition&#x27;s main entrance gently defers to the old building, the crystalline form suggesting a ghostlike echo of the austere stone facade. From there, the eye is drawn to the distinct yet interconnected translucent blocks, which are partly buried in the landscape ...
It&#x27;s an approach that should be studied by anyone who sets out to design a museum from this point forward.

The museum has gone against traditional conservatorial thinking in allowing natural light from the lenses to illuminate its art work. Most of the exhibits in the addition are below ground with the 27 to glass pavilions above them. Officials say that advances in glass technology have allowed them to block most of the harmful ultraviolet rays that could damage the exhibited works.

The custom glass planks were manufactured by Glasfabrik Lamberts and imported by Bendheim Wall Systems.

Admission to the museum is free every day and visitors may use any of seven entrances to access the building. The main visitor&#x27;s desk is in the Bloch Building. On the north side of the museum, a reflecting pool now occupies part of the J.C. Nichols Plaza on the north facade and contains 34 &quot;oculi&quot; to provide natural light into the parking garage below. The casting of &quot;The Thinker&quot; which occupied this space prior to the renovations has been relocated to south of the museum.

In 2013, the combination of Steven Holl Architects and BNIM was selected to build a $100 million addition to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts that will be modeled somewhat on the Bloch Addition.

==Collections==

=== Ancient ===
With works from the ancient world, this includes locations like: Egypt, Greece, Rome, and Near Eastern. The gallery opened in 2010, led by Robert Cohon as curator. Portraits of pharaohs and Egyptian queens like Sen-useret III, Ramses II, Nefert-iti, the Ptolemy Dynasty are the most notable in the Egyptian collection. Near Eastern works includes jewelry from the early of kings and queens at Ur and sculptures from the 1st-millennium B.C.E. Palace of Ashurnasirpal II in Nimrud and the ceremonial center of the Persian Empire, Persepolis. Greek works are mostly statues and pottery from the 5th to 1st century B.C.E. of the Greek deities and heroes like Helios, Apollo, Demeter, Achilles, and Heracles. Roman statues of the emperors Alexander Severus and Hadrian, with other Roman works from early Christian period (4th to 7th century A.D) among them is a limestone sculpture of Thecla, the first female catholic martyr.

During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the museum made a virtual tour of their Queen Nefertari gallery with Julián Zugazagoitia acting as tour guide. The video was organized by the Nelson-Atkins, Pointe-à-Callière, and National Geographic Society. The exhibit is on Nefertari, called &quot;The One For Whom The Sun Shines&quot; by her husband Pharaoh Ramesses II, with 230 pieces of art on Nefertari and other woman of ancient Egypt. &quot;It will be thrilling to have these ancient works of art in our midst, to imagine the hands that created them and the importance these objects played in Egyptian culture. What a privilege to welcome objects from one of the most significant archaeological sites in Egypt – the Valley of the Queens,&quot; said Julián Zugazagoitia

=== European ===
The museum&#x27;s European painting collection is highly prized. It includes works by Caravaggio, Jusepe de Ribera, Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin, Petrus Christus, Gustave Courbet, El Greco, Giambattista Pittoni, Guercino, Alessandro Magnasco, Giuseppe Bazzani, Corrado Giaquinto, Cavaliere d&#x27;Arpino, Gaspare Traversi, Giuliano Bugiardini, Titian, Hieronymus Bosch, Rembrandt, Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun, Peter Paul Rubens, Eugène Fromentin, Gustave Caillebotte, Edgar Degas, Paul Gauguin, Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro, Vincent van Gogh.

In early 2016, &quot;The Temptation of St. Anthony&quot;, a small panel long attributed to the workshop of Hieronymus Bosch, was credited to the painter himself after forensic investigation of its underpainting. It was added to the ranks of only 25 authenticated Bosch paintings in the world. The Nelson-Atkins also has fine Late Gothic and Early Italian Renaissance paintings by Jacopo del Casentino (&quot;The Presentation of Christ in the Temple&quot;), Giovanni di Paolo and Workshop, Bernardo Daddi and Workshop, Lorenzo Monaco, Gherardo Starnina (&quot;The Adoration of the Magi&quot;), and Lorenzo di Credi. It has German and Austrian Expressionist paintings by Max Beckmann, Karl Hofer (&quot;Record Player&quot;), Emil Nolde, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and Oskar Kokoschka (&quot;Pyramids of Egypt&quot;).

Nelson Atkins has worked with Nazi-era art pieces that are often made by Jewish, Romani, queer, or otherwise against the nazi ideal in the 1920-40s though mostly focuses on art made and owned by Jewish people. Many pieces were either destroyed, rescued, or sold for cheap. They work on researching pieces and working with the descendants of the owners or artists. Depending on the descendants’ wishes, the pieces are either returned or allowed to stay on display. One of the most famous nazi-era pieces is a still life, Les Boules de Neige, by Pierre Bonnard, which was held in the Altaussee salt mine and taken from the French banker David David-Weill. The museum has a list of their works held on their website and the American Alliance of Museums&#x27; Nazi-Era Provenance Internet Portal (NEPIP).

=== Asian ===
The museum is distinguished and widely celebrated for its extensive collection of Asian art, especially that of Imperial China, as well as pieces from Afghanistan, India, Iran, Indonesia, Korea, Pakistan, and other Southeast/ South Asia. Most of it was purchased for the museum in the early 20th century by Laurence Sickman, then a Harvard fellow in China. The museum has one of the best collections of Chinese antique furniture in the country, including one of the celebrated group of glazed pottery luohans from Yixian (c. 1000).

In addition to Chinese art, the collection includes pieces from Japan, including screen and scroll pieces by Kaihō Yūshō, Tawaraya Sōtatsu, Ikeno Taiga, and Shiokawa Bunrin. The collection of woodblock pieces numbers around 500 with works by Katsushika Hokusai and Utagawa Hiroshige in it. The collection also includes sculpture, ceramics, and textile works.

=== African ===

Most of the artworks in the museum&#x27;s African collection were created by artists largely from West and Central Africa, primarily the countries of Mali, Cote d&#x27;Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Museum has a small collection from East and South Africa, including a mask carved by a Yao artist from Tanzania and beaded capes created by Zulu artists in the country of South Africa.

The Nelson-Atkins began collecting African art in the 1930s, with many notable acquisitions including two 17th-century cast brass objects from the Benin Kingdom in Nigeria in 1958. While the collection grew slowly until 1983, subsequent years saw more aggressive acquisitions. In 2012, African art gallery curator Nii Quarcoopome worked to add more content and ways for audiences to interact by including videos and photographs showing visitors how objects are used in ceremonies or everyday life. It includes 400 objects made from wood, brass, bead, terracotta, ivory and natural fibers. They have a variety of different cultures and tradition inside of the art world of the continent. These include a royal stool from the Asante people, a Standing Male Figure by a Hemba artist, a group of Kuba textiles, a Royal Beaded Throne created by a Bansoa artist in the Bamileke kingdom, a Female Mask (Kifwebe) by Songye artists, and a shrine figure carved by a Baga artist. 
The museum held an exhibit called &#x27;Through African Eyes: The European in African Art, 1500–Present&#x27; from September 25, 2010 - January 9, 2011. It was an examination of how African artists expressed the dynamic interactions between African cultures and Europeans and Westerners with 95 art pieces that reflect the theme from European colonization settlements in Africa, through the contemporary years of post-independence. Nii Quarcoopome was quoted as saying, &quot;At the heart of the exhibition and its accompanying catalogue is the desire to give agency to African voices; indeed, the title, &quot;Through African Eyes&quot;, primarily obtains from this thinking. After all, what good is African art and history without the African voice?&quot;. This exhibition has been organized by the Detroit Institute of Arts were the exhibit first appeared. With support provided by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts. In Kansas City the exhibition is supported by The Helzberg Fund for African Art. The museum has also held a talk in February 2018, discussing and educating the audience on Palbo Picasso and his relationship with the arts of Africa and the world, as he bought African art from shady art dealers. The speakers included Julián Zugazagoitia, director and exhibition curator at Nelson Atkins, and art historian Peter Stepan who wrote a book on the subject.

=== Native American ===
In 2009, the museum opened a suite of Native American art galleries, totaling 6,100 square feet, among the largest such displays in a comprehensive art museum with 200 pieces on display on average. Gaylord Torrence, the curator at the time of the Native American department, was able to acquire a majority of items with donations from Morton Sosland and other people. He helped find works from thousands of years old to modern Native American artists. Torrence has since retired. He went on to write &quot;Continuum: Native North American Art at The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art.&quot; David Penney, associate director for museum research and scholarship at the National Museum of the American Indian has praised Torrence&#x27;s work by saying “The Nelson&#x27;s collection reflects a combination of history, age, formal characteristics that play to modernist connoisseurship, and a notion of spirituality. Those are the kinds of things that Gaylord values.”

The gallery includes work by Jamie Okuma, Roxanne Swentzell, Diego Romero, Joyce Growing Thunder Fogarty, Silver Horn and Butch Thunder Hawk. It also houses historical pieces like pottery, baskets, bead/quill/textile works, and paintings from the Arikara, Mississippian, Algonquian, Plains, Lakota, Kiowa, Cheyenne, Chumash, Navajo, and Pueblo tribes. The Nelson Atkins has worked through the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) in collaboration with groups, tribes, and other forms of Native American communities to make to either repatriate or show Native American art in a cultural appropriate manner. Items that are claimed by an authority of the tribe are considered case by case, depending on the item&#x27;s connection to a certain culture as well as what the Deputy Director of Curatorial Affairs, the Director/CEO, and the Trustee Members of the Committee decide is best for the item&#x27;s future. Most repatriated items are related to grave sites or other cultural ceremonies.

The museum also hosts cultural performances as a way share and celebrate Indigenous cultures, mostly from the Midwest area. It includes singing, dancing, storytelling, and artwork from students of Haskell Indian Nations University and members of the Apache Indian Reservation, Plains Indians, Prairie Band Potawatomi, and Standing Rock Lakota, and various members of the Kansas City Indian Center.

=== American ===
The American gallery contains art from American artists who aren&#x27;t Native American. The collection includes the largest public collection of works by Thomas Hart Benton, who lived in Kansas City. Among its collection are paintings by George Bellows, George Caleb Bingham, Frederic Church, John Singleton Copley, Thomas Eakins, Winslow Homer, and John Singer Sargent. One of the more notable exhibits hosted was 30 Americans, which showed African American life through the eyes of 30 different artists from all over the country, including works from Jean-Michel Basquiat, Carrie Mae Weems, Kerry James Marshall, Mickalene Thomas, Rashid Johnson, Kara Walker, Hank Willis Thomas, and Kehinde Wiley. It contained 80 paintings, drawings, prints, sculptures, photographs, and videos.

The museum also has contemporary work in the Bloch Building by Willem de Kooning, Fairfield Porter, Wayne Thiebaud, Richard Diebenkorn, Agnes Martin, Bridget Riley, and Alfred Jensen.

In 2023, the museum won the painting &quot;Sailing&quot; by Thomas Eakins from a bet made by the Philadelphia Museum of Art after the Kansas City Chiefs won the Super Bowl against the Philadelphia Eagles

=== Modern ===
This collection covers artistic work produced from the 1860s -1970s, including work of Cubism, Expressionism, Fauvism, Dada, Surrealism, Bauhaus and Abstract Expressionism. Pieces include works from Pablo Picasso, Jackson Pollock, Ernst Barlach, Max Beckmann, Joseph Cornell, Juan Gris, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Paul Klee, Jacques Lipchitz, Roberto Matta Echaurren, Joan Miró, Ben Nicholson, Emil Nolde, Yves Tanguy, Willem de Kooning, Philip Guston, Grace Hartigan, Robert Motherwell, Constantin Brancusi, Alexander Calder, Alberto Giacometti, Henry Moore, Marcel Duchamp, Adolph Gottlieb, and Man Ray. The museum has thanked the Friends of Art group in Kansas City, the Hall Family Foundation, donations from other individuals, and companies (like Commerce Bank and Trust) for helping to acquire the art.

=== Photography ===
The Photography galleries in the Bloch Building display a survey of the creative history of the medium from daguerreotypes to 21st-century processes. New installations are presented about three times a year. The museum also houses the oldest known photo of slaves in the US, taken in 1850 by an unknown artist and is believed to have been taken in Georgia.

In 2006, Hallmark Cards chairman Donald J. Hall, Sr. donated to the museum the entire Hallmark Photographic Collection, spanning the history of photography from 1839 to the present day. It is primarily American in focus, and includes works from photographers such as Southworth &amp; Hawes, Carleton Watkins, Timothy O&#x27;Sullivan, Alvin Langdon Coburn, Alfred Stieglitz, Dorothea Lange, Homer Page, Harry Callahan, Lee Friedlander, Andy Warhol, Todd Webb, and Cindy Sherman, among others.

=== Contemporary ===
Contemporary art is located in the Bloch building and is defined in Nelson-Atkins as art from 1960 to present day. Styles include Pop, Minimalism, Conceptual and Realism, from different parts of the world and cultures. Art pieces are either gifts from The William T. Kemper Collecting Initiative or acquired or donated by famous artists like: Jackson Pollock, Andy Warhol, Anish Kapoor, Robert Rauschenberg, Yinka Shonibare, Duane Hansen, Louise Nevelson, Donald Judd, Robert Arneson, Jim Dine, Nancy Graves, Bridget Riley, Elizabeth Murray, Robert Mangold, Kerry James Marshall, El Anatsui, Raqib Shaw, Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko, David Smith, Richard Diebenkorn, Richard Estes, Duane Hanson, Claes Oldenburg, Sol LeWitt, Agnes Martin, Bridget Riley, Ronnie Landfield, Martin Puryear, and Deborah Butterfield

The Noguchi Sculpture Court houses contemporary sculptures that were gifted by the Hall Family Foundation&#x27;s Modern Sculpture Initiative. At the south end of the Bloch Building, this is the third largest collection of Isamu Noguchi, outside of New York and Japan.

=== Design and decorative arts ===
Ranging from medieval stained glass to 21st-century furniture from Kansas City artists, the museum houses pieces of architecture and decorative arts. Some significant pieces are an armor set for both a knight and his horse from 16th-century Italy and more than 1,300 examples of English pottery in the Burnap Collection. Works made during the 18th century form the larger concentration, including pottery, porcelain, silver, furniture. Donations from the Folgers Coffee Corporation and the Wallenstein family add other media to the understanding of 18th-century art and culture. Outside of 18th century art is the collection of 19th-21st century works. Includes many design movements, including the Art Nouveau, Bauhaus, to works produced today. Recent acquisitions have furniture, ceramics and silverwork. Decorative Arts are displayed throughout the galleries and put into exhibits. Unlike paintings, the decorative arts have other uses than for display so will help highlight the context the item was used for.

=== Donald J. Hall Sculpture Park ===
Outside on the museum&#x27;s immense lawn, the Donald J. Hall Sculpture Park, designed by Dan Kiley, contains the largest collection of monumental bronzes by Henry Moore in the United States. The park also includes works by Alexander Calder, Auguste Rodin, George Segal and Mark di Suvero, among others. Beyond these, the park (and the museum itself) is well known for &quot;Shuttlecocks&quot;, a four-part outdoor sculpture of oversized badminton shuttlecocks, standing 18 feet tall, by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen.

== Provenance research ==
The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art conducts provenance research to document the ownership histories of objects in its collection. This research aims to clarify the origins of artworks and address questions about past acquisitions.

One initiative in this area was the exhibition &quot;Origins: Collecting to Create the Nelson-Atkins&quot;, which examined how the museum built its collection. The exhibition highlighted key dealers and collectors, including C. T. Loo, who played a role in shaping the museum’s holdings.

<text>Wicked Lester was a rock band based in New York City. Two notable members were bassist Chaim Witz (as &quot;Gene Klein&quot;) and rhythm guitarist Stanley Eisen. Originally formed in 1970 as Rainbow, the band changed its name to Wicked Lester in 1971 to avoid confusion with another local band named &quot;Rainbow&quot;. Although it secured a record deal with Epic Records and recorded an album, the deal fell through and the band fell apart during 1972. Witz and Eisen, feeling that the band&#x27;s failure was a result of its lack of vision and direction, decided to found a new band from its remnants. They changed their stage names to Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley, respectively, auditioned a new drummer and lead guitarist, and formed the band Kiss by the end of January 1973.

Although Kiss achieved massive success, Wicked Lester&#x27;s album recorded for Epic has never been officially released in its entirety. The sessions have been released in bootleg form as &quot;The Original Wicked Lester Sessions&quot;. Kiss officially released three tracks from these sessions on their 2001 &quot;Box Set&quot; release. Wicked Lester&#x27;s music featured elements of rock and roll, folk rock and pop.

== History ==
=== Rainbow ===
The origins of the band trace to 1969, when keyboardist Brooke Ostrander joined bassist Klein and lead guitarist Stephen Coronel who had played together since 1964 in bands like The Long Island Sounds, Bullfrog Bheer and The Love Bag in the trio Coffee. In August 1970, Coronel recommended rhythm guitarist Stanley Eisen from his 1970 band The Tree, who had actually been rejected by the group after a previous audition. Shortly after Eisen joined, the band started using the name Rainbow and when Ostrander recruited drummer Joe Davidson, the first Rainbow lineup was completed. Davidson&#x27;s stay did not last long and he was replaced by drummer Tony Zarrella, another friend of Ostrander&#x27;s.

In early 1971, Rainbow played its first show, which consisted of two sets performed at Richmond Community College in Staten Island(which Klein had attended and graduated with a BA in Education degree in 1970). After the show, the group discovered that there was already another band called Rainbow. They decided to drop the name, and came up with the name Wicked Lester, which Klein liked because it was unusual. While the decision to change the group&#x27;s name came partly out of a desire to avoid any potential legal issues, it also reflected Klein and Eisen&#x27;s desire to start playing more original compositions.

=== Crossroads ===
During their brief existence, Wicked Lester performed in public twice. The first show took place at the Rivoli Theatre in South Fallsburg, New York on April 23, 1971. The second, in late summer 1971, was at an Atlantic City, New Jersey hotel hosting a B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Youth Organization event. Not long after that show, the band suffered a major setback when they had all of their musical gear stolen. On August 7, 1971 Wicked Lester recorded an acoustic demo tape of 20 songs with the line-up of Klein, Eisen and Coronel. The tape included songs going back to earlier bands Bullfrog Bheer and Rainbow, many that would end up on Wicked Lester&#x27;s unreleased album in full band versions, and a few that with some re-working made it to future Kiss albums.

After a chance meeting with Electric Lady Studios engineer Ron Johnsen who was introduced to the band via Eisen&#x27;s friend and former bandmate Neal Teeman who worked at the same studio, Wicked Lester was given the opportunity to record some demos in November 1971. Johnsen, who produced the demo tape, shopped it to a few labels, with no success. Eventually the tape was screened by Epic Records, who purchased the masters and agreed to fund the recording of a full album. One of the conditions, however, was that Stephen Coronel be fired and replaced with a better guitarist.

Coronel was replaced by session musician Ron Leejack (Ronald Jackowski, ex-Cactus) on December 15th, 1971, and the group continued their efforts to finish the album. Some songs were completely re-recorded to accommodate Leejack&#x27;s different playing style. The entire recording process, which followed a haphazard schedule, took nearly a year to complete. When the completed album was presented to Don Ellis, Epic&#x27;s A&amp;R director, in August 1972, he stated that he hated the album and was not going to release it. The next day, Wicked Lester manager Lew Linet requested and received the group&#x27;s release from Epic Records.

=== Kiss ===
At this time, Witz and Eisen, now using the stage names Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley as evidenced by the line-up on a studio tape from October 5th, 1972, decided that one of the reasons for Wicked Lester&#x27;s lack of success was their lack of a singular image and musical vision. They made the decision to move forward and start a new band and according to Leejack asked him to fire Zarrella and Ostrander. After completion, Brooke Ostrander, feeling that the band was going nowhere, quit the band in November 1972. He went on to teach music at Missisquoi Valley Union High School in Swanton, Vermont. Ostrander died on September 3, 2011, from cancer. Tony Zarrella claims he stayed with the band until &quot;Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley left the band&quot; &amp; afterwards recorded &amp; toured with NYC based groups &quot;Dreams In Color&quot; &amp; &quot;MYTH&quot;. 

For a short time, Ron Leejack continued on with the new version of Wicked Lester, which began auditioning for a drummer. Leejack officially resigned on January 15th 1973, only 2 weeks before the first Kiss show with Criss and Frehley but he may not have been active in the band since late 1972 as he also claims to have toured as the last guitarist of The Rascals that same year. 

Whereas Wicked Lester&#x27;s original sound was rooted in varied musical styles, including folk and pop, when Simmons and Stanley decided to recruit new members, they made the decision to focus on a more aggressive and simple style of rock and roll. The first new member they added was drummer Peter Criss, who had placed an ad in &quot;Rolling Stone,&quot; in late August or early September 1972. The ad stated, &quot;EXPD. ROCK &amp; roll drummer looking for orig. grp. doing soft &amp; hard music. Peter, Brooklyn.&quot; The new Wicked Lester, without a recording contract, began a strict and regular regimen of rehearsals.

In November 1972, the reimagined group (now a trio featuring Simmons, Stanley and Criss) arranged a showcase with Don Ellis, the Epic Records executive who earlier had rejected Wicked Lester&#x27;s album. While one Epic executive, Tom Werman, was impressed by the power and theatrics of this new incarnation of Wicked Lester, Ellis once again turned them down. As Ellis was leaving, Peter Criss&#x27;s brother, who was drunk, vomited on his foot. 

In early December, Paul Stanley placed an ad in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; stating, &quot;LEAD GUITARIST WANTED with Flash and Ability. Album Out Shortly. No time wasters please.&quot; The ad ran for two issues, December 7 and 14, 1972, leading to several audition sessions including one John Segall who later found fame as Jay Jay French in Twisted Sister. One audition was by Paul &quot;Ace&quot; Frehley who showed up wearing different-colored shoes, walked into the room without saying a word, hooked up his guitar and started playing. Frehley was asked back for a second audition and was a member of the band by Christmas 1972 or according to other sources on January 3, 1973. Within a few weeks, the group changed its name to Kiss and played their first concert on January 30, 1973.

== Unreleased album ==
The recording of Wicked Lester&#x27;s album, which began in November 1971 at Electric Lady Studios in Greenwich Village, took place over multiple sessions and was finished in July 1972. The album was a mixture of original material and covers, showcasing the group&#x27;s eclectic style. Three of the songs recorded for the Wicked Lester album would later resurface as Kiss songs, with varying degrees of similarity. Various versions and mixes have made it to bootleg circles, some with Coronel not credited which indicates that Leejack eventually replaced all his guitar parts.

The chorus of their cover version of The Hollies&#x27; &quot;I Wanna Shout&quot; would serve as the inspiration for &quot;Shout It Out Loud&quot; from 1976&#x27;s &quot;Destroyer&quot;, although the two songs otherwise bear little similarity. Two of the tracks, &quot;Love Her All I Can&quot;, written by Paul Stanley, and &quot;She&quot;, written by Simmons and Steve Coronel would resurface on 1975&#x27;s &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot;. &quot;Love Her All I Can&quot; featured similar arrangements in both versions while the Kiss version of &quot;She&quot; lacked the congas and flute of the original.

The only part of Wicked Lester&#x27;s album to initially be released was the cover art, which was used for The Laughing Dogs&#x27; self-titled debut album in 1979. CBS Records, which owned the rights to the album, remixed it and planned to release it in late 1976 to capitalize on Kiss&#x27;s popularity at the time. Kiss and Neil Bogart, the president of their label, Casablanca Records, purchased the master tapes from CBS for $137,500 and never released it. The label and band feared that if CBS released the tracks it would diminish their commercial appeal. The band worried that their hard rock image would be damaged by these more eclectic recordings. It was also feared that the release would be accompanied by pictures of Simmons and Stanley without their trademark makeup; Kiss had yet to officially unmask themselves at the time. In later years the album surfaced as a bootleg titled &quot;The Original Wicked Lester Sessions&quot;. The band bought Bogart&#x27;s share and eventually released three of the tracks, &quot;Keep Me Waiting,&quot; &quot;She,&quot; and &quot;Love Her All I Can&quot;, in 2001 as part of a five-disc box set.

<text>Dance Mania is a Chicago independent record label originally founded by Jesse Saunders for a one-off release of &quot;What&#x27;s That&quot; by The Browns in 1985. The label name was picked by Ray Barney one year later, with permission from Duane Buford who wrote the record.

The label released almost three hundred records until it closed in 1999. The label relaunched in 2013, following a recent DJ demand for their 90s records.

The label is regarded as hugely influential in the history of Chicago house music, and has been described as &quot;ghetto house&#x27;s Motown&quot;.

<text>Sir Douglas Frank Hewson Packer (3 December 19061 May 1974), was an Australian media proprietor who controlled Australian Consolidated Press and the Nine Network. He was a patriarch of the Packer family.

==Early life==
Frank Packer was born in Kings Cross, in the eastern suburbs of Sydney, New South Wales. His parents were Ethel Maude Packer (née Hewson; 1878–1947) and Robert Clyde Packer (1879–1934), who started the family&#x27;s association with the media as a journalist in New South Wales. His father, R. C. Packer, became editor of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; and was a founder of &quot;Smith&#x27;s Weekly&quot; and the &quot;Daily Guardian&quot;, which was published by Smith&#x27;s Newspapers Ltd.

&quot;A mischievous youngster and a poor student&quot;, Packer frequently switched schools, attending Turramurra College, Abbotsholme College, Wahroonga Grammar School, and Sydney Church of England Grammar School at various times. He did not sit for the Intermediate Certificate.

==Career==
In 1923, Packer became a cadet journalist on his father&#x27;s paper, the &quot;Daily Guardian&quot;. Four years later, he was a director of the company. In 1933, Packer started &quot;The Australian Women&#x27;s Weekly&quot; and then transformed &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; into one of Australia&#x27;s leading newspapers.

Packer inherited his media interests on his father&#x27;s death in 1934. In 1936, he joined with Ted Theodore&#x27;s Sydney Newspapers and Associated Newspapers to form Australian Consolidated Press. He was chairman of ACP from 1936 until 1974.

When television was introduced to Australia in 1956, Packer, along with the other major newspaper publishers (Fairfax, HWT and David Syme), became a significant television network shareholder under the federal government&#x27;s &quot;dual formula&quot;, which allowed each capital city to have two commercial networks and one ABC. He launched the first Australian station to broadcast a regular schedule, TCN in Sydney, which became the nucleus of the Nine Network.

The Packer media empire was known for its conservative leanings, and was a strong backer of long-serving Prime Minister Robert Menzies.

Packer was a keen yachtsman, boxer, golfer and polo player. He was on the Australian Jockey Club&#x27;s committee for 12 years and won the Caulfield Cup with his horse Columnist. He was also chairman of a syndicate that built the yachts &quot;Gretel&quot; and &quot;Gretel II&quot; to challenge for the America&#x27;s Cup in 1962 and 1970.

In 1972, Sir Frank Packer sold his newspaper flagship, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, to Rupert Murdoch.

In 1992, journalist Max Walsh told the House of Representatives Select Committee on the Print Media that Frank Packer had exerted undue newsroom influence. &quot;Sir Frank was knee-deep in [the] editorial policy of the &quot;Telegraph&quot;&quot;, Walsh said.

==Family life==
Frank Packer was married to Gretel Joyce Bullmore (1907–1960) on 24 July 1934 at All Saints Anglican Church, Woollahra. He had two sons, Clyde and Kerry, with his first wife, Gretel. Gretel Packer died in 1960.

Packer married for the second time in June 1964 to Florence Adeline Vincent (née Porges) in London. She died in 2012.
==Death==
On 1 May 1974, Packer died of heart failure at The Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown of &quot;Pneumonia and reticulum cell sarcoma&quot;. He was cremated at Northern Suburbs Crematorium and his ashes were interred within the Packer family mausoleum at South Head Cemetery.

His estate was valued for probate in 1975 at $2,393,703.11 which, adjusted for inflation, would account to $23,232,745.54 in 2023. Notable items declared in his estate, were paintings and sketches from some of Australia&#x27;s most renowned artists, located at the family home, &#x27;Cairnton&#x27; at Bellevue Hill was:

<text>Battleship Row was the grouping of seven U.S. battleships in port at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, when the Japanese attacked on 7 December 1941. These ships bore the brunt of the Japanese assault. They were moored next to Ford Island when the attack commenced. The ships were , , , , , , and . A repair ship (former coal ship), , was also present, moored next to &quot;Arizona&quot;.

== Creation ==
When the United States Navy decided in 1919 to establish a major naval base in Pearl Harbor, the southeastern side of Ford Island was ceded from control of the Army Air Service at the behest of Secretary of War Newton D. Baker. Due to its location in the center of the harbor, where the water was deepest and the potential for maneuvering greater than along the shores, this coast of Ford Island became the de facto mooring location for the Pacific Fleet&#x27;s battleships and took on the nickname &quot;Battleship Row&quot;.

== Attack and aftermath==

&quot;Arizona&quot;, &quot;California&quot;, &quot;Oklahoma&quot;, and &quot;West Virginia&quot; were sunk during the attack (albeit, &quot;California&quot; and &quot;West Virginia&quot; were refloated and rejoined the fleet in 1944). &quot;Arizona&quot; suffered the most serious damage and loss of life, an explosion in a forward magazine breaking the hull in two. Of the other four battleships, &quot;Nevada&quot; suffered damage sufficient to keep her non-operational until late 1942; &quot;Tennessee&quot; and &quot;Maryland&quot;, although damaged, returned to service in early 1942. &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; was in dry dock, making attack difficult, and, as a result, was relatively undamaged. &quot;Vestal&quot; was also damaged. Battleship Row was not visible from Hickam Field because of the thick black smoke. Following the attack, operations immediately commenced to refloat and repair the damaged ships. The first to be completed was &quot;Nevada&quot; on 19 April 1942. By the end of the war, all except &quot;Arizona&quot; and &quot;Oklahoma&quot; had returned to service. Each of the six surviving battleships saw service in the Pacific island hopping campaign. &quot;Nevada&quot; also served in the Atlantic and supported the invasion of Normandy. All six were decommissioned soon after the war was over. &quot;Nevada&quot; and &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; were expended in atomic bomb tests in the Pacific. The rest were scrapped in the late 1950s. &quot;Oklahoma&quot; was eventually refloated but not repaired, and capsized and sank while being towed back to the mainland for scrapping. &quot;Arizona&quot;″s hull remains a memorial, one of the most popular tourist attractions on the island.

 was in port at Pearl Harbor, but was not moored with the rest of the battleships, as she had since been converted to a target ship. However, she was still sunk within a few minutes of the battle.

== Ships that were attacked==
* : (flagship of Battleship Division One) hit by two armor-piercing bombs, exploded; total loss. 1,177 dead.
* : hit by nine torpedoes, capsized; total loss. 429 dead. Refloated November 1943; capsized and lost while under tow to the mainland May 1947.
* : hit by two bombs, nine torpedoes, sunk; returned to service July 1944. 106 dead.
* : hit by two bombs, two torpedoes, sunk; returned to service January 1944. 100 dead.
* : hit by six bombs, one torpedo, beached at Hospital Point; after attack, moved across channel and later sunk at Waipio Peninusula; returned to service October 1942. 60 dead.
* : hit by two bombs; returned to service February 1942. 5 dead.
* : hit by two bombs; returned to service February 1942. 4 dead (including floatplane pilot shot down).
* (flagship of the U.S. Pacific Fleet): in drydock with &quot;Cassin&quot; and &quot;Downes&quot;, hit by one bomb, debris from USS &quot;Cassin&quot;; remained in service. 9 dead.
* : hit by two torpedoes, capsized; total loss. 64 dead. Was commissioned as a target ship at the time of the attack and was docked on the west side of Ford Island, opposite Battleship Row.

<doc id="676484" wikidata="Q3543698" url="?curid=676484" title="Monitor (Mar Novu)">
<text>The Monitor or Over-Monitor, also known as Mar Novu, is a fictional character created by writer Marv Wolfman and artist George Pérez as one of the main characters of DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; limited series.

The character began appearing, along with his assistant Lyla Michaels, in numerous DC Comics titles beginning in 1982, three years before the Crisis began in July 1985; these appearances made it seem that he was some sort of weapons dealer for supervillains. This was all part of the setup Wolfman and the staff of DC Comics planned for the Crisis, showing the Monitor currying favor with villains such as Maxie Zeus, prior to calling on the heroes. The Monitor was depicted in the shadows for all of his appearances in DC&#x27;s mainstream superhero titles, and his face was first revealed in one of their few remaining non-superhero titles, the war comic &quot;G.I. Combat&quot; issue #274.

LaMonica Garrett portrayed the character on The CW&#x27;s Arrowverse, debuting during the 2018 crossover &quot;Elseworlds&quot;. This marked the first live-action adaptation of the character. The character has made subsequent appearances on several shows set in the Arrowverse. The character also appeared in the 2019 crossover &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;.

==Origin of the concept==
Wolfman conceived the concept of the character long before plans for &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. He explained it in a 1983 interview in the &quot;Comics Journal&quot;:

&quot;I had the character about 18 years ago. I called him the Librarian then because I didn’t have a good sense about names and thought that it would be a neat idea to do that. You know, one villain that the whole company could use. I didn’t have to sell it to Marvel, because they already had one universe, but when I came back to DC I indicated that I wanted to do it here. Everyone liked it but forgot to hand out the sheets I gave for their writers. So I have to redo it indicating how far you can take the character from month A to month B. Like for three months you can only show this much and after six months you can show that much, and at the end of a year we can reveal who that character is and start getting into interesting stories that all the writers can pick up on.&quot;

==Fictional character biography==
===Origins===
Thirteen billion years ago, the Multiverse was born due to tampering with the creation of the universe by Krona, a scientist from the planet Maltus who was attempting to view the beginning of the universe. As a result of his actions, an infinite number of parallel universes were brought into existence side by side, separated by minuscule vibrational differences, none of them as strong as the single universe that existed earlier would have been.

The Monitor and Anti-Monitor are born on the moons of Oa and Qward, respectively embodying the positive and negative universes.

====The Long War====
As the evil Anti-Monitor conquered his universe, the Monitor watched him, and, when the Anti-Monitor sensed his presence, they began battling across the dimensional barrier in a war that lasted one million years.

A simultaneous attack rendered them both unconscious, and they lay unmoving for more than nine billion years until the Monitor felt his evil counterpart awaken, as a result of another experiment on the creation of the universe by another scientist, which resulted in the destruction of that scientist&#x27;s universe. He found this scientist, a man who would become known as Pariah, and used him to follow the Anti-Monitor&#x27;s path of destruction in his newly created spaceship.

As the Anti-Monitor consumed worlds with his destructive antimatter, thus increasing his power as his antimatter universe expanded to fill the &#x27;gap&#x27; that had been left by the loss of the universe, the Monitor grew weaker. He studied every universe for the means to fight the Anti-Monitor, but, even though countless universes were threatened, he took the time to save an orphaned girl, the only survivor of a shipwreck, and raised her on his ship.

That girl, Lyla Michaels, grew up to become Harbinger, having been granted great powers by the Monitor. The Monitor went so far as to provide supervillains with technology, supposedly for money but in reality as a way to test the heroes and villains of Earth and find out which ones might help his cause.

===Crisis===

When the Anti-Monitor&#x27;s antimatter wave began approaching the main Earths of the Multiverse, the Monitor directed Harbinger to track down an initial force of fifteen specific heroes and villains the Monitor needed to fight his foe (this initial group featured Superman, Doctor Polaris, Dawnstar, Firebrand, Geo-Force, Obsidian, Cyborg, Killer Frost, Firestorm, Psycho-Pirate, Solovar, Blue Beetle, Psimon, Green Lantern, and Arion). He explained to them what was going on and sent them to protect giant tower-like devices that he had created on several places across space and time; his plan was to merge the surviving Earths into a single one that could resist the Anti-Monitor&#x27;s attack. He also sent Harbinger to recover the infant Alexander Luthor, Jr., the sole survivor of Earth-Three, who he believed would be of invaluable assistance.

When Harbinger returned, one of her incarnations had been attacked by one of the Anti-Monitor&#x27;s shadow demons, and that corruption caused her combined self to attack and kill the Monitor. However, he had foreseen the attack and used his death to power the machines that would pull Earth-One and Earth-Two into a netherverse created from the energies liberated by his own death, saving them from the Anti-Monitor&#x27;s unstoppable antimatter wall. He left Lyla a recorded message explaining this, trusting that she and the Multiverse&#x27;s heroes would complete the job and preserve the worlds before their vibration slowed down to an extent where they would destroy each other as they existed in the same place simultaneously.

Harbinger followed the Monitor&#x27;s legacy, using up her powers to draw the last three Earths (Earth-Four, Earth-S, and Earth-X) into the Netherverse. With help from Pariah, Alexander, and all the surviving heroes and villains from the various Earths, she eventually defeated the Anti-Monitor at the dawn of time, and then in his own antimatter universe, saving the reborn universe from his predations. These actions resulted in a &quot;reboot&quot; of the multiverse as a single universe, creating an amalgam of the five surviving Earths which possessed the strength to resist the Anti-Monitor&#x27;s attack.

The existence of the scheming but benevolent Monitor has apparently been forgotten by everyone except his closest associates as a result of the change in history.

===The Monitors===

During the events of &quot;Infinite Crisis,&quot; Alexander Luthor Jr. revives the multiverse by splitting the merged Earths in an effort to find a &quot;perfect earth&quot;, because he believed the surviving Earth to be corrupted. His plan is thwarted by Conner Kent, who destroys the tower he created to splinter the Earth. The re-collapse of the Earths resulted in excess energy that created a new multiverse consisting of 52 identical Earths. Luthor&#x27;s use of the Anti-Monitor&#x27;s armor to recreate the Multiverse acted as a &quot;seed program&quot; to proliferate all cloned universes with their own Monitor. The histories of the 52 Earths were changed as a result of Mister Mind&#x27;s multi-dimensional rampage. As a result of there being worlds with different histories, the Monitors now work as a collective to prevent interaction between the universes that could lead to a new Crisis.

===Final Crisis===
A new metafictional origin for the Monitors, including the first one featured in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, is later given during the &quot;Final Crisis&quot;.

The Monitor was originally a probe sent by the &quot;Overmonitor&quot; to explore the multiverse. However, the probe is overwhelmed by knowledge and splits into the Monitor and Anti-Monitor.

===DC Rebirth===
In the &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; relaunch, the Monitor, the Anti-Monitor, and the World Forger were created by Perpetua to guard the positive and negative universes.

==Powers and abilities==
Monitor&#x27;s powers were never well defined, but he was able to sense his counterpart&#x27;s existence in the anti-matter universe and fight with him to a stalemate in Oa&#x27;s moon using energy powers (though the feedback of the attack placed him in suspended animation for eons).

He was able to save Pariah (and possibly empower him to never die and be always drawn to where the Anti-Monitor was about to strike next) and create an entire satellite headquarters out of nothingness.

As a Monitor, he can, as told by Metron, &quot;Create with a thought&quot;.

==Other versions==
* A Monitor appears in &quot;Tiny Titans&quot;.
* The Monitors play prominent roles in the comic book continuation of the television series &quot;Smallville.&quot; However, in the mini-series &quot;Smallville: Alien&quot; it is revealed that the Monitors are not benevolent, but are actively pursuing the destruction of the Multiverse with one named Ray-Lan having crash landed in Russia. While being held captive he is interrogated by Lex Luthor under orders of the President after his destruction of Earth-Two. Ray-Lan then escapes with a powered exoskeleton to combat the Rocket Reds to search for his ship which is located in Chernobyl escaping Superman. While Lex and Clark explore Monitor&#x27;s spacecraft, Ray-Lan attacks and in the chaos, Superman saves Lex and destroys his ship, causing shrapnel to kill Ray-Lan via impalement. The Monitor&#x27;s corpse is taken to the Department of Extranormal Operations for observation.

==In other media==
* Mar Novu / The Monitor, with elements of Krona, appears in the Arrowverse, portrayed by LaMonica Garrett.
* The Monitor appears in &quot;Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, voiced by Jonathan Adams.

<text>The Iroquoian languages are a language family of indigenous peoples of North America. They are known for their general lack of labial consonants. The Iroquoian languages are polysynthetic and head-marking.

As of 2020, almost all surviving Iroquoian languages are severely or critically endangered, with some languages having only a few elderly speakers remaining. The two languages with the most speakers, Mohawk (Kenien&#x27;kéha) in New York and Canada, and Cherokee in Oklahoma and North Carolina, are spoken by less than 10% of the populations of their nations.

 — language extinct/dormant

Evidence is emerging that what has been called the &quot;Laurentian&quot; language appears to be more than one dialect or language. Ethnographic and linguistic field work with the Wyandot tribal elders (Barbeau 1960) yielded enough documentation for scholars to characterize and classify the Huron and Petun languages.

The languages of the tribes that constituted the tiny Wenrohronon, the powerful Conestoga Confederacy and the confederations of the Neutral Nation and the Erie Nation are very poorly documented in print. The Huron (Wyandot people) referred to the Neutral people as &quot;Atiwandaronk,&quot; meaning &#x27;they who understand the language&#x27;. The Wenro and Neutral are historically grouped together, and geographically the Wenro&#x27;s range on the eastern end of Lake Erie placed them between the larger confederations. To the east of the Wenro, beyond the Genesee Gorge, were the lands of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. To the southeast, beyond the headwaters of the Allegheny River, lay the Conestoga (Susquehannock). The Conestoga Confederacy and Erie were militarily powerful and respected by neighboring tribes. By 1660 all of these peoples but the Conestoga Confederacy and the Haudenosaunee Confederacy were defeated and scattered, migrating to form new tribes or adopted into others. The Iroquoian peoples had a practice of adopting valiant enemies into the tribe; they also adopted captive women and children to replace members who had died.

The group known as the Meherrin were neighbors to the Tuscarora and the Nottoway (Binford 1967) in the American South. They are believed to have spoken an Iroquoian language but documentation is lacking.

==External relationships==
Attempts to link the Iroquoian, Siouan, and Caddoan languages in a Macro-Siouan family are suggestive but remain unproven (Mithun 1999:305).

== Linguistics and language revitalization ==
As of 2012, a program in Iroquois linguistics at Syracuse University, the &quot;Certificate in Iroquois Linguistics for Language Learners&quot;, is designed for students and language teachers working in language revitalization.

Six Nations Polytechnic in Ohsweken, Ontario offers Ogwehoweh language Diploma and Degree Programs in Mohawk or Cayuga.

Starting in September 2017, the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Ontario started offering a credit course in Mohawk; the classes are to be given at Renison University College in collaboration with the Waterloo Aboriginal Education Centre, St. Paul&#x27;s University College.

<doc id="676486" wikidata="Q14704420" url="?curid=676486" title="Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art">
<text>Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art opened in 1994 in Kansas City, Missouri. With a $5 million annual budget and approximately 75,000 visitors each year, it is Missouri&#x27;s first and largest contemporary museum.

==Founders==
The core of the museum&#x27;s permanent collection is the Bebe and R. Crosby Kemper Jr. Collection, a gift of the museum&#x27;s founders. In May 2013, both Kempers stepped down from museum board of trustees, with their daughter, Mary Kemper Wolf, becoming the chairman of the board. R. Crosby Kemper Jr. died in 2014.

==Collection==

The Kemper Museum permanent collection includes more than 1,400 works created after the 1913 Armory Show to works by present-day artists. Artists in the permanent collection include Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Robert Motherwell, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Jim Dine, Tom Otterness, Helen Frankenthaler, David Hockney, Bruce Nauman, William Wegman, Nancy Graves, Dale Chihuly, Arthur Dove, Louise Bourgeois, Andrew Wyeth, Fairfield Porter, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, Frank Stella, Lesley Dill, Romare Bearden, Christian Boltanski, Robert Mapplethorpe, Garry Winogrand, Barbara Grad, Kojo Griffin, Jim Hodges, Wayne Thiebaud, Peter Anton, Hung Liu, Marcus Jansen, and Stephen Scott Young. In 2000, the museum received 15 works by artists including the photographer Nan Goldin from the collection of Peter Norton. Along with the collection, the museum also maintains a schedule of self-organized and traveling exhibitions. Each year, the museum presents 10–12 special exhibitions in its galleries.

The museum opened in 1994 with an exhibition of rare early series of 28 watercolors by Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, known as the &quot;Canyon Suite&quot; (1916–1918), that had never been shown publicly as a group. In 1999, the paintings&#x27; authenticity was challenged because the paper used for some of them could not have been obtained in the United States from 1916 to 1918, when O&#x27;Keeffe taught art at West Texas State Normal College in Canyon. The National Gallery of Art subsequently excluded the &quot;Canyon Suite&quot; from O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s catalogue raisonne, and Gerald Peters Gallery refunded the $5 million that the Kemper Museum paid for them.

==Architecture==
Kemper Museum’s 23,200-square-foot concrete, steel, and glass building, constructed from 1992 to 1994 at a cost of $6.6 million, was designed by architect Gunnar Birkerts. The structure has a large central atrium under an articulated skylight. Two wings extend from either side of the atrium. The main gallery hosts three major exhibitions each year. Side galleries present works from the permanent collection in rotation. Works of art are always on view in the atrium and the corridors of each wing. &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; noted that Birkerts “used concrete, glass and steel in ways that seemed to flow, almost as if shaped by hand”.

===Cafe===
Café Sebastienne combines the worlds of contemporary art and contemporary cuisine in the heart of the museum. The dining area features 110 paintings collectively known as &quot;The History of Art&quot; by renowned African-American artist Frederick J. Brown. The restaurant was named after his daughter, Sebastienne Nicole Brown.

<text>The Terme River (; ; , rendered Thermodon) is a short river in Samsun Province, Turkey draining into the Black Sea. Its sources are in the Pontic Mountains. It runs through the fertile Çarşamba plain to Salıpazarı, where it splits into three tributaries. The city of Terme is on the river, about 5 km from its mouth.

The ancient name of the river is the Thermodon, and the surrounding region was the Pontus. In antiquity, its mouth was about &quot;three plethra&quot; wide (ca. 300 feet), and it was navigable. The river, said by Strabo to have &quot;its many sources near Phanaroea... [in] many streams&quot; (which is not true; perhaps he was thinking of the Iris), was &quot;very often noticed by ancient writers&quot;, and its mouth was near the town of Themiscyra. Starting with Dionysius Periegetes, in his &quot;Periegesis of the World&quot;, the Thermodon is often confused with the Iris River (modern Yeşilırmak), which is much larger, flows through Phanaroea, and carries much more sediment.

In Greek mythology, the Thermodon was the location of the plain and capital, Themiscyra, where the Amazons dwelt.

<text>O&#x27;Neil Ford (December 3, 1905 – July 20, 1982) was an American architect of the mid-20th century in Texas, and a leading architect of the American Southwest. He is considered one of the nation&#x27;s best unknown architects, and his designs merged the modernism of Europe with the indigenous qualities of early Texas architecture. In 1974 he was designated a National Historic Landmark by the National Council on the Arts, the only individual to ever be given that title.

==Biography==
O&#x27;Neil Ford was born in Pink Hill, in Grayson County, Texas, in 1905. His family moved to Denton, in 1917 after the death of his father. He enrolled in North Texas State Teachers College (University of North Texas) for two years, but financial burdens forced him to abandon his efforts of a formal education. Instead, he earned an architectural certificate by mail from the International Correspondence Schools of Scranton, Pennsylvania.

In 1926, he began a long partnership with regional architects and was first mentored by architect David R. Williams. Together, they produced a number of fine regional houses of native brick, wood, and stone in north-central Texas. He entered into private practice in 1934 and worked with a series of partners within Texas beginning in 1936. His first residence designed in the modern style was at Turtle Creek Park in that year.

Ford was influenced by the tradition of the English Arts and Crafts movement and its attempt to combine architecture and visual arts. A strong preservationist, he helped launch Texas architecture on a new path by showing that its roots were deep and often beautiful. His well-crafted structures were composed of brick, glass, and wood, and were intimately tied to their settings. He enlisted his brother Lynn, a master carver and sculptor, to create custom doors, screens, and louvered grates. Ford contracted with local artist Martha Mood to produced light fixtures, fountains and wall hangings.

Ford was elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 1960. He was appointed to the National Council on the Arts by President Lyndon B. Johnson, and in 1974, Ford himself was designated a National Historic Landmark by the council (the only individual to ever be given that title). In 1967, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate Academician.

O&#x27;Neil Ford resided in San Antonio until his death in 1982 at age 76. His funeral was held on the campus of Trinity University in Margarite B. Parker Chapel, which he designed. In 2001, his drawings were donated by his widow, Wanda Graham Ford, to the Alexander Architectural Archive at the University of Texas at Austin. The gift included 5,540 original architectural drawings, 5,484 prints, 40 presentation drawings, 39 presentation sketches, and 63 sheets of photographic materials.

==Significant work==
Ford designed several buildings in Denton, among them the Little Chapel in the Woods, renovations at the Emily Fowler Public Library, the Denton Civic Center, Denton&#x27;s City Hall, and several buildings at the Selwyn School. Because his designs form much of Denton&#x27;s identity, a Texas historical marker honoring Ford was dedicated at the Emily Fowler Library in 2009.
Other Dallas works by Ford include much of the University of Dallas campus in Irving, Texas. He designed the Braniff Memorial Tower, the Braniff Graduate Center, the Gorman Lecture Center, parts of the art village, the Haggar University Center, and the Haggerty Science Building. Ford was awarded an honorary doctorate by the university in 1976.

Many of Ford&#x27;s works are in San Antonio, where he lived for much of his life. They include the renovation of La Villita, the campus of Saint Mary&#x27;s Hall, the University of Texas at San Antonio main campus, and the Tower of the Americas. On the campus of Trinity University, also located in San Antonio, are 26 O&#x27;Neil Ford-designed buildings, whose distinctive &quot;Bridgeport pink&quot; bricks and innovative lift slab building process are representative of his iconic architectural style. In June 2018, the campus of Trinity University was added to the National Register of Historic Places to highlight the architectural legacy of O&#x27;Neil Ford.

While constructing the Saint Mary&#x27;s Hall campus, O&#x27;Neil Ford strove to create a learning environment that merged the outdoors with the classroom. It is impossible to walk to classes at Saint Mary&#x27;s Hall without being outdoors.

Other significant works include Hedrick House (a residence for the Hedrick family, a prominent family in Lewisville, Texas, now owned by the city), buildings at Skidmore College and several facilities around the world designed for Texas Instruments. Shortly before his death, he completed the design of the building of the Museum of Western Art in Kerrville in the Texas Hill Country.

The San Antonio architectural firm of Ford, Powell and Carson carries on his name.

<text>MVP Baseball is a baseball game series published by EA Sports, running from 2003 to 2007 with five games produced. In 2003, &quot;MVP&quot; became the official successor to EA&#x27;s long-running &quot;Triple Play Baseball&quot; series, and it simulated Major League Baseball from 2003 to 2005. However, an exclusive licensing deal between Major League Baseball and Take-Two Interactive in 2005 prohibited EA Sports from making another MLB game until 2012. In response, EA made NCAA college baseball games in 2006 and 2007, but discontinued the series in 2008 because of poor sales.

The series is well-regarded, and MVP Baseball 2005 in particular is widely considered the best baseball video game of all time and possibly the best sports video game of all time.

==History==

===&quot;MVP Baseball 2003&quot;===

&quot;MVP Baseball 2003&quot; was released in 2003 as the successor to EA&#x27;s &quot;Triple Play&quot; games, though it bore little more than a graphical similarity to its predecessors, which had been heavily maligned by critics in the series&#x27; final years.

Introducing an innovative pitch meter and zone-based hitting system (see below), &quot;MVP 2003&quot; was well received by critics, most of whom considered the game&#x27;s overhaul to be a major improvement over &quot;Triple Play&quot;′s last entry. At the review-aggregation site Metacritic, &quot;MVP 2003&quot; was given a score of 81/100 for the PlayStation 2 and 82/100 for the Xbox.

Randy Johnson and Miguel Tejada were the cover players.

The 2003 game is the last game that uses a points system for player&#x27;s salary, starting with the 2004 game an actual dollar amount is used for salaries. The 2003 game does not penalize a user for releasing a player during the season in franchise mode, whereas the 2004 and 2005 games invoke a salary penalty for releasing a player under contract.

===&quot;MVP Baseball 2004&quot; &amp; &quot;2005&quot;===
Building on &quot;MVP 2003&quot;″s surprisingly successful rookie effort, the 2004 edition made major refinements to both the game&#x27;s control scheme and its dynasty mode. In a baseball gaming first, &quot;MVP 2004&quot; was licensed by both the MLB and Minor League Baseball, featuring real minor-league teams at the Class AA &amp; AAA levels. These improvements netted the PS2 and Xbox versions of &quot;MVP 2004&quot; twin scores of 90/100 at Metacritic, far outpacing the competing &quot;All-Star Baseball 2005&quot; and &quot;ESPN Major League Baseball&quot;.

Albert Pujols was the cover player for the 2004 installment of the series.

&quot;MVP Baseball 2005&quot; brought subtle changes to the &quot;MVP 2004&quot; formula, including a &quot;hitter&#x27;s eye&quot; system with color codes that helped players identify pitch types out of the pitcher&#x27;s hand, as well as an owner mode, the addition of Class A minor-league teams to dynasty mode, and spring training minigames. Reviewers continued to rate &quot;MVP&quot; highly, with Metacritic scores of 86 and 87 for the Xbox and PS2 versions, respectively, though &quot;MVP 2005&quot;′s marks were slightly lower than those of its predecessor. Even so, the game still edged out 2k Sports&#x27; &quot;Major League Baseball 2K5&quot; among critics.

Reigning World Series MVP Manny Ramirez was featured on the cover of the 2005 installment of the series.

In 2005, MVP Baseball released for PlayStation Portable.

===Exclusive licensing deal===
In 2005, in response to EA Sports&#x27; exclusive license with the National Football League and ESPN, Take-Two Interactive signed an exclusive third-party licensing contract with Major League Baseball (MLB), MLBPA and MLBAM to produce MLB games in its 2K Sports series, making MVP Baseball 2005 the last MLB game in the series. The agreement, which ran from Spring 2006 to 2012, allowed only Take-Two Interactive and the console manufacturers Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo to produce MLB titles for their respective platforms, but barred other third party developers such as EA Sports from continuing or developing their own MLB games.

&quot;MVP Baseball 2005&quot; was the last official MLB release from EA Sports, also official support for the game ended. Despite that, a very active modding community exists for the PC version of the game, who kept the game up-to-date the last decade. Modders have added much to the game, including roster updates, uniforms, players, and stadiums, as well as total conversions for foreign and classic teams.
===&quot;MVP: NCAA Baseball&quot;===

Barred from making MLB games, EA Sports made college baseball games for 2006 and 2007. Both editions of &quot;MVP: NCAA Baseball&quot; were officially licensed by the NCAA and released for the Xbox and PlayStation 2. The games featured actual NCAA teams and stadiums, though there were no real players.

A new &quot;load and fire&quot; batting system was integrated in 2006, to be followed by the addition of a &quot;rock and fire&quot; pitching system in 2007, both features that would later be emulated by &quot;MLB 11: The Show&quot; and &quot;Major League Baseball 2K11&quot; on seventh-generation consoles. The 2007 installment also featured online integration with ESPN, including commentary from Mike Patrick and former Stanford All-American Kyle Peterson. Former University of Texas star David Maroul was featured on the cover of &quot;MVP 06&quot;, while &quot;MVP 07&quot;′s cover athlete was former Long Beach State pitcher Jered Weaver.

===&quot;MVP Baseball Online&quot;===
In South Korea, EA has released 3 games called &quot;MVP Baseball Online 2012–2014&quot;.

===Possible revival===
In 2011, EA Sports released an MLB-licensed game for Facebook called &quot;World Series Superstars&quot;, which simulates team management, leading to speculation that MVP Baseball would return to consoles after the 2K Sports licensing deal expired in 2012.

In 2013, EA Sports executive vice president Andrew Wilson told video game blog Polygon that &quot;there is an inherent passion for baseball inside EA Sports&quot;, but that there were three barriers to EA&#x27;s willingness to develop a new MLB title: the need for a modern game engine to power the game; EA&#x27;s focus on other sports titles like &quot;NBA Live&quot;; and that the status of MLB&#x27;s licensing agreement with 2K Sports was unclear to them. In 2015, an EA Sports spokesman told Grantland that Wilson&#x27;s comments were &quot;still &#x27;the most accurate reflection&#x27; of the company’s position on getting back into baseball: Maybe later, but not now.&quot; In 2018, EA Sports executive vice president Cam Weber said, &quot;I would love to have a baseball game in our portfolio. ... It&#x27;s something that once again, every couple years, we take a look and we talk about and theorize about what it might look like to get back into something like baseball.&quot; In 2021, a website called Sports Gamers Online published an article stating EA&#x27;s Vancouver studio was working on a new baseball game but that it was years away from release.

In 2022, EA Sports published &quot;MLB Tap Sports Baseball 2022&quot; for smartphones. In 2023, EA Sports published &quot;Super Mega Baseball 4&quot;, its first console baseball video game since the &quot;MVP&quot; series. SMB 4 was developed by Metalhead Studios, which had been acquired by EA in 2021.

==Features==

===Players===
Until 2005, the game featured all players in the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA), as well as fictionalized counterparts for players who are not in the union. Barry Bonds, while an MLBPA member, did not sign the common MLBPA licensing agreement and was replaced by the fictional Jon Dowd. Some players who are not members of the MLBPA were omitted completely. For example, Kevin Millar, who is not a member of the MLBPA, was omitted completely from the 2004 edition, with David Ortiz leaving his real-life designated hitter spot and filling in at first base for the Boston Red Sox. In &quot;MVP Baseball 2005&quot;, he was replaced by the fictional Anthony Friese.

&quot;MVP Baseball 2004&quot; featured a unique addition to any baseball game, allowing users to play as the Minor League affiliations of Major League teams, a feature that was expanded in the following year. Various editions of the game have featured Randy Johnson, Miguel Tejada, Albert Pujols, and Manny Ramírez on its cover. Of those four, Tejada and Pujols have won Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards during their careers, and the other two have been named MVPs of the World series. Randy Johnson has also won the Cy Young Award five times.

===Innovations===
Upon its release in 2003, one of the game&#x27;s most inventive aspects was its pitch/throw meter. Until then, most baseball games&#x27; pitching schemes required players simply to press the button corresponding to the pitch they wanted to throw, and hold the button down for a certain length of time to determine how hard the pitch was thrown. In &quot;MVP Baseball&quot;, the player first holds down the pitch button (or throw button) to judge the power; once the desired power level is attained, the player must release the button and attempt to tap the same button within a target area. The closer the player gets to the target area, the more accurate the pitch or throw will be. While innovative within the field of baseball games, EA in fact adapted this feature from golf games, which often feature a moving meter to determine the power and accuracy of shots (golf games largely abandoned shot meters around the time that &quot;MVP Baseball&quot; introduced it).

The game also incorporated a strike zone divided into nine areas of the plate designed as &quot;hot and cold zones&quot;. The feature uses color-coding with the colors red, white, and blue to represent the player&#x27;s ability to hit pitches in the given area; red, white, and blue indicate whether the player hits well, neutrally, or poorly, respectively, in the given segment of the strike zone.

===Announcers===
Duane Kuiper and Mike Krukow, television and radio announcers for the San Francisco Giants, provided narration and commentary for the series. They had been approached in September 2002 and accepted EA&#x27;s offer. They recorded most of the lines for all three games during the 2002-2003 offseason, with additional lines for the 2004 and 2005 editions recorded as necessary. Some of the sessions were recorded during the MLB regular season, often leaving Krukow and Kuiper hoarse during actual Giants games. They pronounced hundreds of names with multiple inflections. Some calls were recorded while they watched real games on TV. In a 2025 interview about the 20th anniversary of the 2005 game&#x27;s release, Krukow said, &quot;In our wildest dreams, never did we feel that it was going to be remembered 20 years after with the way the world of video games changes. It’s unique in that it’s managed to still maintain its life with respect and affection.”

===Soundtracks===
Like all recent EA Sports games, the soundtrack to each &quot;MVP Baseball&quot; title contains licensed songs, called EA Trax. The &quot;MVP Baseball&quot; series typically featured alternative rock, ranging from mainstream artists like Sum 41 to indie acts like stellastarr*. The games featured several minor hits before they became popular such as &quot;C&#x27;mon C&#x27;mon&quot; by The Von Bondies which is also used as the theme song for the TV show &quot;Rescue Me&quot;.

<text>Rogue waves (also known as freak waves or killer waves) are large and unpredictable surface waves that can be extremely dangerous to ships and isolated structures such as lighthouses. They are distinct from tsunamis, which are long wavelength waves, often almost unnoticeable in deep waters and are caused by the displacement of water due to other phenomena (such as earthquakes). A rogue wave at the shore is sometimes called a &quot;sneaker wave&quot;.

In oceanography, rogue waves are more precisely defined as waves whose height is more than twice the significant wave height (&quot;H&quot; or SWH), which is itself defined as the mean of the largest third of waves in a wave record. Rogue waves do not appear to have a single distinct cause but occur where physical factors such as high winds and strong currents cause waves to merge to create a single large wave. Recent research suggests sea state crest-trough correlation leading to linear superposition may be a dominant factor in predicting the frequency of rogue waves.

Among other causes, studies of nonlinear waves such as the Peregrine soliton, and waves modeled by the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLS), suggest that modulational instability can create an unusual sea state where a &quot;normal&quot; wave begins to draw energy from other nearby waves, and briefly becomes very large. Such phenomena are not limited to water and are also studied in liquid helium, nonlinear optics, and microwave cavities. A 2012 study reported that in addition to the Peregrine soliton reaching up to about three times the height of the surrounding sea, a hierarchy of higher order wave solutions could also exist having progressively larger sizes and demonstrated the creation of a &quot;super rogue wave&quot; (a breather around five times higher than surrounding waves) in a water-wave tank.

A 2012 study supported the existence of oceanic rogue holes, the inverse of rogue waves, where the depth of the hole can reach more than twice the significant wave height. Although it is often claimed that rogue holes have never been observed in nature despite replication in wave tank experiments, there is a rogue hole recording from an oil platform in the North Sea, revealed in Kharif et al. The same source also reveals a recording of what is known as the &#x27;Three Sisters&#x27;.

== Background ==

Rogue waves are waves in open water that are much larger than surrounding waves. More precisely, rogue waves have a height which is more than twice the significant wave height (&quot;H&quot; or SWH). They can be caused when currents or winds cause waves to travel at different speeds, and the waves merge to create a single large wave; or when nonlinear effects cause energy to move between waves to create a single extremely large wave.

Once considered mythical and lacking hard evidence, rogue waves are now proven to exist and are known to be natural ocean phenomena. Eyewitness accounts from mariners and damage inflicted on ships have long suggested they occur. Still, the first scientific evidence of their existence came with the recording of a rogue wave by the Gorm platform in the central North Sea in 1984. A stand-out wave was detected with a wave height of in a relatively low sea state. However, what caught the attention of the scientific community was the digital measurement of a rogue wave at the Draupner platform in the North Sea on January 1, 1995; called the &quot;Draupner wave&quot;, it had a recorded maximum wave height of and peak elevation of . During that event, minor damage was inflicted on the platform far above sea level, confirming the accuracy of the wave-height reading made by a downwards pointing laser sensor.

The existence of rogue waves has since been confirmed by video and photographs, satellite imagery, radar of the ocean surface, stereo wave imaging systems, pressure transducers on the sea-floor, and oceanographic research vessels. In February 2000, a British oceanographic research vessel, the RRS &quot;Discovery&quot;, sailing in the Rockall Trough west of Scotland, encountered the largest waves ever recorded by any scientific instruments in the open ocean, with an SWH of and individual waves up to . In 2004, scientists using three weeks of radar images from European Space Agency satellites found ten rogue waves, each or higher.

A rogue wave is a natural ocean phenomenon that is not caused by land movement, only lasts briefly, occurs in a limited location, and most often happens far out at sea. Rogue waves are considered rare, but potentially very dangerous, since they can involve the spontaneous formation of massive waves far beyond the usual expectations of ship designers, and can overwhelm the usual capabilities of ocean-going vessels which are not designed for such encounters. Rogue waves are, therefore, distinct from tsunamis. Tsunamis are caused by a massive displacement of water, often resulting from sudden movements of the ocean floor, after which they propagate at high speed over a wide area. They are nearly unnoticeable in deep water and only become dangerous as they approach the shoreline and the ocean floor becomes shallower; therefore, tsunamis do not present a threat to shipping at sea (e.g., the only ships lost in the 2004 Asian tsunami were in port.). These are also different from the wave known as a &quot;hundred-year wave&quot;, which is a purely statistical description of a particularly high wave with a 1% chance to occur in any given year in a particular body of water.

Rogue waves have now been proven to cause the sudden loss of some ocean-going vessels. Well-documented instances include the freighter MS &quot;München&quot;, lost in 1978. Rogue waves have been implicated in the loss of other vessels, including the &quot;Ocean Ranger&quot;, a semisubmersible mobile offshore drilling unit that sank in Canadian waters on 15 February 1982. In 2007, the United States&#x27; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) compiled a catalogue of more than 50 historical incidents probably associated with rogue waves.

== History of rogue wave knowledge ==

=== Early reports ===

In 1826, French scientist and naval officer Jules Dumont d&#x27;Urville reported waves as high as in the Indian Ocean with three colleagues as witnesses, yet he was publicly ridiculed by fellow scientist François Arago. In that era, the thought was widely held that no wave could exceed . Author Susan Casey wrote that much of that disbelief came because there were very few people who had seen a rogue wave and survived; until the advent of steel double-hulled ships of the 20th century, &quot;people who encountered rogue waves generally weren&#x27;t coming back to tell people about it.&quot;

=== Pre-1995 research ===

Unusual waves have been studied scientifically for many years (for example, John Scott Russell&#x27;s wave of translation, an 1834 study of a soliton wave). Still, these were not linked conceptually to sailors&#x27; stories of encounters with giant rogue ocean waves, as the latter were believed to be scientifically implausible.

Since the 19th century, oceanographers, meteorologists, engineers, and ship designers have used a statistical model known as the Gaussian function (or Gaussian Sea or standard linear model) to predict wave height, on the assumption that wave heights in any given sea are tightly grouped around a central value equal to the average of the largest third, known as the significant wave height (SWH). In a storm sea with an SWH of , the model suggests hardly ever would a wave higher than occur. It suggests one of could indeed happen, but only once in 10,000 years. This basic assumption was well accepted, though acknowledged to be an approximation. Using a Gaussian form to model waves has been the sole basis of virtually every text on that topic for the past 100 years.

The first known scientific article on &quot;freak waves&quot; was written by Professor Laurence Draper in 1964. In that paper, he documented the efforts of the National Institute of Oceanography in the early 1960s to record wave height, and the highest wave recorded at that time, which was about . Draper also described &quot;freak wave holes&quot;.

=== Research on cross-swell waves and their contribution to rogue wave studies ===
Before the Draupner wave was recorded in 1995, early research had already made significant strides in understanding extreme wave interactions. In 1979, Dik Ludikhuize and Henk Jan Verhagen at TU Delft successfully generated cross-swell waves in a wave basin. Although only monochromatic waves could be produced at the time, their findings, reported in 1981, showed that individual wave heights could be added together even when exceeding breaker criteria. This phenomenon provided early evidence that waves could grow significantly larger than anticipated by conventional theories of wave breaking.

This work highlighted that in cases of crossing waves, wave steepness could increase beyond usual limits. Although the waves studied were not as extreme as rogue waves, the research provided an understanding of how multidirectional wave interactions could lead to extreme wave heights - a key concept in the formation of rogue waves. The crossing wave phenomenon studied in the Delft Laboratory therefore had direct relevance to the unpredictable rogue waves encountered at sea.

Research published in 2024 by TU Delft and other institutions has subsequently demonstrated that waves coming from multiple directions can grow up to four times steeper than previously imagined.

=== The 1995 Draupner wave ===
The Draupner wave was the first rogue wave to be detected by a measuring instrument. The wave was recorded in 1995 at Unit E of the Draupner platform, a gas pipeline support complex located in the North Sea about southwest from the southern tip of Norway. 

At 15:24 UTC on 1 January 1995, the device recorded a rogue wave with a maximum wave height of . Peak elevation above still water level was . The reading was confirmed by the other sensors. In the area, the SWH at the time was about , so the Draupner wave was more than twice as tall and steep as its neighbors, with characteristics that fell outside any known wave model. The wave caused enormous interest in the scientific community.

=== Subsequent research ===

Following the evidence of the Draupner wave, research in the area became widespread.

The first scientific study to comprehensively prove that freak waves exist, which are clearly outside the range of Gaussian waves, was published in 1997. Some research confirms that observed wave height distribution, in general, follows well the Rayleigh distribution. Still, in shallow waters during high energy events, extremely high waves are rarer than this particular model predicts. From about 1997, most leading authors acknowledged the existence of rogue waves with the caveat that wave models could not replicate rogue waves.

Statoil researchers presented a paper in 2000, collating evidence that freak waves were not the rare realizations of a typical or slightly non-gaussian sea surface population (&quot;classical&quot; extreme waves) but were the typical realizations of a rare and strongly non-gaussian sea surface population of waves (&quot;freak&quot; extreme waves). A workshop of leading researchers in the world attended the first Rogue Waves 2000 workshop held in Brest in November 2000.

In 2000, British oceanographic vessel RRS &quot;Discovery&quot; recorded a wave off the coast of Scotland near Rockall. This was a scientific research vessel fitted with high-quality instruments. Subsequent analysis determined that under severe gale-force conditions with wind speeds averaging , a ship-borne wave recorder measured individual waves up to from crest to trough, and a maximum SWH of . These were some of the largest waves recorded by scientific instruments up to that time. The authors noted that modern wave prediction models are known to significantly under-predict extreme sea states for waves with a &quot;significant&quot; height (Hs) above . The analysis of this event took a number of years and noted that &quot;none of the state-of-the-art weather forecasts and wave modelsthe information upon which all ships, oil rigs, fisheries, and passenger boats relyhad predicted these behemoths.&quot; In simple terms, a scientific model (and also ship design method) to describe the waves encountered did not exist. This finding was widely reported in the press, which reported that &quot;according to all of the theoretical models at the time under this particular set of weather conditions, waves of this size should not have existed&quot;.

In 2004, the ESA MaxWave project identified more than 10 individual giant waves above in height during a short survey period of three weeks in a limited area of the South Atlantic. By 2007, it was further proven via satellite radar studies that waves with crest-to-trough heights of occur far more frequently than previously thought. Rogue waves are now known to occur in all of the world&#x27;s oceans many times each day.

Rogue waves are now accepted as a common phenomenon. Professor Akhmediev of the Australian National University has stated that 10 rogue waves exist in the world&#x27;s oceans at any moment. Some researchers have speculated that roughly three of every 10,000 waves on the oceans achieve rogue status, yet in certain spotssuch as coastal inlets and river mouthsthese extreme waves can make up three of every 1,000 waves, because wave energy can be focused.

Rogue waves may also occur in lakes. A phenomenon known as the &quot;Three Sisters&quot; is said to occur in Lake Superior when a series of three large waves forms. The second wave hits the ship&#x27;s deck before the first wave clears. The third incoming wave adds to the two accumulated backwashes and suddenly overloads the ship deck with large amounts of water. The phenomenon is one of various theorized causes of the sinking of the on Lake Superior in November 1975.

A 2012 study reported that in addition to the Peregrine soliton reaching up to about 3 times the height of the surrounding sea, a hierarchy of higher order wave solutions could also exist having progressively larger sizes, and demonstrated the creation of a &quot;super rogue a breather around 5 times higher than surrounding wavesin a water tank. Also in 2012, researchers at the Australian National University proved the existence of &quot;rogue wave holes&quot;, an inverted profile of a rogue wave. Their research created rogue wave holes on the water surface in a water-wave tank. In maritime folklore, stories of rogue holes are as common as stories of rogue waves. They had followed from theoretical analysis but had never been proven experimentally.

&quot;Rogue wave&quot; has become a near-universal term used by scientists to describe isolated, large-amplitude waves that occur more frequently than expected for normal, Gaussian-distributed, statistical events. Rogue waves appear ubiquitous and are not limited to the oceans. They appear in other contexts and have recently been reported in liquid helium, nonlinear optics, and microwave cavities. Marine researchers universally now accept that these waves belong to a specific kind of sea wave, not considered by conventional models for sea wind waves. A 2015 paper studied the wave behavior around a rogue wave, including optical and the Draupner wave, and concluded, &quot;rogue events do not necessarily appear without warning but are often preceded by a short phase of relative order&quot;.

In 2019, researchers succeeded in producing a wave with similar characteristics to the Draupner wave (steepness and breaking), and proportionately greater height, using multiple wavetrains meeting at an angle of 120°. Previous research had strongly suggested that the wave resulted from an interaction between waves from different directions (&quot;crossing seas&quot;). Their research also highlighted that wave-breaking behavior was not necessarily as expected. If waves met at an angle less than about 60°, then the top of the wave &quot;broke&quot; sideways and downwards (a &quot;plunging breaker&quot;). Still, from about 60° and greater, the wave began to break vertically upwards, creating a peak that did not reduce the wave height as usual but instead increased it (a &quot;vertical jet&quot;). They also showed that the steepness of rogue waves could be reproduced in this manner. Lastly, they observed that optical instruments such as the laser used for the Draupner wave might be somewhat confused by the spray at the top of the wave if it broke, and this could lead to uncertainties of around in the wave height. They concluded, &quot;... the onset and type of wave breaking play a significant role and differ significantly for crossing and noncrossing waves. Crucially, breaking becomes less crest-amplitude limiting for sufficiently large crossing angles and involves the formation of near-vertical jets&quot;.

==Extreme rogue wave events==
On 17 November 2020, a buoy moored in of water on Amphitrite Bank in the Pacific Ocean off Ucluelet, Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, at recorded a lone tall wave among surrounding waves about in height. The wave exceeded the surrounding significant wave heights by a factor of 2.93. When the wave&#x27;s detection was revealed to the public in February 2022, one scientific paper and many news outlets christened the event as &quot;the most extreme rogue wave event ever recorded&quot; and a &quot;once-in-a-millennium&quot; event, claiming that at about three times the height of the waves around it, the Ucluelet wave set a record as the most extreme rogue wave ever recorded at the time in terms of its height in proportion to surrounding waves, and that a wave three times the height of those around it was estimated to occur on average only once every 1,300 years worldwide.

The Ucluelet event generated controversy. Analysis of scientific papers dealing with rogue wave events since 2005 revealed the claims for the record-setting nature and rarity of the wave to be incorrect. The paper &quot;Oceanic rogue waves&quot; by Dysthe, Krogstad and Muller reports on an event in the Black Sea in 2004 which was far more extreme than the Ucluelet wave, where the Datawell Waverider buoy reported a wave whose height was higher and 3.91 times the significant wave height, as detailed in the paper. Thorough inspection of the buoy after the recording revealed no malfunction. The authors of the paper that reported the Black Sea event assessed the wave as &quot;anomalous&quot; and suggested several theories on how such an extreme wave may have arisen. The Black Sea event differs in the fact that it, unlike the Ucluelet wave, was recorded with a high-precision instrument. The &quot;Oceanic rogue waves&quot; paper also reports even more extreme waves from a different source, but these were possibly overestimated, as assessed by the data&#x27;s own authors. The Black Sea wave occurred in relatively calm weather.

Furthermore, a paper by I. Nikolkina and I. Didenkulova also reveals waves more extreme than the Ucluelet wave. In the paper, they infer that in 2006 a wave appeared in the Pacific Ocean off the Port of Coos Bay, Oregon, with a significant wave height of . The ratio is 5.38, almost twice that of the Ucluelet wave. The paper also reveals the incident as marginally more extreme than the Ucluelet event. The paper also assesses a report of an wave in a significant wave height of , but the authors cast doubt on that claim. A paper written by Craig B. Smith in 2007 reported on an incident in the North Atlantic, in which the submarine &quot;Grouper&quot; was hit by a 30-meter wave in calm seas.

== Causes ==
Because the phenomenon of rogue waves is still a matter of active research, clearly stating what the most common causes are or whether they vary from place to place is premature. The areas of highest predictable risk appear to be where a strong current runs counter to the primary direction of travel of the waves; the area near Cape Agulhas off the southern tip of Africa is one such area. The warm Agulhas Current runs to the southwest, while the dominant winds are westerlies, but since this thesis does not explain the existence of all waves that have been detected, several different mechanisms are likely, with localized variation. Suggested mechanisms for freak waves include:
;Diffractive focusing: According to this hypothesis, coast shape or seabed shape directs several small waves to meet in phase. Their crest heights combine to create a freak wave.

;Focusing by currents: Waves from one current are driven into an opposing current. This results in shortening of wavelength, causing shoaling (i.e., increase in wave height), and oncoming wave trains to compress together into a rogue wave. This happens off the South African coast, where the Agulhas Current is countered by westerlies.

;Nonlinear effects (modulational instability):A rogue wave may occur by natural, nonlinear processes from a random background of smaller waves. In such a case, it is hypothesized, an unusual, unstable wave type may form, which &quot;sucks&quot; energy from other waves, growing to a near-vertical monster itself, before becoming too unstable and collapsing shortly thereafter. One simple model for this is a wave equation known as the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLS), in which a normal and perfectly accountable (by the standard linear model) wave begins to &quot;soak&quot; energy from the waves immediately fore and aft, reducing them to minor ripples compared to other waves. The NLS can be used in deep-water conditions. In shallow water, waves are described by the Korteweg–de Vries equation or the Boussinesq equation. These equations also have nonlinear contributions and show solitary-wave solutions. The terms soliton (a type of self-reinforcing wave) and breather (a wave where energy concentrates in a localized and oscillatory fashion) are used for some of these waves, including the well-studied Peregrine soliton. Studies show that nonlinear effects could arise in bodies of water. A small-scale rogue wave consistent with the NLS on (the Peregrine soliton) was produced in a laboratory water-wave tank in 2011.

;Normal part of the wave spectrum: Some studies argue that many waves classified as rogue waves (with the sole condition that they exceed twice the SWH) are not freaks but just rare, random samples of the wave height distribution, and are, as such, statistically expected to occur at a rate of about one rogue wave every 28 hours. This is commonly discussed as the question &quot;Freak Waves: Rare Realizations of a Typical Population Or Typical Realizations of a Rare Population?&quot; According to this hypothesis, most real-world encounters with huge waves can be explained by linear wave theory (or weakly nonlinear modifications thereof), without the need for special mechanisms like the modulational instability. Recent studies analyzing billions of wave measurements by wave buoys demonstrate that rogue wave occurrence rates in the ocean can be explained with linear theory when the finite spectral bandwidth of the wave spectrum is taken into account. However, whether weakly nonlinear dynamics can explain even the largest rogue waves (such as those exceeding three times the significant wave height, which would be exceedingly rare in linear theory) is not yet known. This has also led to criticism questioning whether defining rogue waves using only their relative height is meaningful in practice.:
;Constructive interference of elementary waves: Rogue waves can result from the constructive interference (dispersive and directional focusing) of elementary three-dimensional waves enhanced by nonlinear effects.:
;Wind wave interactions: While wind alone is unlikely to generate a rogue wave, its effect combined with other mechanisms may provide a fuller explanation of freak wave phenomena. As the wind blows over the ocean, energy is transferred to the sea surface. When strong winds from a storm blow in the ocean current&#x27;s opposing direction, the forces might be strong enough to generate rogue waves randomly. Theories of instability mechanisms for the generation and growth of wind waves – although not on the causes of rogue waves – are provided by Phillips and Miles.

The spatiotemporal focusing seen in the NLS equation can also occur when the non-linearity is removed. In this case, focusing is primarily due to different waves coming into phase rather than any energy-transfer processes. Further analysis of rogue waves using a fully nonlinear model by R. H. Gibbs (2005) brings this mode into question, as it is shown that a typical wave group focuses in such a way as to produce a significant wall of water at the cost of a reduced height.

A rogue wave, and the deep trough commonly seen before and after it, may last only for some minutes before either breaking or reducing in size again. Apart from a single one, the rogue wave may be part of a wave packet consisting of a few rogue waves. Such rogue wave groups have been observed in nature.

== Research efforts ==

A number of research programmes are currently underway or have concluded whose focus is/was on rogue waves, including:
* In the course of Project MaxWave, researchers from the GKSS Research Centre, using data collected by ESA satellites, identified a large number of radar signatures that have been portrayed as evidence for rogue waves. Further research is underway to develop better methods of translating the radar echoes into sea surface elevation, but at present this technique is not proven.
* The Australian National University, working in collaboration with Hamburg University of Technology and the University of Turin, have been conducting experiments in nonlinear dynamics to try to explain rogue or killer waves. The &quot;Lego Pirate&quot; video has been widely used and quoted to describe what they call &quot;super rogue waves&quot;, which their research suggests can be up to five times bigger than the other waves around them.
* The European Space Agency continues to do research into rogue waves by radar satellite.
* United States Naval Research Laboratory, the science arm of the Navy and Marine Corps published results of their modelling work in 2015.
* Massachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT)&#x27;s research in this field is ongoing. Two researchers there partially supported by the Naval Engineering Education Consortium (NEEC) considered the problem of short-term prediction of rare, extreme water waves and developed and published their research on a predictive tool of about 25 wave periods. This tool can give ships and their crews a two to three-minute warning of a potentially catastrophic impact allowing crew some time to shut down essential operations on a ship (or offshore platform). The authors cite landing on an aircraft carrier as a prime example.
* The University of Colorado and the University of Stellenbosch
* Kyoto University
* Swinburne University of Technology in Australia recently published work on the probabilities of rogue waves.
* The University of Oxford Department of Engineering Science published a comprehensive review of the science of rogue waves in 2014. In 2019, A team from the Universities of Oxford and Edinburgh recreated the Draupner wave in a lab.
* University of Western Australia
* Tallinn University of Technology in Estonia
* &quot;Extreme Seas Project&quot; funded by the EU.
* At Umeå University in Sweden, a research group in August 2006 showed that normal stochastic wind-driven waves can suddenly give rise to monster waves. The nonlinear evolution of the instabilities was investigated by means of direct simulations of the time-dependent system of nonlinear equations.
* The Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory did research in 2002, which dispelled the long-held contentions that rogue waves were of rare occurrence.
* The University of Oslo has conducted research into crossing sea state and rogue wave probability during the Prestige accident; nonlinear wind-waves, their modification by tidal currents, and application to Norwegian coastal waters; general analysis of realistic ocean waves; modelling of currents and waves for sea structures and extreme wave events; rapid computations of steep surface waves in three dimensions, and comparison with experiments; and very large internal waves in the ocean.

==Other media==

Researchers at UCLA observed rogue-wave phenomena in microstructured optical fibers near the threshold of soliton supercontinuum generation and characterized the initial conditions for generating rogue waves in any medium. Research in optics has pointed out the role played by a Peregrine soliton that may explain those waves that appear and disappear without leaving a trace.

Rogue waves in other media appear to be ubiquitous and have also been reported in liquid helium, in quantum mechanics, in nonlinear optics, in microwave cavities, in Bose–Einstein condensate, in heat and diffusion, and in finance.

== Reported encounters ==

Many of these encounters are reported only in the media, and are not examples of open-ocean rogue waves. Often, in popular culture, an endangering huge wave is loosely denoted as a &quot;rogue wave&quot;, while the case has not been established that the reported event is a rogue wave in the scientific sense – &quot;i.e.&quot; of a very different nature in characteristics as the surrounding waves in that sea state] and with a very low probability of occurrence.

This section lists a limited selection of notable incidents.

===19th century===
* Eagle Island lighthouse (1861) – Water broke the glass of the structure&#x27;s east tower and flooded it, implying a wave that surmounted the cliff and overwhelmed the tower.
* Flannan Isles Lighthouse (1900) – Three lighthouse keepers vanished after a storm that resulted in wave-damaged equipment being found above sea level.

===20th century===
* SS &quot;Kronprinz Wilhelm&quot;, September 18, 1901 – The most modern German ocean liner of its time (winner of the Blue Riband) was damaged on its maiden voyage from Cherbourg to New York by a huge wave. The wave struck the ship head-on.
* RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; (1910) – On the night of 10 January 1910, a wave struck the ship over the bow, damaging the forecastle deck and smashing the bridge windows.
* Voyage of the &quot;James Caird&quot; (1916) – Sir Ernest Shackleton encountered a wave he termed &quot;gigantic&quot; while piloting a lifeboat from Elephant Island to South Georgia.
* USS &quot;Memphis&quot;, August 29, 1916 – An armored cruiser, formerly known as the USS &quot;Tennessee&quot;, wrecked while stationed in the harbor of Santo Domingo, with 43 men killed or lost, by a succession of three waves, the largest estimated at 70 feet.
* RMS &quot;Homeric&quot; (1924) – Hit by a wave while sailing through a hurricane off the East Coast of the United States, injuring seven people, smashing numerous windows and portholes, carrying away one of the lifeboats, and snapping chairs and other fittings from their fastenings.
* USS &quot;Ramapo&quot; (1933) – Triangulated at .
* (1942) – by a wave and listed briefly about 52° before slowly righting.
* SS &quot;Michelangelo&quot; (1966) – Hole torn in superstructure, heavy glass was smashed by the wave above the waterline, and three deaths.
* (1975) – Lost on Lake Superior, a Coast Guard report blamed water entry to the hatches, which gradually filled the hold, or errors in navigation or charting causing damage from running onto shoals. However, another nearby ship, the , was hit at a similar time by two rogue waves and possibly a third, and this appeared to coincide with the sinking around 10 minutes later.
* (1978) – Lost at sea, leaving only scattered wreckage and signs of sudden damage including extreme forces above the water line. Although more than one wave was probably involved, this remains the most likely sinking due to a freak wave.
* Esso Languedoc (1980) – A wave washed across the deck from the stern of the French supertanker near Durban, South Africa.
* Fastnet Lighthouse – Struck by a wave in 1985
* Draupner wave (North Sea, 1995) – The first rogue wave confirmed with scientific evidence, it had a maximum height of .
* &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; (1995) – Encountered a wave in the North Atlantic, during Hurricane Luis. The master said it &quot;came out of the darkness&quot; and &quot;looked like the White Cliffs of Dover.&quot; Newspaper reports at the time described the cruise liner as attempting to &quot;surf&quot; the near-vertical wave in order not to be sunk.

===21st century===
* U.S. Naval Research Laboratory ocean-floor pressure sensors detected a freak wave caused by Hurricane Ivan in the Gulf of Mexico, 2004. The wave was around high from peak to trough, and around long. Their computer models also indicated that waves may have exceeded in the eyewall.
* &quot;Aleutian Ballad&quot;, (Bering Sea, 2005) footage of what is identified as an wave appears in an episode of &quot;Deadliest Catch&quot;. The wave strikes the ship at night and cripples the vessel, causing the boat to tip for a short period onto its side. This is one of the few video recordings of what might be a rogue wave.
* In 2006, researchers from U.S. Naval Institute theorized rogue waves may be responsible for the unexplained loss of low-flying aircraft, such as U.S. Coast Guard helicopters during search-and-rescue missions.
* MS &quot;Louis Majesty&quot; (Mediterranean Sea, March 2010) was struck by three successive waves while crossing the Gulf of Lion on a Mediterranean cruise between Cartagena and Marseille. Two passengers were killed by flying glass when the second and third waves shattered a lounge window. The waves, which struck without warning, were all abnormally high in respect to the sea swell at the time of the incident.
* In 2011, the Sea Shepherd vessel &quot;MV Brigitte Bardot&quot;was damaged by a rogue wave of 11 m (36.1 ft) while pursuing the Japanese whaling fleet off the western coast of Australia on 28 December 2011. The MV &quot;Brigitte Bardot&quot; was escorted back to Fremantle by the SSCS flagship, MV &quot;Steve Irwin&quot;. The main hull was cracked, and the port side pontoon was being held together by straps. The vessel arrived at Fremantle Harbor on 5 January 2012. Both ships were followed by the ICR security vessel MV &quot;Shōnan Maru 2&quot; at a distance of 5 nautical miles (9 km).
* In 2019, Hurricane Dorian&#x27;s extratropical remnant generated a rogue wave off the coast of Newfoundland.
* In 2022, the Viking cruise ship &quot;Viking Polaris&quot; was hit by a rogue wave on its way to Ushuaia, Argentina. One person died, four more were injured, and the ship&#x27;s scheduled route to Antarctica was canceled.

==Quantifying the impact of rogue waves on ships==

The loss of the in 1978 provided some of the first physical evidence of the existence of rogue waves. &quot;München&quot; was a state-of-the-art cargo ship with multiple water-tight compartments and an expert crew. She was lost with all crew, and the wreck has never been found. The only evidence found was the starboard lifeboat recovered from floating wreckage sometime later. The lifeboats hung from forward and aft blocks above the waterline. The pins had been bent back from forward to aft, indicating the lifeboat hanging below it had been struck by a wave that had run from fore to aft of the ship and had torn the lifeboat from the ship. To exert such force, the wave must have been considerably higher than . At the time of the inquiry, the existence of rogue waves was considered so statistically unlikely as to be near impossible. Consequently, the Maritime Court investigation concluded that the severe weather had somehow created an &quot;unusual event&quot; that had led to the sinking of the &quot;München&quot;.

In 1980, the MV &quot;Derbyshire&quot; was lost during Typhoon Orchid south of Japan, along with all of her crew. The &quot;Derbyshire&quot; was an ore-bulk oil combination carrier built in 1976. At 91,655 gross register tons, she remains the largest British ship ever lost at sea. The wreck was found in June 1994. The survey team deployed a remotely operated vehicle to photograph the wreck. A private report published in 1998 prompted the British government to reopen a formal investigation into the sinking. The investigation included a comprehensive survey by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, which took 135,774 pictures of the wreck during two surveys. The formal forensic investigation concluded that the ship sank because of structural failure and absolved the crew of any responsibility. Most notably, the report determined the detailed sequence of events that led to the structural failure of the vessel. A third comprehensive analysis was subsequently done by Douglas Faulkner, professor of marine architecture and ocean engineering at the University of Glasgow. His 2001 report linked the loss of the &quot;Derbyshire&quot; with the emerging science on freak waves, concluding that the &quot;Derbyshire&quot; was almost certainly destroyed by a rogue wave.

Work by sailor and author Craig B. Smith in 2007 confirmed prior forensic work by Faulkner in 1998 and determined that the &quot;Derbyshire&quot; was exposed to a hydrostatic pressure of a &quot;static head&quot; of water of about with a resultant static pressure of . This is in effect of seawater (possibly a super rogue wave) flowing over the vessel. The deck cargo hatches on the &quot;Derbyshire&quot; were determined to be the key point of failure when the rogue wave washed over the ship. The design of the hatches only allowed for a static pressure less than of water or , meaning that the typhoon load on the hatches was more than 10 times the design load. The forensic structural analysis of the wreck of the &quot;Derbyshire&quot; is now widely regarded as irrefutable.

In addition, fast-moving waves are now known to also exert extremely high dynamic pressure. Plunging or breaking waves are known to cause short-lived impulse pressure spikes called Gifle peaks. These can reach pressures of (or more) for milliseconds, which is sufficient pressure to lead to brittle fracture of mild steel. Evidence of failure by this mechanism was also found on the &quot;Derbyshire&quot;. Smith documented scenarios where hydrodynamic pressure up to or over 500 metric tonnes/m2 could occur.

In 2004, an extreme wave was recorded impacting the Alderney Breakwater, Alderney, in the Channel Islands. This breakwater is exposed to the Atlantic Ocean. The peak pressure recorded by a shore-mounted transducer was . This pressure far exceeds almost any design criteria for modern ships, and this wave would have destroyed almost any merchant vessel.

==Design standards==

In November 1997, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted new rules covering survivability and structural requirements for bulk carriers of and upwards. The bulkhead and double bottom must be strong enough to allow the ship to survive flooding in hold one unless loading is restricted.

Rogue waves present considerable danger for several reasons: they are rare, unpredictable, may appear suddenly or without warning, and can impact with tremendous force. A wave in the usual &quot;linear&quot; model would have a breaking force of . Although modern ships are typically designed to tolerate a breaking wave of 15 t/m2, a rogue wave can dwarf both of these figures with a breaking force far exceeding 100 t/m2. Smith presented calculations using the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) Common Structural Rules for a typical bulk carrier.

Peter Challenor, a scientist from the National Oceanography Centre in the United Kingdom, was quoted in Casey&#x27;s book in 2010 as saying: &quot;We don&#x27;t have that random messy theory for nonlinear waves. At all.&quot; He added, &quot;People have been working actively on this for the past 50 years at least. We don&#x27;t even have the start of a theory.&quot;

In 2006, Smith proposed that the IACS recommendation 34 pertaining to standard wave data be modified so that the minimum design wave height be increased to . He presented analysis that sufficient evidence exists to conclude that high waves can be experienced in the 25-year lifetime of oceangoing vessels, and that high waves are less likely, but not out of the question. Therefore, a design criterion based on high waves seems inadequate when the risk of losing crew and cargo is considered. Smith also proposed that the dynamic force of wave impacts should be included in the structural analysis.
The Norwegian offshore standards now consider extreme severe wave conditions and require that a 10,000-year wave does not endanger the ships&#x27; integrity. W. Rosenthal noted that as of 2005, rogue waves were not explicitly accounted for in Classification Society&#x27;s rules for ships&#x27; design. As an example, DNV GL, one of the world&#x27;s largest international certification bodies and classification society with main expertise in technical assessment, advisory, and risk management publishes their Structure Design Load Principles which remain largely based on the Significant Wave Height, and as of January 2016, still have not included any allowance for rogue waves.

The U.S. Navy historically took the design position that the largest wave likely to be encountered was . Smith observed in 2007 that the navy now believes that larger waves can occur and the possibility of extreme waves that are steeper (i.e. do not have longer wavelengths) is now recognized. The navy has not had to make any fundamental changes in ship design due to new knowledge of waves greater than 21.4 m because the ships are built to higher standards than required.

The more than 50 classification societies worldwide each has different rules. However, most new ships are built to the standards of the 12 members of the International Association of Classification Societies, which implemented two sets of common structural rules - one for oil tankers and one for bulk carriers, in 2006. These were later harmonised into a single set of rules.

<text>William Dickenson Hunter, (May 5, 1920 – December 16, 2002) was a Canadian sports promoter and ice hockey player, coach, manager, and investor. Also known as &quot;Wild Bill&quot;, Hunter co-founded the Western Hockey League (WHL), helped to launch the World Hockey Association (WHA), and worked to bring professional hockey to Edmonton and to his hometown of Saskatoon.

==Early life==
Born in Saskatoon, Hunter founded his first competitive sports team when he was 18, the Saskatoon Dukes Football Club. Hunter attended Notre Dame College in Wilcox, Saskatchewan, where he managed the college&#x27;s sports teams, including organizing a 78-game tour for the baseball team.

Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Hunter left school to join the Royal Air Force&#x27;s International Squadron and served as a pilot based in England. After his time in the war, Hunter returned to Saskatoon, where he worked briefly for CFQC Radio before opening Hunter&#x27;s Sporting Goods in North Battleford the following year.

==Career in hockey==
===Beginnings===
Between 1945 and 1949 Hunter coached and managed hockey teams in North Battleford, Regina, Moose Jaw, Yorkton, and Saskatoon. It was during these years that Hunter was nicknamed &quot;Wild Bill&quot; following a dispute with a referee. Hunter did not like the nickname at first, but he ultimately embraced it. In 1950, Hunter founded the first curling bonspiel to be held on artificial ice, the Quaker Car Curling Bonspiel. He also managed and coached the Saskatoon Quakers hockey club until 1952.

From 1953 to 1956, he was the owner, manager, and coach of the Medicine Hat Tigers. In September 1956, Hunter claimed that, as owner, he could rightfully sell players. Alberta Amateur Hockey Association president Art Potter disagreed that any junior team owned its players or had the right to sell them to another team, and compared the idea to slavery. He warned that proper transfers must be completed to change teams and that players could be suspended if an agreement was not honoured to play for a team.

===Founding the WHL===
Hunter was the owner, manager, and coach of the junior Edmonton Oil Kings in the mid-1960s. In seven years from 1960–1966, the Oil Kings played for the Memorial Cup every year, but won just twice, in 1963 and 1966—the latter with Hunter at the helm—and finishing as runner-up to five teams. Hunter felt that the competitive structure of the game in Western Canada was putting the region at a disadvantage to stronger leagues in Ontario and Quebec; each western province still had its own junior league while Hunter believed the West needed a single top tier junior league to compete effectively with the larger associations out east. He found three partners who felt the same way: Scotty Munro of the Estevan Bruins, Del Wilson of the Regina Pats, and Jim Piggott of the Saskatoon Blades. The four men co-founded the Canadian Major Junior Hockey League, to begin play in 1966, and recruited the Calgary Buffaloes, Moose Jaw Canucks, and Weyburn Red Wings to join their teams in the upstart league. By its second season, the league added four more teams, including three based in Manitoba, and by 1971 the league spanned all four western provinces, from Manitoba to British Columbia.

The league had a rocky early relationship with the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association, the national governing body for amateur hockey, which considered the fledgling group to be an &quot;outlaw league.&quot; The CMJHL, which was renamed the Western Canada Junior Hockey League in 1967 and the Western Canada Hockey League in 1968, was suspended from CAHA-sanctioned events, including, ironically, the Memorial Cup. However, the new league held together, and when CAHA reorganized Canadian junior hockey in 1971, it recognized the WCHL as one of the three top-tier junior leagues in the country. By 1972, the Memorial Cup&#x27;s modern round-robin format was established, featuring a playoff between each top-tier league&#x27;s champion. Since then, teams from the WHL have won the Memorial Cup 19 times, compared to 17 times for teams from the Ontario Hockey League and 14 times for teams from the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. In 1978 the WCHL shortened its name to the Western Hockey League with the admission of American-based teams.

===Founding the WHA and the Oilers===
Following the establishment of the Western Junior League, Hunter set his sights on professional hockey, desiring to bring a National Hockey League (NHL) team to Edmonton. The NHL was expanding rapidly in the late 1960s and early 1970s, but the league rebuffed Hunter&#x27;s proposal for an Edmonton team. Hunter offered to purchase and relocate the Pittsburgh Penguins, but this proposal was rejected. In 1971, Hunter was introduced to Gary Davidson and Dennis Murphy, two American investors who wanted to establish a professional league that could rival the NHL and provide smaller markets the opportunity to join the major leagues. Hunter became the key figure in securing further investment and franchise commitments—he later recalled that it quickly became apparent that Davidson and Murphy &quot;didn’t know a damn thing about hockey&quot;—and before the end of 1971, the World Hockey Association was taking shape, set to begin play in 1972. Hunter was the league&#x27;s founding president.

On November 1, 1971, the Alberta Oilers became one of the 12 charter WHA franchises, founded by Hunter and a partner, Edmonton surgeon and entrepreneur Chuck Allard. Hunter named the team after the junior Oil Kings. The team was to be based in Edmonton, fulfilling Hunter&#x27;s promise to bring the city a professional franchise, and they were joined in the WHA by another small market western Canadian team, the Winnipeg Jets.

Hunter knew that the WHA needed to make a splash to gain credibility, and he came up with a scheme to sign NHL superstar Bobby Hull, then in a contract dispute with the Chicago Black Hawks, to hockey&#x27;s first million-dollar contract. Ben Hatskin, who Hunter had recruited to help get the WHA off the ground and who founded the Jets, agreed to sign Hull to the contract; however, it took contributions from every team to meet the $1 million commitment, making Hull&#x27;s contract the first instance in professional sports where every member of a league pitched in to sign a player to one team. Another major scheme was the staging of a second Summit Series between Canada and the Soviet Union, but this time having the Canadian team made up of WHA players. This second Summit Series took place in 1974, further increasing the credibility of the new league, although Canada lost the series.

Hunter and Allard&#x27;s Oilers were assembled to prominently feature Albertan players, and its opening roster had eleven such players, including seven who had played for the junior Oil Kings. This included NHL recruit and leading scorer Jim Harrison, who on January 13, 1973, became the first major league player of the modern era to record 10 points in a match. The Alberta Oilers, who were renamed the Edmonton Oilers after their inaugural season, won the first game in WHA history, defeating the Ottawa Nationals 7–4. Hunter took over as the Oilers coach mid-season on three occasions, in 1973, 1975, and 1976. The team initially played in the dated, 4,500 seat Edmonton Gardens, but the team&#x27;s financial success enabled Hunter and Allard to secure a new arena, the 16,500 seat Northlands Coliseum, which was completed in 1974. That same year, Hunter and Allard sold the franchise to Nelson Skalbania and Peter Pocklington; Pocklington would become sole owner in 1977. Ironically, the success of the Oilers ultimately led to the demise of Hunter&#x27;s old junior team, as the Oil Kings relocated to Portland in 1976 and became the Winter Hawks.

The WHA struggled with financial stability, and franchises commonly relocated or folded altogether. By the 1978–79 season, the league was down to six teams. The league had long been in talks with the NHL about a merger, and in 1979 reached an agreement whereby the Oilers, Jets, Quebec Nordiques, and New England Whalers—thereafter renamed the Hartford Whalers—joined the NHL for the 1979–80 season. Although he was no longer the Oilers&#x27; owner, this fulfilled Hunter&#x27;s dream of bringing the NHL to Edmonton. Moreover, in 1980, Skalbania led a group of investors who purchased the struggling Atlanta Flames and re-located the team to Calgary, bringing a second NHL team to Alberta. The Oilers became a dynasty in the ensuing decade; coached by Glen Sather and led on the ice by Wayne Gretzky, the team won the Stanley Cup five times between 1984 and 1990.

Today, the Edmonton Oilers&#x27; mascot, Hunter, is named in Bill Hunter&#x27;s honour.

===The &quot;Saskatoon Blues&quot;===
After divesting the Oilers, Hunter continued to aim to bring NHL hockey to new markets, and his last major project was an attempt to secure a franchise for Saskatoon. In 1983, Hunter led a group that purchased the struggling St. Louis Blues, with plans to relocate the team to Saskatchewan. The Blues appeared to be an ideal fit for such a move. The team&#x27;s general manager, Emile Francis, was from Saskatchewan and had played for Hunter&#x27;s Regina Capitals in the 1940s; the team featured Saskatchewan native and former Saskatoon Blades star Bernie Federko; and Hunter&#x27;s son, Bart, even played goal for the Blues&#x27; minor-league affiliate, the Salt Lake Golden Eagles. Although Saskatoon&#x27;s population was 160,000 at the time, which would have made it by far the smallest market in the NHL, Hunter&#x27;s plan included securing financial backing from the province for a new 18,000-seat stadium to replace the aging Saskatoon Arena, along with thousands of season-ticket deposits. The team was prepared to play games in Regina until the new arena was ready. Moreover, Hunter negotiated a 20-year, $20 million sponsorship agreement with Molson&#x27;s, and also worked with Air Canada to ensure new flight schedules between Saskatoon and NHL markets. Finally, Hunter even offered the head coaching position for the hoped-for Saskatoon team to former Boston Bruins coach Don Cherry, who agreed and joined Hunter in promoting the scheme.

When Hunter announced his purchase of the Blues from Ralston Purina, he exclaimed that the Saskatoon Blues would be the &quot;finest franchise in the league&quot; and the new arena &quot;the most magnificent hockey building in North America,&quot; which the &quot;wonderful people of Saskatchewan&quot; deserved. However, most NHL owners opposed the move, with Toronto Maple Leafs owner Harold Ballard famously stating that visiting teams would have to travel by dog sled to Saskatoon. After the purchase agreement, Hunter still had to gain approval from the NHL&#x27;s board of governors; he traveled to New York to pitch his vision, but the board voted against it by an overwhelming 15–3 margin. Although the size of the Saskatoon market was one reason for the rejection, so too was Hunter&#x27;s tumultuous relationship with the NHL, stemming from his earlier days with the WHA. Hunter and his group were given the option of owning the team if they committed to keeping it in St. Louis, but Hunter was not interested. The league instead took over the Blues after Ralston Purina walked away, and eventually sold the team to Harry Ornest.

Although the Blues plan fell through, Saskatoon and the province followed through on building a new arena, dubbed Saskatchewan Place, which was completed in 1988. Although the arena was not built downtown, which Hunter had advocated for, the new arena helped to keep Hunter&#x27;s dream alive. He made one final effort to bring the NHL to Saskatoon by putting together a bid for an expansion franchise in the early 1990s when the league was undergoing another round of rapid expansion. A Hunter-led group reportedly raised $50 million towards such a formal bid, and needing an additional $20 million, requested support from the Saskatchewan government. However, unlike in 1983, the province turned down that support, and Hunter&#x27;s bid collapsed by 1992 when the NHL welcomed the Ottawa Senators and Tampa Bay Lightning as expansion teams.

==Later years and death==
Following his unsuccessful attempts to bring the NHL to Saskatoon, Hunter organized softball tournaments in his hometown and invested in the San Diego Gulls hockey club. He remained active in the 1990s, helping to organize the Flexi-Coil curling cashspiel in his hometown before his health began to fail. He also played an ambassadorial role for the Edmonton Oilers. Upon Hunter&#x27;s death in 2002, Oilers general manager Kevin Lowe noted that Hunter was important to keep the Oilers in Edmonton through the 1990s, a decade that saw two other former WHA franchises, the Winnipeg Jets and Quebec Nordiques, relocate to the United States, and which saw the Oilers undergo a tumultuous sale of its own that threatened relocation. Today, the Oilers are the only franchise that joined the NHL from the WHA that remains in its original location.

Hunter died of cancer in Edmonton on December 16, 2002. He is interred at Holy Cross Cemetery. Hunter was married four times, and had seven children.

===Honours===
Hunter was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2000. He was inducted into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame in 2001, and the Saskatchewan Sports Hall of Fame in 2002. After his death, the street leading to Saskatchewan Place was renamed Bill Hunter Avenue, while a minor-hockey arena in Edmonton also bears his name. Letter-writing campaigns in 1999 and 2000 attempted to get Hunter inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame as a builder, but were unsuccessful. In 2010, he was elected as an inaugural inductee into the new World Hockey Association Hall of Fame in the builders category.

<doc id="676516" wikidata="Q391161" url="?curid=676516" title="Black Adam">
<text>Black Adam (Teth-Adam) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. He was created by Otto Binder and C. C. Beck, and first appeared in the debut issue of Fawcett Comics&#x27; &quot;The Marvel Family&quot; comic book in December 1945. Since DC Comics licensed and acquired Fawcett&#x27;s characters in the 1970s, Black Adam has endured as one of the most popular archenemies of the superhero Captain Marvel / Shazam and the Marvel Family alongside Doctor Sivana and Mister Mind.

Black Adam was originally depicted as a supervillain and the ancient magical champion predecessor of Captain Marvel, who fought his way to modern times to challenge the hero and his Marvel Family associates. Since the turn of the 21st century, however, Black Adam has been redefined by DC Comics writers Jerry Ordway, Geoff Johns, and David S. Goyer as an ancient Kahndaqi and corrupted antihero attempting to clear his name and reputation. He came from a fictional Middle Eastern country named Kahndaq, located at the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula, and was portrayed as a hero who liberated his homeland from slavery. Featured roles in such comic book series as &quot;Justice Society of America&quot;, &quot;Villains United&quot;, &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, and &quot;52&quot; have elevated the character&#x27;s prominence in the DC Universe, culminating with DC&#x27;s 2021 line-wide &quot;Infinite Frontier&quot; relaunch, wherein he joins the Justice League. In 2009, Black Adam was ranked as IGN&#x27;s 16th-greatest comic book villain of all time.

Black Adam has been substantially adapted into media outside comics, including animated series, films, and video games. He has been voiced by John DiMaggio, Gary Cole, Joey Naber, and Fred Tatasciore, among others. Dwayne Johnson voiced Adam in &quot;DC League of Super-Pets&quot; before starring as him in the live-action film &quot;Black Adam&quot;.

In &quot;The Marvel Family&quot; #1, Black Adam is an ancient Egyptian named Teth-Adam (i.e., &quot;Mighty Human&quot;), who is chosen by the wizard Shazam to be his successor due to his presumed moral purity. This story is reprinted in DC&#x27;s &quot;Shazam!&quot; #8 (1973), which is his first appearance in the Bronze Age.
When Teth-Adam says the magic word &quot;Shazam&quot;, he is transformed into Mighty Adam, but is corrupted by power. Originally, the wizard Shazam grants Adam powers derived from ancient Greco-Roman deities; later in the series, it was changed to ancient Egyptian deities.

Deciding that he should rule the world, the Mighty Adam overthrows and kills the pharaoh and assumes the Egyptian throne. Angered by this betrayal, Shazam renames his errant champion Black Adam and—unable to revoke the powers he gave Adam—banishes him to the most distant star in the universe.

Black Adam spends the next 5,000 years flying back to Earth. By the time he makes it back, in 1945, Shazam has appointed three new champions to take his place: Captain Marvel, Captain Marvel Jr., and Mary Marvel. Adam&#x27;s attempts to take over the world cause the Marvels to seek counsel with Shazam, who tells them about Black Adam. Adam succeeds in gagging Billy and Freddy while they are talking to Shazam. He then ties them up, planning to kill them later. Uncle Marvel releases them while Mary battles Black Adam, enabling them to transform.

Adam does battle with the trio, known as the Marvel Family, but since all are equally invulnerable, the fight goes on without resolution. The non-powered Marvel Family member Uncle Marvel gets an idea from Shazam and tricks Adam into saying &quot;Shazam,&quot; reverting him to Teth-Adam. As he is no longer immortal, he dies and crumbles into a skeleton. Black Adam&#x27;s costume is almost identical to Captain Marvel&#x27;s—except that Black Adam&#x27;s costume is black and golden yellow, instead of red and golden yellow.

===DC Comics===
====Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot;====
Though Adam is defeated in the same story which he debuted, the DC version of Adam is resurrected and revitalized nearly 30 years later in Philadelphia by Doctor Sivana&#x27;s reincarnation machine in DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Shazam!&quot; revival of the Marvel Family characters. He then destroys the machine so it cannot be used against him, much to Sivana&#x27;s annoyance.

According to &quot;Shazam!&quot; #28 (Black Adam&#x27;s first &quot;Bronze Age&quot; appearance, but second actual appearance, after &quot;The Marvel Family #1&quot;) Black Adam gets his powers from Shu (stamina), Heryshaf (strength), Amon (power), Zehuti (Thoth) (wisdom), Anpu (speed), and Menthu (courage). Black Adam accidentally time-travels back to 1776 while going to the Rock of Eternity to destroy Shazam at Sivana&#x27;s request, as Sivana felt Adam&#x27;s powers would be wiped out as well, but Captain Marvel accidentally throws him back in time. He and Captain Marvel battle, during which Black Adam realizes he will have to do something drastic and tricky to defeat Marvel. Adam gets his transformative lightning to strike Captain Marvel, transforming Captain Marvel back to Billy. He then seizes Billy and covers his mouth before he can finish saying his magic word, &quot;SHAZAM!!&quot;.

He then flies to a nearby ship where he obtains a length of rope which he uses to bind and gag Billy, after which he throws him into the sea. However, Billy swims to the surface, and is rescued by a colonist rebel, and freed. He realizes the rebel is Paul Revere before returning to his own time. Adam comes to Captain Marvel to exact revenge, when during a short battle, Adam is once again tricked by Captain Marvel into saying &quot;Shazam.&quot; Adam then gets amnesia as a result of a powerful punch from Captain Marvel.

After that, Black Adam is also involved with Karmang in the &quot;All-New Collectors&#x27; Edition&quot; #C-58 (Black Adam&#x27;s third appearance, but second new appearance in the Bronze Age) and tries to destroy both Superman and Captain Marvel.

After several more defeats at Captain Marvel&#x27;s hands, Adam joins Mister Mind&#x27;s final pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; version of the Monster Society of Evil which stages an assault on the Rock of Eternity. The evil god of magic Oggar summons an evil army from the sands and dust of Egypt for Adam to lead after muting Billy with his magic. They escape, despite being defeated.

When last seen during &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Adam was fighting the heroes on the five remaining and partially merged Earths.

==Fictional character biography==
===&quot;The Power of Shazam!&quot;: revised origin===

Black Adam is reintroduced to the DC Universe in &quot;The Power of Shazam!&quot; graphic novel by Jerry Ordway in 1994 (an earlier Post-Crisis version of the character appeared in &quot;Shazam!: The New Beginning&quot; but this appearance is not considered canonical). In that story and the subsequent &quot;Power of Shazam!&quot; ongoing series, Adam is a deadly and evil adversary for Captain Marvel.

In this revised origin, Teth-Adam was born on September 11, 1279 BC. Teth-Adam is the son of the ancient Egyptian Pharaoh Ramesses II, and impresses one of the high priests, the wizard Shazam, with his good deeds. The wizard gives Teth-Adam the power to become the superhero the Mighty Adam by speaking the name &quot;Shazam&quot;, an acronym for the Mighty Adam&#x27;s powers: the stamina of Shu, the swiftness of Heru (Horus), the strength of Amon, the wisdom of Zehuti (Thoth), the power of Aton, and the courage of Mehen. He does not draw powers from Shazam due to the demoness Blaze making a deal with the Egyptian god Set.

The Mighty Adam serves as Egypt&#x27;s champion for many centuries but becomes corrupted by the charms of a mysterious woman, revealed to be Shazam&#x27;s evil daughter Blaze in disguise. The bewitched Adam is convinced that he and his mistress should rule Egypt, so he kills the Pharaoh and appoints himself ruler. Shazam learns of this and strips Adam of his powers, encasing them in a mystical scarab necklace. Adam&#x27;s depowered body rapidly experiences the aging process that the magic had staved off, and the former hero withers away into a dried cadaver in seconds.

Shazam buries both the body and the scarab in the tomb of Ramesses II, where he plans for it to remain for all eternity. In death, the former hero is referred to as &quot;Khem-Adam&quot; (&quot;Black Adam&quot;). Disillusioned by what he perceived as Adam&#x27;s betrayal, Shazam waits several millennia before appointing a second champion to fight evil in his name.

During the late 20th century, an unscrupulous archaeological aide named Theo Adam is assigned to the Malcolm Expedition, financed by the Sivana Foundation to excavate the tomb of Ramesses II. Adam uncovers Khem-Adam&#x27;s tomb in a secret passageway, and leads his superiors, C.C. Batson and his wife Marilyn, to the discovery. Upon first sight of Khem-Adam&#x27;s scarab, Theo Adam becomes obsessed with the artifact, and kills both Batsons to steal it. Escaping Egypt, Theo Adam soon made his way back to America.

The Batsons&#x27; son, Billy, has been left behind in the United States, and is drafted by Shazam to become the wizard&#x27;s second champion, Captain Marvel. When Theo Adam first encounters Captain Marvel, he notes both Marvel&#x27;s identical appearance to C.C. Batson and the lightning-bolt insignia on Marvel&#x27;s chest that had also decorated Khem-Adam&#x27;s tomb. Adam therefore has a revelation, and realizes that he is a reincarnation of Khem-Adam. Grasping his stolen scarab, Adam speaks Shazam&#x27;s name and is transformed into the super-powered Black Adam.

Black Adam reveals himself to Captain Marvel as the Batsons&#x27; killer, and the two battle. Captain Marvel emerges victorious by snatching Adam&#x27;s scarab, and therefore his power, away from him. However, he saves him from being crushed by a falling building. Marvel brings Theo Adam to Shazam, who wipes Adam&#x27;s memory and takes away his voice, so that he cannot access his powers. This solution proves temporary, as Blaze re-enters her former lover&#x27;s life and helps restore his voice, memory, and powers.

===&quot;JSA&quot; series: Black Adam reforms===
Although Adam appears during the &quot;Power of Shazam!&quot; ongoing series&#x27; first year of publication as a villain, towards the end of the series&#x27; run, Adam returns and announces that Black Adam and Theo Adam are separate personalities. Black Adam stands trial again for the murders of the Batsons, and is acquitted when it is revealed that his fingerprints do not match those of Theo Adam.

The reformed Black Adam is still vulnerable to his murderous host&#x27;s influence, and he attacks the Justice Society of America under Theo Adam&#x27;s control in &quot;JSA&quot; #6 (1999). In subsequent issues, Adam joins supervillain Johnny Sorrow&#x27;s Injustice Society after Sorrow removes a malignant tumor from Adam&#x27;s brain. He is sent to battle Wildcat, and easily defeats him, showing how easily he could kill him by taking him about 25,000 feet above the ground—just high enough for them to talk while unable to go any higher without the human Wildcat freezing or suffocating—explaining the different ways he could kill him, and asking what he will give for his life.

He shows him the Rock of Eternity where Sorrow has turned Shazam to stone with his cursed face that usually kills those that see him, also making contact with the Spectre, who provides them with additional information. Adam soon betrays Sorrow, and he and the JSA defeat the Injustice Society. Black Adam briefly gives Flash the speed of Heru enabling him to defeat Johnny Sorrow by hitting him at near-lightspeed when he is paralyzed after Doctor Mid-Nite showed Sorrow a previously recorded image of his own face, sending him from Earth to another dimension.

Flash meets Black Adam in the past, where he has been sent due to the great speed he traveled, and again uses his speed, this time to return to his own time. After the Flash returns, Black Adam helps the JSA battle the Sin-Eater, a Thanagarian demon. Claiming to be free of Theo&#x27;s evil influence again, a repentant Black Adam requests membership in the Justice Society, and is granted a probationary membership in &quot;JSA&quot; #21 (2002).

During their tenure on &quot;JSA&quot;, writers Geoff Johns and David S. Goyer redefined Adam&#x27;s personality and background, focusing on the character&#x27;s old-fashioned and militant ideals of justice, and his officious and strongly opinionated attitude. Despite this, he has stated on many occasions that he respects the Justice Society, particularly members such as Jay Garrick. Several other JSA members are shown to be skeptical of Adam&#x27;s reformation; primary among them is the Atom Smasher, who later becomes Adam&#x27;s close friend after Adam sympathizes with his decision to kill the near-immortal Extant to save his mother.

The writers also created added tension in the book by having Captain Marvel, who is wholly unconvinced that Adam has reformed, join the team. One &quot;JSA&quot; story arc (issues 39 through 44) features Marvel, Hawkgirl, and Mr. Terrific venturing back in time to ancient Egypt, where they meet the Mighty Adam before his corruption. During this visit, the Mighty Adam is grateful to meet Captain Marvel since Marvel&#x27;s presence demonstrates that his legacy will survive him even with his children gone.

When Marvel transforms back into Billy Batson, Adam expresses admiration for the young man&#x27;s ability to handle the power of Shazam at such a young age, something he doubts he could have achieved himself. After returning to the present, Marvel notes that he has a better understanding of Adam&#x27;s motives now after learning about the loss of Adam&#x27;s family. Adam rebuffs the offer, commenting that Marvel cannot truly understand him, stating that, while they are not enemies, they will never be friends.

Johns and Goyer used this story arc to slightly alter Adam&#x27;s origin. The hero now hails from the fictional west Asian nation of Kahndaq, not Egypt, although he serves the Egyptian prince Khufu (who is later reincarnated as JSA member Hawkman). The character of Blaze is completely removed from the origin story, and Adam&#x27;s rage is described as having resulted from the conquering of Kahndaq (and the murder of his wife and children) at the hands of a magically powered supervillain named Ahk-ton (whose powers resemble the future hero Metamorpho), who is working with the notorious immortal Vandal Savage. The Mighty Adam kills Ahk-ton during the struggle and returns to Kahndaq to reclaim it by any means necessary, including murder. The wizard Shazam does not agree with Adam&#x27;s actions, and robs Adam of his powers and kills him.

===&quot;JSA: Black Reign&quot;===
In &quot;JSA&quot; #45 (2003), Black Adam and his teammate Atom Smasher both defect from the Justice Society, expressing dissatisfaction with the team&#x27;s refusal to cross certain lines. During the next few issues, Adam forms his own organization, which administers justice the way Adam wants it: &quot;an eye for an eye&quot;. His roster includes a mix of DC heroes and villains, including Atom Smasher, Brainwave (who is possessed by Mister Mind), Northwind and the rest of the society of Feithera, Nemesis, and former JSA museum curator Alex Montez, the human host of the demon Eclipso. Adam&#x27;s collective executes Kobra, a villain who has been acquitted by the legal system (albeit because his followers had threatened to blow themselves up if he was not released) when the JSA could have spared them his escape and the hassle of a trial by simply killing Kobra when he was first captured. Adam then turns his attentions to his old homeland of Kahndaq, now ruled by a militant dictator whose actions had long been ignored by the United Nations.

Late 2003 began the publication of a &quot;JSA&quot;/&quot;Hawkman&quot; crossover story arc titled &quot;Black Reign&quot;, written by Geoff Johns alone, which features Adam and his militia&#x27;s hostile takeover of Kahndaq. A war soon breaks out, with Adam, his comrades, and the Kahndaqi people on one side, and the Justice Society on the other. The dictator is finally killed by Atom Smasher. By the end of the arc, the JSA leaves Adam in control of Kahndaq, provided that he does not leave its borders, convincing him that he cannot enforce his rule on the world or he is no better than the dictator he had defeated.

Brainwave is saved by the JSA, Mister Mind is apprehended thanks to the Atom infiltrating Brainwave&#x27;s head—as part of an undercover mission to confirm whether Adam was brainwashing his comrades—and Nemesis and Alex both die during the battle when Alex loses control of Eclipso. Only Northwind and Atom Smasher remain at Adam&#x27;s side, with Atom Smasher later leaving when a time-travelling clash with Degaton results in him meeting Al Pratt in the 1950s and re-evaluating his past motivations.

As Kahndaq&#x27;s ruler, Adam is depicted as fiercely working to protect his people and his nation, although his arrogance is still a handicap; when the Spectre attacked Kahndaq after being corrupted by Eclipso, Black Adam actually told his people that the JSA were also their enemy because he did not want to give his people the impression that he needed help to protect them, despite the fact that he was clearly outmatched by the Spectre&#x27;s power.

===&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;===
Black Adam is featured heavily in DC&#x27;s 2005 &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; crossover, primarily in the &quot;Villains United&quot; miniseries as a member of the Secret Society of Super Villains (which he only joins to protect Kahndaq from the Society). Concurrently, in &quot;JSA&quot;, Atom Smasher leaves Adam&#x27;s side to return to the JSA.

The Society is run by Alexander Luthor Jr., a character from the alternate world of Earth-Three, who disguises himself as the Lex Luthor of the Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; Earth. The &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; limited series centers around Alexander Luthor&#x27;s plan to restore the Multiverse. Needing a member of the Marvel Family to power the apparatus he has designed to recreate the alternate Earths of the Multiverse, Luthor has the Society betray and capture Black Adam. With the help of the mind-controlling powers of the Psycho-Pirate, Luthor is able to control Adam and have him call down the Shazam magic lightning bolt to fuel the apparatus.

The Spectre&#x27;s rampage during the &quot;Day of Vengeance&quot; storyline has reverted all magic in the DC Universe to a raw, chaotic structure, and the death of the wizard Shazam has transformed him into a tether that can be used to harness magic, allowing Alexander to use any member of the Marvel family to power his equipment if the wizard&#x27;s name is spoken. By the end of the miniseries, Black Adam is freed by Superboy and Nightwing. Adam quickly kills Psycho-Pirate and, following a failed attempt to defeat Superboy-Prime, he is transported to Earth-5 when he is punched too far from the Tower by Superboy-Prime. He joins the heroes in the Battle of Metropolis, destroying Amazo shortly after his arrival.

===&quot;52&quot;===
Black Adam appears as a featured character in DC&#x27;s weekly &quot;52&quot; comic book. Depicted as the violent protector of the nation of Kahndaq, Adam kills several supervillains in public and on television to demonstrate his views. As a result, he is distrusted by the superhuman community.

In &quot;52&quot;, DC introduces Adrianna Tomaz, the &quot;most beautiful slave from Egypt&quot; offered to Adam by Intergang as a token to curry his favor, along with $2,000,000 in African gold. Black Adam sends Intergang a message by killing Noose, by tearing his face apart, and sending the rest of the Intergang members home, leaving Adrianna behind.

During Week 10, he creates an international metahuman coalition against the perceived metahuman supremacy of the United States. He gets members of the Great Ten of China and Russia&#x27;s Rocket Reds, among others, to join the coalition. Adrianna begins to counsel him and stays as a refugee. She makes him a ruler who shows more mercy and performs charitable acts.

In Week 12 of the series, Adam gains a magical amulet, hidden on the scarab in which Shazam imprisoned him. With help from Captain Marvel, who first thinks Adam is trying to attack him, he transforms Adrianna into the superheroine Isis.

Four weeks later, in Week 16, he proposes with a jewel given to Cleopatra by Caesar, and the two are married, with Captain Marvel and the rest of the Marvel Family as witnesses, Mary as bridesmaid. Renee Montoya and the Question prevent a suicide bomber, a child sent by Intergang, from ruining the wedding. For this they are awarded the country&#x27;s highest honor, the Order of the Scarab, by Black Adam, although he is furious to find Renee is missing the ceremony while sleeping with a Kahndaqi woman from sorrow over killing a child.

In &quot;52&quot; Week 23, Black Adam and Isis, with the assistance of the Question and Renee Montoya, find Isis&#x27;s brother Amon. Due to a failed escape attempt, Amon suffers near-fatal wounds from repeated beatings, meaning that he will never walk again. To save his life, Black Adam bestows a portion of his own power on the boy, as Captain Marvel did for Captain Marvel Jr. Isis&#x27;s brother then becomes a new addition to the Black Marvel Family under the name Osiris. They help the Marvels beat the demonic Sabbac using their lightning strike on Halloween when he tries to sacrifice children to the demon Neron while several stories high. He is then moved to an unknown location. The Black Marvel Family also has a charity dinner with Venus Sivana, during which Osiris first meets a talking crocodile (whom Osiris names Sobek).

Osiris is accepted into the Teen Titans. Upon returning from a mission, he and the rest of the Black Marvel Family are attacked by the Suicide Squad. The Black Marvels defeat the Squad, but not before footage of them in battle (including Osiris&#x27;s accidental killing of a Squad member who was attacking Isis) is captured by Amanda Waller, who uses it to further ruin the Black Marvel Family&#x27;s reputation. Meanwhile, Kahndaq is struck by a number of natural disasters, which seem to have a supernatural origin. He engages in more beneficial activities, like a charity dinner with the Sivanas.

Wracked with guilt over the death of the Persuader, Osiris ventures to the Rock of Eternity and pleads with Captain Marvel to have his powers removed, as he fears Black Adam&#x27;s influence (and those of his gods) has tainted him with evil. Black Adam arrives and the two battle until subdued by Isis and the Marvels. Osiris relents, seemingly accepting that he has repented enough for the Persuader&#x27;s death, and accompanies the Black Marvel Family back home.

However, when Osiris and his friend Sobek, the talking crocodile, are alone, he admits that he was only putting up a front to appease those around him and that he could never forgive himself for killing anyone, as Black Adam has. Sobek advises Osiris that he should say Black Adam&#x27;s name and rid himself of the powers he has come to hate. Osiris does so, only to be betrayed and brutally devoured by Sobek, while in his mortal form.

Isis and Adam confront Sobek after finding Osiris&#x27;s body, who reveals that he is Famine, the Fourth Horseman of Apokolips, one of four creatures created by Intergang to attack Black Adam. Adam swiftly disposes of Sobek by hyper-elongating his jaws and does battle with the other three Horsemen. One of them, Pestilence, infects Isis with a deadly disease before Adam kills him and his partner War. A gravely ill Isis saves Adam from Death using her powers to send Death into the sky with a geyser of lava and tells Adam with her dying breath that she was wrong to try to change his views on justice, and that he should avenge both her and Osiris.

====&quot;World War III&quot;====

After the funeral in honor of his family, Adam attacks the neighboring Intergang-associated nation of Bialya in search of Death. Sick with grief over the death of his family, Adam proceeds to exterminate the entire 2,000,000-citizen population of Bialya in his hunt for his target. Upon confronting his family&#x27;s killer, the enraged Adam battles a greatly enhanced Death, who has been feeding on the slaughter of Bialya&#x27;s population. Despite his enhanced strength, Death is defeated by Adam with a barrage of mystic lightning. While torturing Death for an entire day, Adam learns the identity and whereabouts of the Horsemen&#x27;s masters, flying off to Oolong Island in search of the Science Squad.

He easily gets past their defenses, even a weapon equivalent to the meteorite that killed the dinosaurs proving incapable of stopping him. Adam is subdued by the scientists, who projected a dimensional field into his mind the size of a football field, rendering him powerless. They then use an electro-crown to re-route his body&#x27;s impulses and hold him as a prisoner. Dr. Sivana tortures Adam for weeks using the electrical crown, which only serves to enrage Adam further, who vows to tear them all apart.

The &quot;Science Squad&quot; makes a worldwide announcement that they plan to sell Black Adam as a living weapon to the highest bidder, resulting in the Justice Society assaulting the island to free Adam. It is revealed that Chang Tzu had built the Horsemen under orders of China, who wanted Adam and his family to be assassinated after Adam withdrew from the Freedom of Power Treaty. Adam refuses to be taken into custody for the destruction of Bialya, despite the requests of Atom-Smasher, once more flying off to seek revenge for the death of his family.

Enraged to the point of madness, Black Adam launched a week-long attack against the heroes of the world, referred to afterward as &quot;World War III&quot;. Tearing across the globe, Adam destroys many historical landmarks, including the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the Egyptian pyramids in his battle with dozens of superheroes who attempt to stop him. After fighting and defeating the Marvel Family, the Global Guardians, the Doom Patrol, and the Teen Titans, resulting in the deaths of Young Frankenstein and Terra, Adam&#x27;s path of destruction eventually moves through China. Adam&#x27;s sustained assault finally prompts the decimated Chinese superhero team the Great Ten to allow the Justice Society and a coalition of other American metahumans onto Chinese soil in an attempt to stop Adam.

Captain Marvel pleads with the Egyptian gods to stop Black Adam&#x27;s rampage, but the gods laughingly inform Marvel that Black Adam has their blessing. Although he failed to remove Black Adam&#x27;s powers, Captain Marvel gathers with a group of mystics, including Zatanna and the Phantom Stranger, to work a spell which would allow him to use his powers to transform Black Adam back to his human form instead of himself. Green Lantern (Alan Scott) and Power Girl restrained Black Adam as they dragged him into the lightning&#x27;s path, but the resulting blast tears him from their hands.

Teth-Adam, once again human, escaped with the aid of the Atom Smasher, who carried him to safety after saving him from his fall. After Adam was de-powered, Marvel also changed Adam&#x27;s magic word with his abilities as the new guardian of the Rock of Eternity, keeping it secret to prevent him from ever regaining his powers. Left mortal, Adam wandered the Middle East, attempting to guess the word that would restore his power.

===&quot;Countdown/Black Adam: The Dark Age&quot;===
Black Adam&#x27;s quest to gain his powers back between the events of &quot;52&quot; and &quot;Countdown&quot; was depicted in a six-issue miniseries entitled &quot;Black Adam: The Dark Age&quot;, published from late 2007 to early 2008. Sometime after his defeat in World War III, Adam gathers a small band of Kahndaqi men who still remain loyal to Adam and sneaks into a heavily guarded and war-torn Kahndaq in disguise (having had his minions beat him mercilessly to alter his appearance) to retrieve the bones of Isis. The men kill the guards at the tomb, and get Isis&#x27;s remains.

Most of Adam&#x27;s men perish in a battle with a band of soldiers waiting for Adam at the tomb, but Adam manages to escape with Isis&#x27;s remains. When the Justice Society later arrives at the scene following the shootout, Atom Smasher finds Isis&#x27;s left ring finger and wedding ring, which Adam accidentally dropped during his escape. One of Adam&#x27;s loyal servants, Hassan, the last one surviving, offers himself as food to Adam to help him survive across the mountains.

Adam takes Isis&#x27;s bones to a Lazarus Pit in the Himalayas with the intentions of using it to resurrect her, but cannot complete the process without either using all of Isis&#x27;s bones (including the missing ring finger) or her magical amulet, which has gone missing. He makes his way to Doctor Fate&#x27;s tower looking for the amulet, and finds the supervillain and sorcerer Felix Faust, who was trapped in the tower by Ralph Dibny during &quot;52&quot;. Faust reveals to Adam that Mary Marvel and Captain Marvel Jr. broke Isis&#x27;s amulet into several pieces and scattered them across the globe.

Realizing that Isis is powerful enough to free him from the tower, Faust agrees to help Adam locate the pieces of the amulet. He enacts a spell that allows Teth-Adam to transform into Black Adam by drawing from the residual magic in Isis&#x27;s bones, with Adam using her name as a magic word. However, Faust warns Adam to use his powers only when necessary, lest Adam drain all of Isis&#x27;s remaining power and make her resurrection impossible.

Using a homing signal etched into his hand by Faust, Adam sets out across the globe hunting down the pieces of Isis&#x27;s amulet. At the same time, the Justice Society is working with the Marvels to perfect a way of using the Shazam lightning bolt to track Black Adam and bring him to justice. In addition, a hired team of armed vigilantes covertly funded by the U.S. and several other nations is hunting Adam as well, and have developed an &quot;Eternity bullet&quot;—manufactured from shards of the Rock of Eternity—which can penetrate Adam&#x27;s skin and kill him.

Despite these challenges, Adam is able to retrieve all of the pieces of Isis&#x27;s amulet (and Atom Smasher meets with Adam in secret to give him Isis&#x27;s ring finger, though he keeps the ring to himself). Adam spends the entire quest reciting the names of streets, signs, locations, moods, and emotions in hopes of stumbling upon his new magic word. At the end of his quest, Teth-Adam walks into a Fawcett City malt shop and orders a chocolate egg cream—only to find that &quot;chocolate egg cream&quot; is what Captain Marvel changed his magic word to.

With his original powers restored, Adam flies to Fate&#x27;s Tower and confronts Faust. He tells Faust that if he crosses him, he will come after them. Faust attempts to resurrect Isis and apparently succeeds, but the resurrection fails, and Isis&#x27;s bones crumble to the floor after swearing eternal hate on her husband. Faust blames Black Adam for using Isis&#x27;s power too much, and distraught, Black Adam flies away, ending up in Gotham City. It is, however, revealed that the bones that Faust showed to Black Adam belonged to Ralph Dibny, and Faust resurrects Isis. With her under his power, Faust creates a door, and exits the tower.

In &quot;Countdown&quot; #47 (June 2007), a de-powered Mary Marvel who is being chased by criminals stumbles upon Black Adam, hiding out at the former Kahndaqi embassy in Gotham City, kills the criminals, and she finds that he has killed several others that have had the misfortune to find their way into the building. It appears that Adam is about to harm Mary as well as he starts strangling her, but instead, he transfers all of his powers to her (including those he recovered from Isis). He departs in his mortal form after she frees him from a wall that has toppled on him.

===&quot;Final Crisis&quot;===
Black Adam is featured in &quot;Final Crisis&quot; #5, assisting a small group of Earth&#x27;s heroes, many of whom he fought before, in battling against Darkseid&#x27;s forces. Black Adam battles Mary Marvel and perceives a &quot;leering old man&quot; inside of her. He attempts to kill her but is stopped by Tawky Tawny and Shazam (Freddy Freeman). Adam is subdued by enemy forces.

===&quot;Justice Society of America&quot;===
A brooding, disparaged Black Adam appears in &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; vol. 3 #16 (2008), hiding in the tomb of Isis and Osiris and killing potential looters, along with sleeping in the coffins. He reveals through narration that the whole meaning of his power transfer to Mary Marvel was the hope that her innocence would eventually force Mary into surrendering back his power to him, but changed enough to allow Isis&#x27;s rebirth. After the attempt failed, Adam returned to his state of mourning and anger. Adam&#x27;s mourning is cut short, however, when he discovers a bloodied flower in his shrine, believing it a sign from Isis.

Despite her powers and consciousness being heavily sedated by Felix Faust&#x27;s spells, Isis manages to use her powers to create a trail of flowers (including a batch in the shape of the Shazam magic lightning bolt symbol) to lead Adam to where Faust has been holding her captive. Finding Isis and freeing her from Faust&#x27;s control, Black Adam then journeys to the Rock of Eternity and battles Billy Batson (now Marvel, the wizard of the Rock of Eternity, rather than Captain Marvel), using the same scarab necklace that once imprisoned him to strip Billy of his powers, with help from Isis sending lightning at Marvel and using them to take control of the Rock of Eternity. Isis plans to use the power of the Rock to &quot;cleanse the earth&quot; of all of humankind, which she sees as irrevocably evil. Black Adam and Isis are even able to convince Mary Marvel to join their crusade. The Black Marvels are soon challenged by the Justice Society, who has come to the aid of the powerless Billy Batson when he was trying to summon Freddy. During the course of the fight, the combatants end up in Kahndaq, where the people praise Black Adam&#x27;s return. Isis then kills several of the followers, claiming that they are tainted by this new Earth. Black Adam attempts to protect his people, only to be attacked by Mary and Billy, who had been tainted by Mary&#x27;s power. At that point, Jay Garrick (who had earlier been thrown by Isis into the mists surrounding the Rock of Eternity) appears with the spirit of Billy&#x27;s father, and Shazam, whom the two had recovered from the Rock of Finality, where he had been imprisoned in a statue. Adam is convinced to return his power to Shazam, so that he could save Isis from her corruption. In turn, Shazam—who is furious at the misuse of the power he behest on his champions—takes the power from Isis, Billy, and Mary, and transforms Teth-Adam and Adrianna into statues. Sometime later, a shadowy figure appears in a bolt of lightning, gloating that Shazam has given him new champions to play with.

After the &quot;Blackest Night&quot; storyline, the resurrected Osiris returns to Kahndaq, vowing to restore the kingdom to its former prosperity. Osiris takes the petrified bodies of Adam and Isis and flies off to an unknown destination. After failing to revive Adam and Adriana, Osiris enlists in Deathstroke&#x27;s new team of Titans in hopes of finding a way to save them. He has been told to resurrect Isis, but not Adam, which he does by killing people with his lightning by saying Isis.

===&quot;The New 52&quot; (2011–2016)===

In &quot;The New 52&quot; (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Black Adam was mentioned by Dr. Sivana while listening to witness reports of the wizard Shazam. Sivana mentions that Black Adam was a slave who was teleported from his prison cell to the Rock of Eternity and granted his powers by the wizard. Adam then went on to save Kahndaq from the Seven Deadly Sins before vanishing. During Dr. Sivana&#x27;s explanation, drawings of Black Adam are shown in a historical text, displaying a slightly different look from his previous incarnations. Dr. Sivana later uses his new-found magic eye inside of some ruins to read a magically hidden hieroglyph that makes the wall explode, releasing Black Adam from his tomb. Adam is then shown in a revamped version of his original costume, which includes a cape, hood, and a metallic belt instead of a sash. His lightning bolt appears as an opening into his body with magical energy visibly inside of him.

In Black Adam&#x27;s subsequent pursuit of Shazam, Billy is shown the beginning of Black Adam&#x27;s origin. It centers around the story of Aman, a Kahndaqi boy who was thrust into abuse and slavery long ago. Thinking that he can surely relate and connect with another boy who has suffered like he has, Billy (without hearing the rest of the tale) rushes to Black Adam and tries to reason with him. To his surprise, Black Adam simply grabs him and tells him he &quot;knows nothing&quot;.

Black Adam shows Billy the rest of his origin, which reveals that Aman had an uncle (who helped Aman escape slavery), whose name was Adam. Adam was injured during their escape, and when Aman was chosen by the wizard to be his champion, Aman shared his power with Adam to heal him. Afterwards, although Aman wanted to use his new power to help his people and cure his former slave masters of their evil souls, Adam only sought vengeance against those who had enslaved them. To this end, when Aman called down the lightning, Adam seemingly killed Aman so that he himself was the sole recipient of the power. However, the details of Aman&#x27;s &quot;death&quot; are not shown, leaving his fate open to speculation. Black Adam refers to Aman&#x27;s &quot;sacrifice&quot;, and tells Billy that he will go to any lengths to &quot;free this world from those who enslave it&quot;.

In the finale of Shazam&#x27;s origin story, Black Adam holds Billy&#x27;s foster siblings hostage and demands he give up his power, or they will die. But instead of giving Black Adam his power, he shares it with his foster siblings, empowering them as &quot;Shazams&quot;, as well. Together, they fight Black Adam and the &quot;host&quot; that the seven sins have inhabited. Eventually, the collateral damage endangers civilians, so Billy orders them to save the people while he alone battles Black Adam. He finally realizes that his knowledge of his newly acquired powers cannot defeat Adam, who has much more experience using his magic, and decides to change back into his child form. As normal teenager Billy, he challenges Black Adam to also change (into Teth-Adam) to make it a &quot;fair&quot; fight. After some convincing, he does so, but because he has been alive for centuries due only to his &quot;Black Adam form&quot;, as a normal human he quickly ages and turns to dust.

During the &quot;Forever Evil&quot; storyline, revolutionaries in Kahndaq use an ancient scroll to attempt to revive Black Adam so he will be their champion once again to save them from their oppressive ruler. A man named Amon begins to read the ancient spell, but before he can complete it, the military attacks them. Amon, injured, makes his sister Adrianna complete the spell, which revives Black Adam. He proceeds to defeat the military forces and kills the Kahndaqi ruler. Acting as Kahndaq&#x27;s protector again, Black Adam sees the Crime Syndicate&#x27;s message &quot;The World is Ours&quot; and gets angered saying &quot;this world belongs to no one!&quot; When Jimmy Olsen activates his Superman signal watch when confronted by Ultraman, Black Adam answers the call and ends up fighting Ultraman. Ultraman manages to defeat Black Adam by breaking his jaw and throws him unconscious into the ocean. Black Manta managed to fish Black Adam out of the ocean when he meets up with Lex Luthor. Lex Luthor works on resuscitating Black Adam. When it comes to the final battle against the Crime Syndicate, Black Adam and Sinestro move the Moon where the Sun ends up weakening Ultraman. In the aftermath of the battle against the Crime Syndicate, it was stated that the villains who helped to stop the Crime Syndicate would have their criminal records wiped. Black Adam and Sinestro did not care about that and went their separate ways, along with the other villains.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot; (2016–2018)===
In 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to &quot;The New 52&quot;. Black Adam appears in the &quot;Dark Nights: Metal&quot; miniseries. He is revealed to be a member of the Council of the Immortals, a group with the oldest beings of Earth, such as Vandal Savage and Hawkgirl. Black Adam supposedly kills Doctor Fate at the Rock of Eternity while in a fight against him, Wonder Woman, and Hawkgirl, who is by that point transformed by Barbatos into an evil version of herself named Lady Blackhawk.

When Billy and his family stumble upon the doors to the various Magiclands and go to the Funland, Black Adam arrives at the Rock of Eternity some time after their departure, noting that the Council of Eternity sealed off the Magiclands for a reason, that the door to the Monsterland is still sealed for now, and that Billy has no idea what he has done.

In the &quot;Watchmen&quot; sequel &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, Black Adam takes advantage of &quot;the Superman Theory&quot; and the metahuman arms race where he &quot;saves&quot; the Creeper from Kobra&#x27;s cult and allows any metahuman refugees to seek asylum in Kahndaq. He and the Creeper later attack Israel. Then he, the Creeper, and Giganta attacked the United Nations and fought Wonder Woman. When Wonder Woman took down Giganta, Black Adam engaged Wonder Woman. Following a news report where it was mentioned that the Amazons crashed the battle and forcefully took Wonder Woman back to Themyscira, Black Adam made his next move on the White House. He, the Creeper, and Giganta were now accompanied by Doc Dread, Killer Frost, Lady Clayface, the Man-Bat, Manhunter, Sandstorm, and Stingaree. Superman confronts Black Adam&#x27;s group until the part where Superman has his foreseen encounter with Doctor Manhattan. When the People&#x27;s Heroes, the Outsiders, and the Doomed appear with plans to make Superman pay for his involvement in the incident that occurred in Russia, Black Adam leads his group into getting to Superman first. Black Adam and his group are eventually defeated when Superman receives support from the Legion of Super-Heroes and the Justice Society of America. On Black Adam&#x27;s part, he was taken down by Jakeem Thunder and Johnny Thunderbolt.

In order for Black Adam to distract the Shazam Family while he and Doctor Sivana went to the Monsterlands to free the Monster Society of Evil, Mister Mind summoned the Seven Deadly Enemies of Man who assist him in attacking Shazam and Lady Shazam up to the point where Shazam shared his powers with his biological father C.C. Batson. There was a flux in the powers between C.C. Batson and Mary Bromfield that affected their fight with Black Adam and the Seven Deadly Enemies of Man. This went back and forth until the Wizard teleported them to Wozenderlands before Black Adam and the Seven Deadly Enemies of Man can do their next attack. After C.C. uses his powers to send Mamaragan back to the Rock of Eternity, Black Adam arrives and starts to strangle C.C. while stating that he is with Mister Mind in his plot. C.C. starts to cast a spell to separate Black Adam&#x27;s soul from his body and send it to the Darklands. He will be torn between realms as a way for him to see his family again. It turned out that C.C. is the real host of Mister Mind. The Shazam Family comments on the magic used on Black Adam when they see his body prior to their fight with the Monster Society of Evil. Scapegoat and Red Queen note that Black Adam is immobilized as he refused to follow Mister Mind. When Mister Mind was defeated, the spell on Black Adam was broken as he helps Shazam to fight Superboy-Prime. While blaming Billy for opening the doors to the Magiclands, Black Adam advises Shazam to undo the spell that would unite the Magiclands into one. Both of them quoted &quot;Shazam&quot; to take out Superboy-Prime, realizing that he was still somewhat vulnerable to magic but needing to use greater power to actively defeat him. As Adam is starting to turn to dust, Shazam was able to restore him by reclaiming the powers he placed in C.C. Batson. Once the spell was undone, Black Adam flew off advising Shazam not to open the doors to the Magiclands again. Mamaragan later notes that Shazam will see that Black Adam will eventually get a full redemption.

===New Justice (2018-2021)===
During the &quot;Endless Winter&quot; storyline, Black Adam was once freed in the 10th century by Hippolyta, Swamp Thing, and Viking Prince to help deal with the Frost King. When Flash is attacked by the Frost King&#x27;s ice monsters, he is saved by Black Adam. Black Adam, Silver Banshee, Catman, Icicle, Rampage, and Multiplex arrive at the Stagg Enterprises facility in Gotham City where Frost King&#x27;s family is kept in stasis. Multiplex tries helping Black Adam, but he overexhausts himself and Frost King kills Multiplex. Black Adam threatens to kill Frost King&#x27;s family. While Frost King is distracted, Sebastian Stagg sends out a robot that can fire cold fusion cannons, but it makes the Frost King stronger instead. Just before Black Adam is killed, Superman, Wonder Woman, the Flash, Batman, and Green Lantern arrive. When it turns out that the Frost King&#x27;s real body was trapped in the Fortress of Solitude, Superman prevents Black Adam from killing him. When the Frost King is seemingly destroyed in an explosion, Black Adam leaves while swearing vengeance on Superman.

===&quot;Infinite Frontier&quot; (2021–2023)===
In &quot;Infinite Frontier&quot;, Black Adam joins the Justice League and attempts to turn over a new leaf, harkening back to the lessons Adrianna had taught him. He began acting more as a protector than an avenger, which attracted the attention of Superman, who believed that the Justice League needed fresh perspectives.

On the anniversary of Adrianna&#x27;s death, Adam visited her grave, reflecting on what she&#x27;d tried to impart on him. While doing so, he was attacked by Brutus, an invader from another world. After the conflict with Brutus concludes, Adam joins the League.
==Powers and abilities==
As an ordinary human being, Black Adam is a skilled martial artist and is a master of Dhritishastra, a fictional Indian combat system created by Vandal Savage in which can only be mastered by immortals due to its complexity. Furthermore, Black Adam&#x27;s intimidating presence and formidable abilities has led to his induction into the Sinestro Corps for a time.

=== Magical abilities ===
Empowered by the Wizard Shazam, Black Adam is considered a formidable entity, remarked to possessing Alpha-level powers, being among the most dangerous men on Earth, and being considered one of Earth&#x27;s most foremost wielders of magic. Similarly to Billy Batson, he can shift between his human form and a empowered demi-god like form by saying the magic word (&quot;Shazam!&quot;). In this endowed form, he possess enhanced senses among other powers.

==== Powers of Shazam ====
==== Living Lightning ====
In the current continuity, the mystical abilities the character possess originates from the Living Lightning, a unique form of magic connected to the Wizard Shazam&#x27;s being and lifeforce often in the form of lightning. The Living Lightning grants additional, separate powers of its own; it allows for lightning control, usage of certain spells in circumstances, and can enhance the power of magic spells, healing abilities, and strength. This power is also among the only known supernatural forces capable of directly countering energies originating from the Great Darkness.

==== Magical manipulation and spell-casting ====
Both aspects of the Power of Shazam and Living Lightning similarly grant powers involving the usage of spells and magical manipulation; Black Adam is capable of bestowing a portion of his power to others in both continuities, granting them empowered forms and powers derived from those associated within his Egyptian-based pantheon. His capability to share his power is more advanced than Billy, being able to spread his power towards countless numerous heroes during a time of crisis. Adam has an affinity for magic and has knowledge on several different magic, displaying abilities such as absorbing knowledge to learn languages and can track the location of others using blood from other beings and/or creatures.

<doc id="676518" wikidata="Q4778904" url="?curid=676518" title="Apache Chief">
<text>Apache Chief is a Native American superhero from the various Hanna-Barbera &quot;Super Friends&quot; and &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot; cartoons and the DC comic book series of the same name. He was one of the new heroes added (along with Black Vulcan, El Dorado and Samurai) to increase the number of non-white characters in the Super Friends&#x27; ranks. The visual look of the character was created by cartoonist Alex Toth, who designed many superheroes for Hanna-Barbera beginning in the 1960s. He was voiced by Michael Rye in most of his &quot;Super Friends&quot; appearances, Regis Cordic in his debut appearance, Al Fann in &quot;History of Doom&quot;, and Maurice LaMarche in &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot;.

In the &quot;Challenge of the Superfriends&quot; series, Apache Chief was seen in every episode except one, but had spoken lines in only nine out of the sixteen episodes of the series. His arch-enemy from the Legion of Doom was Giganta, who was originally an enemy of Wonder Woman.

==Fictional character biography==
===&quot;Super Friends&quot;===
Apache Chief first appears in &quot;The All-New Super Friends Hour&quot;, voiced initially by Regis Cordic and later by Michael Rye, who reprises the role in &quot;Challenge of the Superfriends&quot;. Apache Chief&#x27;s origin, shown as a recording in the episode &quot;History of Doom&quot;, was thus: while still a young brave, he went for a walk with a Native American Elder, who was also his mentor. The two men are quickly attacked by a grizzly bear, but the Elder, recognizing that the young brave might be ready for a test such as this, gives the younger man a pouch of a special magic powder which will amplify the user&#x27;s thoughts and abilities a hundredfold. The young man resolves to be strong and brave (heeding the Elder&#x27;s advice that whatever is in his mind at the time will be amplified by the powder), and upon sprinkling himself with the powder and invoking the magic phrase grows to fifty feet in size, becoming stronger and braver. He disposes of the bear without violence, proving that he has passed the test. However, a girl horseback riding witnesses the entire affair, hoping to use the powder to become big and famous, and uses her lasso to steal the pouch. Despite the Elder telling her that her thoughts were evil, she uses the magic powder on herself and becomes the evil Giganta, proclaiming: &quot;The Medicine Man was right, Apache Chief! Your fifty feet of good are now matched by my fifty feet of evil!&quot;.

===&quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot;===
Apache Chief returns in &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot;, voiced by Maurice LaMarche. Having taken on various odd jobs in addition to his superheroics after being fired from the Super Friends, he develops a fear of coffee and other such hot liquids after being doused in the lap with one such cup in his debut episode &quot;Very Personal Injury&quot; had temporarily lead to him losing his ability to physically change in size, at the end of the episode forming the &quot;Multi-Culture Pals&quot; with Black Vulcan and Jesse Jackson after regaining his powers thanks to the physical appearance of Sybil Scussler, whom he goes on to date. In the series finale, &quot;The Death of Harvey&quot;, Apache Chief is once again doused again with coffee and burned shortly after his case is retried.

==Powers and abilities==
By speaking the words &quot;inee choh&quot;, which are the Western Apache words meaning &quot;man big&quot;, Apache Chief could grow to unlimited sizes. In the episode &quot;Colossus&quot;, Apache Chief grows to many times the size of the Earth, making himself able to battle the Colossus, a titanic space creature that plucked Earth from its orbit and placed it in a small (relative to him) glass bottle. Originally his tribal powers limited his growth to only 50 feet tall, but in one episode, &quot;Man in the Moon&quot;, he used the Atom&#x27;s knowledge of atomic size and was able to increase his growing to unlimited size. He was then able to grow to 1/5 the size of the earth, with one foot the size of the entire eastern United States and defeated the creature, sending it back inside the moon.

He also spoke in stereotypical &quot;Native American English&quot; and recited vaguely Native American philosophy. In the 1978 episodes &quot;Revenge on Gorilla City&quot; and &quot;The Time Trap&quot;, and the 1984 short episode entitled &quot;The Village of Lost Souls&quot;, Apache Chief also has exceptional tracking ability.

==Other versions==
* A character inspired by Apache Chief named Long Shadow appears in &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;, voiced by Gregg Rainwater. Possessing enhanced hearing along with the ability to grow several stories high, Long Shadow is a genetically engineered superhero created by Project Cadmus to serve as a member of their Ultimen and work independently of the Justice League, though the former group are led to believe that they are regular metahumans. In the episode &quot;Ultimatum&quot;, the Ultimen have several encounters with the League, during which Long Shadow expresses interest in joining them and catches Wonder Woman&#x27;s attention while his teammates focus on reaping material rewards for their work. After discovering the truth behind their creation and that they are suffering from cellular breakdown, Long Shadow reluctantly joins the other Ultimen in attacking their manager, Maxwell Lord, in an attempt to find Cadmus member Amanda Waller, but later defects to the League and helps them defeat his former teammates. Cadmus retakes custody of most of the Ultimen, but Wonder Woman and Batman convince them to let Long Shadow remain with the League for the remainder of his life. In the episode &quot;Panic in the Sky&quot;, Cadmus utilizes an army of Ultimen clones in their siege on the League&#x27;s Watchtower.
* A version of Long Shadow appears as Tye Longshadow in &quot;Young Justice&quot;, with Gregg Rainwater reprising the voice. He is descended from a long line of Apache chiefs, including his grandfather, Holling Longshadow (Michael Horse), an elderly Native American who lives in an RV park called Happy Trails. Tye is a friend of Jaime Reyes. While running away from home, Tye is captured and experimented on by the Reach, who activate his meta-gene, granting him the ability to project an &quot;astral&quot; version of himself that can grow several stories tall. The Team rescue Tye and his fellow captives and place some of them in S.T.A.R. Labs&#x27; custody, but he joins Virgil Hawkins, Asami Koizumi, and Ed Dorado in escaping. In the process, they are unknowingly manipulated by Lex Luthor into helping the Light until Arsenal reveals the truth to the four. After helping the Team and the Justice League thwart the Reach&#x27;s invasion of Earth, Tye returns to his regular life to live with his mother. As of the third season, he and Asami have begun dating.

==In other media==
===Comics===
In the comics, a somewhat similar character called Manitou Raven was created, as an homage to him, and joined the canonical JLA. Both Manitou Raven and his widow, Manitou Dawn, have been shown to use &quot;inuk chuk&quot; when casting spells or invoking powers.

===Film===
* Apache Chief makes a cameo appearance in &quot;Scooby-Doo! Mask of the Blue Falcon&quot;.
* Apache Chief makes a cameo appearance in &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot;.

==In popular culture==
* Apache Chief makes a cameo appearance in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;PTV&quot;.
* A parody of Apache Chief, named in art books as Giant Indian and unnamed in the series itself, appears in &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot;, voiced by Chris McCulloch.

===Merchandise===
* Apache Chief received a &quot;Collect &amp; Connect&quot; build-a-figure in series 18 of Mattel&#x27;s DC Universe Classics.
* Apache Chief received a Lego minifigure in &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot; tie-in toy line.

<doc id="676520" wikidata="Q2466726" url="?curid=676520" title="Cyborg (DC Comics)">
<text>Cyborg (Victor &quot;Vic&quot; Stone) is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by writer Marv Wolfman and artist George Pérez, and first appeared in an insert preview in &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #26 (October 1980). Cyborg is an important member of the Teen Titans, introduced ahead of the Titans&#x27; critically acclaimed &quot;New Teen Titans&quot; relaunch in 1980. For a brief period in the 2010s, Cyborg was reimagined as a founding member of the DC&#x27;s flagship Justice League superhero lineup (in line with some of the character&#x27;s appearances in live action adaptations) although these changes were later removed from continuity. 

Cyborg made his live-action debut in the television series &quot;Smallville&quot;, portrayed by Lee Thompson Young. Ray Fisher portrayed the character in the DC Extended Universe films &quot;Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; (2016), &quot;Justice League&quot; (2017), and &quot;Zack Snyder&#x27;s Justice League&quot; (2021) while Joivan Wade portrayed Cyborg in the television series &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; and in the fourth season of &quot;Titans&quot;. In animated media, the character has made his debut in the animated series Super Friends, he has been voiced through the animated media by Ernie Hudson, Khary Payton, Bumper Robinson, Shemar Moore and Zeno Robinson.

==Development==
In an interview, Perez described his design approach for the character. &quot;In the case of Cyborg I was inspired visually -and I think it is obvious from the head- by Deathlok... then I decided to make him more robotic than android by making more metallic parts of him, so that he wasn&#x27;t quite as human... but the half-face metallic plate was obviously inspired by Deathlok by Rich Buckler, and then I used a young Jim Brown as my inspiration for how I would handle the body language for the character.&quot;

==Character biography==

Victor Stone is the son of Silas Stone and Elinore Stone, scientists who use him as a test subject for various intelligence enhancement projects. While these treatments are ultimately successful and Victor&#x27;s IQ subsequently grows to genius levels, he grows to resent his treatment.

Victor strikes up a friendship with Ron Evers, a young miscreant who leads him into trouble with the law. This is the beginning of a struggle in which Victor strives for independence, engaging in pursuits of which his parents disapprove, such as athletics and abandoning his studies. Victor&#x27;s association with underage criminals leads him down a dark path in which he is often injured, but he still lives a &quot;normal&quot; life in which he is able to make his own decisions. However, this rebellious path does not bury Victor&#x27;s conscience considering that he refuses to participate in Evers&#x27; grandiose plans of racially motivated terrorism.

Victor&#x27;s situation changes radically when he visits his parents&#x27; lab where experiments in inter-dimensional access are done. At that moment of his entry, an aggressive gelatinous creature was accidentally pulled through and Victor&#x27;s mother is killed by it. It then turned on Victor and he was severely injured by its attack before his father was able to send it back to its native dimension.

With his wife dead and his son mutilated, unconscious and near death from the incident, Silas is driven to take advantage of his prototype medical prosthetic research to treat Victor. Unfortunately, Victor only regains consciousness after the extensive artificial limbs and implants were installed in his body without his consent. Victor was horrified at the discovery of the metallic components, which involve most of the left side of his head and face, and raged that he would rather have died than be such a victim of his father&#x27;s manipulations.

Although his bitterness remained for some time, Victor eventually calmed down enough to successfully adjust to his implants physically. He found himself rejected by the public because of his implants, including his girlfriend, who would later thoughtlessly blurt out that she would prefer he had died instead of being in that state. However, Victor&#x27;s conscience was unbowed, as evidenced by the fact that when Evers tried to manipulate him into participating in a terrorist attack on the United Nations, Victor decided to equip himself with his weaponized attachments and stop him on the top of United Nations Headquarters.

===Teen Titans===
When Raven assembles the Teen Titans, Victor joins initially for the benefit of a support group of kindred spirits and freaks, and has remained with that group ever since. Fortunately, Victor eventually finds additional new civilian friends such as a group of juveniles who are adjusting to their own prosthetics and idolize him because of his fancy parts and his exciting adventures. It also turns out that their beautiful teacher Sarah Simms, who has often assisted Cyborg and the Titans, admires him as well.

Another person who sees past the cybernetic shell is Dr. Sarah Charles, a S.T.A.R. Labs scientist who helps him to recuperate after having his cybernetic parts replaced. Cyborg and Dr. Charles date for some time and she, along with Changeling, keeps trying to reach him when he is seemingly mindless following the severe injuries he incurs during the &quot;Titans Hunt&quot; storyline.

===Deaths and rebirths===

Although Cyborg&#x27;s body was repaired by a team of Russian scientists after the missile crash he had been in, albeit with more mechanical parts than previously, his mind was not. Eventually, his mind was restored by an alien race of computer intelligences called the Technis, created from the sexual union of Swamp Thing and a machine-planet when Swamp Thing was travelling through space. Cyborg, however, had to remain with the Technis both to maintain his mind and because, in return for restoring him, he had to teach them about humanity. He took the name Cyberion, and gradually started becoming less human in outlook, connecting entirely to the Technis planet.

Eventually, Cyberion returned to Earth, establishing a Technis construct on the moon and a smaller base on Earth. With Victor&#x27;s consciousness dormant, but his desire for companionship controlling the actions of the Technis&#x27; planet, it began kidnapping former Titans members, his conscious mind so suppressed that he was not only searching for deceased Titans, but even sent one probe looking for himself as Cyborg. He ended up plugging them into virtual reality scenarios, representing what he believed to be their &quot;perfect worlds&quot;; for example, Beast Boy was back with the Doom Patrol, Damage was spending time being congratulated by the Justice Society as a true hero, and Nightwing was confronted by a Batman who actually smiled and offered to talk about their relationship. Although the Titans were freed, there was a strong disagreement between them and the Justice League over what action to take; the League believed that there was nothing left of Victor to save, whereas the Titans were willing to try, culminating in a brief battle, where the Atom and Catwoman (who had followed the Justice League to investigate) sided with the League while the Flash fought with the Titans, until the two were convinced to work together after Batman and Nightwing found the system containing Victor&#x27;s core consciousness. While Victor was distracted trying to aid his friends, a Titans team consisting of Changeling and the original five Titans were sent by Raven to try making contact with Victor&#x27;s human side, while Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, the Martian Manhunter, Power Girl, Captain Marvel, and Mary Marvel moved the moon back to its proper place. Eventually, thanks primarily to Changeling&#x27;s encouragement, and Omen and Raven holding Victor together long enough to come up with a plan, Victor&#x27;s consciousness was restored, and &quot;downloaded&quot; into the Omegadrome, a morphing war-suit belonging to former Titan Minion. In the wake of this event, the Titans reformed and Victor was part of the new group. However, he felt less human than ever before.

Shortly after this, Nightwing revealed he had cloned Victor&#x27;s body, and by flowing the Omegadrome through the clone, Victor regained his human form, but still had the abilities of the Omegadrome. He often used the Omegadrome to recreate his original look in battle. With his newfound humanity, Victor took a leave of absence, moving first to Los Angeles with Beast Boy and then to Central City. While in Central City, Victor was involved in one of the Thinker&#x27;s schemes, helping Wally hack the Thinker&#x27;s attempt to plug himself into the minds of Central City&#x27;s population so that Wally could outthink his opponent, though Victor lost the abilities of the Omegadrome in the process.

===Mentor===
Victor mentored the new incarnation of the Teen Titans, consisting mainly of sidekicks, most of whom have taken over the identities of former members (i.e. Tim Drake, the third Robin, instead of Dick Grayson, the original Robin and Titans leader), as well as stalwarts such as Starfire, Raven, and Beast Boy, where they have fought enemies such as Deathstroke, Brother Blood, Doctor Light, The Titans Tomorrow, and a brainwashed Superboy and Indigo during a team up with the Outsiders in the &quot;Insiders&quot; storyline. In the end, Cyborg was the only one capable of standing up to Dr. Light, thanks to his solar shields, although he makes it clear that he only won the fight because the rest of the Titans had softened Light up first.

===&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; and beyond===
During the 2005–2006 storyline &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Cyborg joined Donna&#x27;s &quot;New Cronus&quot; team that went to investigate a hole in the universe that was found during the &quot;Rann-Thanagar War&quot;. He left Beast Boy in charge of the Titans while he was gone. They arrived at the reset center of the universe and with the help of assorted heroes aided in the defeat of Alexander Luthor, who was attempting to recreate the multiverse and build a perfect Earth from it.

According to &quot;52&quot; Week 5, Cyborg was fused with Firestorm after returning to Earth. This was caused by the energy ripples caused by Alexander Luthor Jr. which altered the Zeta Beams the heroes were going to use to return home.

After being severely damaged during &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Cyborg was rebuilt over time in thanks to Tower caretakers Wendy and Marvin. He awoke a year later to find a wholly different Teen Titans being led by Robin, the only member from the team he formed prior to going into space. He is still a member of the team, but feels that Kid Devil and Ravager are hardly worthy Titans, and thus is attempting to find a way to reform &quot;the real Titans&quot;.

After the team along with the Doom Patrol defeated the Brotherhood of Evil, Cyborg asked Beast Boy to rejoin the Titans, but Gar refused, saying that his skills were needed with the Doom Patrol. After returning to Titans Tower, Cyborg began reviewing the security tapes during the last year, in which it appears that he was looked to by all the Titans of the past year for a shoulder to lean on, despite being in a coma-like state.

It appears that although Cyborg has returned to the team, the role of leader is now in the hands of Robin. He does however retain the position of statesman amongst the team and occasionally plays second-in-command.

In &quot;Justice League of America&quot; (vol. 2) #3, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Superman agree that Cyborg should be offered membership in the new Justice League. However, following a battle against Amazo, Green Lantern and Black Canary take over the formation of the JLA, and Cyborg is not amongst the roster.

In the &quot;Teen Titans East&quot; one-shot, Cyborg gathered together a new team of Titans. During a training exercise, the group was attacked by Trigon, and Cyborg was blasted by a giant energy beam. He was last seen in a crater, with only his head and torso remaining.

===Titans===
In the aftermath of Trigon&#x27;s assault in the &quot;Titans East&quot; one shot, Cyborg has been placed into a special hoverchair while he recuperates. Cyborg&#x27;s body is completely repaired in &quot;Titans&quot; (vol. 2) #5. Soon after, the resurrected and unbalanced Jericho enters Cyborg&#x27;s body, using him to manipulate the defenses at Titans Tower to kill the Teen Titans. Jericho&#x27;s plans are foiled when Static, the newest Teen Titan, uses his electrical powers to overload the Tower&#x27;s systems, causing feedback that knocks Jericho out of Cyborg. After recovering, Cyborg pretends to still have Jericho inside of him, to draw out Vigilante, who was currently targeting Jericho. The plot works too well when Vigilante appears and shoots Cyborg in the head.

===2008 miniseries===
In an unspecified time during the &quot;Teen Titans&quot; comics, a man with enhancements similar to Cyborg&#x27;s attacks Dr. Sarah Charles on the day of her wedding to Deshaun, a young scientist. Cyborg rushes in for the save, discovering how Deshaun, connected to Project M, has sold the technology used to turn Stone into Cyborg to the military. He also finds that the enhanced man was Ron Evers, once Victor&#x27;s best friend now turned terrorist, who was seeking vengeance for the soldiers used as test subjects. After Cyborg manages to calm down his friend and discovers the truth: Mr. Orr, revealed as the mastermind behind Project M&#x27;s cyborg research, brings his Stone-derived best subjects: the current Equus, an armored form of the Wildebeest, and a cyberized man sporting enhancements even more powerful than Stone&#x27;s current ones called Cyborg 2.0.

Cyborg 2.0 turns out to be the Titans Tomorrow Cyborg 2.0, snatched from his proper timeline and cajoled by Orr into fighting his younger self for the possession of their shared technology and Orr&#x27;s permission to use it in the battlefield. Cyborg is soon forced to fight simultaneously against the Phantom Limbs, an elite force of soldiers crippled in the Middle East and restored by his tech, and the Cyborg Revenge Squad, a broader formation composed of the Fearsome Five, Magenta, Girder, the Thinker, and Cyborgirl. Although the Cyborg Revenge Squad soon gains the upper hand, with the help of his fellow Titans Cyborg is able to hold his own in combat, reverse engineer on the fly some of the future technology used by Cyborg 2.0, and enhance his own body enough to win against Mr. Orr. He later decides to get a new lease in life, forgiving Deshaun and Sarah Charles on their wedding day for abusing his technology, resuming dating Sarah Simms and having the Phantom Limbs fitted with new, non-military, prosthetics. It is however implied the Phantom Limbs, unwilling to see Stone&#x27;s offer as a sign of good will, are trying to get back their weaponized prosthetics and wait for a rematch.

===Blackest Night and JLA===
In &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, Cyborg joins with Starfire, Beast Boy, and several other heroes to form an emergency team to fight off the army of dead Titans who have been reanimated as Black Lanterns. He later joins in the final battle at Coast City.

Following the dissolution of the current JLA after &quot;Justice League: Cry for Justice&quot;, Cyborg is invited by Donna to join Kimiyo Hoshi&#x27;s new Justice League. He befriends Red Tornado, and claims that he has come up with a plan to make him indestructible.

After a battle with Doctor Impossible&#x27;s gang, Cyborg is forced to take a leave of absence from the team to not only help rebuild Red Tornado, but also help Roy Harper, who had his arm severed by Prometheus. During this time, Victor leads Superboy and Kid Flash to the city of Dakota to rescue the Teen Titans, who had been defeated and captured by Holocaust. The Titans emerge victorious from the battle after Kid Flash uses his powers to send Holocaust plummeting into the Earth&#x27;s core.

Despite apparently being written off the team, writer James Robinson explained that Cyborg would continue to have a presence on the JLA, and that he was given a co-feature in the back of the book for &quot;Justice League of America&quot; (vol. 2) #48–50. In the co-feature, Cyborg battles Red Tornado after he has been driven insane by the power of Alan Scott&#x27;s Starheart. In the midst of the battle, a flashback reveals that Victor had rebuilt Red Tornado using self-replicating nanites similar to the ones that Prometheus infected Roy with after cutting off his arm, thus making the android indestructible. Cyborg manages to free Red Tornado his power matrix.

Cyborg briefly appears in &quot;Justice League: Generation Lost&quot;, where he is shown helping Wonder Woman and Starfire search for Maxwell Lord after his resurrection.

Following an adventure in another dimension, Static is left powerless, and Miss Martian is rendered comatose. Cyborg stops the powerless Static from returning to Dakota, and instead tells him that he and a scientist named Rochelle Barnes will be taking him to Cadmus Labs to find a way to get his powers back and awaken Miss Martian. As Static packs up his belongings, Cyborg and Rochelle have a conversation which reveals that they are lying to Static, and have an ulterior motive for taking the two Titans to Cadmus.

He later appears in the final two issues of &quot;The Return of Bruce Wayne&quot;, where he helps his former teammate Red Robin in his attempt to stop Bruce Wayne from inadvertently unleashing an apocalyptic explosion of Omega Energy.

Cyborg and Red Tornado later travel to the Moon alongside Doctor Light, Animal Man, Congorilla, Zauriel, Tasmanian Devil and Bulleteer as part of an emergency group of heroes gathered to assist the Justice League in their battle against Eclipso. Shortly into the battle, Cyborg and the others are taken over by Eclipso and are turned against their JLA comrades. The reserve JLA members are all freed after Eclipso is defeated.

===The New 52===

As of August 2011, Cyborg is featured as one of the main characters in a new Justice League ongoing series written by Geoff Johns and drawn by Jim Lee as part of DC&#x27;s &quot;The New 52&quot; relaunch. Johns has said of Cyborg, &quot;He represents all of us in a lot of ways. If we have a cellphone and we&#x27;re texting on it, we are a cyborg—that&#x27;s what a cyborg is, using technology as an extension of ourselves.&quot;

In a revised origin, Victor Stone appears as a high school football star who is heavily sought after by scouts, but has a distant relationship with his father, Silas, a S.T.A.R. Labs Scientist. Victor appears at his father&#x27;s Lab as Silas&#x27; team is studying a Mother Box that Superman brought them. After a heated argument about Silas not attending Victor&#x27;s games even after hearing about his son&#x27;s success, the Mother Box explodes. The explosion kills the other scientists and destroys most of Victor&#x27;s body, but spares Silas. Silas does everything he can for Victor&#x27;s survival, along with Sarah Charles, and T. O. Morrow by using the technology kept in S.T.A.R&#x27;s &quot;Red Room&quot; safe. Ultimately Silas uses an injection of experimental nanites with Dr. Morrow adding robotic pieces onto Victor to assist. Victor recovers, now transformed into a Cyborg but as a side effect of the Mother Box&#x27;s energies introduced into his body and interacting with his cybernetic parts, he access the vast New Gods data library, where he discover Darkseid&#x27;s invasion plans and that it&#x27;s executed as he was being rebuilt. Victor is getting used to his new body when Parademons attack, attempting to grab Dr. Charles. Cyborg&#x27;s defense systems react, and he quickly dispatches the Parademons while also destroying part of the lab. Victor blames Silas for his condition after hearing his father out and leaves. Later on after attempting to help a few civilians under attack, Victor inadvertently absorbs some of the attacking Parademon&#x27;s components giving him access to Boom Tube technology. This ability automatically activates and transports him to where Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Green Lantern, and Aquaman are fighting against Darkseid&#x27;s force, just moments before Darkseid arrives. He fights alongside the other heroes against Darkseid and his army, but Darkseid proves to be too strong. Victor is able to reverse engineer the alien boom tube technology and teleport all the invading army including Darkseid away, saving the Earth and then helps found the Justice League.

Silas attempt to study his son more from a scientific perspective, but Victor refuses instead focusing on helping people as a superhero leading both to remain at odds. After David Graves makes an attack against the Justice League, Cyborg learns that he walks the line between life and death after he sees a false apparition of his human self. The appriation tries to convince him that the real Victor died and Cyborg is just his body being animated by the robotics to believe it&#x27;s still Victor. Victor is able to get past that ideal as just a ruse, though later leads him to question his humanity or lack thereof. Flash attempts to be there for Victor during his time of questioning. During the Throne of Atlantis storyline, Cyborg is offered an upgrade his father has that would allow him to operate underwater at the price of his remaining lung, which Victor rejects at first. However following the capture of the rest of the Justice League by Ocean Master, Cyborg reluctantly accepts the upgrade. This allows him and Mera to rescue the others.

During the &quot;Trinity War&quot; storyline, Cyborg gets a visual of Shazam heading to Kahndaq, to which Batman assembles the Justice League with the help from Zatanna to meet in Kahndaq to stop Shazam. Following the supposed death of Doctor Light in Kahndaq, Batman tells Superman that Cyborg and Martian Manhunter are doing an autopsy to prove his death was not Superman&#x27;s fault. As Wonder Woman leads the Justice League Dark to look for Pandora, Cyborg is among the superheroes who remain at A.R.G.U.S. while Batman, Flash, Aquaman, Shazam, Steve Trevor, Zatanna, and Phantom Stranger go to stop Wonder Woman. Cyborg was present when Atom tells him, Superman, Element Woman, and Firestorm the true purpose of the creation of the Justice League of America and that she was spying on the Justice League, which is how the Justice League of America ended up in Kahndaq. When the Crime Syndicate arrives on Prime Earth, Cyborg&#x27;s old prosthetic parts combine to form a robot called Grid (who is operated by a sentient computer virus). During the &quot;Forever Evil&quot; event, after Batman and Catwoman drop Cyborg off to his father in Detroit, he makes the choice to willingly receive a new cybernetic body and helps his father and Dr. Morrow create one that is slimmer in appearance so Cyborg could look more human. Working together with the Metal Men created by Doc Magus, Cyborg succeeds in shutting down Grid.
Afterward, Cyborg helped newcomer to the group Shazam fit in with the league as the rest set out to find Power Ring&#x27;s missing accessory which flew off after the death of the former wearer. While on monitor duty he and Shazam experiment with some of his magical powers to aid in finding the ring after joking about having an Xbox in his left shoulder; only for the young ward to conjure up a ping pong table, which they play while having spare time on their hands. Eventually the call goes out and everyone in the league mobilizes to secure the new rampaging Power Ring before the Doom Patrol does. After coaxing Billy into action against Jessica Cruz, Victor moves in to interface with the ring itself, finding out a great deal about the ring of Volthoom and his current host, only to be forcefully thrown out after the ring entity rejects him by causing his systems to short circuit, removing him from the battle. He is last seen recovering at S.T.A.R. Labs, after Shazam rushed him to the med bay, following the power ring crisis. Cyborg wondered what he saw within the ring after his dad warned him interfacing with it again could trap him in it forever.

An incident involving Batman&#x27;s son, Damian Wayne, during the &quot;Robin Rises Alpha &amp; Omega&quot; story arc in Batman, led up to most of the Justice League battling against Glorious Godfrey and a Parademon horde from Apokolips when they captured the chaos shard and the sarcophagus of Damian, before retreating back home. All the league members present, Cyborg included, state to an adamant Bruce Wayne that running headlong into unmarked X-factor territory for a suicide mission was less than ideal, considering the consequences that could befall the earth. This eventually culminates with Batman hijacking Cyborg&#x27;s teleportation systems, to zip up to the Watchtower in an attempt to retrieve an experimental and highly dangerous combat suit, to mete out his agenda. However, Cyborg manages to block his administrative access so that he, Shazam, Aquaman, Wonder Woman, Lex, and Cold could physically restrain him, causing Batman to begrudgingly give up and retire to the Batcave.

After the Bat left, the rest of the Bat-Family turned up asking Victor for help with some digitized doppelgangers of baddies that Bruce initially set up to distract the League, destabilize watchtower security to secure the Hellbat, and eventually use a personal Mother Box (secured from a Parademon kept in cold storage) to vacate to Apokolips. After making his way to the Batcave to meet with them, he&#x27;s directed over to a console which enabled him to directly access the Batcomputer&#x27;s systems. However, it was all a ruse utilizing a preemptive countermeasure devised by Batman tailored to Cyborg&#x27;s specific weaknesses. Cyborg was temporarily incapacitated and was set into a VR simulation where he relived his more peaceful days in college, while Batgirl went to work on his Mother Box to secure a path towards Apokolips and chase after their father. But Victor eventually snapped out of his dream haze and followed them through, angered that they used him in such away. Cyborg traveled along with Titus, who hitched a ride on his leg, to catch up with the rest of the Batman Family. They all then have a run-in with the scavengers of Armegeddo who quickly vacate after some Apokoliptian Hunger Dogs make their way onto the scene. They eventually catch up with the armor-clad Dark Knight ripping his way through a sizable chunk of Apokolips&#x27;s forces singlehandedly. Jason Tim and Barbara show Batman the Robin Medals Alfred gave them to remind him of his purpose, causing him to snap out of his berserker rage and note that Cyborg had reluctantly accompanied them to Hell itself. Having made their way into Darkseid&#x27;s citadel where Kalibak was readying his Chaos Cannon to fire again, the caped crusaders kept Darkseid&#x27;s forces occupied while Cyborg made short work of the massive war engine, tearing it in half. But when he went to set a timed self-destruct sequence within the Apokoliptian computers, Victor suffered catastrophic feedback that fried most of his internal systems leaving him inoperable just as Darkseid himself made his appearance.

While Batman fought and held Darkseid off, Cyborg ran Batgirl through a crash course on how to hotwire his own Mother Box. Since Darkseid smashed Batman&#x27;s Boom Tube generator, Cyborg was their only chance off Apokolips. After successfully jury-rigging his internal systems, Cyborg and the rest of the Bat rogues made a hasty exit stage left as Bruce powered his recovered fragment of the Chaos Shard with Darkseid&#x27;s Omega Effect, blasting Darkseid against a wall to cover their escape. In the aftermath, Cyborg, who is still unable to facilitate himself, wonders what is going on as Damian Wayne is successfully revived, however, a second anomaly cranks out of the Boom Tube that was opened and Kalibak comes charging through it. With Kalibak occupied by the rest of the gang, Victor tries his best to reestablish his downed systems. He is successful and gains control over the still-open tube as Batman readies the Batplane. As Batman rams his jet into the evil New God sending him careening back to Apokolips, Cyborg closes the portal banishing Darkseid&#x27;s firstborn for good. With the threat over, Cyborg heads back topside to inform the rest of the league of what all transpired and stating he has JL business to attend to.

An eponymous ongoing series, by writer David F. Walker and artist Ivan Reis, debuted in July 2015.

===DC Rebirth===
As of &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, he is a part of the relaunched Justice League bi-monthly series as well as his own solo monthly series. It is unclear whether he has the ability of flight in Rebirth.

During &quot;Dark Nights: Metal&quot;, he is captured by the alternate Batmen of the Dark Multiverse, who attempt to hack him to learn the secrets of his teammates. As the crisis escalates, Cyborg is confronted by the controlling consciousness of other Mother Boxes, who claim that he will only gain the power to overcome the Dark Batmen if he fully surrenders to the Mother Box that powers his body at the cost of the transformation deleting his old personality. He is nearly tempted to give in to this transformation, but the appearance of Raven&#x27;s soul-self convinces him to hold on to himself while partially succumbing to the transformation. This allows him to free his teammates and &#x27;hack&#x27; the multiverse as they travel to find new allies in the battle against the Dark Batmen.

===New Justice===
In the &quot;New Justice era&quot;, Cyborg remains a prominent member in Justice League&#x27;s fourth volume, as well as the four-issue &quot;Justice League: No Justice&quot; miniseries, and the succeeding 25-issue title &quot;Justice League Odyssey&quot;. The titles and story arcs of this era primarily revolve around Cyborg fighting alongside his usual teammates (and occasionally several villains) to survive uncovered secrets of the Multiverse and the Source Wall.

In the succeeding &quot;Justice League Odyssey&quot; title, Cyborg joins forces with Starfire, Jessica Cruz, and Azrael to explore previously unaffected areas of outer space. The team finds themselves being led into the newly-established &quot;Ghost Sector&quot; by Darkseid, who seeks to use the power of the Old Gods to conquer the Multiverse.

In addition, Cyborg&#x27;s own solo monthly series was concluded in June 2018 with the release of Issue 23.

=== Infinite Frontier ===
As of Infinite Frontier, Cyborg is a part of Titans Academy. In this monthly title, the Titans are now mentors to the newest generation of heroes.

=== Dawn of DC (2023–present) ===
In the Dawn Of DC, Cyborg is now given a new 6 issue mini-series, written by Morgan Hampton and drawn by Tom Raney. He is also part of the Titans who have replaced the Justice League following their death and return in &quot;Dark Crisis&quot;. After returning to Detroit, Victor soon finds himself at odds with an aggressive artificial intelligence attempting to transform the city.

==Powers and abilities==
Large portions of Victor Stone&#x27;s body have been replaced by advanced mechanical parts (hence the name Cyborg) granting him superhuman strength, speed, stamina, and flight. His mechanically-enhanced body, much of which is metallic (initially Promethium mainly &quot;depleted&quot; Promethium made of titanium and vanadium), is far more durable than a normal human body. Cyborg&#x27;s internal computer system can interface with external computers. Other features include an electronic &quot;eye&quot; which replicates vision but at a superhuman level. His mechanical parts contain a wide variety of tools and weapons, such as a grappling hook/line and a finger-mounted laser. Perhaps his most frequently-used weapon is his sound amplifier (often referred to as his &quot;white sound blaster&quot; in the comic books; the &quot;Teen Titans&quot; animated series calls it a &quot;sonic cannon&quot;) which can be employed at various settings either to stun his foes or to deliver concentrated blasts of sound potent enough to shatter rock and deform steel.

Cyborg is consistently depicted as making adjustments to his cybernetic parts, enhancing his functions and abilities to levels beyond those set by his father. This change has allowed writers to adjust his powers as needed for various stories. Following DC&#x27;s New 52 reboot in 2011, Cyborg&#x27;s origin story was changed so that his enhancements were the product of alien technology, specifically that of a Mother Box from the planet New Genesis. His cybernetics are now seen as a living extension of his body, and a host of new skills such as EMP blasts, technology absorption, and underwater adaptation were added to his powerset. Most significantly, he was given the ability to generate boom tubes — powerful teleportation tunnels used by the New Gods to travel vast distances — due to this Mother Box connection. Elements of Victor&#x27;s original backstory were re-established following DC&#x27;s Trinity War storyline when his father rebuilds systems following extensive damage to them.

In addition to his mechanical enhancements, Stone possesses an &quot;exceptionally gifted&quot; level of intelligence; his IQ has been measured at 170.

====DC Extended Universe====

Cyborg appears in films set in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), portrayed by Ray Fisher. When interviewed by &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; after the release of &quot;Zack Snyder&#x27;s Justice League&quot;, screenwriter Chris Terrio stated that he had worked extensively with Fisher on the development of the character. Terrio said that both men understood the &quot;responsibility&quot; of developing the first black superhero to appear in a DC film. While other black superheroes, such as Sam Wilson in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, appeared in film before &quot;Justice League&quot;, Cyborg was to be the first cast in a starring role for a big-budget film prior to the release of the MCU film &quot;Black Panther&quot;. Terrio was upset with the removal of much of his work on the theatrical cut, including Cyborg&#x27;s backstory, and considered having his name taken off the film before realizing it would cause more problems for the film&#x27;s already troubled production.
* Cyborg first appears in a cameo depicted in &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; (2016).
* Cyborg appears in &quot;Justice League&quot; (2017) and the director&#x27;s cut, &quot;Zack Snyder&#x27;s Justice League&quot; (2021). In both films, the effects for his cybernetic parts were achieved using CGI.
* A stand-alone &quot;Cyborg&quot; film was originally scheduled for a release date of April 3, 2020, but has since been canceled.
* James Gunn, showrunner of the HBO Max series &quot;Peacemaker&quot; and later co-head of DC Studios, originally planned for the DCEU incarnations of Cyborg and Batman to appear with the Justice League in the show&#x27;s season one finale, albeit portrayed by stand-ins. However, Warner Bros. had him remove the pair from the episode due to &quot;upcoming DCEU projects&quot;.
*While he was originally slated to appear as Cyborg in the film &quot;The Flash&quot; with a major role, Fisher stated in January 2021 that he and his character had been removed from the film due to the involvement of DC Films head Walter Hamada, as Fisher&#x27;s feud with &quot;Justice League&quot; replacement director Joss Whedon also grew to include Hamada for allegedly protecting the former.

<text>Alberta Charlayne Hunter-Gault (born February 27, 1942) is an American civil rights activist, journalist and former foreign correspondent for National Public Radio, CNN, and the Public Broadcasting Service. Charlayne Hunter and Hamilton Holmes were the first African-American students to attend the University of Georgia.

==Early life==
Alberta Charlayne Hunter was born in Due West, South Carolina, daughter of Col. Charles Shepherd Henry Hunter, Jr., U.S. Army, a regimental chaplain, and his wife, the former Althea Ruth Brown. She became interested in journalism at the age of 12 after reading the comic strip &quot;Brenda Starr, Reporter&quot;.

In 1955, one year after the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; ruling, Hunter was in eighth grade and was the only black student at an Army school in Alaska, where her father was stationed. Her parents divorced after spending the year in Alaska, and Hunter moved to Atlanta with her mother, two brothers, and maternal grandmother.  

After moving to Atlanta, she attended Henry McNeal Turner High School where she became editor-in-chief of &quot;The Green Light&quot;, the school&#x27;s newspaper, assistant yearbook editor, and &quot;Miss Turner High&quot;.

In 1958, members of the Atlanta Committee for Cooperative Action (ACCA) began to search for high-achieving African-American seniors who attended high schools in Atlanta. They were interested in jump-starting the integration of white universities in Georgia. They were searching for the best students so that universities would have no reason to reject them other than race. Hunter, along with Hamilton Holmes were the two students selected by the committee to integrate Georgia State College (later Georgia State University) in Atlanta. However, Hunter and Holmes were more interested in attending the University of Georgia. 

The two were initially rejected by the university on the grounds that there was no more room in the dorms for incoming freshmen who were required to live there. That fall, Hunter enrolled at Wayne University (later Wayne State University) where she received assistance from the Georgia tuition program on the basis that there were no black universities in the state who offered a journalism program.

Despite meeting the qualifications to transfer to the University of Georgia, she and Holmes were rejected every quarter due to the fact that there was no room for them in the dorms, but transfer students in similar situations were admitted. This led to court case &quot;Holmes v. Danner&quot;, in which the registrar of the university, Walter Danner, was the defendant. After winning the case, Holmes and Hunter became the first two African-American students to enroll in the University of Georgia on January 9, 1961.

Hunter graduated in 1963 with a B.A. in journalism.

==Career==

In 1967, Hunter joined the investigative news team at WRC-TV, Washington, D.C., and anchored the local evening news. In 1968, Hunter-Gault joined &quot;The New York Times&quot; as a metropolitan reporter specializing in coverage of the urban black community. She joined &quot;The MacNeil/Lehrer Report&quot; in 1978 as a correspondent, becoming &quot;The NewsHour&quot;&#x27;s national correspondent in 1983. She left &quot;The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer&quot; in June 1997. She worked in Johannesburg, South Africa, as National Public Radio&#x27;s chief correspondent in Africa (1997–99). Hunter-Gault then joined CNN as its Johannesburg bureau chief and correspondent in 1999. She exited this role in 2005, although she still regularly appeared on the network and others, as an Africa specialist.

During her association with &quot;The NewsHour&quot;, Hunter-Gault won additional awards: two Emmys and a Peabody for excellence in broadcast journalism for her work on &quot;Apartheid&#x27;s People&quot;, a &quot;NewsHour&quot; series on South Africa. She also received the 1986 Journalist of the Year Award from the National Association of Black Journalists, a Candace Award for Journalism from the National Coalition of 100 Black Women in 1988, the 1990 Sidney Hillman Award, the &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; Broadcast Personality of the Year Award, the Women in Radio and Television Award and two awards from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for excellence in local programming. The University of Georgia Academic Building is named for her, along with Hamilton Holmes, as it is called the Holmes/Hunter Academic Building, as of 2001. She has been a member of the Peabody Awards Board of Jurors since 2009 and serves on the Board of Trustees at the Carter Center.

Hunter-Gault is author of &quot;In My Place&quot; (1992), a memoir about her experiences at the University of Georgia.

==Personal life==
While in high school, at the age of 16, Hunter, along with two friends, converted to Catholicism after being raised as a follower of the African Methodist Episcopal Church.

Shortly before she was graduated from the University of Georgia, Hunter married a classmate, Walter L. Stovall, the writer son of a chicken-feed manufacturer. The couple was first married in March 1963 and then remarried in Detroit, Michigan, on June 8, 1963, because they believed that, since he was white, the first ceremony might be considered invalid as well as criminal, based on laws about interracial marriages in the unidentified state in which they had been married. Once the marriage was revealed, the governor of Georgia called it &quot;a shame and a disgrace&quot;, while Georgia&#x27;s attorney general made public statements about prosecuting the mixed-race couple under Georgia law. News reports quoted the parents of both bride and groom as being against the marriage for reasons of race. Years later, after the couple&#x27;s 1972 divorce, Hunter-Gault gave a speech at the university in which she praised Stovall, who, she said, &quot;unhesitatingly jumped into my boat with me. He gave up going to movies because he knew I couldn&#x27;t get a seat in the segregated theaters. He gave up going to the Varsity because he knew they would not serve me... We married, despite the uproar we knew it would cause, because we loved each other.&quot; Shortly after their marriage, Stovall was quoted as saying, &quot;We are two young people who found ourselves in love and did what we feel is required of people when they are in love and want to spend the rest of their lives together. We got married.&quot; The couple had one daughter, Suesan Stovall, a singer (born December 1963).

Following her divorce from Walter Stovall, Hunter married Ronald T. Gault, a black businessman who was then a program officer for the Ford Foundation. Later, he became an investment banker and consultant. They have one son, Chuma Gault, an actor (born 1972). The couple lived in Johannesburg, South Africa, where they also produced wine for a label called Passages. After moving back to the United States, the couple maintain a home in Massachusetts, where they remain active supporters of the arts.

<doc id="676529" wikidata="Q973759" url="?curid=676529" title="Thailand Masters">
<text>The Thailand Masters was a professional snooker tournament. Previously known as Asian Open and Thailand Open, it was a ranking tournament from 1989/90 to 2001/02. An event called the &quot;Thailand Masters&quot; also formed part of the &quot;World Series&quot; in 1991/92, with Steve Davis beating Stephen Hendry 6–3. The final champion was Marco Fu.

==History==
The Thailand Masters was first held in the 1983/1984 season. It was organised by Matchroom Sport as part of their World Series and sponsored by Camus, but was abandoned after 1986/1987. The event returned to the calendar in 1989 under the Asian Open name and it became a ranking tournament. In its first three years under this name the event was sponsored by 555 and then by Nescafé in 1993. All events took place in Bangkok, Thailand, except in 1990, which was held in China. In the 1991/1992 season two events were held. The Thailand Masters was part of the World Series and the Asian Open was a ranking event. In 1993 Dave Harold became the lowest ranked player to win a ranking tournament. He was ranked world number 93, when he beat Darren Morgan 9–3.

The event changed its name to Thailand Open in 1993/1994. The event was held in Bangkok and remained there until the 2002/2003 season. It was sponsored by Kloster, before Singha took over for 1995/1996. The event was renamed to the Thailand Masters in the 1997/1998 season and was sponsored by Beer Chang. The only official maximum break in the history of the competition came at the qualifying stages of the 1999 event. Adrian Gunnell compiled it in the first round against Mario Wehrmann. The event didn&#x27;t have a sponsor again until the 2000/2001 season, when it was sponsored by Blue Eagle and Thai Airways and was sponsored by Singha in 2001/2002. The event lost its ranking status in 2002/2003, after World Snooker decided not to afford a Far East event. The event returned as a domestic event with several players from the Main Tour still competing. The event was last held in the 2006/2007 season with the sponsorship of Sangsom, but was discontinued after that.

<text>Byåsen is a large neighborhood area in the city of Trondheim in Trøndelag county, Norway. It constitutes a large part of the city in the borough of Midtbyen in Trondheim Municipality. It encompasses a number of areas southwest of the main city centre. This includes all areas on the west side of the river Nidelva and north of Granåsen. This is mainly a residential area, with 32,136 residents as of 1 January 2003. Gråkallbanen tram line connects Byåsen to the city centre along with a number of bus routes (8, 5, and 19) as well as night time services by bus and tram in the weekends.

The name Byåsen can be translated into &quot;city hill&quot;, which describes its elevated position, overlooking the rest of Trondheim. The view of Trondheim can be seen from Utsikten (meaning &quot;the view&quot;) around which the wealthier residents of Byåsen live. House prices in the area are considerably higher than other parts of the city. Byåsen is the only larger district in Trondheim that has a solid rock underground.

As a consequence of its position above the rest of the city (from above sea level) there is more snow on Byåsen during the winter than in lower parts of Trondheim. Bymarka, located on the southern and western part of Byåsen, is a large recreational area with forest and lakes, which is very popular for cross country skiing in the winter season. The weather conditions and the extensive network of cross country tracks in this area helped Granåsen, an outdoor winter sporting arena situated at the south end of Bymarka, in hosting the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in 1997. Trondheim Golfklubb golf course is also based on Byåsen, although these same weather conditions complicate matters and shortens the season. There is also an 18-hole golf course located at Byneset in the western lowland area of Trondheim.

At the end of the last ice age, between 10,000 and 11,500 years ago, the sea level was about higher than it is today. The old sea level is still visible in the landscape forming a line along the hill which can be seen from the city. This line is called the Strandline (&quot;Strandlinje&quot;) and is most easily spotted from Kristiansten Fortress which is located to the east of the city centre. A path following Strandlinje is today popular with visitors to the city forest area of Bymarka which covers the most elevated parts of Byåsen.

==Hallset==
Hallset is a part of the area of Byåsen. It has several apartment blocks and is a suburban area. Hallset consists of Hallset School (&quot;Hallset Skole&quot;), a grammar school for children aged 6–12 years, and Selsbakk School (&quot;Selsbakk Skole&quot;), a junior high for children aged 13–16 years old. It also has a church historically called Hallset Church (&quot;Hallset Kirke&quot;) but now known as Byåsen Church (&quot;Byåsen kirke&quot;).

<doc id="676540" wikidata="Q1340376" url="?curid=676540" title="Valuair">
<text>Valuair (Chinese: 惠旅航空) was a Singapore-based low-cost carrier. It was launched on 5 May 2004, initially offering services to Bangkok and Hong Kong, before expanding to Indonesia, Mainland China and other cities in Thailand. It differentiated itself from other low-cost carriers by offering frills such as a baggage allowance of 20 kg, in-flight food, and a large seat pitch. Acquired on 24 July 2005 by Jetstar Asia, an Australian airline, the Valuair brand was retained for Jetstar Asia&#x27;s scheduled services to major cities in Indonesia until 26 October 2014.

The Southwest Finger of Level 3 of Terminal 1 at Changi Airport housed the head office of the airline.

== History ==
Valuair was the first low-cost airline to begin operations in Singapore, although some do not consider it as such by other definitions. Launching its first flight on 5 May 2004, it was funded by local businessmen, and had the expertise of an ex-Singapore Airlines employee as its chief executive.

Valuair sought to differentiate itself from its competitors such as then-rival Jetstar Asia and Tiger Airways by offering free hot meals, wider legroom and assigned seating, and marketed itself as a low-fare airline. The airline flew beyond the traditional five-hour radius typical of low-cost carriers and flew to destinations like Perth, Xiamen and Chengdu. The airline even had ambitious plans flying to Australia&#x27;s East Coast and Northeast Asia using wide-body aircraft. In its plans, a Business Class and cargo operations was even thought of. However, rising fuel prices, along with lack of financial backing and the deep pockets of Qantas&#x27; Jetstar Asia and Singapore Airlines-backed Tiger Airways finally forced the airline to concede defeat in the highly-competitive local scene.

On 24 July 2005, the carrier announced plans to merge with Jetstar Asia. Both Jetstar Asia, a Qantas-backed airline, and Valuair were planning to operate their respective routes normally for the foreseeable future. The announcement came after several weeks of speculation about consolidation within Southeast Asia&#x27;s low-cost airline industry.

=== Valuair and Jetstar Asia merger ===
On 24 July 2005, Jetstar Asia and Valuair merged to form Orange Star, in the first major consolidation of Southeast Asia&#x27;s crowded low-cost airline industry. Jetstar Asia and Valuair said they would continue to operate their normal routes under their own brands in the meantime, with little or no change to the service offered by either airline. Qantas chief executive officer and Jetstar Asia chairman Geoff Dixon chaired the new company. Jetstar Asia chief executive officer Chong Phit Lian was appointed as the chief executive of both airlines. The new company was to receive a cash injection of more than S$50 million in fresh capital into the new entity, largely to be provided by Qantas. Shareholders of Valuair, including airline industry veteran Lim Chin Beng, Malaysia&#x27;s Star Cruises and Asiatravel.com, have now become minority shareholders in the merged company.

From 11 September 2005, Valuair began flying twice daily from Singapore to Jakarta. The new daily flight began as VF208 from Singapore to Jakarta, and VF207 from Jakarta to Singapore. As of 1 February 2008, flights to Jakarta increased to four times daily. From 23 October 2005, Valuair commenced daily flights from Singapore to Surabaya, VF531 operated from Singapore to Surabaya, and VF532 vice versa. Flights to Hong Kong were suspended.

From 26 January 2006, Valuair commenced three weekly flights from Singapore to Denpasar Bali. As at 1 February 2008, the service has been upgraded to become four times per week.

=== Post-merger ===
Until 2014, the airline flew exclusively to Indonesian destinations - namely Jakarta, Medan, Surabaya and Denpasar. In an attempt to protect local airlines, in 2005 Indonesia introduced a new policy preventing foreign low-cost carriers from flying to major airports within the country. Jetstar Asia had not yet established routes into Indonesia, so the merger was seen as the airline&#x27;s strategy to get an early entrance into the lucrative Indonesian market.

Valuair flights are operated by Jetstar Asia crew, with the in-flight menu and entertainment virtually the same as Jetstar Asia&#x27;s. Some Jetstar flights are flown using Valuair aircraft.

In February 2008, Jetstar Asia announced that it would begin flights to Medan later in the year. As existing protectionism policies are in place, the flights were operated under Valuair&#x27;s code.

Jetstar Asia is a majority Singapore-owned and -based company. The company is managed by Newstar Holdings Pty Ltd, majority owned by Singapore company Westbrook Investments Pte Ltd (51 per cent), with the Qantas Group holding the remaining 49 per cent of shares.

In October 2014, after the Indonesian Government lifting operational restrictions on foreign-owned low-cost carriers into Indonesia, Valuair was dissolved and its flights were taken over by Jetstar Asia on 26 October 2014.

== Destinations ==
Valuair offered flights between its base in Singapore to Jakarta, Denpasar and Surabaya, with Bangkok as a codeshare with Jetstar Asia. After the merger with Jetstar Asia, the airline cut routes to Perth, Hong Kong, Xiamen, Chengdu and Bangkok, as part of a consolidation exercise between both airlines. The last flight under the Valuair brand landed on 25 October 2014, and all flights thereafter were operated under the Jetstar Asia brand.

The following list shows the former destinations, including the city served, the country, the airport, and the begin and end year of the service.

== In-flight services ==
Passengers would purchase food and beverage on board from the cabin crew as part of a buy on board programme. On flights operated by Valuair, passengers were only allowed to consume food and drinks purchased onboard unless they had special dietary needs. Prior to merger, meal and drinks were included in the ticket charge.

<doc id="676553" wikidata="Q657390" url="?curid=676553" title="Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church">
<text>The Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church, also known in the United States as the Byzantine Catholic Church, is a &quot;sui iuris&quot; (autonomous) Eastern Catholic particular church based in Eastern Europe and North America that is part of the worldwide Catholic Church and is in full communion with the Holy See. It uses the Byzantine Rite for its liturgies, laws, and cultural identity.

The modern Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church originated at the Union of Uzhhorod in 1646, when Orthodox East Slavs with a Rusyn identity in the Carpathian Mountains entered into communion with the Pope. Its largest jurisdiction became the Greek Catholic Eparchy of Mukachevo, which reemerged in Ukraine after having been suppressed during the Soviet Union. There is also the Apostolic Exarchate of the Greek Catholic Church in the Czech Republic, founded in 1996. Both of them are exempt territories immediately subject to the Holy See. The Metropolis of Pittsburgh is the Church&#x27;s self-governing jurisdiction in the United States, created in the early 20th century for Rusyn immigrants. Today it includes many members of non-Eastern European descent while still continuing Ruthenian traditions. In 1956 the U.S. jurisdiction stopped using Ruthenian Greek Catholic to describe itself, and since 1969 it has called itself the Byzantine Catholic Church. In 2022 the Slovak Greek Catholic eparchy for Canada was changed to an exarchate and subordinated to the Byzantine Catholic Metropolis of Pittsburgh. 

==Name==
While not directly associated with the former Ruthenian Uniate Church, the Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church also derives its name from the Rusyn and Ruthenian Slavic peoples of Eastern Europe and their communion with Rome. Ruthenia was originally the Latin term for the Rus&#x27; people, from which the name Russia was also derived, but later on, especially after the Schism of 1054 led to the separation of the East Slavs from Rome with Eastern Orthodoxy, its definition was narrowed. It was used for the Orthodox Slavs in the eastern Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth that entered communion with the Pope at the Union of Brest in 1595 while continuing to use the Byzantine (or Greek) Rite. This was the basis for what later became the Ukrainian and Belarusian Greek Catholic Churches. In 1646, further to the south in Hungary, the Slavs in the Eastern Carpathians with a Rusyn identity who entered communion with Rome at the Union of Uzhhorod were also called Ruthenians. This created the Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church. In the 19th century, the term Ruthenian Greek Catholic referred to the Carpatho-Rusyns from Austria-Hungary, though their membership also included smaller numbers of Hungarians, Slovaks, and others. Today that region is spread across parts of Ukraine, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania.

While Ruthenian Catholics are not the only Eastern Catholics to utilize the Byzantine Rite in the United States, the Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church refers to itself as the &quot;Byzantine Catholic Church&quot; for its U.S. jurisdiction. Its full official name is the Byzantine Catholic Metropolitan Church of Pittsburgh.

==History==
The Ruthenian Church originally developed among the Rusyn people who lived in Carpathian Ruthenia. Christianity and the Byzantine Rite was brought to the Slavic peoples in the 9th century as a result of the missionary outreach of Saints Cyril and Methodius.

Following the Great Schism of 1054, the Ruthenian Church retained its Orthodox ties until the Union of Uzhhorod.

===Union of Uzhhorod===
The present structure of the Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church traces its origins to the 1646 Union of Uzhhorod, when Eastern Orthodox clergy were received into communion with the Holy See of Rome. Sixty three Ruthenian clergy were received into the Catholic Church; in 1664 a union reached at Munkács (today Mukachevo, Ukraine) brought additional communities into the Catholic communion.

Initially, the Union only included lands owned or administered by the noble Drugeth family; essentially, most of the modern-day Presov Region and part of Zakarpattia Oblast: Abov County, Gömör County, Sáros County, Szepes County, Torna County, northern Zemplén County, parts of Ung County, and the city of Uzhhorod itself.

The resulting dioceses retained their Byzantine patrimony and liturgical traditions, and their bishops were elected by a council composed of Basilian monks and eparchial clergy. In this part of central and eastern Europe, the Carpathian Mountains straddle the borders of the present-day states of Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Romania and Ukraine. Today, the church is multi-ethnic. Members of the metropolitan province of Pittsburgh are predominantly English-speaking. Most are descendants of Rusyns – including sub-groups like the Boikos, Hutsuls and Lemkos – but the descendants of other nationalities are also present such as Slovaks, Hungarians and Croats as well as those of non-Slavic and non-Eastern European ancestry. The modern Eparchy of Mukacheve in Ukraine is mostly Ukrainian-speaking but remains part of the greater Ruthenian Church.

After almost a thousand years of Hungarian rule the region became, in part, incorporated in Czechoslovakia after World War I. Annexation to the Soviet Union after the war led to persecution of the Ruthenian Catholic Church. Since the collapse of Communism the Ruthenian Catholic Church in Eastern Europe has seen a resurgence in numbers of faithful and priests.

===United States===

In the 19th and 20th centuries, various Byzantine Catholics from Austria-Hungary arrived in the United States, particularly in coal mining towns. Members of the predominant Latin Church Catholic hierarchy were sometimes disturbed by what they saw as the innovation, for the United States, of a married Catholic clergy. At their persistent request, the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith applied, on 1 May 1897, to the United States rules already set out in a letter of 2 May 1890, to François-Marie-Benjamin Richard, the Latin Archbishop of Paris. These rules stated that only celibates and widowed priests coming without their children should be permitted in the United States.

The dissatisfaction of many Ruthenian Catholics had already given rise to some groups placing themselves under the jurisdiction of what is today the Orthodox Church in America (at that time a mission of the Russian Orthodox Church). The leader of this movement was the widowed Ruthenian Catholic priest Alexis Toth, whose mistreatment by Archbishop John Ireland of Saint Paul, Minnesota, led to Toth&#x27;s transfer to Eastern Orthodoxy. He brought with him many Ruthenian Catholics, around 20,000 by the time of his death with many who followed afterward, and was canonized a saint by the Orthodox Church in America in 1996.

The situation with Alexis Toth and the Latin Catholic bishops highlighted the need for American Eastern Catholics to have their own bishop. Pope Pius X appointed the Ukrainian bishop Soter Ortynsky in 1907 as bishop for all Slavic Eastern Catholics of the Byzantine rite in America. For this period the Ruthenian Byzantine Catholics were united to the Ukrainian Greek Catholics in the same eparchy. Ethnic tensions flared due to cultural differences (mostly of a political nature) between Ukrainians who came from Austrian-ruled Galicia and the Rusyns and other Byzantine Catholics who came from the Kingdom of Hungary.

This caused Rome to split the groups after Ortynsky&#x27;s death, creating two ecclesiastical administrations for Eastern-rite Catholics in the United States, divided along nationality lines: one Ukrainian and the other Carpatho-Rusyn. Each was headed not by a bishop, but by an administrator: Father Peter Poniatyshyn for the Ukrainians and Father Gabriel Martyak for the Carpatho-Rusyns. Later, the Rusyn priest Basil Takach was appointed and consecrated in Rome on his way to America as the new eparchy&#x27;s bishop. Bishop Takach is considered the first bishop of Ruthenian Catholics in America, and his appointment as the official founding of the Byzantine Catholic Metropolitan Church of Pittsburgh.

Clerical celibacy of American Eastern Catholics was restated with special reference to the Byzantine/Ruthenian Church by 1 March 1929, decree &quot;Cum data fuerit&quot;, which was renewed for a further 10 years in 1939. Due to this and other similar factors, 37 Ruthenian parishes transferred themselves into the jurisdiction of the Greek Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch in 1938, creating the American Carpatho-Russian Orthodox Diocese.

Relations with the Latin Church Catholic hierarchy have improved, especially since the Second Vatican Council, at which the Ruthenian Church influenced decisions regarding using the vernacular (i.e. the language of the people) in the liturgy. In its decree &quot;Orientalium Ecclesiarum&quot;, the Second Vatican Council declared:The Catholic Church holds in high esteem the institutions, liturgical rites, ecclesiastical traditions and the established standards of the Christian life of the Eastern Churches, for in them, distinguished as they are for their venerable antiquity, there remains conspicuous the tradition that has been handed down from the Apostles through the Fathers and that forms part of the divinely revealed and undivided heritage of the universal Church.

The Second Vatican Council urged the Eastern Rite Churches to eliminate liturgical Latinization and to strengthen their Eastern Christian identity. In June 1999 the Council of Hierarchs of the Byzantine Metropolitan Church Sui Iuris of Pittsburgh USA promulgated the norms of particular law to govern itself. In January 2007, the Revised Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom and the Revised Divine Liturgy of St. Basil the Great were promulgated. In December 2013, the Pope approved the request of the Congregation for the Eastern Churches that appropriate Eastern Church authorities be granted the faculty to allow pastoral service of Eastern married clergy also outside the traditional Eastern territory.

Membership within the Ruthenian Catholic Church, like the other &quot;sui iuris&quot; churches, is not limited to those who trace their heritage to the ethnic groups affiliated with the church.

==Structure==
, the membership of the Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church was estimated at some 419,500 faithful, with seven bishops, 664 parishes, 557 priests, 76 deacons, and 192 men and women religious. The Church is not organised as a single synod. This is mainly because some of the priests and faithful of the Eparchy of Mukacheve desire that it should be part of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.

<doc id="676555" wikidata="Q744620" url="?curid=676555" title="Grand tourer">
<text>A grand tourer (GT) is a type of car that is designed for high speed and long-distance driving with performance and luxury. The most common format is a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive two-door coupé with either a two-seat or a 2+2 arrangement. Grand tourers are often the coupé derivative of luxury saloons or sedans. Some models, such as the Ferrari 250 GT, Jaguar E-Type, and Aston Martin DB5, are considered classic examples of &quot;gran turismo&quot; cars.

The term is a near-calque from the Italian language phrase &quot;gran turismo&quot;, which became popular in the English language in the 1950s, evolving from fast touring cars and streamlined closed sports cars during the 1930s.

==Origin in Europe==
The grand touring car concept originated in Europe in the early 1950s, especially with the 1951 introduction of the Lancia Aurelia B20 GT, and features notable luminaries of Italian automotive history such as Vittorio Jano, Enzo Ferrari and Johnny Lurani. Motorsports became important in the evolution of the grand touring concept, and grand touring entries are important in endurance sports-car racing. The grand touring definition implies material differences in performance, speed, comfort, and amenities between elite cars and those of ordinary motorists.

In the post-war United States, manufacturers were less inclined to adopt the &quot;ethos of the GT car&quot;, preferring to build cars &quot;suited to their long, straight, smooth roads and labor-saving lifestyles&quot; with wide availability of powerful straight-six and V8 engines in all price-ranges like the 1955–1965 Chrysler 300. Despite this, the United States, enjoying early post-war economic expansion, became the largest market for European grand-touring cars, supplying transportation for movie stars, celebrities and the jet set; notably the Mercedes-Benz 300 SL (imported by Max Hoffman), the Jaguar XK120, and the Ferrari &quot;berlinettas&quot; (imported by Luigi Chinetti). Classic grand-touring cars from the post-war era especially, have since become valuable cars among wealthy collectors. Within ten years, grand touring cars found success penetrating the new American personal luxury car market.

==Characteristics==
The terms &quot;grand tourer&quot;, &quot;gran turismo&quot;, &quot;grande routière&quot;, and &quot;GT&quot; are among the most misused terms in motoring. The grand touring designation generally &quot;means motoring at speed, in style, safety, and comfort&quot;. &quot;Purists define &quot;gran turismo&quot; as the enjoyment, excitement and comfort of open-road touring.&quot;

According to Sam Dawson, news editor of &quot;Classic Cars&quot;, &quot;the ideal is of a car with the ability to cross a continent at speed and in comfort yet provide driving thrills when demanded&quot; and it should exhibit the following:
* The engines &quot;should be able to cope with cruising comfortably at the upper limits on all continental roads without drawbacks or loss of usable power&quot;.
* &quot;Ideally, the GT car should have been devised by its progenitors as a Grand Tourer, with all associated considerations in mind.&quot;
* &quot;It should be able to transport at least two comfortably with their luggage and have room to spare — probably in the form of a two plus two seating arrangement.&quot;
* The design, both &quot;inside and out, should be geared toward complete control by the driver&quot;.
* Its &quot;chassis and suspension provide suitable handling and roadholding on all routes&quot; during travels.
Grand tourers emphasize comfort and handling over straight-out high performance or ascetic, spartan accommodations. In comparison, sports cars (also a &quot;much abused and confused term&quot;) are typically more &quot;crude&quot; compared to &quot;sophisticated Grand Touring machinery&quot;. However, the popularity of using GT for marketing purposes has meant that it has become a &quot;much misused term, eventually signifying no more than a slightly tuned version of a family car with trendy wheels and a go-faster stripe on the side&quot;.

Historically, most GTs have been front-engined with rear-wheel drive, offering more cabin space than mid-mounted engine layouts. Softer suspensions, greater storage, and more luxurious appointments add to their appeal.

==&quot;GT&quot; abbreviation in marketing==
The &quot;GT&quot; abbreviation—and variations thereof—are often used as model names. However, some cars with GT in the model name are not actually grand touring cars.

Among the many variations of GT are:
* GTA: &quot;Gran turismo alleggerita&quot; - the Italian word for &#x27;lightweight&#x27;. &quot;GTAm&quot; indicates a modified version. GTA is also sometimes used for automatic transmission models.
* GTB: &quot;Gran turismo berlinetta&quot;
* GTC: Various uses including &quot;gran turismo compressore&quot; for supercharged engines, &quot;gran turismo cabriolet&quot;, &quot;gran turismo&quot; compact, &quot;gran turismo&quot; crossover and &quot;gran turismo corsa&quot; - the Italian word for &#x27;racing&#x27;.
* GTD: &quot;&quot;Gran turismo&quot; diesel&quot;
* GT/E: &quot;Gran turismo Einspritzung&quot; - the German word for &#x27;fuel injection&#x27;
* GTE: &quot;Grand touring estate&quot;
* GTi or GTI: &quot;Grand touring injection&quot;, mostly used for hot hatches following the introduction of the Volkswagen Golf GTi
* GTO: &quot;&quot;Gran turismo omologato&quot; - the Italian word for &#x27;homologation&#x27;
* GTR or GT-R: &quot;Gran turismo&quot; and racing&quot;
* GTS: sometimes &quot;&quot;Gran turismo&quot; spider&quot; for convertible models. However, GTS has also been used for saloons and other body styles.
* GT-T: &quot;&quot;Gran turismo&quot; turbo&quot;
* GTV: &quot;Gran turismo veloce&quot; - the Italian word for &#x27;fast&#x27;
* GTX: &quot;Grand &quot;tourisme&quot; extreme&quot;
* HGT: &quot;High &quot;gran turismo&quot;&quot;

== World Championships and other GT racing series ==
===Current World Championship===
*FIA World Endurance Championship – In operation since 2012, the current auto racing World Championship for both Sports prototypes and GT cars organised by the Automobile Club de l&#x27;Ouest (ACO) and sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA). The championship is considered a revival of the defunct World Sportscar Championship which ended in 1992. In 2012-2016 seasons the &quot;World Cup for GT Manufacturer&quot; was awarded to a winning manufacturer of GT cars, promoted to the &quot;World GT Manufacturers&#x27; Championship&quot; title since the 2017 season. This title awarded to a winning manufacturer of GT cars was discontinued after the 2022 season.

===Former World Championships===
*World Sportscar Championship – The first sports car racing world series run from 1953 to 1992. Originally contested only by Sports prototypes, the series expanded to GT cars in the 1954 season at the 1954 Mille Miglia, but from the 1985 season until its end it was again restricted to Sports prototypes only. In 1962-1984 seasons (except of the 1982 season) titles were awarded to manufacturers of GT cars alongside the manufacturers of Sports prototypes.
*FIA GT1 World Championship – A short-lived series for GT cars run from 2010 to 2012, created by Stéphane Ratel Organisation (SRO) in an attempt to promote the FIA GT Championship to World Championship status.

===Other GT racing series===
Several past and present motor racing series have used &quot;GT&quot; in their name. These include:
* LM GTE 1999–2023: A set of regulations for modified road cars, which is used for the 24 Hours of Le Mans race and several related racing series. LM GTE was originally called &#x27;GT class&#x27; and was also known as GT2 class from 2005 to 2010. Also known as GTLM in the United States
* GT World Challenge Europe 2013–present: A racing series for Group GT3 cars. The FIA GT Series replaced the FIA GT Championship (1997–2009) and the FIA GT1 World Championship (2010–2012).
* GT4 European Series 2007–present: A European amateur racing series with the least powerful class of GT cars.
* IMSA GT3 Cup Challenge 2005–present: A North American racing series for Porsche 911 GT3 Cup cars.
* FIA GT3 European Championship 2006–2012: A European amateur racing series for Group GT3 cars.
* FIA R-GT: As part of its structure, the Group R regulations have a provision for GT cars, known as R-GT.

There have also been several classes of racing cars called GT. The Group GT3 regulations for modified road cars have been used for various racing series worldwide since 2006. The Group GT1 regulations were used for the fastest category of sports car racing from 1994 to 2001.

==Examples of grand tourers==
The inclusion of &quot;grand tourer&quot;, &quot;gran turismo&quot;, &quot;GT&quot; or similar in the model name does not necessarily mean that the car is a grand tourer since several manufacturers have used the terms for the marketing of cars that are not grand tourers.

== Evolution of the &quot;gran turismo&quot; car ==
Grand touring car design evolved from vintage and pre-World War II fast touring cars and streamlined closed sports cars.

Italy developed the first &quot;gran turismo&quot; cars. The small, light-weight, and aerodynamic coupés, named the &quot;Berlinetta&quot;, originated in the 1930s. A contemporary French concept, known as &quot;grande routière&quot;, emphasized style, elegance, luxury, and gentlemanly transcontinental touring; the &quot;grande routières&quot; were often larger cars than the Italian &quot;gran turismos&quot;. Italian designers saw that compared to traditional open two-seat sports car, the increase in weight and frontal area of an enclosed cabin for the driver and mechanic could be offset by the benefits of streamlining to reduce drag. Independent &quot;carrozzeria&quot; (coachbuilders) provided light and flexible fabric coachwork for powerful short-wheelbase fast-touring chassis by manufacturers such as Alfa Romeo. Later, Carrozzeria Touring of Milan pioneered sophisticated &quot;superleggera&quot; (super light-weight) aluminum bodywork, allowing for even more aerodynamic forms. The additional comfort of an enclosed cabin was beneficial for the Mille Miglia road race held in Italy&#x27;s often wintry north.

===1929 Alfa Romeo 6C 1750 GT===
The first car to be named &quot;gran turismo&quot; was the 1929 Alfa Romeo 6C 1750 Gran Turismo, a sporting dual-purpose road/race chassis and engine specification that was available with a wide variety of body styles or &quot;carrozzeria&quot;. The influential Weymann fabric-bodied &quot;berlinetta&quot; version by Carrozzeria Touring, &quot;an early example of what we generally perceive to be a GT car&quot;, was winner of the Vetture Chiuse category at the 1931 Mille Miglia. An improved and supercharged version, the 6C 1750 GTC &quot;Gran Turismo Compressore&quot;, won the Vetture a Guida Interna category of the 1932 Mille Miglia. The Alfa Romeo 6C 1750 was designed by Vittorio Jano, who would later be instrumental in the design of the 1951 Lancia Aurelia B20 GT.

===1935 Fiat 508 Balilla S &quot;berlinetta&quot;===
From the basic Fiat 508 Balilla touring chassis came the SIATA and Fiat aerodynamic &quot;gran turismo&quot;-style &quot;Berlinetta Mille Miglias&quot; of 1933 and 1935. Siata was a Turin, Italy-based Fiat tuner, typical of a popular class of Italian artisan manufacturers of small &quot;gran turismo&quot;, sports and racing cars—usually Fiat based—that came to be known in the 1970s as &quot;Etceterini&quot;, such as Nardi, Abarth, Ermini and, in 1946, Cisitalia. The Fiat and SIATA &quot;berlinettas&quot;, influenced by the successful Alfa Romeo 6C GT/GTC coupés, competed in the Mille Miglia endurance race and were significant among Weymann and Superleggera enclosed sporting cars appearing in the 1930s. They featured tuned Fiat engine and chassis, and bespoke &quot;carrozzeria&quot;, in common with the landmark post-war Cisitalia 202 SC, and are among the first small-displacement &quot;gran turismos&quot;.

=== 1947 Cisitalia 202 SC ===
The first recognised motor race specifically for &quot;gran turismo&quot; cars was the 1949 Coppa Inter-Europa held at Monza. It was initially hoped by Italian motor industry observers that the small and struggling Italian sports and racing car manufacturer, Cisitalia, would find in the 1949 Coppa Inter-Europa regulations (initially called &quot;Turismo Veloce&quot; or Fast Touring) a category for its Cisitalia Tipo 202 SC—the road-going production coupé version of Cisitalia&#x27;s single-seat D46 racing car and two-seat 202 open sports car. However, the Fiat-based 1100 cc four-cylinder Cisitalia was no match on the race track for Ferrari&#x27;s new hand-built 2000 cc V12, and Ferrari dominated, taking the first three places. An 1100 cc class was hurriedly created, but not in time to save Cisitalia&#x27;s business fortunes—the company&#x27;s bankrupt owner Piero Dusio had already decamped to Argentina. The Cisitalia 202 SC gained considerable fame for the outstanding design of its Pinin Farina coachwork, and is credited with greatly influencing the style of subsequent &quot;berlinetta&quot; or fastback &quot;gran turismo&quot; coupés. A Cisitalia 202 &quot;GT&quot; is exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.

===1947 Maserati A6 1500===
The Maserati A6 1500 won the 1500 cc class at the 1949 Coppa-Europa. It was driven by Franco Bordoni, former fighter ace of the Regia Aeronautica who had debuted as a &quot;pilota da corsa&quot; at the 1949 Mille Miglia. The A6 1500 was the first road going production car to be offered by the Maserati factory, featuring a tubular chassis with independent front suspension and coil springs, the 1500 cc six-cylinder being derived from the Maserati brothers pre-war &quot;voiturette&quot; racing engines. The body of the A6 1500 was an elegant two-door fast-back coupé body, also by Pinin Farina.

===1949 Ferrari 166 Inter===
Enzo Ferrari, whose Scuderia Ferrari had been the racing division of Alfa Romeo from 1929 until 1938, parted ways from Alfa Romeo in 1939: Enzo Ferrari&#x27;s first car (itself an &quot;Etceterini)&quot; the Fiat-based Auto Avio Costruzioni 815 racing sports car, debuted at the 1940 Mille Miglia. Two were produced. The first car constructed in Ferrari&#x27;s name, the V12 125 S, also a racing sports car, debuted in 1947 at the Piacenza racing circuit. Again, only two were produced, but they rapidly evolved into the 159 and 166 models, including the 1949 Ferrari 166 Inter, a road-going berlinetta coupé with coachwork by Carrozzeria Touring and other coachbuilders.

The Ferrari 166 &#x27;Inter&#x27; S coupé model won the 1949 Coppa Inter-Europa motor race. Regulations stipulated body form and dimensions but did not at this time specify a minimum production quantity. The car was driven by Bruno Sterzi, and is recognized as the first Ferrari &quot;gran turismo&quot;.

After that race, the national governing body of Italian motorsport, CSAI (&quot;Commissione Sportiva Automobilistica Italiana),&quot; officially introduced a new class, called &quot;Gran Turismo Internazionale&quot;, for cars with production over thirty units per year, thereby ruling out Ferrari&#x27;s hand-built &quot;berlinettas&quot;.

=== 1951 Ferrari 212 Export ===
Ferrari&#x27;s response for the new Italian &quot;Gran Turismo Internazionale&quot; championship in 1951 was the road/race Ferrari 212. Twenty-seven short-wheelbase competition versions called Export, some with increasingly popular &quot;gran turismo&quot;-style &quot;berlinetta&quot; coupé coachwork, were produced for enthusiasts (Ferrari called the first example 212 &quot;MM&quot;) while the road version was called &quot;Inter&quot;. The Ferrari 212 Export featured long-range fuel tanks, high compression pistons and triple Weber 32 DCF carburettors; power was 170 bhp from the 2600cc Gioacchino Colombo-designed &#x27;short-block&#x27; V12 engine, evolved from the earlier Ferrari 166 (2000cc) and 195 (2300cc). All versions came with the standard Ferrari five-speed non-synchromesh gearbox and hydraulic drum brakes. All 1951 Ferraris shared a double tube frame chassis design evolved from the 166. Double-wishbone front suspension with transverse leaf spring, and live rear axle with semi-elliptic leaf springs and radius rods were employed. The Ferrari 212 Export (212 MM) &quot;gran turismo berlinetta&quot; (chassis No. 0070M) debuted in first-place overall at the April 1951 Coppa Inter-Europa, driven by Luigi Villoresi, and in June (chassis no. 0092E) was first in the &quot;gran turismo&quot; category at the Coppa della Toscana driven by Milanese Ferrari concessionaire and proprietor of Scuderia Guastalla, Franco Cornacchia. The 212 Export continued to serve Ferrari well in the Sports and GT categories until replaced by the 225 S, and although it would later be overshadowed by the internationally famous 250 GT, the 212 Export was an important model in the successful line of Colombo-engined V12 GT cars that made Ferrari legendary.

=== 1951 Lancia Aurelia B20 GT ===
1951 was the stunning debut of Lancia&#x27;s Aurelia B20 GT.

Lancia had begun production in 1950 of their technically advanced Aurelia saloon; the design had been overseen by Vittorio Jano. At the 1951 Turin Motor Show, the Pinin Farina-bodied &quot;gran turismo&quot; B20 coupé version was unveiled to an enthusiastic motoring public. Here, finally, according to historians Jonathan Wood and Sam Dawson, was a fully realized production GT car, representing the starting point of the definitive grand tourer:

This outwardly conventional saloon bristled with innovation and ingenuity, in which the masterly hand of Vittorio Jano is apparent. In the B20 are elements of the Cistalia of 1947, coupés which Pinin undertook on a 6C Alfa Romeo and Maserati in 1948, along with the Fiat 1100 S coupé with its rear accommodation for children. The original Aurelia had been under-powered and, in 1951, the V6 was enlarged to 1991 cc, which was also extended to the coupé, though in 75 rather than 70 bhp form as the B20 was developed as a sporting model in its own right. In addition the B20 had a shorter wheelbase and a higher rear axle ratio, making it a 100 mph car. Lancia chose the &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; name for its new model and the suggestion could only have come from Vittorio Jano himself, for had he not been responsible for the original 1750 Alfa Romeo of the same name back in 1929?

Four &quot;semi-ufficiali&quot; works B20 GTs, together with a number of privateer entrants, were sent to the Mille Miglia in April 1951, where the factory Bracco / Maglioli car finished second overall, behind only a Ferrari sports racer of twice the engine capacity. Lancia Aurelias swept the GT 2.0 Liter division. In June 1951, Bracco was partnered with the &quot;father of GT racing&quot; himself, Johnny Lurani, to race a B20 GT at Le Mans, where they were victorious in the 2.0 liter sportscar division, placing a very creditable 12th overall. A 1–2 finish at the famous Coppa d&#x27;Oro delle Dolomiti, among other victories including the 6 Ore di Pescara, rounded out an astonishing debut racing season for this ground-breaking car, winning its division in the Italian GT Championship for Umberto Castiglioni in 1951. Lancia B20 GTs would go on to win the over 2.0 liter Italian GT Championship in 1953, 1954 and 1955 with the B20-2500.

=== 1952 Fiat 8V &quot;Otto Vu&quot; Zagato ===
A surprise to the international press, who were not expecting a &quot;gran turismo berlinetta&quot; from Italy&#x27;s largest manufacturer of everyday standard touring models, the Fiat 8V &quot;Otto Vu&quot; was unveiled at the Geneva Salon in March 1952 to international acclaim. Although not raced by the factory, the Otto Vu &quot;was&quot; raced by a number of private owners. Vincenzo Auricchio and Piero Bozzinio raced to fifth in the &quot;gran turismo&quot; category of the 1952 Mille Miglia, and Ovidio Capelli placed third in the GT 2000 cc class at the Coppa della Toscana in June, with a special race-spec lightweight Zagato coupe; the GT category overall at this event was won by Franco Cornacchia&#x27;s Ferrari 212 Export (refer above). Capelli and the 8V Zagato topped this accomplishment by winning the GT category of the Pescara 12 Hours in August, ahead of two Lancias. The new Fiat 8V garnered sufficient competition points over the season to become the national two-liter GT Champion (a feat it repeated every year until 1959).

Elio Zagato, the coachbuilder&#x27;s son, was successful in competition with the Otto Vu in 1954 and 1955, attracting further customer interest and leading Zagato to eventually develop two different GT racing versions. Upon his passing in 2009, Elio Zagato was described as a leading figure of Italian GT racing and design:

Elio Zagato, who has died aged 88, was one of the leading figures of Italian Gran Turismo (GT) racing and car-body design. In the 1950s, driving a Zagato-bodied Fiat 8V, Elio emerged as the consummate gentleman racer in Italian GT championship events. Zagato, his father&#x27;s firm, provided the lithe, lightweight aluminium bodies for many of the Lancias, Alfa Romeos, Abarths and Maseratis that dominated these meetings. Elio won 82 races out of the 150 he entered, and won four of the five championships he entered. Working with the chief stylist Ercole Spada, Zagato produced some of the most beautiful GT designs of the era; spare and muscular cars such as the Aston Martin DB4GTZ, the Alfa Romeo Junior TZ and SZ, and the Lancia Flaminia Sport. These were minimalist shapes bereft of superfluous trim that introduced phrases such as &quot;double bubble&quot; roof to the car body design language: twin shallow domes, devised by Elio, to give extra head room and strengthen the roof. For lightness, Zagato pioneered the use of Perspex and of aerodynamics, with trademark forms such as the split or stub tail. Indeed, Elio would take prototypes out on the autostrada covered in wool tufts in order to test air flow over the body.

The 8V Otto Vu earned its name courtesy of its high-performance V8 engine (Ford having already trademarked &quot;V8&quot;).

=== 1954 Mercedes-Benz 300SL ===
The German automotive industry was devastated by the second World War, but in the post-war period a small number of firms brought it to prominence again. The emergence of the classic Porsche 356 is covered in the accompanying sports car article. In 1957 author John Stanford wrote: &quot;The post-war Mercedes sports cars are in a way even more remarkable than those of Porsche. The firm was particularly badly hit by the war and it was several years before anything but a nominal production of cars could be undertaken. In 1951 appeared the &quot;300&quot;, a luxurious and fast touring car with a single-camshaft six-cylinder engine of 2996 c.c. and chassis derived from the pre-war cars with swing-axle rear suspension. The &quot;300S&quot; was a three-carburetor edition, but in 1952 great interest was aroused by the almost invincible performance in sports-car racing of a team of prototype cars of extremely advanced and interesting design. By 1954 these had undergone sufficient development to be placed on the market as the &quot;300SL&quot;, one of the costliest and most desirable cars of our time. The conventional chassis has been abandoned in favor of a complex structure of welded tubes, although the coil spring suspension is retained, and exceptionally large brakes are fitted, inboard at the rear. The engine is sharply inclined to the near-side in the interests of a low bonnet-line, and with Bosch fuel injection produces 240 b.h.p. at 6,000 r.p.m. Claimed maximum speed is in excess of 160 m.p.h. and although the car is by no means small, dry weight has been kept to 23 cwt. The depth of the multi-tubular frame prevents the use of conventional side-hinged doors and these cars are fitted with the roof-hinged &quot;gull-wing&quot; doors which characterize an exceedingly handsome and practical car. An open touring version is available. In competition the &quot;300SL&quot; has become a powerful contender, and abetted by the success of the Grand Prix cars [and &quot;300 SLR&quot;] has captured a substantial portion of the export market.&quot;

=== 1956 Ferrari 250 GT ===
1953 saw the first serious attempt to series produce the Ferrari motor car, two models of the Type 250 Europa being produced. The cars were an evolution of the previous models, available with either the Colombo or Lampredi versions of the 250 V12 engine, coil spring front suspension, an improved sports gearbox (four speeds) with Porsche synchromesh, large drum brakes and luxurious outfitting. A few appeared in motorsports but did not initially threaten the international Mercedes-Benz 300 SL and Porsche 356 competition.

After its 1956 debut, the 250 GT &quot;went from strength to strength&quot;. Powered by the Colombo 250 engine, output was up to 240 b.h.p. at 7,000 r.p.m. A short-wheelbase (SWB) version of the 250 chassis was employed for improved handling and road-holding in corners, and top speed was up to 157 m.p.h. In 1957 Gendebien finished third overall in the Mille Miglia, and won the &quot;index of performance&quot;. Alfonso de Portago won the Tour de France and GT races at Montlhéry and Castelfusano in a lightweight Carrozzeria Scaglietti 250 GT. Gendebien became a &quot;gran turismo&quot; specialist in 250 GTs when he wasn&#x27;t driving sports racing Ferrari &quot;Testa Rossas&quot; (&quot;Red Heads&quot; for their red engine covers), achieving success in both the Giro Sicilia and Tour de France.

In 1958, sports racing &quot;Testa Rossas&quot; swept the Manufacturer&#x27;s Championship, and in 1959 the T.R. engine was adapted to the 250 GT. The spark plugs were relocated and each cylinder now had a separate intake port. Larger Weber twin-choke carburetors were employed in a triple configuration (sports racing T.R.s employed six) and some special customer cars had three four-choke Webers (one choke per cylinder). Dry-sump lubrication was employed, and the camshaft valve timing was only slightly less than the full-race &quot;Testa Rossas&quot;. G.T. power was up to 267 b.h.p. at 7,000 r.p.m. (240 b.h.p at 6,800 rpm for road versions). Experiments were conducted with Dunlop disc brakes, which were adopted in 1960, along with an even shorter wheelbase for &quot;competizione&quot; versions.

In 1962, the definitive competition &quot;gran turismo&quot; was unveiled, the 250 GTO. A full &quot;Testa Rossa&quot; engine was employed (albeit with black crinkle-finish engine covers) with six twin-choke Webers. Power was up to 300 b.h.p. at 7,400 r.p.m. and with a lightweight 2000 lb body and chassis: the car was an immediate winner.

In November 2016, it was reported that a 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO was being offered for public sale—normally brokers negotiate deals between extremely wealthy collectors &quot;behind closed doors&quot;. GTOs had previously been auctioned in 1990 and 2014. The 2017 sale was expected to reach US$56,000,000.00, the particular GTO concerned (the second of just thirty-six ever made) thus set to become the world&#x27;s most expensive car.

==Impact of racing==
The Italian Mille Miglia thousand-mile race, held from 1927 to 1957, was central to the evolution of the &quot;gran turismo&quot; concept. The event was one of the most important on the Italian motor-sport calendar and could attract up to five million spectators. Winning drivers such as Tazio Nuvolari, Rudolf Caracciola, and Stirling Moss; and manufacturers such as Alfa Romeo, BMW, Ferrari and Porsche would become household names.

According to Enzo Ferrari:

In my opinion, the Mille Miglia was an epoch-making event, which told a wonderful story. The Mille Miglia created our cars and the Italian car industry. The Mille Miglia permitted the birth of GT, or grand touring cars, which are now sold all over the world. The Mille Miglia proved that by racing over open roads for 1,000 miles, there were great technical lessons to be learned by the petrol and oil companies and by brake, clutch, transmission, electrical and lighting component manufacturers, fully justifying the old adage that motor racing improves the breed.

The Mille Miglia is still celebrated today as one of the world&#x27;s premier historic racing events.

A closed sports coupé almost prevailed at Le Mans in 1938, when a &quot;carrozzeria&quot; touring-bodied Alfa Romeo 8C 2900B, driven by Raymond Sommer and Clemente Biondetti, led the famous 24-hour race from the third lap until early Sunday afternoon, retiring only due to engine problems.

Johnny Lurani was impressed by the dominant performance at the Mille Miglia in 1940, by a &quot;carrozzeria&quot; touring-bodied BMW 328 coupé, winning the event at over 100 mph average speed, driven by Fritz Huschke von Hanstein and Walter Bäumer:

The BMW team included a splendid aerodynamic &quot;Berlinetta&quot;, wind tunnel designed by German specialists, that was extremely fast at 135 mph... I couldn&#x27;t believe the speeds these BMWs were capable of.

===1937–1948 CSAI===
Italy&#x27;s national governing body of motorsport was the &quot;Commissione Sportiva Automobilistica Italiana&quot; (CSAI). Count Giovanni Lurani Cernuschi (popularly known as Johnny Lurani) was a key commissioner. He was also a senior member of the world governing body, the &quot;Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile&quot; (FIA).

Lurani was instrumental in designing the regulations for the Italian 1937 &quot;Turismo Nazionale&quot; championship, whereby production vehicles approved by the CSAI were raced with the original chassis and engine layout as specified in the factory catalog and available for customers to buy; engines could be tuned and bored out, but the bodywork had to conform to regulations. The CSAI were concerned that FIA (known as AIACR at the time) &#x27;Annexe C&#x27; Sports cars were becoming little more than thinly-disguised two-seat Grand Prix racers, far removed from the cars ordinary motorists could purchase from the manufacturers&#x27; catalogs.

The CSAI was shut down by the Italian Fascist government under Mussolini at the end of 1937, and replaced with a new organization called FASI. The Italian Fascists, as in Nazi Germany, sought control of motor racing as an important vehicle for national prestige and propaganda. FASI replaced &quot;Turismo Nazionale&quot; with the less strictly regulated &quot;Sports Nazionale&quot; championship, which ran in 1938 and 1939.

Postwar, the CSAI was re-established and in 1947 Italian national championships were held for both &quot;Sports Internazionale&quot; (FIA Annexe C sports cars) and &quot;Sports Nazionale&quot;. &quot;Sports Nazionale&quot; was abolished in 1948, creating the opportunity for a new category in 1949.

=== 1949 Coppa Inter-Europa ===
The first race specifically for grand touring motor cars (at the time the regulations, designed by Johnny Lurani, were actually called &quot;turismo veloce&quot;, or &#x27;fast touring&#x27;) was the 1949 Coppa Inter-Europa, held over three hours on 29 May, at the 6.3 kilometer Autodromo Nazionale di Monza (Italy). It was won by a limited production, V-12 engined, Ferrari 166 &quot;inter&quot;, originally known as the &quot;sport&quot;, with a coupé body by Carrozzeria Touring of Milan with the Superleggera system.

After this race, governing body CSAI officially introduced a new category, called &quot;Gran Turismo Internazionale&quot;, for 1950. The regulations were drawn up by Johnny Lurani and fellow Italian motor racing journalist and organizer Corrado Filippini, requiring for qualification the production of thirty models per year, thereby ruling out, for the time being, Ferrari&#x27;s hand-built &quot;berlinettas&quot;. Nonetheless, Ferrari 166 (including the upgraded MM - Mille Miglia - version) were produced and raced in sports car categories as both open &quot;barchettas&quot; and closed &quot;berlinettas,&quot; including winning the 1950 Mille Miglia outright.

=== 1950 Mille Miglia ===
On the third weekend of April 1950, it was the occasion of the annual Mille Miglia, one-thousand miles from Brescia to Rome and back over closed public roads, to include a &quot;Gran Turismo Internazionale&quot; category for the first time: twenty-four GT cars were entered, including Alfa Romeo 6C 2500 SS coupé touring, Cisitalia 202B &quot;berlinetta&quot; and Fiat 1100 S coupé. The field was rounded out by a solitary Fiat-based Siata Daina. Alfa Romeo took first place in the &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; &quot;Internazionale&quot; category (a creditable tenth overall) and also second place in category, followed by three Cisitalias. The overall race winning Ferrari 195 S was also a &quot;gran turismo&quot;-style coupé, but in the over 2,000 sports car class—in fact a special 166MM/195S &quot;Berlinetta Le Mans&quot;, chassis No. 0026MM, famously driven by Giannino Marzotto in a double-breasted suit, &quot;a fitting advertisement for his family&#x27;s textile business&quot;.

=== 1950 Coppa Inter-Europa ===
The 1950 Coppa Inter-Europa at Monza was held in March. Separate races were held for sports cars, and for &quot;gran turismo&quot; cars in four classes: 750, 1100, 1500, and over 1500.

Ferrari entered, and won, the Sports car 2000 class with a Ferrari 166 MM &quot;berlinetta&quot;, while an Alfa Romeo &quot;Sperimentale&quot; (over 2000 class) won the sports car race overall.

The &quot;gran turismo&quot; race was contested by Lancia Aprilia, Cisitalia 202B, Stanguellini GT 1100, Fiat 500, Alfa Romeo 2500 and Fiat Zagato. The overall winner was WWII fighter ace Franco Bordoni&#x27;s Maserati A6 1500.

=== 1950 Targa Florio ===
The annual Targa Florio in Sicily was held the first weekend of April, and featured a &quot;Gran Turismo Internazionale&quot; category for the first time, in two classes: 1500 and over 1500. Contested by Lancia Aprilia, Cisitalia 202, Fiat 1100, Maserati A6, and even a solitary British Bristol 400 (based on the successful pre-war BMW 328), the &quot;Gran Turismo Internazionale&quot; category was won by Argentinian driver, Adolfo Schwelm Cruz, in an Alfa Romeo 6C 2500 SS.

Schwelm Cruz and Alfa Romeo repeated their success in the 1950 Targa Florio and Mille Miglia by winning the &quot;gran turismo&quot; category at the Coppa della Toscana in June. An Alfa Romeo 6C 2500, driven by Salvatore Amendola, was also victorious in the &quot;gran turismo&quot; category of the Coppa d&#x27; Oro delle Dolomiti in July, run through the Dolomite Mountains, starting and finishing in the town of Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo. An Alfa Romeo 6C 2500 took the &quot;gran turismo&quot; honours again at the Giro delle Calabria in August. The Alfa Romeo 6C 2500 was based on a pre-war design, and is considered by some to be the last of the classic Alfa Romeos.

=== 1951 Campionato Gran Turismo Internazionale ===
For 1951, the CSAI organized an Italian national championship for the &quot;Gran Turismo Internazionale&quot; category in four classes: 750, 1,500, 2,000, and over 2,000 cc. Interest was attracted from manufacturers such as Alfa Romeo, Lancia, Maserati, Ferrari, Fiat and SIATA. The championship was held over ten events, including all the classic long-distance road races (the Giro di Sicilia, the Mille Miglia, the Coppa della Toscana, the Giro dell&#x27;Umbria, the Coppa d&#x27; Oro delle Dolomiti, the Giro delle Calabrie and the Stella Alpina) as well as three circuit races (the Coppa Inter-Europa at Monza, the Circuito di Caracalla night-race in Rome, and the 6 Ore di Pescara).

=== 1954 FIA Appendix J ===
Prior to 1954, internationally agreed motor-sport regulations existed only for racing cars and sports cars (FIA Appendix C). After a testy initial period, the FIA introduced for the 1954 motor racing calendar new &quot;Appendix J&quot; regulations covering production touring cars, tuned special touring cars, &quot;gran turismo&quot; cars, and production sports cars. This was the first officially sanctioned international recognition of the &quot;gran turismo&quot; category.

The 1954 &quot;gran turismo&quot; regulations stipulated cars for personal transport with closed bodywork built by the manufacturer of the chassis, although open bodies and special coachwork were admissible if listed in the official catalog of the manufacturer of the chassis and if the weight of the car was at least the same as the closed standard model. Minimum production was 100 cars during 12 months and cars needed to have only two seats.

&quot;Gran turismo&quot; categories (under 1500 and over 1500) were first included in the World Sportscar Championship in round three of the 1954 season at the 1954 Mille Miglia (the first placed GT car being the Lancia Aurelia B20 GT of Serafini and Mancini). GT entries would become a regular feature alongside their sports car brethren at international races from this time forward: GT cars raced in world championship rounds at the Targa Florio from 1955, Nürburgring from 1956, Sebring from 1957, 24 Hours of Le Mans from 1959, and Buenos Aires from 1960 (from which year every round of the world championship included GT cars). In 1960 and 1961 an FIA &quot;Coupé de Grand Tourisme&quot; (Grand Touring Cup) was awarded.

In 1962-1984 seasons (except of the 1982 season) World Sportscar Championship titles were awarded to &quot;manufacturers&quot; of GT cars alongside to &quot;manufacturers&quot; of Sports prototypes.

The FIA grand touring category came to be known as &quot;Group 3&quot;, and is defined in the 1961 Appendix J (English) regulation as: &quot;Vehicles built in small series for customers who are looking for better performance and/or maximum comfort and are not particularly concerned about economy. Such cars shall conform to a model defined in a catalog and be offered to the customers by the regular Sales Department of the manufacturer.&quot;

=== 1962–1965 International Championship for GT Manufacturers ===
In 1962 the FIA, addressing concerns to reduce the speeds attained in sports car racing following the disastrous accident at Le Mans in 1955, shifted focus from Appendix C sports cars to production based GT cars of Appendix J. The previous World Sportscar Championship title was discontinued, being replaced by the International Championship for GT Manufacturers, won by the Ferrari 250 GTO in 1962, 1963 and 1964.

==== Cobra Ferrari wars ====
The period 1963–1965 is famous for the &quot;Cobra Ferrari wars&quot;, a rivalry between American former-racing driver and Le Mans winner Carroll Shelby (Le Mans 1959, Aston Martin DBR1/300), and Enzo Ferrari, whose 250 GTs were the dominant grand touring cars of the time. Shelby retired from driving due to a heart condition, returning to California from Europe in 1959 with the idea to marry the AC Ace sports car chassis with Ford&#x27;s V-8 small-block engine: the resulting Shelby AC Cobra was a sales success. 

Shelby, like Enzo Ferrari, sold road cars to support his racing team, and like Ferrari the Cobra was a success on the track, at least on the short circuits common in the United States. On the longer tracks prevalent in Europe however, the Cobra&#x27;s crude aerodynamics could not compete with the sleek 180 mph Ferrari 250 GTOs: even fitted with a removable roof the Cobra&#x27;s top speed was 150 mph. At the 1963 24 Hours of Le Mans, a Cobra placed seventh; Ferraris placed first to sixth. Shelby team engineer Pete Brock hand-designed a Kamm-backed aerodynamic body for the Cobra, creating the Shelby Daytona coupe, and a showdown with Ferrari was set.

In testing, the Shelby Daytona coupe attained a top speed of 196 mph, and went on to win the GT class at the 1964 24 Hours of Le Mans. Shelby had beaten Ferrari on the biggest stage; however, the fast and reliable Ferrari 250 GTOs were again victorious in the 1964 International Championship for GT Manufacturers. The championship was controversial: Enzo Ferrari, with only a narrow points lead over Shelby, attempted to have the radical new mid-engined Ferrari LM250 homologated for the final championship round at Monza in Italy. When the FIA turned Ferrari down, Ferrari withdrew. The race organizers Auto Club d&#x27;Italia, fearing a financial disaster from the withdrawal of the famous Italian team, canceled the event, and Ferrari was crowned world champion. In the aftermath, Ferrari declared he would never race GTs again, and for 1965 the rivalry with Ferrari was taken up by Ford Motor Company and the Ford GT40, also mid-engined, in the sports car divisions.

In 1965, with Shelby&#x27;s race team now dedicated to the GT40, the Daytona coupes were entrusted to Alan Mann Racing in the United Kingdom, and easily won the GT world championship. From 1966, the FIA returned its world championship focus to the sports car division, but GT entries remained an important feature of international sports car racing.

== British grand tourers 1946–1963 ==
While Italy was the home of the &quot;gran turismo&quot;, of all the other European nations that took the concept up, it was Britain that was most enthusiastic.

=== 1946 Healey Elliot ===
Before Donald Healey turned to production of the small, light and inexpensive Austin-Healey 100 sports car in 1952, he had brought to market a fast and aerodynamic 2-liter Riley-powered Healey Elliot closed saloon (named for the coach-builder). Claimed to be the fastest closed car of its day, only 101 were made before production was given over to the successful new sports car.

=== 1947 Bristol 400–406 ===
Immediately following the Second World War, H. J. Aldington, pre-war Frazer Nash manufacturer and BMW importer, sought out BMW&#x27;s badly bombed Munich factory and there discovered the special-bodied open BMW 328, duly returning with it to Britain with a view to building Fraser Nash-BMWs with the aid of key former-BMW personnel. The Bristol Aeroplane Company, looking to enter the car sector, acquired a majority shareholding. There were government concerns about using German engineers, and in the end, only Fritz Fiedler was involved as consultant to Bristol&#x27;s own engineers. By the time the new car debuted at the 1947 Geneva Motor Show, it was known simply as the Bristol 400.

The Bristol 400 was essentially a hand-built, to aircraft industry standards, BMW 327 two-door coupe, mounted on a BMW 326 chassis, powered by the legendary 2-liter BMW 328 engine. It was fast, 90 mph, but expensive. The 1948 401 featured an improved aerodynamic body in the lightweight Touring Superleggera fashion; and the 1953 403 boasted improved suspension, brakes, and gearbox, while power was boosted from 85 to 100 bhp. The 1954 short-chassis 404 had a completely new body, and top speed was up to 110 mph. The 1958 406 was the last of the BMW-powered versions and was produced until 1961, after which they were superseded by a range of automatic transmission equipped and Chrysler V8 powered Bristols, with the engines rebuilt by Bristol engineers and fitted with high-lift camshafts and mechanical lifters.

=== 1953 Aston Martin DB2 ===
David Brown purchased the Aston Martin concern in 1947, and the company was effectively reborn for the post-war era. Unlike the Bristol, the Aston Martin DB2 which debuted at the 1949 Motor Show (as a prototype Le Mans racer) was an all-British affair. The 2.6-liter twin overhead camshaft Lagonda engine was designed by W. O. Bentley (Brown having also purchased the Lagonda company). Brown decided on a closed coupé body in the latest Italian tradition, rather than the traditional Aston Martin open two-seater sports car. The 1950 production DB2 was a styling triumph for designer Frank Feeley, and Brown later recalled that many believed the car styled in Italy. The 105 bhp DB2 was a genuine 110 mph grand tourer; in 1951 came the more powerful optional 125 bhp &quot;Vantage&quot; version. In its original form, the DB2 was a two-seater; the 1953 DB2/4 added a 2+2 and hatchback arrangement and a 3-liter engine in 1954. A Mark II version with Tickford coachwork appeared in 1955 (Brown had purchased this company too). The Mark III version from 1957 to 1959 developed 162 bhp, and was available with 180 and 195 bhp high-output engine options.

<doc id="676559" wikidata="Q273262" url="?curid=676559" title="Helen Schucman">
<text>Helen Cohn Schucman (born Helen Dora Cohn,July 14, 1909 – February 9, 1981) was an American clinical psychologist and research psychologist. She was a professor of medical psychology at Columbia University in New York from 1958 until her retirement in 1976. Schucman is best known for having &quot;scribed&quot; with the help of colleague William Thetford the book &quot;A Course in Miracles&quot; (first edition, 1975), the contents of which she claimed had been given to her by an inner voice she identified as Jesus. At her request, her role as its &quot;writer&quot; was not revealed to the general public until after her death.

==Early life and education==
Schucman was born Helen Dora Cohn in 1909 to Sigmund Cohn, a prosperous metallurgical chemist, and Rose Black, the daughter of a former rabbi from Germany. They married on October 18, 1896, in Manhattan, and Schucman had an elder brother, Adolph Cohn, who was almost 12 years her senior. Though her parents were both half-Jewish, they were non-observant. Schucman&#x27;s mother Rose had an interest in Theosophy and various expressions of Christianity such as Christian Science and the Unity School of Christianity.

The family housekeeper, Idabel, a Baptist, had the deepest religious influence on Schucman while she was growing up. In 1921, when she was 12, Schucman visited Lourdes, France, where she had a spiritual experience, and in 1922 she was baptized as a Baptist. Later in life, she considered herself an atheist.

She received her B.A. from New York University, where she met fellow student Louis Schucman in 1932. They married in a 10-minute ceremony at a local rabbi&#x27;s office, on May 26, 1933. Louis owned one or more bookstores on &quot;Book Row&quot; in Manhattan, and during the early years of their marriage Schucman worked at his main store. Growing restless in her early forties, she returned to NYU to study psychology. She received her M.A. in 1952, followed by her Ph.D. in 1957.

==Career==

Schucman was a clinical and research psychologist, who held the tenured position of Associate Professor of Medical Psychology at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City. During her tenure at Columbia University, Schucman worked with William Thetford, whom she first met in early 1958.

&quot;A Course in Miracles&quot; (ACIM) was &quot;scribed&quot; by Schucman between 1965 and 1972 through a process of inner dictation. She experienced the process as one of a distinct and clear dictation from an inner voice, which earlier had identified itself to her as Jesus. Her scribing of &quot;A Course in Miracles&quot; began with these words: &quot;This is a course in miracles. Please take notes.&quot;

Wouter Hanegraaff distinguishes Schucman&#x27;s process as a type of channeling that articulates revelation, clarifying that &quot;in cases of inner dictation in which the medium hears a voice dictating messages, (s)he writes down [these messages] in a fully conscious state.&quot; Hanegraaff continues by specifically characterizing Schucman&#x27;s case as spontaneous channeling, indicating that &quot;[o]ver the years the voice proved to be remarkably consistent, stopping the dictation when interrupted [by Schucman&#x27;s daily activities] and continuing at the next opportunity.&quot; Hanegraaff also references specific dialogue between Schucman and William Thetford, citing author Robert E. Skutch, among other authors, including Kenneth Wapnick, whom Hanegraaff cites as a good source for discussion of this subject.

During this time, Schucman worked in a collaborative venture with William Thetford in scribing &quot;A Course In Miracles&quot; (ACIM) and also with its initial edits. The main transcription process took seven years, from 1965 to 1972, during which she took notes in shorthand, then each day read these notes to Thetford, who typed them out while she read them. After all the ACIM material had been initially transcribed it was edited for publication by Schucman and the other two primary editors, Thetford and Wapnick.
Schucman also wrote two supplemental ACIM pamphlets by the same process as well as a collection of poetry later published as &quot;The Gifts of God&quot;. Following the transcription and editing, Schucman began to reduce the level of her direct involvement in ACIM and was never as heavily involved with teaching or popularizing the material as Thetford and Wapnick.

==Death==
In 1980 Schucman was diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer. After a prolonged illness, she died of related complications at age 71 in 1981.

==Legacy==
A collection of her poems, &quot;The Gifts of God&quot;, was posthumously published by the Foundation for Inner Peace.

&quot;Absence From Felicity: The Story of Helen Schucman and Her Scribing of A Course in Miracles&quot; is the only biography of Schucman. It was written by her longtime friend, Kenneth Wapnick.

Wapnick later founded the Foundation for A Course in Miracles (FACIM), an organization that claimed to hold a copyright to &quot;A Course In Miracles&quot;. Upon Wapnick&#x27;s death in 2013, the purported copyright to &quot;A Course In Miracles&quot; reverted to the Foundation For Inner Peace (FIP).

<doc id="676561" wikidata="Q3518390" url="?curid=676561" title="Bharat Rashtra Samithi">
<text>The Bharat Rashtra Samithi (; BRS), formerly known as Telangana Rashtra Samithi ( TRS), is an Indian political party which is predominantly active in the state of Telangana and currently the primary opposition party in the state. It was founded on 27 April 2001 by K. Chandrashekar Rao, with a single-point agenda of creating a separate Telangana state with Hyderabad as its capital. It has been instrumental in carrying forth a sustained agitation for the granting of statehood to Telangana.
In the 2014 Telangana Assembly Election, the party won a majority of seats and formed the first government of the State with K. Chandrashekar Rao as its chief minister. In the 2014 general election the party won 11 seats, making it the eighth largest party in Lok Sabha, the lower house (lok sabha) of the Indian Parliament.
After a landslide victory in 2018 Telangana Legislative Assembly election, the party formed the government in the State for the second time. In the 2019 Indian general election, the party&#x27;s tally had fallen to nine seats in the Lok Sabha. As of September 2024, the party holds four seats in upper house of Rajya Sabha.

Later on 5 October 2022, the name of the party was changed from Telangana Rashtra Samithi to Bharat Rashtra Samithi to foray into the national politics. After suffering a decisive defeat in the 2023 Telangana Legislative Assembly election, the party was restricted to winning only 39 seats in the state of Telangana.

==Ideology==

On 27 April 2001, Rao resigned as Deputy Speaker of the Telugu Desam Party. He opined that Telangana people were being categorically discriminated against within the undivided State of Andhra Pradesh. Consequently, Rao argued that only the creation of a separate State of Telangana would allow for the alleviation of the people&#x27;s predicament. Accordingly, KCR founded the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) Party at Jala Drushyam, Hyderabad in April 2001, with the objective of achieving statehood for Telangana. The party initially won one-third of Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and one-quarter of Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) in Siddipet within sixty days of the formation of the party.

==Politics==
=== 2004 elections ===
In the aftermath of 2004 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly election, the party won 26 state assembly seats and also won five parliament seats. The TRS formed an alliance with Indian National Congress and joined the United Progressive Alliance. In September 2006, the party withdrew support for the central government on the grounds of indecision by the government over the delivery of its electoral promise to create Telangana. On 13 September 2006, Rao triggered a by-election in his Lok Sabha constituency of Karimnagar, claiming provocation from Congress MLA M. Satyanarayana Rao and citing delay in the formation of Telangana state, as promised by Congress in its 2004 manifesto. He won the subsequent by-election with a strong majority. All TRS MLAs and MPs resigned their positions in April 2008 when the Central government did not meet their demand for a separate state in its latest budget session. The by-election was held on 29 May 2008. In the 2008 by-elections, TRS retained only seven out of the 16 assembly segments and two out of the four Lok Sabha segments that it resigned, a significant defeat for the party. TRS president K. Chandrasekhar Rao offered to resign after the by-election losses, but instead remained in office after other party leaders rejected the resignation.

=== 2009 elections ===

In 2009, TRS formed an alliance with TDP and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance. The party contested 45 assembly and nine parliament seats to win only ten assembly and two parliament seats. This was considered another major defeat.

===2014 elections===
In the 2014 Assembly and National Elections, TRS did not align with NDA or UPA and fought the elections on its own. TRS, which led the campaign for a separate State for more than a decade, emerged victorious by winning 11 of the 17 Lok Sabha seats and 63 of the 119 Assembly seats, and emerged as the party with the largest vote share in Telangana. The TRS&#x27; campaign had no other stars except KCR who addressed over 300 public meetings, heli-hopping around and often addressing more than 10 meetings in a single day. The TRS not only retained its north Telangana stronghold but also made inroads in south Telangana, a Congress bastion.

It was only after the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh, and the creation of separate Telangana state that the party begun to deliver electoral success. TRS won 63 out of 110 seats it contested in the 2014 Assembly elections in the newly formed state, and went on to form the government. K. Chandrashekar Rao, had taken oath as the first Chief Minister of the new state of Telangana on 2 June 2014.

===2018 Telangana Legislative Assembly election===
The TRS Government headed by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on 6 September 2018 dissolved the Legislative Assembly, the first after the formation of Telangana, to pave the way for early elections in the state. The party announced a list of 104 candidates for elections on the same day.

In the 2018 Telangana Legislative Assembly election, held three months after the house dissolution, the TRS party won with a massive majority. They won 88 seats, more than 70% of the 119 total.

=== 2019 Indian general election ===
In May 2019, TRS Chief Rao flouted the idea of Federal Front, aiming for a non-Congress and non-BJP government at the centre. The party won nine out of the contested 17 seats, a reduction of two seats from the 2014 election.

=== 2022-present: Name change, electoral setbacks ===

====Bharat Rashtra Samithi====
The name of the party was changed from &quot;Telangana Rashtra Samithi&quot; to &quot;Bharat Rashtra Samithi&quot; on 5 October 2022 to foray into national politics ahead of the 2024 Indian general election. On 6 October 2022, officials from BRS submitted the relevant documents required for name change according to the Representation of the People Act, 1951 to the Election Commission of India in New Delhi. As of October 2022, the party activities are taking place from a rented building at Sardar Patel Marg in Delhi. On 14 November the party office was inaugurated at New Delhi.

==== Andhra Pradesh unit ====
The party created its local unit in the residual Andhra Pradesh state on 2 January 2023. Dr. Thota Chandrasekhar, former general secretary of the Jana Sena Party, was named its president. Other leaders from Andhra Pradesh who joined the party on the on its state unit&#x27;s formation include former minister Ravela Kishore Babu, former IRS official Partha Sarathi, and former Praja Rajyam Party leader T. J. Prakash.

The state unit suffered a setback in April 2023 when the Election Commission of India derecognised the BRS as a state party in Andhra Pradesh. The party had been enjoying state party status in Undivided Andhra Pradesh since 2004, and then in the states of residual Andhra Pradesh and Telangana since 2014.

==== 2023 Telangana Legislative Assembly election ====
At the 2023 Telangana Legislative Assembly election, the party lost their majority, with their vote share falling by 10.52% to 37.35% and their seat count falling from 88 to 39. They retained their seats in the Greater Hyderabad region, but lost most of their seats in the rest of the state to Congress, who won 64 seats and formed the next government.

==== 2024 Indian general election ====

The party suffered a further setback at the 2024 Indian General Election. Despite their previous national ambitions, the party only contested in Telangana. However, they were wiped out, losing all 9 of their seats in the state. The party&#x27;s vote share was over cut in half from 41.71% to 16.68%.

<text>The Cathedral Church of the Dormition (), dominating the city of Smolensk, Russia, from Cathedral Hill, has been the principal church of the Smolensk bishopric for 800 years.

== Monomakh Cathedral ==
The first brick church on the spot was started by Vladimir Monomakh in 1101. The large six-pillared edifice, similar to Monomakh&#x27;s cathedral in Vladimir, took several decades to complete. It was finally consecrated during the reign of Vladimir&#x27;s grandson Rostislav of Smolensk in 1150. In the course of the following 500 years, the church survived numerous wars and fires. Especially serious was the damage inflicted during the great siege of Smolensk (1609–1611).

According to the official legend, the remaining defenders of the city locked themselves in the cathedral and then set fire to the gunpowder in the ammunition depot in the church&#x27;s basement on June 3, 1611. The explosion that followed caused the roof to collapse, killing all the people inside, who preferred death to being taken prisoner by the Poles. It is unclear, though, what happened in reality except that the ammunition depot in the basement really did explode. It was not unusual in medieval Russia for civilians to seek asylum in churches when a city was overrun, so it was likely civilians, rather than defenders, who died in that explosion. What caused the explosion will probably forever remain an open question: it could have been a Masada-style suicide but it might well have been an accident.

The old cathedral survived the explosion, however. On September 9, 1627, the bishop Lew Rzewuski pleaded Lew Sapieha to preclude &quot;the 500-year-old church&quot; from being converted into a Roman Catholic church, which would violate the terms of Smolensk&#x27;s surrender to the Poles in 1611. In a 1636 engraving, the cathedral is represented as being covered with a temporary wooden roof.
After Smolensk was recaptured by the tsars and recognized as belonging to Russia in the 1667 peace treaty, the Russian voivode Prince Repnin was commissioned to inspect the cathedral and to prepare a list of urgent repairs. In 1673 the archbishop of Smolensk was authorized to restore the roof and the domes without damaging its original walls. The ancient bricks, however, proved too dilapidated to put to good use. The old cathedral was completely demolished between May 5 and July 13, 1674.

== New cathedral ==
The current six-pillared, five-domed edifice was constructed over a period of almost 100 years due to flaws in the original design and its implementation – at one point one of the walls collapsed – but it was eventually completed in 1772. The building’s Baroque design is impressive, especially looking up from the base of a wall. Viewed from certain locations it often looks as if it is suspended in the air because it is situated on hill surrounded by trees, concealing the base of the building.

One of the most notable views is inside the cathedral, namely the iconostasis that separates the altar from the nave area of the cathedral, which stands almost the height of the interior space. On it there are icons and interspaced with intricate gold-covered wooden decorations including figures of cherubim and columns entwined with vine branches.

According to local legend, when Napoleon Bonaparte entered the cathedral after Smolensk had fallen to the French army in 1812, he looked up at the altar wall and proclaimed that if any one of his soldiers dared to steal anything from it, he would personally kill that man. The cathedral sustained enormous damage during World War II, when the 11th-century miraculous icon of Theotokos of Smolensk perished in a great fire.

The cathedral appears in Christian Bot&#x27;s 2013 novel &quot;When we were Heroes&quot;, in the context of the 1812 Battle of Smolensk.

<text>La Tour d&#x27;Argent (, ) is a historic restaurant in the 5th arrondissement of Paris, France. It is located at 15 Quai de la Tournelle. It has a rating of one star from the &quot;Guide Michelin&quot;.

== History ==

The restaurant claims that it was founded in 1582, and that it was frequented by Henri IV, but offers no documentation to support these or other claims about its history. The Quai de la Tournelle, where the restaurant stands, was not paved until 1650, before which it was &quot;a slope, often flooded and almost always made inaccessible by mud&quot;. The restaurant today is at the corner of the , which did not exist until the end of the eighteenth century.

The restaurant does not appear in an 1824 list of &quot;The principal restaurants, who are distinguished by the elegance of the decoration of their salons and by the number and the care taken with the dishes found there...&quot;. 
In 1852, a metals dealer occupied number 15 Quai de la Tournelle, and a hairdresser and wood dealer number 17.

Baedeker&#x27;s 1860 guide to Paris describes the establishment&#x27;s current location as &quot;out of the way&quot;, while mentioning a restaurant associated with a low-cost &quot;Hotel of the Tour d&#x27;Argent&quot;: &quot;Between Notre Dame and the jardin des Plantes, on the Quai de la Tournelle, facing the bridge of this name, there is a little hotel and the restaurant Lecoq; Hôtel de la Tour d&#x27;argent, a bit out of the way, it is true, but well kept and cheap (room, 2 francs, beefsteak, 1 franc). Facing a swimming school, which has the advantage of not yet being encumbered and imprisoned by all the filth of Paris.&quot;

The restaurant was owned in the 1890s and 1900s by Frédéric Delair, who began the tradition of presenting a numbered certificate to each person who ate the restaurant&#x27;s signature dish, pressed duck. A dinner was held there for the Wright Brothers in 1906. In 1912, the Terrail family bought the restaurant. It was operated first by André Terrail, then by his son Claude, who died in 2006 at the age of 88, and then by Claude&#x27;s son André.

In 1984, a branch was opened in Tokyo, in the Hotel New Otani.

Since 1986, La Tour d&#x27;Argent has been a recipient of the &quot;Wine Spectator&quot; Grand Award.

Until 1996, the Guide Michelin awarded the restaurant three stars. The rating was reduced to two stars in 1996, and to one star in 2006.

== Specialities ==
Duck, especially the pressed duck, is the speciality (Canard à la presse, Caneton à la presse, Caneton Tour d&#x27;Argent, and recently renamed “Caneton de Frédéric Delair”). The restaurant raises its ducks on its own farm. Diners who order the duck receive a postcard with the bird&#x27;s serial number, now well over 1 million. (Serial number #112,151 went to U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, #203,728 went to Marlene Dietrich, and #253,652 went to Charlie Chaplin).

The restaurant&#x27;s wine cellar, guarded around the clock, contains more than 450,000 bottles whose value was estimated in 2009 at 25 million euros (£22.5 million). Some 15,000 wines are offered to diners on a 400-page list. During a routine inventory control in 2024, wine worth more than €1.5m was found to be missing from the wine cellar.

The dining room has an excellent view of the river Seine and Notre Dame.

== Cultural references ==
In &quot;Accidental Agent, A thrilling account of underground warfare in France&quot;, John Goldsmith, agent of the British Special Operations Executive, tells how after escaping his German SS captors at Hotel Continentale in the Rue de Rivoli, he was hidden in an upper-floor flat in the Tour d&#x27;Argent building that was occupied by Rumanian actress Madame Tantzy.

In &quot;A Moveable Feast&quot;, Ernest Hemingway says that the Tour d&#x27;Argent rented some rooms and gave its lodgers discounts on the meals; also that a valet there used to sell English books left by the tenants.

Marcel Proust mentions the restaurant three times in his novel &quot;À la recherche du temps perdu&quot; (&quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;). For example, the haughty Mme Verdurin sniffs &quot;The Tour d&#x27;Argent is not nearly as good as they make out&quot;.

In a scene in the 1960 novel &quot;The Centurions&quot; where French prisoners of war are discussing the kinds of meals and cars they plan to buy with their backpay, an officer named Captain Verdier mentions that Lapérouse has been surpassed by Tour d&#x27;Argent in quality, a fact that he finds &quot;most annoying&quot;.

The restaurant inspired scenes in the 2007 Pixar movie &quot;Ratatouille,&quot; and received an &quot;unexpected boost&quot; from the film.

Four episodes of Fuji TV&#x27;s &quot;Iron Chef&quot; had chefs from the Paris and Tokyo branches as challengers. From the Paris branch, Bernard Leprince faced Iron Chef Japanese Komei Nakamura twice, with either chef winning once (Leprince won the initial meeting on the French Special at Chateau de Brissac with salmon as the theme, while Nakamura won the rematch in Tokyo with duck as the theme). Meanwhile, from the Tokyo branch, Tadaaki Shimizu bested Iron Chef French Hiroyuki Sakai with lobster as the theme, while Dominique Corby was the 300th challenger and battled Iron Chef Chinese Chen Kenichi to a draw with foie gras as the regulation theme and asparagus as the overtime theme.

One episode of &quot;Root into Europe&quot; (British comedy starring George Cole) was filmed in the hotel, and the duck being pressed is shown and served to the actors. Claude Terrail appeared as himself.

The restaurant was visited in the Paris episode of &quot;Remarkable Places to Eat&quot; (presented by Fred Sirieix, with Michel Roux Jr. as the guide), featuring the duck being pressed at their table, and a visit to the wine cellar.

<doc id="676576" wikidata="Q158314" url="?curid=676576" title="Klara Hitler">
<text>Klara Hitler ( Pölzl; 12 August 1860 – 21 December 1907) was the mother of Adolf Hitler, dictator of Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945. According to the family physician, Eduard Bloch, she was a quiet, sweet, and affectionate person. In 1934, Adolf Hitler honored his mother by naming a street in Passau after her.

==Family background and marriage==
Klara was born in the Austrian Empire village of Weitra to Johann Baptist Pölzl and Johanna Hiedler. In 1876, 16-year-old Klara was hired as a household servant by her relative Alois Hitler, three years after his first marriage to Anna Glasl-Hörer. Although Alois&#x27;s biological father is unknown, after his mother, Maria Schicklgruber, married Johann Georg Hiedler, Alois was officially designated as Hiedler&#x27;s son. Klara&#x27;s mother was Hiedler&#x27;s niece, making Klara and Alois first cousins once removed.

Alois&#x27;s second wife, Franziska Matzelsberger, died in 1884. Klara and Alois married on 7 January 1885 in a brief ceremony held early in the morning at Hitler&#x27;s rented rooms on the top floor of the Pommer Inn in Braunau am Inn. Alois then went to work for the day at his job as a customs official.

Their first son, Gustav, was born four months later, on 17 May 1885. Ida followed on 23 September 1886. Both infants died of diphtheria during the winter of 1887–88. A third child, Otto, was born and died in 1892. A third son, Adolf, was born on 20 April 1889.

In 1892, Klara and her family took the train to Passau, where they lived for the next two years. Edmund was born there on 24 March 1894. Paula followed on 21 January 1896. Edmund died of measles on 28 February 1900, at the age of five. Of Klara&#x27;s six children, only Adolf and Paula survived to adulthood.

Klara&#x27;s adult life was spent keeping house and raising children, in whom, according to Smith, Alois had little interest. She was very devoted to her children and, according to William Patrick Hitler, was a typical stepmother to her stepchildren, Alois, Jr. and Angela. She was a devout Roman Catholic and attended church regularly with her children.

==Later life and death==

When Alois died in 1903, he left a government pension. Klara sold the house in Leonding and moved with young Adolf and Paula to an apartment in Linz, where they lived frugally. In 1906, Klara discovered a lump in her breast but initially ignored it. After chest pain began keeping her awake at night, she consulted the family doctor, Eduard Bloch, in January 1907. She had been busy with her household, she said, so had neglected to seek medical aid. Bloch chose not to tell Klara that she had breast cancer and left it to Adolf to inform her. Bloch told Adolf that his mother had a small chance of surviving and recommended that she undergo a radical mastectomy. 

The Hitlers were devastated by the news. According to Bloch, Klara &quot;accepted the verdict as I was sure she would—with fortitude. Deeply religious, she assumed that her fate was God&#x27;s will. It would never occur to her to complain.&quot; She underwent the mastectomy at Sisters of St. Mercy in Linz, whereupon the surgeon, Karl Urban, discovered that the cancer had already metastasized to the pleural tissue in her chest. Bloch told Klara&#x27;s children that her condition was terminal. Adolf, who had been in Vienna ostensibly to study art, moved back home to tend to his mother, as did his siblings. 

By October, Klara&#x27;s condition had rapidly declined, and Adolf begged Bloch to try a new treatment. For the next 46 days (from November to early December), Bloch performed daily treatments of iodoform, a then experimental form of chemotherapy. Klara&#x27;s mastectomy incisions were reopened, and massive doses of iodoform-soaked gauze were applied directly to the tissue to &quot;burn&quot; the cancer cells. The treatments were incredibly painful and caused Klara&#x27;s throat to paralyze, leaving her unable to swallow. The treatments proved futile, and Klara Hitler died at home in Linz from the toxic side effects of iodoform on 21 December 1907. She was buried in Leonding, near Linz.

Adolf, who had a close relationship with his mother, was devastated by her death and carried the grief for the rest of his life. Bloch later recalled, &quot;In all my career, I have never seen anyone so prostrate with grief as Adolf Hitler.&quot; In his autobiography &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, Hitler wrote that he had &quot;honored my father but loved my mother&quot; and that his mother&#x27;s death was a &quot;dreadful blow&quot;. Decades later, in 1940, Hitler showed gratitude to Bloch, who was Jewish, for treating his mother, by allowing him to emigrate with his wife from Austria to the United States, a privilege allowed to few other Jews in Austria.

In 1941 and 1943, the Office of Strategic Services (a predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency) interviewed Bloch to gain information about Hitler&#x27;s childhood. He said that Hitler&#x27;s most striking feature was his love for his mother:While Hitler was not a mother&#x27;s boy in the usual sense, I never witnessed a closer attachment. Their love had been mutual. Klara Hitler adored her son. She allowed him his own way whenever possible. For example, she admired his watercolor paintings and drawings and supported his artistic ambitions in opposition to his father, at what cost to herself one may guess.

Bloch expressly denied that Hitler&#x27;s love for his mother was pathological. He remembered Hitler as the &quot;saddest man I had ever seen&quot; when he was informed about his mother&#x27;s imminent death, and viewed Klara as a &quot;pious and kind&quot; woman who &quot;would turn in her grave if she knew what became of him&quot;.

==Removal of tombstone==
On 28 March 2012, a descendant of Alois Hitler removed, without ceremony, the tombstone marking his and Klara&#x27;s grave in Town Cemetery in Leonding, according to Kurt Pittertschatscher, the pastor of the parish. The descendant is said to be an elderly female relative of Alois&#x27;s first wife, Anna, who has also given up any rights to the rented burial plot. It is not known what happened to the remains.

==In popular culture==
In the &quot;I Ain&#x27;t No Holodeck Boy&quot; episode of the animated TV series &quot;American Dad!&quot; (season 10, episode 13, first broadcast March 23, 2014), a main plot point revolves around a video game called &quot;Nazi Natal Nightmare&quot;, in which the players try to kill Adolf while he is still unborn in Klara&#x27;s womb. Roald Dahl&#x27;s short story &quot;Genesis and Catastrophe: A True Story&quot; is a fictional account of Klara immediately after giving birth to Adolf, in which she worries about his health and laments the deaths of her three previous children. Although the story stays true to Klara&#x27;s biography, including the names of her late children, her identity as &quot;Frau Hitler&quot; is not revealed for several pages, providing a macabre twist ending typical of Dahl&#x27;s adult stories.

<text>The China Open was a professional snooker tournament. It was one of a number of ranking tournaments and began in 1997. The final champion is Neil Robertson, who won the event in 2019.

== History ==
The first international snooker tournament in China was the China International in September 1997, a non-ranking tournament for the top 16 players and local players. The following season the tournament became ranking and was held in March. Then the name of the event was changed to China Open and was held in December, so there were two events in 1999. After the 2002 tournament the event was abandoned.

The event was revived for the 2004/05 season. Local wild-card players were invited to play against the qualifiers. The three Chinese players on the tour were invited to play as wild-cards, rather than qualify the usual way. Ding Junhui was one of them, and he won the tournament, but as he entered as a wild-card, he received no prize money nor ranking points.

The last edition of the tournament in 2019 took place at the Olympic Sports Center Gymnasium, Chaoyang District, Beijing in early April, and it was usually the last ranking event before the World Championship. The 2020 edition was scheduled to take place, but the COVID-19 pandemic caused it to be cancelled: the subsequent restrictions meant it was not staged through 2021, 2022 and 2023. Despite the COVID restrictions ending in China, the tournament has not been restored to the calendar, with new events in Wuhan and Xi&#x27;an being staged in its place.

<doc id="676591" wikidata="Q579516" url="?curid=676591" title="Squire">
<text>In the Middle Ages, a squire was the shield- or armour-bearer of a knight. He was responsible for taking care of the horse and arms of the knight. Other duties included carving the knight&#x27;s meat. Despite being a servant, it was a high status job and could serve as training for future knights. Many squires were hired servants with no known pedigree.

Use of the term evolved over time. Initially, a squire could be a knight&#x27;s servant that fought with his lord. It could also refer to sub-knightly Men-at-Arms and was used interchangeably with valet. Over time it referred to a broad social class of men, just below the rank of knight. Eventually, a lord of the manor might come to be known as a &quot;squire&quot;.

==Terminology==
&quot;Squire&quot; is a shortened version of the word &quot;esquire&quot;, from the Anglo-French itself meaning (&quot;shield bearer&quot;). Other terms include &quot;scutifer&quot; and the Latin (&quot;arms bearer&quot;).

==Squire==
The duties of a squire was to take care of the knight’s armor, ensuring it was well-maintained, cleaned, and ready for battle. This also included helping the knight put on his armor. The squire was also responsible for grooming and saddling the knight’s horses. Squires would accompany their knights into battle. Additionally, a squire would serve his lord by making his bed and waiting on him during meals. A lord with multiple squires would give each squire a specific role such as &quot;squire of the chamber&quot;.

A squire was typically a young boy, training to become a knight. A boy became a page at the age of 7, then a squire at age 14. Squires were the second step to becoming a knight, after having served as a page. Boys served a knight as an attendant, doing simple but important tasks such as saddling a horse or caring for the knight&#x27;s weapons and armour. Many squires were hired servants with no known pedigree.

While many squires were young men who would eventually become knights, others were of too low a rank to become a knight. These squires often still owned a manor. Some squires who were capable of becoming knights remained squires, resulting in two classes of landholding squires. A third class of squire were squires based on employment, their lord providing their military equipment. All three classes were official recognized by the tax law of 1379

<doc id="676595" wikidata="Q5408968" url="?curid=676595" title="Makki ki roti">
<text>Makki ki roti is a flat unleavened bread made from corn meal (maize flour). Like most rotis in the Indian subcontinent, it is baked on a &quot;tava&quot;.

It is primarily eaten in the Punjab region of India and Pakistan and in Jammu, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand in North India and Gujarat, Maharashtra in Western India and also in Nepal.

== Etymology ==
Literally, &quot;makkī kī roṭṭī&quot; means &#x27;flatbread of maize&#x27;. The word &quot;Makki&quot; is derived from Sanskrit &quot;Markaka&quot; and &quot;Roti&quot; from Sanskrit word &quot;Rotīka&quot;. &quot;Makki ki roti&quot; is yellow in color when ready, and has much less cohesive strength, which makes it difficult to handle.

==Mode of serving==

&quot;Makki ki Roti&quot; is eaten in many parts of India, but has been portrayed as a centuries-old part of Punjabi cuisine.

&quot;Makki ki roti&quot; is often served with warming winter dishes based on greens (&quot;saag&quot;), such as &quot;sarson ka saag&quot; and &quot;channa ka saag&quot;. In Punjab and neighbouring area it is also eaten with Maah (Urad) daal. Dogras have folk songs that mention Makki di roti. Maize food items are also popular in Rajasthan and one of that is maize roti. In fact, maize is one of the staple diet of Bishnois of Rajasthan and Haryana. In Uttar Pradesh, maize roti is also eaten with ghee, butter, jaggery and pickles. In Gujarat, this dish is also known as &quot;Makai No Rotlo&quot;.

<doc id="676596" wikidata="Q5272842" url="?curid=676596" title="Dick Douglas">
<text>Richard Giles Douglas (4 January 1932 – 3 May 2014) was a Scottish politician who was a Member of Parliament (MP) elected as a Labour Co-operative candidate, but who subsequently joined the Scottish National Party (SNP).

==Political career==
He first stood for Parliament at South Angus in the 1964 General Election, but was beaten by the Conservative Jock Bruce-Gardyne. Next he stood unsuccessfully for Edinburgh West in the 1966 General Election, against the Conservative incumbent Anthony Stodart.

In 1967 Douglas was a Labour councillor and the defeated candidate at a by-election in Glasgow Pollok. In the 1970 general election Douglas stood as the Labour and Co-operative candidate for Clackmannan and Eastern Stirlingshire and was elected to the House of Commons. He did not retain the seat in the February 1974 General Election, nor regain it in October 1974.

In the 1979 general election he stood as the Labour and Co-operative candidate for Dunfermline and was elected again. By the time of the 1983 General Election the constituency boundaries had been revised, so Douglas stood as the Labour and Co-operative candidate for the new Dunfermline West constituency. Douglas was elected, and won the constituency again in the 1987 General Election.

In 1990 Douglas defected from Labour to the SNP. He took this decision feeling the Labour Party was adopting too centrist a position on the political spectrum, and he was especially angry at the lack of direction in the Labour Party in their attitude to the Poll Tax. He favoured a non-payment campaign which Labour did not officially support, whilst the SNP had been quick to adopt such as policy. Douglas&#x27; defection took the number of SNP MPs from four to five through to the 1992 general election. At that election Douglas decided not to seek re-election in Dunfermline West, the seat he had represented for 13 years, but to stand against Donald Dewar (a then high-profile Scottish Labour MP) in his Glasgow Garscadden seat. He was unsuccessful, with Dewar winning his seat comfortably and Dunfermline West returning a Labour MP. Douglas did not return to front-line active politics, but remained a member of the SNP.

==Death==
Douglas died, aged 82, on 3 May 2014. Then Scottish first Minister, Alex Salmond paid tribute to Douglas saying he was an &quot;extraordinary politician&quot;.

<text>The Swabian League () was a military alliance of imperial estates – imperial cities, prelates, principalities and knights – principally in the territory of the early medieval stem duchy of Swabia established in 1488. New institutions created through imperial reform removed the need for the league, whilst the religious revolution of the Protestant Reformation divided its members, leading to the Swabian League being disbanded in 1534.

==History==
The Swabian League was established in 1488 at the behest of Emperor Frederick III and supported as well by Bertold, Elector of Mainz, whose conciliar rather than monarchic view of the &quot;Reich&quot; often put him at odds with Frederick&#x27;s successor Maximilian. The Swabian League cooperated towards the keeping of the imperial peace and at least in the beginning curbing the expansionist Bavarian dukes from the House of Wittelsbach and the revolutionary threat from the south in the form of the Swiss. The League held regular meetings, supported tribunals and maintained a unified force of 12,000 infantrymen and 1200 cavalry.

On 14 February 1488, a new Swabian League was formed, at the &quot;Reichstag&quot; of Esslingen, not only of 22 Imperial cities but also of the Swabian knights&#x27; League of St. George&#x27;s Shield, bishops, and princes (Ansbach, Baden, Bavaria, Bayreuth, Hesse, Mainz, the Electorate of the Palatinate, Trier, Tyrol, and Württemberg). The league was governed by a federal council of three colleges of princes, cities, and knights calling upon an army of 13,000 men. It aided in the rescue of the future emperor Maximilian I, son of Emperor Frederick III, held prisoner in the Low Countries, and later was his main support in southern Germany.

After the death of Eberhard of Württemberg in 1496 the League produced no single outstanding generally accepted leader, and with the peace of 1499 with the Swiss and the definitive defeat of the aggressive Wittelsbachs in 1504, the League&#x27;s original purpose, maintenance of the &quot;status quo&quot; in the southwest, was accomplished. Its last major action was the occupation and annexation of the Free City of Reutlingen by duke Ulrich of Württemberg in 1519 during the interregnum that followed the death of Maximilian I. The duke was overthrown, and his territory was sold to Charles V, offsetting the costs of the campaign.

The League defeated an alliance of robber barons in the Franconian War in 1523. Next it helped to suppress the Peasants&#x27; Revolt in 1524–26, including its defeat and execution of Little Jack (Jaecklein) Rohrbach, and crushing the Black Company in its last stand at the Battle of Ingolstadt in May 1525.

The development of imperial institutions, such as the creation of the Reichskammergericht imperial court in 1495 and the development of the Reichstag, led to the league becoming increasingly unnecessary. Imperial institutions were viewed as a better system of maintaining order due to their stronger constitutional backing and sanction by the emperor, and were more popular amongst the princes for being ordered more hierarchically than the Swabian league. The Habsburgs also favoured imperial institutions over the league as imperial institutions could cover the entire empire, and did not have to be continually renewed. Additionally, the religious revolution of the Protestant Reformation divided its members, finally leading to the Swabian League being disbanded in 1534.

== Members ==
* Sigismund of Habsburg, Count of Tyrol and Archduke of Further Austria, followed by Archduke Maximilian I of Habsburg in 1490

extended after 1500 by its former opponent:
* Albert IV of Wittelsbach, Duke of Bavaria-Munich, Duke of re-united Bavaria from 1503.
In 1512 Baden and Württemberg left the league, while the Prince-Bishops of Bamberg and Eichstätt were admitted, followed by
* Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse in 1519
* Louis V of Wittelsbach of the Electorate of the Palatinate, Prince-elector as well as

<text>Sylvia Jane Kirby (December 9, 1956), known mononymously as Sylvia, is an American country music and country pop singer and songwriter. Her biggest hit (a crossover chart topper), was her single &quot;Nobody&quot; in 1982. It reached number 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, number 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart, number 9 on the &quot;Cashbox&quot; Top 100, and number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country Singles chart. The song earned her a gold record certification and a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. Her other country chart hits include &quot;Drifter&quot; (number one in 1981), &quot;Fallin&#x27; in Love&quot;, &quot;Tumbleweed&quot; and &quot;Snapshot&quot;. She was named Female Vocalist of the Year by the Academy of Country Music for 1982. She is also credited with making the first &quot;concept&quot; music video clip to air on Country Music Television (CMT), with &quot;The Matador&quot;.

==Early life==
Sylvia was born in Kokomo, Indiana, United States. She began performing at age 3 when she was asked to sing at a small local church. Sylvia eventually relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, on December 26, 1975. Wishing to become a recording artist, Sylvia took a job as a secretary for producer and publisher Tom Collins, who produced records for both Barbara Mandrell and Ronnie Milsap.

== Career ==
After auditioning for Dave &amp; Sugar, Sylvia was signed as a solo artist by RCA Records in 1979. Her first RCA single was called &quot;You Don&#x27;t Miss a Thing&quot;. The song reached the Country Top 40. In 1980 she released another single, &quot;It Don&#x27;t Hurt to Dream&quot;. The record rose a little higher, to number 35. That same year, she finally made it to the Top 10 with &quot;Tumbleweed&quot;. In 1981, her song &quot;Drifter&quot; hit number 1 on the country charts, and two other songs, &quot;The Matador&quot; and &quot;Heart on the Mend&quot; landed in the Top 10. &quot;The Matador&quot; was country music&#x27;s first conceptual music video to air on CMT. &quot;Drifter&quot; was her 1981 RCA debut studio album, containing the hits &quot;Tumbleweed&quot; and &quot;Heart On The Mend&quot;.

===Chart hits in the 1980s===
In 1982, from her &quot;Just Sylvia&quot; studio album, Sylvia released the single &quot;Nobody&quot;, which reached number 1 on the country music chart, hit number 15 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100 chart, and sold more than a million copies. The song was also an Adult Contemporary hit, making the Top 5. &quot;Nobody&quot; became Sylvia&#x27;s signature song.

&quot;Nobody&quot; and the album &quot;Just Sylvia&quot; were certified gold in the United States and Canada. &quot;Nobody&quot; was the 1982 BMI Song of the Year, awarded for receiving more radio airplay than any other single that year. In 1982, Sylvia was the Academy of Country Music&#x27;s &quot;Female Vocalist of the Year&quot; and a Grammy nominee for &quot;Best Female Vocalist&quot;.

In 1983, Sylvia&#x27;s album &quot;Snapshot&quot; was released; its title song climbed to number 5 on the country chart and became her second-highest selling single. She had two other songs in the Top 20 that year, &quot;I Never Quite Got Back&quot; and &quot;The Boy Gets Around&quot;.

In 1985, Sylvia released &quot;One Step Closer&quot;, produced by Brent Maher, who brought a more guitar-driven feel. Three singles were released: &quot;Fallin&#x27; in Love&quot;, &quot;Cry Just a Little Bit&quot;, and &quot;I Love You By Heart.&quot; This was followed up by Sylvia&#x27;s last top 40 country hit, &quot;Nothin&#x27; Ventured, Nothin&#x27; Gained&quot;, from the unreleased album &quot;Knockin Around&quot;. The shelving of this album marked the end of Sylvia&#x27;s tenure with RCA Records. Sylvia recorded for RCA until the end of 1987, delivering 11 Top Ten songs, and selling more than four million records.

RCA put together a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilation and issued a new single titled &quot;Straight from My Heart&quot;, written with Jimmy Fortune of the Statler Brothers. With little promotion from RCA, the single charted in the low 60s.

===Later career===
When her contract with RCA ended, Sylvia took a break from touring and recording to focus on developing as a songwriter. In 1988 and 1989, she guest-hosted TNN&#x27;s &quot;Crook and Chase&quot; show and her own &quot;Holiday Gourmet&quot; cooking special.

Sylvia&#x27;s first independent album, &quot;The Real Story&quot;, was released in 1996 on her own label, Red Pony Records. In a May 1998 &quot;People&quot; magazine review, Ralph Novak wrote, &quot;Sylvia always sang with more intensity and resonance than most country singers... and she can still sing a story song better than almost anyone around.&quot;

In 2002, she followed with &quot;Where in the World&quot;, a set that marked the culmination of an 11-year musical collaboration with John Mock. Songwriter Craig Bickhardt contributed the song &quot;Crazy Nightingale&quot;. Bickhardt had previously performed with Sylvia from 1984, and wrote the title cut to &quot;One Step Closer&quot;. Also in 2002, Sylvia released, &quot;A Cradle in Bethlehem&quot;, her first Christmas album.

In 2016, the album, &quot;It&#x27;s All in the Family&quot;, was released on Red Pony Records.

In 2018, Sylvia released, &quot;Second Bloom: The Hits Re-Imagined&quot;, an album of some of her hits she re-recorded with a more acoustic yet fully produced approach.

<doc id="676623" wikidata="Q155425" url="?curid=676623" title="Friedrich von Flotow">
<text>Friedrich Adolf Ferdinand, Freiherr von Flotow (; 27 April 1812 – 24 January 1883) was a German composer. He is chiefly remembered for his opera &quot;Martha&quot;, which was popular in the 19th century and the early part of the 20th.

==Life==
Born in Teutendorf, in Mecklenburg, into an aristocratic family, Flotow was French-trained. Although he was intended for a diplomatic career, his father acceded to his wishes and he studied at the Conservatoire de Paris under Anton Reicha. During this time came under the influence of Auber, Rossini, Meyerbeer, Donizetti, Halévy, and later Gounod and Offenbach. These influences are reflected in his operas, where a distinctive French &quot;opéra comique&quot; flavour exists.

During the 1830 revolution he returned home, writing chamber music and operetta until it was safe to return to Paris. He completed his first opera in 1835, &quot;Pierre et Cathérine&quot;, but his breakthrough came with &quot;Le naufrage de la Méduse&quot; (1839), based on the wreck of the warship &quot;Méduse&quot;. The three-act romantic opera &quot;Alessandro Stradella&quot; of 1844 is recognized as one of Flotow&#x27;s finer works. &quot;Martha&quot; was first staged in Vienna at the Theater am Kärntnertor on 25 November 1847, and soon became one of the best-loved of all his operas.

In 1848 revolution again drove Flotow home. Between 1856 and 1863 he served as &quot;Intendant&quot; of the court theatre at Schwerin. From 1863 he lived in either Paris or Vienna, and he had the satisfaction of seeing his operas mounted as far away as Saint Petersburg and Turin. He died in Darmstadt.

==Works==

===Operas===
In all, Flotow wrote about 30 operas. Many of these works were performed in different versions and under different titles, in German, French and sometimes other languages. Some survive, some are lost. All but &quot;Martha&quot; have fallen into obscurity, and even &quot;Martha&quot; is not nearly as often performed now as it was a century ago, though it is still sometimes staged, and there have been a number of attempts to revive other Flotow works (including &quot;Alessandro Stradella&quot;) during recent years.

The best-known single piece by Flotow is probably &quot;Ach! so fromm, ach! so traut&quot;. It has been much recorded in its Italian version, &quot;M&#x27;apparì tutt&#x27;amor&quot;.

<doc id="676632" wikidata="Q384312" url="?curid=676632" title="John Lions">
<text>John Lions (19 January 1937 – 5 December 1998) was an Australian computer scientist. He is best known as the author of &quot;Lions&#x27; Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition, with Source Code&quot;, commonly known as the &quot;Lions Book&quot;.

==Early life==
Lions gained a degree with first-class honours from the University of Sydney in 1959. He applied, and received a scholarship to study at the University of Cambridge where he earned his doctorate on Control engineering in 1963. After his graduation, he worked at the consulting firm KCS Ltd in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. In 1967, he briefly took a position at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada before moving on to working for Burroughs in Los Angeles as a Systems Analyst.

==Later life==
In 1972 he moved back to Sydney, Australia and became a senior lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at the University of New South Wales (UNSW). In 1980, he was promoted to Associate Professor and apart from sabbaticals in 1978, 1983 and 1989 at Bell Laboratories, he remained at the school until retiring in 1995 due to bad health.

==Work==
* His most famous work, the Lions Book, was written as course notes for his operating systems course at UNSW.
* Lions organised the Australian UNIX Users&#x27; Group and was its founding president from 1984 to 1986.
* Lions was involved in the setting up of an annual conference for academics, the Australian Computer Science Conference and he was the editor of the Australian Computer Journal for six years and was made a fellow of the Australian Computer Society for his contribution.

==Personal life==
John Lions was married to Marianne and had two children, Katherine and Elizabeth.

==Contribution to UNSW==
This commentary is included in an unofficial history of UNSW&#x27;s Computer Science &amp; Engineering by Ken Robinson (computer scientist), their longest serving member of teaching staff.

===John Lions and UNIX===

Also in the early seventies, the groundbreaking creation of the UNIX operating system and the C programming language by Bell Laboratories researchers Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie inspired programmers globally including Lecturers Ken Robinson (on staff from 1972) and John Lions (on staff from 1973). In 1973, Ken Robinson recognised the UNIX OS as &quot;too good to be true&quot; and acquired a copy of the system from Bell Laboratories. John Lions took over the management of the installation of UNIX on the department&#x27;s PDP 11/40 computer and, recognising the importance of the accessibility of this system immediately incorporated a study of UNIX in his teaching, making significant modifications to two of his courses. In addition, he wrote the ‘Source Code and Commentary on Unix Level 6’ and handed cardboard bound copies on computer printout paper to his astonished students. Containing the entire UNIX 6 operating system, the book proved an invaluable teaching resource and a technical bible for a whole generation of professionals.

Legally, the book was only supposed to be available to licensees of UNIX 6 and by the time of the release of UNIX 7 in 1979, intellectual property laws were invoked to ban its publication. One programming student recalled, ‘because we couldn’t legally discuss the book in the university’s operating systems class, several of us would meet at night in an empty classroom to discuss the book. It was the only time in my life I was an active member of an underground.’ [Mr Peter Reintjes (BE ’xx) quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald, 11 December 1999].

In the early 1980s multiple copies of the Lion’s book were photocopied. (title) John Lions taught until 1991 and lived just long enough to see the ban on his book finally lifted in 1998. The importance of his work was recognised by the dedication on 26 June 2002 of the John Lions Garden outside the K17 building, with an annular placed around the largest tree bearing the inscription, ‘Lions’ books inspired a generation of operating systems designers.’ [UNSW Engineers, Issue 7, November 2002, p10.] At the same time, a Lions Chair in Computer Science was established, funded partly through the University, but largely through the tremendous efforts of former students who he motivated and inspired with his teaching and research and who acknowledge his defining influence on their professional lives.

UNSW had the first installation of UNIX in Australia, and was one of the first places to be using that system outside of the USA. The School of Computer Science and Engineering has continued to base a significant amount of its teaching on UNIX-like systems, nowadays Linux.

==Posthumous honours==

===John Lions Chair in Computer Science===
After his death, John O&#x27;Brien, Chris Maltby, Greg Rose and Steve Jenkin, former students of Lions, commenced a campaign to raise funds to create a chair in his name at UNSW, the John Lions Chair of Operating Systems. With donations from many UNSW alumni, corporations, Usenix, Linux Australia, the chair was created in 2006, becoming the first chair at UNSW funded by contributions from alumni. In 2009, Gernot Heiser became the inaugural John Lions Chair. Of the Usenix donations, US$6,000 came from the 1998 auction of the California UNIX license plate by Ted Dolotta, won by John Mashey, who had lent his copies of the Lions books (used in Bell Labs internal courses) and never gotten back. Lions had graciously replaced them with autographed copies on an earlier visit of Mashey to Sydney. They now are members of the collection at the Computer History Museum.

===John Lions Garden===
In 2002, UNSW dedicated the John Lions Garden in front of the new Computer Science and Engineering building to Lions&#x27; memory.

===John Lions Award for Contribution to Open Software===
In 2011, The School of Computer Science and Engineering at UNSW initiated the John Lions Award for Contribution to Open Software. The Prize is open to high school and undergraduate university students enrolled in an Australian secondary or tertiary institution. Full-time and part-time students are eligible, as well as local and internationals students. The annual prize is valued at $1,000.

<text>The Casspir is a Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle that has been in use in South Africa since the 1980s. It is a four-wheeled, four-wheel drive vehicle, used for transport of troops. It can hold a crew of two, plus 12 additional soldiers and associated equipment. The Casspir was unique in design when launched, providing for passive mine defence. The main armoured steel body of the vehicle is raised high above the ground, so when a mine is detonated, the explosion is less likely to damage the crew compartment and kill the occupants. The cross-section of the hull is V-shaped, directing the force of the explosion outwards, further protecting the occupants. 

The vehicle also offers crew protection from small arms fire. The capabilities of the Casspir were the basis of the outline capabilities required by the U.S. Marines for their MRAP program.

==Design history==
The name &#x27;Casspir&#x27; is an anagram of the abbreviations of the customer, the South African Police, and the design authority, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR – Applied Chemistry Unit that later became MECHEM). Although the Casspir was deployed in townships during the apartheid era, it was initially designed specifically for conditions encountered in the South African Border War. 

It was at first extensively used by the infamous &quot;Koevoet&quot; police counterinsurgency unit in northern Namibia during the apartheid era and later also by the South-West Africa Territorial Force&#x27;s 101 Battalion and the SA Army&#x27;s 5 Reconnaissance Regiment. The chief criteria for the design was good off-road mobility, armour protection against small arms fire and anti-personnel mines, and ease and speed of repair by a light workshop crew in the field after detonating an anti-tank mine. These requirements led to the distinctive V-shaped hull (for mine protection) and a wheeled chassis.

The Casspir was designed by the Defence Research Unit (DRU) of CSIR specifically to protect vehicle occupants against landmines. It is certified to protect its occupants against a triple TM-57 mine blast (equivalent to 21 kg of TNT) under a wheel, or a double blast (14 kg of TNT) under the hull. The Casspir has a V-bottomed armoured monocoque hull, designed to deflect the force of an explosion outwards, to which a leaf-spring suspension is attached.

==Production history==
After two years of field testing, the South African Police were eventually satisfied they had a good vehicle and in March 1980 placed an order for an initial 140 Casspirs. Some 190 Mk1 Casspirs were manufactured by Henred Fruehauf. In 1981 production was taken over by TFM, which improved the design to the Mk 2. TFM was subsequently taken over by Reumech OMC. Reumech in turn was taken over by Vickers Defence Systems of the UK and renamed Vickers OMC. When Alvis purchased Vickers Defence Systems to become Alvis Vickers, Vickers OMC became Alvis OMC. In 2004 BAE Systems acquired Alvis Vickers and Alvis OMC was renamed Land Systems OMC. Land Systems OMC was 75 per cent acquired by Denel in 2015. An estimated 2800 Casspirs of all types have been built. In 2018 the ADE 352 engines, gearboxes, shock absorbers, differentials and other parts are still being supplied by ADE (Atlantis Diesel Engineering) in South Africa as well as the later model Casspir NG2000.

The South African Police Service sold some of their surplus Casspirs to the public at a 2008 auction. A new Casspir known as &quot;Casspir NG 2000&quot; is being manufactured by Denel Mechem. The vehicle was launched in April 2013.

==Variants==


* Casspir Mk 1. It made extensive use of Mercedes-Benz truck components. First use in combat: Koevoet, South West African Police
* Casspir Mk 2 First user: 101 Battalion, South West African Territorial Force
* Casspir Mk 2C (I)
* Casspir Mk 3 – 170 hp (127 kW) ADE-352T 6-cylinder turbo-diesel
* Casspir 2000 &amp; NG2000A (Mercedes Benz based)
* Casspir 2000B (Powerstar – North Benz based)
* Casspir 2000C (SINO Truck Military based)

The Casspir was built in different configurations:
* APC – armoured personnel carrier
* Artillery Fire Control vehicle
* Ambulance
* Blesbok Freighter – with drop side cargo area for up to 5 tons (160 built). Can be used as a weapon platform.
* Duiker Tanker – 5000 litre tank (30 built); originally with 3000 litre tank
* FISTV – Fire Support Team vehicle
* Gemsbok Recovery vehicle – 15-ton capacity (30 built)
* Mechem Mine clearing vehicle – uses steel wheels to detonate mines
* MEDDS (Mechem Explosives and Drug Detection System) Mine Sensor vehicle
* Mechem VAMMIDS (Vehicular Array Mine Detection System) Vehicle
* Plofadder Mine clearing System – carrier of the containerised Plofadder 160AT rocket-propelled mine clearing system
* Riot Control vehicle – Police version with larger windows to increase visibility
* Mechem LP (Low-Profile) and short-wheelbase vehicle
* Casspir Dumpy – A shortened version (1 m shorter) developed and purchased by the SA Army in 1982 to be evaluated against the requirements for the Buffel replacement project. Did not enter production
* Sesspir – In 1984–85 the CSIR developed a prototype Casspir with six wheels. An additional non-driven axle was fitted in front of the front drive axle, this to be sacrificed in the event of a landmine detonation. It steered along with the regular driven front wheels and was equipped with winch cables to hoist either side of the axle clear off the ground in the event of the loss of a wheel. The theory being the vehicle would remain mobile. The idea was shelved as one of numerous problems was simply a lack of power from the engine to push the undriven axle along through bush and soft sand. Only one prototype was built.
* Casspir NG Series or Casspir 2000 is known as the new generation hence Casspir NG 2000. Available in various models 2000, 2000A; 2000B; 2000C and a possible D model, all to house various drive trains. The NG design allow a common hull to fit various drive trains and either manual or automatic drive.

==Popular culture==
The Casspir has entered South African popular culture as an icon of apartheid-era state repression and is controversial for its continued deployment in South Africa for policing tasks. A beadwork Casspir, with Ndebele designs, outside the Iziko South African National Gallery was installed as a representation of this iconography of the vehicle. Created by interdisciplinary contemporary artist Ralph Ziman, the artwork is titled &quot;The Casspir Project&quot;.

A Casspir also forms part of the South Africa Apartheid Museum&#x27;s exhibit on repression in the townships in the 1980s. 

Casspirs were extensively used by the human characters to enter into the alien settlement zone in the 2009 movie &quot;District 9&quot;.

A Casspir is seen in the music video for the song &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; by Gorillaz.

<doc id="676634" wikidata="Q755973" url="?curid=676634" title="Interahamwe">
<text>The Interahamwe ( or ) is a Hutu paramilitary organization active in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda. The Interahamwe was formed around 1990, as the youth wing of the National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (MRND according to its French name), the then-ruling party of Rwanda, and enjoyed the backing of the Hutu Power government. The Interahamwe, led by Robert Kajuga, were the main perpetrators of the Rwandan genocide, during which an estimated 500,000 to 1,000,000 Tutsi, Twa, and moderate Hutus were killed from April to July 1994, and the term &quot;Interahamwe&quot; was widened to mean any civilian militias or bands killing Tutsi.

The Interahamwe were driven out of Rwanda after Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) victory in the Rwandan Civil War in July 1994, and are considered a terrorist organization by many African and Western governments. The Interahamwe and splinter groups such as the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) continue to wage an insurgency against Rwanda from neighboring countries, where they are also involved in local conflicts and terrorism.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Interahamwe&quot; can be translated as &quot;those who work together&quot; or loosely as &quot;those who fight together&quot; in Kinyarwanda. &quot;Work&quot;, in racist radio broadcasts during the genocide, was used as slang that meant using machetes to kill. The name &quot;&quot; can be broken up as follows: &quot;&quot; is derived from the verb &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;to work&quot;; &quot;&quot; means &quot;together&quot; and is related to the word &quot;&quot; for &quot;one&quot;.

English speakers usually pronounce it as , though it is pronounced in Kinyarwanda. However, when speaking English, Rwandans will sometimes pronounce it in an English manner. The difference can be observed by listening to Paul Rusesabagina in the &quot;Return to Rwanda&quot; feature of a &quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot; DVD, and to the translator for a survivor of the Nyarubuye massacre in &quot;&quot;Frontline&quot; Ghosts of Rwanda&quot;.

==Organization and history==
Robert Kajuga, a half Tutsi (unusual for this group), was the president of the Interahamwe. The vice president of Interahamwe was Georges Rutaganda. The Interahamwe was formed from groups of young people of the MRND party. They carried out the Rwandan genocide against the Tutsis in 1994.

The radio station RTLM, founded by Rwandan president Juvénal Habyarimana and his wife, was popular amongst the Interahamwe for its decidedly pro-Hutu agenda, among other things. From October 1993 to late 1994, it was used as an outlet for extremists to release ethnocentric and xenophobic propaganda targeted at the Tutsis, moderate Hutus and Belgians. Often it encouraged the ongoing acts of genocide by promoting fear among the Hutus that the Tutsis would massacre them, and broadcasting the positions of Tutsis hiding or attempting to flee.

Following the invasion of the Rwandan capital Kigali by the Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), many Rwandan civilians and members of the Interahamwe fled to neighbouring countries, most notably to what at the time was Zaire, now Democratic Republic of Congo, and Tanzania. Sudan welcomed former Interahamwe to Juba, and in March 1998, Colonel Tharcisse Renzaho, the former prefect of Kigali, and Colonel Aloys Ntiwiragabo, the former Rwandan Presidential Guard commander, arrived in Juba from Nairobi to organize them. It has been nearly impossible to bring the Interahamwe to justice because they did not wear uniforms or have a clearly organized group of followers. They were the neighbours, friends and co-workers of Tutsis. Throughout the war, members of the Interahamwe moved into camps of refugees and the internally displaced. There the victims were mixed in with the enemy making it difficult to prosecute members of the Interahamwe. But the Gacaca court was put in place to at least attempt to get the killers in jail. It has seen criticism from many different sources for being flawed with the judges having inadequate training and many different parties in the court system being corrupt. This problem has led to many innocent people being put in jail and has caused the prisons to become overcrowded.

During the war, millions of Rwandan Hutu refugees fled to Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), along with many members of the Interahamwe, Presidential Guard and the Rwandan Government Forces (RGF). Following the recruitment of significant numbers of Congolese Hutu the organisation took the name Armée de Libération du Rwanda (ALiR). With the Kagame regime still in power, members still take part in border raids from the refugee camps.

==After the Rwandan genocide==
In 1999, Interahamwe attacked and kidnapped a group of 14 tourists in Bwindi National Park, Uganda. Eight of the tourists were killed. The story was featured on National Geographic, &quot;Locked Up Abroad: Uganda&quot;.

==Prosecution==
Leaders of the Interahamwe have been primarily prosecuted through the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha, Tanzania. The tribunal has convicted at least 41 persons, often with life sentences, including former interim Prime Minister Jean Kambanda and Georges Rutaganda. Fugitives have been captured and prosecuted in other countries, including Jean-Marie Vianney Mudahinyuka (a.k.a. &quot;Zuzu&quot;), an Interahamwe leader found hiding in Chicago, Illinois in January 2011.

<text>The Dark Sides is a compilation of King Diamond songs, released on 1 November 1988 through Roadrunner Records. This album contains five tracks (and an outro), released on previous albums, but are mostly unrelated in their stories (as King&#x27;s albums were concept albums).

==Controversy==
The album cover featured King Diamond with face paint that resembled KISS bassist Gene Simmons&#x27; &quot;Demon&quot;. Simmons claimed that King&#x27;s face paint was copyright infringement and sued him. The lawsuit was eventually dropped when King changed his design.

<text>Chris Y. Tilley (19552024) was a British archaeologist known for his contributions to post-processual archaeological theory. He retired as emeritus Professor of Anthropology and Archaeology at University College London in 2022.

Tilley obtained his PhD in Anthropology and Archaeology at the University of Cambridge, where he was a student of Ian Hodder. In the early 1980s, Hodder and his students at Cambridge first developed postprocessualism, an approach to archaeology stressing the importance of interpretation and subjectivity, strongly influenced by the Neo-Marxist Frankfurt School. Tilley and his early collaborator Daniel Miller were amongst the most strongly relativist of first wave postprocessualist archaeologists, and was particularly critical of what he saw as the negative political implications of positivist processual archaeology. In the late 1980s and 1990s, Tilley moved away from the structuralist approach pursued by Hodder and, along with Michael Shanks and Peter Ucko, advocated a position of strong relativism. For Shanks and Tilley, academic interpretations of the archaeological record have no more legitimacy than any other, and they view claims to the contrary as elitist attempts to control the past, asserting that &quot;there is no way of choosing between alternative pasts except on essentially political grounds.&quot;

In a 1989 paper of his published in the academic journal &quot;Antiquity&quot;, Tilley openly criticised the aims of rescue excavation, arguing that it was simply designed to collect &quot;more and more information about the past&quot;, most of which would remain unpublished and of no use to either archaeologists or the public. As he related, &quot;The number of pieces of information we collect about the past may increase incrementally – our understanding does not.&quot; Instead he argued that the archaeological community in the western nations should cease their constant accumulation of new data from rescue digs and instead focus on producing interpretive frameworks with which to interpret it, and also on publishing the backlog of data produced from decades of excavation.

Tilley is credited with introducing phenomenology into archaeology with his 1994 work &quot;A Phenomenology of Landscape&quot;. Phenomenology in archaeology entails the &#x27;intuitive&#x27; study of material things, especially landscapes, in terms of their meanings to people in the past, and has been influential in both Britain and the United States. In the late 1990s, Tilley worked with Barbara Bender and Sue Hamilton to investigate the Bronze Age landscapes of Leskernick on Bodmin Moor, with a number of UCL students.

<doc id="676646" wikidata="Q219831" url="?curid=676646" title="The Night Watch">
<text>Militia Company of District II under the Command of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq, also known as The Shooting Company of Frans Banning Cocq and Willem van Ruytenburch, but commonly referred to as The Night Watch (), is a 1642 painting by Rembrandt van Rijn. It is in the collection of the Amsterdam Museum but is prominently displayed in the Rijksmuseum as the best-known painting in its collection. &quot;The Night Watch&quot; is one of the most famous Dutch Golden Age paintings. Rembrandt&#x27;s large painting () is famed for transforming a group portrait of a civic guard company into a compelling drama energized by light and shadow (tenebrism). The title is a misnomer; the painting does not depict a nocturnal scene.

&quot;The Night Watch&quot; was completed in 1642 at the peak of the Dutch Golden Age. It depicts the eponymous company moving out, led by Captain Frans Banninck Cocq (dressed in black, with a red sash) and his lieutenant, Willem van Ruytenburch (dressed in yellow, with a white sash). Behind them, the company&#x27;s colors are carried by the ensign, Jan Visscher Cornelissen. Rembrandt incorporated the traditional emblem of the arquebusiers in the figure of the young girl who carries a dead chicken on her belt, referencing the &quot;clauweniers&quot; (arquebusiers) and a type of drinking horn used at group banquets.

==History==
===Commission===

The painting was commissioned around 1639 by Captain Banninck Cocq and seventeen members of his &quot;Kloveniers&quot; (civic militia guards). Eighteen names appear on a shield, painted circa 1715, in the center-right background, as the hired drummer was added to the painting for free. A total of 34 characters appear in the painting. Rembrandt was paid 1,600 guilders for the painting (each person paid one hundred), a large sum at the time. This was one of a series of seven similar paintings of the militiamen () commissioned during that time from various artists.

The painting was commissioned to hang in the banquet hall of the newly built Kloveniersdoelen (Musketeers&#x27; Meeting Hall) in Amsterdam. Some have suggested that the occasion for Rembrandt&#x27;s commission and the series of other commissions given to other artists was the visit of the French queen, Marie de&#x27; Medici, in 1638. Even though she was escaping from her exile from France ordered by her son Louis XIII, the queen&#x27;s arrival was met with great pageantry.

It is thought the painting was completed in a lean-to in Rembrandt&#x27;s garden as it is too large to fit into his Amsterdam studio.

===Location and alterations===

&quot;The Night Watch&quot; first hung in the (Great Hall) of Amsterdam&#x27;s . This structure currently houses the Doelen Hotel. In 1715, the painting was moved to the Amsterdam Town Hall, for which it was trimmed on all four sides. This was done, presumably, to fit the painting between two columns and was a common practice before the 19th century. This alteration resulted in the loss of two characters on the left side of the painting, the top of the arch, the balustrade, and the edge of the step. The missing portions have not been found; Taco Dibbits, director of the Rijksmuseum, has some hope that possibly at least the left-hand side might not have been destroyed as it contained three figures, and at the time the painting was trimmed Rembrandt paintings were already expensive.

A 17th-century copy of the painting by Gerrit Lundens (1622–1683), on loan from the National Gallery, London, to the Rijksmuseum, shows the original composition.

When Napoleon occupied the Netherlands, the Town Hall became the Palace on the Dam and the magistrates moved the painting to the of the family Trip. Napoleon ordered it returned, but after the occupation ended in 1813, the painting again moved to the , which now housed the Dutch Academy of Sciences. It remained there until it moved to the new when its building was finished in 1885.

The painting was removed from the Rijksmuseum in September 1939, at the onset of World War II. The canvas was detached from its frame and rolled around a cylinder. The rolled painting was stored for four years in a special safe that was built to protect many works of art in the caves of Maastricht, Netherlands. After the end of the war, the canvas was re-mounted, restored, and returned to the Rijksmuseum.

On 11 December 2003, &quot;The Night Watch&quot; was moved to a temporary location, due to a major refurbishment of the Rijksmuseum. The painting was detached from its frame, wrapped in stain-free paper, put into a wooden frame which was put into two sleeves, driven on a cart to its new destination, hoisted, and brought into its new home through a special slit.

While the refurbishment took place, &quot;The Night Watch&quot; could be viewed in its temporary location in the of the Rijksmuseum. When the refurbishment was finished in April 2013, the painting was returned to its original place in the (&quot;Room of the Night Watch&quot;).

In 2021, the painting was exhibited from June to September with the trimmed-off sections recreated using convolutional neural networks, an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm, based on the copy by Lundens. The recreation corrected for perspective (Lundens must have been sitting on the left side of the painting when he made his copy), and used colors and brush-strokes as used by Rembrandt. The trimming of the painting put the lieutenants in the center, but the original placed them off-center, marching towards an empty space now reinstated, creating a dynamic of the troops marching towards the left of the painting. The cutdown painting by Rembrandt with the AI recreation of the missing portions attached was placed on exhibition for three months. The augmented painting will not be on permanent display so as not to &quot;trick&quot; viewers into thinking they were seeing the full original; the augmentations are a scientific, rather than an artist&#x27;s, interpretation.

===Vandalism and restoration===

For much of its existence, the painting was coated with a dark varnish, which gave the incorrect impression that it depicted a night scene, leading to the name by which it is now commonly known. On 13 January 1911, a jobless shoemaker and former Navy chef attempted to slash the painting with a shoemaker&#x27;s knife protesting his inability to find work. However, the thick coating of varnish protected the painting from any damage at that time. The varnish was removed only in the 1940s.

On 14 September 1975, the work was attacked with a bread knife by an unemployed school teacher, Wilhelmus de Rijk, resulting in several large zig-zagged slashes up to 30 cm long. De Rijk, who suffered from mental illness, claimed he &quot;did it for the Lord&quot; and that he &quot;was ordered to do it&quot;. The painting was successfully restored after four years, but some evidence of the damage is still visible up close. De Rijk died by suicide in April 1976, before he could have been charged.

On 6 April 1990, an escaped psychiatric patient sprayed acid onto the painting with a concealed pump bottle. Security guards intervened, stopping the man and quickly spraying water onto the canvas. Ultimately, the acid only penetrated the varnish layer of the painting, and it was fully restored.

In July 2019, a long and complex restoration effort began. The restoration took place in public, in a specially made glass enclosure built and placed in the Rijksmuseum and was livestreamed. The plan was to move the 337 kg painting into the enclosure starting when the museum closed for the day on 9 July, then to map the painting &quot;layer by layer and pigment by pigment&quot;, and plan conservation work according to what was found. Taco Dibbits, the Rijksmuseum&#x27;s general director, said that despite working there for 17 years, he had never seen the top of the painting; &quot;We know so little on how [Rembrandt] worked on making &quot;The Night Watch&quot;.&quot;

===New LED illumination===
On 26 October 2011, the Rijksmuseum unveiled new, sustainable LED lighting for &quot;The Night Watch&quot;. With new technology, it is the first time LED lighting has been able to render the fine nuances of the painting&#x27;s complex color palette.

The new illumination uses LED lights with a color temperature of 3,200 kelvin, similar to warm-white light sources such as tungsten halogen. It has a color rendering index of over 90, which makes it suitable for the illumination of artifacts such as &quot;The Night Watch&quot;. Using the new LED lighting, the museum saves 80% on energy and offers the painting a safer environment because of the absence of UV radiation and heat.

===Gigapixel photograph===
On 13 May 2020, the Rijksmuseum published a 44.8 gigapixel image of &quot;The Night Watch&quot; made from 528 different still photographs. &quot;The 24 rows of 22 pictures were stitched together digitally with the aid of neural networks&quot;, the museum said. It was primarily created for scientists to view the painting remotely, and to track how ageing affects the painting. The photograph can be viewed online and zoomed into to see fine detail.

== Cultural legacy ==
* Maurice Merleau-Ponty refers to this work in his 1961 essay &quot;Eye and Mind&quot;. He writes that &quot;[t]he spatiality of the captain lies at the meeting of two lines of sight that are incompossible with one another. Everyone with eyes has at some time or other witnessed this play of shadows, or something like it, and has been made by it to see a space and the things included therein.&quot;
* The work has inspired musical works in both the classical and rock traditions, including the second movement of Gustav Mahler&#x27;s 7th Symphony and Ayreon&#x27;s &quot;The Shooting Company of Captain Frans B. Cocq&quot; from &quot;Universal Migrator Part 1: The Dream Sequencer&quot;. In King Crimson&#x27;s song &quot;The Night Watch&quot;, from the band&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot;, lyricist Richard Palmer-James muses on the painting to capture a key period in Dutch history, when, after a long period of &quot;Spanish Wars&quot;, the merchants and other members of the bourgeoisie can turn their lives inward and focus on the tangible results of their lives’ efforts. The song adopts a number of perspectives, including the primary subjects, the artist himself, and a modern viewer of the painting, and paints a portrait of the emergence of the modern upper-middle class and the consumerist culture.
* Alexander Korda&#x27;s 1936 biographical film &quot;Rembrandt&quot; depicts the painting, shown in error in its truncated form, as a failure at its completion, perceived as lampooning its outraged subjects.
* In Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s 1982 film &quot;Passion&quot;, &quot;The Night Watch&quot; is re-enacted with live actors in an opening shot. Godard explicitly compares his film to Rembrandt&#x27;s painting, describing them both as &quot;full of holes and badly-filled spaces&quot;. He instructs the viewer not to focus on the overall composition, but to approach his film as one would a Rembrandt and &quot;focus on the faces&quot;.
* &quot;The Night Watch&quot; is a major plot device in the eponymous 1995 film, &quot;Night Watch&quot;, which focuses on the painting&#x27;s theft.
* &quot;The Night Watch&quot; is parodied on the British cover of Terry Pratchett&#x27;s 2002 book by the same name. The cover illustrator, Paul Kidby, pays tribute to his predecessor Josh Kirby by placing him in the picture, in the position where Rembrandt is said to have painted himself. A copy of the original painting appears on the back cover of the book.
* &quot;The Night Watch&quot; is the subject of a 2007 film by director Peter Greenaway called &quot;Nightwatching&quot;, in which the film posits a conspiracy within the musketeer regiment of Frans Banning Cocq and Willem van Ruytenburch, and suggests that Rembrandt may have immortalized a conspiracy theory using subtle allegory in his group portrait of the regiment, subverting what was to have been a highly prestigious commission for both painter and subject. His 2008 film &quot;Rembrandt&#x27;s J&#x27;Accuse&quot; is a sequel or follow-on, and covers the same idea, using extremely detailed analysis of the compositional elements in the painting; in this Greenaway describes &quot;The Night Watch&quot; as (currently) the fourth most famous painting in the Western world, after the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, &quot;The Last Supper&quot; and the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.
* In 2006. &quot;The Night Watch&quot; inspired the literary work &quot;A Ronda da Noite&quot; by the famous Portuguese writer Agustina Bessa Luís.
* On &quot;The Amazing Race 21&quot;, a task in Amsterdam had teams re-create &quot;The Night Watch&quot; using live actors.
* The painting appears in episode 3 of season 2 of Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Sense8&quot;.
* The painting appeared in episode 5 of the acclaimed 2016 South Korean television series &quot;&quot; as part of an art collection of the character Goblin / Kim Shin (Gong Yoo).
* The painting appeared in the 2022 videogame &quot;Horizon Forbidden West&quot; by Guerrilla Games in the art vault of Tilda van der Meer.

===Other representations===

* Russian artist Alexander Taratynov created a bronze-cast representation of the famous painting that was displayed in Amsterdam&#x27;s Rembrandtplein from 2006 to 2009. After displays in other locations, the sculptures returned in 2012 and are now permanently installed in front of Louis Royer&#x27;s 1852 cast iron statue of Rembrandt.
* The only full-sized replica in the Western world is displayed by the Canajoharie Library &amp; Art Gallery, in Canajoharie, New York, donated to the library in the early 20th century by the library&#x27;s founder, Bartlett Arkell.
* The Rijksmuseum&#x27;s flashmob &#x27;Our Heroes are Back&#x27; recreated &quot;The Night Watch&quot; in an unsuspecting shopping mall in Breda, Netherlands – published on 1 April 2013 on YouTube.
* &quot;The Night Watch&quot; is also replicated in Delft blue at Royal Delft in the Netherlands. This version consists of 480 tiles. Two painters of the manufacture worked simultaneously from the left and right end of the frame, and they met at the center to complete the grand piece. After finishing, both painters recognized that they had a more difficult job as they only used black, to paint &quot;The Night Watch&quot;. They used the traditional cobalt oxide color adding water to make the lighter shades. Once it was fired at 1,200 degrees Celsius, the black material turns into blue. It seems that this version of &quot;The Night Watch&quot;, was bought by an unknown buyer and then given to the museum on loan to display to the public.
* In 2007, Austrian artist Matthias Laurenz Gräff, a distant descendant of Banninck Cocq and the De Graeff family, used Rembrandt&#x27;s Night Watch painting of Frans Banninck Cocq in his painting &quot;Ahnenfolge&quot; (Ancestral Succession/Ancestry) as part of his diploma series and thesis &quot;Weltaußenschau-Weltinnenschau&quot;.

<text>Night Watch is a fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett, the 29th book in his &quot;Discworld&quot; series, and the sixth starring the City Watch, published in 2002. The protagonist of the novel is Sir Samuel Vimes, commander of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch. A five-part radio adaptation of the novel was broadcast on BBC Radio 4. &quot;Night Watch&quot; placed second in the annual Locus Poll for best fantasy novel. In late 2024 Penguin announced that &quot;Night Watch&quot; would be added to the Penguin Modern Classics range, with a new introduction by Pratchett&#x27;s PA and friend Rob Wilkins, and annotations by Prof David Lloyd and Dr Darryl Jones.

==Plot summary==
On the morning of the 30th anniversary of the Glorious Revolution of the Twenty-Fifth of May (and as such the anniversary of the death of John Keel, Vimes&#x27; hero and former mentor), Sam Vimes — whose wife is in labour with their first child — is caught in a lightning storm while pursuing Carcer, a notorious criminal who has murdered several watchmen, to the roof of the Unseen University&#x27;s Library. He awakens to find that he has somehow been sent back in time.

Vimes&#x27;s first idea is to ask the wizards at the Unseen University to send him home, but before he can act on this, he is arrested for breaking curfew by a younger version of himself. Incarcerated in a cell next to his is Carcer, who after being released joins the Cable Street Particulars (otherwise known as the Unmentionables), the secret police carrying out the paranoid whims of the Patrician of the time, Homicidal Lord Winder.

When he is taken to be interrogated by the captain, time is frozen by Lu-Tze, who tells Vimes what has happened and that he must assume the identity of Sergeant-At-Arms John Keel, who was to have arrived that day but was murdered by Carcer. It is stated that the event which caused Vimes and Carcer to be sent into the past was a major temporal shattering. Vimes then returns to the office, time restarts and he convinces the captain that he is Keel.

Young Vimes believes Vimes to be Keel, allowing Vimes to teach Young Vimes the lessons for which Vimes idolized Keel. The novel climaxes in the Revolution. Vimes, taking command of the watchmen, successfully avoids the major bloodshed erupting all over the city and manages to keep his part of it relatively peaceful. After dealing with the Unmentionables&#x27; headquarters he has his haphazard forces barricade a few streets to keep people safe from the fighting between rebels and soldiers. However, the barricades are gradually pushed forward during the night (by Fred Colon and several other simple-minded watchmen) to encompass the surrounding streets until Vimes finds himself in control of a quarter of the city containing most of its food supplies, dubbed &quot;The Glorious People&#x27;s Republic of Treacle Mine Road&quot;, with a still alive Reg Shoe as one of the leading figures.

The ruler, Lord Winder, is effectively assassinated by the young Assassin&#x27;s Guild student Havelock Vetinari, and the new Patrician Lord Snapcase calls for a complete amnesty. However, he sees Keel as a threat and sends Carcer to lead a death squad of Unmentionables, watchmen and the palace guard to murder Keel. Several policemen (the ones who died when the barricade fell in the original timeline) are killed in the battle, as is Reg Shoe; Vimes manages to fight off the attack until he can grab Carcer, at which point they are returned to the future and Keel&#x27;s body is placed in the timeline Vimes has just left, to tie things up, as in the &quot;real&quot; history, Keel died in that fight.

Vimes&#x27; son is born, with the help of Doctor &quot;Mossy&quot; Lawn, whom Vimes met while in the past, and Vimes finally arrests Carcer, promising him a fair trial before he is hanged. A subsequent conversation with Lord Vetinari reveals that the Patrician alone knows Vimes took Keel&#x27;s place, also that he fought alongside Keel&#x27;s men against Carcer&#x27;s death squad. He proposes that the old Watch House at Treacle Mine Road (where Keel was sergeant, and which was destroyed by the dragon in &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot;) be rebuilt, as Vimes outright refuses a monument commemorating the Twenty-Fifth of May.

==Background and publication==
&quot;Night Watch&quot; is the twenty-ninth novel in the comic fantasy &quot;Discworld&quot; series, written by Terry Pratchett, and the sixth to focus on the character of Sam Vimes. Pratchett felt the book was closer to &quot;Discworld&quot; novels like &quot;The Fifth Elephant&quot; more so than the first book, &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot;, believing the series had &quot;evolved&quot;, attributing the series&#x27; success to its ability to change. Pratchett called the humour in the book &quot;the humour that comes out of bad situations&quot;, comparing it to the humour of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. The contents of the book, such as the secret police and the torture chamber, meant that an abundance of gags would seem wrong.

Pratchett commented:
:&quot;The point was, if I had filled the torture chamber with the comfy chair and soft cushions from Monty Python&#x27;s Spanish Inquisition sketch for a laugh, that would have been an obscenity.&quot;
Paul Kidby illustrated the cover of British edition, with &quot;Night Watch&quot; being the first main-sequence &quot;Discworld&quot; novel not to have a cover by the recently deceased Josh Kirby. Kidby had previously worked on &quot;Discworld&quot; in &quot;The Last Hero&quot;, &quot;The Pratchett Portfolio&quot; and &quot;Nanny Ogg&#x27;s Cookbook&quot;, establishing &quot;[his] own &#x27;look for the series. Kidby chose to parody Rembrandt&#x27;s painting &quot;Night Watch&quot;, an idea he&#x27;d had since first reading &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot;, and talked with Pratchett about what characters to include. Kidby pays tribute to the late artist by placing him in the picture, in the position where Rembrandt is said to have painted himself. At the time, Kidby recalls being criticised for making the cover &quot;too brown&quot;.

==Reception==
The book received critical acclaim. In the March/April 2003 issue of &quot;Bookmarks&quot;, the book received a (4.5 out of 5) with the critical summary stating, &quot;So Pratchett&#x27;s a satirist and a deep thinker, but that&#x27;s not all. He&#x27;s also a skilled storyteller, creative in his range of characters, plots, and dialogue. Finally, there&#x27;s his unpredictability: &#x27;anyone expecting T. Pratchett to stick to formula doesn&#x27;t know T. Pratchett&#x27; (Philadelphia Inquirer). If there&#x27;s one complaint, it&#x27;s the in-jokes—Night Watch assumes some previous Discoworld &quot;[sic]&quot; knowledge.&quot;

Robert Hanks of &quot;The Independent&quot; drew attention to a &quot;slight softening of the funny bone&quot; and a &quot;hardening of the issues&quot; in the later &quot;Discworld&quot; books, commenting on a lesser amount of jokes per page in &quot;Night Watch&quot;. He criticised the book&#x27;s slow start, but called the book intriguing for its &quot;Chestertonian common-sense morality&quot; and drew comparison to the book&#x27;s events to the Bloody Sunday. &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s Therese Littleton praised the book as &quot;transcend[ing] standard genre fare with its sheer schoolboy humour and characters who reject their own stereotypes&quot;.

&quot;Night Watch&quot; won the 2003 Prometheus Award, and came runner-up in the Locus Poll for best fantasy novel. On the suggestion of the book having &quot;darker&quot; themes, Pratchett responded:
==Adaptation==
A five-part radio adaptation of the novel was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 from February 27, 2008 that featured Philip Jackson as Sam Vimes and Carl Prekopp as young Sam.

He then began work at the GPO in July 1969, and as part of his work training had further education at Langside College for periods between 1969 and 1985, and at Stow College between 1971 and 1987. He left school and started work for the GPO (P.O., then British Telecom, then BT) on 14 July 1969 as a TTA (Trainee Technician Apprentice), and three years later became a Technician 2A when his initial apprenticeship ended. Robertson then trained for a further two years and became a Technical Officer. In December 1991, he was promoted to management where he stayed until he was given Voluntary Release in September 2000.

== Parliamentary career ==
Robertson joined the Labour Party in 1984, and was first elected to parliament in 2000 at a by-election on 23 November following the death of Donald Dewar, the First Minister of Scotland. He was re-elected at the 2001 election, and after constituency boundaries were redrawn for the 2005 election, he was returned for the larger constituency of Glasgow North West.

Robertson rebelled against his party&#x27;s Government on three occasions, most notably on a rebel Amendment vote (Division No. 117) prior to the main Declaration of War – Iraq vote (Division No.118). This Amendment said: This House &quot;believes that the case for war against Iraq has not yet been established, especially given the absence of specific United Nations authorisation; but, in the event that hostilities do commence, pledges its total support for the British forces&quot;. However, just 45 minutes later he backed the Government on the main vote authorising &quot;all means necessary to ensure the disarmament of Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction&quot;, in effect supporting the 2003 Iraq war. He later referred to these events in his September 2013 newsletter published online, in which claimed that he was &quot;one of the &#x27;rebels&#x27; who voted against the Iraq War in 2003.&quot; During the campaign for the 2015 general election, he participated in a hustings meeting in the Drumchapel district of his Glasgow North West constituency. In response to a question from a member of the public, he repeatedly denied that he had voted for the Iraq War. The SNP candidate, Carol Monaghan, again asserted that Robertson had voted for the Iraq War, to which he responded &quot;not true&quot;. These denials led to heated arguments with members of the public who accused him of being a liar. Robertson was defeated by Monaghan at the subsequent election.

The other occasions on which he rebelled against his party were on the declassification of cannabis from a class B to class C drug, something which he has subsequently spoken out on, and over the increase of the number of MSPs at the Scottish Parliament during the Scotland Parliament Bill.

He was Chair All Party Parliamentary Nuclear Energy Group and Chair of the all-party parliamentary group on Communications (apComms) and a member of the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee and the Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Nuclear Energy Group, Chair of All Party Parliamentary Music Groups, Chair All Party Parliamentary Group on Nigeria and Angola.

In November 2008, Robertson was one of 18 MPs who signed a Commons motion backing a Team GB football team at the 2012 Olympics, saying football &quot;should not be any different from other competing sports and our young talent should be allowed to show their skills on the world stage&quot;. The football governing bodies of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are all opposed to a Great Britain team, fearing it would stop them competing as individual nations in future tournaments.

He is a &quot;strong advocate for the place of nuclear power as part of a balanced energy mix in the UK&quot;, saying that it provides &quot;not only the cheapest low-carbon energy and therefore a significant opportunity to meet carbon emissions targets, but also with much greater energy security&quot;.

===Alternative medicine===
He is a supporter of homeopathy, having signed an early day motion in support of its continued funding on the National Health Service sponsored by Conservative MP David Tredinnick.

== Legislation ==
Robertson managed to change the law for blind people when he managed to get the Government to accept the amendment he tabled to the Welfare Reform Bill. It changed the rules from 1992 which restricted the higher rate of mobility allowance to people who were physically unable to walk, which meant that a blind person who could walk was denied this extra support for getting around. Under the old rules, discrimination occurred against people with a sensual disability, in favour of a physical disability, when it should have been looking at mobility.

== Personal life ==
Robertson married his wife Eleanor in 1973; they have three daughters: Wendy, Jennifer, and Laura.

== MPs&#x27; expenses scandal ==
Robertson was asked to pay back £2975 for excessive expenses claims. This included some £1750 in petty cash.
John Robertson claimed £101,577.31 office running costs for 2013–14 and a further £33,861 &#x27;other costs&#x27; Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority expenses 2013–14 
John Robertson employed his daughter, Laura Robertson, as Secretary/Caseworker as detailed in the Register of Members&#x27; Financial Interests

<text>The Mamba is a South African infantry mobility vehicle designed for internal security purposes. It was developed during the late 1980s to replace the Buffel in service with the South African military and security forces. The first models were built on a 4X2 Toyota Dyna chassis, which was subsequently replaced in production around 1994 by a more reliable Unimog chassis. All marks of the Mamba were designed to be mine-resistant and blastproof.

==Development history==
===Mamba Mk1===
The South African Army issued a requirement for a new armoured vehicle in 1987 capable of a wide variety of roles, namely border protection and internal security. The Mamba Mk1 was developed the following year and utilised the chassis of a Toyota Dyna 4X2 truck. A number were accepted into service between 1990 and 1994.

===Subsequent marks===
After 1994, the Mamba utilised a Unimog truck chassis for better off-road performance and ground clearance. The first units were derived from surplus Buffel vehicles. Its V-shaped hull is designed to deflect a mine blast away from the occupants. It is powered by a 352N Mercedes-Benz 6-cylinder diesel engine. The Mamba entered service in 1995, and is still in use with the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) and several other countries. The SANDF now uses the Mamba Mk2 and Mamba Mk3 versions, with 600 Mk2s upgraded to Mk3 configuration.

The Mamba is in length, in width, and has a height of . The four-wheeled vehicle can carry up to 10 passengers, excluding the driver. A roof hatch allows a gunner to use the weapon mount, which can be equipped with a 12.7 mm machine gun. A large door at the rear of the vehicle provides access to the passengers and crew. The Mk3 features better ballistic protection over the Mk2 – the latter can withstand impacts from up to 7.62×51mm NATO rounds, while the former is capable of handling 5.56×45mm NATO impacts. The Mk3 is also lighter, more stable, has lower operating costs and comes with an 8-speed transmission compared to the 4-speed transmission of the Mk2. However, the Mk3 has a range of only whereas the Mk2 has a range of . The Mamba also provides protection against mines of up to . It has four-wheel drive capability, and can achieve a top speed of . Apart from the APC role, the vehicle may also be used as an ambulance, a command vehicle, a VIP transport, or a logistics vehicle. The newest Mamba, the Mk5, is manufactured by N4-Trucks in South Africa, and delivers from a water-cooled Iveco engine, a range over 600 km, over 4,500 kg payload, and a B7 ballistic protection versus previous B6 capabilities of the Mk1-Mk3.

==Combat history==

Mambas have been deployed primarily with peacekeeping missions mounted by the United Nations and the African Union. The Mamba has seen active service with the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA), the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), the United Nations Force Intervention Brigade (FIB), and the British contingent of the Kosovo Force. During the Iraq War, it was widely deployed by private security contractors in Iraq.

<doc id="676657" wikidata="Q2986486" url="?curid=676657" title="RG-31 Nyala">
<text>The RG-31 Nyala is a 4×4 multi-purpose Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle manufactured in South Africa by Land Systems OMC (a division of Denel SOC LTD), located in Benoni, South Africa and in Turkey by FNSS Defence Systems. It is based on the Mamba APC of TFM Industries.

The RG-31 has become the multi-purpose vehicle of choice of the UN and other peacekeeping and security forces. It is finding favour with non-governmental organisations requiring a vehicle with a non-aggressive appearance to protect their personnel against land mines.

==Design==
The RG-31 is based on a UNIMOG chassis. It is built from a V-shaped all-steel welded armor monocoque hull and high suspension, typical of South African mine protected vehicles, providing excellent small-arms and mine blast protection. The vehicle is designed to resist a blast equivalent to two TM-57 anti-tank mines detonating simultaneously. The RG-31 is classified by the United States Department of Defense as a category 1 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle.

The vehicle accommodates a crew ranging from 5 to 10 depending on mission needs, depending on model. Dismounting is provided via a large air actuated rear door and two front doors, also air actuated.

In July 2016, the Letterkenny Army Depot in Pennsylvania rolled out the latest variant of the RG-31, with improvements including an engine upgrade from 275 to 300 hp, a transmission upgrade, independent suspension, 360-degree spotlights for night visibility, and an armored gunner&#x27;s hatch. The depot is scheduled to produce 929 improved RG-31s through 2020.

<text>John Robertson (3 February 1913 – 16 May 1987) was a British politician, who sat as a Labour Member of Parliament before co-founding the Scottish Labour Party (SLP) in 1976.

==Career==
Robertson was a toolmaker and engineer and was assistant divisional organiser of the Amalgamated Engineering Union from 1954 to 1961 and secretary of the Scottish Iron and Steel Trades Joint Committee. Joining the Labour Party in 1943, he served as a councillor on Lanarkshire County Council and Motherwell and Wishaw Council from 1946.

At the 1951 general election Robertson stood as the Labour candidate in the marginal Conservative-held seat of Glasgow Scotstoun, losing by 625 votes. He was elected to the House of Commons ten years later at the 1961 by-election in the Paisley constituency, following the appointment of sitting MP Douglas Johnston as a judge in the Court of Session. He was re-elected at five subsequent general elections.

On 18 January 1976 Robertson, along with another Labour MP, Jim Sillars and Labour&#x27;s senior Scottish researcher, Alex Neil, officially established the Scottish Labour Party (SLP). The SLP emerged as a left-wing split from the mainstream Labour Party over distrust about how strong the then Labour government&#x27;s stated commitment to Scottish devolution was in reality. Robertson was a leading figure in the SLP, along with Sillars, but unlike Sillars he stood down at the 1979 general election, deciding not to contest his Paisley seat. The Scottish Labour Party was officially disbanded in 1981, after failing to win any seats at the 1979 general election.

<doc id="676659" wikidata="Q131297" url="?curid=676659" title="Rwandan genocide">
<text>The Rwandan genocide, also known as the genocide against the Tutsi, occurred from 7 April to 19 July 1994 during the Rwandan Civil War. Over a span of around 100 days, members of the Tutsi ethnic group, as well as some moderate Hutu and Twa, were systematically killed by Hutu militias. While the Rwandan Constitution states that over 1 million people were killed, most scholarly estimates suggest between 500,000 and 662,000 Tutsi died. The genocide was marked by extreme violence, with victims often murdered by neighbors, and widespread sexual violence, with between 250,000 and 500,000 women raped.

The genocide was rooted in long-standing ethnic tensions, exacerbated by the Rwandan Civil War, which began in 1990 when the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), a predominantly Tutsi rebel group, invaded Rwanda from Uganda. The war reached a tentative peace with the Arusha Accords in 1993. However, the assassination of President Juvénal Habyarimana on 6 April 1994 ignited the genocide, as Hutu extremists used the power vacuum to target Tutsi and moderate Hutu leaders.

Despite the scale of the atrocities, the international community failed to intervene to stop the killings. The RPF resumed military operations in response to the genocide, eventually defeating the government forces and ending the genocide by capturing all government-controlled territory. This led to the flight of the génocidaires and many Hutu refugees into Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), contributing to regional instability and triggering the First Congo War in 1996.

The legacy of the genocide remains significant in Rwanda. The country has instituted public holidays to commemorate the event and passed laws criminalizing &quot;genocide ideology&quot; and &quot;divisionism&quot;.

== Background ==
=== Pre-independent Rwanda and the origins of Hutu, Tutsi and Twa groups ===
The earliest inhabitants of what is now Rwanda were the Twa, a group of aboriginal pygmy hunter-gatherers who settled in the area between 8000 BC and 3000 BC and remain in Rwanda today. Between 700 BC and 1500 AD, a number of Bantu groups migrated into Rwanda, and began to clear forest land for agriculture. Historians have several theories regarding the nature of the Bantu migrations: one theory is that the first settlers were Hutu, while the Tutsi migrated later and formed a distinct racial group, possibly of Cushitic origin. An alternative theory is that the migration was slow and steady from neighbouring regions, with incoming groups bearing high genetic similarity to the established ones, and integrating into rather than conquering the existing society. Under this theory, the Hutu and Tutsi distinction arose later and was not a racial one, but principally a class or caste distinction in which the Tutsi herded cattle while the Hutu farmed the land. The Hutu, Tutsi and Twa of Rwanda share a common language and are collectively known as the Banyarwanda.

The population coalesced, first into clans (&quot;ubwoko&quot;), and then, by 1700, into around eight kingdoms. The Kingdom of Rwanda, ruled by the Tutsi Nyiginya clan, became the dominant kingdom from the mid-eighteenth century, expanding through a process of conquest and assimilation, and achieving its greatest extent under the reign of King Kigeli Rwabugiri in 1853–1895. Rwabugiri expanded the kingdom west and north, and initiated administrative reforms which caused a rift to grow between the Hutu and Tutsi populations. These included &quot;uburetwa&quot;, a system of forced labour which Hutu had to perform to regain access to land seized from them, and &quot;ubuhake&quot;, under which Tutsi patrons ceded cattle to Hutu or Tutsi clients in exchange for economic and personal service. Although Hutu and Tutsi were often treated differently, they shared the same language and culture, the same clan names, and the same customs; the symbols of kinship served as a unifying bond between them.

Rwanda and neighbouring Burundi were assigned to Germany by the Berlin Conference of 1884, and Germany established a presence in the country in 1897 with the formation of an alliance with the king. German policy was to rule the country through the Rwandan monarchy; this system had the added benefit of enabling colonization with small European troop numbers. The colonists favoured the Tutsi over the Hutu when assigning administrative roles, believing them to be migrants from Ethiopia and racially superior. The Rwandan king welcomed the Germans, using their military strength to widen his rule. Belgian forces took control of Rwanda and Burundi in 1917 during World War I, and from 1926 began a policy of more direct colonial rule. The Belgians modernised the Rwandan economy, but Tutsi supremacy remained, leaving the Hutu disenfranchised.

In the early 1930s, Belgium introduced a permanent division of the population by classifying Rwandans into three ethnic (ethno-racial) groups, with the Hutu representing about 84% of the population, the Tutsi about 15%, and the Twa about 1%. Compulsory identity cards were issued labeling (under the heading for &quot;ethnicity and race&quot;) each individual as either Tutsi, Hutu, Twa, or Naturalised. While it had previously been possible for particularly wealthy Hutus to become honorary Tutsis, the identity cards prevented any further movement between the groups and made socio-economic groups into rigid ethnic groups.

The ethnic identities of the Hutu and Tutsi were reshaped and mythologized by the colonizers. Christian missionaries in Rwanda promoted the theory about the &quot;Hamitic&quot; origins of the kingdom, and referred to the distinctively Ethiopian features and hence, foreign origins, of the Tutsi &quot;caste&quot;. These mythologies provide the basis for anti-Tutsi propaganda in 1994. Starkly contrasted, the Tutsi origin myth holds that Kanyarwanda had several sons, including Gatutsi and Gahutu, ancestors of the Tutsi and Hutu who are therefore brothers. The Hutu origin myth holds that Kigwa (patrilineal ancestor of Ruhanga and the first Tutsi) fell from the sky on an earth inhabited by Hutu.

=== Revolution and Hutu–Tutsi relations after independence ===

After World War II, a Hutu emancipation movement began to grow in Rwanda, fuelled by increasing resentment of the inter-war social reforms, and also an increasing sympathy for the Hutu within the Catholic Church. Catholic missionaries increasingly viewed themselves as responsible for empowering the underprivileged Hutu rather than the Tutsi elite, leading rapidly to the formation of a sizeable Hutu clergy and educated elite that provided a new counterbalance to the established political order. The monarchy and prominent Tutsis sensed the growing influence of the Hutu and began to agitate for immediate independence on their own terms. In 1957, a group of Hutu scholars wrote the &quot;Bahutu Manifesto&quot;. This was the first document to label the Tutsi and Hutu as separate races, and called for the transfer of power from Tutsi to Hutu based on what it termed &quot;statistical law&quot;.
On 1 November 1959 Dominique Mbonyumutwa, a Hutu sub-chief, was attacked close to his home in Byimana, Gitarama prefecture, by supporters of the pro-Tutsi party. Mbonyumutwa survived, but rumours began spreading that he had been killed. Hutu activists responded by killing Tutsis, both the elite and ordinary civilians, marking the beginning of the Rwandan Revolution. The Tutsi responded with attacks of their own, but by this stage the Hutu had full backing from the Belgian administration who wanted to overturn the Tutsi domination. In early 1960, the Belgians replaced most Tutsi chiefs with Hutu and organised mid-year commune elections which returned an overwhelming Hutu majority. The king was deposed, a Hutu-dominated republic created, and the country became independent in 1962.
As the revolution progressed, Tutsis began leaving the country to escape the Hutu purges, settling in the four neighbouring countries: Burundi, Uganda, Tanzania and Zaire. These exiles, unlike the Banyarwanda who migrated during the pre-colonial and colonial era, were regarded as refugees in their host countries, and began almost immediately to agitate for a return to Rwanda. They formed armed groups who launched attacks into Rwanda; these were largely unsuccessful, and led to further reprisal killings of 10,000 Tutsis and further Tutsi exiles. By 1964, more than 300,000 Tutsis had fled, and were forced to remain in exile for the next three decades.

Grégoire Kayibanda presided over a Hutu republic for the next decade, imposing an autocratic rule similar to the pre-revolution feudal monarchy. He was overthrown following a coup in 1973, which brought President Juvénal Habyarimana to power.
Pro-Hutu and Anti-Tutsi discrimination continued in Rwanda itself, although the indiscriminate violence against the Tutsi did decrease somewhat. Habyarimana founded the National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (MRND) party in 1975, and promulgated a new constitution following a 1978 referendum, making the country a one-party state in which every citizen had to belong to the MRND.

At , Rwanda&#x27;s population density is among the highest in Africa. Rwanda&#x27;s population had increased from 1.6 million people in 1934 to 7.1 million in 1989, leading to competition for land. Historians such as Gérard Prunier believe that the 1994 genocide can be partly attributed to population density.

=== Rwandan Civil War ===
In the 1980s, a group of 500 Rwandan refugees in Uganda, led by Fred Rwigyema, fought with the rebel National Resistance Army (NRA) in the Ugandan Bush War, which saw Yoweri Museveni overthrow Milton Obote. These soldiers remained in the Ugandan army following Museveni&#x27;s inauguration as Ugandan president, but simultaneously began planning an invasion of Rwanda through a covert network within the army&#x27;s ranks. In October 1990, Rwigyema led a force of over 4,000 rebels from Uganda, advancing into Rwanda under the banner of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). Rwigyema was killed on the third day of the attack, and France and Zaire deployed forces in support of the Rwandan army, allowing them to repel the invasion. Rwigyema&#x27;s deputy, Paul Kagame, took command of the RPF forces, organising a tactical retreat through Uganda to the Virunga Mountains, a rugged area of northern Rwanda. From there, he rearmed and reorganised the army, and carried out fundraising and recruitment from the Tutsi diaspora.

Kagame restarted the war in January 1991, with a surprise attack on the northern town of Ruhengeri. The RPF captured the town, benefiting from the element of surprise, and held it for one day before retreating to the forests. For the next year, the RPF waged a hit-and-run style guerrilla war, capturing some border areas but not making significant gains against the Rwandan army. In June 1992, following the formation of a multiparty coalition government in Kigali, the RPF announced a ceasefire and began negotiations with the Rwandan government in Arusha, Tanzania. In early 1993, several extremist Hutu groups formed and began campaigns of large scale violence against the Tutsi. The RPF responded by suspending peace talks and launching a major attack, gaining a large swathe of land across the north of the country. Peace negotiations eventually resumed in Arusha; the resulting set of agreements, known as the Arusha Accords, were signed in August 1993 and gave the RPF positions in a Broad-Based Transitional Government (BBTG) and in the national army. The United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), a peacekeeping force, arrived in the country and the RPF were given a base in the national parliament building in Kigali, for use during the setting up of the BBTG.

=== Hutu Power movement ===
In the early years of Habyarimana&#x27;s regime, there was greater economic prosperity and reduced violence against Tutsis. Many hardline anti-Tutsi figures remained, including the family of the first lady Agathe Habyarimana, who were known as the &quot;akazu&quot; or &quot;clan de Madame&quot;, and the president relied on them to maintain his regime. When the RPF invaded in October 1990, Habyarimana and the hardliners exploited the fear of the population to advance an anti-Tutsi agenda which became known as Hutu Power. 
Tutsi were increasingly viewed with suspicion. A pogrom was organised on 11 October 1990 in a commune in Gisenyi Province, killing 383 Tutsi. A group of military officers and government members founded a magazine called &quot;Kangura&quot;, which became popular throughout the country. This published anti-Tutsi propaganda, including the Hutu Ten Commandments, an explicit set of racist guidelines, including labelling Hutus who married Tutsis as &quot;traitors&quot;. In 1992, the hardliners created the Coalition for the Defence of the Republic (CDR) party, which was linked to the ruling party but more right-wing, and promoted an agenda critical of the president&#x27;s alleged &quot;softness&quot; with the RPF.

To make the economic, social and political conflict look more like an ethnic conflict, the President&#x27;s entourage, including the army, launched propaganda campaigns to fabricate events of ethnic crisis caused by the Tutsi and the RPF. The process was described as &quot;mirror politics&quot;, also known as &quot;accusation in a mirror&quot; whereby a person accuses others of what the person himself/herself actually wants to do.

Following the 1992 ceasefire agreement, a number of the extremists in the Rwandan government and army began actively plotting against the president, worried about the possibility of Tutsis being included in government. Habyarimana attempted to remove the hardliners from senior army positions, but was only partially successful; &quot;akazu&quot; affiliates Augustin Ndindiliyimana and Théoneste Bagosora remained in powerful posts, providing the hardline family with a link to power. Throughout 1992, the hardliners carried out campaigns of localised killings of Tutsi, culminating in January 1993, in which extremists and local Hutu murdered around 300 people. When the RPF resumed hostilities in February 1993, it cited these killings as the primary motive, but its effect was to increase support for the extremists among the Hutu population.

From mid-1993, the Hutu Power movement represented a third major force in Rwandan politics, in addition to Habyarimana&#x27;s government and the traditional moderate opposition. Apart from the CDR, there was no party that was exclusively part of the Power movement. Instead, almost every party was split into &quot;moderate&quot; and &quot;Power&quot; wings, with members of both camps claiming to represent the legitimate leadership of that party. Even the ruling party contained a Power wing, consisting of those who opposed Habyarimana&#x27;s intention to sign a peace deal. Several radical youth militia groups emerged, attached to the Power wings of the parties; these included the &quot;Interahamwe&quot; (&quot;those who stand together&quot;), which was attached to the ruling party, and the CDR&#x27;s &quot;Impuzamugambi&quot; (&quot;those who have the same goal&quot;). The youth militia began actively carrying out massacres across the country. The army trained the militias, sometimes in conjunction with the French, who were unaware of their true purpose.

== Prelude ==
To what extent the Rwandan genocide was planned in advance of the assassination of Habyarimana continues to be debated by historians. Prosecutors at the ICTR argued, but were unable to prove, that the defendants planned the genocide prior to Habyarimana&#x27;s assassination.

=== Timeline ===
In 1990, the army began arming civilians with weapons such as machetes, and it began training the Hutu youth in combat, officially as a programme of &quot;civil defence&quot; against the RPF threat, but these weapons were later used to carry out the genocide. In particular, the Hutu Power leaders organized a paramilitary or militia force known as the &quot;Interahamwe&quot; and the &quot;Impuzamugambi&quot;. These groups served to provide auxiliary slaughterhouse support to the police, the gendarmerie and the regular army. These militias were primarily recruited from the vast pool of Hutu internally displaced persons driven from their homes in the North, and claimed a total membership of 50,000 on the eve of genocide Rwanda also purchased large numbers of grenades and munitions from late 1990; in one deal, future UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in his role as Egyptian foreign minister, facilitated a large sale of arms from Egypt. The Rwandan Armed Forces (FAR) expanded rapidly at this time, growing from less than 10,000 troops to almost 30,000 in one year. The new recruits were often poorly disciplined; a divide grew between the elite Presidential Guard and Gendarmerie units, who were well trained and battle ready, and the ordinary rank and file, respectively.

In March 1993, Hutu Power began compiling lists of &quot;traitors&quot; whom they planned to kill, and it is possible that Habyarimana&#x27;s name was on these lists; the CDR were publicly accusing the president of treason.

During 1993, the hardliners imported machetes on a scale far larger than what was required for agriculture, as well as other tools which could be used as weapons, such as razor blades, saws and scissors. These tools were distributed around the country, ostensibly as part of the civil defence network.
In October 1993, the President of Burundi, Melchior Ndadaye, who had been elected in June as the country&#x27;s first ever Hutu president, was assassinated by extremist Tutsi army officers. The assassination sparked the Burundi Civil War between Burundi&#x27;s Hutu and Tutsi and the Burundi genocide, with 50,000 to 100,000 people killed in the first year of war. The assassination caused shockwaves, reinforcing the notion among Hutus that the Tutsi were their enemy and could not be trusted. The CDR and the Power wings of the other parties realised they could use this situation to their advantage. The idea of a deliberate and systematic genocide, which had first been suggested in 1992 but had remained a fringe viewpoint, was now top of their agenda, and they began actively planning it. They were confident of persuading the Hutu population to carry out killings, given the public anger at Ndadaye&#x27;s murder, as well as RTLM propaganda and the traditional obedience of Rwandans to authority. The Power leaders began arming the &quot;interahamwe&quot; and other militia groups with AK-47s and other weapons; previously, they had possessed only machetes and traditional hand weapons.

On 11 January 1994, General Roméo Dallaire, commander of UNAMIR, sent his &quot;Genocide Fax&quot; to UN Headquarters. The fax stated that Dallaire was in contact with &quot;a top level trainer in the cadre of Interhamwe-armed [&quot;sic&quot;] militia of MRND.&quot; The informant—now known to be Mathieu Ngirumpatse&#x27;s chauffeur, Kassim Turatsinze, a.k.a. &quot;Jean-Pierre&quot;—claimed to have been ordered to register all Tutsi in Kigali. According to the memo, Turatsinze suspected that a genocide against the Tutsis was being planned, and he said that &quot;in 20 minutes his personnel could kill up to 1000 Tutsis&quot;. Dallaire&#x27;s request to protect the informant and his family and to raid the weapons caches he revealed was denied.

The ICTR prosecution was unable to prove that a conspiracy to commit genocide existed prior to 7 April 1994. The supposed mastermind, Théoneste Bagosora, was acquitted of that charge in 2008, although he was convicted of genocide. André Guichaoua, an expert witness for the ICTR prosecution, noted in 2010:

=== Radio station RTLM ===

The Power groups believed that the national radio station, Radio Rwanda, had become too liberal and supportive of the opposition; they founded a new radio station, Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines (RTLM). The RTLM was designed to appeal to the young adults in Rwanda and had extensive reach. Unlike newspapers that could only be found in cities, the radio broadcasts were accessible to Rwanda&#x27;s largely rural population of farmers. The format of the broadcasts mirrored Western-style radio talk shows that played popular music, hosted interviews, and encouraged audience participation. The broadcasters told crude jokes and used offensive language that contrasted strongly with Radio Rwanda&#x27;s more formal news reports. Just 1.52% of RTLM&#x27;s airtime was dedicated to news, while 66.29% of airtime featured the journalists discussing their thoughts on different subjects. As the start of the genocide approached, the RTLM broadcasts focused on anti-Tutsi propaganda. They characterized the Tutsi as a dangerous enemy who wanted to seize the political power at the expense of Hutus. By linking the Rwandan Patriotic Army with the Tutsi political party and ordinary Tutsi citizens, they classified the entire ethnic group as one homogeneous threat to Rwandans. The RTLM went further than amplifying ethnic and political division; it also labeled the Tutsi as &quot;inyenzi&quot;, meaning non-human pests or cockroaches, which must be exterminated. Leading up to the genocide, there were 294 instances of the RTLM accusing the Rwandan Patriotic Army of atrocities against the Hutu, along with 252 broadcasts that called for Hutus to kill the Tutsis. One such broadcast stated, &quot;Someone must... make them disappear for good... to wipe them from human memory... to exterminate the Tutsi from the surface of the earth.&quot; By the time the violence began, the young Hutu population had absorbed months of racist propaganda that characterized all Tutsis as dangerous enemies that must be killed before they seized control of the country. The RTLM&#x27;s role in the genocide earned it the nickname &quot;Radio Machete&quot; as it related to their incitement to genocide. A 2014 study by Harvard Kennedy School researcher David Yanagizawa-Drott found that approximately 10% of the overall violence during the Rwandan genocide can be attributed to this new radio station. Gordon Danning, a researcher with the free speech advocacy group Foundation for Individual Rights in Education questioned the assumption of that paper that media availability correlated with media consumption.

=== Assassination of Habyarimana ===

On 6 April 1994, the airplane carrying Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira, the Hutu president of Burundi, was shot down as it prepared to land in Kigali, killing everyone on board. Responsibility for the attack was disputed, with both the RPF and Hutu extremists being blamed. In 2006, an eight-year investigation by the French judge Jean-Louis Bruguière concluded that Paul Kagame had ordered the assassination. An investigation by the Rwandan government made public in 2010 blamed Hutu extremists in the Rwandan army. In January 2012, a French investigation was widely published as exonerating the RPF, but according to Filip Reyntjens, the report did not exonerate the RPF. In November 2014, Emmanuel Mughisa (also known as Emile Gafarita), a former Rwandan soldier who said he had evidence that Kagame had ordered Habyarimana&#x27;s plane shot down, was abducted in Nairobi hours after he was called to testify at the French inquiry. He was reportedly &quot;join[ing] a long list of Mr Kagame&#x27;s opponents who have disappeared or died&quot;. Despite disagreements about the perpetrators, many observers believe the attack and deaths of the two Hutu presidents served as the catalyst for the genocide.

Following Habyarimana&#x27;s death, on the evening of 6 April, a crisis committee was formed; it consisted of Major General Augustin Ndindiliyimana, Colonel Théoneste Bagosora, and a number of other senior army staff officers. The committee was headed by Bagosora, despite the presence of the more senior Ndindiliyimana. Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana was legally next in the line of political succession, but the committee refused to recognise her authority. Roméo Dallaire met with the committee that night and insisted that Uwilingiyimana be placed in charge, but Bagosora refused, saying Uwilingiyimana did not &quot;enjoy the confidence of the Rwandan people&quot; and was &quot;incapable of governing the nation&quot;. The committee also justified its existence as being essential to avoid uncertainty following the president&#x27;s death. Bagosora sought to convince UNAMIR and the RPF that the committee was acting to contain the presidential guard, which he described as &quot;out of control&quot;, and that it would abide by the Arusha agreement.

=== Killing of moderate leaders ===
UNAMIR sent an escort of ten Belgian soldiers to Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana, with the intention of transporting her to the Radio Rwanda offices to address the nation. This plan was canceled because the presidential guard took over the radio station shortly afterward and would not permit Uwilingiyimana to speak on air. Later in the morning, a number of soldiers and a crowd of civilians overwhelmed the Belgians guarding Uwilingiyimana, forcing them to surrender their weapons. Uwilingiyimana and her husband were killed, although their children survived by hiding behind furniture and were rescued by Senegalese UNAMIR officer Mbaye Diagne. The ten Belgians were taken to the Camp Kigali military base, where they were tortured and killed. Major Bernard Ntuyahaga, the commanding officer of the presidential guard unit which carried out the murders, was sentenced to 20 years&#x27; imprisonment by a court in Belgium in 2007.

In addition to assassinating Uwilingiyimana, the extremists spent the night of 6–7 April moving around the houses of Kigali with lists of prominent moderate politicians and journalists, on a mission to kill them. Fatalities that evening included President of the Constitutional Court Joseph Kavaruganda, Minister of Agriculture Frederic Nzamurambaho, Parti Liberal leader Landwald Ndasingwa and his Canadian wife, and chief Arusha negotiator Boniface Ngulinzira. A few moderates survived, including prime minister-designate Faustin Twagiramungu, but the plot was largely successful. According to Dallaire, &quot;by noon on 7 April, the moderate political leadership of Rwanda was dead or in hiding, the potential for a future moderate government utterly lost.&quot; An exception to this was the new army chief of staff, Marcel Gatsinzi; Bagosora&#x27;s preferred candidate Augustin Bizimungu was rejected by the crisis committee, forcing Bagosora to agree to Gatsinzi&#x27;s appointment. Gatsinzi attempted to keep the army out of the genocide, and to negotiate a ceasefire with the RPF, but he had only limited control over his troops and was replaced by the hardline Bizimungu after just ten days.

== Genocide ==

Genocidal killings began the following day. Soldiers, police, and militia quickly executed key Tutsi and moderate Hutu military and political leaders who could have assumed control in the ensuing power vacuum. Checkpoints and barricades were erected to screen all holders of the national ID card of Rwanda, which contained ethnic classifications. This enabled government forces to systematically identify and kill Tutsi.

They also recruited and pressured Hutu civilians to arm themselves with machetes, clubs, blunt objects, and other weapons and encouraged them to rape, maim, and kill their Tutsi neighbors and to destroy or steal their property. The RPF restarted its offensive soon after Habyarimana&#x27;s assassination. It rapidly seized control of the northern part of the country and captured Kigali about 100 days later in mid-July, bringing an end to the genocide. During these events and in the aftermath, the United Nations (UN) and countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Belgium were criticized for their inaction and failure to strengthen the force and mandate of the UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) peacekeepers. In December 2017, media reported revelations that the government of France had allegedly supported the Hutu government after the genocide had begun.

=== Planning and organization ===
The large-scale killing of Tutsi on the grounds of ethnicity began within a few hours of Habyarimana&#x27;s death. The crisis committee, headed by Théoneste Bagosora, took power in the country following Habyarimana&#x27;s death, and was the principal authority coordinating the genocide. Following the assassination of Habyarimana, Bagosora immediately began issuing orders to kill Tutsi, addressing groups of &quot;interahamwe&quot; in person in Kigali, and making telephone calls to leaders in the prefectures. Other leading organisers on a national level were defence minister Augustin Bizimana; commander of the paratroopers Aloys Ntabakuze; and the head of the Presidential Guard, Protais Mpiranya. Businessman Félicien Kabuga funded the RTLM and the Interahamwe, while Pascal Musabe and Joseph Nzirorera were responsible for coordinating the Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi militia activities nationally.

Military leaders in Gisenyi prefecture, the heartland of the &quot;akazu&quot;, were initially the most organized, convening a gathering of the Interahamwe and civilian Hutus; the commanders announced the president&#x27;s death, blaming the RPF, and then ordered the crowd to &quot;begin your work&quot; and to &quot;spare no one&quot;, including infants. The killing spread to Ruhengeri, Kibuye, Kigali, Kibungo, Gikongoro and Cyangugu prefectures on 7 April; in each case, local officials, responding to orders from Kigali, spread rumours that the RPF had killed the president, followed by a command to kill Tutsi. The Hutu population, which had been prepared and armed during the preceding months, and maintained the Rwandan tradition of obedience to authority, carried out the orders without question. On the other hand, there are views that the genocide was not sudden, irresistible or uniformly orchestrated, but &quot;a cascade of tipping points, and each tipping point was the outcome of local, intra-ethnic contests for dominance (among Hutu)&quot;. The protracted struggles for supremacy in local communes meant that a more determined stance from the international community would likely have prevented the worst from happening.

In Kigali, the genocide was led by the Presidential Guard, the elite unit of the army. They were assisted by the Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi, who set up roadblocks throughout the capital; each person passing the roadblock was required to show the national identity card, which included ethnicity, and any with Tutsi cards were killed immediately. The militias also initiated searches of houses in the city, killing Tutsi and looting their property. Tharcisse Renzaho, the prefect of Kigali-ville, played a leading role, touring the roadblocks to ensure their effectiveness and using his position at the top of the Kigali provincial government to disseminate orders and dismiss officials who were not sufficiently active in the killings.

In rural areas, the local government hierarchy was also in most cases the chain of command for the execution of the genocide. The prefect of each prefecture, acting on orders from Kigali, disseminated instructions to the commune leaders (&quot;bourgmestres&quot;), who in turn issued directions to the leaders of the sectors, cells and villages within their communes. The majority of the actual killings in the countryside were carried out by ordinary civilians, under orders from the leaders. Tutsi and Hutu lived side by side in their villages, and families all knew each other, making it easy for Hutu to identify and target their Tutsi neighbours. Gerard Prunier ascribes this mass complicity of the population to a combination of the &quot;democratic majority&quot; ideology, in which Hutu had been taught to regard Tutsi as dangerous enemies, the culture of unbending obedience to authority, and the duress factor—villagers who refused to carry out orders to kill were often branded as Tutsi sympathisers and they themselves killed.

There were few killings in the prefectures of Gitarama and Butare during the early phase, as the prefects of those areas were moderates opposed to the violence. The genocide began in Gitarama after the interim government relocated to the prefecture on 12 April. Butare was ruled by the only Tutsi prefect in the country, Jean-Baptiste Habyalimana. Habyalimana refused to authorise any killings in his territory, and for a while Butare became a sanctuary for Tutsi refugees from elsewhere in the country. This lasted until 18 April, when the interim government dismissed him from his post and replaced him with government loyalist Sylvain Nsabimana.

The crisis committee appointed an interim government on 8 April; using the terms of the 1991 constitution instead of the Arusha Accords, the committee designated Théodore Sindikubwabo as interim president of Rwanda, while Jean Kambanda was the new prime minister. All political parties were represented in the government, but most members were from the &quot;Hutu Power&quot; wings of their respective parties. The interim government was sworn in on 9 April, but relocated from Kigali to Gitarama on 12 April, ostensibly fleeing RPF&#x27;s advance on the capital. The crisis committee was officially dissolved, but Bagosora and the senior officers remained the de facto rulers of the country. The government played its part in mobilising the population, giving the regime an air of legitimacy, but was effectively a puppet regime with no ability to halt the army or the &quot;Interahamwe&#x27;s&quot; activities. When Roméo Dallaire visited the government&#x27;s headquarters a week after its formation, he found most officials at leisure, describing their activities as &quot;sorting out the seating plan for a meeting that was not about to convene any time soon&quot;.

=== Death toll and timeline ===
During the remainder of April and early May, the Presidential Guard, &quot;gendarmerie&quot; and the youth militia, aided by local populations, continued killing at a very high rate. The goal was to kill every Tutsi living in Rwanda and, with the exception of the advancing rebel RPF army, there was no opposition force to prevent or slow the killings. The domestic opposition had already been eliminated, and UNAMIR were expressly forbidden to use force except in self-defence. In rural areas, where Tutsi and Hutu lived side by side and families knew each other, it was easy for Hutu to identify and target their Tutsi neighbours. In urban areas, where residents were more anonymous, identification was facilitated using roadblocks manned by military and interahamwe; each person passing the roadblock was required to show the national identity card, which included ethnicity, and any with Tutsi cards were killed immediately. Many Hutu were also killed for a variety of reasons, including alleged sympathy for the moderate opposition parties, being a journalist or simply having a &quot;Tutsi appearance&quot;. Thousands of bodies were dumped into the Kagera River, which ran along the northern border between Rwanda and Uganda and flowed into Lake Victoria. This disposal of bodies caused significant damage to the Ugandan fishing industry, as consumers refused to buy fish caught in Lake Victoria for fear that they were tainted by decomposing corpses. The Ugandan government responded by dispatching teams to retrieve the bodies from the Kagera River before they entered the lake.

The RPF was making slow but steady gains in the north and east of the country, ending the killings in each area occupied. The genocide was effectively ended during April in areas of Ruhengeri, Byumba, Kibungo and Kigali prefectures. The killings ceased during April in the &quot;akazu&quot; heartlands of western Ruhengeri and Gisenyi, as almost every Tutsi had been eliminated. Large numbers of Hutu in the RPF-conquered areas fled, fearing retribution for the genocide; 500,000 Kibungo residents walked over the bridge at Rusumo Falls into Tanzania in a few days at the end of April, and were accommodated in United Nations camps effectively controlled by ousted leaders of the Hutu regime, with the former prefect of Kibungo prefecture in overall control.

In the remaining prefectures, killings continued throughout May and June, although they became increasingly sporadic; most Tutsi were already dead, and the interim government wished to rein in the growing anarchy and engage the population in fighting the RPF. On 23 June, around 2,500 soldiers entered southwestern Rwanda as part of the French-led United Nations &quot;Opération Turquoise&quot;. This was intended as a humanitarian mission, but the soldiers were not able to save significant numbers of lives. The genocidal authorities were overtly welcoming of the French, displaying the French flag on their own vehicles, but killing Tutsi who came out of hiding seeking protection. In July, the RPF completed their conquest of the country, with the exception of the zone occupied by Operation Turquoise. The RPF took Kigali on 4 July, and Gisenyi and the rest of the northwest on 18 July. The genocide was over, but as had occurred in Kibungo, the Hutu population fled en masse across the border, this time into Zaire, with Bagosora and the other leaders accompanying them.

The succeeding RPF government claims that 1,074,017 people were killed in the genocide, 94% of whom were Tutsi. In contrast, Human Rights Watch, following on-the-ground research, estimated the casualties at 507,000 people. According to a 2020 symposium of the &quot;Journal of Genocide Research&quot;, the official figure is not credible as it overestimates the number of Tutsi in Rwanda prior to the genocide. Using different methodologies, the scholars in the symposium estimated 500,000 to 600,000 deaths in the genocide—around two-thirds of the Tutsis in Rwanda at the time. Thousands of widows, many of whom were subjected to rape, became HIV-positive. There were about 400,000 orphans and nearly 85,000 of them were forced to become heads of families. An estimated 2,000,000 Rwandans, mostly Hutu, were displaced and became refugees. Additionally, 30% of the Pygmy Batwa were killed.

=== Means of killing ===

On 9 April, UN observers witnessed the massacre of children at a Polish church in Gikondo. The same day, 1,000 heavily armed and well-trained European troops arrived to escort European civilian personnel out of the country. The troops did not stay to assist UNAMIR. Media coverage picked up on the 9th, as &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported the execution of Rwandan employees of relief agencies in front of their expatriate colleagues.

Butare prefecture was an exception to the local violence. Jean-Baptiste Habyalimana was the only Tutsi prefect, and the prefecture was the only one dominated by an opposition party. Opposing the genocide, Habyalimana was able to keep relative calm in the prefecture, until he was deposed by the extremist Sylvain Nsabimana. Finding the population of Butare resistant to murdering their citizens, the government flew in militia from Kigali by helicopter, and they readily killed the Tutsi.

Most of the victims were killed in their own villages or in towns, often by their neighbors and fellow villagers. The militia typically murdered victims with machetes, although some army units used rifles. The Hutu gangs searched out victims hiding in churches and school buildings and massacred them. Local officials and government-sponsored radio incited ordinary citizens to kill their neighbors, and those who refused to kill were often murdered on the spot: &quot;Either you took part in the massacres or you were massacred yourself.&quot;

One such massacre occurred at Nyarubuye. On 12 April, more than 1,500 Tutsi sought refuge in a Catholic church in Nyange, then in Kivumu commune. Local Interahamwe, acting in concert with the authorities, used bulldozers to knock down the church building. The militia used machetes and rifles to kill every person who tried to escape. Local priest Athanase Seromba was later found guilty and sentenced to life in prison by the ICTR for his role in the demolition of his church; he was convicted of the crime of genocide and crimes against humanity. In another case, thousands sought refuge in the Official Technical School (&quot;École technique officielle&quot;) in Kigali where Belgian UNAMIR soldiers were stationed. On 11 April, the Belgian soldiers withdrew, and Rwandan armed forces and militia killed all the Tutsi.

=== Sexual violence ===

Rape was used as a tool by the Interahamwe, the chief perpetrators, to separate the consciously heterogeneous population and to drastically exhaust the opposing group. The use of propaganda played an important role in both the genocide and the gender specific violence. The Hutu propaganda depicted Tutsi women as &quot;a sexually seductive &#x27;fifth column&#x27; in league with the Hutus&#x27; enemies&quot;. The exceptional brutality of the sexual violence, as well as the complicity of Hutu women in the attacks, suggests that the use of propaganda had been effective in the exploitation of gendered needs which had mobilized both females and males to participate. Soldiers of the Army for the Liberation of Rwanda and the Rwandan Defence Forces, including the Presidential Guard, and civilians also committed rape against mostly Tutsi women. Although Tutsi women were the main targets, moderate Hutu women were also raped.

Along with the Hutu moderates, Hutu women who were married to or who hid Tutsis were also targeted. In his 1996 report on Rwanda, the UN Special &quot;Rapporteur&quot; Rene Degni-Segui stated, &quot;Rape was the rule and its absence was the exception.&quot; He also noted, &quot;Rape was systematic and was used as a weapon.&quot; With this thought and using methods of force and threat, the genocidaires forced others to stand by during rapes. A testimonial by a woman of the name Marie Louise Niyobuhungiro recalled seeing local peoples, other generals and Hutu men watching her get raped about five times a day. Even when she was kept under watch of a woman, the woman would give no sympathy or help and furthermore forced her to farm land in between rapes.

Many of the survivors became infected with HIV from the HIV-infected men recruited by the genocidaires. During the conflict, Hutu extremists released hundreds of patients suffering from AIDS from hospitals, and formed them into &quot;rape squads&quot;. The intent was to infect and cause a &quot;slow, inexorable death&quot; for their future Tutsi rape victims. Tutsi women were also targeted with the intent of destroying their reproductive capabilities. Sexual mutilation sometimes occurred after the rape and included mutilation of the vagina with machetes, knives, sharpened sticks, boiling water, and acid. Men were also the victims of sexual violation, including public mutilation of the genitals.

Some experts have estimated that between 250,000 and 500,000 women were raped during the genocide.

== Killing of the Twa ==
The pygmy people called the Batwa (or &quot;Twa&quot;) made up about 1% of Rwanda&#x27;s population. A report shows that the group has been described as people who lived in forests and off lands, but currently the Twa are dispersed in the country in smaller groups while integrating into society. Although the Twa were not directly targeted by the genocidaires, an estimated 10,000 of a population of 30,000 were nonetheless killed. They are sometimes referred to as the &quot;forgotten victims&quot; of the Rwandan genocide. In the months leading up to the genocide, Hutu radio stations accused the Batwa of aiding the RPF and Twa survivors describe Hutu fighters as threatening to kill them all.

== Rwandan Patriotic Front&#x27;s military campaign and victory ==

On 7 April, as the genocide started, RPF commander Paul Kagame warned the crisis committee and UNAMIR that he would resume the civil war if the killing did not stop. The next day, Rwandan government forces attacked the national parliament building from several directions, but RPF troops stationed there successfully fought back. The RPF then began an attack from the north on three fronts, seeking to link up quickly with the isolated troops in Kigali. Kagame refused to talk to the interim government, believing that it was just a cover for Bagosora&#x27;s rule and not committed to ending the genocide. Over the next few days, the RPF advanced steadily south, capturing Gabiro and large areas of the countryside to the north and east of Kigali. They avoided attacking the capital city Kigali or Byumba, but conducted manoeuvres designed to encircle the cities and cut off supply routes. The RPF also allowed Tutsi refugees from Uganda to settle behind the front line in the RPF controlled areas.

Throughout April, there were numerous attempts by UNAMIR to establish a ceasefire, but Kagame insisted each time that the RPF would not stop fighting unless the killings stopped. In late April, the RPF secured the whole of the Tanzanian border area and began to move west from Kibungo, to the south of Kigali. They encountered little resistance, except around Kigali and Ruhengeri. By 16 May, they had cut the road between Kigali and Gitarama, the temporary home of the interim government, and by 13 June, had taken Gitarama itself, following an unsuccessful attempt by the Rwandan government forces to reopen the road; the interim government was forced to relocate to Gisenyi in the far north west. As well as fighting the war, Kagame was recruiting heavily to expand the army. The new recruits included Tutsi survivors of the genocide and refugees from Burundi, but were less well trained and disciplined than the earlier recruits.

Having completed the encirclement of Kigali, the RPF spent the latter half of June fighting for the city itself. The government forces had superior manpower and weapons, but the RPF steadily gained territory as well as conducting raids to rescue civilians from behind enemy lines. According to Dallaire, this success was due to Kagame&#x27;s being a &quot;master of psychological warfare&quot;; he exploited the fact that the government forces were concentrating on the genocide rather than the fight for Kigali, and capitalised on the government&#x27;s loss of morale as it lost territory. The RPF finally defeated the Rwandan government forces in Kigali on 4 July, and on 18 July took Gisenyi and the rest of the northwest, forcing the interim government to flee into Zaire and finally ending the genocide. At the end of July 1994, Kagame&#x27;s forces held the whole of Rwanda except for the zone in the south-west which had been occupied by a French-led United Nations force as part of Opération Turquoise.

The Liberation Day for Rwanda would come to be marked as 4 July and is commemorated as a public holiday.

===Killings by the Rwandan Patriotic Front===

During the genocide and in the months following the RPF victory, RPF soldiers killed many people, although the number of casualties is disputed. Alison Des Forges was one of the first researchers to conclude that RPF committed atrocities in a systematic fashion that were directed by officers with a high level of authority. She estimated that RPF killed around 30,000 people considered enemies of the Tutsi. Some witnesses blamed Kagame himself for ordering killings. After ICTR investigators reportedly discovered two layers of bodies in a mass grave in Kibuye in early 1996—one of Tutsi victims of the genocide and another left by RPF killings of Hutu civilians—further forensic investigations were prohibited by the Rwandan government. French scholar André Guichaoua charged the post-genocide government with deliberate destruction of evidence regarding killings of Hutu to avoid prosecution by the ICTR. Some critics have suggested that these crimes should have been prosecuted by the ICTR, or even amounted to genocide under international law. In contrast, the post-genocide regime maintains that killings by RPF soldiers were perpetrated by undisciplined recruits seeking revenge and that all such transgressions were promptly punished.

The first rumours of RPF killings emerged after 250,000 mostly Hutu refugees streamed into Tanzania at the border crossing of Rusumo on 28 April 1994. The refugees had fled before the Tutsi rebels arrived because they believed the RPF were committing atrocities. A spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) observed that &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of propaganda by the Government radio aimed at the Hutu&quot; which &quot;makes them feel very anti-Tutsi.&quot; After the RPF took control of the border crossing at Rusumo on 30 April, refugees continued to cross the Kagera River, ending up in remote areas of Tanzania. In early May, the UNHCR began hearing concrete accounts of atrocities and made this information public on 17 May.

After the RPF took power in Rwanda, UNHCR sent a team led by Robert Gersony to investigate the prospects for a speedy return of the nearly two million refugees that had fled Rwanda since April. After interviewing 300 people, Gersony concluded that &quot;clearly systematic murders and persecution of the Hutu population in certain parts of the country&quot; had taken place. Gersony&#x27;s findings were suppressed by the United Nations. The Gersony Report did not technically exist because Gersony did not complete it, but a summary of an oral presentation of his findings was leaked in 2010. Gersony&#x27;s personal conclusion was that between April and August 1994, the RPF had killed &quot;between 25,000 and 45,000 persons, between 5,000 and 10,000 persons each month from April through July and 5,000 for the month of August.&quot; The new authorities categorically denied the allegations of Gersony, details of which leaked to the press. According to an RPA officer, &quot;There was not time to do proper screening. ... We needed a force, and some of those recruited were thieves and criminals. Those people have been responsible for much of our trouble today.&quot; In an interview with journalist Stephen Kinzer, Kagame acknowledged that killings had occurred but stated that they were carried out by rogue soldiers and had been impossible to control.

The RPF killings gained international attention with the 1995 Kibeho massacre, in which soldiers opened fire on a camp for internally displaced persons in Butare prefecture. Australian soldiers serving as part of UNAMIR estimated at least 4,000 people were killed, while the Rwandan government claimed that the death toll was 338.

== International involvement ==
=== United Nations ===
The United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) had been in Rwanda since October 1993, with a mandate to oversee the implementation of the Arusha Accords. UNAMIR commander Roméo Dallaire learned of the Hutu Power movement during the mission&#x27;s deployment, as well as plans for the mass extermination of Tutsi. He also became aware of secret weapons caches through an informant, but his request to raid them was turned down by the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO), which felt that Dallaire was exceeding his mandate and had to be kept &quot;on a leash&quot;. Seizing the weapons was argued to be squarely within UNAMIR&#x27;s mandate; both sides had requested UNAMIR and it had been authorized by the UN Security Council in Resolution 872.

UNAMIR&#x27;s effectiveness in peacekeeping was also hampered by President Habyarimana and Hutu hardliners, and by April 1994, the Security Council threatened to terminate UNAMIR&#x27;s mandate if it did not make progress. Following the death of Habyarimana, and the start of the genocide, Dallaire liaised repeatedly with both the Crisis Committee and the RPF, attempting to re-establish peace and prevent the resumption of the civil war. Neither side was interested in a ceasefire, the government because it was controlled by the genocidaires, and the RPF because it considered it necessary to fight to stop the killings. UNAMIR&#x27;s Chapter VI mandate rendered it powerless to intervene militarily, and most of its Rwandan staff were killed in the early days of the genocide, severely limiting its ability to operate.

UNAMIR was therefore largely reduced to a bystander role, and Dallaire later labelled it a &quot;failure&quot;. Its most significant contribution was to provide refuge for thousands of Tutsi and moderate Hutu at its headquarters in Amahoro Stadium, as well as other secure UN sites, and to assist with the evacuation of foreign nationals. On 12 April, the Belgian government, which was one of the largest troop contributors to UNAMIR, and had lost ten soldiers protecting Prime Minister Uwilingiliyimana, announced that it was withdrawing, reducing the force&#x27;s effectiveness even further. On 17 May 1994, the UN passed Resolution 918, which imposed an arms embargo and reinforced UNAMIR, which would be known as UNAMIR II. The new soldiers did not start arriving until June, and following the end of the genocide in July, the role of UNAMIR II was largely confined to maintaining security and stability, until its termination in 1996.

=== France and Opération Turquoise ===

During President Habyarimana&#x27;s years in power, France maintained close relations with him, as part of its &quot;Françafrique&quot; policy, and assisted Rwanda militarily against the RPF during the Civil War; France considered the RPF, along with Uganda, as part of a &quot;plot&quot; to increase Anglophone influence at the expense of French influence. During the first few days of the genocide, France launched &quot;Amaryllis&quot;, a military operation assisted by the Belgian army and UNAMIR, to evacuate expatriates from Rwanda. The French and Belgians refused to allow any Tutsi to accompany them, and those who boarded the evacuation trucks were forced off at Rwandan government checkpoints, where they were killed. The French also separated several expatriates and children from their Tutsi spouses, rescuing the foreigners but leaving the Rwandans to likely death. They rescued several high-profile members of Habyarimana&#x27;s government, as well as his wife, Agathe.

In late June 1994, France launched &quot;Opération Turquoise&quot;, a UN-mandated mission to create safe humanitarian areas for displaced persons, refugees, and civilians in danger. From bases in the Zairian cities of Goma and Bukavu, the French entered southwestern Rwanda and established the &quot;zone Turquoise&quot;, within the Cyangugu–Kibuye–Gikongoro triangle, an area occupying approximately a fifth of Rwanda. Radio France International estimates that Turquoise saved around 15,000 lives, but with the genocide coming to an end and the RPF&#x27;s ascendancy, many Rwandans interpreted &quot;Turquoise&quot; as a mission to protect Hutu from the RPF, including some who had participated in the genocide. The French remained hostile to the RPF, and their presence temporarily stalled the RPF&#x27;s advance.

A number of inquiries have been held into French involvement in Rwanda, including the 1998 French Parliamentary Commission on Rwanda, which accused France of errors of judgement, including &quot;military cooperation against a background of ethnic tensions, massacres and violence&quot;, but did not accuse France of direct responsibility for the genocide itself. A 2008 report by the Rwandan government-sponsored Mucyo Commission accused the French government of knowing of preparations for the genocide and helping to train Hutu militia members. In 2019, President Macron decided to reopen the issue of French involvement in the genocide by commissioning a new team to sort through the state archives.

In April 2021, the Rwandan government announced the study they had commissioned alleged France &quot;did nothing&quot; to prevent what they deemed the &quot;foreseeable&quot; April and May 1994 massacres in the genocide.

=== United States ===

Intelligence reports indicate that United States president Bill Clinton and his cabinet were aware before the height of the massacre that a deliberate and systematic genocide to eliminate all Tutsis was planned. Fear of a repeat of the events in Somalia shaped US policy at the time, with many commentators identifying the graphic consequences of the Battle of Mogadishu as the key reason behind the US&#x27;s failure to intervene in later conflicts such as the Rwandan genocide. After the battle, the bodies of several US casualties of the conflict were dragged through the streets of Mogadishu by crowds of local civilians and members of Aidid&#x27;s Somali National Alliance. According to the former US deputy special envoy to Somalia, Walter Clarke: &quot;The ghosts of Somalia continue to haunt US policy. Our lack of response in Rwanda was a fear of getting involved in something like a Somalia all over again.&quot; President Clinton has referred to the failure of the U.S. government to intervene in the genocide as one of his main foreign policy failings, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t think we could have ended the violence, but I think we could have cut it down. And I regret it.&quot; Eighty percent of the discussion in Washington concerned the evacuation of American citizens.

=== Arms sales to Rwanda ===
In her 2004 book, Linda Melvern documented that &quot;in the three years from October 1990, Rwanda, one of the poorest countries in the world, became the third largest importer of weapons in Africa, spending an estimated $US 112 million.&quot; She cited a significant contract with Egypt in 1992, and with France and South Africa, the next year.

Before the international embargo against Rwanda on 17 May 1994, South Africa and France were two of the main suppliers of arms to Rwanda. According to Human Rights Watch, after the embargo, they diverted their arms trade through Goma airport in Zaire. Zaire played a key role in supplying arms and facilitating arms flows to the Rwandan army. Some officials also encouraged arms trafficking by private dealers.

In 2017, according to Haaretz, Israel or Israeli private arms dealers had sold arms to the Rwandan government. Israeli officials repeatedly denied this allegation. In 2016, a petition was submitted to the Israeli Supreme Court, which ruled that the records which document Israel&#x27;s arms sales, notably to Rwanda, will remain sealed, citing section nine of Israel&#x27;s Freedom of Information Act which allows for non-disclosure if in releasing &quot;the information there is a concern over harming national security, its foreign relations, the security of its public or the security or well-being of an individual&quot;.

===Catholic Church===

Pope John Paul II expressed his deep concern about what was happening in April 1994. On 9 April, in a message to Rwandan Catholics he urged them &quot;not to give way to feelings of hatred and revenge but to courageously practice dialogue and forgiveness&quot;.

The Catholic Church affirms that genocide took place but states that those who took part in it did so without the permission of the Church. Though religious factors were not prominent, in its 1999 report Human Rights Watch faulted a number of religious authorities in Rwanda, including Catholics, Anglicans and other Protestant denominations, for failing to condemn the genocide, though that accusation was belied over time. Many other clergymen gave their lives to prevent Tutsis from being killed.

Some clergy participated in the massacres. Catholic nuns Maria Kisito and Gertrude Mukangango were convicted in 2001 of involvement in the murders of 500–700 Tutsis who had sought refuge at their convent in Sovu. Witnesses testified that they had directed a death squad to the victims&#x27; hiding place and had given them petrol with which to burn down the building. In 2006, Father Athanase Seromba was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment (increased on appeal to life imprisonment) by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda for his role in the massacre of 2,000 Tutsis. The court heard that Seromba lured the Tutsis to the church, where they believed they would find refuge. When they arrived, he ordered that bulldozers should be used to crush the refugees who were hiding inside the church and if any of them were still alive, Hutu militias should kill them all. Some in the Catholic Church&#x27;s religious hierarchy were later tried and convicted for their participation in the genocide by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. Bishop Misago was accused of corruption and complicity in the genocide, but he was cleared of all charges in 2000.

On 20 March 2017, Pope Francis acknowledged that while some Catholic nuns and priests in the country were killed during the genocide, others were complicit in it and took part in preparing and executing the genocide.

== Aftermath ==

Hutu refugees particularly entered the eastern portion of Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or DRC). Hutu &quot;genocidaires&quot; began to regroup in refugee camps along the border with Rwanda. Declaring a need to avert further genocide, the RPF-led government made military incursions into Zaire, resulting in the First (1996–97) and Second (1998–2003) Congo Wars. Armed struggles between the Rwandan government and their opponents in the DRC have continued through battles of proxy militias in the Goma region, including the M23 rebellion (2012–2013). Large Rwandan Hutu and Tutsi populations continue to live as refugees throughout the region.

===Refugee crisis, insurgency, and two Congo Wars===
Following the RPF victory, approximately two million Hutu fled to refugee camps in neighbouring countries, particularly Zaire, fearing RPF reprisals for the Rwandan genocide. The camps were crowded and squalid, and thousands of refugees died in disease epidemics, including cholera and dysentery. The camps were set up by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), but were effectively controlled by the army and government of the former Hutu regime, including many leaders of the genocide, who began rearming in a bid to return to power in Rwanda.

By late 1996, Hutu militants from the camps were launching regular cross-border incursions, and the RPF-led Rwandan government launched a counteroffensive. Rwanda provided troops and military training to the Banyamulenge, a Tutsi group in the Zairian South Kivu province, helping them to defeat Zairian security forces. Rwandan forces, the Banyamulenge, and other Zairian Tutsi, then attacked the refugee camps, targeting the Hutu militia. These attacks caused hundreds of thousands of refugees to flee; many returned to Rwanda despite the presence of the RPF, while others ventured further west into Zaire. The refugees fleeing further into Zaire were relentlessly pursued by the RPA under the cover of the AFDL rebellion and 232,000 Hutu refugees were killed, according to one estimate. The defeated forces of the former regime continued a cross-border insurgency campaign, supported initially by the predominantly Hutu population of Rwanda&#x27;s northwestern prefectures. By 1999, a programme of propaganda and Hutu integration into the national army succeeded in bringing the Hutu to the government side and the insurgency was defeated.

In addition to dismantling the refugee camps, Kagame began planning a war to remove long-time dictator Mobutu Sese Seko from power. Mobutu had supported the &quot;genocidaires&quot; based in the camps, and was also accused of allowing attacks on Tutsi people within Zaire. Together with Uganda, the Rwandan government supported an alliance of four rebel groups headed by Laurent-Désiré Kabila, which began waging the First Congo War in 1996. The rebels quickly took control of the North and South Kivu provinces and later advanced west, gaining territory from the poorly organised and demotivated Zairian army with little fighting, and controlling the whole country by 1997. Mobutu fled into exile, and Zaire was renamed the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Rwanda fell out with the new Congolese government in 1998, and Kagame supported a fresh rebellion, leading to the Second Congo War, which would last up until 2003 and caused millions of deaths and massive damage. In 2010, a United Nations (UN) report accused the Rwandan army of committing wide-scale human rights violations and crimes against humanity in the Congo during those wars, charges denied by the Rwandan government.

===Domestic situation===

The infrastructure and economy of the country had suffered greatly during the genocide. Many buildings were uninhabitable, and the former regime had carried with them all currency and moveable assets when they fled the country. Human resources were also severely depleted, with over of the population having been killed or fled. Many of the remainder were traumatised: most had lost relatives, witnessed killings or participated in the genocide. The long-term effects of war rape in Rwanda for the victims include social isolation, sexually transmitted diseases, unwanted pregnancies and babies, with some women resorting to self-induced abortions. The army, led by Paul Kagame, maintained law and order while the government began the work of rebuilding the country&#x27;s structures.

Non-governmental organisations began to move back into the country, but the international community did not provide significant assistance to the new government, and most international aid was routed to the refugee camps which had formed in Zaire following the exodus of Hutu from Rwanda. Kagame strove to portray the new government as inclusive and not Tutsi-dominated. He directed the removal of ethnicity from Rwandan citizens&#x27; national identity cards, and the government began a policy of downplaying the distinctions between Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa.

=== Justice system after genocide ===
The systematic destruction of the judicial system during the genocide and civil war was a major problem. After the genocide, over one million people (nearly one-fifth of the population remaining after the summer of 1994) were potentially culpable for a role in the genocide. The RPF pursued a policy of mass arrests for those responsible and for those persons who took part in the genocide, jailing over 100,000 people in the two years after the genocide. The pace of arrests overwhelmed the physical capacity of the Rwandan prison system, leading to what Amnesty International deemed &quot;cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment&quot;. The country&#x27;s 19 prisons were designed to hold about 18,000 inmates total, but at their peak in 1998 there were over 100,000 people in crowded detention facilities across the country.

Government institutions, including judicial courts, were destroyed, and many judges, prosecutors, and employees were murdered during the genocide. Of Rwanda&#x27;s 750 judges, 506 did not remain after the genocide—many were murdered and most of the survivors fled Rwanda. By 1997, Rwanda only had 50 lawyers in its judicial system. These barriers caused the trials to proceed very slowly: with 130,000 suspects held in Rwandan prisons after the genocide, 3,343 cases were handled between 1996 and the end of 2000. Of those defendants, 20% received death sentences, 32% received life in prison, and 20% were acquitted. It was calculated that it would take over 200 years to conduct the trials of the suspects in prison—not including the ones who remained at large.

The RPF government began the long-awaited genocide trials, which had an uncertain start at the end of 1996 and inched forward in 1997. It was not until 1996 that courts finally began trials for genocide cases with the enactment of Organic Law No. 08/96 of 30 on 30 August 1996. This law initiated the prosecution of genocide crimes committed during the genocide and of crimes against humanity from October 1990. This law established the regular domestic courts as the core mechanism for responding to genocide until it was amended in 2001 to include the Gacaca courts. The Organic Law established four categories for those who were involved in the genocide, specifying the limits of punishment for members of each category. The first category was reserved those who were &quot;planners, organizers, instigators, supervisors and leaders&quot; of the genocide and any who used positions of state authority to promote the genocide. This category also applied to murderers who distinguished themselves on the basis of their zeal or cruelty, or who engaged in sexual torture. Members of this first category were eligible for the death sentence.

While Rwanda had the death penalty prior to the 1996 Organic law, in practice no executions had taken place since 1982. Twenty-two individuals, including Froduald Karamira, were executed by firing squad in public executions in April 1998. After this, Rwanda conducted no further executions, albeit it continued to issue death sentences until 2003. On 25 July 2007 the Organic Law Relating to the Abolition of the Death Penalty came into law, abolishing capital punishment and converting all existing death sentences to life in prison under solitary confinement. In parallel, the 2007 UN resolution presented and campaigns continued for a global moratorium on capital punishment.

=== Gacaca courts ===
In response to the overwhelming number of potentially culpable individuals and the slow pace of the traditional judicial system, the government of Rwanda passed Organic Law No. 40/2000 in 2001. This law established Gacaca Courts at all administrative levels of Rwanda and in Kigali. It was mainly created to lessen the burden on normal courts and provide assistance in the justice system to run trials for those already in prison. The least severe cases, according to the terms of Organic Law No. 08/96 of 30, would be handled by these Gacaca Courts. With this law, the government began implementing a participatory justice system, known as Gacaca, to address the enormous backlog of cases. The Gacaca court system traditionally dealt with conflicts within communities, but it was adapted to deal with genocide crimes. Among the principal objectives of the courts were identification of the truth about what happened during the genocide, speeding up the process of trying genocide suspects, national unity and reconciliation, and demonstrating the capacity of the Rwandan people to resolve their own problems.

The Gacaca court system faced many controversies and challenges; they were accused of being puppets of the RPF-dominated government. The judges (known as Inyangamugayo, which means &quot;those who detest dishonesty&quot; in Kinyarwanda) who preside over the genocide trials were elected by the public. After election, the judges received training, but there was concern that the training was not adequate for serious legal questions or complex proceedings. Furthermore, many judges resigned after facing accusations of participating in the genocide; 27% of them were so accused. There was also a lack of defense counsel and protections for the accused, who were denied the right to appeal to ordinary courts. Most trials were open to the public, but there were issues with witness intimidation. The Gacaca courts did not try those responsible for massacres of Hutu civilians committed by members of the RPF, which controlled the Gacaca Court system.

On 18 June 2012, the Gacaca court system was officially closed after facing criticism. It is estimated that the Gacaca court system tried 1,958,634 cases during its lifetime and that 1,003,227 persons stood trial.

=== International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda ===

Meanwhile, the UN established the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), based in Arusha, Tanzania. The UN Tribunal tried high-level members of the government and armed forces, while Rwanda prosecuted lower-level leaders and local people.

Since the ICTR was established as an ad hoc international jurisdiction, the ICTR was scheduled to close by the end of 2014, after it would complete trials by 2009 and appeals by 2010 or 2011. Initially, the U.N. Security Council established the ICTR in 1994 with an original mandate of four years without a fixed deadline and set on addressing the crimes committed during the Rwandan genocide. As the years passed, it became apparent that the ICTR would exist long past its original mandate. With the announcement of its closing, there was a concern over how residual issues would be handled, because &quot;The nature of criminal judicial work ... is such that it never really ends.&quot; The ICTR officially closed on 31 December 2015, and its remaining functions were handed over to the Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals.

=== Censorship ===

Article 38 of the Constitution of Rwanda 2003 guarantees &quot;the freedom of expression and freedom of access to information where it does not prejudice public order, good morals, the protection of the youth and children, the right of every citizen to honour and dignity and protection of personal and family privacy&quot;. This has not guaranteed freedom of speech or expression given that the government has declared many forms of speech fall into the exceptions. Under these exceptions, longtime Rwandan president, Paul Kagame, asserted that any acknowledgment of the separate people was detrimental to the unification of post-Genocide Rwanda and has created numerous laws to prevent Rwandans from promoting a &quot;genocide ideology&quot; and &quot;divisionism&quot;. The law does not explicitly define such terms, nor does it state that one&#x27;s beliefs must be spoken. For example, the law defines divisionism as &quot;the use of any speech, written statement, or action that divides people, that is likely to spark conflicts among people, or that causes an uprising which might degenerate into strife among people based on discrimination&quot;. Fear of the possible ramifications from breaking these laws have caused a culture of self-censorship within the population. Both civilians and the press typically avoid anything that could be construed as critical of the government/military or promoting &quot;divisionism&quot;.

Under the Rwandan constitution, &quot;revisionism, negationism and trivialisation of genocide&quot; are criminal offences. Hundreds of people have been tried and convicted for &quot;genocide ideology&quot;, &quot;revisionism&quot;, and other laws ostensibly related to the genocide. According to Amnesty International, of the 489 individuals convicted of &quot;genocide revisionism and other related crimes&quot; in 2009, five were sentenced to life imprisonment, five were sentenced to more than 20 years in jail, 99 were sentenced to 10–20 years in jail, 211 received a custodial sentence of 5–10 years, and the remaining 169 received jail terms of less than five years. Amnesty International has criticized the Rwandan government for using these laws to &quot;criminalize legitimate dissent and criticism of the government&quot;. In 2010, Peter Erlinder, an American law professor and attorney, was arrested in Kigali and charged with genocide denial while serving as defense counsel for presidential candidate Victoire Ingabire.

=== Survivors ===
The number of Tutsi survivors of the genocide has been debated. Different figures between 150,000 and 309,368 have been offered. There are a number of organizations representing and supporting these survivors of the genocide. These include the Survivors Fund, IBUKA and AVEGA. The 2007 report on the living conditions of survivors conducted by the Ministry of Social Affairs in Rwanda reported the following situation of survivors in the country:

== Media and popular culture ==
Canadian Lieutenant-General Roméo Dallaire became the best-known eyewitness to the genocide after co-writing the book &quot;Shake Hands with the Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda&quot; (2003) describing his experiences with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Dallaire&#x27;s book was made into the movie &quot;Shake Hands with the Devil&quot; (2007). Former journalist and United States Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power is interviewed about the Rwandan genocide in &quot;Watchers of the Sky&quot; (2014), a documentary by Edet Belzberg about genocide throughout history and its eventual inclusion in international law.

The critically acclaimed and multiple Academy Award-nominated film &quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot; (2004) is based on the experiences of Paul Rusesabagina, a Kigali hotelier at the Hôtel des Mille Collines who sheltered over a thousand refugees during the genocide. The independent documentary film &quot;Earth Made of Glass&quot; (2010), which addresses the personal and political costs of the genocide, focusing on Rwandan President Paul Kagame and genocide survivor Jean-Pierre Sagahutu, premiered at the 2010 Tribeca Film Festival.

HBO Films released the made-for-television historical drama film titled Sometimes in April in 2005.

In 2005, Alison Des Forges wrote that eleven years after the genocide, films for popular audiences on the subject greatly increased the &quot;widespread realization of the horror that had taken the lives of more than half a million Tutsi&quot;. In 2007, Charlie Beckett, Director of POLIS, said: &quot;How many people saw the movie &quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot;? [It is] ironically the way that most people now relate to Rwanda.&quot;

The song &quot;Papaoutai&quot; was released by Belgian-Rwandan singer Stromae in 2013, and was inspired by loss of the singer&#x27;s father in the Rwandan genocide.

== Commemoration ==
In March 2019, President Félix Tshisekedi of the Democratic Republic of the Congo visited Rwanda to sign the Kigali Genocide Memorial Book, saying, &quot;The collateral effects of these horrors have not spared my country, which has also lost millions of lives.&quot; On 7 April the Rwandan Government initiated 100 days of mourning in observation of the 25th anniversary of the genocide by lighting a flame at the Kigali Genocide Memorial. Dignitaries from Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Niger, Belgium, Canada, Ethiopia, the African Union and the European Union attended. At the national level, the annual commemoration programs are known as Kwibuka and commence with an official week of mourning observed from 7 to 13 April, known as Icyunamo. During this period, work is suspended, and various events take place locally, nationally, and among the Rwandan diaspora across the globe. These events provide opportunities for survivors to share their testimonies, fostering remembrance and reflection on the tragic events that occurred.

<text>Night Watch is a 1973 mystery thriller film directed by Brian G. Hutton from a screenplay by Tony Williamson, based on the 1972 play of the same name by Lucille Fletcher. The film reunited Elizabeth Taylor with co-star Laurence Harvey from their 1960 collaboration &quot;BUtterfield 8&quot;. It was the last time the pair acted together on screen. Some of the story elements recall the plot outline of the 1944 film &quot;Gaslight&quot;.

==Plot==
In London, during a raging thunderstorm one night, Ellen Wheeler frantically tells her husband, John, that from the living-room window, she has seen a man with his throat slit in a chair by the window in the large, old, deserted house across the way. John calls the police, but a search of the old house finds no evidence of a murder.

The next morning, Ellen notices a freshly planted bed of &quot;Laburnum&quot; in the garden next to the old house that was not there before. She calls the investigating detective, Inspector Walker, and suggests that the body of the murder victim she witnessed may be buried there. Inspector Walker questions the neighbour, Mr. Appleby, who confirms that he planted the trees the night before during the storm, but refuses to let the police search the garden or dig up the trees.

Ellen is recovering from a nervous breakdown that occurred after her unfaithful first husband, Carl, was killed a few years earlier in an auto accident with his young paramour, while suffering from recurring nightmares of the accident. After learning that Ellen has called Inspector Walker multiple times about the investigation, John suggests that she see his psychiatrist friend, Tony. Indignant, Ellen continues to insist that she saw a murder in the deserted house, but since there is no proof, John remains sceptical.

Ellen&#x27;s visiting friend Sarah Cooke is equally sceptical, suggesting that Ellen sees what she thinks she sees because of her recent breakdown. That night, when both Ellen and Sarah see a light moving behind the old house&#x27;s shutters, they call the police, who discover Mr. Appleby wandering around with a flashlight and arrest him for trespassing. A second search of the house and excavation of the garden reveal nothing, and Inspector Walker privately tells John that the case is officially closed.

That evening, Ellen claims to John and Sarah that she saw another body in the old house, that of a woman. Ellen is then sedated by John and Sarah, who believe that Ellen may be losing her mind. The next day, Ellen agrees to see Tony and, during their conversation, recounts Carl&#x27;s fatal car accident. Tony advises her to check into a clinic in Switzerland for a few weeks, to which Ellen agrees. Shortly afterwards, Ellen calls Inspector Walker and urges him to search the old house again. After falsely promising to do so, he reveals that the house was purchased six months earlier by a private company, DIPCO.

The following evening, as Ellen prepares to depart for Switzerland, John asks her to sign several financial documents, including one that grants him power of attorney over their financial holdings. She complies, after noticing in the documents that John had recently acquired DIPCO. Ellen angrily accuses John and Sarah of having an affair and plotting to torment her in order to have her committed, showing him the key to the old house. When John denies Ellen&#x27;s accusations, she runs to the old house and lets herself inside using the key; John and Sarah both chase after her. Ellen lures the two to the second-floor room where she claimed to have seen the bodies. There, she slashes John&#x27;s throat and stabs Sarah to death, before positioning them in exactly the same manner that she claimed to have seen the two bodies.

It is revealed that Ellen had feigned insanity by claiming to have witnessed two murders in the old house as part of an elaborate scheme to murder both John and Sarah for their affair, and to weary the police with her repeated phone calls in order to dissuade them from investigating the house and finding the bodies of John and Sarah. Mr. Appleby, whose father owned John and Ellen&#x27;s house before they purchased it, makes a surprise visit, startling Ellen and congratulating her on pulling off her scheme. He assures her that he does not intend to report the murders, as Inspector Walker would not believe him. Ellen asks Mr. Appleby to look after her house and the garden until she returns. Mr. Appleby happily agrees as Ellen bids him goodbye and departs.

==Cast==

==Production==
&quot;Night Watch&quot; was based on the play of the same name by Lucille Fletcher, starring Joan Hackett. The play opened in February 1972. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a most excellent thriller... a first class example of its genre&quot;.

Film rights to the play were bought prior to the play reaching Broadway by producer Martin Poll. He set up the film at Brut Productions, a newly formed film division of the Fabergé Company, run by George Barrie. It was one of the first films from that company. Poll said, &quot;It&#x27;s really a lot more now than a suspense story. It deals with the relationship between people torn by their emotions, their betrayals and jealousies.&quot;

It was decided to relocate the story to England. The film was shot at Elstree Studios in London. Brut financed the film entirely, with Taylor taking a smaller salary in exchange for a larger percentage. Director Brian G. Hutton had just made &quot;X Y &amp; Zee&quot; (1972) with Taylor. Harvey&#x27;s casting was announced in April 1972. Barrie would later finance Harvey&#x27;s last film, &quot;Welcome to Arrow Beach&quot; (1974).

Filming was interrupted several times. It shut down for a week when Hutton contracted bronchitis, and then later for six more weeks so Harvey could have an operation on his stomach. Harvey said at the time that the operation was due to appendicitis, but it was in fact stomach cancer, which would kill him shortly after the picture was released. Filming wrapped in September 1972.

Although Barrie and John Cameron composed the musical score of the film, and Cameron was credited for it, the background music for a significant part of the film is Brahms&#x27; Piano Concerto No. 2 and Schubert&#x27;s Unfinished Symphony.

In February 1973, Avco Embassy agreed to distribute the film along with another Brut Production, &quot;A Touch of Class&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Time Out&quot; called it a &quot;tired, old-fashioned thriller&quot;; whereas &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Elizabeth Taylor, and about time, has got herself a good picture and a whodunit at that&quot;; and &quot;Variety&quot; opined, &quot;Lucille Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;Night Watch&quot; isn&#x27;t the first average stage play to be turned into a better than average film. Astute direction and an improved cast more than help&quot;.

<text>BBC Look East is a BBC regional television news service for the East of England, produced by BBC East.

==History==

The first BBC television news bulletins for the East of England began at 6.05pm on 5 October 1959. These new bulletins, launched three weeks ahead of the launch of regional ITV station Anglia Television were initially ten minutes long.

The bulletin was extended to twenty minutes in September 1962 and renamed &quot;East Anglia at Six&quot;, and then a year later renamed &quot;East at Six Ten&quot; due to a change in timeslot. Another change in timeslot saw it renamed as &quot;Look East&quot; from 28 September 1964, although that evening&#x27;s programme failed to go out due to a breakdown and &quot;Look East&quot; instead began on September 29.

&quot;Look East&quot; is broadcast from BBC East&#x27;s headquarters at The Forum, Norwich. Prior to 29 September 2003, the programme aired from studios in St Catherine&#x27;s Close, Norwich.

The programme can be watched in any part of the UK (and Europe) on Sky Digital channel 961 &quot;east&quot; and channel 962 for the &quot;west&quot; sub-regional service from Cambridge, or Freesat channels 953 (East) and 954 (West), on the BBC UK regional TV on satellite service. The services were added to the Sky Digital platform on 29 July 2003 and were available on Freesat from launch.

Some areas that are well covered by &quot;Look East&quot; receive better television signals from other transmitters in other regions on Freeview. Most of Southend and parts of Chelmsford, Luton and Stevenage receive better television signals from the Crystal Palace transmitter which broadcast &quot;London News&quot; and viewers in King’s Lynn, Hunstanton and Wells-next-the-Sea get better signals from the Belmont TV transmitter that broadcast &quot;Look North&quot;. 

However, those areas are given &quot;Look East&quot; on Channel 101 through satellite television such as Freesat as default via the towns&#x27; postcodes.

In 1997, &quot;BBC Look East&quot; launched the sub-regional service, &quot;Close Up&quot;, for viewers covered by the Sandy Heath transmitting station and its relays. The opt-out allowed the two sub-regions to provide, during the main evening programme, around 10 minutes of news relevant to their area.

From 2018 to 2022, there were two separate editions of &quot;BBC Look East&quot;, for the main programme and the late news bulletin on weeknights:
*BBC Look East - East which covered Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex
*BBC Look East - West which covered Cambridgeshire, Peterborough, Bedfordshire, Milton Keynes (Buckinghamshire), Northamptonshire, parts of Hertfordshire.

At the end of the 18:30 programme on 30 September 2021, Stewart White announced his retirement from the BBC after 37 years as a main presenter of &quot;Look East&quot;.

The West edition was broadcast from Cambridge, originally at the existing Hills Road studios for BBC Radio Cambridgeshire near the city centre and railway station, then from 2009 at the new BBC Cambridgeshire building at Cambridge Business Park near Cambridge North railway station.

On 26 May 2022 it was announced that following BBC cost-cutting measures the separate West edition of the programme would end, which it did in December 2022. The Cambridge TV studio closed, with all broadcasts from that point returning to their pre-1997 region-wide format, broadcast from the existing studios in Norwich. The Oxford edition of &quot;South Today&quot; was also scrapped.

==Broadcast times==
On weekdays, &quot;BBC Look East&quot; broadcasts six three-minute opt-outs during &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot; at 27 and 57 minutes past each hour. A fifteen-minute lunchtime programme follows at 13:30 before the main 27-minute edition at 18:30. A seven-minute late update is shown at 22:30, following the &quot;BBC News at Ten&quot;.

&quot;BBC Look East&quot; also airs three bulletins during the weekend: two early evening bulletins on Saturday and Sunday and a late night bulletin on Sundays, following the &quot;BBC News at Ten&quot;. The times of these bulletins usually vary.

From 2008 until 2018, the BBC One 8pm News Summary was a bulletin derived from the BBC Three &quot;60 Seconds&quot; format, delivered across all BBC regions including &quot;BBC Look East&quot; with a separate set of paired presenters.

It was significant for younger audiences according to the BBC: &quot;For 1.7 million viewers the 8pm summary was the only BBC TV News they saw in that week with nearly 600,000 in the 16-34 year old bracket.&quot;

The regular 8pm presenters included Janine Machin, Claudia Liza-Armah, and Mike Cartwright, with the last 8pm broadcast from Cambridge and all BBC regions on Wednesday 30 May 2018.

<doc id="676663" wikidata="Q2976664" url="?curid=676663" title="John Robertson (footballer, born 1964)">
<text>John Grant Robertson (born 2 October 1964) is a Scottish professional football coach and former player whose position was striker. His playing career included spells at Newcastle United, Dundee and Livingston, but he is best known for his two spells at Heart of Midlothian totalling about 18 years, where he is the club&#x27;s all-time leading goalscorer. He has since managed Inverness Caledonian Thistle, Hearts, Ross County, Livingston, Derry City and East Fife.

==Playing career==
Hibernian attempted to sign Robertson as a teenager but he asked for time to think the deal over; after Hibs refused, he signed for Heart of Midlothian along with school friend and fellow future internationalist Dave Bowman. Robertson eventually earned the moniker &quot;The Hammer of Hibs&quot; (in addition to his more standard nickname &quot;Robbo&quot;) as he scored a record 27 goals in Edinburgh derby matches. In 1986, 20 league goals from Robertson helped Hearts to the brink of a league and cup double. A 27 league game unbeaten run ended with two Albert Kidd goals for Dundee in the last six minutes of the season allowing Celtic to overtake them to win the title. A week later, Hearts lost 3–0 to Aberdeen in the cup final. He scored 106 goals in 202 Hearts league games in this spell at Tynecastle Park.

He left Hearts to play for Newcastle United in April 1988. Robertson failed to score in 14 Newcastle competitive first team games and returned to Hearts in December of that year, and remained there for the next decade. In 1998 Hearts won the Scottish Cup with Robertson an unused substitute, earning him his only senior medal as a player. In this second spell at Hearts he scored at a much less prolific rate compared to his first spell, with this time 106 goals in 310 league games. After an earlier loan spell with Dundee scoring once in 4 league games, he left Tynecastle that summer. He joined Livingston as a player-coach, scoring 14 goals in 41 league games.

Robertson was also a Scottish international, playing on 16 occasions for Scotland. He made his debut against Romania in 1990, scoring in a 2–1 win. He missed out on selection for the UEFA Euro 1992 due to a hernia injury.

==Coaching career==
===Inverness Caledonian Thistle (first spell)===
Whilst playing for Livingston, Robertson became involved in the coaching side of the game. He left the club in season 2002–03 to become manager of Inverness Caledonian Thistle where he guided the Highland team to the SPL for the first time in their history.

===Heart of Midlothian manager===
In November 2004 he returned to Hearts as head coach and despite two cup semi-finals and a good season in Europe as well as finishing fifth in the league, he was sacked in May 2005.

===Ross County and Livingston===
Robertson was appointed manager of Scottish First Division team Ross County in June 2005, but left by mutual consent after four months. He was then appointed manager of Livingston in February 2006, but was sacked in April 2007 after finishing sixth in the First Division.

===Derry City===
Robertson was appointed by League of Ireland side Derry City in July 2007. He took club out of the relegation battle to a safe mid table position and also won the FAI League Cup and qualified for the Setanta Cup before being dismissed by the new chairman and board of directors at Derry, and replaced by former Derry boss Stephen Kenny. In 2009, Robertson coached strikers at Scottish Premier League clubs Dundee United and Kilmarnock. In March 2010, Robertson helped coach the strikers at Hearts on a non-contract basis.

===East Fife===
Robertson was appointed manager of East Fife in October 2010. In September 2011, his East Fife side knocked SPL club Aberdeen out of the Scottish League Cup at Pittodrie Stadium. On 1 March 2012 it was announced that Robertson had left East Fife.

===Inverness Caledonian Thistle (second spell)===
In June 2017, Robertson returned to Inverness Caledonian Thistle as manager. On 24 March 2018, the club won the Scottish Challenge Cup. In the 2018/19 season, Inverness qualified for the promotion playoffs but were beaten in the semi-finals by Dundee United. Dundee then made an approach for Robertson, but this was rejected by Inverness. Inverness finished second in the 2019–20 Scottish Championship, which was curtailed due to the coronavirus pandemic.

In June 2020, his contract with Inverness was extended by two years. Robertson was placed on compassionate leave in February 2021, with Neil McCann given caretaker charge of the team in his absence. Robertson returned to Inverness in May 2021 as sporting director, with a new manager to be appointed (Billy Dodds). Dodds was sacked in September 2023, and Robertson was placed in caretaker charge of the Inverness first team until Duncan Ferguson was appointed later that month. He left the club in November that same year.

<text>John Neilson Robertson (born 20 January 1953) is a Scottish former professional footballer. He provided the assisting cross for Trevor Francis to score the only goal when Nottingham Forest won the 1979 European Cup Final. A year later he scored when Forest retained the trophy 1-0 this time against Hamburger SV. At Forest he also won promotion from the 1976–77 Football League Second Division, the 1977–78 Football League First Division, the UEFA Super Cup, two Football League Cups, the 1978 FA Charity Shield and the Anglo-Scottish Cup.

He also played for the full Scotland national football team, scoring the winning goal against England in 1981 and against New Zealand in the 1982 FIFA World Cup.

He has since moved into coaching, acting as assistant to his former Nottingham Forest teammate Martin O&#x27;Neill. Robertson&#x27;s last role was assistant manager at Aston Villa between 2006 and 2010.

==Playing career==
===Nottingham Forest (first spell)===
Robertson had played for Scotland at Schoolboy and Youth levels and for Drumchapel Amateurs before joining Forest in May 1970, making his debut for the team in October 1970. Although he was an infrequent member of the first team as a midfielder up to 1975, and was on the transfer list when Clough became manager, Robertson became a key player as a left winger under Clough and appeared in 243 consecutive games between December 1976 and December 1980. He scored the winning goal, a penalty, for Forest in the 1978 Football League Cup Final replay against Liverpool. He also scored the winner in the 1980 European Cup Final against Hamburg and provided the cross for the winning goal in the 1979 European Cup Final, scored by Trevor Francis, against Malmö FF.

Brian Clough, Robertson&#x27;s manager at Nottingham Forest, was quoted as saying 
&quot;John Robertson was a very unattractive young man. If one day, I felt a bit off colour, I would sit next to him. I was bloody Errol Flynn in comparison. But give him a ball and a yard of grass, and he was an artist, the Picasso of our game.&quot; In his autobiography Clough noted that &quot;Rarely could there have been a more unlikely looking professional athlete... [He was a] scruffy, unfit, uninterested waste of time...but something told me he was worth persevering with.&quot; but that &quot;[He] became one of the finest deliverers of a football I have ever seen – in Britain or anywhere else in the world – as fine as the Brazilians or the supremely gifted Italians.&quot; Robertson&#x27;s captain at Forest, John McGovern, later said that &quot;John Robertson was like Ryan Giggs but with two good feet, not one. He had more ability than Ryan Giggs, his ratio of creating goals was better and overall he was the superior footballer&quot;, whilst Forest coach Jimmy Gordon rated Robertson as a better player than Tom Finney and Stanley Matthews, saying that he &quot;had something extra on top&quot;.

===Later playing career===
Robertson was sold to Derby County in June 1983 on a contested transfer (the fee was set by a tribunal) that soured the relationship between Clough and his former assistant Peter Taylor, but was injured soon after joining the team and failed to reproduce the form he had shown when he played for Forest. Although he rejoined Forest on a free transfer in August 1985, he remained well below his former best and moved to non-league Corby Town at the end of the 1985/86 season. He also had stints with Stamford and Grantham Town.

==Coaching career==
After retiring from playing, Robertson has been variously chief scout and assistant manager to former Nottingham Forest teammate Martin O&#x27;Neill at Wycombe Wanderers, Norwich City, Leicester City, Celtic and Aston Villa.

==Legacy==
Robertson was voted into first place in a 2015 poll by the &quot;Nottingham Post&quot; of favourite all-time Nottingham Forest players.

==Personal life==
Robertson&#x27;s daughter, Jessica, was born in 1983 with cerebral palsy, which left her quadriplegic and unable to speak or control her movements. She had a short life expectancy. In 1994, Robertson and his former wife Sally challenged the hospital where Jessica was born for damages, claiming that they had caused her brain damage by a 12-hour delay to carry out a Caesarean section. However, they lost their High Court case.

Robertson&#x27;s other daughter Liz appeared on the first ever episode of BBC&#x27;s quiz show &quot;TNL: Who Dares Wins&quot; in 2007.

Robertson released his autobiography &quot;Supertramp&quot; in September 2012. He supported Rangers as a boy, but describes his time at Celtic as assistant to Martin O&#x27;Neill as the best years of his life in football.

Robertson suffered a suspected heart attack while playing tennis with former Forest teammate Liam O&#x27;Kane on 23 August 2013. Fans of Celtic, Derby County, Leicester City and Nottingham Forest took to social network sites to wish him well.

<doc id="676669" wikidata="Q2601198" url="?curid=676669" title="Alleyway (video game)">
<text>is a 1989 video game developed by Nintendo and Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo as a global launch title for the Game Boy. It is a &quot;Breakout&quot; clone and one of the first four games developed and released for the system. The game was released first in Japan in 1989, in North America later that year, and in Europe in 1990. It was later re-released for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console in June 2011, and on the Nintendo Switch Online service in May 2024.

The name &quot;Alleyway&quot; references the in-game gateway that the player&#x27;s spaceship (represented as a paddle) must pass through. While &quot;Alleyway&quot; is a portable clone of &quot;Breakout&quot;, it adds several features, including alternating stages, bonus rounds, and hazards for the player at later levels. While the game&#x27;s original box art featured an unidentifiable protagonist, later international releases of the game replaced the character with Mario. &quot;Alleyway&quot; was released with limited advertising, receiving moderate to low scores from reviewers who compared it to games like &quot;Arkanoid&quot;.

==Gameplay==
The player&#x27;s objective in &quot;Alleyway&quot; is to clear all bricks in each stage using a ball and paddle while keeping the ball from falling into the pit below, similar to that of &quot;Breakout&quot;. The paddle&#x27;s speed can be adjusted by holding either the B or A button on the controller while moving the paddle, which can move only horizontally at a fixed height. At the start of each life, the player can reposition the paddle before releasing the ball and commencing gameplay. When released, the ball will always begin at a 45° angle above the paddle aimed toward its center. The player starts the game with five paddles; each time the ball falls into the pit below the paddle, a paddle is removed and the ball is reset.

The game ends when all the player&#x27;s paddles are depleted. An additional paddle is granted for every 1000 points scored until the player has over 10,000 points. The player may have up to nine paddles at once. The game lacks a continue feature, though the high score will be retained until the game is reset or turned off. As there is no battery-backed SaveRAM or password feature, &quot;Alleyway&quot; can only be completed in one sitting on the Game Boy. This was later changed with the re-release of the game for the Nintendo 3DS&#x27;s Virtual Console system, which allowed for in-game progress to be recorded to a single save state accessible at any time while playing the game.

===Ball behavior===
The ball will only travel at 15°, 30°, or 45° angles. If the ball hits a brick, the brick disappears and the ball ricochets in a different direction at the same angle. The ball&#x27;s speed depends on the type of brick that it hits: gray and black bricks increase its speed, while white and square, indestructible bricks have no effect. A sound effect is also played when the ball collides with an object or wall, with walls producing the lowest pitch and black bricks the highest.

The ball&#x27;s direction and speed can be controlled by the paddle&#x27;s velocity and point of contact. Changing direction the moment the ball comes into contact with the paddle, called a &quot;snap technique&quot;, will bounce the ball upward with increased speed. Moving the paddle quickly in the opposite direction than the ball is headed will result in the ball bouncing in the same horizontal direction as the paddle at a 15° angle. If the player contacts the ball with the body of the paddle before it falls into the pit below, it will bounce back into the playing field. However, if instead, either corner of the paddle collides with the ball at that moment, it will be knocked directly into the pit.

&quot;Alleyway&quot;″s ball cannot be locked in an infinite loop of ricochets. Whenever the ball starts to loop between objects such as the ceiling, indestructible blocks and/or the paddle itself, its velocity will change at a random point after the second cycle on its next collision. As a result, the ball will travel at a slightly raised or lowered angle depending on its current trajectory, and will break out of the loop.

===Levels===

The game features 24 levels, based on eight block patterns in groups of three. After every three regular stages, the player proceeds to a bonus stage, giving the game a total of 32 levels. Most levels follow a generic design, though one group is modeled after Mario&#x27;s head as it appears next to the remaining paddles icon. The player progresses to the next level once all bricks are destroyed, where the same pattern of bricks appears but behaves differently. Every second stage is a &quot;Scrolling Block Screen&quot;, featuring bricks that move from left to right; every third is an &quot;Advancing Block Screen&quot;, where the bricks move downward the height of one regular brick in short bursts, increasing in speed as the ball bounces off the paddle. Any part of a brick below a height of ten bricks above the paddle is automatically removed; thus they cannot impede the player&#x27;s movement but cannot contribute towards the player&#x27;s score either.

As the player progresses through patterns, new elements are added to the gameplay. After the fourth stage, if the ball comes into contact with the top of the area, the paddle&#x27;s size is halved until the stage is cleared or a life is lost. From this point on, the third stage variant features hidden bricks above the ceiling that descend progressively, using a similar—or same—layout that must also be cleared, meaning the pattern must be cleared twice. In later levels, bricks in the second stage variant may not move at the same speed or in the same direction. After the twelfth stage, indestructible bricks are incorporated into the brick patterns.

Bonus stages feature patterns based on various Nintendo Entertainment System &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; sprites, such as a Piranha Plant, Goomba or Bowser. Unlike regular levels, the ball will destroy blocks in these stages without ricocheting off them, and contact with the ceiling will not affect the paddle size. These stages are the only ones to feature background music during play, and cannot be paused. A timer is present for each bonus stage; it starts at 95 for the first and is reduced by five for each subsequent bonus stage completed beforehand. If the timer ends, the ball falls into the pit (no life is lost in this case), or all bricks are destroyed, the bonus stage ends. Destroying all bricks before the timer expires yields additional bonus points, which vary depending on the level. Once cleared, the brick pattern changes and gameplay reverts to the normal cycle. After finishing the final bonus round, the player is given a congratulations screen using the Mario graphic from the original &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; game. The game then loops back to the first stage, allowing for infinite play.

===Scoring===
Points are awarded for destroying bricks based on their shade, with one point awarded for the lightest and three for the darkest. The player may earn additional points for completing the bonus stages, with the bonus starting at 500 for the first and reaching 1500 for the last five. The player&#x27;s highest obtained score is recorded until the game is turned off.

The game only displays four digits of the player&#x27;s score, yet it has a maximum value of 65,535. Scores of 10,000 and above are displayed as a combination of icons and the numerical display. For every 10,000 points, a sprite from the NES &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; game is shown below the numerical score. A fire flower is shown for 10,000 points, a mushroom for 20,000, and a starman for 30,000 points and above. The game stops changing the sprite after awarding the starman icon. As a result, the highest score that can be displayed is 39,999, but the maximum score of 65,535 is shown as 35,535. Once the maximum score has been reached, the score will roll over only if the player completes a bonus stage. A rollover does not affect the recorded high score.

==Development==
Based on classic ball-and-paddle arcade games such as &quot;Breakout&quot; and &quot;Arkanoid&quot;, &quot;Alleyway&quot; was a launch title for the Game Boy in 1989 for Japan and North America, alongside &quot;Super Mario Land&quot;, &quot;Baseball&quot;, and &quot;Tetris&quot;, though only with the first two in Japan. The game&#x27;s release predates &quot;Tetris&quot;″ by two months, due to legal battles between Nintendo and Tengen over the Tetris property. On June 6, 2011, the game was re-released as a launch title for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console system via online distribution. It was first released in Japan, and then North America a year later.

&quot;Alleyway&quot; marks one of the first appearances of Mario on the Game Boy system alongside &quot;Super Mario Land&quot;, although its original box and cartridge art showed an unidentified character in a spacesuit piloting the paddle. The artwork was changed to show Mario at the controls on the game&#x27;s international release, but neither the manual nor the back of the box refer to the Nintendo mascot&#x27;s presence in the game. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;″s preview made no mention of Mario in the title other than note of the pattern of bricks in Mario&#x27;s shape for the first bonus level. Official confirmation of the pilot being Mario only came about in 1990 with &quot;Club Nintendo&quot;″s preview of the game&#x27;s European release.

The game was one of the first titles made by the Nintendo R&amp;D1 development team, alongside &quot;Tetris&quot; and &quot;Radar Mission&quot;. Years later, the game&#x27;s designer Gunpei Yokoi would reuse much of &quot;Alleyway&quot;″s source code (such as paddle behavior and adapted physics engine) for the Game Boy game &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Block Ball&quot; while working with Shigeru Miyamoto&#x27;s team. &quot;Alleyway&quot; was re-released for download onto the Nintendo Power cartridge, occupying one memory block on the device.

Promotion of the title in Nintendo published material consisted of a segment taking up a third of the page the articles were on. Advertisements for &quot;Alleyway&quot; were grouped with those for the Game Boy itself and other titles for the system. Years after its initial release, a two-page section in the &quot;Super Game Boy Nintendo Strategy Guide&quot; bundled with the &quot;Super Game Boy&quot; accessory appeared, which gave advice and color codes for the game.

==Reception==

Although &quot;Alleyway&quot; sold well enough during its production run, it has not been re-released as a Nintendo Player&#x27;s Choice title, and reviews of the game have been mostly mixed. &quot;Mean Machines&quot; gave the game a score of 33%, criticizing its repetitiveness and stating &quot;this variant doesn&#x27;t have much more to offer than the original [&quot;Breakout&quot;]&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s staff added &quot;once you&#x27;ve finished a couple of screens, you&#x27;ll be bored stiff&quot; and compared the game to its predecessor, &quot;Arkanoid&quot;, regarding the lack of power-ups in &quot;Alleyway&quot;. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; staff also reviewed the game, with four separate reviews giving the game scores of 6/10, 6/10, 5/10, and 3/10. All four reviewers compared it to &quot;Arkanoid&quot;, complaining about the lack of enhancement over the &quot;Breakout&quot; format. &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; shared the sentiment in their review of the 3DS re-release, with reviewer Nathan Meunier giving it a score of 5/10 and stating that &quot;&quot;Alleyway&quot; wasn&#x27;t so hot when it first came out, and it still pales when put it side-by-side to other similarly priced offerings&quot;. He further added at times the game appeared to &quot;hate&quot; the player with its difficulty, though acknowledged that the addition of save states &quot;takes some of the sting out of losing&quot;. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;″s Darran Jones called it &quot;pretty piss-poor all the way back in 1989&quot;, noting the bland levels and lack of power-ups found in &quot;Arkanoid&quot;, and that many similar clones had outperformed it.

Not all comments about the game have been negative. The two &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; reviewers that gave the highest scores did state they felt the design was perfect for the Game Boy, one adding: &quot;It&#x27;s also a very good game that combines some new features ... with the original Break-Out theme&quot; and concluding &quot;&quot;Alleyway&quot; is good—but a bit long&quot;. German magazine &quot;Power Play&quot; gave the game a rating of 48%, but also praised the game&#x27;s level variety. The book &quot;Rules of Play&quot; discusses the game as an example of improved design over a base core mechanic, citing the inclusion of distinct sound effects for ball collision as a means to praise the player for destroying bricks, and the varied level designs as &quot;well done&quot; and giving the player &quot;an element of discovery to the overall experience&quot;. &quot;AllGame&quot; noted that despite the simplicity and variety, &quot;&quot;Alleyway&quot; is fun to play&quot;, further adding that games of its kind &quot;always play well on the Game Boy&quot;.
