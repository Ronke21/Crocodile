<text>Solihull School is a coeducational private day school in Solihull, West Midlands, England. Founded in 1560, it is the oldest school in the town and is a member of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference.

== History ==
In 1560 the revenues of the chantry chapels of St Mary and St Katherine in the parish church of St Alphege, Solihull were diverted for the endowment of a school for boys. The revenue of the chapel of St Alphege was added to the fund six years later, enhancing the capacity of the school. The education remained based in teachings of the Church and the desire to turn out &#x27;respectable, thoughtful, successful young gentlemen&#x27;.

In the 17th century it became a boarding school and the number of pupils grew. The school became more notable and well thought of owing to the involvement of several prominent families. Much of this development came under the Headmastership of the Rev. Richard Mashiter who, in 1735, was famously elected ahead of Samuel Johnson, a celebrated author, essayist, and lexicographer. Johnson was passed over because the school&#x27;s directors thought he was &quot;a very haughty, ill-natured gent., and that he has such a way of distorting his fface [sic] (which though he can&#x27;t help) the gent[s] think it may affect some lads in the pursuit of learning&quot;. The successful applicant Mashiter was, by marriage, related to the aristocratic Holbeche family and his daughter married John Short, a well-respected surgeon in Solihull who would go on to serve the school as a Feoffee for 57 years. Short&#x27;s six sons were all educated at Solihull School and became professionally and socially successful. One of them, Robert Short, rose to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the army of the East India Company and later became 54th Lord of The Manor of Solihull. Owing to a strong affection for Solihull School he expressly recommended it to his fellow officers and peers, according to the diaries of Caroline Clive.

In around 1879 the feoffees were replaced by a board of Governors who allowed £4,345 to be made available for an architect, J. A. Chatwin, to be commissioned to build a new school on a new site for 80 day boys and 20 boarders. Upon the building&#x27;s completion in 1882, the school relocated to the new site on the Warwick Road from its previous location on the edge of Brueton Park. &#x27;School House&#x27; is now a grade II listed building. Expansion continued on this Warwick Road site into the 20th century. Over the course of the 20th century the school grew steadily from 200 to nearly 1000 pupils.

In 1960 a new chapel was built and was named &quot;The Chapel of St Mary and St Katherine&quot; to commemorate the origins of the school.

In 1962 the school was visited by Queen Elizabeth II.

In the early 1970s the school admitted girls into the Sixth Form for the first time. Only ten girls joined in the first year, but this grew quickly over the following years, until 2002 when for the first time as many girls entered the Sixth Form as did boys.

In September 2005 the school began a transition to becoming fully co-educational, at first admitting girls into all four years of the Junior School and at 11+ level, beginning a process which was completed in 2009, when the first third form (year 7) girls reached upper fifth (year 11). The 2015-2016 academic year marked the first girls to go through the whole school from J1 to upper sixth.

In 2010 Solihull School celebrated its 450th anniversary. Both the school and the Old Silhillians&#x27; Association hosted a range of ceremonial, musical and sporting events to mark the historic occasion.

A sapling taken from the tree that Anne Frank could see from her hiding place in Amsterdam was planted at Solihull School as part of Remembrance Day commemorations 2015. The tree was planted by 86-year-old Auschwitz survivor Mindu Hornick – at an age similar to what Anne Frank would have been. The tree was the idea of Holly Krober (Pole, 2005-2016), who was so moved by her Solihull School trip to Auschwitz concentration camp with 3 other pupils that she was determined to commemorate the victims of the Holocaust.

In 2020 Solihull School merged with nearby girls school St Martins School. Today the former St Martins Campus houses the Prep School.

== Facilities ==
The school is based across two campuses. Solihull Senior School on the Warwick Road campus currently occupies a site of approximately . This is partly as a result of a former headmaster, Warin Foster Bushell, who in the 1920s bought much of the land himself when the governors refused to finance the purchase out of school funds. On his retirement Bushell sold the fields to the school at no profit. The school&#x27;s quadrangle and surrounding classrooms, as well as the former hall, known as Big School, were built after this period, and were followed by a chapel and large teaching block and sports hall, amongst other additions. Solihull School has a number of rugby pitches, cricket squares and nets, tennis courts, football pitches and general purpose sports fields. There is a floodlit artificial pitch on the school&#x27;s main campus, incorporating 2, 8x40 warm-up areas. The pitch is used primarily for hockey in the winter months and in the summer term the pitch affords a further 8 tennis courts and a multi-purpose training/coaching area.

One mile away, at Copt Heath, the school has another of fields, comprising 4 rugby pitches, a new floodlit artificial pitch and a cricket square. These are a part of the site that is home to the school&#x27;s former pupils&#x27; organisation, the Old Silhillians&#x27; Association.

The school possesses a mountain cottage in Snowdonia, North Wales. The cottage was presented to the school in 1958 by the parents of David Fricke, who was a school pupil between 1946-1956, following his death. David was a keen mountain walker and it was felt that the cottage would be a fitting tribute to his memory. Most pupils will visit the cottage as part of Snowdonia School in the shell forms. Those taking part in CCF or the Duke of Edinburgh award scheme may also use this facility on other occasions.

In 1990 a building was constructed to house the junior school. This was followed by the extension of the science laboratories in 1995; the renovation of most classrooms, in 1998; and the conversion of Big School into a library, and the construction of a new hall and theatre building, completed in 2002, named the Bushell Hall after the former headmaster. A new pavilion was constructed in 2003, named the Alan Lee Pavilion after another former headmaster (1983–1996) who died shortly after its completion.

Opened in September 2005, a building provides fifteen new teaching rooms for the classics, history, economics and business studies, religious studies and IT departments. There is also a multi-purpose teaching room and a social area. It has been named the George Hill building after a governor of the school who died shortly before its completion. George Hill&#x27;s business acumen helped secure the school&#x27;s financial position throughout the 20th century.

In 2007, the governors of the school commissioned a new music school to be built for the 450th anniversary of the school. Building work started on the music school in 2008 with it scheduled for completion in 2010. It was later named the David Turnbull Music School, after a former director of music.

Building of a new sixth form centre - The Cooper Building - commenced in the summer of 2014 and completed in 2015. In November 2019 Solihull opened its newly refurbished refectory. In September 2019 Solihull announced its merger with Saint Martin&#x27;s School from September 2020. Solihull Preparatory School (aged 3 – 11) is located on the Saint Martin&#x27;s campus and Solihull Senior School (11 – 18 years) on the Warwick Road campus.

There are over 1,500 pupils, 440 at Solihull Preparatory School on the Saint Martin&#x27;s campus and 1,100 in Solihull Senior School on the Warwick Road campus.

== School houses ==

* Fetherston (Gold) – named after Barnaby Fetherston who was the first usher of the school; a post that today would be called deputy master. Fetherston was instrumental in obtaining donations of land from Henry Hugford, Thomas Dabridgecourt, Thomas Waring and Thomas Greswolde. The later three have their arms incorporated in the school badge.
* Jago (Maroon) – named after 18th-century poet and Old Silhillian Richard Jago. Jago went to University College, Oxford and then returned to Warwickshire, eventually entering the clergy.
* Pole (Sky blue) – named after the school&#x27;s first headmaster.
* Shenstone (Black) – named after 18th-century poet, Old Silhillian, classmate and lifelong friend of Jago, William Shenstone. Shenstone went to Pembroke College, Oxford and then returned home to manage his family&#x27;s estate. On sporting occasions they are often referred to as the &#x27;All Blacks&#x27;, owing to their black shirts.
* Windsor (Royal blue) – created in 1959 as a mark of respect to the royal family. Shortly afterwards, in 1960 and 1962, the school received two royal visits; from The Duchess of Kent and Queen Elizabeth II respectively.

== School structure ==
The School is divided into sections. These form the basis of the pastoral structure of the school.

Solihull Preparatory School (Saint Martin&#x27;s campus)

*Nursery
*Reception
*Infants - I1 and I2
*Junior School – J1, J2, J3, J4 (academic years 3, 4, 5, 6)
Solihull Senior School (Warwick Road campus)
*Lower School – Thirds, Shells, Fourths (7, 8, 9)
*Middle School – Lower Fifth, Upper Fifth (10, 11)
*Upper School – Lower Sixth, Upper Sixth (12, 13)

== Prefectorial system ==
Pupils are selected by members of staff to hold positions of responsibility within the various sections of the school. They are, in the senior school, known as &quot;benchers&quot;. Details of the different benches are listed below in descending seniority:

*Heads of school – After a detailed interview process, the staff will select one male and one female member of the upper sixth to be head boy and head girl. 
*The school bench – School benchers are selected by means of a poll of their peers and members of staff at the end of their lower sixth year. They are responsible for the behaviour of pupils in the refectory; general behaviour and standards of other pupils; and giving tours of the school to parents of prospective pupils. Although they cannot, nowadays, directly give detentions, they can refer pupils who may be deserving of punishment to a house master. They are the only pupils in the school who are allowed to walk across the grass in the Great Quadrangle; all others must walk around the paved perimeter. They are denoted by virtue of wearing a small, maroon rosette on the left lapel.
*Middle school bench – Middle school benchers are members of the upper fifth and are selected by members of staff. They wear a &quot;cabbage&quot; similar to that of the senior &quot;school benchers&quot;, but dark green rather than maroon.
*Lower school – Lower school benchers are selected from the fourth form and wear a blue &quot;cabbage&quot;.
*Junior school – &quot;Monitors&quot; are selected from members of J4 and wear an enamel badge on the left lapel of the blazer. Their responsibilities are limited to the confines of the junior school.

Each section of the school has a head boy and head girl. The head boy and girl of upper school are known as &quot;heads of school&quot;.

== Sport ==
The campus covers an area of approximately and this includes rugby pitches, cricket squares, football pitches, an all-weather pitch, all-weather training areas, tennis courts, squash courts, Athletics facilities (running track and jumps/throws areas), climbing wall, rifle range, an indoor swimming pool and two gymnasiums.

Boys&#x27; games
*Rugby union is the main competitive team sport and is played from the age of 11 onwards. The first XV traditionally play in a dark blue jersey with narrow, horizontal white and maroon stripes, white shorts and dark blue, maroon and white socks. The striped jersey has, in recent years, been swapped for a maroon shirt with blue sleeves. The teams have recently done well nationally, the first XV having won the Daily Mail Vase Cup in 2011 at Twickenham, which is the furthest the school has ever reached. Solihull School regularly produces players who attain representative honours at county level and beyond. The &quot;Big Side&quot; teams tour biennially to, amongst other countries, Australia, South Africa, Canada and New Zealand. In 2014, the school&#x27;s senior rugby squad toured South Africa. The U15 age group travel to Italy or France each year to play against several club sides. Solihull School also plays rugby sevens, competing at national tournaments such as The National Schools Sevens at Rosslyn Park, Blackpool Sevens and Fylde Sevens. The &quot;Old Boys&quot; fixture is always an anticipated and contested event, with many pupils, Old Silhillians and parents turning out to watch the current XV compete against a selection of Old Silhillians. The match, held in early December, is usually preceded by a barbecue and followed by drinks, speeches and presentations in the Alan Lee pavilion.
*Hockey is also a sport. The first XI have scored victories over Rugby School and Warwick School, both of which are local rivals, advancing through the rounds of the regional and national cup competitions in the process.
*Football has recently been adopted into the curriculum in the senior school and the 1st XI compete in the ISFA.
*Cricket has produced players who have represented Warwickshire CCC at first-class level. Both batsmen and bowlers from Solihull School have been cited in the Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack for their performance over the course of a season. The school&#x27;s recently formed Twenty20 team, who play in an all red kit, compete at various Twenty20 schools&#x27; tournaments around the country.
*Athletics – The school provides representatives for the Solihull Borough athletics team, as well and the West Midlands and Midlands teams. Daniel Caines, former world champion indoor 400 m runner, is an Old Silhillian.

Girls&#x27; games
*Hockey is the main winter sport for girls. The team competes in regional and national competitions. The Solihull School kit consists of maroon or white tops, navy blue skirts and socks.
*Rounders is played in the summer and the first team play schools from across the country. The team plays in a blue skirt and white polo shirt. A picnic is held for the upper sixth pupils on the afternoon of the last game of the season.
*Netball has a 1st and 2nd team competing during the summer term. The teams play in identical kits to that of the rounders team.
*Athletics. The squad travel to, and compete at many of the same competitions as the boys. The girls do not take part in as many invitational meetings as the boys&#x27; team.

Sports as such golf, shooting (both clay pigeon and rifle shooting), swimming, cross country, sailing, tennis, squash, and badminton are all played within the school and teams are put forward to compete against other schools. Other sports include basketball, lacrosse, and water polo.

School colours
*school colours have been bestowed upon Solihull School pupils who have represented the school at a high level in their chosen sport. The reward takes the form of a dark blue blazer with narrow red and white vertical stripes. These may be worn instead of the standard plain blue blazer or suit jacket.

Since 2006 it has been possible for those pupils who have achieved in debating, leadership, drama, music or community service to also be awarded school colours. When a pupil achieves school colours, they get a silver school crest that goes on the breast pocket. Those achieving &quot;double colours&quot; get a gold crest to replace the silver.

== Music and drama ==
The school has a music society. There are three orchestras, a big band and instrumental groups and choirs. These range from traditional wind and string ensembles to African and Samba percussion groups.

Both the music and drama departments are able to use the Bushell Hall for performances. This building is used as an assembly hall and has a retractable stage with under-stage orchestra pit and seats an audience of around 1,000.

== School publications ==
*&quot;The Shenstonian&quot; is the school&#x27;s annual publication and reviews the academic, sporting and other events within the school. It chronicles the achievements of pupils and publishes works of arts, poetry and prose. The editor is a member of staff. It is named, as is one of the houses, after the notable poet and Old Silhillian William Shenstone.
*&quot;The Silhillian&quot; is the annual magazine of the Old Silhillians&#x27; Association. It includes news of the school, messages from the committee, news of former pupils, reminiscences of School, news of the Old Silhillian sports clubs and obituaries of Old Silhillians and former teachers.

<doc id="681635" wikidata="Q775369" url="?curid=681635" title="Neapolitan chord">
<text>In Classical music theory, a Neapolitan chord (or simply a &quot;Neapolitan&quot;) is a major chord built on the lowered (flat) second (supertonic) scale degree. In Schenkerian analysis, it is known as a Phrygian II, since in minor scales the chord is built on the notes of the corresponding Phrygian mode. The Neapolitan is found far more often in minor keys than in major keys.

Although it is sometimes indicated by an &quot;N&quot; rather than a &quot;II&quot;, some analysts prefer the latter because it indicates the relation of this chord to the supertonic. The Neapolitan chord does not fall into the categories of mixture or tonicization. Moreover, even Schenkerians like Carl Schachter do not consider this chord as a sign for a shift to the Phrygian mode. Therefore, like the augmented sixth chords it should be assigned to a separate category of chromatic alteration.

In European Classical music, the Neapolitan most commonly occurs in first inversion so that it is notated either as II6 or N6 and normally referred to as a Neapolitan sixth chord. In B major or B minor, for example, a Neapolitan sixth chord in first inversion contains an interval of a minor sixth between E and C.

The Neapolitan sixth chord is an idiom specific to classical music. Other music traditions often feature II harmonies (ex. C major chord in the keys of B major or B minor), but usually in root position. These are sometimes referred to as &quot;Neapolitan&quot; chords, but these rarely follow the classical voice-leading and chord functions described below. For examples and discussion, see Tritone substitution, or the section &quot;In popular music&quot; below.

==Origin of the name==

Especially in its most common occurrence (as a triad in first inversion), the chord is known as the &quot;Neapolitan sixth&quot;:
* The chord is called &quot;Neapolitan&quot; because it is associated with the Neapolitan School, which included Alessandro Scarlatti, Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, Giovanni Paisiello, Domenico Cimarosa, and other important 18th-century composers of Italian opera. But it seems already to have been an established, if infrequent, harmonic practice by the end of the 17th century, used by Giacomo Carissimi, Arcangelo Corelli, and Henry Purcell.
* It is called a &quot;sixth&quot; because the interval between the bass note and the root of the chord is a minor sixth. For example, in the key of C major or C minor the chord consists of D (the root note), F (the third of the triad), and A (the fifth of the triad) – with the F in the bass, to make it a II6 rather than a root-position II. The interval of a minor sixth is between F and D.

== Harmonic function ==
In tonal harmony, the function of the Neapolitan chord is to prepare the dominant, substituting for the IV or ii (particularly ii6) chord. For example, it often precedes an authentic cadence, where it functions as a type of subdominant (IV). In such circumstances, the Neapolitan sixth is a chromatic alteration of the subdominant, and it has an immediately recognizable and poignant sound.
For example, in B major, the IV (subdominant) triad in root position contains the notes E, G, and B. By lowering the G by a semitone to G and raising the B to C, the Neapolitan sixth chord E–G–C is formed.

In B minor, the resemblance between the subdominant (E-G-B) and the Neapolitan (E-G-C) is even stronger since only one note differs by a half-step. (The Neapolitan is also only a half-step away from the diminished supertonic triad in minor in first inversion, E-G-C, and thus lies chromatically between the two primary subdominant function chords.)
The Neapolitan sixth chord is particularly common in minor keys. As a simple alteration of the subdominant triad (iv) of the minor mode, it provides contrast as a major chord compared to the minor subdominant or the diminished supertonic triad.

===Further harmonic contexts===
A common use of the Neapolitan chord is in tonicizations and modulations to different keys. It is the most common means of modulating down a semitone, which is usually done by using the I chord in a major key as a Neapolitan chord (or a flattened major supertonic chord in the new key, a semitone below the original).

Occasionally, a minor seventh or augmented sixth is added to the Neapolitan chord, which turns it into a potential secondary dominant that can allow tonicization or modulation to the V/IV key area relative to the primary tonic. Whether the added note were notated as a minor seventh or augmented sixth largely depends on how the chord resolves. For example, in B major or B minor, the Neapolitan chord with an augmented sixth (A added to C major chord) very likely resolves in B major or minor, or possibly into some other closely related key such as F major.

However, if the extra note is considered an added seventh (B), this is the best notation if the music is to lead into F major or minor.

Another such use of the Neapolitan is along with the German augmented sixth chord, which can serve as a pivot chord to tonicize the Neapolitan as a tonic (). In C major/minor, the German augmented sixth chord is an enharmonic A7 chord, which could lead as a secondary dominant to D, the Neapolitan key area. As the dominant to II, the A7 chord can then be respelled as a German augmented sixth, resolving back to the home key of C major/minor.

== Minor Neapolitan chord ==

Sometimes one encounters a minor triad on the Neapolitan second degree rather than the major: for example, a D minor chord in the key of C major or C minor. Sometimes this is enharmonically respelled as occurring on the sharpened tonic, i.e. a C minor chord in C major or C minor. This has the same function as the major Neapolitan but is considered more expressive.

== Voice leading ==

Because of its close relationship to the subdominant, the Neapolitan sixth resolves to the dominant using similar voice-leading. In the present example of a C major/minor tonic, the D generally moves down by two steps to the leading tone B (creating the expressive melodic interval of a diminished third, one of the few places this interval is accepted in traditional voice-leading), while the F in the bass moves up by step to the dominant root G. The fifth of the chord (A) usually resolves down a semitone to G as well. In four-part harmony, the bass note F is generally doubled, and this doubled F either resolves down to D or remains as the seventh F of the G-major dominant seventh chord. In summary, the conventional resolution is for all upper voices to move down against a rising bass.

Care must be taken to avoid consecutive fifths when moving from the Neapolitan to the cadential. The simplest solution is to avoid placing the fifth of the chord in the soprano voice. If the root or (doubled) third is in the soprano voice, all upper parts simply resolve down by step while the bass rises. According to some theorists, however, such an unusual consecutive fifth (with both parts descending a semitone) is allowable in chromatic harmony, so long as it does not involve the bass voice. (The same allowance is often made more explicitly for the German augmented sixth, except in that case it may involve the bass – or &quot;must&quot;, if the chord is in its usual root position.)
== Inversions ==

The II chord is sometimes used in root position (in which case there may be even more concessions regarding consecutive fifths, similar to those just discussed). The use of a root position Neapolitan chord may be appealing to composers who wish for the chord to resolve outwards to the dominant in first inversion; the flattened supertonic moves to the leading tone (in C major, D to B) and the flattened submediant may move down to the dominant or up to the leading tone (A to either G or B).
In very rare cases, the chord occurs in second inversion; for example, in Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;, in the aria &quot;Rejoice greatly&quot;. This occurs in measure 61, where the Bb in the bass with an E♭ major chord above it is a second-inversion Neapolitan chord within the D-minor key of the aria&#x27;s B section.

== In classical music ==

From the early 17th century onwards, composers became aware of the expressive power of the Neapolitan chord, especially to convey moments of intense feeling.

=== Baroque period ===

In his oratorio &quot;Jephte&quot;, Giacomo Carissimi portrays the grief-stricken tears (&quot;lachrimate&quot;) of Jephtha’s daughter and her companions at the prospect of her brutal fate. According to Richard Taruskin, &quot;The daughter&#x27;s lament... makes especially affective use of the ‘Phrygian’ lowered second degree at cadences, producing what would later be called the Neapolitan (or ‘Neapolitan sixth) harmony.&quot; (B in the key of A minor).

In his opera &quot;King Arthur&quot;, Henry Purcell features the chord (D in the key of C minor) among a range of &quot;daring chromatic harmonies&quot; and &quot;strange sliding semitones&quot; to evoke the sensation of intense cold in Act 3 Scene 2, when the spirit of Winter, the awe-inspiring &quot;Cold Genius&quot; is aroused from its slumbers. 

In contrast to Purcell, the opening movement of &quot;Summer&quot; from Vivaldi’s &quot;The Four Seasons&quot;, &quot;a four-note descent transformed by Neapolitan-sixth harmony&quot; enhances the sensation of weariness and languor under the hot sun (A in the key of G minor). As the sonnet accompanying the music puts it:

Paul Everett describes the above passage as &quot;a set of disarmingly &#x27;slow&#x27; gestures, metrically dislocated, that must represent the lethargy of the anxious man as much as the oppressive heat of an airless day.&quot;
In J.S. Bach’s &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot;, No. 19, the episode conveying Christ&#x27;s agony in the garden of Gethsemane, the Neapolitan chord (G in the key of F minor) is used on the word &quot;Plagen&quot; (torments) in the chorale harmonization sung by the chorus:
According to John Eliot Gardiner, &quot;The answering soft-voiced chorus... imbues [the music] with a mysterious quality, almost as though a muted drama is taking place at a distance from the main action – Christ&#x27;s ‘Agony in the Garden’ and his acceptance of his role as Saviour.&quot;

=== Classical period ===
The Neapolitan chord was a favourite idiom among composers in the Classical period. In his Piano Sonata in C minor, &quot;a masterpiece of tragic power,&quot; Haydn uses the chord (D in the key of C minor) as he brings the opening statement of his first subject to a close: Haydn makes more extended use of this chord in the finale of the sonata to powerful and dramatic effect:

Ludwig van Beethoven used the Neapolitan chord frequently in some of his best-known works, including the opening of his &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot;, Op. 27 No. 2:
Wilfrid Mellers sees the apparent tranquillity of these bars as &quot;deceptive, since in bar 3 the bass&#x27;s F sharp is harmonized not as a subdominant but, with the quaver triplet&#x27;s D flattened as a first inversion of the Neapolitan chord of D major. The implied progression from D natural to the cadential B sharp delivers a small stab to the nervous system.&quot;

Beethoven’s &quot;Appassionata&quot; Sonata, Op. 57 uses the Neapolitan chord on a broader harmonic canvas. Both the first and last movements of the sonata open with a phrase repeated a semitone higher (G in the key of F minor).

Other examples of Beethoven&#x27;s use of the chord occur in the opening bars of String Quartet op. 59 No.2, String Quartet op. 95, and the third movement of the &quot;Hammerklavier&quot; Sonata.
A powerful example from Schubert comes in his single movement Quartett-Satz (1820). The opening &quot;has a dramatic intensity... which is all the more powerful because it begins quietly.&quot; The passage culminates in a Neapolitan chord (D in the key of C minor): According to Roger Scruton, &quot;It is as though a spirit had arisen out of the turbulent clouds and suddenly burst forth into the light – the clouds formed from the key of C minor, the spirit itself, released at last, being in the negation of C minor, namely D flat major.&quot; Scruton sees the &quot;semitone conflict&quot; that recurs in different keys as the movement progresses as a unifying feature that has &quot;penetrated the whole structure of the piece.&quot;

=== Romantic period ===
In the fourth scene of Richard Wagner’s opera &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;, the earth Goddess Erda prophesies the impending doom of the Gods. Wagner&#x27;s orchestration here juxtaposes two significant dramatic leitmotifs, the one ascending to represent Erda and the other, &quot;a descending variant of Erda&#x27;s motive played over a chord of the Neapolitan sixth&quot; with the intention of conveying their ultimate downfall to ominous and chilling effect. (D in the key of C minor):

==In popular music==
In rock and pop music, II chords often occur in root position and with non-classical voice-leading. Examples include:
*Alexander Rybak&#x27;s and Paula Seling&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Show You&quot;
*Badfinger&#x27;s &quot;Come and Get It&quot;
*The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Do You Want to Know a Secret&quot;
*The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Because&quot;
*Jacques Brel&#x27;s &quot;Ne me quitte pas&quot; (later adapted into English as &quot;If You Go Away&quot; and covered by various artists)
*Livin&#x27; Joy&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Movin&#x27;&quot;
*Robin Thicke&#x27;s &quot;Fall Again&quot; 
*The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Mother&#x27;s Little Helper&quot;
*Joanna Newsom&#x27;s &quot;Colleen&quot; on the line &quot;surf a-pounding&quot; and other places
*In Brazilian popular music as in Noel Rosa&#x27;s &quot;Último desejo&quot; and in several Chico Buarque&#x27;s songs

<text>The Slovak Football Association (, SFZ) is the governing body of Association football in Slovakia. The association has the responsibility for the control and development of football in Slovakia, and is the body that runs the Slovakia national football, and futsal teams.

==History==
The Slovak Football Association was founded on 4 November 1938 and originally became a member of FIFA in 1939, but disbanded after World War II because Czech and Slovak football competitions were combined, and so did the national teams. Following the breakup of Czechoslovakia, the organization was reformed, joining UEFA in 1993, and rejoined FIFA in 1994.

The Slovak Football Association runs the Slovakia national football team, as well as male youth teams at under-21, under-19, under-18, under-17, under-16, and under-15 level. The association also organizes the Slovakia women&#x27;s national football team and the Slovakia national futsal team.

<text>Jacques Pelletier du Mans, also spelled Peletier (, 25 July 1517 – 17 July 1582) was a humanist, poet and mathematician of the French Renaissance.

==Life==
Born in Le Mans into a bourgeois family, he studied at the Collège de Navarre in Paris, where his brother Jean was a professor of mathematics and philosophy. He subsequently studied law and medicine, frequented the literary circle around Marguerite de Navarre and from 1541 to 1543 he was secretary to René du Bellay. In 1541 he published the first French translation of Horace&#x27;s and during this period he also published numerous scientific and mathematical treatises.

In 1547 he produced a funeral oration for Henry VIII of England and published his first poems (), which included translations from the first two cantos of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; and the first book of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Georgics&quot;, twelve Petrarchian sonnets, three Horacian odes and a Martial-like epigram; this poetry collection also included the first published poems of Joachim Du Bellay and Pierre de Ronsard (Ronsard would include Jacques Pelletier into his list of revolutionary contemporary poets (). He then began to frequent a humanist circle around Théodore de Bèze, Jean Martin, Denis Sauvage.

In the Renaissance, the French language had acquired many inconsistencies in spelling through attempts to model French words on their Latin roots (see Middle French). Pelletier tried to reform French spelling in his 1550 treatise (&quot;Dialogue on French spelling and pronunciation&quot;), advocating a phonetic-based spelling using new typographic signs which he would continue to use in all his published works. In this system, he consistently spells his name with one &quot;l&quot;: .

Pelletier was principal of the Collège de Bayeux and subsequently spent many years in Bordeaux, Poitiers, Piedmont (where he may have been the tutor of the son of Maréchal de Brissac), and Lyon (where he frequented the poets and humanists Maurice Scève, Louise Labé, Olivier de Magny and Pontus de Tyard). In 1555 he published a manual of poetic composition, , a Latin oration calling for peace from King Heney II and Emperor Charles V, and a new collection of poetry, (consisting of a sonnet cycle and a series of encyclopedic poems describing meteors, planets and the heavens), which would influence that poets Guillaume du Bartas and Jean-Antoine de Baïf.

His last years were spent in travels to the Savoy, Germany, Switzerland, possibly Italy and various regions in France and in publishing numerous works in Latin on algebra, geometry and mathematics and medicine (including a refutation of Galen and a work on the plague). In 1572, he was briefly director of the College of Aquitaine in Bordeaux, but, bored by the position, he resigned. During this period, he was friends with Michel de Montaigne and Pierre de Brach. In 1579, he returned to Paris and was named director of the College of Le Mans. A final collection of poetry &quot;Louanges&quot; was published in 1581.

Pelletier died in Paris in July or August 1582.

While maintaining the original system of the French mathematician Nicolas Chuquet (1484) for the names of large numbers, Jacques Pelletier promoted &quot;milliard&quot; for 1012 which had been used earlier by Budaeus. In the late 17th century, &quot;milliard&quot; was subsequently reduced to 109. This convention is used widely in long scale countries.

<text>In the ADM formulation of general relativity, spacetime is split into spatial slices and a time axis. The basic variables are taken to be the induced metric formula_1 on the spatial slice and the metric&#x27;s conjugate momentum formula_2, which is related to the extrinsic curvature and is a measure of how the induced metric evolves in time. These are the metric canonical coordinates.

In 1986 Abhay Ashtekar introduced a new set of canonical variables, Ashtekar (new) variables to represent an unusual way of rewriting the metric canonical variables on the three-dimensional spatial slices in terms of an SU(2) gauge field and its complementary variable.

==Overview==
Ashtekar variables provide what is called the connection representation of canonical general relativity, which led to the loop representation of quantum general relativity and in turn loop quantum gravity and quantum holonomy theory.

Let us introduce a set of three vector fields formula_3 formula_4 that are orthogonal, that is,

:formula_5

The formula_6 are called a triad or &quot;drei-bein&quot; (German literal translation, &quot;three-leg&quot;). There are now two different types of indices, &quot;space&quot; indices formula_7 that behave like regular indices in a curved space, and &quot;internal&quot; indices formula_8 which behave like indices of flat-space (the corresponding &quot;metric&quot; which raises and lowers internal indices is simply formula_9). Define the dual &quot;drei-bein&quot; formula_10 as

:formula_11

We then have the two orthogonality relationships

:formula_12

where formula_13 is the inverse matrix of the metric formula_14 (this comes from substituting the formula for the dual &quot;drei-bein&quot; in terms of the &quot;drei-bein&quot; into formula_15 and using the orthogonality of the &quot;drei-beins&quot;).

and

:formula_16

(this comes about from contracting formula_17 with formula_18 and using the linear independence of the formula_19). It is then easy to verify from the first orthogonality relation, employing formula_20 that

:formula_21

we have obtained a formula for the inverse metric in terms of the &quot;drei-beins&quot;. The &quot;drei-beins&quot; can be thought of as the &#x27;square-root&#x27; of the metric (the physical meaning to this is that the metric formula_22 when written in terms of a basis formula_23 is locally flat). Actually what is really considered is

:formula_24

which involves the &quot;densitized&quot; &quot;drei-bein&quot; formula_25 instead &quot;densitized&quot; as formula_26. One recovers from formula_27 the metric times a factor given by its determinant. It is clear that formula_27 and formula_29 contain the same information, just rearranged. Now the choice for formula_27 is not unique, and in fact one can perform a local in space rotation with respect to the internal indices formula_31 without changing the (inverse) metric. This is the origin of the formula_32 gauge invariance. Now if one is going to operate on objects that have internal indices one needs to introduce an appropriate derivative (covariant derivative), for example the covariant derivative for the object formula_33 will be

:formula_34

where formula_35 is the usual Levi-Civita connection and formula_36 is the so-called spin connection. Let us take the configuration variable to be

:formula_37

where formula_38 and formula_39 The densitized &quot;drei-bein&quot; is the conjugate momentum variable of this three-dimensional SU(2) gauge field (or connection) formula_40 in that it satisfies the Poisson bracket relation

:formula_41

The constant formula_42 is the Immirzi parameter, a factor that renormalizes Newton&#x27;s constant formula_43 The densitized &quot;drei-bein&quot; can be used to re construct the metric as discussed above and the connection can be used to reconstruct the extrinsic curvature. Ashtekar variables correspond to the choice formula_44 (the negative of the imaginary number, formula_45), formula_46 is then called the chiral spin connection.

The reason for this choice of spin connection, was that Ashtekar could much simplify the most troublesome equation of canonical general relativity – namely the Hamiltonian constraint of LQG. This choice made its formidable second term vanish, and the remaining term became polynomial in his new variables. This simplification raised new hopes for the canonical quantum gravity programme. However it did present certain difficulties: Although Ashtekar variables had the virtue of simplifying the Hamiltonian, it has the problem that the variables become complex. When one quantizes the theory it is a difficult task to ensure that one recovers real general relativity, as opposed to complex general relativity. Also the Hamiltonian constraint Ashtekar worked with was the densitized version, instead of the original Hamiltonian; that is, he worked with formula_47

There were serious difficulties in promoting this quantity to a quantum operator. In 1996 Thomas Thiemann who was able to use a generalization of Ashtekar&#x27;s formalism to real connections (formula_42 takes real values) and in particular devised a way of simplifying the original Hamiltonian, together with the second term. He was also able to promote this Hamiltonian constraint to a well defined quantum operator within the loop representation.

Lee Smolin &amp; Ted Jacobson, and Joseph Samuel independently discovered that there exists in fact a Lagrangian formulation of the theory by considering the self-dual formulation of the tetradic Palatini action principle of general relativity. These proofs were given in terms of spinors. A purely tensorial proof of the new variables in terms of triads was given by Goldberg and in terms of tetrads by Henneaux, Nelson, &amp; Schomblond (1989).

<text>Giuseppe Felice Romani (31 January 178828 January 1865) was an Italian poet and scholar of literature and mythology who wrote many librettos for the opera composers Donizetti and Bellini. Romani was considered the finest Italian librettist between Metastasio and Boito.

==Biography==
Born Giuseppe Felice Romani to a bourgeois family in Genoa, he studied law and literature in Pisa and Genoa. At the University of Genoa he translated French literature and, with a colleague, prepared a six-volume dictionary of mythology and antiquities, including the history of the Celts in Italy. Romani&#x27;s expertise in French and antiquity is reflected in the libretti he wrote; the majority are based on French literature and many, such as &quot;Norma&quot;, use mythological sources.

After refusing a post at the University of Genoa, he appears to have travelled to France, Spain, Greece and Germany before returning to Milan in either 1812 or 1813. There he became friends with important figures in the literary and musical world. He turned down the post of court poet in Vienna, and began instead a career as an opera librettist. He wrote two librettos for the composer Simon Mayr, which resulted in his appointment as the librettist for La Scala. Romani became the most highly regarded of all Italian librettists of his age, producing nearly one hundred. In spite of his interest in French literature, he refused to work in Paris.

Romani wrote the librettos for Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Il pirata&quot;, &quot;La straniera&quot;, &quot;Zaira&quot;, &quot;I Capuleti e i Montecchi&quot;, &quot;La sonnambula&quot;, &quot;Norma&quot; and &quot;Beatrice di Tenda&quot;, for Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Il turco in Italia&quot; and &quot;Bianca e Falliero&quot;, and Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Anna Bolena&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot; (which he adapted from Eugène Scribe&#x27;s &quot;Le philtre&quot;). He also wrote a libretto (originally for composer Adalbert Gyrowetz) that Verdi used for his early comedy &quot;Un giorno di regno&quot;.

Romani was considered an ideal match for Bellini, who is quoted as having said: &quot;Give me good verses and I will give you good music&quot;. Dramatic, even extravagant &quot;situations&quot; expressed in verses &quot;designed to portray the passions in the liveliest manner&quot; was what Bellini was looking for in a libretto, according to a letter to Francesco Florimo, of 4 August 1834, and he found them in Romani.

The two, however, had a falling out over missed deadlines for &quot;Beatrice di Tenda&quot;. After setting &quot;I puritani&quot; to a libretto by Carlo Pepoli, Bellini was determined not to compose any more Italian operas with anyone but Romani. &quot;I puritani&quot; was his last opera; he died less than a year after its première. Romani mourned him deeply and wrote an obituary in which he expressed his profound regrets over their disagreement.

In 1834 Romani became editor of the &quot;Gazzetta Ufficiale Piemontese&quot; to which he contributed literary criticism. He retained the post, with a break from 1849–1854, until his death, in Moneglia, (in the region of Liguria, Italy). A volume of his lyric poems was published in 1841.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Whalley was born in Salford, Lancashire, and later moved to Levenshulme and then to Stockport, Greater Manchester. There, she attended Bredbury Comprehensive School, before leaving to study at Harrytown Convent Girls&#x27; School in Romiley and the Braeside School of Speech and Drama in Marple. As a child actress, from 1974 to 1979, Whalley made a number of television appearances including bit parts in popular soap operas &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and &quot;Emmerdale&quot;.

She made her feature film debut as a young Beatles fan in Richard Marquand&#x27;s biographical film, &quot;Birth of the Beatles&quot; (1979) and flirted with the fringes of the Manchester new wave scene by briefly being a member of a Stockport-based band called the Slowguns, but left before the release of the first of their two singles later that year. Her television work continued with early appearances in episodes of popular series including &quot;Juliet Bravo&quot; and &quot;The Gentle Touch&quot;.

From 1982 to 1986 she studied and performed with the Royal Court Theatre starting at the 1982 Young Writers&#x27; Festival by originating the role of Rita in Max Stafford-Clark&#x27;s first production of Andrea Dunbar&#x27;s &quot;Rita, Sue and Bob Too&quot;. That same year she made a non-speaking appearance as a groupie in Alan Parker&#x27;s musical drama &quot;Pink Floyd – The Wall&quot; (1982), featured in Stan Barstow&#x27;s well-received TV series &quot;A Kind of Loving&quot; (Granada, 1982) and starred as Gilly Brown alongside Trevor Eve in Danny Boyle&#x27;s production of &quot;The Genius&quot; at the Royal Court Theatre.

At this time, she was also the lead singer of the pop group Cindy &amp; The Saffrons; they recorded the Shangri-Las&#x27; song &quot;Past, Present and Future&quot; in 1982 at Abbey Road Studios, and the track made the UK singles charts, peaking at #56. The next year they recorded &quot;Terry&quot;, written and originally recorded by Twinkle, but this single failed to chart. The group split up soon afterward.

Continuing her theatrical work, she played the title role in the first production of Daniel Mornin&#x27;s &quot;Kate&quot; at the Bush Theatre in 1983. That year she also appeared in episodes of popular TV series &quot;Bergerac&quot; and &quot;Reilly, Ace of Spies&quot;. Her work for the English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theatre continued with performances as Pam in Danny Boyle&#x27;s production of Saved and June in Max Stafford-Clark&#x27;s &quot;The Pope&#x27;s Wedding&quot; from 1984 to 1985.

===Rise to prominence===
Whalley found early success on British television with a lead role in Troy Kennedy Martin&#x27;s highly regarded and influential drama serial &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; (BBC, 1985), for which she received a nomination for the BAFTA TV Award for Best Actress. At this time she appeared in Alan Bleasdale&#x27;s comedy film &quot;No Surrender&quot; (1985) and two films for Mike Newell: &quot;The Good Father&quot; (FilmFour, 1985) and the critically acclaimed &quot;Dance with a Stranger&quot; (Goldcrest, 1985). She also concluded her work at the Royal Court Theatre this year by performing the role of Bianca in William Gaskill&#x27;s production of &quot;Women Beware Women&quot; and then moved to the Royal National Theatre appearing as Dewey Dell in Peter Gill&#x27;s productions of &quot;As I Lay Dying&quot; at the Cottesloe Theatre.

Further television success came with the key role of Nurse Mills in Dennis Potter&#x27;s drama serial &quot;The Singing Detective&quot; (BBC, 1986). She concluded her work with the Royal National Theatre that year by performing as Euphie and 1st Cutie in Peter Gill and John Burgess&#x27;s &quot;The Women&quot;. The following year she performed as Masha in Bill Kenwright and Elijah Moshinsky&#x27;s production of &quot;Three Sisters&quot; at the Albery Theatre and the Greenwich Theatre.

Whalley met the American actor Val Kilmer in 1987 while filming her first US lead role in George Lucas and Ron Howard&#x27;s Academy Award nominated fantasy adventure &quot;Willow&quot; (1988). After her wedding to Kilmer in 1988, she moved to Los Angeles to continue her film career and began using &#x27;Joanne Whalley-Kilmer&#x27; as her professional SAG-AFTRA name.

Her most notable British film role to date was as Christine Keeler in Michael Caton-Jones&#x27;s historical drama &quot;Scandal&quot; (1989), a fictionalised account of the Profumo affair, which screened in competition at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival, featuring John Hurt as Stephen Ward and Sir Ian McKellen as John Profumo. That same year she also co-starred with Kilmer in John Dahl&#x27;s neo-noir &quot;Kill Me Again&quot; (1989) and received a Theatre World Award for her performance of Geraldine Barklay in John Tillinger&#x27;s off-Broadway production of &quot;What the Butler Saw&quot; for the Manhattan Theatre Club.

Further theatrical work came with her performance in the title role of Lulu in Ian McDiarmid&#x27;s production of &quot;The Lulu Plays&quot; at the Almeida Theatre in 1990 to 1991. Later that year she gave birth to her first child, Mercedes, in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

She recreated Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s iconic heroine Scarlett O&#x27;Hara, originally played by Vivien Leigh in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939), in the Emmy Award-winning TV miniseries &quot;Scarlett&quot; (CBS, 1994). That same year she also played the lead role in Heywood Gould&#x27;s legal thriller &quot;Trial by Jury&quot; (1994). She gave birth to her second child, Jack, the following year.

After her divorce from Kilmer in 1996, she changed her surname back to Whalley, starting with her lead role in Jon Amiel&#x27;s spy comedy &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Little&quot; (1997) starring Bill Murray. She played the title role of former US First Lady Jackie Kennedy in David Burton Morris&#x27;s Emmy Award-winning miniseries &quot;Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis&quot; (CBS, 2000).

She guest-starred as Princess Sophie in season 4 of &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;. With the cast of &quot;44 Inch Chest&quot;, she shared the Best Ensemble Award at the San Diego Film Critics Society Awards 2010. The film reunited her with John Hurt, with whom she had done two previous films. In 2014 she played Aunt Patience in &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot; for BBC One. In 2015, she played Claudia, the wife of Pontius Pilate, in &quot;A.D. The Bible Continues&quot;, and Catherine of Aragon in the BBC miniseries &quot;Wolf Hall&quot;.

She has made a number of appearances in streaming shows including roles as Sister Maggie in the third season of &quot;Daredevil&quot; (2018), reprising her role of Sorsha from the &quot;Willow&quot; film (Lucas Film, 1988) in the &quot;Willow&quot; series (Disney+, 2022), and a starring appearance in an episode of the second season of &quot;Carnival Row&quot; (Prime, 2023) as the &quot;Puck&quot; Leonora.

In 2020, Whalley starred in Eleanor Coppola&#x27;s anthology film &quot;Love Is Love Is Love&quot;. It was scheduled to have its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2020, but the festival was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>In the Nordic countries, especially Denmark and Sweden, but not on Iceland, snaps ( , ), among many nicknames, is a small shot of a strong alcoholic beverage taken during the course of a meal.

In Denmark, a snaps will always be akvavit, although there are many varieties of it. In Sweden, &quot;snaps&quot; is a more general term; it is usually akvavit, although it may also be vodka, bitters/bitter liqueurs or some other kind of &quot;brännvin&quot;. Spirits such as whisky or brandy are seldom drunk as snaps. In Norway, a more common name is &quot;dram&quot; (from the unit of the same name). One of Finland&#x27;s strongest alcohol drinks served with snaps is Marskin ryyppy, named after Marshal C. G. E. Mannerheim.

The word &quot;snaps&quot; also has the same meaning as German &quot;Schnapps&quot; (), in the sense of &quot;any strong alcoholic drink&quot;.

== Culture ==
Swedes, Danes and Swedish-speaking Finns have a tradition of singing songs, called &quot;snapsvisor&quot; (&quot;snaps shanties&quot;), before drinking snaps. These drinking songs are typically odes to the joys of drinking snaps. They may praise the flavour of snaps or express a craving for it.

Snaps and &quot;snapsvisor&quot; are essential elements of Swedish crayfish parties, which are notoriously tipsy affairs. Dozens of songs may be sung during such a party, and every song requires a round of snaps. However, the glass need not be emptied every time.

Another subculture are the many nicknames for snaps, some of which might be regional. Some names are heavily associated with certain phrases used in conjunction with snaps drinking.

<doc id="681655" wikidata="Q3269403" url="?curid=681655" title="Buffel">
<text>The Buffel (English: &quot;Buffalo&quot;) is an infantry mobility vehicle used by the South African Defence Force during the South African Border War. The Buffel was also used as an armoured fighting vehicle and proved itself in this role. It replaced the older Bedford RL-based Hippo APC and itself was replaced by the Mamba from 1995 in South Africa, but remains in use elsewhere, notably Sri Lanka.

==Production history==
The Buffel was the first truly effective landmine-protected armored personnel carrier to enter service anywhere. The South African Army began deploying it in the operational area from 1978. The Buffel was an improvement over the Bosvark which offered little protection to the driver. In 1974, 54 Mercedes-Benz Unimog 416–162 chassis had been hastily converted into Bosvarks by 61 Base Workshops in Pretoria. The Bosvark offered limited landmine protection to the crew, but compensated for this with good off-road mobility. It is estimated that around 2,400 Buffels were delivered before production stopped. Sri Lanka purchased Buffels in the 1980s, and in the early 1990s the vehicle was exported to Uganda.

The Buffel (Afrikaans for &quot;Buffalo&quot;) was not a wholly South African built vehicle, but made use of the chassis, engine and some other components of the Mercedes-Benz U416-162 Unimog, which were fitted with a domestically designed armoured driver&#x27;s cab and separate armoured troop compartment. The cab was situated on the left with the engine compartment on the right. Later models replaced the original Mercedes-Benz OM352 engine with copies built under license by Atlantis Diesel Engines factory near Cape Town.

Land mine protection was provided by the V-shaped hull underneath these compartments, which quite effectively deflected the blast. The troop compartment contained two plastic tanks in the vee beneath the floor: a 200-litre fuel tank and a 100-litre water tank. The water tank provided drinking water to the occupants by means of a tap at the rear of the vehicle.

In order to help dissipate the energy from hitting a mine, the large tyres were sometimes filled with water, adding about 500 kg per wheel to the vehicle weight.

==Variants==
SAA variants

*Buffel - original
*Buffel Mk 1 - Improved engine and bush guard (bumper)
*Buffel Mk 1B - Disc brakes replaced drum brakes
*Log Buffel - Logistic/Cargo version, a standard Buffel with the seat assembly removed from the troop compartment
*Buffel Mk IIA - Essentially a rebuild of earlier Mk 1s with an enclosed troop compartment, a rear exit door and large bulletproof windows on the sides and rear. Referred to as Moffel.
*Buffel Mk IIB - Cargo carrier. The SA Army ordered 57 of these in the early 1980s. Payload capacity stated as 2.637 tons.

SAAF variants

*Bulldog - based on SAMIL 20 truck with the driver&#x27;s cab on the right. The Bulldog was utilized by the SAAF for patrolling airfields. A variant called the &quot;Ystervark&quot; was produced and used in the anti-aircraft role.
*Rhino - A further development of the Bulldog but with the driver seated inside a fully enclosed troop compartment. 20 were produced for the SAAF.

Sri Lankan variants
*Unicorn - Sri Lanka Army produced version of the Buffel original.

*Unibuffel - Sri Lanka Army produced version of the Mk I and Mk II with Tata and Leyland engine and an enclosed troop compartment.

<text>Highway 31 is a minor north–south highway through the Selkirk Mountains in British Columbia, Canada. The highway first gained its number in 1973, and it is one of the few numbered highways in the province that is not fully paved. Highway 31 has a total distance of — along Kootenay Lake between Balfour (a junction with Highway 3A) and Kaslo (a junction with Highway 31A), north along Kootenay Lake north of Kaslo, then the Duncan and Lardeau Rivers and the north shore of Trout Lake, and between the northwest end of Trout Lake and Galena Bay, where it ends at Highway 23.

The highway is a gravel road between Meadow Creek at the north end of Kootenay Lake and Trout Lake. Care should be taken when driving the route as it is narrow and has drop offs into Trout Lake north of Gerrard.

The section between Lardeau and Gerrard was possibly a part of a railway. The railway was converted into a highway in 1942 or early 1943 as part of a rail-to-road conversion project. The work took only two months to complete.

==Major intersections==


==Highway 31A==
Highway 31&#x27;s main spur, Highway 31A, which also opened in 1973, is long, connecting Highway 31 at Kaslo to Highway 6 at New Denver.

<doc id="681666" wikidata="Q864015" url="?curid=681666" title="Penrose diagram">
<text>In theoretical physics, a Penrose diagram (named after mathematical physicist Roger Penrose) is a two-dimensional diagram capturing the causal relations between different points in spacetime through a conformal treatment of infinity. It is an extension (suitable for the curved spacetimes of e.g. general relativity) of the Minkowski diagram of special relativity where the vertical dimension represents time, and the horizontal dimension represents a space dimension. Using this design, all light rays take a 45° path formula_1. Locally, the metric on a Penrose diagram is conformally equivalent to the metric of the spacetime depicted. The conformal factor is chosen such that the entire infinite spacetime is transformed into a Penrose diagram of finite size, with infinity on the boundary of the diagram. For spherically symmetric spacetimes, every point in the Penrose diagram corresponds to a 2-dimensional sphere formula_2.

== Basic properties ==
While Penrose diagrams share the same basic coordinate vector system of other spacetime diagrams for local asymptotically flat spacetime, it introduces a system of representing distant spacetime by shrinking or &quot;triturando&quot; distances that are further away. Straight lines of constant time and straight lines of constant space coordinates therefore become hyperbolae, which appear to converge at points in the corners of the diagram. These points and boundaries represent conformal infinity for spacetime, which was first introduced by Penrose in 1963.

Penrose diagrams are more properly (but less frequently) called Penrose–Carter diagrams (or Carter–Penrose diagrams), acknowledging both Brandon Carter and Roger Penrose, who were the first researchers to employ them. They are also called conformal diagrams, or simply spacetime diagrams (although the latter may refer to Minkowski diagrams).

Two lines drawn at 45° angles should intersect in the diagram only if the corresponding two light rays intersect in the actual spacetime. So, a Penrose diagram can be used as a concise illustration of spacetime regions that are accessible to observation. The diagonal boundary lines of a Penrose diagram correspond to the region called &quot;null infinity&quot;, or to singularities where light rays must end. Thus, Penrose diagrams are also useful in the study of asymptotic properties of spacetimes and singularities. An infinite static Minkowski universe, coordinates formula_3 is related to Penrose coordinates formula_4 by:
: formula_5
The corners of the Penrose diagram, which represent the spacelike and timelike conformal infinities, are formula_6 from the origin.

== Black holes ==
Penrose diagrams are frequently used to illustrate the causal structure of spacetimes containing black holes. Singularities in the Schwarzschild solution are denoted by a spacelike boundary, unlike the timelike boundary found on conventional spacetime diagrams. This is due to the interchanging of timelike and spacelike coordinates within the horizon of a black hole (since space is uni-directional within the horizon, just as time is uni-directional outside the horizon).
The singularity is represented by a spacelike boundary to make it clear that once an object has passed the horizon it will inevitably hit the singularity even if it attempts to take evasive action.

Penrose diagrams are often used to illustrate the hypothetical Einstein–Rosen bridge connecting two separate universes in the maximally extended Schwarzschild black hole solution. The precursors to the Penrose diagrams were Kruskal–Szekeres diagrams. (The Penrose diagram adds to Kruskal and Szekeres&#x27; diagram the conformal crunching of the regions of flat spacetime far from the hole.) These introduced the method of aligning the event horizon into past and future horizons oriented at 45° angles (since one would need to travel faster than light to cross from the Schwarzschild radius back into flat spacetime); and splitting the singularity into past and future horizontally-oriented lines (since the singularity &quot;cuts off&quot; all paths into the future once one enters the hole).

The Einstein–Rosen bridge closes off (forming &quot;future&quot; singularities) so rapidly that passage between the two asymptotically flat exterior regions would require faster-than-light velocity, and is therefore impossible. In addition, highly blue-shifted light rays (called a blue sheet) would make it impossible for anyone to pass through.
The maximally extended solution does not describe a typical black hole created from the collapse of a star, as the surface of the collapsed star replaces the sector of the solution containing the past-oriented &quot;white hole&quot; geometry and other universe.

While the basic space-like passage of a static black hole cannot be traversed, the Penrose diagrams for solutions representing rotating and/or electrically charged black holes illustrate these solutions&#x27; inner event horizons (lying in the future) and vertically oriented singularities, which open up what is known as a time-like &quot;wormhole&quot; allowing passage into future universes. In the case of the rotating hole, there is also a &quot;negative&quot; universe entered through a ring-shaped singularity (still portrayed as a line in the diagram) that can be passed through if entering the hole close to its axis of rotation. These features of the solutions are, however, not stable under perturbations and not believed to be a realistic description of the interior regions of such black holes; the true character of their interiors is still an open question.

<text>Talladega Superspeedway (formerly named Alabama International Motor Speedway from 1969 to 1989) is a tri-oval superspeedway in Lincoln, Alabama. The track has hosted a variety of racing events since its inaugural season of racing in 1969, primarily races sanctioned by NASCAR. The track is currently owned by NASCAR and is led by track president Brian Crichton. The facility has a grandstand capacity of 80,000 as of 2022. Along with the main track, the track complex also features a long roval-style road course.

After a proposal in Spartanburg, South Carolina, fell through in the early 1960s, NASCAR founder Bill France Sr. opted to seek his proposal elsewhere, eventually landing on an area near Talladega, Alabama. Over the track&#x27;s first couple decades, it gained a reputation for being a fast, wild, and chaotic track, with speeds of over , major accidents, and unusual occurrences being commonplace. NASCAR&#x27;s introduction of the restrictor plate and the subsequent appearance of pack racing in the late 1980s exacerbated its chaotic reputation, with &quot;Big One&quot; accidents involving 10 or more cars occurring often; a phenomenon that has lasted into the present day.

== Description ==

=== Configuration ===
Talladega Superspeedway in its current form is measured at , with 33 degrees of banking in the turns, 16.5 degrees of banking in the tri-oval section, and two degrees of banking in the straights. The track, similar in shape to the NASCAR-owned Daytona International Speedway, differs from Daytona due to its start-finish line; Talladega&#x27;s start finish line is around a away from the track&#x27;s center point. Within NASCAR&#x27;s schedule, Talladega Superspeedway is the longest oval NASCAR races on during the season. Talladega Superspeedway also features a roval-style road course, measuring at .

=== Amenities ===
Talladega Superspeedway is located near Interstate 20. As of 2022, Talladega Superspeedway has a capacity of 80,000 according to the &quot;Sports Business Journal&quot;. At its peak, the track contained a capacity of 143,000 according to a 2003 spectator&#x27;s guide given by the &quot;Montgomery Advertiser&quot;. The track&#x27;s infield covers approximately 270 acres according to &quot;Business Insider&quot;, and hosts around 2,700 RV parking spots. In total, the track complex covers around 3,000 acres, with the facility being the largest on the NASCAR schedule.

==== Race weekend party scene ====
Talladega Superspeedway is known for its infield party scene during race weekends, gaining a reputation for a chaotic, Woodstock/Mardi Gras-type atmosphere. The party scene has been described by &quot;ESPN&quot;&#x27;s Ryan McGee as &quot;full of redneck engineering and school buses and questionable decisions&quot;. Games, parades, and nudity has been reported by numerous journalists as being commonplace; with reporter Mike Hembree stating that the focus of the party scene was &quot;toward beer, liquor, racing, boobs and, somewhat down the list, college football.&quot; Elizabeth Blackstock, writer for &quot;Jalopnik&quot;, stated that at Talladega, &quot;People turn into &quot;animals&quot;. If you’ve ever wanted to know what it looks like when humans just cease giving a fuck, I highly recommend finding your nearest infield campground.&quot; Considered to be &quot;notoriously rowdy&quot; in the 1980s, by the 2000s, Talladega Superspeedway officials started to crack down on &quot;hard-core lawlessness&quot;, adding in a makeshift jail and making the scene &quot;more civilized&quot;.

== Track history ==

=== Planning and construction ===

==== Failed Spartanburg proposal ====

Sometime in the early 1960s, NASCAR founder Bill France Sr. made initial plans to construct a superspeedway in Spartanburg, South Carolina, with the help of Spartanburg native Joe Littlejohn. In October 1963, designs for the Spartanburg track were drawn up by C. H. Moneypenny, with it planned to be built near the Spartanburg Downtown Memorial Airport. An official announcement was made on February 18, 1964, with stated hopes of building 50,000 seats and a budget of &quot;near a million dollars&quot;; it was also touted as a &quot;little Daytona&quot;. However, while France Sr. later stated that plans were &quot;far away from building&quot; in March, local residents near the airport immediately raised opposition towards the proposal in the Spartanburg City Council; particularly due to concerns of increased noise. Despite further rumored plans to build a new airport terminal for the airport, further opposition was raised due to local blue laws. Despite this, in May, France Sr. continued to scout for potential sites. The proposal was eventually rejected by the local city council; the rejection, which heavily contributed to the declining racing scene of Spartanburg that started in the start of the 1960s, was seen by locals as the point of no return of the city&#x27;s decline. In an interview, longtime NASCAR driver James Hylton stated that the city council &quot;stuck a knife in their hearts, their own hearts. Because if the city fathers in Spartanburg and Spartanburg County had approved that, this would be Talladega... All the people who had a vote on that really didn&#x27;t understand racing. They really didn&#x27;t have a clue as to what the future held.&quot;

==== Anniston Air Force Base proposal ====
According to multiple people associated with Talladega Superspeedway&#x27;s beginnings, sometime in 1965, former driver and businessman Fonty Flock convinced France Sr. to scout the Anniston, Alabama, area. At the beginning of 1966, &quot;The Anniston Star&quot; reported that France Sr. was negotiating to build a $1.5 million (adjusted for inflation, $) facility in Eastaboga near the Talladega Municipal Airport. However, according to France Sr., local Alabama tax laws and the cost of surrounding land were deterrents to the track&#x27;s construction. In February, France Sr. had reportedly began negotiations in Gadsden. However, in the next several months, France Sr. and city of Talladega officials resumed negotiations for the Eastaboga proposal. In August, the Alabama Senate passed a measure to allow Talladega and its nearby cities to finance the track with their own credit. The measure was signed by governor George Wallace soon after; by this point, Talladega Industrial Development Board chairman O. V. Hill stated that the budget for the project had risen to $6 million (adjusted for inflation, $), and planned to host a capacity from 40 to 50 thousand seats. Leaders of the now-proposed track also hoped to raise $3 million and acquire approximately 1,500 acres of land to kickstart the project. Nearing the end of the year, leaders awaited a verdict from the Union Oil Company on whether they would invest $3.5 million for the project.

France Sr. later stated hopes of starting construction in the summer of 1967 and to open the track sometime in 1969. A finalized plan of the project was reported in April 1967, which according to France Sr. was &quot;economically justified&quot;. In June, France Sr. stated in &quot;The Anniston Star&quot; that the &quot;bond market just isn&#x27;t what it should be at the present&quot;; however, speculated rumors of Pure Oil, a subsidiary of Union Oil, investing the entire amount needed to finance the project were also being made, with a feasibility report stating that the project was &quot;highly favorable&quot;. In the next month, a party associated with France and Pure Oil were reported to have invested two-thirds of the financing needed for its construction, along with the city of Talladega offering 650 acres. At the beginning of 1968, France Sr. announced that the track would be longer than the France Sr.-owned Daytona International Speedway by &quot;400 [to] 600 feet&quot;. In the same announcement, he also stated that he aimed to start construction in a couple of months and that the project was &quot;90 percent assured&quot;. On March 14, Talladega County officials announced that they hoped for a final verdict on access road financing in order to finally approve the project; however, a sale of $2 million to First Alabama Securities relating to industrial bonds failed to go through. Despite this, France Sr. and Hill did not consider the lack of funds to be a major problem, and instead were so confident that they thought that the purchase would nevertheless be secured within the next month. In April, the city of Talladega gave France Sr. 2,000 acres at the site of the former Anniston Air Force Base.

On May 16, 1968, France Sr. officially announced the construction of the project along with a new airport runway near the track, which came at a final projected cost of $5 million and an opening date in September 1969. Groundbreaking occurred seven days later, with the facility officially being named the Alabama International Motor Speedway (AIMS). At the groundbreaking ceremony, France Sr. stated plans to host NASCAR, sports car, and motorcycle events at the facility. France Sr.&#x27;s son, Bill France Jr., was placed in charge of AIMS. During construction, the track was advertised to have bankings steeper than Daytona International Speedway and potential average speeds over . In October, work began on constructing grandstands, which involved bulldozing part of the Talladega Mountains. In April 1969, a &quot;roval&quot; road course was announced by France Sr. That same month, reports by the &quot;Associated Press&quot; stated that AIMS was selling 70 tickets daily on average. In July, the amount of tickets sold daily was &quot;100 or more&quot;, with the goal of 100,000 people coming to the inaugural race being &quot;assured&quot;. The next month, the only construction fatality occurred when W. L. Harry died when a crane hit his head, crushing his skull.

=== Chaotic first years ===

==== 1969 Talladega 500 ====
A date to christen AIMS was scheduled for September 14, 1969, for the 1969 Talladega 500. The first tire tests for the facility were ran by LeeRoy Yarbrough and Donnie Allison in early August, with both claiming unofficial world closed circuit speed records. Both drivers complained of &quot;rough places&quot; on the surface of the track during testing. Later in the month, Bobby Allison in a newly-unveiled Dodge Charger Daytona ran another test session; Bobby later claimed that the track had &quot;great big holes&quot; in its surface. France Sr. admitted the appearance of three holes due to Hurricane Camille, but also claimed that the holes were filled before Bobby made testing runs. On race weekend, although the track surface was completed, numerous amenities, including VIP suites, were either unfinished or &quot;barebones&quot; according to longtime motorsports journalist Dave Despain.
The track officially opened to the public on September 9 for practice sessions for the Talladega 500. The track surface drew complaints from drivers, particularly drivers from the newly-formed Professional Drivers Association (PDA), a drivers&#x27; union. PDA drivers Cale Yarborough, Buddy Baker, and Charlie Glotzbach all reported that the surface was &quot;rough&quot; and caused increased tire wear amongst both Goodyear and Firestone tires; the two tire suppliers for the race. Baker later added, &quot;they haven’t built a tire out of anything that will stand up if you hit a chuckhole at 200 miles per hour&quot;. Tires were also reported to have only lasted 4 laps until they became &quot;shredded&quot;, with Firestone pulling out of the event. &quot;Anniston Star&quot; writer George Smith remarked that due to the never-before-seen speeds in NASCAR, &quot;no one really knew what to expect of speeds in the 195-200 m.p.h. range.&quot; As a result of the complaints, drivers asked France Sr. if the race to be postponed; he refused, mainly due to the high cost of building the track, which France Sr. feared would bankrupt the track if the race was postponed. He proceeded to tell the drivers to race at slower speeds; this was refused by the drivers. After an incident that involved Yarbrough punching France Sr. after France Sr. called Yarbrough too scared to race, a meeting involving 36 PDA drivers almost unanimously agreed to withdraw from the event.

Despite almost every major driver withdrawing from the race, with the exceptions of Tiny Lund and Bobby Isaac, France Sr. announced his intents to still run the race, stating in &quot;The Anniston Star&quot;, &quot;I can&#x27;t guarantee you how many cars will run right now, but there will be a race Sunday afternoon.&quot; After the first race ever ran at the track, a preliminary NASCAR Grand American Series race won by Ken Rush, France Sr. decided to seek out non-PDA, Grand American, and PDA scab drivers to race in the main event; he also let in the smaller Grand American &quot;pony cars&quot;, which had less power, run in the event. Chrysler, who was set to debut the winged Dodge Charger Daytona at the event, replaced Bobby Allison with PDA scab Richard Brickhouse. To appease fans, France Sr. also announced that any fan with a Talladega 500 ticket stub could attend any Daytona or Talladega race for free in 1970. The race ran without any major issues, with Brickhouse winning the event in front of a crowd of 64,000, which was lower than expected. However, second-place finisher Jim Vandiver, who was driving an older Dodge model, accused NASCAR of rigging the race; the protests were unsuccessful.

==== Don Naman era, slow expansion ====
The track&#x27;s second season oversaw decreasing attendance and increased disdain over the quality of racing at the track. The 1970 Alabama 500 saw a decrease of over 10,000 people from the 1969 Talladega 500, with NASCAR officials stating the attendance was &quot;disappointing&quot;. In June, reporters stated that AIMS had covered up several parts of grandstands with tarp due to a lack of spectators during races. A series of races held at AIMS in July were described by &quot;Anniston Star&quot; writer Tommy Hornsby as &quot;a complete flop&quot;. In October 1970, AIMS appointed Don Naman, promoter of the Tennessee-based Smoky Mountain Speedway, as the track&#x27;s first general manager. Within the first month, Naman announced an improvement project that aimed to remove track surface bumps along with renovating press boxes and the track&#x27;s control tower. As part of the project, the track surface was resurfaced by using a mixture that acted as a sealant. The first race under Naman&#x27;s tenure saw increased attendance, with 63,500 attending despite heavy doubt placed onto the track, leading to hopes of later races having more attending per race. Within 1972, attendance had rose with Naman stated hopes of building new grandstands; the track also had a better reputation in local Alabama media. The next year, attendance had rose to such a point to where one &quot;Anniston Star&quot; reporter had described AIMS&#x27; future as &quot;all sunshine&quot;.

Expansions and renovations remained at a slow pace throughout Naman&#x27;s tenure. In 1975, AIMS officials announced renovations worth over $200,000; among said renovations was the addition of a new press box on the track&#x27;s frontstretch that costed around $150,000, additional loudspeakers, and additional spectator gates. Further renovations to paddock areas were announced in 1977, along with the addition of a new 2,200-seat grandstand. A second repave was also announced in 1979 due to heavy rain. That same year, Naman stated that officials hoped to expand to accommodate at least 150,000 fans by 1990. The next year, a new, $80,000 scoring stand was added that accommodated around 100 people. In 1985, $200,000 worth of renovations were made to the track&#x27;s garage area and parts of the grandstands. A new, 2,500-seat tower, the Anniston Tower, was constructed in 1986 and completed the following year, increasing the grandstand capacity of AIMS to 72,000. In November 1986, talks of annexing AIMS into the city of Talladega was proposed by Talladega mayor Larry Barton in order to pay off a $1 million deficit; however, annexation talks died down by early next year.

==== Rising speeds, breaking records ====

Within the track&#x27;s early years, the track became known for its fast speeds, with multiple world records being broken; some records were more than once were broken at the track. In March 1970, Buddy Baker became the first person to break on a closed course, setting an average speed of . Seven months later, Bobby Isaac broke Baker&#x27;s record, setting a lap of . In 1971, Paula Murphy broke the women&#x27;s world record for the closed-circuit speed record, setting a lap of . In August 1974, A. J. Foyt took the overall closed-circuit speed record from Mario Andretti, setting a speed of an average speed of . Foyt&#x27;s record was broken a year later by Mark Donohue, with Donohue setting an average speed of .

In the 1980s, the women&#x27;s world record for the closed-circuit speed record was broken numerous times. Over the course of two days, Lyn St. James broke the women&#x27;s record and became the first women to break over 200 mph, setting a lap of on the second day of testing. The women&#x27;s world record was broken three times within the next five years; St. James broke her own record in October 1988, and Patty Moise broke the record soon after St. James&#x27; attempt the following year in December. Moise proceeded to break her own record a month later, setting a lap of .

==== Injury and chaos-riddled period, alleged Talladega Curse ====
In the track&#x27;s early years, numerous incidents that were either deemed unusual or caused either major injury or death occurred at AIMS both on and off the track, leading to beliefs of a &quot;Talladega Curse&quot; which stemmed from the belief that the track was built on cursed indigenous American land as a result of the Trail of Tears; an idea that has been dismissed by former Talladega Superspeedway general manager Grant Lynch as a marketing ploy created by Jim Hunter, a past publicity director for the track. In the 1973 Winston 500, a crash involving 19 cars hospitalized four drivers; Wendell Scott, one of the hospitalized four, was left so badly injured that the accident effectively ended his racing career. That same year at the Talladega 500, driver Larry Smith became the first fatality at the track when Smith blew a tire and hit the wall, suffering major head injuries. In the same race, longtime driver Bobby Isaac retired abruptly from both the race and full-time racing after he stated that he heard voices in his head telling him to quit during the race. At the 1974 Winston 500, ten of the top 11 qualified cars reported that their cars had been &quot;sabotaged&quot;, with various mechanical failures being found and deliberately caused; the culprit was never found. Two more fatalities, pit crew member Randy Owens and driver Tiny Lund, both occurred in 1975 in separate races.

Unusual incidents continued into the 1980s. At the 1982 Winston 500, L. W. Wright, a confidence trickster, was able to launder thousands of dollars worth of equipment from multiple organizations, including Sterling Marlin, Goodyear, and NASCAR themselves. After attempting to race and subsequently being parked during the race for being too slow, he vanished without a trace despite a manhunt, and was only found in 2022 when he agreed to reveal himself for a podcast. At the 1986 Winston 500, spectator Darren Crowder broke into the race&#x27;s safety car and took it for a joyride in what is considered by longtime NASCAR journalist Steve Waid as &quot;Talladega’s most bizarre incident&quot;. At the 1987 Winston 500, Bobby Allison blew a tire in the track&#x27;s frontstretch at high speeds, causing his car to go airborne and crash into a protective catchfence, injuring four spectators. Considered to be one of the most influential moments in NASCAR&#x27;s history, as a result of Allison&#x27;s crash, NASCAR introduced the restrictor plate to reduce speeds; a requirement that lasted until 2019.

=== Mike Helton and Grant Lynch eras ===

In October 1987, Naman announced his intents to retire to become a member of the board of directors at the International Motorsports Hall of Fame, with former Atlanta International Speedway general director Mike Helton taking his position. In the aftermath of Bobby Allison&#x27;s 1987 crash at AIMS, a renovated and heavier catchfence replaced the original catchfence in 1988. On January 30, 1989, Helton became the president of the track; on the same day, the track was renamed to Talladega Superspeedway, with publicity director Jim Freeman stating in a press release that &quot;it&#x27;s shorter, and everybody called it &#x27;Talladega&#x27; anyway&quot;. Under Helton&#x27;s leadership, numerous renovations to Talladega Superspeedway were made. In 1990, upgrades to all of the frontstretch grandstands were made so they could withstand a double-tiered system; 2,000 seats were also added to the Birmingham Tower, along with a new media center. A new infield campground was added in May 1992; it was met with relative praise. Further additions to the Birmingham Tower were announced later that year, with around 3,000 seats being constructed. At the end of 1993, Helton left to become the vice president of competition for NASCAR, with general manager Grant Lynch taking Helton&#x27;s position.

Under Lynch&#x27;s tenure, Talladega Superspeedway underwent through constant expansion due to fears that the track was falling behind in quality of amenities of rivaling tracks; particularly tracks built by Bruton Smith&#x27;s company, Speedway Motorsports. Seats were added in both 1994 and 1995, with 3,100 and 5,000 seats being added in each year, respectively. A new grandstand, the 7,800-seat Gadsden Tower, was added in 1997; by this point, temporary stands were also added to accommodate more fans for its NASCAR races. Another 11,000-seat tower was announced the following year, increasing the total capacity of the track&#x27;s grandstands to 120,000; the project was the track&#x27;s ninth expansion in the last decade. Within the same year, the track also received a makeover; landscaping was done to make the track visible from Interstate 20 and the seats were colored red and blue to replace the &quot;historically grey and dull&quot; aesthetic of the track. A second phase of expansion following the 1998 renovation was also announced that same year, with hopes of the track eventually hosting &quot;well above 200,000&quot; within its grandstands. A 22,000-seat backstretch grandstand, the Allison Grandstand, was announced in April 1999 and completed in October of that year. Another expansion to the O. V. Hill Grandstands was made in 2001, with 5,200 seats being added. By 2003, according to the &quot;Montgomery Advertiser&quot;, the track hosted a grandstand seating capacity of 143,000.

In December 2005, track officials announced a complete repave of Talladega; the first since 1979. Construction on the repave started on May 2, 2006, a day later than expected due to rain. The repave was met with positive reactions from drivers, including Tony Stewart and Dennis Setzer. It was eventually completed by September 25 of that year, in time for ARCA Re/Max Series testing. The next year, Lynch was replaced by general manager Rick Humphrey, with Lynch being transferred to work at the corporate ISC offices. A $13 million, two-phase renovation project was announced in 2009, which aimed to renovate outdated seating and improve accessibility. Lynch came back to his old position the following year when Humphrey was transferred to ISC. The early 2010s saw steep attendance declines due to the effects of the Great Recession; a peak of approximately 190,000 in the 2003 Aaron&#x27;s 499 had fallen to 108,500 by the 2012 iteration of the same event. In 2013, track officials announced that grandstand capacity would be decreased to 80,000, demolishing the backstretch Allison Grandstands. In lieu of the Allison Grandstands, officials decided to honor the Alabama Gang by renaming the backstretch.

==== Continued reputation of wild, crash-riddled track ====

The track&#x27;s reputation as a chaotic facility continued into the 1990s and the new millennium. As part of the introduction of the restrictor plate mandated in the wake of Bobby Allison&#x27;s crash in the 1987 Winston 500, cars were made drastically slower; an unintended consequence due to slower speeds was the introduction of pack racing. As part of restrictor plate racing, major accidents involving numerous cars, often called the &quot;Big One&quot;, occurred often. At the 1993 DieHard 500, two separate major accidents occurred. Early in the race, multiple drivers were involved in a seven-car crash; one of them, Stanley Smith, suffered a basilar skull fracture that affected Smith for the rest of his life. In the same accident, Jimmy Horton&#x27;s car went over the protective wall; the first of its kind since 1969 in the NASCAR Cup Series. Later in the race, Neil Bonnett&#x27;s car went airborne and hit the catchfence on the track&#x27;s frontstretch, tearing a 20-foot gap. The next year at the 1994 Winston Select 500, a multi-car accident involving Mark Martin sent Martin through the infield of the track, with Martin breaking through an infield guardrail. At the 1996 Winston Select 500, Ricky Craven was involved in a 14-car accident that sent Craven&#x27;s car airborne at nearly the same spot during Horton&#x27;s crash in 1993; however, due to a newly-added catchfence that was added in the turn in the wake of Horton&#x27;s crash, Craven&#x27;s car was able to stay within the track confines.

Heading into the new millennium, major accidents continued, with incidents involving at least 20 cars occurring frequently. At the 2002 Aaron&#x27;s 312, a 27-car pileup occurred, breaking an all-time record for the most cars involved in an incident in any of NASCAR&#x27;s top three series in the modern era. At the Aaron&#x27;s 499 that same year, an incident late in the race involved two dozen cars. The record was tied at the 2003 Aaron&#x27;s 499, where the accident set a new all-time NASCAR Cup Series record for most cars involved in a single incident. Another catchfence incident occurred at the 2009 Aaron&#x27;s 499, when Carl Edwards&#x27; car went airborne on the final lap, crashing into the catchfence and injuring seven spectators. Three years later at the 2012 Good Sam Roadside Assistance 500, a 25-car accident occurred on the final lap of the race.

=== Brian Crichton era ===
In 2018, ISC announced a $50 million renovation to the track&#x27;s infield which aimed to completely revamp the garage and media center along with the additions of several amenities, including additional suites and a new infield tunnel. Work on the project started in October of that year, and was completed in September 2019. Also in 2018, Lynch announced his retirement from the track, ending a 25-year reign. It took effect after the 2019 1000Bulbs.com 500, with vice president of marketing and sales Brian Crichton replacing Lynch. The next year, the track came under controversy when a member of Bubba Wallace&#x27;s crew reported a potential noose in the midst of the George Floyd protests and the Black Lives Matter movement. A Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigation later determined that Wallace had not been a victim of a hate crime; the noose was a garage door pull rope that had existed since October 2019, although it was the only one shaped like a noose across NASCAR-owned tracks. To further modernize the track, a scoring pylon was removed in 2024 to get spectators to look at modern video screens for live scoring.

=== Racing ===

==== NASCAR ====
Since the track&#x27;s inaugural season of racing in 1969, the facility has held two annual NASCAR weekends for most of its history: the spring Jack Link&#x27;s 500 and the fall YellaWood 500. The former was first ran in 1970, and the latter was first run in 1969 to christen Talladega Superspeedway. Along with its Cup Series races, the facility also hosts lower-tier NASCAR Xfinity Series and NASCAR Truck Series races as support events for Cup Series races, including the Ag-Pro 300, United Rentals 250, and Love&#x27;s RV Stop 225.

==== IMSA GT Championship ====
In the 1970s, the IMSA GT Championship raced at the track&#x27;s road course numerous times. The series first raced at Talladega Superspeedway in 1971, and proceeded to race at the track five more times within the decade, including a six-hour endurance event in 1978. Although IMSA was scheduled to race at the circuit in 1979 in another six-hour event at the track, they opted to withdraw from the event.

==== Other racing events ====
The International Race of Champions (IROC) made occasional appearances at Talladega Superspeedway throughout its existence. The series first appeared in 1984 for a one-off appearance, opting to come back two years later before leaving again. IROC came back on a year-by-year basis starting in 1990, staying for a seven-year stint until leaving at the end of their 1996 season. IROC made its last year-by-year stint starting in 1999, racing there until 2003 (with the exception of 2002).

The AMA Superbike Championship raced at the circuit in the early 1980s, first making their appearance in 1980. The series made their last appearance at the circuit in 1983.

=== Other events ===
In 1974, initial plans were made for the track to host a music festival that was organized by the organizers of Woodstock; the organizers had chosen the track party because &quot;people could take drugs in there and not be bothered by law enforcement.&quot; Then-general manager Don Naman, who was a devout Catholic, refused because he thought the festival &quot;wasn’t nice for the community&quot;. In 2024, the track hosted the Foodie’s Food Culture Festival, a food truck event.

==Lap records==

As of April 2024, the fastest official lap records at Talladega Superspeedway (formerly Alabama International Motor Speedway) are listed as:

== In popular culture ==

In June 2005, a collaborative movie project between NASCAR and Sony Pictures was announced, with Will Ferrell slated as the lead actor. Initially put into doubt, the working title was eventually announced as &quot;Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby&quot; in February 2006. Although most of movie&#x27;s production took place in the state of North Carolina, some scenes for the movie&#x27;s ending were shot at Talladega during the 2005 UAW-Ford 500. &quot;Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby&quot; was released on August 4, 2006, and is considered to be one of the most beloved racing-related movies of all time.

Parts of the 1983 movie &quot;Stroker Ace&quot; were filmed at the track. Also in 2005, filming for an episode for the eighth season of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; was produced at Talladega Superspeedway. In 2010, &quot;The Legend of Hallowdega&quot;, a mockumentary film produced by RadicalMedia as part of an Amp Energy advertising campaign that poked fun at the alleged Talladega Curse was released on Halloween of that year. Four years later, the track was heavily referenced in the Eric Church song &quot;Talladega&quot;, which detailed Church&#x27;s experiences with high school friends attending auto racing events at the track after Church graduated from high school.

<text>Baldrs draumar (Old Norse: &#x27;Baldr&#x27;s dreams&#x27;) or Vegtamskviða is an Eddic poem which appears in the manuscript AM 748 I 4to. It describes the myth of Baldr&#x27;s death consistently with &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;. Bellows suggest that the poem was composed in the mid 10th century as well as the possibility that the author also composed &quot;Völuspá&quot; or at least drew from it, pointing at the similarity of stanza 11 in &quot;Baldrs draumar&quot; and stanzas 32-33 in &quot;Völuspá&quot;. Additionally, the 14th stanza of &quot;Þrymskviða&quot; is almost identical to Baldrs draumar&#x27;s 1st stanza. Only in the last sentence do the two diverge from one another. Guðni argued that Þrymskviða was the younger poem of the two and it had received the stanza from Baldrs draumar. 

==Synopsis and text==
Baldr has been having nightmares. Odin rides to Hel to investigate. He finds the grave of a &quot;völva&quot; and resurrects her. Their conversation follows, where the völva tells Odin about Baldr&#x27;s fate. In the end Odin asks her a question which reveals his identity and the völva tells him to ride home.

==Form and date==
The poem is one of the shortest Eddic poems, consisting of 14 &quot;fornyrðislag&quot; stanzas. Some late paper manuscripts contain about five more stanzas, those are thought to be of young origin. Sophus Bugge believed them to have been composed by the author of &quot;Forspjallsljóð&quot;, which is thought to have been written in the 17th century. Bellows, on the other hand, suggests the poem is much older but could not date it earlier than the tenth century.

==Influence==
The confrontation between The Wanderer (Wotan) and Erda in Act 3, Scene 1 of Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera Siegfried is based upon &quot;Baldrs draumar&quot;.

The poem inspired a ballet, &quot;Baldurs draumar&quot; (&quot;Baldur&#x27;s Dreams&quot;), by the Norwegian composer Geirr Tveitt, first staged in 1938.

<doc id="681677" wikidata="Q1774974" url="?curid=681677" title="1994 Norwegian European Union membership referendum">
<text>A referendum on joining the European Union was held in Norway on 27 and 28 November 1994. After a long period of heated debate, the &quot;no&quot; side won with 52.2 per cent of the vote, on a turnout of 88.6 per cent. Membership of what was then the European Community had previously been rejected in a 1972 referendum, and by French veto in 1962.

==Campaign==
The &quot;No&quot; campaign was led by Anne Enger Lahnstein, leader of the Centre Party. The main themes of the &quot;No&quot; campaign were loss of sovereignty if Norway should join the Union, as well as the fundamental differences in economic structure between Norway and the EU, as Norway has an economy based heavily on natural resources (especially oil and fish), in contrast to the EU&#x27;s more industrial economy.

Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland led the &quot;Yes&quot; campaign. Her party, the Labour Party, was divided on the question of Norwegian membership of the Union. Unlike Trygve Bratteli in 1972, she refused to threaten to resign if the referendum failed to result in a &quot;Yes&quot; vote, on the grounds that more serious divisions could have arisen in the Labour Party. The main arguments of the &quot;Yes&quot; side were that as a European country, Norway belonged in the European Union, and that Norway&#x27;s economy would benefit from membership.

According to John Erik Fossum, a political science professor at ARENA, Centre for European Studies, University of Oslo, &quot;the fact that Norway had already signed the EEA agreement made it easier for people to vote no because they knew that Norway had assured EU market access.&quot;

<text>Edward Hallett Carr (28 June 1892 – 3 November 1982) was a British historian, diplomat, journalist and international relations theorist, and an opponent of empiricism within historiography. Carr was best known for &quot;A History of Soviet Russia&quot;, a 14-volume history of the Soviet Union from 1917 to 1929, for his writings on international relations, particularly &quot;The Twenty Years&#x27; Crisis&quot;, and for his book &quot;What Is History?&quot; in which he laid out historiographical principles rejecting traditional historical methods and practices.

Educated at the Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, London, and then at Trinity College, Cambridge, Carr began his career as a diplomat in 1916; three years later, he participated at the Paris Peace Conference as a member of the British delegation. Becoming increasingly preoccupied with the study of international relations and of the Soviet Union, he resigned from the Foreign Office in 1936 to begin an academic career. From 1941 to 1946, Carr worked as an assistant editor at &quot;The Times&quot;, where he was noted for his leaders (editorials) urging a socialist system and an Anglo-Soviet alliance as the basis of a post-war order.

Carr was born in London to a middle-class family, and was educated at the Merchant Taylors&#x27; School in London and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was awarded a first class degree in classics in 1916. Carr&#x27;s family had originated in northern England, and the first mention of his ancestors was a George Carr who served as the Sheriff of Newcastle in 1450. Carr&#x27;s parents were Francis Parker and Jesse (née Hallet) Carr. They were initially Conservatives, but went over to supporting the Liberals in 1903 over the issue of free trade. When Joseph Chamberlain proclaimed his opposition to free trade and announced in favour of Imperial Preference, Carr&#x27;s father, to whom all tariffs were abhorrent, switched his political loyalties.

Carr described the atmosphere at the Merchant Taylors School: &quot;95% of my school fellows came from orthodox Conservative homes, and regarded Lloyd George as an incarnation of the devil. We Liberals were a tiny despised minority.&quot; From his parents, Carr inherited a strong belief in progress as an unstoppable force in world affairs, and throughout his life a recurring theme in Carr&#x27;s thinking was that the world was progressively becoming a better place. In 1911, Carr won the Craven Scholarship to attend Trinity College at Cambridge. At Cambridge, Carr was much impressed by hearing one of his professors lecture on how the Greco-Persian Wars influenced Herodotus in the writing of the &quot;Histories&quot;. Carr found this to be a great discovery—the subjectivity of the historian&#x27;s craft. This discovery was later to influence his 1961 book &quot;What Is History?&quot;

== Diplomatic career ==
Like many of his generation, Carr found World War I to be a shattering experience as it destroyed the world he had known before 1914. He joined the British Foreign Office in 1916, resigning in 1936. Carr was excused from military service for medical reasons. He was at first assigned to the Contraband Department of the Foreign Office, which sought to enforce the blockade on Germany, and then in 1917 was assigned to the Northern Department, which amongst other areas dealt with relations with Russia. As a diplomat, Carr was later praised by the Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax as someone who had &quot;distinguished himself not only by sound learning and political understanding, but also in administrative ability&quot;.

At first, Carr knew nothing about the Bolsheviks. He later recalled of having some &quot;vague impression of the revolutionary views of Lenin and Trotsky&quot; but of knowing nothing of Marxism. By 1919, Carr had become convinced that the Bolsheviks were destined to win the Russian Civil War, and approved of the Prime Minister David Lloyd George&#x27;s opposition to the anti-Bolshevik ideas of the War Secretary Winston Churchill on the grounds of &quot;realpolitik&quot;. He later wrote that in the spring of 1919 he &quot;was disappointed when he [Lloyd George] gave way (in part) on the Russian question in order to buy French consent to concessions to Germany&quot;. In 1919, Carr was part of the British delegation at the Paris Peace Conference and was involved in the drafting of parts of the Treaty of Versailles relating to the League of Nations. During the conference, Carr was much offended at the Allied, especially French, treatment of the Germans, writing that the German delegation at the peace conference were &quot;cheated over the &#x27;Fourteen Points&#x27;, and subjected to every petty humiliation&quot;. 

Beside working on the sections of the Versailles treaty relating to the League of Nations, Carr was also involved in working out the borders between Germany and Poland. Initially, Carr favoured Poland, urging in a memo in February 1919 that Britain recognise Poland at once, and that the German city of Danzig (modern Gdańsk, Poland) be ceded to Poland. In March 1919, Carr fought against the idea of a Minorities Treaty for Poland, arguing that the rights of ethnic and religious minorities in Poland would be best guaranteed by not involving the international community in Polish internal affairs. By the spring of 1919, Carr&#x27;s relations with the Polish delegation had declined to a state of mutual hostility. Carr&#x27;s tendency to favour the claims of the Germans at the expense of the Poles led British-Polish historian Adam Zamoyski to note that Carr &quot;held views of the most extraordinary racial arrogance on all of the nations of Eastern Europe&quot;. Carr&#x27;s biographer, Jonathan Haslam, wrote that Carr grew up in a place where German culture was deeply appreciated, which in turn always coloured his views towards Germany throughout his life. As a result, Carr supported the territorial claims of fledgling Weimar Germany against Poland. In a letter written in 1954 to his friend Isaac Deutscher, Carr described his attitude to Poland at the time: &quot;The picture of Poland that was universal in Eastern Europe right down to 1925 was of a strong and potentially predatory power.&quot;

After the peace conference, Carr was stationed at the British Embassy in Paris until 1921, and in 1920 was awarded a CBE. At first, Carr had great faith in the League, which he believed would prevent both another world war and ensure a better post-war world. In the 1920s, Carr was assigned to the branch of the British Foreign Office that dealt with the League of Nations before being sent to the British Embassy in Riga, Latvia, where he served as Second Secretary between 1925 and 1929. In 1925, Carr married Anne Ward Howe, by whom he had one son. During his time in Riga (which at that time possessed a substantial Russian émigré community), Carr became increasingly fascinated with Russian literature and culture and wrote several works on various aspects of Russian life. Carr learnt Russian during his time in Riga, to read Russian writers in the original. In 1927, Carr paid his first visit to Moscow. He was later to write that reading Alexander Herzen, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and the work of other 19th-century Russian intellectuals caused him to re-think his liberal views. 

Starting in 1929, Carr began to review books relating to all things Russian and Soviet and to international relations in several British literary journals and, towards the end of his life, in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;. In particular, Carr emerged as the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;&#x27;s Soviet expert in the early 1930s, a position he still held at the time of his death in 1982. Because of his status as a diplomat (until 1936), most of Carr&#x27;s reviews in the period 1929–36 were published either anonymously or under the pseudonym &quot;John Hallett&quot;. In the summer of 1929, Carr began work on a biography of Fyodor Dostoyevsky and, in the course of researching Dostoevsky&#x27;s life, Carr befriended Prince D. S. Mirsky, a Russian émigré scholar living at that time in Britain. Beside studies on international relations, Carr&#x27;s writings in the 1930s included biographies of Dostoyevsky (1931), Karl Marx (1934), and Mikhail Bakunin (1937). An early sign of Carr&#x27;s increasing admiration of the Soviet Union was a 1929 review of Baron Pyotr Wrangel&#x27;s memoirs.

In an article entitled &quot;Age of Reason&quot; published in the &quot;Spectator&quot; on 26 April 1930, Carr attacked what he regarded as the prevailing culture of pessimism within the West, which he blamed on the French writer Marcel Proust. In the early 1930s, Carr found the Great Depression to be almost as profoundly shocking as the First World War. Further increasing Carr&#x27;s interest in a replacement ideology for liberalism was his reaction to hearing the debates in January 1931 at the General Assembly of the League of Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, and especially the speeches on the merits of free trade between the Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vojislav Marinkovich and the British Foreign Secretary Arthur Henderson. It was at this time that Carr started to admire the Soviet Union. In a 1932 book review of Lancelot Lawton&#x27;s &quot;Economic History of Soviet Russia&quot;, Carr dismissed Lawton&#x27;s claim that the Soviet economy was a failure, and praised the British Marxist economist Maurice Dobb&#x27;s extremely favourable assessment of the Soviet economy.

Carr&#x27;s early political outlook was anti-Marxist and liberal. In his 1934 biography of Marx, Carr presented his subject as a highly intelligent man and a gifted writer, but one whose talents were devoted entirely to destruction. Carr argued that Marx&#x27;s sole and only motivation was a mindless class hatred. Carr labelled dialectical materialism gibberish, and the labour theory of value doctrinal and derivative. He praised Marx for emphasising the importance of the collective over the individual. In view of his later conversion to a sort of quasi-Marxism, Carr was to find the passages in &quot;Karl Marx: A Study in Fanaticism&quot; criticising Marx to be highly embarrassing, and refused to allow the book to be republished. Carr was to later call it his worst book, and complained that he had written it only because his publisher had made a Marx biography a precondition for publishing the biography of Bakunin that he was writing. In his books such as &quot;The Romantic Exiles&quot; and &quot;Dostoevsky&quot;, Carr was noted for his highly ironical treatment of his subjects, implying that their lives were of interest but not of great importance. In the mid-1930s, Carr was especially preoccupied with the life and ideas of Bakunin. During this period, Carr started writing a novel about the visit of a Bakunin-type Russian radical to Victorian Britain who proceeded to expose all of what Carr regarded as the pretensions and hypocrisies of British bourgeois society. The novel was never finished or published.

As a diplomat in the 1930s, Carr took the view that great division of the world into rival trading blocs caused by the American Smoot–Hawley Act of 1930 was the principal cause of German belligerence in foreign policy, as Germany was now unable to export finished goods or import raw materials cheaply. In Carr&#x27;s opinion, if Germany could be given its own economic zone to dominate in Eastern Europecomparable to the British Imperial preference economic zone, the US dollar zone in the Americas, the French gold bloc zone, and the Japanese economic zonethen the peace of the world could be assured. In an essay published in February 1933 in the &quot;Fortnightly Review&quot;, Carr blamed what he regarded as a punitive Versailles treaty for the recent accession to power of Adolf Hitler. Carr&#x27;s views on appeasement caused much tension with his superior, the Permanent Undersecretary Sir Robert Vansittart, and played a role in Carr&#x27;s resignation from the Foreign Office later in 1936. In an article entitled &quot;An English Nationalist Abroad&quot; published in May 1936 in the &quot;Spectator&quot;, Carr wrote: &quot;The methods of the Tudor sovereigns, when they were making the English nation, invite many comparisons with those of the Nazi regime in Germany&quot;. In this way, Carr argued that it was hypocritical for people in Britain to criticise the Nazi regime&#x27;s human rights record. Because of Carr&#x27;s strong antagonism to the Treaty of Versailles, which he viewed as unjust to Germany, Carr was very supportive of the Nazi regime&#x27;s efforts to destroy Versailles through moves such as the remilitarisation of the Rhineland in 1936. Of his views in the 1930s, Carr later wrote: &quot;No doubt, I was very blind.&quot;

== International relations scholar ==
In 1936, Carr became the Woodrow Wilson Professor of International Politics at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, and is particularly known for his contribution on international relations theory. Carr&#x27;s last words of advice as a diplomat were a memo urging that Britain accept the Balkans as an exclusive zone of influence for Germany. Additionally, in articles published in &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; on 2 December 1936 and in the January 1937 edition of &quot;Fortnightly Review&quot;, Carr argued that the Soviet Union and France were not working for collective security but rather &quot;a division of the Great Powers into two armored camps&quot;, supported non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, and asserted that King Leopold III of Belgium had made a major step towards peace with his declaration of neutrality of 14 October 1936. Two major intellectual influences on Carr in the mid-1930s were Karl Mannheim&#x27;s 1936 book &quot;Ideology and Utopia&quot;, and the work of Reinhold Niebuhr on the need to combine morality with realism.

Carr&#x27;s appointment as the Woodrow Wilson Professor of International Politics caused a stir when he started to use his position to criticise the League of Nations, a viewpoint which caused much tension with his benefactor, Lord Davies, who was a strong supporter of the League. Lord Davies had established the Wilson Chair in 1924 with the intention of increasing public support for his beloved League, which helps to explain his chagrin at Carr&#x27;s anti-League lectures. In his first lecture on 14 October 1936 Carr stated that the League was ineffective.

In 1936, Carr began to work for Chatham House, where he chaired a study group tasked with producing a report on nationalism. The report was published in 1939.

In 1937, Carr visited the Soviet Union for a second time, and was impressed by what he saw. During his visit, Carr may have inadvertently caused the death of his friend, Prince D. S. Mirsky. Carr stumbled into Prince Mirsky on the streets of Leningrad (modern Saint Petersburg), and despite Prince Mirsky&#x27;s best efforts to pretend not to know him, Carr persuaded his old friend to have lunch with him. Since this was at the height of the &quot;Yezhovshchina&quot;, and any Soviet citizen who had any unauthorised contact with a foreigner was likely to be regarded as a spy, the NKVD arrested Prince Mirsky as a British spy; he died two years later in a Gulag camp near Magadan. As part of the same trip that took Carr to the Soviet Union in 1937 was a visit to Germany. In a speech given on 12 October 1937 at Chatham House summarising his impressions of those two countries, Carr reported that Germany was &quot;almost a free country&quot;. Apparently unaware of the fate of Prince Mirsky, Carr spoke of the &quot;strange behaviour&quot; of his old friend, who had at first gone to great lengths to try to pretend that he did not know Carr during their accidental meeting.

In the 1930s, Carr was a leading supporter of appeasement. In his writings on international affairs in British newspapers, Carr criticised the Czechoslovak President Edvard Beneš for clinging to the alliance with France, rather than accepting that it was his country&#x27;s destiny to be in the German sphere of influence. At the same time, Carr strongly praised the Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Józef Beck for his balancing act between France, Germany, and the Soviet Union. In the late 1930s, Carr started to become even more sympathetic toward the Soviet Union, as he was much impressed by the achievements of the Five-Year Plans, which stood in marked contrast to the failures of capitalism during the Great Depression.

His famous work &quot;The Twenty Years&#x27; Crisis&quot; was published in July 1939, which dealt with the subject of international relations between 1919 and 1939. In that book, Carr defended appeasement on the ground that it was the only realistic policy option. At the time the book was published in the summer of 1939, Neville Chamberlain had adopted his &quot;containment&quot; policy towards Germany, leading Carr to later ruefully comment that his book was dated even before it was published. In the spring and summer of 1939, Carr was very dubious about Chamberlain&#x27;s &quot;guarantee&quot; of Polish independence issued on 31 March 1939.
In &quot;The Twenty Years&#x27; Crisis&quot;, Carr divided thinkers on international relations into two schools, which he labelled the utopians and the realists. Reflecting his own disillusion with the League of Nations, Carr attacked as &quot;utopians&quot; those like Norman Angell who believed that a new and better international structure could be built around the League. In Carr&#x27;s opinion, the entire international order constructed at Versailles was flawed and the League was a hopeless dream that could never do anything practical. Carr described the opposition of utopianism and realism in international relations as a dialectic progress. He argued that in realism there is no moral dimension, so that for a realist what is successful is right and what is unsuccessful is wrong.

Carr contended that international relations was an incessant struggle between the economically privileged &quot;have&quot; powers and the economically disadvantaged &quot;have not&quot; powers. In this economic understanding of international relations, &quot;have&quot; powers like the United States, Britain and France were inclined to avoid war because of their contented status whereas &quot;have not&quot; powers like Germany, Italy and Japan were inclined towards war as they had nothing to lose. Carr defended the Munich Agreement as the overdue recognition of changes in the balance of power. In &quot;The Twenty Years&#x27; Crisis&quot;, he was highly critical of Winston Churchill, whom Carr described as a mere opportunist interested only in power for himself.

Carr immediately followed up &quot;The Twenty Years&#x27; Crisis&quot; with &quot;Britain: A Study of Foreign Policy From The Versailles Treaty to the Outbreak of War&quot;, a study of British foreign policy in the inter-war period that featured a preface by the Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax. Carr ended his support for appeasement, which he had so vociferously expressed in &quot;The Twenty Years&#x27; Crisis&quot;, with a favourable review of a book containing a collection of Churchill&#x27;s speeches from 1936 to 1938, which Carr wrote were &quot;justifiably&quot; alarmist about Germany. After 1939, Carr largely abandoned writing about international relations in favour of contemporary events and Soviet history. Carr was to write only three more books about international relations after 1939, namely &quot;The Future of Nations; Independence Or Interdependence?&quot; (1941), &quot;German-Soviet Relations Between the Two World Wars, 1919–1939&quot; (1951) and &quot;International Relations Between the Two World Wars, 1919–1939&quot; (1955). After the outbreak of World War II, Carr stated that he had been somewhat mistaken in his prewar views on Nazi Germany. In the 1946 revised edition of &quot;The Twenty Years&#x27; Crisis&quot;, Carr was more hostile in his appraisal of German foreign policy than he had been in the first edition in 1939.

Some of the major themes of Carr&#x27;s writings were change and the relationship between ideational and material forces in society. He saw as a major theme of history the growth of reason as a social force. He argued that all major social changes had been caused by revolutions or wars, both of which Carr regarded as necessary but unpleasant means of accomplishing social change.

== World War II ==
During World War II, Carr&#x27;s political views took a sharp turn towards the left. He spent the Phoney War working as a clerk with the propaganda department of the Foreign Office. As Carr did not believe that Britain could defeat Germany, the declaration of war on Germany on 3 September 1939 left him highly depressed.

In March 1940, Carr resigned from the Foreign Office to serve as the writer of leaders (editorials) for &quot;The Times&quot;. In his second leader, published on 21 June 1940 and entitled &quot;The German Dream&quot;, Carr wrote that Hitler was offering a &quot;Europe united by conquest&quot;. In a leader during the summer of 1940, Carr supported the Soviet annexation of the Baltic States.

Carr served as the assistant editor of &quot;The Times&quot; from 1941 to 1946, during which time he was well known for the pro-Soviet attitudes that he expressed in his leaders. After June 1941, Carr&#x27; s already strong admiration for the Soviet Union was much increased by the Soviet Union&#x27;s role in defeating Germany.

In a leader of 5 December 1940 entitled &quot;The Two Scourges&quot;, Carr wrote that only by removing the &quot;scourge&quot; of unemployment could one also remove the &quot;scourge&quot; of war. Such was the popularity of &quot;The Two Scourges&quot; that it was published as a pamphlet in December 1940, during which its first print run of 10,000 completely sold out. Carr&#x27;s left-wing leaders caused some tension with the editor of the &quot;Times&quot;, Geoffrey Dawson, who felt that Carr was taking the &quot;Times&quot; in too radical a direction, which led to Carr being restricted for a time to writing only on foreign policy. After Dawson was ousted in May 1941 and replaced with Robert M&#x27;Gowan Barrington-Ward, Carr was given a free rein to write on whatever he wished. In turn, Barrington-Ward was to find many of Carr&#x27;s leaders on foreign affairs to be too radical for his liking.

Carr&#x27;s leaders were noted for their advocacy of a socialist European economy under the control of an international planning board, and for his support for the idea of an Anglo-Soviet alliance as the basis of the post-war international order. Unlike many of his contemporaries in war-time Britain, Carr was against a Carthaginian peace with Germany, and argued for a post-war reconstruction of Germany along socialist lines. In his leaders on foreign affairs, Carr was very consistent in arguing after 1941 that, once the war ended, it was the fate of Eastern Europe to come into the Soviet sphere of influence, and claimed that any effort to the contrary was both vain and immoral.

Between 1942 and 1945, Carr was the Chairman of a study group at the Royal Institute of International Affairs concerned with Anglo-Soviet relations. Carr&#x27;s study group concluded that Stalin had largely abandoned Communist ideology in favour of Russian nationalism, that the Soviet economy would provide a higher standard of living in the Soviet Union after the war, and that it was both possible and desirable for Britain to reach a friendly understanding with the Soviets once the war had ended. In 1942, Carr published &quot;Conditions of Peace&quot;, followed by &quot;Nationalism and After&quot; in 1945, in which he outlined his ideas about how the post-war world should look. In his books, and his &quot;Times&quot; leaders, Carr urged for the creation of a socialist European federation anchored by an Anglo-German partnership that would be aligned with the Soviet Union against the United States.

In his 1942 book &quot;Conditions of Peace&quot;, Carr argued that it was a flawed economic system that had caused World War II and that the only way of preventing another world war was for the Western powers to adopt socialism. One of the main sources for ideas in &quot;Conditions of Peace&quot; was the 1940 book &quot;Dynamics of War and Revolution&quot; by the American Lawrence Dennis. In a review of &quot;Conditions of Peace&quot;, the British writer Rebecca West criticised Carr for using Dennis as a source, commenting: &quot;It is as odd for a serious English writer to quote Sir Oswald Mosley&quot;. In a speech on 2 June 1942 in the House of Lords, Viscount Elibank attacked Carr as an &quot;active danger&quot; for his views in &quot;Conditions of Peace&quot; about a magnanimous peace with Germany and for suggesting that Britain turn over all of her colonies to an international commission after the war.

The next month, Carr&#x27;s relations with the Polish government were further worsened by the storm caused by the discovery of the Katyn massacre committed by the Russian NKVD in 1940. In a leader entitled &quot;Russia and Poland&quot; on 28 April 1943, Carr blasted the Polish government for accusing the Soviets of committing the Katyn massacre and for asking the Red Cross to investigate.

Lord Davies, who had been extremely unhappy with Carr almost from the moment that Carr had assumed the Wilson Chair in 1936, launched a major campaign in 1943 to have Carr fired, being particularly upset that, although Carr had not taught since 1939, he was still drawing his professor&#x27;s salary. Lord Davies&#x27;s efforts to have Carr fired failed when a majority of the Aberystwyth staff, supported by the powerful Welsh political fixer Thomas Jones, sided with Carr.

In December 1944, when fighting broke out in Athens between the Greek Communist front organisation ELAS and the British Army, Carr in a &quot;Times&quot; leader sided with the Greek Communists, leading to Winston Churchill to condemn him in a speech to the House of Commons. Carr claimed that the Greek EAM was the &quot;largest organised party or group of parties in Greece&quot;, which &quot;appeared to exercise almost unchallengeable authority&quot;, and called for Britain to recognise the EAM as the legal Greek government.

In contrast to his support for EAM/ELAS, Carr was strongly critical of the legitimate Polish government in exile and its Armia Krajowa (Home Army) resistance organisation. In his leaders of 1944 on Poland, Carr urged that Britain break diplomatic relations with the London government and recognise the Soviet-sponsored Lublin government as the lawful government of Poland.

In a May 1945 leader, Carr blasted those who felt that an Anglo-American &quot;special relationship&#x27; would be the principal bulwark of peace. As a result of Carr&#x27;s leaders, the &quot;Times&quot; became popularly known during World War II as the three-pence &quot;Daily Worker&quot; (the price of the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; being one penny). Commenting on Carr&#x27;s pro-Soviet leaders, the British writer George Orwell wrote in 1942 that &quot;all the appeasers, e.g. Professor E. H. Carr, have switched their allegiance from Hitler to Stalin&quot;.

Reflecting his disgust with Carr&#x27;s leaders in the &quot;Times&quot;, the British civil servant Sir Alexander Cadogan, the Permanent Undersecretary at the Foreign Office, wrote in his diary: &quot;I hope someone will tie Barrington-Ward and Ted Carr together and throw them into the Thames.&quot;

During a 1945 lecture series entitled &quot;The Soviet Impact on the Western World&quot;, which was published as a book in 1946, Carr argued that &quot;The trend away from individualism and towards totalitarianism is everywhere unmistakable&quot;, that Marxism was the by far the most successful type of totalitarianism as proved by Soviet industrial growth and the Red Army&#x27;s role in defeating Germany, and that only the &quot;blind and incurable ignored these trends&quot;. During the same lectures, Carr called democracy in the Western world a sham, which permitted a capitalist ruling class to exploit the majority, and praised the Soviet Union as offering real democracy. One of Carr&#x27;s leading associates, the British historian R. W. Davies, was later to write that Carr&#x27;s view of the Soviet Union as expressed in &quot;The Soviet Impact on the Western World&quot; was a rather glossy and idealised picture.

== Cold War ==
In 1946, Carr started living with Joyce Marion Stock Forde, who was to remain his common law wife until 1964. In 1947, Carr was forced to resign from his position at Aberystwyth. In the late 1940s, Carr started to become increasingly influenced by Marxism. His name was on Orwell&#x27;s list, a list of people which George Orwell prepared in March 1949 for the Information Research Department, a propaganda unit set up at the Foreign Office by the Labour government. Orwell considered these people to have pro-communist leanings and therefore to be inappropriate to write for the IRD. In 1948, Carr condemned the British acceptance of an American loan in 1946 as marking the effective end of British independence. Carr went on to write that the best course for Britain was to seek neutrality in the Cold War and that &quot;peace at any price must be the foundation of British policy&quot;. Carr took a great deal of hope from the Soviet–Yugoslav split of 1948.

In May–June 1951, Carr delivered a series of speeches on British radio entitled &quot;The New Society&quot;, that advocated a commitment to mass democracy, egalitarian democracy, and &quot;public control and planning&quot; of the economy. Carr was a reclusive man whom few knew well, but his circle of close friends included Isaac Deutscher, A. J. P. Taylor, Harold Laski and Karl Mannheim. Carr was especially close to Deutscher. In the early 1950s, when Carr sat on the editorial board of Chatham House, he attempted to block the publication of the manuscript that eventually became &quot;The Origins of the Communist Autocracy&quot; by Leonard Schapiro on the ground that the subject of repression in the Soviet Union was not a serious topic for a historian. As interest in the subject of Communism grew, Carr largely abandoned international relations as a field of study. In 1956, Carr did not comment on the Soviet suppression of the Hungarian Uprising, while at the same time condemning the Suez War.

In 1966, Carr left Forde and married the historian Betty Behrens. That same year, Carr wrote in an essay that in India, where &quot;liberalism is professed and to some extent practised, millions of people would die without American charity. In China, where liberalism is rejected, people somehow get fed. Which is the more cruel and oppressive regime?&quot; One of Carr&#x27;s critics, the British historian Robert Conquest, commented that Carr did not appear to be familiar with recent Chinese history, because, judging from that remark, Carr seemed to be ignorant of the millions of Chinese who had starved to death during the Great Leap Forward. In 1961, Carr published an anonymous and very favourable review of his friend A. J. P. Taylor&#x27;s contentious book &quot;The Origins of the Second World War&quot;, which caused much controversy. In the late 1960s, Carr was one of the few British professors to be supportive of the New Left student protestors, whom, he hoped, might bring about a socialist revolution in Britain. Carr was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1967. In 1970, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Carr exercised wide influence in the field of Soviet studies and international relations. The extent of Carr&#x27;s influence could be seen in the 1974 &quot;festschrift&quot; in his honour, entitled &quot;Essays in Honour of E.H. Carr&quot; ed. Chimen Abramsky and Beryl Williams. The contributors included Sir Isaiah Berlin, Arthur Lehning, G. A. Cohen, Monica Partridge, Beryl Williams, Eleonore Breuning, D. C. Watt, Mary Holdsworth, Roger Morgan, Alec Nove, John Erickson, Michael Kaser, R. W. Davies, Moshe Lewin, Maurice Dobb, and Lionel Kochan.

In a 1978 interview in &quot;New Left Review&quot;, Carr called Western economies &quot;crazy&quot; and doomed in the long run. In a 1980 letter to his friend Tamara Deutscher, Carr wrote that he felt that the government of Margaret Thatcher had forced &quot;the forces of Socialism&quot; in Britain into a &quot;full retreat&quot;. In the same letter to Deutscher, Carr wrote that &quot;Socialism cannot be obtained through reformism, i.e. through the machinery of bourgeois democracy&quot;. Carr went on to decry disunity on the left. Although Carr regarded the abandonment of Maoism in China in the late 1970s as a regressive development, he saw opportunities and wrote to his stockbroker in 1978 that &quot;a lot of people, as well as the Japanese, are going to benefit from the opening up of trade with China. Have you any ideas?&quot;

== &quot;History of Soviet Russia&quot; ==
After the war, Carr was a fellow and tutor in politics at Balliol College, Oxford, from 1953 to 1955, when he became a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, where he remained until his death in 1982. During this period he published most of &quot;A History of Soviet Russia&quot; as well as &quot;What Is History?&quot;.

Towards the end of 1944, Carr decided to write a complete history of Soviet Russia from 1917 comprising all aspects of social, political and economic history to explain how the Soviet Union withstood the German invasion. The resulting work, his 14-volume &quot;History of Soviet Russia&quot; (14 vol., 1950–78), took the story up to 1929. Like many others, Carr argued that the emergence of Russia from a backward peasant economy to a leading industrial power was the most important event of the 20th century. The first part of the &quot;History of Soviet Russia&quot; comprised three volumes entitled &quot;The Bolshevik Revolution&quot;, published in 1950, 1952, and 1953, and traced Soviet history from 1917 to 1922. The second part was originally intended to comprise three volumes called &quot;The Struggle for Power&quot;, covering 1922–28, but Carr instead decided to publish a single volume labelled &quot;The Interregnum&quot; that covered the events of 1923–24, and another four volumes entitled &quot;Socialism in One Country&quot;, which took the story up to 1926. Carr&#x27;s final volumes in the series were entitled &quot;The Foundations of the Planned Economy&quot;, and covered the years until 1929. Carr had planned to take the series up to Operation Barbarossa in 1941 and the Soviet victory of 1945, but died before he could complete the project. Carr&#x27;s last book, 1982&#x27;s &quot;The Twilight of the Comintern&quot;, examined the response of the Comintern to fascism in 1930–1935. Although it was not officially a part of the &quot;History of Soviet Russia&quot; series, Carr regarded it as completing it. Another related book that Carr was unable to complete before his death, and was published posthumously in 1984, was &quot;The Comintern and the Spanish Civil War&quot;.

Another book that was not part of the &quot;History of Soviet Russia&quot; series, though closely related due to common research in the same archives, was Carr&#x27;s 1951 &quot;German-Soviet Relations Between the Two World Wars, 1919–1939&quot;. In it, Carr blamed British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain for the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of 1939. In 1955, a major scandal that damaged Carr&#x27;s reputation as a historian of the Soviet Union occurred when he wrote the introduction to &quot;Notes for a Journal&quot;, the supposed memoir of the former Soviet Foreign Commissar Maxim Litvinov that was shortly thereafter exposed as a KGB forgery. 

Carr was well known in the 1950s as an outspoken admirer of the Soviet Union. His friend and close associate, the British historian R. W. Davies, was to write that Carr belonged to the anti-Cold-War school of history, which regarded the Soviet Union as the major progressive force in the world, and the Cold War as a case of American aggression against the Soviet Union. The volumes of Carr&#x27;s &quot;History of Soviet Russia&quot; were received with mixed reviews. It was &quot;described by supporters as &#x27;Olympian&#x27; and &#x27;monumental&#x27; and by enemies as a subtle apologia for Stalin&quot;.

== &quot;What Is History?&quot; ==

Carr is also famous today for his work of historiography, &quot;What Is History?&quot; (1961), a book based upon his series of G. M. Trevelyan lectures, delivered at the University of Cambridge in January-March 1961. In this work, Carr argued that he was presenting a middle-of-the-road position between the empirical view of history and R. G. Collingwood&#x27;s idealism. Carr rejected as nonsense the empirical view of the historian&#x27;s work being an accretion of &quot;facts&quot; that he or she has at their disposal. Carr divided facts into two categories: &quot;facts of the past&quot;, that is, historical information that historians deem unimportant, and &quot;historical facts&quot;, information that historians have decided is important. Carr contended that historians quite arbitrarily determine which of the &quot;facts of the past&quot; to turn into &quot;historical facts&quot;, according to their own biases and agendas.

== Contribution to the theory of international relations ==
Carr contributed to the foundation of what is now known as classical realism in international relations theory. Carr&#x27;s work studied history (work of Thucydides and Machiavelli), and expressed a strong disagreement with what he referred to as Idealism. Carr juxtaposes realism and idealism. Hans Morgenthau, a fellow realist, wrote of Carr&#x27;s work that it &quot;provides a most lucid and brilliant exposure of the faults of contemporary political thought in the Western world... especially in so far as it concerns international affairs.&quot;

<text>The Clava cairn is a type of Bronze Age circular chamber tomb cairn, named after the group of three cairns at Balnuaran of Clava, to the east of Inverness in Scotland. There are about 50 cairns of this type in an area round about Inverness. They fall into two sub-types, one typically consisting of a corbelled passage grave with a single burial chamber linked to the entrance by a short passage and covered with a cairn of stones, with the entrances oriented south west towards midwinter sunset. In the other sub-type an annular ring cairn encloses an apparently unroofed area with no formal means of access from the outside. In both sub-types a stone circle surrounds the whole tomb and a kerb often runs around the cairn. The heights of the standing stones vary in height so that the tallest fringe the entrance (oriented south west) and the shortest are directly opposite it.

When Clava-type tombs still contained burial remains, only one or two bodies appear to have been buried in each, and the lack of access to the second sub-type suggests that there was no intention of re-visiting the dead or communally adding future burials as had been the case with Neolithic cairn tombs.

== Balnuaran of Clava ==

At Balnuaran of Clava itself there is a group of three Bronze Age cairns which lie close together in a line running north east to south west. The tombs at either end are of the passage grave sub-type. The central cairn is of the ring cairn sub-type, and uniquely has stone paths or causeways forming &quot;rays&quot; radiating out from the platform round the kerbs to three of the standing stones. The cairns incorporate cup and ring mark stones, carved before they were built into the structures. The kerb stones are graded in size and selected for colour, so that the stones are larger and redder to the south west, and smaller and whiter to the north east. All these elements seem to have been constructed as one operation and indicate a complex design rather than &quot;ad hoc&quot; additions.

<text>Hymiskviða (Old Norse: &#x27;The lay of Hymir&#x27;; anglicized as &quot;Hymiskvitha&quot;, &quot;Hymiskvidha&quot; or &quot;Hymiskvida&quot;) is a poem collected in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;. The poem was first written down in the late 13th century.

==Summary==
The Æsir consult their augury twigs and decide, since Ægir owns a lot of kettles for making beer, that he should be their host frequently. Ægir has to reluctantly agree, but as this will be a lot of work, he makes a condition (that he hopes they won&#x27;t be able to meet) that they bring a kettle large enough for him to make beer for all of them at once. That presents a problem, until Týr remembers a particularly large kettle in the possession of his father Hymir. So the Æsir set off. Eventually they find Hymir&#x27;s place, where Þórr (Thor) eats so much that Hymir and his guests have no alternative but to go fishing. The poem then tells the story of how Þórr almost caught the Jörmungandr, which is also recounted in the Prose Edda. Þórr shows off his strength, but Hymir taunts him and says that he could hardly be called strong if Þórr couldn&#x27;t break Hymir&#x27;s chalice. The chalice was a magic one and could not be broken unless slung against Hymir&#x27;s head. Þórr is eventually told so and proceeds to do it. Hymir is annoyed but says that they can take the kettle and leave. There follows the slaying of hordes of jötnar, whereupon the Æsir leave with the kettle and booze contentedly at Ægir&#x27;s place ever after (or at least until Lokasenna).

The poem contains fragments of a number of myths, and it shows. There is little structure to it, and scenes follow each other in a very rough logical order. Some of the allusions are not known from other sources and it contains unusually many kennings for an Eddic poem.

==Comparative mythology==
Similarities between the &quot;Hymiskviða&quot; and the Indian &quot;Samudra manthan&quot; have been pointed out by Georges Dumézil and others; see .

<doc id="681708" wikidata="Q321371" url="?curid=681708" title="Bosporan Kingdom">
<text>The Bosporan Kingdom, also known as the Kingdom of the Cimmerian Bosporus (; ), was an ancient Greco-Scythian state located in eastern Crimea and the Taman Peninsula on the shores of the Cimmerian Bosporus, centered in the present-day Strait of Kerch. It was the first truly &#x27;Hellenistic&#x27; state, in the sense that a mixed population adopted the Greek language and civilization, under aristocratic consolidated leadership. Under the Spartocid dynasty, the aristocracy of the kingdom adopted a double nature of presenting themselves as &quot;archons&quot; to Greek subjects and as kings to barbarians, which some historians consider unique in ancient history. The Bosporan Kingdom became the longest surviving Roman client kingdom. The 1st and 2nd centuries AD saw a period of a new golden age of the Bosporan state. It was briefly incorporated as part of the Roman province of Moesia Inferior from AD 63 to 68 under Emperor Nero, before being restored as a Roman client kingdom. At the end of the 2nd century AD, King Sauromates II inflicted a critical defeat on the Scythians and included all the territories of the Crimean Peninsula in the structure of his state.

The prosperity of the Bosporan Kingdom was based on the export of wheat, fish and slaves. As a result, the Kingdom became the economic center of the Black Sea and is often dubbed the ancient Jewel of the Black Sea. The profit of the trade supported a class whose conspicuous wealth is still visible from newly discovered archaeological finds, excavated, often illegally, from numerous burial barrows known as &quot;kurgans&quot;. The once-thriving cities of the Bosporus left extensive architectural and sculptural remains, while the kurgans continue to yield spectacular Greco-Sarmatian objects, the best examples of which are now preserved in the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg. These include gold work, vases imported from Athens, coarse terracottas, textile fragments, and specimens of carpentry and marquetry.

== Early Greek colonies==
The whole area was dotted with Greek cities: in the west, Panticapaeum (Kerch)—the most significant city in the region, Nymphaeum and Myrmekion; on the east Phanagoria (the second city of the region), Kepoi, Hermonassa, Portus Sindicus and Gorgippia.

These Greek colonies were originally settled by Milesians in the 7th and 6th centuries BC. Phanagoria (c. 540 BC) was a colony of Teos, and the foundation of Nymphaeum may have had a connection with Athens; at least it appears to have been a member of the Delian League in the 5th century.

==Geography ==

The Bosporan Kingdom was located between the Crimean and Taman peninsulas centered around the Kerch Strait, known in antiquity as the Cimmerian Bosporus, from which the kingdom&#x27;s name is derived. To south sat the Black Sea, a crossroads connecting Southeast Europe to the west, the Eurasian steppes to the north, the Caucasus and Central Asia to the east, Asia Minor and Mesopotamia to the south, and Greece to the southwest. To the north is the Sea of Azov, sometimes considered part of the Black Sea, with shallow waters and abundant rivers flowing toward it. 

Most of the kingdom fell in the Pontic-Caspian Steppe, a temperate grassland ideal for nomadic pastoralism. The south-eastern Crimean coastline is flanked by the Crimean mountains, with the highest peak being Roman-Kosh at 1,545 meters (5,069 ft.). Towards the west, the mountains drop steeply to the Black Sea, while to the east, they slowly develop into a steppe landscape. The southwestern coast of the Taman peninsula is bound by the Greater Caucasus half of the Caucasus Mountains.

== Economy ==
Greek colonization in the Black sea region dates back into the Greek Dark Ages, from which there is ample evidence of cultural and economic exchange as well as hostility between Greek and local populations, such as the Thracians, Dacians, and later Scythians. 

Scythian expansion and unification in the fifth century BC led to many of these settlements being wiped out or turned into Scythian protectorates, as was the case in the city of Olbia. It has been suggested that this pressure allowed the Archeanactid dynasty to create the first Bosporan state, lasting from 480-438 BC, at which point it was overthrown by the Spartocid Dynasty, beginning a period of economic expansion. 

The Black Sea Greeks before this period had dealt largely in goods like animals, slaves, furs, and fish, with grain playing a minor role. Stemming from conditions caused by the Peloponnesian War, the city of Athens had acquired a large demand for grain, and the strain on their empire meant they could do little about Spartocids attacking the city of Nymphaeum, on which they relied on for Black Sea trade. The Spartocids were willing to trade their grain with Athens in exchange for mainland goods and silver, which presumably furthered Athenian decline.

== Military ==
The Bosporan kingdom under the Spartocid kings was heavily influenced by the mixing of local Scythian and Greeks at all levels of society, particularly in the nobility. In an internal conflict between Satyrus II and his brother Eumelus, the royal Bosporan army was said to contain no more than two thousand Greeks, and an equal number of Thracians fighting as mercenaries. The vast majority of the army was Scythian, with ten thousand cavalry and more than twenty thousand infantry reported. Eumelus, allied with the Sirace king Aripharnes, brought twenty thousand Scythian cavalry and even more infantry.
==History==
=== Hellenistic period ===
The northern Black Sea underwent what some historians refer to as a &quot;long Hellenistic Age&quot; due to the institutions typically associated with the era occurring independently from the greater Greek world. Their relatively isolated position, and constant contact/conflict with barbarians along their borders, allowed monarchs with traditions rooted in the region to establish independent kingdoms from those of the successor states.  

=== Archaeanactidae dynasty ===
According to Greek historian Diodorus Siculus (xii. 31) the region was governed between 480 and 438 BC by a line of kings called the &quot;Archaeanactidae&quot;, probably a ruling family, usurped by a tyrant called Spartocus (438–431 BC). While Spartocus was traditionally considered to be a Thracian due to the family name, more recent historians have posited he was likely of Greco-Scythian descent, as was typical of the region.

===Spartocid dynasty===
Spartocus founded a dynasty which seems to have endured until c. 110 BC, known as the Spartocids. The Spartocids left many inscriptions, indicating that the earliest members of the house ruled under the titles of archons of the Greek cities and kings of various minor native tribes, notably the Sindi (from central Crimea) and other branches of the Maeotae. Surviving material (texts, inscriptions and coins) do not supply enough information to reconstruct a complete chronology of kings of the region.

Satyrus (431–387 BC), successor to Spartocus, established his rule over the whole region, adding Nymphaeum to his kingdom and besieging Theodosia, which was wealthy because, unlike other cities in the region, it had a port which was free of ice throughout the year, allowing it to trade grain with the rest of the Greek world, even in winter. Satyrus&#x27; son Leucon (387–347 BC) eventually took the city. He was succeeded jointly by his two sons, Spartocus II, and Paerisades; Spartocus died in 342 BC, allowing Paerisades to reign alone until 310 BC. After Paerisades&#x27; death, a war of succession between his sons Satyrus and Eumelus was fought. Satyrus defeated his younger brother Eumelus at the Battle of the River Thatis in 310 BC but was then killed in battle, giving Eumelus the throne.

Eumelus&#x27; successor was Spartocus III (303–283 BC) and after him Paerisades II. Succeeding princes repeated the family names, so it is impossible to assign them a definite order. The last of them, however, Paerisades V, unable to make headway against increasingly violent attacks from nomadic tribes in the area, called in the help of Diophantus, general of King Mithridates VI of Pontus, leaving him his kingdom. Paerisades was killed by a Scythian named Saumacus who led a rebellion against him.

The Spartocids were well known as a line of enlightened and wise princes; although Greek opinion could not deny that they were, strictly speaking, tyrants, they are always described as dynasts. They maintained close relations with Athens, their best customer for the Bosporan grain exports: Leucon I of Bosporus created privileges for Athenian ships at Bosporan ports. The Attic orators make numerous references to this. In return the Athenians granted Leucon Athenian citizenship and made decrees in honour of him and his sons.

After his defeat by Roman General Pompey in 66 BC, King Mithridates VI of Pontus fled with a small army from Colchis (modern Georgia) over the Caucasus Mountains to Crimea and made plans to raise yet another army to take on the Romans. His eldest living son, Machares, regent of Cimmerian Bosporus, was unwilling to aid his father, so Mithridates had Machares killed, acquiring the throne for himself. Mithridates then ordered the conscriptions and preparations for war. In 63 BC, Pharnaces, the youngest son of Mithridates, led a rebellion against his father, joined by Roman exiles in the core of Mithridates&#x27;s Pontic army. Mithridates VI withdrew to the citadel in Panticapaeum, where he committed suicide. Pompey buried Mithridates VI in a rock-cut tomb in either Sinope or Amasia, the capital of the Kingdom of Pontus.

===Roman client kingdom===
After the death of Mithridates VI (63 BC), Pharnaces II (63–47 BC) supplicated to Pompey, and then tried to regain his dominion during Julius Caesar&#x27;s Civil War, but was defeated by Caesar at Zela and was later killed by his former governor and son-in-law Asander.

Before the death of Pharnaces II, Asander had married Pharnaces II&#x27;s daughter Dynamis. Asander and Dynamis were the ruling monarchs until Caesar commanded a paternal uncle of Dynamis, Mithridates II to declare war on the Bosporan Kingdom and claimed the kingship for himself. Asander and Dynamis were defeated by Caesar&#x27;s ally and went into political exile. However, after Caesar&#x27;s death in 44 BC, the Bosporan Kingdom was restored to Asander and Dynamis by Caesar&#x27;s great nephew and heir Octavian. Asander ruled as an archon and later as king until his death in 17 BC. After the death of Asander, Dynamis was compelled to marry a Roman usurper called Scribonius, but the Romans under Agrippa intervened and established Polemon I of Pontus (16–8 BC) in his place. Polemon married Dynamis in 16 BC and she died in 14 BC. Polemon ruled as king until his death in 8 BC. After the death of Polemon, Aspurgus, the son of Dynamis and Asander, succeeded Polemon.

The Bosporan Kingdom of Aspurgus was a client state of the Roman Empire, protected by Roman garrisons. Aspurgus (8 BC – AD 38) founded a dynasty of kings which endured with a couple of interruptions until AD 341. Aspurgus adopted the Roman name &quot;Tiberius Julius&quot; when he received Roman citizenship and enjoyed the patronage of the first two Roman Emperors, Augustus and Tiberius. All of the following kings adopted these two Roman names followed by a third name, of Thracian (Kotys, Rhescuporis or Rhoemetalces) or local origin (such as Sauromates, Eupator, Ininthimeus, Pharsanzes, Synges, Terianes, Theothorses or Rhadamsades).
The Roman client kings of the dynasty had descended from King Mithridates VI of Pontus and his first wife, his sister Laodice, through Aspurgus. The kings adopted a new calendar (the &quot;Pontic era&quot;) introduced by Mithridates VI, starting with 297 BC to date their coins. Bosporan kings struck coinage throughout its period as a client state, which included gold staters bearing portraits of both the Roman emperor and Bosporan king. Like Roman coinage, Bosporan coinage became increasingly debased during the 3rd century. The coinage makes their lineages fairly clear to historians, though scarcely any events from their reigns are recorded.

The Bosporan Kingdom covered the eastern half of Crimea and the Taman peninsula, and extended along the east coast of the Maeotian marshes to Tanais at the mouth of the Don in the north-east, a great market for trade with the interior. Throughout the period there was perpetual war with the native tribes of Scythians and Sarmatians, and in this the Bosporan Kingdom was supported by its Roman suzerains, who lent the assistance of garrisons and fleets.
In AD 62 for reasons unknown, Roman emperor Nero deposed the Bosporan king Cotys I. It is possible that Nero wanted to minimize the power of local client rulers and wanted the Bosporans to be subsumed into the Roman empire. The Bosporan Kingdom was incorporated as part of the Roman province of Moesia Inferior from 63 to 68. In 68, the new Roman emperor Galba restored the Bosporan Kingdom to Rhescuporis I, the son of Cotys I.

Following the Jewish diaspora, Judaism emerged in the region, and Jewish communities developed in some of the cities of the region (especially Tanais). The Jewish or Thracian influence on the region may have inspired the foundation of a cult to the &quot;Most High God&quot;, a distinct regional cult which emerged in the 1st century AD, which professed monotheism without being distinctively Jewish or Christian.

The balance of power among the local tribes was severely disturbed by westward migration in the 3rd–4th centuries. In the 250s AD, the Goths and Borani were able to seize Bosporan shipping and even raid the shores of Anatolia.

=== Fate of the kingdom ===
There are no known coins from the Bosporan Kingdom after the last ones minted by Rhescuporis VI in 341, which makes constructing a chronology very difficult. Though the kingdom is traditionally believed to have been destroyed at the end of his reign by the Goths and the Huns, there is no concrete evidence for this. There is an inscription by a Bosporan ruler named Douptounos from 483, nearly a century and a half after Rhescuporis VI, which makes it unlikely that the kingdom and its line of kings came to an end in the mid-4th century. Additionally, archaeological data from the time indicate a period with a growing economy rather than societal collapse. 

Because of evidence of their increasing prominence in the Crimea, it is possible that Rhescuporis was overthrown by a Sarmatian or Alan tribal leader, who established his own dynasty on the Bosporan throne. It is known that the Goths later held power in the Crimea, from 380 onwards, since a 404 letter to John Chrysostom, archbishop of Constantinople, refers to the local ruler as a &quot;rex Gothiorum&quot; (&quot;king of the Goths&quot;). The Gothic Bosporan realm likely became a vassal of the Hunnic Empire, regaining its independence after the empire&#x27;s collapse in the 450s and 460s. The Byzantine historian Procopius describes the Goths of Crimea fighting against and then allying with the Utigurs, indicating that Gothic control of the region lasted for some time after the departure of the Huns. Despite the waves of barbarian domination, the late Bosporus remained an ancient Hellenistic state in language, culture and traditions; the local material culture from the third to sixth centuries is distinguished both by its great complexity and by syncretism, intertwining both ancient and new barbarian elements.

Through some means, the Goths appear to have left or been driven away, leading to the resumption of local self-rule in the late 5th century under rulers such as Douptounos, who re-oriented the kingdom towards the Byzantine Empire as a client state. Such a re-orientation is also evidenced by the presence of Byzantine coins in the Crimea, including coinage of emperors Justin I () and Justinian I (). By Justinian&#x27;s time, the Bosporus was under a barbarian ruler once more: the Hunnic ruler Gordas. Though Gordas maintained good relations with Justinian, he was killed in a revolt in 527, which led the emperor to send armies to the Bosporus, conquering the lands of the kingdom and establishing imperial control there. 

The Bosporan cities enjoyed a revival, under Byzantine and Bulgarian protection. The ancient Greek city of Phanagoria became the capital of Old Great Bulgaria between 632 and 665. The town of Tmutarakan, on the eastern side of the strait, became the seat of the Kievan Rus principality of Tmutarakan in the 10th and 11th centuries, which in turn gave way to Tatar domination. From time to time Byzantine Greek officers built fortresses and exercised authority at Bosporus, which constituted an archbishopric. A relevant Byzantine usage of the term is found in a newly discovered seal of a general of the early 11th century as of &quot;&quot;, i.e., of the Cimmerian Bosporos. Also, in the early 12th century reference is made of the Byzantine Empire&#x27;s reassertion of control over the Cimmerian Bosporos (.

==Coinage==

Although considered rare among collectors prior to the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991, Bosporan coins are now well known on the international coin markets, hinting at the quantities produced. Several large series were produced by Bosporan cities from the 5th century BC, particularly in Panticapaeum. Gold staters of Panticapaeum bearing Pan&#x27;s head and a griffin are especially remarkable for their weight and fine workmanship.

There are coins with the names of the later Spartocids and a complete series of dated solidi issued by the later or Achaemenian dynasty. In them may be noticed the swift degeneration of the gold solidus through silver and potin to bronze.

<text>Jonathan Leslie Powell (born 25 April 1947) is an English former television producer and executive. His senior positions in television included serving as the Head of BBC Drama Series and Serials and Controller of BBC1. He later became a professor and head of department of Media Arts at Royal Holloway, University of London.

==Biography==

Powell was educated at Sherborne School and the University of East Anglia where he studied English literature. In 1968, he began working in television drama, producing programmes such as &quot;Crown Court&quot;. Working for the BBC, he produced several drama series during the 1970s and 1980s, including literary adaptations such as &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (1977), &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (1978), &quot;Testament of Youth&quot; (1979), &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; (1980), &quot;The Barchester Chronicles&quot; (1982) and &quot;The Old Men at the Zoo&quot; (1983). He was also the producer of &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; (1979) and its sequel &quot;Smiley&#x27;s People&quot; (1982), both starring Alec Guinness as George Smiley.

In late 1983, he was made Head of Drama Series and Serials at BBC Television. He oversaw a period of change in BBC drama, with more original programmes being produced as well as classic adaptations, and more programmes being made on film rather than in the BBC TV studios on videotape. While Powell was heading BBC drama series, the soap operas &quot;EastEnders&quot; and &quot;Howards&#x27; Way&quot; were launched (both in 1985) and the medical drama &quot;Casualty&quot; (1986). In 1985, he and BBC1 controller Michael Grade attempted to cancel &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. In common with Grade, Powell had a low opinion of the series and especially despised its producer, John Nathan-Turner, whom, he later said, he wanted to &quot;fuck off... or die, really&quot;. After an outcry from the series&#x27; fans and a tabloid campaign, this decision became an 18-month hiatus instead.

His most prominent television post came in 1987 when he succeeded Grade as the Controller of BBC1. While he was Controller, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; came to the end of its first run in 1989, although Head of Series Peter Cregeen cancelled the programme. Powell was responsible for commissioning &quot;Eldorado&quot;, a new soap opera that debuted in 1992. It lasted only a year, becoming critically and popularly regarded as a costly fiasco and an embarrassment for the BBC. He remained channel controller until 1993, when he left the BBC to join the independent company Carlton Television as Director of Drama and Co-Production.

After he retired from television, Powell became Head of the Department of Media Arts at Royal Holloway, University of London.

<doc id="681721" wikidata="Q1412196" url="?curid=681721" title="Carmen figuratum">
<text>Carmen figuratum (plural: &quot;carmina figurata&quot;) is a poem that has a certain shape or pattern formed either by all the words it contains or just by certain ones therein. An example is France Prešeren&#x27;s &quot;Zdravljica&quot;, where the shape of each stanza resembles a wine cup. The term derives from the &quot;carmina figurata&quot; of Renaissance texts – works in which a sacred image was picked out in red letters against a field of black type so that a holy figure could be seen and meditated on during the process of reading. The carmina figurata also spread in the Carolingian period in order to spread the use and study of Latin.

<text>Cruciform passage graves describe a complex example of prehistoric passage grave found in Ireland, west Wales and Orkney and built during the later Neolithic, from around 3500 BC and later.

They are distinguished by a long passage leading to a central chamber with a corbelled roof. From this, burial chambers extend in three directions, giving the overall impression in plan of a cross shape layout. Some examples have further sub-chambers leading off the three original chambers. The network of chambers is covered by a cairn and revetted with a kerb.

A common trait is megalithic art carved into the stones of the chambers&#x27; walls and roofs. Abstract designs were favoured, especially spirals and zig-zags.

Examples are Newgrange in Ireland, Maeshowe in Orkney and Barclodiad y Gawres in Anglesey.

<text>Highway 23 is a north–south highway that straddles the Columbia River in the Columbia Country region of British Columbia, Canada. Its section north of Revelstoke is formerly known as the Big Bend Highway and was part of the original routing of Highway 1. The Big Bend area was well known as there was a gold rush there, beginning in 1864. Travelers used canoes or river steamers until a dirt-surfaced highway was built on the east bank around the Big Bend, from Revelstoke to Golden, from 1930 to 1937, opening officially in 1940, and it served as the trans-provincial highway until 1962 when the Rogers Pass portion of the Trans-Canada Highway was opened.

Highway 23 was initially opened in 1964, and it was re-aligned through the latter half of the 1960s. Realignment of the highway also occurred in the early 1980s, in anticipation of the creation of the reservoir for the Revelstoke Dam (Revelstoke Lake), which flooded lower parts of the highway.

==Route details==
Highway 23, which is long, begins in the south at Nakusp, where it meets Highway 6. Highway 23 winds north along the eastern shore of Upper Arrow Lake for to its junction with Highway 31 at Galena Bay. The Upper Arrow Lake Ferry continues Highway 23 across Upper Arrow Lake to a location known as Shelter Bay. North of Shelter Bay, Highway 23 follows the west bank of the Columbia River for to where it meets the Trans-Canada Highway. Highway 23 follows the Trans-Canada east through the city of Revelstoke for 1 km (0.62 mi), finally turning north after leaving Revelstoke.

North of Revelstoke, Highway 23 entirely follows the east bank of Revelstoke Lake for , past the old townsite of Mica Creek to its northern terminus at the Mica Dam facility.

<text>Wangen an der Aare is a municipality in the Oberaargau administrative district in the canton of Bern in Switzerland.

On 1 January 2024 the former municipality of Wangenried merged to form the municipality of Wangen an der Aare.

This small town lies between Olten and Solothurn in rural surroundings on the Aare, a major river of the west-central lowland region of Switzerland, the &quot;Mittelland&quot;. An ancient wooden covered bridge crosses the Aare at this point. Wangen an der Aare was the administrative centre of the former district of the same name.
==Transport links==
Wangen is situated on the Biel/Bienne - Olten railway line and close to the A1 motorway.

==History==
Wang(en) means an area at the foot of a slope; in this case the slope in question is almost certainly that of the nearby Jura mountain range. Wangen&#x27;s coat of arms shows crossed St Peter&#x27;s keys in blue on a white ground. The nobles (or &quot;Vögte&quot;) who held the lordship of Wangen adopted this symbol which had been the badge of the Upper Aargau estates of the Abbey of Saint Peter in the Black Forest. The earliest document to be sealed with the crossed-keys symbol dates from the year 1380.

The castle, built by the Kyburger dynasty in 1407, became the seat of the Bernese regional governorship, and some departments of the regional administration are still housed in the building today. The settlement occupied a strategically important spot, guarding the river-crossing and serving as a customs and staging-point for waterway traffic on the Aare. When the latter trade came to an end the little town experienced a serious economic crisis. The salt house of 1775 remains today as a testament to this past.

==Geography==

Wangen has an area of . Of this area, 42.8% is used for agricultural purposes, while 28.8% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 20.3% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (8.1%) is non-productive (rivers, glaciers or mountains).

==Demographics==
Wangen has a population (as of ) of . , 12.5% of the population was made up of foreign nationals. Over the last 10 years the population has grown at a rate of 7.4%. Most of the population () speaks German (91.0%), with Albanian being second most common ( 3.0%) and Serbo-Croatian being third ( 2.4%).

In the 2007 election the most popular party was the SVP which received 39.2% of the vote. The next three most popular parties were the FDP (25.4%), the SPS (15.8%) and the Green Party (6.7%).

The age distribution of the population () is children and teenagers (0–19 years old) make up 24% of the population, while adults (20–64 years old) make up 59.6% and seniors (over 64 years old) make up 16.4%. In Wangen about 75.3% of the population (between age 25-64) have completed either non-mandatory upper secondary education or additional higher education (either university or a &quot;Fachhochschule&quot;).

Wangen has an unemployment rate of 1.76%. , there were 53 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 18 businesses involved in this sector. 240 people are employed in the secondary sector and there are 37 businesses in this sector. 673 people are employed in the tertiary sector, with 107 businesses in this sector.

== Notable people ==
* Arnold Rikli (1823 in Wangen an der Aare – 1906) a Swiss natural healer, he proposed exposing the body to sun and air, called sun tanning

== Army base ==
The modern-day Swiss Army base at Wangen is a link to the town&#x27;s history as a military centre. The base grew up around the riverside warehouses, where field howitzer units were stationed in World War I. Today Wangen an der Aare is the Transport Corps&#x27; main centre and a training-place for disaster relief and rescue units. The Corps of Engineers&#x27; bridge-builders, the Pontoniers, also train here.

==Economy==

The bedware company Roviva Roth &amp; Cie. AG developed from a horsehair spinning-mill first mentioned in 1748.

<text>A restrictor plate or air restrictor is a device installed at the intake of an engine to limit its power. This kind of system is occasionally used in road vehicles (e.g., motorcycles) for insurance purposes, but mainly in automobile racing, to limit top speed to provide equal level of competition, and to lower costs; insurance purposes have also factored in for motorsports.

== Racing series ==
A few top classes like Formula One limit only the displacement and air intake mouth dimension. However, in 2006 air restrictors (as well as rev limiters) were used by Scuderia Toro Rosso to facilitate the transition to a new engine formula.

Many other racing series use additional air restrictors.

* Formula 3, 2000cc, 215 hp
* Formula SAE, 710cc, 20 mm restrictor.
* Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters, 4000cc, 470 hp
* FIA GT Championship (now FIA GT1 World Championship) and other series using FIA GT regulations
* Le Mans Prototypes used in American Le Mans Series and Le Mans Series have restrictors based on precalculated tables depending on the type and size of the engine and fuel
** The ALMS in the 2010 season combines both LMP1 and LMP2 into a single LMP class on all races except 12 Hours of Sebring and Petit Le Mans; LMP1-categorized cars use a 5% smaller air restrictor compared to LMP2- categorized cars to balance performance in the races

== Rallying ==
After Group B cars were outlawed from rallying because they were too powerful (rumored to have reached 600 hp), too fast and too dangerous, the FISA decided that rally cars should not have more than . For a while no special restrictions were needed for that (e.g. the Group A Lancia Delta HF 4WD had about 250 hp in 1987). But with development in the 1990s, Group A cars were rumored to have reached 405 hp or more. So the FIA mandated restrictors for supercharged and turbocharged engines in all categories (World Rally Car, Group A and Group N).

This means that the rally version of a car like the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution may have less power than the street version (the &quot;280&quot; hp Evo VII was believed to have more than 300 hp, and in some markets the FQ-320, FQ-340, FQ-360, FQ-400 versions were sold, with the number representing the total horsepower).

It also means that the torque and power curves of the engine are unusual. The engine produces peak torque and almost maximum power at a relatively low RPM, and from there to the rev limiter the torque drops and the power does not increase much.

In 1995 Toyota Team Europe used an illegal device to bypass the restrictor (allowing an estimated extra 50 hp).
Due to this the team lost their results in the 1995 season and was banned from rallying until the end of 1996.

== NASCAR ==
The NASCAR Cup Series and Xfinity Series have mandated the use of restrictor plates at Daytona International Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway since 1988, and until the 2019 Daytona 500 for Cup Series only. The plates were put into use in 1988 as a result of a wreck in the 1987 Winston 500 at Talladega that involved the car of Bobby Allison crashing into the frontstretch catch fence at a high enough speed to destroy almost 100 feet of the fence and put the race under a red flag condition for two hours. The following race at Talladega that year would be run with a smaller carburetor, however, NASCAR mandated the use of the restrictor plate at the end of the season.

The restrictions are in the interest of driver and fan safety because speeds higher than the 190 mph range used for Daytona and Talladega risk cars turning over through sheer aerodynamic forces alone. The severity of crashes at higher speeds is also much greater, shown by telemetry readings of wrecks such as Elliott Sadler at Pocono Raceway and Michael McDowell at Texas Motor Speedway that were far higher than registered on restrictor plate tracks. Drivers such as Rusty Wallace have cited data showing that the roof flaps used on the cars cannot keep them on the ground above 204 mph.

The drawback to the use of the restrictor plates has been the increased size of packs of cars caused by the decreased power coupled with the drag the vehicles naturally produce. At Daytona and Talladega, most races are marred by at least one wreck, usually referred to as &quot;the Big One&quot;, as cars rarely become separated. Talladega has been considered the more likely track for these instances to occur as the track is incredibly wide, enough to have three to four distinct lines of cars running side by side. With the new pavement at Daytona, three-wide racing became far easier, and multi-car wrecks became more common. The 2011 Daytona 500 saw a record number of cautions including an early 17-car pile-up. These wrecks tend to be singled out for criticism despite multicar crashes at other tracks and the generally greater severity of impact on non-restricted tracks. In addition, the packs were far smaller in 1988 through 1990 until more teams mastered the nuances of this kind of racing and improved their cars (and drivers) accordingly.

The 2011 Sprint Cup season was the last complete Cup season with carbureted engines; at the end of the 2011 season, NASCAR announced that it would change to an electronic fuel injection system for the 2012 racing season. The injection system used by NASCAR is a different system from that used in IndyCar Racing and other motorsports series; the EFI system that NASCAR put into use was compatible with the old restrictor plates, allowing NASCAR to continue to use them to keep the speeds lower at the superspeedways and save costs for race teams. The restrictor plates were bolted beneath a throttle body that sits in the same place as the former carburetors.

The last race with the original restrictor plates was the 2019 Daytona 500; after that race, the cars moved to a variable-sized tapered spacer already used at all other tracks, with the exception that the spacer would have smaller holes than the ones used at the smaller tracks, to ensure speeds stay under 200 mph. The shape of the spacer helps a car funnel more air smoothly into the manifold, increasing fuel performance, while ensuring airflow is still restricted. With that change, NASCAR also mandated the use of larger rear spoilers, larger front splitters, and specially-placed front end aero ducts. The combination of those features increased drag on the cars, counteracting the increased horsepower, keeping the cars close to the speeds they were running prior to the switch to the tapered spacer. While the racing quality noticeably improved, and passing was made easier with larger horsepower and bigger runs, speeds also noticeably increased past 200 mph, and even into 205 mph ranges. 

Starting in 2022, restrictor plate rules were used for Atlanta Motor Speedway because of concerns over speed after the circuit was repaved and reconfigured to 28 degree banking.

=== Reason for restrictor plates ===
NASCAR used restrictor plates first in 1970 as part of a phased transition from the seven-litre era (427 cubic inch) to the six-litre era (358 cubic inch) engine that would be in effect at the end of the 1973 season. Following testing and input from drivers such as David Pearson, Bobby Isaac, and Bobby Allison, NASCAR mandated the use of a restrictor plate for the big block seven-litre engines. Small block engines, in the 358 cubic inch range (which is still used today in NASCAR), were exempt from the plates; the first car to race with a small block engine was Dick Brooks at the 1971 Daytona 500, where he ran a 1969 Dodge Daytona with a five-litre engine (to be exact, 305 CID). The transition period lasted until 1974, when the current 358 cubic inch (5870cc) limit was imposed. As the early 1970s use of restrictor plates was considered a transitional process, and as not every car used restrictor plates, this is not what most fans call &quot;restrictor plate racing&quot;. This is similar to the 2006 Formula One season, where teams using V10 engines were run with air restrictors and rev limiters while teams running V8 engines were not.

The second use came following the crash of Bobby Allison at the 1987 Winston 500 at Talladega Superspeedway. Allison&#x27;s Buick LeSabre blew a tire going into the tri-oval at , spun around and became airborne, flying tail-first into the catch fencing. While the car did not enter the grandstands it tore down nearly 100 feet of fencing and flying debris injured several spectators. After a summer where the two subsequent superspeedway races were run with smaller carburetors (390 cubic feet per minute (cfm) instead of 830 cfm) proved to be inadequate to sufficiently slow the cars, NASCAR imposed restrictor plates again, this time at the two fastest circuits, both superspeedways: Daytona for all NASCAR-sanctioned races and Talladega for Cup races. The Automobile Racing Club of America also enforced restrictor plates at their events at the two tracks. In 1992, when the Busch Grand National series began racing at Talladega, the plates were implemented, in keeping with their use at Daytona.

NASCAR&#x27;s concerns with speeds because of power-to-weight ratios result in restrictor plates at other tracks. The Goody&#x27;s Dash Series (known now as the ISCARS series with its new ownership) used restrictor plates at Bristol during at least the last years of the series&#x27; existence when the cars were using six-cylinder engines (compared to the traditional four cylinder engines), in addition to their Daytona races.

However, restrictor plates were not initially used for Camping World Truck Series trucks. Rather, aerodynamic air intake reduction through the use of a 390 cfm carburetor, and eventually a tapered carburetor spacer were implemented for those races. Combined with the aerodynamic disadvantage of the trucks, this allowed NASCAR to avoid the use of such equipment for the trucks until 2008. In 2008, the Nationwide Series (now known as Xfinity Series) and Truck Series began implementation of tapered spacers in the engines to restrict power compared to Sprint Cup cars at all 35 (NNS) and 25 (NCTS) races. Both these NASCAR series now use a restrictor plate and tapered spacer at the two tracks.

The third use came in 2000. Following fatal crashes of Adam Petty and Kenny Irwin Jr. at the New Hampshire International Speedway during the May Busch Series and July Winston Cup Series races, respectively, NASCAR adopted a one-inch (2.54 cm) restrictor plate to slow the cars headed towards the tight turns as part of a series of reforms to alleviate stuck throttle problems which were alleged to have caused both fatal crashes. For the Winston Cup race, it was used just once at the 2000 Dura Lube 300. Jeff Burton led all 300 laps in the ensuing race, despite a 23-car two-abreast battle in the first ten laps, a dramatic charge past 22 cars in 100 laps by John Andretti (who finished seventh), and two charges by Bobby Labonte in the final 50 laps where he took the lead but Burton beat him back to the stripe. The use of restrictor plates, intended as an emergency measure pending a more permanent replacement in any event, was discontinued at New Hampshire for the following race for Cup only. However, the Modifieds still use a restrictor plate because the speeds are too great for that class of racecar without them. The track has since been changed with SAFER Barriers to improve racing safety. Restrictor plates remain a permanent fixture on the Modifieds and the racing has often broken 20 official lead changes for 100–125 laps of competition.

Rusty Wallace tested a car at Talladega Superspeedway without a restrictor plate in 2004, reaching a top speed of in the backstretch and a one-lap average of . While admitting excitement at the achievement, Wallace also conceded, &quot;There&#x27;s no way we could be out there racing at those speeds... it would be insane to think we could have a pack of cars out there doing that.&quot;

In 2016, following a series of uncompetitive races at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, NASCAR began a series of tests for the Xfinity Series using a smaller restrictor plate than used at Daytona and Talladega and aerodynamic aids. After the tests were successful, the rules package was imposed for the 2017 race at Indianapolis. For 2018, the package is being used at Indianapolis, Michigan, and Pocono for the Xfinity Series and in the All-Star Race in the Cup Series.

=== The competitive quality of restrictor plate racing ===
A frequent criticism of restrictor plates is the enormous size of packs in races, with &quot;Big One&quot; wrecks as noted above singled out for condemnation despite the greater violence of smaller-scale crashes on unrestricted tracks. In restrictor plate racing, the packs have brought about an often-enormous increase in positional passing; at Talladega Superspeedway, the Sprint Cup cars have surpassed 40 official lead changes sixteen times from 1988 onward, including both 2010 Sprint Cup races at Talladega, which had 87 official lead changes in the regulation 188 laps. (The 2010 Aaron&#x27;s 499 had 88 lead changes, but the 88ththe race-winning pass by Kevin Harvickwas on the last lap of the third attempt at a green-white-checkered finish). Daytona International Speedway has generally been less competitive because the age of the asphalt (the track was repaved in 1978 and again in 2010) has reduced grip for the cars and thus handling has impeded passing ability to a significant extent. The 2000 New Hampshire race was criticized because Jeff Burton led wire to wire; the plates were singled out as impeding ability to pass, a criticism contradicted by the use of restrictor plates in a Busch North support race the day before, where the lead changed seven times in 100 laps, and by the highly competitive nature of restrictor plated Modified races; as noted above, the 300 also saw a 23-car battle for third in the first ten laps and a burst by 22 cars from John Andretti.

The criticism stems from reduction in throttle response brought by the restriction. The reduction in throttle response, however, has never been shown to have impeded ability to pass; the criticism was shot down in the first &quot;modern&quot; plate race, the 1988 Daytona 500, as the lead changed 25 times officially and saw several bursts where the lead changed several times a lap and also several bursts of sustained side-by-side racing, notably in the final 50 laps between Bobby Allison, Darrell Waltrip, Neil Bonnett, and Buddy Baker.

Said Waltrip before the race, &quot;I feel, as a driver, now I can do more than I could before [the plates]. Now, instead of a car just blasting by me with a burst of speed and a lot of horsepower, he&#x27;s got to think his way, he got to &quot;drive&quot; his way around me.&quot;

In the transitional years (1971–76) where the seven-litre engines (430 cu in) had restrictor plates, Daytona and Talladega broke 40 official lead changes six times, while Michigan International Speedway broke 35 official lead changes in both of its 1971 races.

<text>A hawza () or ḥawzah ʿilmīyah () is the collective term (plural hawzat) for a &quot;madrasa&quot; (i.e. seminary) where Shi&#x27;a Muslim scholars are educated.

The word &quot;ḥawzah&quot; is found in Arabic as well as the Persian language. In Arabic, the word means &quot;to hold something firmly&quot;. Accordingly, &quot;ḥawzah ʿilmīyah&quot; would mean a place where the firm knowledge (of the Muslim religion) is acquired. In the Persian language, &quot;ḥawzah&quot; refers to the middle part of a place or an area. &quot;Ḥawzah ʿilmīyah&quot; in Persian, therefore, means &quot;the place of knowledge&quot;. Another meaning of the word is &quot;circle of knowledge&quot;.

Several senior Grand Ayatollahs constitute the hawza. The institutions in Najaf, Iraq and Qom, Iran, are the preeminent seminary centers for the education of Shi&#x27;a scholars. However, several smaller hawzas exist in other cities around the world, such as at Karbala, Iraq, Isfahan and Mashhad in Iran, Beirut, Lebanon, Lucknow, India, Lahore, Pakistan, Europe and North America.

In countries with sharia courts such as Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, a hawza also functions as a law school for those wanting to practice law in Islamic courts.
==Hawza &#x27;Ilmiyya Najaf==
Hawza &#x27;Ilmiyya in Najaf, Iraq was established in 430 AH (the 11th century AD) by Shaykh al-Tusi (385 AH/995 CE – 460 AH/1067 CE), and continued as a center of study until the establishment of modern Iraq in 1921. At present Ayatollah Sistani heads Hawza &#x27;Ilmiyya Najaf, which includes two other Ayatollahs - Mohammad Ishaq Al-Fayyad and Bashir al-Najafi. After witnessing a peak of some 20,000 students in the 60s, then around 3000 because of the State repression, since 2003, the Najaf hawza has now more than 13,000 students, while the curriculum has been updated to include many modern subjects as well as inter faith and inter sectarian initiatives.

==Hawza &#x27;Ilmiyya Qom==

Although large Shi&#x27;a academies existed in Qom dating back as early as 10th century CE, the hawza of the city became prominent at the time of the Safavids when Shi&#x27;a Islam became the official religion of Iran. The famous teachers of that era included Mulla Sadra and Shaykh Bahai. The modern Qom hawza (since 1340 AH/1921 CE) was revitalized by Abdul Karim Haeri Yazdi and Grand Ayatollah Borujerdi and is barely a century old. As of 1975, major madrasas in Qom which offered religious education included 
*Ḥaqqānī (founded 1964), 
*the traditional Fayżīya, 
*Ḵān, 
*Ḥojjatīya, and 
*Rażawīya, 
traditional madrasas which incorporate some modern elements in the curricula include: 
*Dār al-tablīḡ (1965), 
*Golpāyegānī (1965), and 
*Imam Amīr-al-Moʾmenīn (1975),
Since the revolution of 1979 new madrasas have been founded in Qom, including 
*MaʿṢūmīya and 
*Maktab-e Zahrā.

==Hawza &#x27;Ilmiyya Khwaharan (Women&#x27;s Hawza)==

There are also a number of women&#x27;s hawza, mostly located in Iran. Already in the early 1800s, the Salehiyya madrasa in Qazvin ran a women&#x27;s section where several female mujtahids were trained. In Qom, the earliest seminary for women was established by the grand ayatollah Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari, who in 1973 added a women&#x27;s section to his hawza Dar al-Tabligh, called Dar al-Zahra. Next, the Haghani school opened a women&#x27;s wing in 1974/75, called Maktab-e Tawhid.

Outside Qom, women&#x27;s seminaries included Maktab-e Fatema of Fasa (opened in 1961), Maktab-e Zahra of Shiraz (opened in 1964), Maktab-e Fatimah of Isfahan (opened by Lady Amin in 1965), Zahra-i Athar of Tehran (opened in 1966), and Madrase-ye &#x27;Elmīyya Narges of Mashhad (opened in 1966).

After the 1979 revolution in Iran, the state began to centralize the women&#x27;s hawza system. The women&#x27;s seminaries in Qom were centralized into one large school, the Jamiat al-Zahra. In Khorasan with its clerical center of Mashhad, the women&#x27;s maktabs came under the aegis of the state-run Centre for Management of Women&#x27;s Seminaries of Khorasan. In the rest of the country, women&#x27;s seminaries were integrated into the Centre for Management of Women&#x27;s Seminaries (Markaz-e Modiriat-e Ḥawzahā-ye ʿElmiyya Khwaharān). Since the mid-1990s the latter center has established more than 300 seminaries across Iran (before the revolution less than a dozen existed in the entire country).

== Hawza &#x27;Ilmiyya in the West ==
There are also a number of &quot;ḥawzah&quot; in the West particularly in the United Kingdom. One of longest established hawza in the UK is Al-Mahdi Institute (AMI). Founded in 1993 by Shaykh Arif Abdulhussain, who received &quot;ijāza&quot; of &quot;ijtihād&quot; from Ayatollah Hussain Amini and Ayatollah Professor Sayyid Mostafa Mohaghegh Damad, Al-Mahdi Institute began as an Islamic educational institute (hawza) with the objective of combining traditional seminarian scholarship with modern academic study approaches. 

The Hawza Programme is at the core of AMI&#x27;s educational offerings. Modeled on the curriculums of the &quot;ḥawzah&quot; of Qom and Najaf, it offers training in classical Islamic sciences, employing a critical and academic approach. Courses are primarily taught in English with Arabic language instruction. The programme culminates in eligibility for a Master&#x27;s degree in Islamic Studies from the University of Birmingham. Additionally, AMI&#x27;s &#x27;Transfer Student Scheme&#x27; enables students from other Islamic institutions to also join the programme and pursue the MA degree.

==Hawza subjects==
Hawza students begin their studies by learning fiqh, kalam, hadith, tafsir, philosophy, natural and abstract sciences as well as Arabic and Arabic literature. Once these studies have been completed, they may begin preparation to become a mujtahid by studying advanced old textbooks known as &quot;sat&#x27;h&quot;, and research courses known as &quot;kharij&quot;.

Subjects studied at the hawza may include the following:

# Falsafa (Islamic philosophy)
# Fiqh (jurisprudence)
# &#x27;Ilm al-Hadith (traditions)
# Ilm al-Kalam (theology)
# &#x27;Ilm ar-Rijal (evaluation of biographies)
# &#x27;Irfan (Islamic mysticism)
# Mantiq (Logic)
# Lugha (language studies)
# Tafsir al-Qur&#x27;an (interpretation of the Qur&#x27;an)
# Tarikh (history)
# &#x27;Ulum al-Qur&#x27;an (Qur&#x27;an sciences)
# Usul al-Fiqh (principles of jurisprudence)

==Advanced subjects==
Once the basic studies have been completed, students may begin preparation to become a mujtahid by studying advanced ancient textbooks known as &quot;sat&#x27;h&quot;, and research courses known as &quot;kharij&quot;.

To be a mujtahid one has to excel in the advanced levels of the Hawza including &quot;Muqad&#x27;dim&#x27;maat&quot;, &quot;Sotooh&quot;, &quot;Sotooh &#x27;Ulya&quot;,&quot; &#x27;Uloom Ukhra&quot; and &quot;Bahath Kharij&quot;.

&quot;Bahath-e Kharij&quot; is the last level of hawzah and this level leads to Marja&#x27;iya, to become a marja&#x27; one has to teach &quot;dars-e khaarij&quot; for considerable amount of time, publish collection of juridical edicts (&quot;risala &#x27;amaliyya&quot;) and become recognised as one (by established &quot;Maraji&quot;).

<doc id="681741" wikidata="Q1431527" url="?curid=681741" title="County of Boulogne">
<text>The County of Boulogne was a county within the Kingdom of France during the 9th to 15th centuries, centred on the city of Boulogne-sur-Mer. It was ruled by the counts of Flanders in the 10th century, but a separate House of Boulogne emerged during the 11th century. It was merged into the County of Artois by Philip II of France in 1212 and eventually annexed to the royal domain itself in 1477.

==History==
Boulogne was already a &quot;pagus&quot; within the kingdom of the Franks (&quot;pagus Bononiensis&quot;), but there are few records prior to the 11th century. A proverbially wicked count named Herrequin is recorded for the 9th century, but he may be legendary (see Herla, Erlking). It seems to have come under the rule of the counts of Flanders in the late 9th or early 10th century. In 886, bishop Gauzlin of Paris asked count Erkenger of Boulogne to solicit German help against the Viking raids. Erkenger lost all his possessions in 896, as he remained loyal to Charles the Simple. It may have been at this point that Baldwin II, Count of Flanders, gained control over Boulogne.

Eustace II of Boulogne accompanied William the Conqueror&#x27;s invasion in 1066. Boulogne was also a major participant in the First Crusade; Eustace III of Boulogne&#x27;s brothers, Godfrey of Bouillon and Baldwin of Bouillon, both became kings of Jerusalem, and Eustace himself was offered but declined the title.

Count Renaud of Boulogne joined the imperial side at the Battle of Bouvines in 1214, and he was defeated by Philip II of France.

Boulogne passed under nominal royal control in 1223 when it was given to Philip II&#x27;s son Philip Hurepel. Hurepel revolted against Blanche of Castile when Louis VIII of France died in 1226. When Philip Hurepel died in 1235, Matilda continued to reign and in 1238 was married to Alphonse, second son of King Alfonso II of Portugal, and younger brother of King Sancho II of Portugal. Having become Afonso III of Portugal in 1248 and renounced his title of Count of Boulogne, Alfonse divorced her in 1253 due to her barrenness in favour of Beatrice of Castile.

Nevertheless, Matilda and Philip did have a son Alberic, and a daughter Joan who both survived. Alberic reportedly renounced his rights and went to England, for unknown reasons. Apparently he survived his mother and died in 1284, but presumably did not leave issue. Joan was married in 1236 to Gaucher de Châtillon, Count of Mortain (d. 1251). She predeceased her mother in 1252, and presumably left no surviving issue.

Consequently, after Matilda, her county of Boulogne then passed to Matilda&#x27;s niece, Adelaide of Brabant and her husband William X of Auvergne.

Bertrand V de la Tour succeeded to the counties of Auvergne and of Boulogne in 1437. Through his son Bertrand VI de la Tour the County of Boulogne passed to his grandson, the last medieval count of Boulogne: Jean III de la Tour d&#x27;Auvergne. By his marriage to Jeanne of Bourbon-Vendôme, he left two daughters:
*The eldest daughter, Anne of la Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, married John Stewart, Duke of Albany, however she died childless in 1524.
*The youngest, Madeleine de La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne married Lorenzo II de&#x27; Medici and gave birth to Catherine de&#x27; Medici, who inherited both Auvergne and Boulogne due to the death of the childless Anne.

The representatives of the County joined in the Netherlands the Estates General of 1464 in Bruges. At the death of Charles the Bold the King of France claimed the end of the dependency of Boulogne from the County of Artois, causing new struggles against the Habsburg. The treaty of Senlis closed the problem: France lost Artois to the Empire, while the Habsburg renounced to Boulogne.

In 1477, Bertrand II dealt with Louis XI, exchanging the county of Boulogne with the county of Lauragais. Boulogne, so became part of the royal domain.

<text>&quot;There were 156,000 people who reported Native Hawaiian with no additional detailed NHPI group or race group and an additional 371,000 people who reported Native Hawaiian in combination with one or more other races and/or detailed NHPI groups. Thus, a total of 527,000 people reported Native Hawaiian alone or in any combination.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Native Hawaiians (also known as Indigenous Hawaiians, Kānaka Maoli, Aboriginal Hawaiians, or simply Hawaiians; , , , and ) are the Indigenous Polynesian people of the Hawaiian Islands.

Hawaii was settled at least 800 years ago by Polynesians who sailed from the Society Islands. The settlers gradually became detached from their homeland and developed a distinct Hawaiian culture and identity in their new home. They created new religious and cultural structures, in response to their new circumstances and to pass knowledge from one generation to the next. Hence, the Hawaiian religion focuses on ways to live and relate to the land and instills a sense of community.

The Hawaiian Kingdom was formed in 1795, when Kamehameha the Great, of the then-independent island of Hawaiʻi, conquered the independent islands of Oʻahu, Maui, Molokaʻi, and Lānaʻi to form the kingdom. In 1810, Kauaʻi and Niʻihau joined the Kingdom, the last inhabited islands to do so. The Kingdom received many immigrants from the United States and Asia. The Hawaiian sovereignty movement seeks autonomy or independence for Hawaii.

In the 2010 U.S. census, people with Native Hawaiian ancestry were reported to be residents in all 50 of the U.S. states, as well as Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. Within the U.S. in 2010, 540,013 residents reported Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander ancestry alone, of which 135,422 lived in Hawaii. In the United States overall, 1.2 million people identified as Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, either alone or in combination with one or more other races. The Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander population was one of the fastest-growing groups between 2000 and 2010.

==History==
The history of &quot;Kānaka Maoli&quot;, like the history of Hawaii, is commonly broken into four major periods:
* the pre-unification period (before )
* the unified monarchy and republic period ( to 1898)
* the U.S. territorial period (1898 to 1959)
* the U.S. statehood period (1959 to present)

===Origins===
One theory is that the first Polynesians arrived in Hawaii in the 3rd century from the Marquesas by travelling in groups of waka, and were followed by Tahitians in AD 1300, who conquered the original inhabitants. Another is that a single, extended period of settlement populated the islands. Evidence for Tahitian conquest include the legends of Hawaiiloa and the navigator-priest Paao, who is said to have made a voyage between Hawaii and the island of &quot;Kahiki&quot; (Tahiti) and introduced many customs. Early historians, such as Abraham Fornander and Martha Beckwith, subscribed to this Tahitian invasion theory, but later historians, such as Patrick Kirch, do not mention it. King Kalākaua claimed that Paao was from Samoa.

Some writers claim that earlier settlers in Hawaii were forced into remote valleys by newer arrivals. They claim that stories about the Menehune, little people who built heiau and fishponds, prove the existence of ancient peoples who settled the islands before the Hawaiians, although similar stories exist throughout Polynesia.

==Demographics==

At the time of Captain Cook&#x27;s arrival in 1778, the population is estimated to have been between 250,000 and 800,000. This was the peak of the Native Hawaiian population. During the first century after contact, &quot;Kānaka Maoli&quot; were nearly wiped out by diseases brought by immigrants and visitors. &quot;Kānaka Maoli&quot; had no resistance to influenza, smallpox, measles, or whooping cough, among others. These diseases were similarly catastrophic to indigenous populations in the Americas. 

The current 293,000 include dual lineage Native Hawaiian and mixed lineage/multi-racial people. This was the highest number of any &quot;Kānaka Maoli&quot; living on the island until 2014, a period of almost 226 years. This long spread was marked by an initial die-off of 1-in-17, which would gradually increase to almost 8–10 dying from contact to the low point in 1950. 

The 1900 U.S. census identified 37,656 residents of full or partial Native Hawaiian ancestry. The 2000 U.S. census identified 283,430 residents of Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander ancestry, showing a steady growth trend over the century.

===Diaspora===
Some Hawaiians left the islands during the period of the Hawaiian Kingdom. For example, Harry Maitey became the first Hawaiian in Prussia.

Also noteworthy as leaving the Hawaiian kingdom was Palawai, Lanai born native Hawaiian Kiha Ka’awa who was adopted as a young man by Sandwich Islands Mormon Missionary President George Nebeker and emigrated with King Lunalilo permission to the mainland US, thus making Kiha Ka’awa (adopted Nebeker) the first native Hawaiian (Kanaka Maoli) to become a US citizen in 1873 prior to Hawaii’s annexation. Kiha Ka’awa stayed in the US until his death December 26th 1931. 

The Native Hawaiian population has increased outside the state of Hawaii, with states such as California and Washington experiencing dramatic increases in total population. Due to a notable Hawaiian presence in Las Vegas, the city is sometimes called the &quot;Ninth Island&quot; in reference to the eight islands of Hawaii.

== Culture and arts ==
Several cultural preservation societies and organizations were established. The largest is the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum, established in 1889 and designated as the Hawaiʻi State Museum of Natural and Cultural History. The museum houses the largest collection of native Hawaiian artifacts, documents, and other information. The museum has links with major colleges and universities throughout the world to facilitate research.

The Polynesian Voyaging Society reignited interest in Polynesian sailing techniques, both in ship construction and in instrument-free navigation. The Society built multiple double-hulled canoes, beginning with &quot;Hōkūlea&quot; and followed by &quot;Makali&#x27;i,&quot; &quot;Alingano Maisu,&quot; and &quot;Mo‘okiha O Pi‘ilani.&quot; The canoes and their worldwide voyages contributed to the renewal and appreciation of Hawaiian culture.

===Religion and society===

Native Hawaiian culture grew from their Polynesian roots, creating a local religion and cultural practices. This new worship centered on the ideas of land (&quot;aina&quot;) and family (&quot;ohana&quot;). Land became a sacred part of life and family. Hawaiian religion is polytheistic, but mostly focuses on the gods Wākea and Papahānaumoku, the mother and father of the Hawaiian islands. Their stillborn child formed the deep roots of Hawaii, and whose second child, Hāloa, is the god from whom all Hawaiians originate.

Hawaiian culture is caste-oriented, with specific roles based on social standing. Caste roles are reflected in how land was controlled.

=== Land tenure ===
Each island was divided into &quot;moku&quot;, which were given to people of high standing and kept within the family. Each &quot;moku&quot; was split into smaller &quot;ahupua&#x27;a&quot;, each of which extended from the sea to the top of the nearest mountain. This was to ensure that each &quot;ahupua&#x27;a&quot; provided all necessary resources for survival, including hardwoods and food sources. Each &quot;ahupua&#x27;a&quot; was managed by managers, who were charged by the island chief to collect tributes from the residents. Splits of the &quot;ahupua&#x27;a&quot; were based on the level of tribute. The major subdivisions were &quot;&#x27;Ili&quot;. Each &quot;&#x27;Ili&quot; gave a tribute to the chief of the &quot;ahupua&#x27;a&quot; and another to the island chief. In contrast to the European system of feudalism, Hawaiian peasants were never bound to the land and were free to move as they chose.

&quot;Kānaka Maoli&quot; refer to themselves as &quot;kama&#x27;aina&quot;, a word meaning &quot;people of the land&quot;, because of their connection to and stewardship of the land. It was also part of the spiritual belief system that attributes their origin to the land itself. This is reinforced by the cultivation of taro, a plant that is said to be the manifestation of Hāloa. The represents the deep roots that tether Hawaiians to the islands, as well as symbolizing the branching networks that Hawaiian people created.

===Hula===
Hula is one of Hawai&#x27;is best-known indigenous artforms. Traditionally, hula was a ritualistic dance performed to honor the gods and goddesses. Hula is typically categorized as either &quot;Hula Kahiko&quot; or &quot;Hula ʻAuana&quot;. Each hula tells a story via its movements and gestures.

&quot;Hula Kahiko&quot; is a traditional style. Its interpretive dance is known for its grace and romantic feel. Dances are accompanied by percussion instruments and traditional chanting. The traditional instruments include the &quot;pahu hula&quot;, &quot;kilu&quot; or &quot;puniu&quot;, &quot;ipu&quot;, &quot;hano&quot; or &quot;phe hano ihu&quot;, &quot;ka&quot;, &quot;pu&quot;, &quot;oeoe&quot;, &quot;pahupahu kaekeeke&quot;, &quot;hokio&quot;, and &quot;wi&quot;. Dancers add to the effect using &quot;uli&quot;, &quot;puili&quot;, &quot;iliili&quot;, &quot;papahehi&quot;, and &quot;kalaau&quot;.

&quot;Hula ʻAuana&quot; was influenced by later Western factors. It is accompanied by non-traditional musical instruments and colorful outfits. It became popularized with tourists and it is this form that is most widely practiced beyond the islands. Ukuleles and guitars are common.

===Holidays===
The Hawaiian people celebrate traditions and holidays. The most popular form of celebration in Hawaii is the Lūʻau. A lūʻau is a traditional Hawaiian banquet, commonly featuring foods such as &quot;poi&quot;, &quot;poke&quot;, &quot;lomi-lomi&quot; salmon, &quot;kalua&quot; pig, &quot;haupia&quot;, and entertainment such as ukulele music and hula. 

One of the most important holidays is Prince Kuhio Day. Celebrated every year since 1949 on his birthday (March 26), the holiday honors Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, a Congressman who succeeded in helping Native Hawaiian families become landowners. It is celebrated with canoe races and luaus across the islands. Every June 11 &quot;Kānaka Maoli&quot; celebrate King Kamehameha day. Kamehameha I was the king who unified the islands and established the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi. He was known as a fearless warrior, wise diplomat, and the most respected leader in the history of the Hawaiian monarchy. The holiday is celebrated with parades and lei draping ceremonies, where &quot;Kānaka Maoli&quot; bring &quot;lei&quot; (flower necklaces) to King Kamehameha statues located across the islands and drape them from his cast bronze arms and neck to honor his contributions to the people of Hawaiʻi.

==Hawaiian cultural revival==

Native Hawaiian culture underwent a renaissance beginning in the 1970s. It was in part triggered by the 1978 Hawaiʻi State Constitutional Convention, held 200 years after the arrival of Captain Cook. At the convention, state government committed itself to the study and preservation of Hawaiian culture, history, and language.

Hawaiian culture was introduced into Hawaiʻi&#x27;s public schools, teaching Hawaiian art, lifestyle, geography, hula, and Hawaiian language. Intermediate and high schools were mandated to teach Hawaiian history to all their students.

Many aspects of Hawaiian culture were commercialized to appeal to visitors from around the world. This includes hula, use of the word &quot;Aloha&quot;, &quot;lei&quot;, and the assimilation of Hawaiian culture into non-native lifestyles. This has provided significant financial support for cultural practices, while emphasizing aspects that have popular appeal over those that respect tradition. 

Statutes and charter amendments were passed acknowledging a policy of preference for Hawaiian place and street names. For example, with the closure of Barbers Point Naval Air Station in the 1990s, the region formerly occupied by the base was renamed Kalaeloa.

===Activism===

While Native Hawaiian protest has a long history, beginning just after the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom, many notable protests came during or after the Hawaiian cultural revival. These include the Kalama Valley protests, the Waiāhole-Waikāne struggle, the Kahoolawe island protests, and protests over the presence and management of astronomical observatories atop Hawaii&#x27;s mountains, most notably the Thirty Meter Telescope protests.

==Hawaiian language==
===Hawaiian Traditional Language===
The Hawaiian language (or ʻ&quot;Ōlelo Hawaiʻi&quot;) was once the language of native Hawaiian people; today, &quot;Kānaka Maoli&quot; predominantly speak English. A major factor for this change was an 1896 law that required that English &quot;be the only medium and basis of instruction in all public and private schools&quot;. This law excluded the Hawaiian language from schools. In spite of this, some &quot;Kānaka Maoli&quot; (as well as non-&quot;Kānaka Maoli&quot;) learned &quot;ʻŌlelo Hawaii&quot;. As with other Hawaii locals, &quot;Kānaka Maoli&quot; typically speak Hawaiian Creole English (referred to locally as Pidgin) in daily life. Pidgin is a creole that developed during the plantation era in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, mixing words and diction from the various ethnic groups living in Hawaii then.

&quot;ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi&quot; later became an official language of the State of Hawaii, alongside English. The state enacted a program of cultural preservation in 1978. Programs included Hawaiian language immersion schools, and a Hawaiian language department at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. Ever since, Hawaiian language fluency has climbed among all races.

In 2006, the University of Hawaiʻi at Hilo established a masters program in Hawaiian, and in 2006, a Ph.D program. It was the first doctoral program established for the study of any pre-contact language in the United States.

Hawaiian is the primary language of the residents of Niʻihau.

===Hawai&#x27;i Sign Language===

Alongside &quot;&#x27;Ōlelo Hawai&#x27;i&quot;, some &quot;Maoli&quot; spoke the little studied Hawai&#x27;i Sign Language.

==Education==

In Hawaii, the public school system is operated by the Hawaiʻi State Department of Education rather than local school districts. Under the administration of Governor Benjamin J. Cayetano from 1994 to 2002, the state&#x27;s educational system established Hawaiian language immersion schools. In these schools, all courses are taught in the Hawaiian language and incorporate Hawaiian subject matter. These schools are not exclusive to native Hawaiians.

&quot;Kānaka Maoli&quot; are eligible for an education from Kamehameha Schools (KS), established through the last will and testament of Bernice Pauahi Bishop of the Kamehameha Dynasty. The largest and wealthiest private school system in the United States, KS was intended to benefit orphans and the needy, with preference given to &quot;Kānaka Maoli&quot;. The schools educate thousands of children of native Hawaiian children ancestry and offers summer and off-campus programs not restricted by ancestry. KS practice of accepting primarily gifted students, has been controversial in the native Hawaiian community. Many families feel that gifted students could excel anywhere, and that the Hawaiian community would be better served by educating disadvantaged children to help them become responsible community contributors.

Many &quot;Kānaka Maoli&quot; attend public schools or other private schools.

==Office of Hawaiian Affairs==
==Federal developments==

===United States annexation===
In 1893, during the Hawaiian rebellions of 1887–1895 and after the ascension of Queen Liliuokalani to the Hawaiian Throne in 1891, Sanford Dole created the &quot;Committee of Safety&quot; overthrew the monarchy. This was in part due to the Queen&#x27;s rejection of the 1887 Constitution, which severely limited her authority. This diminished traditional governance and installed a US-backed, plantation-led government. One reason for the overthrow was over Kalākaua&#x27;s unwillingness to sign the amended Treaty of Reciprocity that would have damaged Hawaiian trade, and opened up part of &#x27;Oahu for the Pearl Harbor military base.

The event was challenged by Grover Cleveland, but was eventually supported by President William McKinley in his Manifest Destiny plan, which harmed indigenous peoples in the continental United States and Hawai&#x27;i. The change left &quot;Kānaka Maoli&quot; as the only major indigenous group with no &quot;nation-to-nation&quot; negotiation status and without any degree of self determination.

===Native American Programs Act===
In 1974, the Native American Programs Act was amended to include &quot;Kānaka Maoli&quot;. This paved the way for &quot;Kānaka Maoli&quot; to become eligible for some federal assistance programs originally intended for continental Native Americans. Today, Title 45 CFR Part 1336.62 defines a Native Hawaiian as &quot;an individual any of whose ancestors were natives of the area which consists of the Hawaiian Islands prior to 1778&quot;.

===United States apology resolution===
On November 23, 1993, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed United States Public Law 103–150, also known as the Apology Resolution, which had previously passed Congress. This resolution &quot;apologizes to &quot;Kānaka Maoli&quot; on behalf of the people of the United States for the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii&quot;.

===Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2009===
In the early 2000s, the Congressional delegation of the State of Hawaiʻi introduced the Native Hawaiian Federal Recognition Bill (Akaka bill), an attempt to recognize and form a Native Hawaiian government entity to negotiate with state and federal governments. The bill would establish, for the first time, a formal political and legal relationship between a Native Hawaiian entity and the US government. Proponents consider the legislation to be an acknowledgement and partial correction of past injustices. They included Hawaiʻi&#x27;s Congressional delegation, as well as former Governor Linda Lingle. Opponents include the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, (who doubted the constitutionality of creating a race-based government), libertarian activists, (who challenged the accuracy of claims of injustice), and other Native Hawaiian sovereignty activists, (who claimed that the legislation would prevent complete independence from the United States).

A Ward Research poll commissioned in 2003 by the Office of Hawaiian Affairs reported that &quot;Eighty-six percent of the 303 Hawaiian residents polled by Ward Research said &#x27;yes.&#x27; Only 7 percent said &#x27;no,&#x27; with 6 percent unsure ... Of the 301 non-Hawaiians polled, almost eight in 10 (78 percent) supported federal recognition, 16 percent opposed it, with 6 percent unsure.&quot; A Zogby International poll commissioned in 2009 by the Grassroot Institute of Hawaii indicated that a plurality (39%) of Hawaiʻi residents opposed it and that 76% indicated that they were unwilling to pay higher taxes to offset any resulting tax revenue loss due to the act.

The bill did not pass.

===Ka Huli Ao: Center for Excellence in Native Hawaiian Law===
In 2005, with the support of U.S. Senator Daniel Inouye, federal funding through the Native Hawaiian Education Act created the Center for Excellence in Native Hawaiian Law at UH Mānoa William S. Richardson School of Law. The program became known as Ka Huli Ao: Center for Excellence in Native Hawaiian Law. 

Ka Huli Ao focuses on research, scholarship, and community outreach. Ka Huli Ao maintains a social media presence and provides law students with summer fellowships. Law school graduates are eligible to apply for post-J.D. fellowships.

===Department of Interior Self-Governance Proposal===
In 2016, the Department of Interior (DOI), under the direction of Secretary Sally Jewell, started the process of recognizing the Hawaiians&#x27; right to self governance and the ability for nation-to-nation negotiation status and rights. This created opposition from the Hawaiian Sovereignty movement who believed that &quot;Kānaka Maoli&quot; should not have to navigate US structures to regain sovereignty and viewed the process as incomplete. The outcome ultimately allowed nation-to-nation relationships if &quot;Kānaka Maoli&quot; created their own government and sought that relationship. The government formation process was stopped by Justice Anthony Kennedy, using his earlier precedent in &quot;Rice v. Cayetano&quot; that &quot;ancestry was a proxy for race&quot; in ancestry-based elections, but the voting itself was not stopped.

===Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month===
The United States government has permanently designated the month of May to be Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month; before 2021 it was known as Asian Pacific American Heritage Month.

===Native Hawai&#x27;ian Community Consultation Policy===
On October 18, 2022, the Department of Interior published a press release announcing the establishment of a new policy that would require the federal government to formally consult the Native Hawai&#x27;ian Community in order to &quot;further affirm and honor the special political and trust relationship between the United States and the Native Hawaiian Community.&quot; Secretary Deb Haaland noted in the press release that the new consultation policy would assist in upholding the sovereignty and right to self-determination Native Hawai&#x27;ian communities have.

In addition to bi-annual meetings between the Secretary and representatives of Native Hawai&#x27;ian organizations on &quot;matters of mutual interest&quot;, as well as mandatory training, the Consultation policy requires federal agencies to consult the Native Hawai&#x27;ian Community before engaging in any actions that &quot;have the potential to significantly affect Native Hawaiian resources, rights, or lands by correspondingly charging the Office with fully integrating the policy and practice of meaningful consultation by such Federal agencies.&quot; 
Its proposal explained the unique relationship Native Hawai&#x27;ians have with the US gov&#x27;t, defined as &quot;government-to-sovereign&quot; and recognized in 150 statutes: the unrelinquished sovereignty Native Hawai&#x27;ians have legally in the absence of a &quot;government-to-government&quot; relationship.

===Violence Against Women Act===
In December 2022, the Violence Against Women Act was amended to include &quot;Kānaka Maoli&quot; survivors of gender-based violence and Native Hawaiian organizations in grant funding.

==Notable &quot;Kānaka Maoli&quot;==

In 1873, the first &quot;Kānaka Maoli&quot; were given permission from King Lunalilo (prior emigration of &quot;Kānaka Maoli&quot; outside of the Sandwich Islands was not allowed) to permanently emigrate to the United States (Salt Lake City, Utah). They were Kiha Kaʻawa, and Kahana Pukahi. Kiha was adopted by Mormon Sandwich Islands (Hawaiian islands) Missionary President George Nebeker upon arriving to the US, thus making Kiha Kaʻawa (adopted surname Nebeker) the very first native Hawaiian to become a U.S. citizen in 1873 prior to Hawaii’s annexation. Kiha Ka’awa was born November 15th 1862 in a village at Palawai, Lanai island Maui Hawaii, then moved to Laie located at the Northeastern side of Oahu Hawaii as a young boy to help develop the Mormon presence with George Nebeker and family at the present day site where the Mormon church is and the Polynesian Cultural Center is located. From Laie, Kiha Ka’awa emigrated via ship with Kahana Pukahi, the Nebekers and William King to Salt Lake City Utah. Kiha remained in Utah, married twice, and had several children largely in Salt Lake City Utah area until he passed away on December 26th 1931. Kiha was visited in the US by Hawaiian King David Kalākaua, in Ogden Utah where the King and Kiha spoke for several hours in their native language before the Kings schedule had him back on his US trip, and on a train. Kahana Pukahi returned to the Sandwich Islands in the later part of the 1870’s, and remained a subject of the Kingdom of Hawaii.

<text>V-shaped passage graves are a megalithic chamber tomb found in parts of Atlantic Europe including Ireland, the Channel Islands and Brittany. They date to between 3500 and 2500BC.

They are similar to Wedge-shaped gallery graves in that in plan they have a narrow entrance that widens out inside into a burial chamber. The entrance passage and the burial chamber are distinguished by sill stones, however, meaning they are part of the passage grave tradition. 

In some cases a small sub chamber leads off from the main chamber.

Examples include &quot;La Varde&quot; and Le Creux es Faies on Guernsey and &quot;Le Ruen&quot; and &quot;Ty-ar-Boudiquet&quot; in Brtittany.

<doc id="681752" wikidata="Q1191278" url="?curid=681752" title="Blanquette de veau">
<text>Blanquette de veau () is a French veal stew. In the classic version of the dish the meat is simmered in a white stock and served in a sauce velouté enriched with cream and egg. It is among the most popular meat dishes in France.

==Definition==
&quot;The Oxford Companion to Food&quot; describes &quot;blanquette&quot; as &quot;a French and to some extent international culinary term indicating a dish of white meat (veal, poultry, also lamb) served in a white sauce&quot;. In &quot;Larousse Gastronomique&quot;, Prosper Montagne&#x27;s definition is &quot;the French term for a ragout of white meat (veal, lamb or poultry) cooked in a white stock or water with aromatic flavourings&quot;.

Simone Beck, Louisette Bertholle and Julia Child in their &quot;Mastering the Art of French Cooking&quot; describe blanquette de veau, as &quot;a much-loved stew in France … veal simmered in a lightly seasoned white stock … served in a sauce velouté made from the veal cooking stock and enriched with cream and egg yolks&quot;. In 2007 Anne Willan wrote that French television had recently conducted a poll of favourite meat dishes in which &quot;Blanquette de veau was in the top five, with steak frites and gigot d&#x27;agneau [leg of lamb]&quot;.

==Ingredients==
The name &quot;blanquette&quot; derives from &quot;blanc&quot;, the French word for white, and there is a purist view that the whiteness of the dish is key, and coloured vegetables such as carrots should not be included. In the words of Anthony Bourdain:

Some cooks, such as Anne Willan, share Bourdain&#x27;s view, but numerous cooks from Auguste Escoffier (1907) onwards have included carrots in their recipes for blanquette de veau, though in many cases the carrot is removed prior to serving.

Beck, Bertholle and Child list six suitable cuts of veal for a blanquette: poitrine (breast), haute de côtes (short ribs), épaule (shoulder), côtes découvertes (middle neck) and gîte/jarret (knuckle). Other cooks and food writers have differed in their recommended cuts for the dish:
In older recipes the veal was roast and allowed to go cold before being sliced or chopped, covered in a white sauce and reheated. Eliza Acton&#x27;s 1858 recipe includes mushrooms gently sautéed in butter and served over the veal with &quot;Sauce Tournée&quot; (also called velouté). There was at one time some question of how blanquettes were to be distinguished from fricassées. In 1960 &quot;The Times&quot; commented:
According to Montagne, blanquette de veau is usually served with rice &quot;à la créole&quot; but may also be served with celeriac, halved celery hearts, carrots, braised parsnips or leeks, braised cucumber, braised lettuce or lettuce hearts. Pasta or potatoes are sometimes served instead of rice, and Escoffier recommends noodles.

<doc id="681756" wikidata="Q4780698" url="?curid=681756" title="Apostolic poverty">
<text>Apostolic poverty is a Christian doctrine professed in the thirteenth century by the newly formed religious orders, known as the mendicant orders, in direct response to calls for reform in the Roman Catholic Church. In this, these orders attempted to live their lives without ownership of lands or accumulation of money, following the precepts given to the seventy disciples in the Gospel of Luke (10:1-24), and succeeding to varying degrees. The ascetic Pope Paschal II&#x27;s solution of the Investiture Controversy in his radical Concordat of 1111 with the Emperor, repudiated by the cardinals, was that the ecclesiastics of Germany should surrender to the imperial crown their fiefs and secular offices. Paschal proved to be the last of the Gregorianist popes.

The provocative doctrine was a challenge to the wealth of the church and the concerns about ensuing corruption it brought: rejected by the hierarchy of the Church, it found sympathetic audiences among the disaffected poor of the 12th, 13th, and 14th centuries.

The doctrine of apostolic poverty was condemned as heresy in 1323, but it continued to be a source of debate.

==History==

=== Apostolic Brethren ===
In Northern Italy, Spain, and France primarily, a religious movement of people called the Apostolic Brethren was a large advocate of this idea. The word &quot;Apostolic&quot; used to describe members of the Brethren was also used as a label for people from similar religious sects.

===Humiliati===

One group which was a major proponent of apostolic poverty was the Humiliati, the &quot;Humble Ones&quot;. Founded by a wool merchant, they established communities scattered around Italy and France, organized on the principle of a simple way of life for the laity, who shared their goods while remaining in family units. They remained primarily a lay movement, and came to reject the authority of the hierarchy and the clergy. For this and other reasons, they were later to be declared heretical by the Catholic Church.

It is often assumed that Saint Francis of Assisi was inspired to form the Franciscans by their movement, in an effort to emulate the poverty of Jesus Christ and to bring his message through a simple life and example, while strictly adhering to the beliefs of the Catholic Church. Saint Dominic founded a similar order, the Order of Preachers, better known as the Dominicans.

===Waldenses===

Sometime during the 1170&#x27;s, a wealthy cloth merchant known as Waldes or Peter Waldo experienced a religious conversion, which has been attributed to him hearing a minstrel retell the story of St. Alexis. After hearing this recital, Waldes visited a master theologian in order to determine the surest way to salvation, to which the theologian replied he should follow the scripture; specifically Matthew 19:21: &#x27;If you wish to go the whole way, then go and sell everything you have, and give to the poor&#x27;. Waldes then, after providing for his family, gave away all his possessions and followed a life of apostolic poverty. He had the Gospel translated and began openly preaching, gaining many followers who too embraced lives of apostolic poverty; these men and women became known as the Waldensians. Walter Map, though critical of the Waldensians lack of education and therefore their inability to preach, conceded that they did truly live in a state of poverty comparable to the apostles, describing them as having &#x27;no permanent homes...possessing nothing and having everything in common like the Apostles, naked, following a naked Christ&#x27;. 

===Franciscans===

The Franciscans were authorized by Pope Gregory IX to have non-members who would look after their material needs, while the friars themselves would own nothing and would only make use according to the vow of poverty of what was given to them. From the beginning, two tendencies developed. Some friars, referred to as the Zelanti, living more isolated and simpler lives, strictly observed the poverty enjoined by the testament of Saint Francis. Others lived in convents in the towns, tending the attached churches with the necessary liturgical furnishings and devoting themselves also to study and preaching, which required the use of books. They observed the Franciscan Rule in accordance with interpretations officially made by the Popes. Already Gregory IX had indicated that the testament of St Francis did not oblige the friars in conscience. Pope Innocent IV gave the Franciscans permission to appoint &quot;procurators&quot; to buy, sell and administer goods given to them. Bonaventure, who become minister general in 1257, tried to reconcile the two tendencies and is sometimes called the second founder of the Order, to which he gave its first General Constitutions. Conflicts with the secular clergy and with lay teachers in the universities led to accusations of hypocrisy with regard to the profession of poverty from outsiders, as well as from those members of the order formerly known as the Zelanti, but who then began to be referred to as the Spirituals, because of their association with the Age of the Spirit that the apocalyptic writer Joachim of Fiore had foretold would begin in 1260.

In the early years of the 14th century, the conflict between the Spirituals and the Conventual Franciscans came to a head. The Spirituals, who in the 13th century were led by the Joachimist Peter Olivi, adopted more extreme positions that discredited the notion of apostolic poverty in some eyes and led to condemnation by Pope John XXII.

In his 14 August 1279 bull &quot;Exiit qui seminat&quot;, Pope Nicholas III had confirmed the arrangement already established by Pope Gregory IX, by which all property given to the Franciscans was vested in the Holy See, which granted the friars the mere use of it. The bull declared that renunciation of ownership of all things &quot;both individually but also in common, for God&#x27;s sake, is meritorious and holy; Christ, also, showing the way of perfection, taught it by word and confirmed it by example, and the first founders of the Church militant, as they had drawn it from the fountainhead itself, distributed it through the channels of their teaching and life to those wishing to live perfectly&quot;. Pope Clement V&#x27;s bull &quot;Exivi de Paradiso&quot; of 20 November 1312 failed to effect a compromise between the two factions. Clement V&#x27;s successor, Pope John XXII was determined to suppress what he considered to be the excesses of the Spirituals, who contended eagerly for the view that Christ and his apostles had possessed absolutely nothing, either separately or jointly, and who were citing &quot;Exiit qui seminat&quot; in support of their view. In 1317, he formally condemned the group of them known as the Fraticelli.

On 26 March 1322, John removed the ban on discussion of Nicholas III&#x27;s bull and commissioned experts to examine the idea of poverty based on belief that Christ and the apostles owned nothing. The experts disagreed among themselves, but the majority condemned the idea on the grounds that it would condemn the Church&#x27;s right to have possessions. The Franciscan chapter held in Perugia in May 1322 declared on the contrary: &quot;To say or assert that Christ, in showing the way of perfection, and the Apostles, in following that way and setting an example to others who wished to lead the perfect life, possessed nothing either severally or in common, either by right of ownership and &quot;dominium&quot; or by personal right, we corporately and unanimously declare to be not heretical, but true and catholic.&quot; By the bull &quot;Ad conditorem canonum&quot; of 8 December of the same year, John XXII, declaring that &quot;it was ridiculous to pretend that every egg and piece of bread given to and eaten by the Friars Minor belonged to the pope&quot;, forced them to accept ownership by ending the arrangement according to which all property given to the Franciscans was vested in the Holy See, which granted the friars the mere use of it. He thus demolished the fictitious structure that gave the appearance of absolute poverty to the life of the Franciscan friars, a structure that &quot;absolved the Franciscans from the moral burden of legal ownership, and enabled them to practise apostolic poverty without the inconvenience of actual poverty&quot;. And on 12 November 1323 he issued the short bull &quot;Cum inter nonnullos&quot;, which declared &quot;erroneous and heretical&quot; the doctrine that Christ and his apostles had no possessions whatever.

Influential members of the order protested, including the minister general Michael of Cesena, the English provincial William of Ockham, and Bonagratia of Bergamo. In 1324, Louis the Bavarian sided with the Spirituals and accused the Pope of heresy. In reply to the argument of his opponents that Nicholas III&#x27;s bull &quot;Exiit qui seminat&quot; was fixed and irrevocable, John XXII issued the bull &quot;Quia quorundam&quot; of 10 November 1324, in which he declared that it cannot be inferred from the words of the 1279 bull that Christ and the apostles had nothing, adding: &quot;Indeed, it can be inferred rather that the Gospel life lived by Christ and the Apostles did not exclude some possessions in common, since living &#x27;without property&#x27; does not require that those living thus should have nothing in common.&quot;

In 1328 Michael of Cesena was summoned to Avignon to explain the Order&#x27;s intransigence in refusing the Pope&#x27;s orders and its complicity with Louis of Bavaria. Michael was imprisoned in Avignon, together with Francesco d&#x27;Ascoli, Bonagratia and William of Ockham. In January of that year Louis of Bavaria entered Rome and had himself crowned emperor. Three months later, he declared John XXII deposed and installed the Spiritual Franciscan Pietro Rainalducci as Pope. The Franciscan chapter that opened in Bologna on 28 May reelected Michael of Cesena, who two days before had escaped with his companions from Avignon. But in August Louis the Bavarian and his pope had to flee Rome before an attack by Robert, King of Naples. Only a small part of the Franciscan Order joined the opponents of John XXII, and at a general chapter held in Paris in 1329 the majority of all the houses declared their submission to the Pope. With the bull &quot;Quia vir reprobus&quot; of 16 November 1329, John XXII replied to Michael of Cesena&#x27;s attacks on &quot;Ad conditorem canonum&quot;, &quot;Cum inter&quot; and &quot;Quia quorundam&quot;. In 1330 Antipope Nicholas V submitted, followed later by the ex-general Michael, and finally, just before his death, by Ockham.

<text>Aurolac is an industrial adhesive sold in Romania, designed for use in repairing terracotta stoves, which is commonly abused as an inhalant. The law HG 767/2001 applies restrictions on where and how aurolac, which it uses as a generic term for a variety of substances containing ethers, ketones, acetates, as well as methanol and toluene, can be sold.

In 2000, a child who had abused Aurolac was photographed while naked and crying in a tram station in Bucharest&#x27;s Rahova district. The image was widely published and used to define social problems in Romania. The 2001 documentary &quot;Children Underground&quot; also details the effects of Aurolac abuse amongst Bucharest&#x27;s homeless children.

<text>Saint Dominic, (; 8 August 1170 – 6 August 1221), also known as Dominic de Guzmán (), was a Castilian Catholic priest and the founder of the Dominican Order. He is the patron saint of astronomers and natural scientists, and he and his order are traditionally credited with spreading and popularizing the rosary. He is alternatively called Dominic of Osma, Dominic of Caleruega, and Domingo Félix de Guzmán, and, in Britain and Ireland, Saint Sunday.

==Life==
===Birth and early life===
Dominic was born in Caleruega, halfway between Osma and Aranda de Duero in Old Castile, Spain. He was named after Saint Dominic of Silos. The Benedictine abbey of Santo Domingo de Silos lies a few miles north of Caleruega.

In the earliest narrative source, by Jordan of Saxony, Dominic&#x27;s parents are not named. The story is told that before his birth his barren mother made a pilgrimage to the Abbey at Silos, and dreamt that a dog leapt from her womb carrying a flaming torch in its mouth, and seemed to set the earth on fire. This story is likely to have emerged when his order became known, after his name, as the &quot;Dominican&quot; order, &quot;Dominicanus&quot; in Latin, and a play on words interpreted as &quot;Domini canis&quot;: &quot;Dog of the Lord.&quot; Jordan adds that Dominic was brought up by his parents and a maternal uncle who was an archbishop. The failure to name his parents is not unusual, since Jordan wrote a history of the Order&#x27;s early years, rather than a biography of Dominic. A later source of the 13th century gives their names as Juana and Felix. Nearly a century after Dominic&#x27;s birth, a local author asserted that Dominic&#x27;s father was &quot;vir venerabilis et dives in populo suo&quot; (&quot;an honored and wealthy man in his village&quot;). The travel narrative of Pero Tafur, written circa 1439 (about a pilgrimage to Dominic&#x27;s tomb in Italy), states that Dominic&#x27;s father belonged to the family de Guzmán, and that his mother belonged to the &quot;Aça&quot; or Aza family. Dominic&#x27;s mother, Joan of Aza, was beatified by Pope Leo XII in 1829. His older brother, Manés was also beatified by Pope Gregory XVI on 1834.

===Education and early career===

At fourteen years of age, Dominic was sent to the Premonstratensian monastery of Santa María de La Vid and subsequently transferred for further studies in the schools of Palencia. In Palencia, he devoted six years to the arts and four to theology. At some point in time he also joined Santa María de La Vid.

In 1191, when Spain was desolated by famine, young Dominic gave away his money and sold his clothes, furniture, and even precious manuscripts to feed the hungry. Dominic reportedly told his astonished fellow students, &quot;Would you have me study off these dead skins when men are dying of hunger?&quot;

At the age of 24, Dominic was ordained as a priest and subsequently joined the canonry of the Cathedral of Osma. In 1198, Don Martin de Bazan, the Bishop of Osma, having reformed the chapter, made Dominic the subprior of the chapter.

Diego de Acebo succeeded Bazan as Bishop of Osma in 1201. In 1203 or 1204, Dominic accompanied Diego on a diplomatic mission for Alfonso VIII, King of Castile, to secure a bride in Denmark for crown prince Ferdinand. The envoys traveled to Denmark via Aragon and the south of France. The marriage negotiations ended successfully, but the princess died before leaving for Castile. During their return journey, they met with Cistercian monks who had been sent by Pope Innocent III to preach against the Cathars, a religious sect with gnostic and dualistic beliefs which the Catholic Church deemed heretical. Dominic and Diego de Acebo attributed the Cistercians&#x27; lack of success to their extravagance and pomp compared to the asceticism of the Cathars. Dominic and Diego decided to adopt a more ascetic way of life and began a program in the south of France to convert the Cathars.

===Prouille===

In late 1206, Acebo and his group established themselves at the Monastery of Our Lady of Prouille in France. Bishop Foulques of Toulouse allowed them to use the church. The house was intended partly as a refuge for women who had previously lived in Cathar religious houses, and partly the first established base of operations. The first nuns of Prouille lived for several months at Fanjeaux, because the buildings at Prouille were not yet habitable. Dominic gave them the Rule of St. Augustine.

Catholic-Cathar debates were held at Verfeil, Pamiers and Montréal. Ordered by the Pope to return to his diocese, Diego de Acebo died at Osma in December 1207, leaving Dominic alone in his mission.

====The Vision of Mary and the rosary====
Based on a Dominican tradition, in 1208 Dominic experienced a vision of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the church at Prouille, during which she gave him a rosary. This gave rise to the title Our Lady of the Rosary.

According to Bollandists, the story of the vision was originated with Alanus de Rupe, which is not to be regarded as historical.

The spread of the rosary is attributed to the preaching of the Dominicans. For centuries the rosary has been at the heart of the Dominican Order. Pope Pius XI stated, that the rosary is &quot;the principle and foundation on which the Order of St. Dominic rests for perfecting the lives of its members and obtaining the salvation of others.&quot;

===Foundation of the Dominicans===
In 1215, Dominic established himself, with six followers, in a house given by Peter Seila, a rich resident of Toulouse. Dominic saw the need for a new type of organization to address the spiritual needs of the growing cities of the era, one that would combine dedication and systematic education, with more organizational flexibility than either monastic orders or the secular clergy. He subjected himself and his companions to the monastic rules of prayer and penance; Bishop Foulques gave them written authority to preach throughout the territory of Toulouse.

Also in 1215, the year of the Fourth Lateran Council, Dominic and Foulques went to Rome to secure the approval of Pope Innocent III. Dominic returned to Rome a year later and was finally granted written authority in December 1216 by the new pope, Honorius III, for him to form the &quot;Ordo Praedicatorum&quot; (&quot;Order of Preachers&quot;).

In the winter of 1216–1217, at the house of Ugolino de&#x27; Conti, Dominic first met William of Montferrat, who joined Dominic as a friar in the Order of Preachers and remained a close friend.

===Later life===
Cecilia Cesarini, who was received by Dominic into his new order, in her old age described him as &quot;...thin and of middle height. His face was handsome and somewhat fair. He had reddish hair and beard and beautiful eyes ... His hands were long and fine and his voice pleasingly resonant. He never got bald, though he wore the full tonsure, which was mingled with a few grey hairs.&quot;
Although he traveled extensively to maintain contact with his growing brotherhood of friars, Dominic made his headquarters in Rome. In 1219, Pope Honorius III invited Dominic and his companions to take up residence at the ancient Roman basilica of Santa Sabina, which they did by early 1220. Before that time the friars had only a temporary residence in Rome at the convent of San Sisto Vecchio, which Honorius III had given to Dominic circa 1218, intending it to become a convent for a reformation of nuns at Rome under Dominic&#x27;s guidance. The official foundation of the Dominican convent at Santa Sabina with its &quot;studium conventuale&quot;, the first Dominican &quot;studium&quot; in Rome, occurred with the legal transfer of property from Pope Honorius III to the Order of Preachers on 5 June 1222, though the brethren had taken up residence there already in 1220. The &quot;studium&quot; at Santa Sabina was the forerunner of the &quot;studium generale&quot; at Santa Maria sopra Minerva. The latter would be transformed in the 16th century into the College of Saint Thomas (), and then in the 20th century into the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot; sited at the convent of Saints Dominic and Sixtus.

Dominic arrived in Bologna on 21 December 1218. A convent was established at the Mascarella church by Reginald of Orleans. Soon afterward they had to move to the church of San Nicolò of the Vineyards. Dominic settled in this church and held here the first two General Chapters of the order.

According to Guiraud, Dominic abstained from meat, &quot;observed stated fasts and periods of silence&quot;, &quot;selected the worst accommodations and the meanest clothes&quot;, and &quot;never allowed himself the luxury of a bed&quot;. &quot;When traveling, he beguiled the journey with spiritual instruction and prayers&quot;. Guiraud also states that Dominic frequently traveled barefoot and that &quot;rain and other discomforts elicited from his lips nothing but praises to God&quot;.

Dominic died at the age of fifty-one, according to Guiraud &quot;exhausted with the austerities and labors of his career&quot;. He had reached the convent of St Nicholas at Bologna, Italy, &quot;weary and sick with a fever&quot;. Guiraud states that Dominic &quot;made the monks lay him on some sacking stretched upon the ground&quot; and that &quot;the brief time that remained to him was spent in exhorting his followers to have charity, to guard their humility, and to make their treasure out of poverty&quot;. He died at noon on 6 August 1221. His body was moved to a simple sarcophagus in 1233. Under the authority of Pope Gregory IX, Dominic was canonized in 1234. In 1267 Dominic&#x27;s remains were moved to the shrine, made by Nicola Pisano and his workshop for the Church of St. Dominic in Bologna.

Dominic is commonly but apocryphally associated with the Inquisition. Historical sources from Dominic&#x27;s own time period reveal nothing about his involvement in the Inquisition. Dominic died in 1221, and the office of the Inquisition was not established until 1231 in Lombardy and 1234 in Languedoc.

Canon 27 of the Third Council of the Lateran of 1179 stressed the duty of princes to repress heresy and condemned &quot;the Brabantians, Aragonese, Basques, Navarrese, and others who practice such cruelty toward Christians that they respect neither churches nor monasteries, spare neither widows nor orphans, neither age nor sex, but after the manner of pagans, destroy and lay waste everything&quot;. This was followed in 1184 by a decretal of Pope Lucius III, &quot;Ad abolendam&quot;. This decreed that bishops were to investigate the presence of heresy within their respective dioceses. Practices and procedures of episcopal inquisitions could vary from one diocese to another, depending on the resources available to individual bishops and their relative interest or disinterest. Convinced that Church teaching contained revealed truth, the first recourse of bishops was that of &quot;persuasio&quot;. Through discourse, debates, and preaching, they sought to present a better explanation of Church teaching. This approach often proved very successful.

In 1231 Pope Gregory IX appointed a number of Papal Inquisitors, mostly Dominicans and Franciscans, for the various regions of Europe. As mendicants, they were accustomed to travel. Unlike the haphazard episcopal methods, the papal inquisition was thorough and systematic, keeping detailed records. This tribunal or court functioned in France, Italy and parts of Germany and had virtually ceased operation by the early fourteenth century.

In the 15th century, the Spanish Inquisition commissioned the artist Pedro Berruguete to depict Dominic presiding at an &quot;auto da fé&quot;. Thus, the Spanish inquisitors promoted a historical legend for the sake of auto-justification. Reacting against the Spanish tribunals, 16th- and 17th-century Protestant polemicists gladly developed and perpetuated the legend of Dominic the Inquisitor. This image gave German Protestant critics of the Catholic Church an argument against the Dominican Order whose preaching had proven to be a formidable opponent in the lands of the Reformation. As Edward Peters notes, &quot;In Protestant historiography of the sixteenth century a kind of anti-cult of St. Dominic grew up.&quot;

== Cord of Saint Dominic ==
The Cord (belt) of Saint Dominic is a Catholic sacramental which reminds the wearer of the protection of Saint Dominic. The history of the cord is associated with the miraculous image of Saint Dominic in Soriano, the perimeter of which painting defines the length of the Cord. The beginning of the prayer &quot;O wonderful hope&quot; is written on the Cord. According to the tradition, if someone wishes to receive grace from Saint Dominic, they should wear it all the time. Infertile couples use the Cord to pray for intercession of Saint Dominic for the gift of offspring from God.

==Toponymy==
The country Dominican Republic and its capital Santo Domingo are named after Saint Dominic.

== Veneration ==
The &quot;Arca di San Domenico&quot; is a shrine containing the remains of Saint Dominic, located in the Basilica of San Domenico in Bologna.

The feast of Saint Dominic is celebrated with great pomp and devotion in Malta, in the old city of Birgu and the capital city Valletta. The Dominican order has very strong links with Malta and Pope Pius V, a Dominican friar himself, aided the Knights of St. John to build the city of Valletta.

The Pattern of Urlaur is an annual festival held on 4 August at Urlaur, Kilmovee, County Mayo since medieval times, to commemorate the feast day of Saint Dominic.

* 25 January – commemoration of translation of relics to Church of Saint Roch

<text>Daniel Defert (10 September 1937 – 7 February 2023) was a French sociologist and HIV/AIDS activist. Partner to the late Michel Foucault, Defert co-founded France&#x27;s first AIDS advocacy group, AIDES, following Foucault&#x27;s death from complications related to the disease. Defert was the heir to Foucault&#x27;s estate.

==Early life==
Daniel Defert was born on 10 September 1937. He graduated from the École normale supérieure de Saint-Cloud. He earned the agrégation in philosophy. Defert met Foucault while he was a philosophy student at the University of Clermont-Ferrand in France and their relationship lasted from 1963 until Foucault&#x27;s death in 1984.

==Early academic career==
A professor of sociology, Daniel Defert was assistant (1969–1970), maître-assistant (1971–1985), then maître de conférence (from 1985) at the Centre Universitaire of Vincennes, which became in 1972 Université Paris VIII Vincennes.

== AIDS research and activism ==
After the death of his partner Michel Foucault from complications related to AIDS, Defert founded AIDES, the first AIDS awareness organization in France. The name invokes the French word for &quot;help&quot; as well as the English acronym for the disease (the French acronym is SIDA). Defert served as president of AIDES from 1984 to 1991.

Defert was a member of the scientific committee for human sciences of the International Conference on AIDS (1986–94); member of the World Commission for AIDS (World Health Organization) (1988–93); member of the National Committee for AIDS (1989–98), of the Global AIDS Policy Coalition of Harvard University (1994–1997), and of the French Haut Comité de la Santé Publique (from 1998).

Defert was the author of numerous articles in the domain of ethno-iconography and public health. He was awarded the decoration of &quot;Chevalier de la Légion d’Honneur&quot; and received the Alexander Onassis prize for the creation of AIDES in 1998.

==Foucault estate==
After Foucault&#x27;s death, Defert inherited his estate despite the fact that their partnership preceded French government recognition of gay couples through civil unions (1999) or marriage (2013) and Foucault left no official will; however Foucault had written a letter indicating his intention to bequeath his apartment and all its contents, which included his archive and corrected proofs for an unpublished manuscript, to Defert. Other family members deferred to Foucault&#x27;s wishes, but without government recognition, Defert, like other surviving partners in a similar position, was still subject to much higher inheritance taxes than he would have been as a recognized family member.

Defert co-edited, with François Ewald, volume 4 of &quot;Dits et Ecrits&quot; of Michel Foucault (1994), a posthumous collection of Foucault&#x27;s writing.

In 2013, Defert sold for €3.8m ($4.0m, May 2022) Foucault&#x27;s archives to France&#x27;s national library, making the material available to researchers; subsequently the family, which owns the literary rights, elected to publish the manuscript (&quot;Confessions of the Flesh&quot;, 2018, the fourth and final volume of Foucault&#x27;s &quot;History of Sexuality&quot;), despite Foucault&#x27;s instruction that no work be published posthumously. Defert explained the decision that after the material became available to researchers with the credentials to acquire a reader card at the national library, Defert and others close to Foucault felt that access should be either available &quot;to everyone or no one&quot;. Additionally, many previous posthumous works had already been published, and Defert felt this new addition did not make any encroachment on Foucault&#x27;s intimate life, but strictly contributed to the corpus of his intellectual contributions; by contrast, the letters exchanged between the two of them, Defert said in 2012, he intended to &quot;take to his grave.&quot;

==Death==
Defert died in Paris on 7 February 2023, at the age of 85.

<doc id="681774" wikidata="Q1293233" url="?curid=681774" title="Freewheel">
<text>In mechanical or automotive engineering, a freewheel or overrunning clutch is a device in a transmission that disengages the driveshaft from the driven shaft when the driven shaft rotates faster than the driveshaft. An overdrive is sometimes mistakenly called a freewheel, but is otherwise unrelated.

The condition of a driven shaft spinning faster than its driveshaft exists in most bicycles when the rider stops pedaling. In a fixed-gear bicycle, without a freewheel, the rear wheel drives the pedals around.

An analogous condition exists in an automobile with a manual transmission going downhill, or any situation where the driver takes their foot off the gas pedal, closing the throttle: the wheels drive the engine, possibly at a higher RPM. In a two-stroke engine, this can be catastrophic—as many two stroke engines depend on a fuel/oil mixture for lubrication, a shortage of fuel to the engine starves oil from the cylinders, and the pistons can soon seize, causing extensive damage. Saab used a freewheel system in their two-stroke models for this reason and maintained it in the Saab 96 V4 and early Saab 99 for better fuel efficiency.

==Mechanics==
The simplest freewheel device consists of two saw-toothed, spring-loaded discs pressing against each other axially with the toothed sides together, like a ratchet but with the usual stationary part also rotating. Rotating in one direction, the saw teeth of the drive disc lock with the teeth of the driven disc, making it rotate at the same speed. If the drive disc slows down or stops rotating, the teeth of the driven disc slip over the drive disc teeth and continue rotating, producing a characteristic clicking sound proportionate to the speed difference of the driven gear relative to that of the (slower) driving gear.

A more sophisticated and rugged design has spring-loaded steel rollers inside a driven cylinder. Rotating in one direction, the rollers lock with the cylinder making it rotate in unison. Rotating slower, or in the other direction, the steel rollers just slip inside the cylinder.

Bicycles use freewheels to allow the cyclist to coast without pedaling. Rotating either the wheel or cassette in the direction that produces the clicking sound causes the pawl to easily slide up and over the gently sloped edges of the teeth. This process is sometimes informally referred to as &quot;slipping.&quot; In this scenario, the cassette rotates independently of the rear wheel. When the cyclist stops pedaling, the ratchet slips as the wheel continues to rotate while the cassette stops, producing the clicking noise. Consequently, a bicycle will not move in reverse if the cyclist pedals backwards. When the cassette or wheel is rotated in the opposite direction, the pawl catches against the steeper-sloped edges of the teeth, creating a lock. As the cyclist pedals forward, the cassette spins forward causing the pawl to catch against the steep slope of the teeth and drive the rear wheel in the forward direction. This also explains why pushing the bicycle forward causes the pedals to rotate in the forward direction. 

Most bicycle freewheels use an internally step-toothed drum with two or more spring-loaded, hardened steel pawls to transmit the load. More pawls help spread the wear and give greater reliability although, unless the device is made to tolerances not normally found in bicycle components, simultaneous engagement of more than two pawls is rarely achieved.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
By its nature, a freewheel mechanism acts as an automatic clutch, making it possible to change gears in a manual gearbox, either up- or downshifting, without depressing the clutch pedal, limiting the use of the manual clutch to starting from standstill or stopping. The Saab freewheel can be engaged or disengaged by the driver by respectively pushing or pulling a lever. This locks or unlocks the main shaft with the freewheel hub.

A freewheel also produces slightly better fuel economy on carbureted engines (without fuel turn-off on engine brake) and less wear on the manual clutch, but leads to more wear on the brakes as there is no longer any ability to perform engine braking. This may make freewheel transmissions dangerous for use on trucks and automobiles driven in mountainous regions, as prolonged and continuous application of brakes to limit vehicle speed soon leads to brake-system overheating followed shortly by total failure.

==Uses==

===Agricultural equipment===
In agricultural equipment an overrunning clutch is typically used on hay balers and other equipment with a high inertial load, particularly when used in conjunction with a tractor without a live power take-off (PTO). Without a live PTO, a high inertial load can cause the tractor to continue to move forward even when the foot clutch is depressed, creating an unsafe condition. By disconnecting the load from the PTO under these conditions, the overrunning clutch improves safety. Similarly, many unpowered &#x27;push&#x27; cylinder lawnmowers use a freewheel to drive the blades: these are geared or chain-driven to rotate at high speed and the freewheel prevents their momentum being transferred in the reverse direction through the drive when the machine is halted.

===Engine starters===
A freewheel assembly is also used on engine starters. Starter motors usually need to spin at 3,000 RPM to get the engine to turn over. When the key is held in the start position for any amount of time after the engine has started, the starter can not spin fast enough to keep up with the flywheel. Because of the extreme gear ratio between starter gear and flywheel (about 15 or 20:1) it would spin the starter armature at dangerously high speeds, causing an explosion when the centripetal force acting on the copper coils wound in the armature can no longer resist the outward force acting on them. In starters without the freewheel or overrun clutch or other disengagement device this would be a major problem because, with the flywheel spinning at about 1,000 RPM at idle, the starter, if engaged with the flywheel, would be forced to spin between 15,000 and 20,000 RPM. Once the engine has turned over and is running, the overrun clutch releases the starter from the flywheel and prevents the gears from re-meshing (as in an accidental turning of the ignition key) while the engine is running. A freewheel clutch is now used in many motorcycles with an electric starter motor. It is used on many combustion-engined mowers. It is used as a replacement for the Starter solenoid (or the older Bendix drive) used on most car starters because it reduces the electrical needs of the starting system and gives reduced complexity.

===Vehicle transmissions===
In addition to the automotive uses listed above (i.e. in two-stroke-engine vehicles and early four-stroke Saabs), freewheels were used in some luxury or up-market conventional cars (such as Packard, Rover and Cord) from the 1930s into the 1960s. Some engines of the period also tended to pass oil past the piston rings under conditions with a closed throttle and high engine speed, when the slight vacuum in the combustion chamber combined with high oil pressure and a high degree of splash lubrication from the fast-turning crankshaft would lead to oil getting in the combustion chamber. 

The freewheel meant that the engine returned to its idle speed on the overrun, thus greatly reducing noise from both the engine and gearbox and reducing oil consumption. The mechanism could usually be locked to provide engine braking if needed. A freewheel was also used in the original Land Rover vehicle from 1948 to 1951. The freewheel controlled drive from the gearbox to the front axle, which disengaged on the overrun. This allowed the vehicle to have a permanent 4 wheel drive system by avoiding &#x27;wind-up&#x27; forces in the transmission. This system worked, but produced unpredictable handling, especially in slippery conditions or when towing, and was replaced by a conventional selectable 4WD system.

During the Second World War, the military Volkswagen vehicles produced by KdF (&quot;Kübelwagen&quot;, &quot;Schwimmwagen&quot;) were fitted with a ZF limited-slip differential system composed of two freewheels, which sent the whole of the engine power to the slower-turning of the two wheels.

Other car makers fitted a freewheel between engine and gearbox as a form of automatic clutch. Once the driver released the throttle and the vehicle was on the overrun, the freewheel disengaged and the driver could change gears without using the clutch pedal. This feature appeared mainly on large, luxury cars with heavy clutches and gearboxes without synchromesh, as the freewheel permitted a smoother and quieter change. Citroën combined a freewheel and a centrifugal clutch to make the so-called &#x27;TraffiClutch&#x27;, which let the driver start, stop, and change the lower gears without using the clutch. This was an option on Citroën 2CVs and its derivatives and, as the name implied, was marketed as a benefit for driving in congested urban areas. Similarly, the Saab 93 was available with an optional Saxomat clutch.

A common use of freewheeling mechanisms is in automatic transmissions. For instance traditional, hydraulic General Motors transmissions such as the Turbo-Hydramatic 400 provide freewheeling in all gears lower than the selected gear. E.g., if the gear selector on a three-speed transmission is labelled &#x27;drive&#x27;(3)-&#x27;super&#x27;(2)-&#x27;low&#x27;(1) and the driver has selected &#x27;super&#x27;, the transmission freewheels if first gear is engaged, but not in second or third gears; if in &#x27;drive&#x27; it freewheels in first or second; finally, if in low, it does not freewheel in any gear. This lets the driver select a lower range to provide engine braking at various speeds, for instance when descending a steep hill.

Overdrive units manufactured by Laycock de Normanville used a freewheel to facilitate a smooth gear change between locked mode (1:1) and overdrive mode without use of the conventional clutch pedal. The freewheel would lock the outgoing axle to the outgoing axle in the brief transition period between the conical clutch for locked mode disengaging and the clutch for overdrive mode engaging.

===Bicycles===
Apart from the usual use of a freewheel where there is a single sprocket at the wheel, and the older style of derailleur gears where the freewheel mechanism is included in the gear/sprocket assembly and the system is called a &quot;freewheel&quot;, the newer style in which the freewheel mechanism is in the hub is called a &quot;freehub&quot;.

===Helicopters===
Freewheels are also used in rotorcraft. Just as a bicycle&#x27;s wheels must be able to rotate faster than the pedals, a rotorcraft&#x27;s blades must be able to spin faster than its drive engines. This is especially important in the event of an engine failure where a freewheel in the main transmission lets the main and tail rotor systems continue to spin independent of the drive system. This provides for continued flight control and an autorotation landing.

== History ==

In 1869, William Van Anden of Poughkeepsie, New York (USA) invented the freewheel for the bicycle. His design placed a ratchet device in the hub of the front wheel (the driven wheel on the &quot;velocipede&quot; designs of the time), which allowed the rider to propel himself forward without pedaling constantly. Initially, bicycle enthusiasts rejected the idea of a freewheel because they believed it would complicate the mechanical functions of the bicycle. Bicycle enthusiasts believed that the bicycle was supposed to remain as simple as possible without any additional mechanisms, such as the freewheel.

In the UK, a roller freewheel was patented by J. White and G. Davies of Coventry Machinist Co. in 1881 and fitted to the Chelseymore tricycle, but the pioneers of fitting the freewheel to the safety bicycle were Linley and Biggs Ltd (trading as the Whippet Cycle Syndicate) who fitted a freewheel from the summer of 1894, in part to assist the operation of their 2-speed &#x27;Protean&#x27; gear.

By 1899 there was widespread adoption in UK bicycle manufacture of the freewheel, usually combined with the back-pedal brake, and conversions were offered to existing bicycles.

In 1899 the same system in the USA was known as the “coaster brake”, which let riders brake by pedaling backwards and included the freewheel mechanism. At the turn of the century, bicycle manufacturers within Europe and America included the freewheel mechanism in a majority of their bicycles but now the freewheel was incorporated in the rear sprocket of a bicycle unlike Van Anden’s initial design.

In 1924 French firm Le Cyclo introduced a gear-shifting bicycle with a two sprocket freewheel, which let riders to go uphill with more ease. In the late 1920s, Le Cyclo began using both front and rear derailleurs in combination with a double chainring, giving the bicycle twice as many gears. In the early 1930s, Le Cyclo invented a four sprocket freewheel, and several years later the company combined the four sprocket freewheel with a triple chainring giving the bicycle twelve gears.

In the 1960s and 1970s Japanese manufacturers introduced their own versions of the derailleur. SunTour notably introduced the slant parallelogram rear derailleur design in 1964, which is tilted to keep the pulley closer to each cog of the freewheel as it shifts, providing smoother and better shifting than its European equivalents. This version of the derailleur became the standard when SunTour&#x27;s patent expired in the 1980s, and is still the model for today&#x27;s designs.

<doc id="681780" wikidata="Q285311" url="?curid=681780" title="Dye penetrant inspection">
<text>Dye penetrant inspection (DP), also called liquid penetrate inspection (LPI) or penetrant testing (PT), is a widely applied and low-cost inspection method used to check surface-breaking defects in all non-porous materials (metals, plastics, or ceramics). The penetrant may be applied to all non-ferrous materials and ferrous materials, although for ferrous components magnetic-particle inspection is often used instead for its subsurface detection capability. LPI is used to detect casting, forging and welding surface defects such as hairline cracks, surface porosity, leaks in new products, and fatigue cracks on in-service components.

== History ==
The oil and whiting method used in the railroad industry in the early 1900s was the first recognized use of the principles of penetrants to detect cracks. The oil and whiting method used an oil solvent for cleaning followed by the application of a whiting or chalk coating, which absorbed oil from the cracks revealing their locations. Soon a dye was added to the liquid. By the 1940s, the fluorescent or visible dye was added to the oil used to penetrate test objects.

Experience showed that temperature and soak time was important. This started the practice of written instructions to provide standard, uniform results. The use of written procedures has evolved, giving the ability for design engineers and manufacturers to get the high standard results from any properly trained and certified liquid penetrant testing technician.

== Principles ==
DPI is based upon capillary action, where low surface tension fluid penetrates into clean and dry surface-breaking discontinuities. The penetrant may be applied to the test component by dipping, spraying, or brushing. After adequate penetration time has been allowed, the excess penetrant is removed and a developer is applied. The developer helps to draw penetrant out of the flaw so that an invisible indication becomes visible to the inspector. Inspection is performed under ultraviolet or white light, depending on the type of dye used - fluorescent or nonfluorescent (visible).

== Inspection steps ==
Below are the main steps of Liquid Penetrant Inspection:

1. Pre-cleaning:

The test surface is cleaned to remove any dirt, paint, oil, grease or any loose scale that could either keep penetrant out of a defect or cause irrelevant or false indications. Cleaning methods may include solvents, alkaline cleaning steps, vapour degreasing, or media blasting. The end goal of this step is a clean surface where any defects present are open to the surface, dry, and free of contamination. Note that if media blasting is used, it may &quot;work over&quot; small discontinuities in the part, and an etching bath is recommended as a post-blasting treatment.

2. Application of Penetrant:

The penetrant is then applied to the surface of the item being tested. The penetrant is usually a brilliant coloured mobile fluid with high wetting capability. The penetrant is allowed &quot;dwell time&quot; to soak into any flaws (generally 5 to 30 minutes). The dwell time mainly depends upon the penetrant being used, the material being tested and the size of flaws sought. As expected, smaller flaws require a longer penetration time. Due to their incompatible nature, one must be careful not to apply solvent-based penetrant to a surface which is to be inspected with a water-washable developer.

3. Excess Penetrant Removal:

The excess penetrant is then removed from the surface. The removal method is controlled by the type of penetrant used. Water-washable, solvent-removable, lipophilic post-emulsifiable, or hydrophilic post-emulsifiable are the common choices. Emulsifiers represent the highest sensitivity level, and chemically interact with the oily penetrant to make it removable with a water spray. When using solvent remover and lint-free cloth it is important to not spray the solvent on the test surface directly, because this can remove the penetrant from the flaws. If excess penetrant is not properly removed, once the developer is applied, it may leave a background in the developed area that can mask indications or defects. In addition, this may also produce false indications severely hindering the ability to do a proper inspection. Also, the removal of excessive penetrant is done towards one direction either vertically or horizontally as the case may be.

4. Application of Developer:

After excess penetrant has been removed, a white developer is applied to the sample. Several developer types are available, including: non-aqueous wet developer, dry powder, water-suspendable, and water-soluble. Choice of developer is governed by penetrant compatibility (one can&#x27;t use water-soluble or -suspendable developer with water-washable penetrant), and by inspection conditions. When using non-aqueous wet developer (NAWD) or dry powder, the sample must be dried prior to application, while soluble and suspendable developers are applied with the part still wet from the previous step. NAWD is commercially available in aerosol spray cans, and may employ acetone, isopropyl alcohol, or a propellant that is a combination of the two. Developer should form a semi-transparent, even coating on the surface.

The developer draws penetrant from defects out onto the surface to form a visible indication, commonly known as bleed-out. Any areas that bleed out can indicate the location, orientation and possible types of defects on the surface. Interpreting the results and characterizing defects from the indications found may require some training and/or experience [the indication size is not the actual size of the defect].

5. Inspection:

The inspector will use visible light with adequate intensity (100 foot-candles or 1100 lux is typical) for visible dye penetrant. Ultraviolet (UV-A) radiation of adequate intensity (1,000 micro-watts per centimetre squared is common), along with low ambient light levels (less than 2 foot-candles) for fluorescent penetrant examinations. Inspection of the test surface should take place after 10- to 30-minute development time, and is dependent on the penetrant and developer used. This time delay allows the blotting action to occur. The inspector may observe the sample for indication formation when using visible dye. It is also good practice to observe indications as they form because the characteristics of the bleed out are a significant part of interpretation characterization of flaws.
6. Post Cleaning:

The test surface is often cleaned after inspection and recording of defects, especially if post-inspection coating processes are scheduled.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
The main advantages of DPI are the speed of the test and the low cost. Disadvantages include the detection of only surface flaws, skin irritation, and the inspection should be on a smooth clean surface where excessive penetrant can be removed prior to being developed. Conducting the test on rough surfaces, such as &quot;as-welded&quot; welds, will make it difficult to remove any excessive penetrant and could result in false indications. Water-washable penetrant should be considered here if no other option is available. Also, on certain surfaces, a great enough colour contrast cannot be achieved or the dye will stain the workpiece.

Limited training is required for the operator — although experience is quite valuable. Proper cleaning is necessary to assure that surface contaminants have been removed and any defects present are clean and dry. Some cleaning methods have been shown to be detrimental to test sensitivity, so acid etching to remove metal smearing and re-open the defect may be necessary.

Penetrant inspection can only be applied on non-porous materials

<text>Magnetic particle inspection (MPI) is a nondestructive testing process where a magnetic field is used for detecting surface, and shallow subsurface, discontinuities in ferromagnetic materials. Examples of ferromagnetic materials include iron, nickel, cobalt, and some of their alloys. The process puts a magnetic field into the part. The piece can be magnetized by direct or indirect magnetization. Direct magnetization occurs when the electric current is passed through the test object and a magnetic field is formed in the material. The magnetic lines of force are perpendicular to the direction of the electric current, which may be either alternating current (AC) or some form of direct current (DC) (rectified AC). Indirect magnetization occurs when no electric current is passed through the test object, but a magnetic field is applied from an outside source.

The presence of a surface or subsurface discontinuity in the material allows the magnetic flux to leak, since air cannot support as much magnetic field per unit volume as metals. 

To identify a leak, ferrous particles, either dry or in a wet suspension, are applied to a part. These are attracted to an area of flux leakage and form what is known as an indication, which is evaluated to determine its nature, cause, and course of action, if any.

== Types of electrical currents used ==

There are several types of electrical currents used in magnetic particle inspection. For a proper current to be selected one needs to consider the part geometry, material, the type of discontinuity one is seeking, and how far the magnetic field needs to penetrate into the part. 

*Alternating current (AC) is commonly used to detect surface discontinuities. Using AC to detect subsurface discontinuities is limited due to what is known as the skin effect, where the current runs along the surface of the part. Because the current alternates in polarity at 50 to 60 cycles per second it does not penetrate much past the surface of the test object. This means the magnetic domains will only be aligned equal to the distance AC current penetration into the part. The frequency of the alternating current determines how deep the penetration.
* (FWDC) is used to detect subsurface discontinuities where AC can not penetrate deep enough to magnetize the part at the depth needed. The amount of magnetic penetration depends on the amount of current through the part. DC is also limited on very large cross-sectional parts in terms of how effectively it will magnetize the part.
*Half wave DC (HWDC, pulsating DC) works similar to full wave DC, but allows for detection of surface breaking indications and has more magnetic penetration into the part than FWDC. HWDC is advantageous for inspection process as it actually helps move the magnetic particles during the bathing of the test object. The aid in particle mobility is caused by the half-wave pulsating current waveform. In a typical mag pulse of 0.5 seconds there are 15 pulses of current using HWDC. This gives the particle more of an opportunity to come in contact with areas of magnetic flux leakage. 

An AC electromagnet is the preferred method for find surface breaking indication. The use of an electromagnet to find subsurface indications is difficult. An AC electromagnet is a better means to detect a surface indication than HWDC, DC, or permanent magnet, while some form of DC is better for subsurface defects.

== Equipment ==

A wet horizontal MPI machine is the most commonly used mass-production inspection machine. The machine has a head and tail stock where the part is placed to magnetize it. In between the head and tail stock is typically an induction coil, which is used to change the orientation of the magnetic field by 90° from the head stock. Most of the equipment is built for a specific application.

Mobile power packs are custom-built magnetizing power supplies used in wire wrapping applications.

Magnetic yoke is a hand-held device that induces a magnetic field between two poles. Common applications are for outdoor use, remote locations, and weld inspection. The drawback of magnetic yokes is that they only induce a magnetic field between the poles, so large-scale inspections using the device can be time-consuming. For proper inspection the yoke needs to be rotated 90 degrees for every inspection area to detect horizontal and vertical discontinuities. Subsurface detection using a yoke is limited. These systems used dry magnetic powders, wet powders, or aerosols.

== Demagnetizing parts ==
After the part has been magnetized it needs to be demagnetized. This requires special equipment that works the opposite way of the magnetizing equipment. The magnetization is normally done with a high current pulse that reaches a peak current very quickly and instantaneously turns off leaving the part magnetized. To demagnetize a part, the current or magnetic field needed has to be equal to or greater than the current or magnetic field used to magnetize the part. The current or magnetic field is then slowly reduced to zero, leaving the part demagnetized. A popular method to record residual magnetism is by using a Gauss meter.

*AC demagnetizing
**Pull-through AC demagnetizing coils: seen in the figure to the right are AC powered devices that generate a high magnetic field where the part is slowly pulled through by hand or on a conveyor. The act of pulling the part through and away from the coil&#x27;s magnetic field slows drops the magnetic field in the part. Note that many AC demagnetizing coils have power cycles of several seconds so the part must be passed through the coil and be several feet (meters) away before the demagnetizing cycle finishes or the part will have residual magnetization.
**AC decaying demagnetizing: this is built into most single phase MPI equipment. During the process the part is subjected to an equal or greater AC current, after which the current is reduced over a fixed period of time (typically 18 seconds) until zero output current is reached. As AC is alternating from a positive to a negative polarity this will leave the magnetic domains of the part randomized.
**AC demag does have significant limitations on its ability to demag a part depending on the geometry and the alloys used. 
*Reversing full wave DC demagnetizing: this is a demagnetizing method that must be built into the machine during manufacturing. It is similar to AC decaying except the DC current is stopped at intervals of half a second, during which the current is reduced by a quantity and its direction is reversed. Then current is passed through the part again. The process of stopping, reducing and reversing the current will leave the magnetic domains randomized. This process is continued until zero current is passed through the part. The normal reversing DC demag cycle on modern equipment should be 18 seconds or longer. This method of demag was developed to overcome the limitations presented by the AC demag method where part geometry and certain alloys prevented the AC demag method from working. 
*Halfwave DC demagnetizing (HWDC): this process is identical to full-wave DC demagnetization, except the waveform is half-wave. This method of demagnetization is new to the industry and only available from a single manufacturer. It was developed to be a cost-effective method to demagnetize without needing a full-wave DC bridge design power supply. This method is only found on single-phase AC/HWDC power supplies. HWDC demagnetization is just as effective as full-wave DC, without the extra cost and added complexity. Of course, other limitations apply due to inductive losses when using HWDC waveform on large-diameter parts. Also, HWDC effectiveness is limited past 410 mm (16 in) diameter using a 12-volt power supply.

== Magnetic particle powder ==
A common particle used to detect cracks is iron oxide, for both dry and wet systems.

*Wet system particle range in size from less than 0.5 micrometres to 10 micrometres for use with water or oil carriers. Particles used in wet systems have pigments applied that fluoresce at 365 nm (ultraviolet A) requiring 1000 μW/cm2 (10 W/m2) at the surface of the part for proper inspection. If the particles do not have the correct light applied in a darkroom the particles cannot be detected/seen. It is industry practice to use UV goggles/glasses to filter the UV light and amplify the visible light spectrum (normally green and yellow) created by the fluorescing particles. Green and yellow fluorescence was chosen because the human eye reacts best to these colors.

*Dry particle powders range in size from 5 to 170 micrometres, designed to be seen in white light conditions. The particles are not designed to be used in wet environments. Dry powders are normally applied using hand-operated air powder applicators.
*Aerosol applied particles are similar to wet systems, sold in premixed aerosol cans similar to hair spray.

===Magnetic particle carriers===
It is common industry practice to use specifically designed oil and water-based carriers for magnetic particles. Deodorized kerosene and mineral spirits have not been commonly used in the industry for 40 years. It is dangerous to use kerosene or mineral spirits as a carrier due to the risk of fire.

== Inspection ==
The following are general steps for inspecting on a wet horizontal machine:
#Workpiece is cleaned of oil and other contaminants.
#Necessary calculations done to know the amount of current required to magnetize the workpiece. Refer ASTM E1444/E1444M for formulas.
#The magnetizing pulse is applied for 0.5 seconds, during which the operator washes the workpiece with the particle, stopping before the magnetic pulse is completed. Failure to stop prior to end of the magnetic pulse will wash away indications.
#UV light is applied while the operator looks for indications of defects that are 0 to ±45 degrees from path the current flowed through the workpiece. Indications only appear 45 to 90 degrees of the magnetic field applied. The easiest way to quickly determine the direction of the magnetic field is running is to grasp the workpiece with either hand between the head stocks laying the thumb against the workpiece (do not wrap the thumb around the workpiece) this is called either left or right thumb rule or right hand grip rule. The direction the thumb points reveals the direction current is flowing. The magnetic field will be running 90 degrees from the current path. On complex geometry, like a crankshaft, the operator needs to visualize the changing direction of the current and magnetic field created. The current starts at 0 degrees then 45 degrees to 90 degree back to 45 degrees to 0 then -45 to -90 to -45 to 0 and this is repeated for each crankpin. Thus, it can be time consuming to find indications that are only 45 to 90 degrees from the magnetic field.
#The workpiece is either accepted or rejected, based on pre-defined criteria.
#The workpiece is demagnetized.
#Depending on requirements, the orientation of the magnetic field may need to be changed 90 degrees to inspect for indications that cannot be detected from steps 3 to 5. The most common way to change magnetic field orientation is to use a &quot;coil shot&quot;. In Fig 1 a 36-inch coil can be seen then steps 4, 5, and 6 are repeated.

<text>Lawrence Sullivan &quot;Sul&quot; Ross (September 27, 1838January 3, 1898) was the 19th governor of Texas, a Confederate States Army general during the American Civil War, and the 4th president of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, now called Texas A&amp;M University.

Ross was raised in the Republic of Texas, which was later annexed to the United States. Much of his childhood was spent on the frontier, where his family founded the town of Waco. Ross attended Baylor University (then located in Independence, Texas) and Florence Wesleyan University in Florence, Alabama. On one of his summer breaks, he suffered severe injuries while fighting Comanches. After graduation, Ross joined the Texas Rangers, and in 1860, led Texas Rangers in the Battle of Pease River, where federal troops recaptured Cynthia Ann Parker, who had been captured by the Comanches as a child in 1836.

When Texas seceded from the United States and joined the Confederacy, Ross joined the Confederate States Army. He participated in 135 battles and skirmishes and became one of the youngest Confederate generals. Following the Civil War, Ross briefly served as sheriff of McLennan County before resigning to participate in the 1875 Texas Constitutional Convention. With the exception of a two-year term as a State Senator, Ross spent the next decade focused on his farm and ranch concerns. In 1887, he became the 19th governor of Texas. During his two terms, he oversaw the dedication of the new Texas State Capitol, and resolved the Jaybird-Woodpecker War. 
Despite his popularity, Ross refused to run for a third term as governor. Days after leaving office, he became the fourth president of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas (now Texas A&amp;M University). He is credited with reorganizing the school&#x27;s finances to save it from closure by the state legislature and opening the first classes to women who were daughters of professors. His tenure saw a large expansion in college facilities and the birth of many school traditions. After his death, the Texas Legislature created Sul Ross State University in his honor.

==Early years==
Lawrence Sullivan Ross was born on September 27, 1838, in Benton&#x27;s Post, Iowa Territory. He was the fourth child and second son of Shapley Prince Ross and Catherine Fulkerson. Ross was jointly named for his paternal uncle, Giles O. Sullivan, and his father&#x27;s grandfather and brother, both named Lawrence Ross. The senior Lawrence Ross had been captured by Native Americans as a child, and lived with them from the time he was six years old until he was rescued at 23. His father, Shapley Ross, was a ranger and Indian agent who often skirmished with Native Americans on the frontier. The experiences and stories told to young Sul caused him to grow up with an animosity towards the native tribes. To differentiate Ross from his uncle and great-grandfather, he was called &quot;Little Sul&quot; when he was a child, and later &quot;Sul&quot;.

Shortly after Ross&#x27;s birth, his parents sold their Iowa property and returned to Missouri to escape Iowa&#x27;s cold weather. In 1839, the family moved to Milam County in the Republic of Texas, where they settled in Robertson&#x27;s Colony on the lower Brazos River. Two years later, they joined seven other families under Captain Daniel Monroe and settled near present-day Cameron, where they received 640 acres (260 ha) of land along the Little River. While living in Milam, they became slave owners, enabled by the government grant of land. Their land adjoined Comanche territory and was raided several times.

In 1845, the family moved to Austin so Ross and his older siblings could attend school. Four years later, they relocated again. By this time, Shapley Ross was well known as a frontiersman, and to coax him to settle in the newly formed community of Waco, the family was given four city lots, exclusive rights to operate a ferry across the Brazos, and the right to buy of farmland at US$1 per acre. In March 1849, the Ross family built the first house in Waco, a double-log cabin on a bluff overlooking the springs. Ross&#x27;s sister Kate soon became the first Caucasian child born in Waco.

Eager to further his education, Ross entered the Preparatory Department at Baylor University (then in Independence, Texas) in 1856, despite the fact that he was several years older than most of the other students. He completed the two-year study course in one year. Following his graduation, he enrolled at Florence Wesleyan University in Florence, Alabama. The Wesleyan faculty originally deemed his mathematics knowledge so lacking, they refused his admittance; the decision was rescinded after a professor agreed to tutor Ross privately in the subject. At Wesleyan, students lived with prominent families instead of congregating in dormitories, thus giving them &quot;daily exposure to good manners and refinement&quot;. Ross lived with the family of his tutor.

==Wichita Village fight==
During the summer of 1858, Ross returned to Texas and journeyed to the Brazos Indian Reserve, where his father served as Indian agent. The United States Army had conscripted Indians from the reserve to help the &quot;Wichita Expedition&quot; of 2nd Cavalry in a search for Buffalo Hump, a Penateka Comanche chief who had led several deadly raids on Texas settlements. Fearing that Shapley Ross was too ill to lead them on the expedition, the Indians appointed Sul Ross as commander. With his father&#x27;s approval, the younger Ross led the 135 warriors to accompany 225 troops led by brevet Major Earl Van Dorn. Ross was given the courtesy title of &quot;Captain&quot; during his command.

Native scouts found about 500 Comanches, including Buffalo Hump, camped outside a Wichita village in Indian Territory. Early in the battle, Ross and his men successfully stampeded the Comanche horses, leaving the Comanche warriors at a disadvantage when facing the mounted troops. When many Comanche tried to flee the area, Ross, one of his scouts, Lieutenant Cornelius Van Camp of the 2nd Cavalry, and one of his troopers chased a party of noncombatants that appeared to contain a white child. On Ross&#x27;s orders, his man grabbed the child; as the four turned to rejoin the battle, they were confronted by 25 Comanche warriors. Van Camp and the private were killed with arrows, and Ross received an arrow through his shoulder. A Comanche picked up the trooper&#x27;s carbine and fired a 0.58-caliber bullet through Ross&#x27;s chest. His attacker, Mohee, was a Comanche warrior Ross had known since childhood. Mohee was killed by buckshot fired by Lieutenant James Majors of the 2nd Cavalry as the warrior approached the temporarily paralyzed Ross with a scalping knife.

After five hours of fighting, the troops subdued the Comanche resistance. Buffalo Hump escaped, but 70 Comanches were killed or mortally wounded, two of them noncombatants. Ross&#x27;s injuries were severe, and for five days, he lay under a tree on the battlefield, unable to be moved. His wounds became infected, and Ross begged the others to kill him to end his pain. When he was able to travel, he was first carried on a litter suspended between two mules, and then on the shoulders of his men. He recovered fully, but experienced some pain for much of the rest of the year.

In his written report, Van Dorn praised Ross highly. The &quot;Dallas Herald&quot; printed the report on October 10, and other state newspapers also praised Ross&#x27;s bravery. General Winfield Scott learned of Ross&#x27;s role and offered him a direct commission in the Army. Eager to finish his education, Ross declined Scott&#x27;s offer, and returned to school in Alabama.

The following year, Ross graduated from Wesleyan with a Bachelor of Arts and returned to Texas. Once there, he discovered no one had been able to trace the family of the young Caucasian girl rescued during the Wichita Village fight. He adopted the child and named her Lizzie Ross, in honor of his new fiancée, Elizabeth Dorothy Tinsley.

==Texas Rangers==

===Enlistment===
In early 1860, Ross enlisted in Captain J. M. Smith&#x27;s Waco company of Texas Rangers, which formed to fight the Native Americans. Smith appointed Ross his second lieutenant. When Smith was promoted, the other men in the company unanimously voted to make Ross the new captain. In conjunction with several other Ranger companies, Ross led his men to retaliate against a Kickapoo tribe, who had murdered two white families. The tribe had been warned of the Rangers&#x27;s approach and set the prairie ablaze. The Rangers were forced to abandon their mission when confronted with the massive wildfire.

Smith disbanded Ross&#x27;s company in early September 1860. Within a week, Governor Sam Houston authorized Ross to raise his own company of 60 mounted volunteers to protect the settlements near Belknap from Native American attacks. Ross and his men arrived at Fort Belknap on October 17, 1860, to find the local citizens they were sworn to protect had passed a resolution asking Ross to resign his commission and leave the frontier. The citizens erroneously believed the raiding was committed by Native Americans from the reservations, and they feared Ross&#x27;s friendship with those on the reservations would make him ineffective.

===Battle of Pease River===

In late October and November 1860, Comanches led by Peta Nocona conducted numerous raids on various settlements, culminating in the brutal killing of a pregnant woman. On hearing of these incidents, Houston sent several 25-man companies to assist Ross. A citizen&#x27;s posse had tracked the raiders to their winter village along the Pease River. As the village contained at least 500 warriors and many women and children, the posse returned to the settlements to recruit additional fighters. Ross requested help from the US Army at Camp Cooper, which sent 21 troops.

Immediately after the soldiers arrived on December 11, Ross and 39 Rangers departed for the Comanche village. On December 13, they met the civilian posse, which had grown to 69 members. After several days of travel, the fast pace and poor foraging forced the civilians to stop and rest their horses. All of the US soldiers and 20 of the Rangers continued on. When they neared the village, Charles Goodnight scouted ahead. Hidden from view by a dust storm, he was able to get within of the village and saw signs that the tribe was preparing to move on. Realizing his own horses were too tired for a long pursuit, Ross resolved to attack immediately, before the civilians were able to rejoin the group. Ross led the Rangers down the ridge, while the soldiers circled around to cut off the Comanche retreat. These &quot;aggressive tactics of carrying the war to the Comanche fireside...ended charges of softness in dealing with the Indians.&quot;

Seven men, women, and children were killed and around seven or more escaped. US soldiers came upon a woman who held a child over her head; the men did not shoot, but instead surrounded and stopped her. Ross admitted to a cousin of Cynthia Ann Parker that he played no hand in helping to rescue Cynthia Ann Parker and her daughter, shown in 1861.
The civilian posse arrived at the battleground as the fighting finished. Although they initially congratulated Ross for winning the battle, some of them later complained that Ross had pushed ahead without them so he would not have to share the glory or the spoils of war.

When Cynthia Ann Parker was taken to Ft. Cooper, US command realized the captured woman had blue eyes. The woman could not speak English and did not remember her birth name or details of her life prior to joining the Comanche. After much questioning, she was able to provide a few details of her capture as a child. The details matched what they knew of the 1836 Fort Parker Massacre, and they summoned Colonel Isaac Parker to identify her. Several modern (non-contemporary) sources report that when Parker mentioned his kidnapped niece had been named Cynthia Ann Parker, the woman slapped or pointed at her chest and said &quot;Me Cincee Ann.&quot; Parker never returned to the Comanche people, and &quot;was not particularly grateful&quot; to have been found.
In the aftermath, a nine-year-old Comanche boy found was found hiding alone in the tall grass. Ross took the child with him, naming him Pease. Though Pease was later given the choice to return to his people, he repeatedly declined and was raised by Ross.

However, some take issue with this narrative of events. After Ross&#x27;s death, Nocona&#x27;s son Quanah Parker maintained his father was not present at the battle, and instead died three or four years later. She identified the man Martinez shot as a Mexican captive, the personal servant of Nocona&#x27;s wife, Cynthia Ann Parker. In &quot;Myth, Memory and Massacre: The Pease River Capture of Cynthia Ann Parker&quot; the authors contend most of the material in the 1886 book of James T. Deshields was falsified or exaggerated for political gain. They also offer primary documentation that Peta Nocona was not at the scene, but rather died around 1865, not in December 1860, and that only 15 Comanches were in the camp. Its authors found nine primary accounts of the incident given by Ross, each of them differing from the others.

===Resignation===
When Ross returned home, Houston asked him to disband the company and form a new company of 83 men, promising to send written directives soon. While Ross was in the process of supervising this reorganization, Houston appointed Captain William C. Dalrymple as his new &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; with overall command of the Texas Rangers. Dalrymple, unaware of Houston&#x27;s verbal orders, castigated Ross for disbanding his company. Ross completed the reorganization of the company, then returned to Waco and resigned his commission. In his letter of resignation, effective February 1861, Ross informed Houston of his encounter with Dalrymple, and noted he did not believe a Ranger company could be effective if the captain did not report solely to the governor. Houston offered to appoint Ross as an &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; with the rank of colonel, but Ross refused.

==Civil War service==

===Enlistment/Commissioned Officer===

In early 1861 after Texas voted to secede from the United States and join the Confederacy, Ross&#x27;s brother Peter began recruiting men for a new military company. Ross enlisted in his brother&#x27;s company as a private, and shortly afterwards, Governor Edward Clark requested he instead proceed immediately to the Indian Territory to negotiate treaties with the Five Civilized Tribes, so they would not help the Union Army. One week after his May 28 wedding to Lizzie Tinsley, Ross set out for the Indian Territory. Upon reaching the Washita Agency, he discovered the Confederate commissioners had already signed a preliminary treaty with the tribes.

Ross returned home for several months. In the middle of August, he departed, with his company, for Missouri, leaving his wife with her parents. On September 7, his group became Company G of Stone&#x27;s Regiment, later known as the Sixth Texas Cavalry. The other men elected Ross as the major for the regiment. Twice in November 1861, Ross was chosen by General McCulloch, with whom he had served in the Texas Rangers, to lead a scouting force near Springfield, Missouri. Both times, Ross successfully slipped behind the Union Army lines, gathered information, and retreated before being caught. After completing the missions, he was granted a 60-day leave and returned home to visit his wife.

In early 1862, Ross returned to duty. By late February, 500 troops and he were assigned to raid the Union Army. He led the group behind the enemy lines, to Keetsville (now Washburn), Missouri, where they gathered intelligence, destroyed several wagonloads of commissary supplies, captured 60 horses and mules, and took 11 prisoners. The following month, the regiment was assigned to Earl Van Dorn, now a major general, with whom Ross had served during the battle at the Wichita Village. Under Van Dorn, the group suffered a defeat at the Battle of Pea Ridge; Ross attributed their loss solely to Van Dorn, and blamed him for overmarching and underfeeding his troops, and for failing to properly coordinate the plan of attack. In April, the group was sent to Des Arc, Arkansas. Because of the scarcity of forage, Ross&#x27;s cavalry troop was ordered to dismount and send their horses back to Texas. The unit, now on foot, traveled to Memphis, Tennessee, arriving two weeks after the Battle of Shiloh. Ross soon caught a bad cold accompanied by a lingering fever, and was extremely ill for eight weeks. By the time he considered himself cured, his weight had dwindled to only 125 lb (57 kg).

Over Ross&#x27;s protests, the men of the Sixth Regiment elected him colonel in 1862. He did not want the responsibility of the position and had not wanted to embarrass a friend who wanted the job. Their brigade commander, General Charles W. Phifer, was often absent, leaving Ross in charge. Ross&#x27;s actions impressed other officers, and several times during the summer of 1862, he was nominated for promotion to brigadier general. Although he was not promoted at that time, his unit was the only one of the 8–10 dismounted cavalry units in the area to be promised the return of their horses.

While still afoot, Ross and his men participated in the Battle of Corinth. Under Ross&#x27;s command, his Texans twice captured Union guns at Battery Robinett. They were forced to retreat from their position each time as reinforcements failed to arrive. During the battle, Ross, who had acquired a horse, was bucked off, leading his men to believe he had been killed. He was actually unharmed. The Confederate Army retreated from the battle and found themselves facing more Union troops at Hatchie&#x27;s Bridge. Ross led 700 riflemen to engage the Union troops. For three hours, his men held off 7,000 Union troops, repelling three major Union attacks.

The Sixth Cavalry&#x27;s horses arrived soon after the battle, and the regiment was transferred to the cavalry brigade of Colonel William H. &quot;Red&quot; Jackson. Ross was permitted to take a few weeks leave in November 1862 to visit his wife, and returned to his regiment in mid-January 1863. Several months later, his unit participated in the Battle of Thompson&#x27;s Station. In July, Major General Stephen D. Lee created a new brigade with Ross at the helm, consisting of Ross&#x27;s regiment and Colonel Richard A. Pinson&#x27;s First Mississippi Cavalry. Near the same time, Ross received word that his first child had died, possibly stillborn.

Ross fell ill again in September 1863. From September 27 through March 1864, he suffered recurring attacks of fever and chills every three days, symptomatic of tertiary malaria. Despite his illness, Ross never missed a day of duty, and on December 21, 1863, he was promoted to brigadier general, becoming the ninth-youngest general officer of the Confederate Army. Following his promotion, unit morale improved, and every one of his men re-enlisted.

In March 1864, Ross&#x27;s brigade fought against African American soldiers for the first time in the Battle of Yazoo City. After bitter fighting, the Confederates were victorious. During the surrender negotiations, the Union officer accused the Texans of murdering several captured African American soldiers. Ross claimed two of his men had likewise been killed after surrendering to Union troops.

Beginning in May, the brigade endured 112 consecutive days of skirmishes, comprising 86 separate clashes with the Union forces. Though most of the skirmishes were small, by the end of the period, injuries and desertion had cut the regiment&#x27;s strength by 25%. Ross was captured in late July at the Battle of Brown&#x27;s Mill, but was quickly rescued by a successful Confederate cavalry counterattack.

Their last major military campaign was the Franklin-Nashville Campaign of November and December 1864. Ross and his men led the Confederate advance into Tennessee. Between the beginning of November and December 27, his men captured 550 prisoners, several hundred horses, and enough overcoats and blankets to survive the winter chill. Only 12 of Ross&#x27;s men were killed, with 70 wounded and five captured.

===Surrender===
By the time Ross began a 90-day furlough on March 13, 1865, he had participated in 135 engagements with Union troops and his horse had been shot out from under him five times, yet he had escaped serious injury. With his leave approved, Ross hurried home to Texas to visit the wife he had not seen in two years. While at home, the Confederate Army began its surrender. He had not rejoined his regiment when it surrendered in Jackson, Mississippi, on May 14, 1865. Because he was not present at the surrender, Ross did not receive a parole protecting him from arrest. As a Confederate Army officer over the rank of colonel, Ross was also exempted from President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s amnesty proclamation of May 29, 1865. To prevent his arrest and the confiscation of his property, on August 4, 1865, Ross applied for a special pardon. President Johnson personally approved Ross&#x27;s application on October 22, 1866, but Ross did not receive and formally accept the pardon until July 1867.

==Farming and early public service==
When the Civil War ended, Ross was just 26 years old. He owned of farmland along the South Bosque River west of Waco, and in town. For the first time, his wife and he were able to establish their own home. They expanded their family, having eight children over the next 17 years.

Despite his federal pardon for being a Confederate general, Ross was disqualified from voting and serving as a juror by the first Reconstruction Act of March 2, 1867. This act, and the Supplementary Reconstruction Act passed three weeks later, disenfranchised anyone who had held a federal or state office before supporting the Confederacy.

Reconstruction did not harm Ross&#x27;s fortune, and with hard work, he soon prospered. Shortly after the war ended, he bought of land in town from his parents for $1,500. By May 1869, he had purchased an additional of farmland for $400, and the following year, his wife inherited of farmland from the estate of her father. Ross continued to buy land, and by the end of 1875, he owned over of farmland. Besides farming, Ross and his brother Peter also raised Shorthorn cattle. The two led several trail drives to New Orleans. The combined farming and ranching incomes left Ross wealthy enough to build a house in the Waco city limits and to send his children to private school.

By 1873, Reconstruction in Texas was coming to an end. In December, Ross was elected sheriff of McLennan County, &quot;without campaigning or other solicitation&quot;. Ross promptly named his brother Peter a deputy, and within two years, they had arrested over 700 outlaws. In 1874, Ross helped establish the Sheriff&#x27;s Association of Texas. After various state newspapers publicized the event, sheriffs representing 65 Texas counties met in Corsicana in August 1874. Ross became one of a committee of three assigned to draft resolutions for the convention. They asked for greater pay for sheriffs in certain circumstances, condemned the spirit of mob law, and proposed that state law be modified so arresting officers could use force if necessary to &quot;compel the criminal to obey the mandates of the law.&quot;

Ross resigned as sheriff in 1875 and was soon elected as a delegate to the 1875 Texas Constitutional Convention. One of three members appointed to wait upon convention president-elect E.B. Pickett, Ross was also named to a committee that would determine what officers and employees were needed by the convention. He sat on many other committees, including Revenue and Taxation, the Select Committee on Frontier Affairs, the Select Committee on Education, and the Standing Committee on the Legislative Department. Of the 68 days of the convention, Ross attended 63, voted 343 times, and missed or abstained from voting only 66 times.

When the convention concluded, Ross returned home and spent the next four years focusing on his farm. In 1880, he became an accidental candidate for the Texas Senate from the 22nd District. The nominating convention deadlocked between two candidates, with neither receiving a two-thirds majority. As a compromise, one of the delegates suggested the group nominate Ross. Although no one asked Ross whether he wanted to run for office, the delegates elected him as their candidate. He agreed to the nomination to spare the trouble and expense of another convention.

Ross won the election with a large majority. His term as a Texas Senator began on January 11, 1881. Shortly after his arrival in Austin, his youngest son died. Ross returned home for a week to attend the funeral and help care for another son who was seriously ill In the 17th Texas Legislature, he was a member of the Senate Committees on Agricultural Affairs, Contingent Expenses, Educational Affairs, Enrolled Bills, Finance, Internal Improvements, Penitentiaries, Senatorial and Representative Districts, Apportionment, State Affairs, Statistics of Industries, Public Health, and History of Texas, Stock and Stock Raising, and was the chair of the Committee on Military Affairs. Ross introduced a petition on behalf of 500 citizens of McLennan County, requesting a prohibition amendment to be placed on the next statewide ballot; the legislature did agree to place this on the next ballot.

Although the Texas Legislature typically meets once every two years, a fire destroyed the state capitol building in November 1881, and Ross was called to serve in a special session in April 1882. The session agreed to build a new capitol building. Near the end of the special session, the Senate passed a reapportionment bill, which reduced Ross&#x27;s four-year term to only two years. He declined to run again.

==Governor==

===Election===
As early as 1884, Ross&#x27;s friends, including Victor M. Rose, the editor of the newspaper in Victoria, had encouraged Ross to run for governor. He declined and asked his friend George Clark to attend the 1884 state Democratic convention to prevent Ross from being named the gubernatorial candidate. Clark had to produce written authorization from Ross to convince the delegates to nominate someone else. Ross changed his mind in late 1885, announcing his candidacy for governor on February 25, 1886. During the campaign, he was variously accused of pandering to the Greenbackers, the Republicans, and the Knights. Ross spent no money on his campaign other than traveling expenses, but still handily won the Democratic nomination. He won the general election with 228,776 votes, compared with 65,236 for the Republican candidate and 19,186 from the Prohibitionist candidate. Much of his support came from Confederate veterans.

Ross became the 19th governor of Texas. His inauguration ball was held at the newly opened Driskill Hotel, a tradition followed by every subsequent Texas governor. Under the 1876 Texas Constitution, which he had helped write, the governor was granted the power to be commander-in-chief, to convene the legislature, to act as executor of the laws, to direct trade with other states, to grant pardons, and to veto bills. His campaign had focused on land-use reform, as most of the frontier issues now resulted from disagreements over the use of public land, especially between farmers and ranchers concerned with water rights and grazing issues. At Ross&#x27;s urging, the legislature passed laws to restore the power of the land office commissioner, provide punishments for those using state lands illegally, and to catalog existing public lands.

===Second term===

In May 1888, Ross presided over the dedication of the new Texas State Capitol building. Later that year, Ross ran relatively unopposed for a second term. His platform included abolishing the national banking system, regulating monopolies, reducing tariffs, and allowing the railroads to regulate themselves through competition. No other Democrats placed their names in contention at the nominating convention, and the Republicans chose not to select a candidate, as they were happy with Ross&#x27;s performance. His sole competition was a Prohibitionist whom Ross defeated by over 151,000 votes. In his second inaugural address, Ross, a true Jeffersonian Democrat, maintained, &quot;a plain, simple government, with severe limitations upon delegated powers, honestly and frugally administered, as the noblest and truest outgrowth of the wisdom taught by its founders.&quot;

During his second term, Ross was forced to intervene in the Jaybird-Woodpecker War in Fort Bend County. Sheriff Jim Garvey feared armed battles would occur between the white-supremacist Democrats (the Jaybirds) and the black men who had retained political power (who, with their white supporters, were known as Woodpeckers). At Garvey&#x27;s request, Ross sent two militia companies, which managed to impose a four-month peace. In August 1889, Ross sent four Texas Rangers, including Sergeant Ira Aten, to quell the unrest. Violence erupted, leaving four people dead and injuring six, including a Ranger. Aten wired Ross for help. The following morning, the Houston Light Guard arrived and instituted martial law; that evening, Ross arrived with an assistant attorney general and another militia company. Ross fired all the local civil officials and called together representatives from both factions. On his suggestion, the two groups agreed to choose a mutually acceptable sheriff to replace Garvey, who had been killed in the firefight. When they could not agree on a candidate, Ross suggested Aten; both groups finally agreed, thus halting the conflict.

In March 1890, the U.S. attorney general launched a suit in the Supreme Court against Texas to determine ownership of a disputed plot of land in Greer County. Determined to meet personally with the attorney general, Ross and his wife traveled to Washington, DC, where they visited President Benjamin Harrison at the White House. Following that visit, they traveled to New York City, where they met with former president Grover Cleveland. While in New York, Ross was extremely popular with journalists. He was interviewed by several large northeastern newspapers, which recounted in detail many of his exploits along the frontier. According to his biographer Judith Brenner, the trip and the resulting exposure for Ross, &quot;excited much interest in Texas among easterners, an interest that would eventually bear fruit in increased investment, tourism, and immigration&quot;.

Ross declined to become the first Texas governor to run for a third term, and left office on January 20, 1891. During his four years in office, he vetoed only 10 bills, and issued 861 pardons.

===Major legislation===
During his time in office, Ross proposed tax reform laws intended to provide for more equitable assessments of property; at that time, people were allowed to assess their own belongings with little oversight. The legislature passed his recommendations, and approved his plan to exert more control over school funds and to require local taxation to support the public schools. He also encouraged the legislature to enact antitrust laws. These were passed March 30, 1889, a full year before the federal government enacted the Sherman Antitrust Act. His reform acts were beneficial for the state, leading Ross to become the only Texas governor to call a special session of the legislature to deal with a treasury surplus.

During his term, the legislature agreed to allow the public to vote on a state constitutional amendment for the prohibition of alcohol. Ross vehemently opposed the measure, saying, &quot;No government ever succeeded in changing the moral convictions of its subjects by force.&quot; The amendment was defeated by over 90,000 votes.

When Ross took the governor&#x27;s oath of office, Texas had only four state-owned charitable institutions—two insane asylums, an institute for the blind, and an institute for the deaf and dumb. By the time he left office, Ross had supervised the opening of a state orphan&#x27;s home, a state institute for deaf, dumb, and blind black children, and a branch asylum for the insane. He also convinced the legislature to set aside near Gatesville for a future open farm reformatory for juvenile offenders.

Ross was the first governor to set aside a day for civic improvements, declaring the third Friday in January to be Arbor Day, when schoolchildren should endeavor to plant trees. He also supported the legislature&#x27;s efforts to purchase the Huddle portrait gallery, a collection of paintings of each governor of Texas. These paintings continue to hang in the rotunda of the Texas State Capitol.

Ross felt strongly that the state should adequately care for its veterans. During his first term, the first Confederate home in Texas was dedicated in Austin. Within two years, the facility had run out of room, so Ross served as chairman of a committee to finance a relocation to a larger facility. By August 1890, the home had collected enough money to move to a larger location.

===Arrival===
By the late 1880s, rumors abounded of &quot;poor management, student discontent, professorial dissatisfaction, faculty factionalism, disciplinary problems, and campus scandals&quot; at the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas (now Texas A&amp;M University). The public was skeptical of the idea of scientific agriculture and the legislature declined to appropriate money for improvements to the campus because it had little confidence in the school&#x27;s administrators. The board of directors decided the school, known as Texas AMC, needed to be run by an independent administrative chief rather than the faculty chairman. On July 1, 1890, the board unanimously agreed to offer the new job to the sitting governor and asked Ross to resign his office immediately. Ross agreed to consider the offer, as well as several others he had received. An unknown person informed several newspapers that Ross had been asked to become Texas AMC&#x27;s president, and each of the newspapers editorialized that Ross would be a perfect fit. The college had been founded to teach military and agricultural knowledge, and Ross had demonstrated excellence in the army and as a farmer. His gubernatorial service had honed his administrative skills, and he had always expressed an interest in education.

Though Ross was concerned about the appearance of a conflict of interest, as he had appointed many of the board members who had elected him, he announced he would accept the position. As the news of his acceptance spread throughout the state, prospective students flocked to Texas AMC. Many of the men Ross had supervised during the Civil War wanted their sons to study under their former commander, and 500 students attempted to enroll at the beginning of the 1890–1891 school year. Although the facilities were only designed for 250 scholars, 316 students were admitted. When Ross officially took charge of the school on February 2, the campus had no running water, faced a housing shortage, was taught by disgruntled faculty, and many students were running wild.

===Improvements===

The board of directors named Ross the treasurer of the school, and he posted a $20,000 personal bond &quot;for the faithful performance of his duty&quot;. In the break between school years, Ross instituted a number of changes. When students returned for the 1891–1892 school year, they found a new three-story dormitory with 41 rooms (named Ross Hall), the beginning of construction on a new home for the president, and a new building to house the machine and blacksmith shops. The minimum age for enrollment decreased from 16 to 15, and Ross now personally interviewed all prospective students to determine if they should be admitted. Fees and expenses rose by $10 per session, and the number of hours required for graduation increased, including additional hours in English grammar, sciences, mathematics, and history. Additionally, Ross would now appoint the officers for the Corps of Cadets, and the name of the company of best-drilled cadets in the Corps would change to the Ross Volunteers (from Scott Volunteers). Finally, Ross enacted an official prohibition against hazing, vowing to expel any student found guilty of the practice. Although Ross professed to enjoy his new position, he wrote to several people that directing the college &quot;made me turn gray very fast.&quot;

Enrollment continued to rise, and by the end of his tenure, Ross requested that parents first communicate with his office before sending their sons to the school. The increase in students necessitated an improvement in facilities, and from late 1891 until September 1898, the college spent over $97,000 on improvements and new buildings. This included construction of a mess hall, which could seat 500 diners at once, an infirmary, which included the first indoor toilets on campus, an artesian well, a natatorium, four faculty residences, an electric light plant, an ice works, a laundry, a cold storage room, a slaughterhouse, a gymnasium, a warehouse, and an artillery shed. Despite the expenditures on facilities, the school treasury held a surplus in 1893 and 1894. The 1894 financial report credited the surplus to Ross&#x27;s leadership, and Ross ensured the money was returned to the students in the form of lower fees.

===Impact on students===
Ross made himself accessible to students and participated in school activities whenever possible. Those around him found him &quot;slow to condemn but ready to encourage ... [and they] could not recall hearing Ross use profanity or seeing him visibly angry.&quot; Every month, he prepared grade sheets for each student and would often call poorly performing students into his office for a discussion of their difficulties. Under his leadership, the military aspect of the college was emphasized. However, he eliminated many practices he considered unnecessary, including marching to and from class, and he reduced the amount of guard time and the number of drills the students were expected to perform.

Although enrollment had always been limited to men, Ross favored coeducation, as he thought the male cadets &quot;would be improved by the elevating influence of the good girls&quot;. In 1893, Ethel Hudson, the daughter of a Texas AMC professor, became the first woman to attend classes at the school and helped edit the annual yearbook. She was made an honorary member of the class of 1895. Several years later, her twin sisters became honorary members of the class of 1903, and slowly other daughters of professors were allowed to attend classes.

During Ross&#x27;s tenure, many enduring Texas A&amp;M traditions formed. These include the first Aggie Ring and the formation of the Aggie Band. Ross&#x27;s tenure also had the school&#x27;s first intercollegiate football game, played against the University of Texas. Many student organizations were founded in this time, including the Fat Man&#x27;s Club, the Bowlegged Men&#x27;s Club, the Glee Club (now known as the Singing Cadets), the Bicycle Club, and the College Dramatic Club. In 1893, students began publishing a monthly newspaper, &quot;The Battalion&quot;, and two years later, they began publishing an annual yearbook, known as &quot;The Olio&quot;.

===Personal life and death===
Ross was a Freemason and became a master mason at Waco Masonic Lodge #92. In 1947, a masonic lodge was named after him.

Ross continued to be active in veteran&#x27;s organizations, and in 1893, he became the first commander of the Texas Division of the United Confederate Veterans. He was re-elected president several times and served one term as commander-in-chief of the entire United Confederate Veterans organization. During that time, a Daughters of the Confederacy chapter established in Bryan was named the L.S. Ross Chapter.

In 1894, Ross was appointed to a seat on the Railroad Commission of Texas. While he pondered whether to resign his position and accept the appointment, letters and petitions poured into his office begging him to remain at Texas AMC. He declined the appointment and remained president of the college.

Ross had always been an avid hunter, and he embarked on a hunting trip along the Navasota River with his son Neville and several family friends during Christmas vacation in 1897. While hunting, he suffered acute indigestion and a severe chill and decided to go home early while the others continued their sport. He arrived in College Station on December 30 and consulted a doctor. Ross remained in pain for several days, and in the early evening of January 3, 1898, he died at his home, aged 59 years and 3 months. Although no death certificate was filed, &quot;evidence points to a coronary heart attack as the probable cause of death.&quot; The entire Texas AMC student body accompanied Ross&#x27;s body back to Waco, where Confederate veterans in gray uniforms formed an honor guard. Several thousand people attended Ross&#x27;s burial at Oakwood Cemetery. To further memorialize him, students at Texas AMC held the first Silver Taps ceremony, a tradition still followed when a current student at Texas A&amp;M dies. Following his death, Roger Haddock Whitlock was appointed acting president of the college. Later in July, Lafayette L. Foster, who Ross had appointed as the Commissioner of Agriculture, Insurance, Statistics, and History while governor, became the next president of the college.
==Legacy==
The morning after Ross&#x27;s death, the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; published an editorial, quoted in several biographies of Ross:

It has been the lot of few men to be of such great service to Texas as Sul Ross. ... Throughout his life he has been closely connected with the public welfare and ... discharged every duty imposed upon him with diligence, ability, honesty and patriotism. ... He was not a brilliant chieftain in the field, nor was he masterful in the art of politics, but, better than either, he was a well-balanced, well-rounded man from whatever standpoint one might estimate him. In his public relations he exhibited sterling common sense, lofty patriotism, inflexible honesty and withal a character so exalted that he commanded at all times not only the confidence but the affection of the people. ... He leaves a name that will be honored as long as chivalry, devotion to duty and spotless integrity are standards of our civilization and an example which ought to be an inspiration to all young men of Texas who aspire to careers of public usefulness and honorable renown.
Within weeks of Ross&#x27;s death, former cadets at Texas AMC began gathering funds for a monument. In 1917, the state appropriated $10,000 for the monument, and two years later, a 10-ft (3 m) bronze statue of Ross, sculpted by Pompeo Coppini, was unveiled at the center of the Texas AMC campus. In more recent years, students began the tradition of placing pennies at the feet of statue before exams for good luck. School legend states that Ross would often tutor students, and as payment would accept only a penny for their thoughts. At exam time, his statue, located in Academic Plaza, is often covered in pennies.

At the same time they appropriated money for the statue, the legislature established the Sul Ross Normal College, now Sul Ross State University in Alpine, Texas. The college opened for classes in June 1920.

<doc id="681786" wikidata="Q2398241" url="?curid=681786" title="Bad Hair Day">
<text>Bad Hair Day is the ninth studio album by the American parody musician &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, released on March 12, 1996. It was Yankovic&#x27;s last studio album for the Scotti Brothers label before it was purchased by Volcano Entertainment in 1999. The album produced an array of hit comedy singles; lead single &quot;Amish Paradise&quot;, which lampoons both Coolio&#x27;s &quot;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&quot; and the Amish lifestyle, charted at No. 53 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while &quot;Gump&quot;, which parodies &quot;Lump&quot; by the Presidents of the United States of America and the movie &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, reached at No. 102.

The musical styles on the album are built around parodies and pastiches of pop and rock music of the mid-1990s, largely targeting alternative rock and hip-hop alike. The album also includes style parodies, imitations of specific artists like They Might Be Giants and Elvis Costello. &quot;Amish Paradise&quot; caused a minor controversy after rapper Coolio expressed distaste at having his song parodied by Yankovic, although the two later made amends.

&quot;Bad Hair Day&quot; was met with mixed to positive reviews, with many critics praising &quot;Amish Paradise&quot; in particular; &quot;Amish Paradise&quot; went on to become one of Yankovic&#x27;s best-known singles. The album peaked at No. 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Bad Hair Day&quot; sold 1,317,000 copies in the U.S. in 1996 alone, the highest sales tally for any comedy album in a single calendar year since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991. &quot;Bad Hair Day&quot; was Yankovic&#x27;s sixth Gold record in the United States, and went on to be certified Double Platinum for sales of over two million copies in the U.S. by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album was also certified Platinum in Canada by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA).

==Production==
===Recording===
In November 1994, Yankovic entered Santa Monica Sound Recorders in Santa Monica, California, to begin the first of the &quot;Bad Hair Day&quot; sessions, which he produced himself. Recording with Yankovic were Jon &quot;Bermuda&quot; Schwartz on drums, Steve Jay on bass, and Jim West on guitar. The album was recorded in five sessions. The first session started on November 30 and yielded two originals: &quot;Callin&#x27; In Sick&quot; and &quot;Everything You Know Is Wrong&quot;. The second session started the next day and produced the original songs: &quot;I Remember Larry&quot;, &quot;The Night Santa Went Crazy&quot;, and &quot;Since You&#x27;ve Been Gone&quot;. The third session took place on November 5, 1995, and resulted in the original &quot;I&#x27;m So Sick of You&quot; and the parody &quot;Cavity Search&quot;. The fourth session yielded &quot;The Alternative Polka&quot; medley, and the two parodies &quot;Gump&quot; and &quot;Phony Calls&quot;. The fifth and final recording session produced &quot;Amish Paradise&quot; and &quot;Syndicated Inc.&quot;, both of which were parodies.

===Originals===
&quot;Callin&#x27; In Sick&quot; is a style parody of music popular in Seattle, Washington, most notably grunge. &quot;Everything You Know Is Wrong&quot; is a stylistic pastiche of They Might Be Giants. Yankovic explained that he &quot;tried to write a song sort of in their style, but perhaps even a little bit more twisted&quot;. For fans of They Might Be Giants, he put &quot;little references in here and there, little allusions to other songs of theirs&quot;. The song title is taken from the 1974 Firesign Theatre album of the same name.

&quot;I Remember Larry&quot; is a style parody of Hilly Michaels, and it tells the tale of a neighborhood bully who, after myriad pranks, drives the narrator to kidnap him and leave him for dead in the forest. At the 3:10 mark, the song contains a backmasked message, which when reversed reads, &quot;Wow, you must have an awful lot of free time on your hands&quot;. &quot;The Night Santa Went Crazy&quot; tells the story of Santa snapping, embarking on a killing spree, and eventually being arrested. Originally, the song had a different third verse, differing in the fact that, at the end of the song, Santa is killed by the SWAT team. The &quot;Extra Gory&quot; version was eventually released on the single for &quot;Amish Paradise&quot;. Another version was written for the Touring with Scissors tour in 1999, combining elements of the album version and the &quot;Extra Gory&quot; version. &quot;Since You&#x27;ve Been Gone&quot; is a generic doo-wop a cappella track that details a lover&#x27;s torment after the object of his affections breaks up with him. Yankovic performed most of the vocals himself, and to make sure that he stayed on key, a scratch guitar track was recorded; when the song was mixed, the guitar track was removed. Bassist Steve Jay provides the low voices in the song. Finally, &quot;I&#x27;m So Sick of You&quot;, a style parody of Elvis Costello in which the singer tells his girlfriend all the things he hates about her.

===Parodies and polka===
The first parody recorded for the album was &quot;Cavity Search&quot;, a parody of U2&#x27;s hit &quot;Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me&quot;. The song, which recounts the horror of having to go to the dentist, features the sound of an actual dental drill. To enhance the dental theme of the song, Yankovic called in his actual dentist, who brought a real drill and a human tooth, which the two took turns drilling while recording. The second parody was a pastiche of TLC&#x27;s hit &quot;Waterfalls&quot; called &quot;Phony Calls&quot;, about prank calls. During the bridge, a clip from &quot;The Simpsons&quot; second season episode &quot;Blood Feud&quot; is played on top of the music. Because the sound clip was from a preexisting episode, Yankovic noted that &quot;it was a pretty sweet deal for the Simpsons&#x27; voice actors – they each got a nice pile of money, and they didn&#x27;t even have to come to the studio!&quot; Before the call you hear a phone number being dialed. The number is 372-5806, which at the time was guitarist Jim West&#x27;s home phone number. The next parody recorded for the album was &quot;Gump&quot;, a parody of &quot;Lump&quot; by the Presidents of the United States of America. The song recounts the basic plot to the 1994 film &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; about a naïve and slow-witted yet athletically prodigious native of Alabama who witnesses, and in some cases influences, some of the defining events of the latter half of the 20th century in the United States. &quot;Gump&quot; was released as the second single from the album, and received a video.

On January 15, 1996, Yankovic began recording the lead single for the album, &quot;Amish Paradise&quot;. Yankovic felt that parodying Coolio would pay off, because Coolio had &quot;such an identifiable image that a lot of things could be done [with]&quot;. He noted, &quot;I like to play around with people that have some- you know, a lot of style as opposed to somebody who&#x27;s kind of homogonized [sic] and bland and has no personality, and Coolio certainly kind of sticks out in a crowd.&quot; Yankovic felt that juxtaposing the original song&#x27;s &quot;gangsta&quot; themes with the Amish lifestyle would produce a humorous end result. After Yankovic revealed to his label that he would be doing a Coolio parody, they requested that the album artwork for the release also parody Coolio. Yankovic had been toying with the name &quot;Bad Hair Day&quot; for a time and felt that he could adequately use the name and lampoon Coolio – who was known for his distinct hair style – at the same time. The final parody recorded for the album, &quot;Syndicated Inc.&quot;, is a parody of &quot;Misery&quot; by Soul Asylum, a loving ode to syndicated television.

Much like Yankovic&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Bad Hair Day&quot; features a polka medley of then-current hit songs, &quot;The Alternative Polka&quot;. &quot;The Alternative Polka&quot; originally contained the chorus of Weezer&#x27;s song &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; performed by Yankovic, but the song&#x27;s writer, Weezer front man Rivers Cuomo, requested its removal just before the album&#x27;s release. Yankovic was forced to physically cut the bit out of the master tape, but Weezer was still given credit in the liner notes because the notes were already printed. On June 25, 2010, over 14 years after the album&#x27;s release, Yankovic released the un-mixed and un-mastered &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; clip on his official YouTube channel.

===Unused parodies===
In addition to the five parodies on the album, Yankovic had several parody ideas that were turned down. Originally, Yankovic wanted to turn the Offspring&#x27;s hit &quot;Come Out and Play&quot; into an ode about doing laundry called &quot;Laundry Day&quot;. There are conflicting stories as to why the song was never recorded; either Yankovic never approached the Offspring about releasing the parody, or the band denied permission. Either way, Yankovic performed the song in concert from 1996 through 2000. Despite not being able to parody &quot;Come Out and Play&quot;, Yankovic would later be granted permission to parody their 1998 hit &quot;Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)&quot; as &quot;Pretty Fly for a Rabbi&quot; on his 1999 album &quot;Running with Scissors&quot;. Yankovic also wanted to record a parody of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Anthology&quot; hit &quot;Free as a Bird&quot; titled &quot;Gee, I&#x27;m a Nerd&quot;. Yankovic asked Paul McCartney, a supporter of Yankovic&#x27;s work, if he could parody &quot;Free as a Bird&quot;. McCartney had no problem with the parody, but because &quot;Free as a Bird&quot; was written by John Lennon, McCartney deferred the decision to Yoko Ono, who denied permission because she was uncomfortable with the parody idea.

Yankovic had also intended to record a parody of the U2 song &quot;Numb&quot; and a parody of the Rembrandts&#x27;s hit song &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There for You&quot;. The &quot;Numb&quot; spoof would have been called &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot;, a song in which Yankovic recited various lines from the Dr. Seuss book of the same name. U2 approved the parody, but Yankovic was unable to get permission from the Seuss estate. Likewise, Yankovic had wanted to turn &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There for You&quot; into &quot;I&#x27;ll Repair For You&quot;, and write it about the popular 1990s sitcom &quot;Home Improvement&quot;. The Rembrandts had also given approval when Yankovic asked, but the producers of &quot;Friends&quot; did not want the theme song to get overexposed and refused permission. All of the rejected parodies were later performed in concert.

==Controversy==

The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Amish Paradise&quot;, caused a minor controversy after rapper Coolio said that Yankovic had never asked for permission to record the parody. Yankovic traditionally secures permission from the artists he parodies, even though this is not legally required, as parodies are covered under fair use guidelines, but when he inquired about &quot;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&quot;, Yankovic was told by Scotti Brothers Records that Coolio had given permission. Coolio later claimed that he had not given such permission, making a statement at the Grammys saying that he did not appreciate Yankovic &quot;desecrating&quot; his song.

Speculation surfaced that Coolio had actually given permission but later changed his mind, or that Yankovic&#x27;s record label had lied to Yankovic in the hopes that the song would become popular. Yankovic later stated on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot; that he had written a sincere letter of apology to Coolio which was never returned, and that Coolio never complained when he received his royalty check from proceeds of the song. A series of photos taken at the XM Satellite Radio booth at the 2006 Consumer Electronics Show, as well as a post on the &quot;Ask Al&quot; feature on Yankovic&#x27;s website, suggested that Yankovic and Coolio made amends. According to Yankovic, he was very surprised when Coolio came over to chat. He later joked on his site&#x27;s Q&amp;A feature that, &quot;I doubt I&#x27;ll be invited to Coolio&#x27;s next birthday party but at least I can stop wearing that bulletproof vest to the mall.&quot;

==Promotion==
Scotti Brothers Records developed a promotion strategy for &quot;Bad Hair Day&quot;, which included Yankovic dressing up in exaggerated Coolio-styled hair and presenting an award at the American Music Awards in January 1996. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, this was &quot;a hint as to who would be the next victim of a Yankovic parody&quot;. &quot;Amish Paradise&quot; was then released in the very beginning of March as a radio and commercial single, when &quot;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&quot; was still receiving radio airplay. Four days later, the video was released. The album&#x27;s success was also bolstered by the release of &quot;Gump&quot; as a single on April 25, and a video four days later. In addition, WEA, who had taken over distributing Scotti Brothers&#x27; albums from BMG, helped with the initial release of the album.

To promote the album, Yankovic undertook the &quot;Bad Hair Tour&quot;, which spanned from May 24, 1996, to October 19, 1997. The tour was largely centered in the United States, although the first half saw Yankovic perform in Canada. Yankovic performed over 130 shows during the tour. Initially, there were preliminary plans to have Yankovic tour Europe, based on whether All American Music Group would secure the album&#x27;s international release, although this venture never came to fruition.

==Reception==

=== Critical reception ===
Mike Joyce of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that &quot;Amish Paradise&quot; was &quot;by far the cleverest and funniest track that &quot;Bad Hair Day&quot; has to offer [and] it ranks right up there with such Yankovic classics as &#x27;Another One Rides the Bus&#x27;, &#x27;Smells Like Nirvana&#x27; and &#x27;Eat It&#x27;.&quot; He also enjoyed &quot;Gump&quot;, but felt that the remainder of the parodies were weak, particularly citing &quot;Cavity Search&quot; as &quot;a sophomoric attempt to extract yuks&quot;. However, Joyce noted that &quot;some of the biggest laugh-getters&quot; on the album were Yankovic&#x27;s originals.

A record review from the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; concluded that &quot;&#x27;Weird Al&#x27; Yankovic&#x27;s ninth collection of original songs and parodies reinforces his reign as pop music&#x27;s King of Comedy&quot;, and that the record &quot;showcases Yankovic&#x27;s unparalleled ability to capture the styles of other bands and turn boring pop songs into fun tunes.&quot; J. D. Considine of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; noted that while Yankovic&#x27;s music can be &quot;sophomoric and silly&quot;, Yankovic himself &quot;can also be pretty smart&quot;. The review highlighted, among other songs, &quot;The Alternative Polka&quot; and &quot;The Night Santa Went Crazy&quot;, as some of the album&#x27;s best songs.

Not all reviews were positive. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic criticized the lack of humor on the album saying &quot;the music on &quot;Bad Hair Day&quot; not only lacks the humor, it lacks the impish energy that made Weird Al&#x27;s first albums such fun.&quot; The &quot;Rolling Stone Record Guide&quot; awarded the album two out of five stars. However, the book later referred to the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Amish Paradise&quot;, as &quot;gut-busting.&quot;

=== Commercial performance ===
&quot;Bad Hair Day&quot; was released on March 12, 1996, and eventually became Yankovic&#x27;s best selling album. Domestically, the album debuted at number 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 on March 30, 1996. It eventually peaked at number 14. The album remained on the chart for a total of 56 weeks, making it Yankovic&#x27;s longest-charting album. In 1996 alone, the album sold 1,317,000 copies in the United States, setting a record for the most copies a comedy album sold in a year during the Nielsen SoundScan era. On May 15, 1996, Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified &quot;Bad Hair Day&quot; gold, and then on June 11 of the same year, it certified the record platinum. In May 2014, it was announced that the album had sold 2.025 million copies in the U.S., making it the fourth best selling comedy album of the Nielsen Soundscan era. On October 3, 2019, the album was officially certified double-platinum by the RIAA.

The album was also successful in Canada, where it peaked at No. 9 on the Canadian Albums Chart, and was later certified Platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA), for sales over 100,000 copies.

<text>Antonio de Cabezón (30 March 1510 – 26 March 1566) was a Spanish Renaissance composer and organist. Blind from childhood, he quickly rose to prominence as a performer and was eventually employed by the royal family. He was among the most important composers of his time and the first major Iberian keyboard composer.

==Life==

Cabezón was born in Castrillo Mota de Judíos, a municipality near Burgos, in the north of Spain. Nothing is known about his formative years. He became blind in early childhood, and he may have been educated at the Palencia Cathedral by the organist there, García de Baeza. At the time, the country was slowly entering its &quot;Golden Age&quot;. On 14 March 1516, Charles V was proclaimed King of Castile and of Aragon jointly with his mother, the first time the crowns of Castile and Aragon were united under the same king. After the death of his paternal grandfather, Maximilian, in 1519, Charles also inherited the Habsburg lands in Austria, and later went on to become Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire and one of the most powerful monarchs in the world.

In 1525, Charles married Isabella of Portugal, further strengthening his position in Spain. It was Isabella who employed Cabezón into her service in 1526. His duties included playing the clavichord and the organ, and he also assumed the position of organist at the chapel Isabella organized soon after her wedding. The composer remained with the royal family for the rest of his life. Through the court, he met such important composers as vihuelist Luis de Narváez, known today for his advanced polyphonic fantasias, and Tomás de Santa María, theorist and composer whose important treatise on instrumental music, &quot;Arte de tañer fantasía&quot;, was examined and approved by Cabezón.

In 1538, Cabezón was made &quot;músico de la cámara&quot; (chamber musician) to Charles (who as a child was educated in music by the noted organist Henry Bredemers). After Isabella&#x27;s death in 1539, Cabezón was appointed music teacher to her children: Prince Felipe and his sisters Maria and Joan (Maria would later become the most important patron of composer Tomás Luis de Victoria). In 1543 Felipe became Regent of Spain, and he made Cabezón his court organist. Cabezón&#x27;s duties included playing a portative organ for Felipe on his journeys. On 19 July 1546 Cabezón&#x27;s brother Juan, also an organist and composer, was appointed musician in the royal chapel of Prince Felipe. Since the late 1540s Antonio and Juan both accompanied Felipe on his various trips, and visited Italy, the Netherlands, Germany (in 1548–49), and England (in 1554–56), where Antonio&#x27;s variations may have influenced William Byrd and Thomas Tallis, who later took up the form.

Practically nothing is known about Cabezón&#x27;s personal life. He married one Luisa Nuñez de Mocos from Ávila, and the couple had five children. One of Antonio&#x27;s sons, Hernando de Cabezón (1541–1602) became a composer, and it was through his efforts that the bulk of Antonio&#x27;s oeuvre was preserved. Another son, Agustín de Cabezón (who died before 1564), became a chorister of the royal chapel. Cabezón died in Madrid on 26 March 1566.

==Works==

A few of Cabezón&#x27;s works appeared in print during his lifetime in Luis Venegas de Henestrosa&#x27;s compilation &quot;Libro de cifra nueva&quot; (Alcalá de Henares, 1557). However, the bulk of his compositions was published posthumously by his son Hernando in a volume titled &quot;Obras de música para tecla, arpa y vihuela&quot; (Madrid, 1578). Together these collections contain some 275 pieces, most for organ or other keyboard instruments. Cabezón also composed instrumental music for plucked string instruments and ensembles, and vocal music, but only a single vocal piece survives: &quot;Invocación a la letanía&quot;, in the &quot;Cancionero de la Casa de Medinaceli&quot;. A mention of a mass by Cabezón is contained in a 1611 inventory of music from Cuenca Cathedral, but the actual music is lost, as are, presumably, many other works by the composer. A good keyboard improviser, many works by Antonio de Cabezón transcribed by his son Hernando were &quot;mere crumbs from my father&#x27;s table&quot;.

===Liturgical organ music===
While French and Italian organists of the time frequently composed organ masses, in Spain this practice was limited to &quot;versos&quot; on the Kyrie. Consequently, most of Cabezón&#x27;s liturgical music was intended for the Daily Offices—prescribed prayers of the daily round. Music for Mass is represented by the nine sets of Kyrie verses for organ. These fall into the following groups:
* &quot;Kyrie de Nuestra Señora&quot;, a three-voice setting, three parts (Kyrie, Christe, Kyrie) with the &quot;cunctipotens&quot; (&quot;Mass IV&quot;) chant in the tenor.
* &quot;Tema Rex virginum&quot;, a four-voice setting, four parts (on the same chant: Kyrie, Kyrie, Christe, Kyrie rather than the expected even verses K-Chr-Chr-K)
* &quot;Kyries de primer, segundo, [...] septimo tono&quot;, seven four-voice settings, all in four parts (Kyrie, Christe, Christe, Kyrie); the original source places &quot;quinto tono&quot; last, possibly by mistake.
Cabezón&#x27;s music for the Daily Offices comprises 32 hymns and three collections of versets for the psalms and for the Magnificats:
* &quot;Salmodia para principiantes&quot; (sets of four &quot;versillos&quot; on each of the 8 psalm tones &quot;for beginners&quot;)
* &quot;Fabordon y glosas&quot; [&quot;del primer, segundo, [...] tono&quot;] (faburdens with 3 &quot;glosas&quot; or divisions in upper, bass and inner voices for each tone)
* &quot;Salmodia para el Magnificat&quot; (7 Magnificat verses for each tone)

===Tientos===
The tiento was a polyphonic form of instrumental music that originated in the Iberian peninsula, and has been linked to both tastar de corde (an improvisatory prelude) and the ricercar (an improvisatory prelude or, at a later stage of development, a strict imitative composition). Twenty-nine tientos by Cabezón survive. Fourteen appeared in &quot;Libro de cifra nueva&quot;: these works are all written out in long note values, alternating between imitative counterpoint and non-imitative sections. Usually there are three or four themes, and the first to be presented is also the most developed. The non-imitative parts frequently employ techniques unusual for the genre at the time: extended duets, motifs transforming into ostinato patterns. Twelve more tientos appear in &quot;Obras de música&quot;: six from an earlier period in Cabezón&#x27;s career, and six late works. While the earlier pieces are similar in many respects to the &quot;Libro de cifra&quot; pieces, Cabezón&#x27;s late tientos use smaller note values, have a tendency towards longer and more characteristic subjects, and many of their features anticipate the music of the Baroque period.

===Variations===
Nine sets of variations (in Spanish tradition called &quot;discantes&quot;, &quot;diferencias&quot;, or &quot;glosas&quot;) are included in &quot;Obras de musica&quot;:
# &quot;Diferencias sobre las Vacas&quot; (3 variations)
# &quot;Pavana italiana&quot; (6 variations)
# &quot;Diferencias sobre la Gallarda milanese&quot; (2 variations)
# &quot;Diferencias sobre el canto del Caballero&quot; (5 variations)
# &quot;Diferencias sobre la Pavana italiana&quot; (5 variations)
# &quot;Diferencias sobre el canto de&quot; La Dama le demanda (6 variations on Arbeau&#x27;s &quot;La Belle qui tiens ma vie&quot;)
# &quot;Diferencias sobre el villancico De quién teme enojo Isabel&quot; (7 variations)
# &quot;Diferencias sobre las Vacas&quot; (6 variations)
# &quot;Otras diferencias de Vacas&quot; (4 variations)
Cabezón&#x27;s variations are one of the earliest high points of the genre, and presumably influenced English composers such as Thomas Tallis and William Byrd. All of the variation sets begin with the first variation, assuming the theme is already known to the listener, and connect individual variations using free transitions, thus frequently making analysis of the structure complicated. Cabezón uses numerous techniques, such as a migrating and/or heavily ornamented cantus firmus. The models are taken from popular Spanish songs, dance forms, and established melodic-harmonic frameworks.

===Intabulations===
The intabulations in &quot;Obras de música&quot; are ordered according to polyphonic complexity, starting with the simpler four-part pieces and culminating with six-part ones. They are based on works by composers such as Josquin des Prez and Orlande de Lassus and are more or less similar to most such compositions of the period.

<text>Sir William Eric Kinloch Anderson (27 May 1936 – 22 April 2020) was a British teacher and educator, who was headmaster of Eton College from 1980 to 1994 and provost of Eton College from September 2000 to January 2009. He is notable also for having played a part in the education of a King and four Prime Ministers, at four separate educational institutions (two in Scotland and two in England).

==Life and career==

Anderson was born on 27 May 1936 and schooled at George Watson&#x27;s College, Edinburgh. He graduated from the University of St Andrews with first-class honours in English language and literature and then a Master of Letters (MLitt) degree from Balliol College, University of Oxford.

During his early career, Anderson taught at Fettes College in Edinburgh and at Gordonstoun where he taught Prince Charles and directed him as Macbeth in the school play. He moved back to Fettes (1966-70) and then to be headmaster at Abingdon School (1970–75), Shrewsbury School (1975–80) and Eton College (1980–94) and he was rector of Lincoln College, Oxford (1994–2000), when its undergraduate students included Rishi Sunak. He was chairman of the Heritage Lottery Fund (1998–2001) and provost of Eton College (2000–2009).

At Fettes, he was Prime Minister Tony Blair&#x27;s housemaster. Blair subsequently named Anderson in a 1997 advertising campaign run by the Teacher Training Agency, entitled &quot;No one forgets a good teacher&quot;. He was Headmaster of Eton while David Cameron and Boris Johnson were there, as well as Rory Stewart, the Olympic oarsman Matthew Pinsent and the actors Dominic West and Damian Lewis. He was a supporter of the direct grant system.

The Clarendon Press published Anderson&#x27;s edition of &quot;The Journal of Sir Walter Scott&quot; in 1972 and he became a trustee of Scott&#x27;s Abbotsford during its refurbishment. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1985 and, in 2002, he was appointed a Knight of the Order of the Thistle.

He retired as provost of Eton on 30 January 2009, and was succeeded by William Waldegrave.

His other positions included visitor at Harris Manchester College, Oxford; member of the visiting committee of Harvard University Memorial Church; trustee of the Royal Collection Trust; and chairman of Cumberland Lodge. He received honorary degrees from the University of St Andrews, Hull, Siena, Birmingham, the University of Aberdeen and Buckingham.

==Personal life==
Anderson was the son of William James Kinloch Anderson, proprietor of the Edinburgh-based kilt-making business Kinloch Anderson, and Margaret Gouinlock Harper. He was married to Elizabeth (&quot;Poppy&quot;) Anderson, daughter of William and Mary Mason of Skipton. Their son is David Anderson (Lord Anderson of Ipswich KBE KC), and their daughter Kate is married to Will Gompertz.

He was an honorary Old Abingdonian and in 2018 accompanied Poppy, Kate and Will Gompertz, to open Beech Court at Abingdon School. 
Anderson died on 22 April 2020 at the age of 83, two days after his 60th wedding anniversary.

<text>Lawrence C. Ross Jr. (born February 20, 1966) is an author of historical texts and fiction.

==Life==
He was born in Los Angeles, California, and attended Loyola High School and then University of California, Berkeley, and UCLA, where he earned a degree in history. 
Ross has a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degree from the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television, in screenwriting.

<doc id="681794" wikidata="Q378806" url="?curid=681794" title="The Duel at Daytona">
<text>The Duel at Daytona, formerly known as the Twin 125s, is a NASCAR Cup Series preliminary event to the Daytona 500 held annually in February at Daytona International Speedway. It consists of two races, which both serve as a qualifying race for the Daytona 500. The finishing order in the two races, held on the Thursday before the Daytona 500, determine the starting lineup for the Daytona 500 held on race day.

Qualifying for the Daytona 500 is unique in NASCAR. Only the two front row starters (the pole and &quot;outside pole&quot;) are determined by the standard knockout qualifying system. For all other drivers it only determines their starting position in their Duel, with odd placed cars being entered into the first Duel and even placed cars going in the second. After the Top 2 positions are locked in, the next 30 places of starting grid of the Daytona 500 is set by the finishing order of these two races with the top 15 (excluding pole winner and outside pole) making up the next 15 places on the inside and outside lanes respectively. After the Duels are completed the four fastest non-qualifiers by time and finally the six or seven (if no past champion&#x27;s exemption is needed) highest-earning teams in points (from the previous season&#x27;s standings) not in the race yet advance (also set by time), and the starting grid for the Daytona 500 would then be set. The order is still subject to change if technical regulations are violated.

==History==

The event began as twin 100-mile (40-lap) races. From 1959 to 1971, the races were counted with points towards the Grand National championship. Purses awarded were counted separately from those awarded in the Daytona 500. For 1968, the races were scheduled for each, but were cancelled due to rain, and the starting lineup for the 1968 Daytona 500 fell back on the timed laps. In 1969, the races were extended again to 125 miles (50 laps). Lengthening the races added the need for a pit stop, increasing the complexity and excitement of the races.

For 1972, NASCAR&#x27;s modern era commenced, so races were required to be at least to be included as official points events. The Daytona qualifying races continued, however, as a non-points event. ABC first aired the races in 1971 as part of &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; highlights show. CBS took over in 1979, showing the races tape-delayed and edited the day before the Daytona 500.

With the introduction of restrictor plates in 1988, the resulting reduction in speed and fuel consumption again allowed drivers to possibly complete the race without a pit stop. Nine times from 1988 to 2004, one of the races went without a caution, and without a pit stop by the winner. In 2003, rules had been put in place requiring smaller fuel tanks on restrictor plate tracks (from down to ), which effectively forced a pit stop once again.

Starting in 2001, the races were shown live on television, as the Daytona 500 would rotate between FOX/FX and NBC/TNT from 2001 to 2006.

In 2005, the races were lengthened to 150 miles (60-laps), given a new name, the Gatorade Duel, and from 2005 to 2012, used NASCAR&#x27;s All-Exempt Tour format (similar to golf, but better known within NASCAR circles as the &quot;top 35 rule&quot;). The grids changed from even-odd qualifiers to a combination of even-odd based on the front row drivers by speed, then previous year&#x27;s points standings (even-odd) of exempt and non-exempt teams by speed. A rain delay in 2006 saw the second race finish under the lights.

Starting in 2007, the Gatorade Duel is shown live on Speed, under the new broadcast agreement. That same year, allegations of cheating involving Michael Waltrip Racing came up. In 2013, Budweiser took over as sponsor of the Duels.

During Speedweeks 2013, Daytona International Speedway announced that the qualifying races would be held in prime-time and under stadium lighting on the Thursday before the Daytona 500 beginning in 2014, the races&#x27; debut on Fox Sports 1.

From 2016 to 2018, the races were renamed the Can-Am Duel after new title sponsor Bombardier Recreational Products&#x27; range of Can-Am All-terrain vehicles.

Beginning in 2017 The Duels became a points event once again in with the unveiling of a new race format. Under the new format still in use as of 2024 the race awards regular season points for the top ten drivers in each duel with 10 points being awarded to the winners and finishers in 2nd to 10th place earning 9 points to 1 point in increments of one point per position.

==Format==
*Busch Pole qualifying is currently held the week of the Daytona 500. Since 2021, it has been held the Wednesday of the race week. Prior to that, it was held the Sunday before (except in 2010, when qualifying was held on Saturday to avoid conflict with Super Bowl XLIV) starting from 2003, the Saturday before until 2002 (except for 1992), and the Wednesday before prior to the 1980s. Standard three-round knockout qualifying procedures are used for restrictor plate tracks. The fastest qualifier in the third round wins the pole position for the Daytona 500, and second fastest in the third round is considered the second starting position, also known as the &quot;outside pole&quot;. Both front row starters are locked into those positions on the Daytona 500 starting grid.
*The two fastest qualifiers above (the Daytona 500 pole winner and the &quot;outside pole&quot; winner) are awarded the first starting position on the grid for each of the two Duel races, respectively.
*Drivers who qualify in odd-numbered positions in Q3 start in the first Duel, while those who qualify in even-numbered ones in that round start in the second Duel. This fills positions 1–6 in each Duel.
*The 12 drivers eliminated after Q2 have their Q2 times determine their starting position. The fastest driver eliminated in Q2, based on Q2 times only, starts 7th in the first Duel, while the second-fastest driver in Q2 starts in that position in the second one and based on position of elimination from Q2, they start in the first (odd) or second (even) numbered positions.
*Drivers eliminated after Q1 will have Q1 times determine their starting position. The fastest driver eliminated in Q1 starts 13th in the first Duel, while the second-fastest driver eliminated in Q1 starts in there in the second one.

===Pre-charter format (except 2005–12)===
*The Top 15 (14 until 2004) finishers in each Twin 125 race (excluding the two original front row qualifiers) advanced to the Daytona 500 starting lineup.
**The Top 15 (14 until 2004) from the first race (excluding the original pole position winner) filled the inside portions of rows 2 through 16 (15 until 2004).
**The Top 15 (14 until 2004) from the second race (excluding the original outside pole winner) filled the outside portions of rows 2 through 16 (15 until 2004).
*After both races, the remaining non-qualifiers revert to their original qualifying speeds. Until NASCAR imposed the charter system in 2016, the four fastest remaining cars were assigned positions 33–36. This format has been in place from 1998 to 2003 and 2013 to 2015. This rule was to generally protect fast qualifying cars that suffered a crash or engine failure during the heats.
**In 2015 with knockout qualifying, a driver&#x27;s qualifying speed is based on his fastest, regardless of it taking place in Q1, Q2, or Q3.
**For 1998–2003, qualifying speeds filled positions 31–36.
**For 1995–1997 and 2004, qualifying speeds filled positions 31–38.
**Through 1994, qualifying speeds filled positions 31–40.
*The final starting positions (37-42) were reserved for provisionals. The highest entries in championship owner points (not driver points) from the previous season that have not yet made the field are assigned grid positions 37–42.
**Prior to 1995, the provisional system varies, with typically two cars added.
**From 1995 to 1997, four provisionals were used.
**From 1998 to 2003, seven provisionals were used.
**In 2004, five provisionals were used.
**Provisionals are assigned by owner points from the previous season.
*Since 1990, the 43rd and final spot on the grid were tentatively reserved for the most recent NASCAR Cup champion not yet in the field. The &quot;Champions Provisional&quot; is used if needed, but if there are no former Cup champions in need of the slot, it reverts to a standard provisional spot. (This provisional was abolished with the charter system in 2016.)
*Since 2013, after the seven provisionals are assigned, the starting order of positions 37 through 40 is determined by fastest qualifying speeds. Under the current charter system, the rule is in effect, but only for positions 39 and 40, for open (non-chartered) cars.

===All Exempt Tour Format/&quot;Top 35 Rule&quot; (2005–2012)===
Between the 2005 and 2012 seasons, the Duel used different rules because of NASCAR&#x27;s All Exempt Tour format (better known as the &quot;top 35 rule&quot;) used at the time for the NASCAR Cup Series.
*All exempt teams (the previous season&#x27;s Top 35 teams through owner points), along with the two drivers who qualified for the front row – the top two drivers from qualifying (if they are not exempt teams) are locked into the Daytona 500 starting field, regardless of finishing position in the Duel races.
*The pole position winner is given the pole for the first Duel, and the driver who qualifies second is given the pole for the second Duel; regardless of their exempt status.
*Exempt teams (excluding the pole and &quot;outside pole&quot; winners) are split among the two Duels based on their owner points position from the previous season. Odd-numbered points positions are entered into the first Duel and even-numbered points positions are entered into the second Duel.
** If both teams on the front row in the Daytona 500 are even-positioned teams from the previous year&#x27;s points (and would be in Duel 2), the slowest exempt team of the odd-positioned teams, based on the final points standings from the previous year, is moved to Duel 2. This was used in the 2012 Duels.
*Non-exempt entries are split between the two qualifying races. The top qualifier among non-exempt teams provided the team is not on the front row is slotted into the second race (along with even ranked non-exempt qualifiers) are split into the second race, and even ranked qualifiers are in the first race (as if they were called 36th and 37th, et al.), unless both front row starters were odd or even teams from the previous year, or if one of the two non-exempt teams makes the front row.
*After the participants are determined for the two Duels, the actual lineups for the two Duels revert to overall time trial speed rank.
*The Top 2 finishers among the non-exempt teams (excluding any that happened to qualify on the front row) from each Duel advance to the Daytona 500.
*Starting positions 3-39 are finalized by Duel finishes. Drivers from the first Duel start on the inside and drivers from the second Duel start on the outside.
**Starting positions 3-40 (or 41) are finalized in this manner if one (or both) front row starter is a non-exempt team.
*One to four additional positions are filled by non-exempt entries by original time trial speeds.
** If both front row starters are non-exempt teams, only one position is available. If the 43rd position is not needed, two positions are available.
** If one front row starters is a non-exempt team, two (or three) positions are available.
** If both front row starters are exempt teams, three (or four) positions are available. This brings the field to 42 cars.
* If there is a former NASCAR Cup Series champion driver who raced in the previous season racing for a non-exempt team and has yet to qualify, the most recent former champion not in the field yet takes the 43rd position. It is not unusual for a non-exempt team to seek out a former champion as their driver, as it provides an easier way to qualify. Otherwise, an extra position by time is available.

===Charter-era format===
Under the current charter system, because all chartered entries are guaranteed entry to every race of a season:
*All finishers driving for chartered teams in each Duel (excluding the two original front row qualifiers) advanced to the Daytona 500 starting lineup; the first race determines the starting position of the inside row and the second determines the outside row.
*The highest-placed &quot;open&quot; entry (entering the race without a charter) of each duel race will advance, based on their finishing position (for a total of two cars each). This also determines their starting position.
*Two fastest non-chartered drivers that advanced based on qualifying speeds alone will start on the last row of the Daytona 500, for a total of four non-chartered cars (NASCAR reduced the starting grid from 43 to 40 with the introduction of the system). 
**If the &quot;open&quot; driver that was the top unchartered entry in the duel race was also the fastest non-chartered driver in the time trials, the fastest &quot;open&quot; driver not locked-in that way will advance on their qualifying time alone. Otherwise, their time would be used as a fallback for them to start on the last row of the event.
*Starting in 2025, should an Open Exemption Provisional (OEP) entry was not the top &quot;open&quot; driver in either time trials or their duel, they will also advance to the race as the 41st car on the grid (assuming 40 cars on the final grid). However, if the OEP entry was the fastest in either time trials, or was the top finishing unchartered entry in their race, they will qualify normally as the 40th entry; no non-OEP car will enter as the 41st car in that case.

The arrangement of the Duels under the charter system notably cost Ty Dillon a starting spot in 2021 when Ryan Preece beat him during the Duels as Dillon, despite still finishing in the top-10, did not have a fast enough qualifying time compared to his non-chartered peers.

===Early years===
*In the early years of the Daytona 500, the rules for the qualifying races varied widely. In 1959, the first race comprised the Convertible series, while the second comprised the Grand National series. The Top 20 finishers in each race advanced to the Daytona 500, while a last-chance, consolation race was held on Saturday, to fill the field to a maximum of 65 cars.
*In early years, the qualifying races were held on the Friday prior to the Daytona 500, rather than the current Thursday.
*On rare occasions, a 75-mile &quot;consolation race&quot; was also held.
*In some early years, pole qualifying for the Daytona 500 was held on Wednesday, the day before the qualifying races. It was eventually moved up to the weekend before, and returned to Wednesday in 2021.
*Typically, until 2014, the faster of two laps in single-car qualifying determined starting positions for the Duels and the front row for the 500.

==Notes==
*In 2010, Jimmie Johnson and Kasey Kahne had a combined victory margin of .019 over second place drivers Kevin Harvick and Tony Stewart.
*Dale Earnhardt set a record by winning one of the Twin 125 races for ten consecutive years, twelve times overall, as well as six Bud Shootouts, before winning the 1998 Daytona 500.
*Jeff Gordon won a Twin 125 in 1993, his rookie season. It marked his first win in a NASCAR Winston Cup event, however, it did not count as an official points-paying victory. Jeff would go on to finish 5th in that year&#x27;s Daytona 500. He did not win an official points race until the 1994 Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte.
*In 2007 Jeff Gordon won the race, but failed the post race inspection. He then &quot;earned&quot; the lowest Daytona 500 starting spot for a race winner, starting in 42nd place, but he was still credited with the victory.
*Since the race became a non-championship heat race in 1971, two drivers who did not win a Cup race, Coo Coo Marlin and Mike Skinner, have won the race.
*Four drivers have been killed in qualifying races. Talmadge &quot;Tab&quot; Prince was killed in 1970, Raymond &quot;Friday&quot; Hassler in 1972, Ricky Knotts in 1980 and Bruce Jacobi in 1983 (although he was in a coma for four years before dying in 1987).
*Denny Hamlin won the second Gatorade Duel on February 14, 2008, making him the first ever Toyota driver to win a NASCAR Cup Series race.
* A driver each from Hendrick Motorsports and Joe Gibbs Racing won the Duel races from 2007 to 2009.
*Randy LaJoie suffered a horrific crash in the 1984 UNO Twin 125 event when he spun out of turn 4, got airborne and slammed hard into the wall, then performed two backflips and a barrel roll, in an identical position as Ricky Rudd&#x27;s Busch Clash accident days earlier. A rash of Turn 4 incidents (including Darrell Waltrip&#x27;s crash in the same area that resulted in a concussion that would have suspended him from competition immediately under current NASCAR rules during the previous year&#x27;s Daytona 500) resulted in the grass apron graded and paved over for the Firecracker 400 that July.
*Oddly, despite Richard Petty&#x27;s wins at Daytona in championship competition, none of his official 200 wins included a qualifying race (1959–71).
*2000 was Bill Elliott&#x27;s only win as an owner/driver.

==Past winners==

===Race notes ===
*1961: First race was shortened due to crash.
*1974: Both races were shortened due to energy crisis (10% shorter).
*2006: Both races were extended due to a green–white–checker finish.
*2007, 2011 and 2018: First race was extended due to a NASCAR overtime.
*2008, 2015 and 2021: Second race was extended due to a NASCAR overtime.

*2021: Second race was delayed 3 hours for rain, finished early Friday morning.
*2025: Erik Jones crossed the second duel&#x27;s finish line first, but due to a very late caution being called just before he passed Cindric, the latter was ruled to be the winner as he was determined to be the leader at the time of caution.

<doc id="681800" wikidata="Q2608812" url="?curid=681800" title="Morlock">
<text>Morlocks are one of the two fictional species of post-humans created by H. G. Wells for his 1895 novel &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (the other being the Eloi). They are the story&#x27;s main antagonists. Since their creation by H. G. Wells, the Morlocks have appeared in many other works such as sequels, films, television shows, and works by other authors, many of which have deviated from the original description.

In choosing the name &quot;Morlocks&quot;, Wells may have been inspired by Moloch, the Canaanite god of child sacrifice, with the Eloi analogous to children. Alternatively, he may have also been inspired by the Morlachs, an ethnic group in the Balkans which attracted attention from Western travellers as a perceived archetype of barbarism and backwardness.

==In &quot;The Time Machine&quot;==
The Morlocks are at first a mysterious presence in the book, in so far as the protagonist initially believes the Eloi are the sole descendants of humanity. Later, the Morlocks are made the story&#x27;s antagonists. They dwell underground beneath the English countryside of AD 802,701, maintaining ancient machines that they may or may not remember how to build. Their only access to the surface world is through a series of well-like structures that dot the countryside of future England.

After thousands of generations of living without sunlight, the Morlocks have come to resemble troglofauna. They are described as apelike, with dull grey-to-white skin, chinless faces, large greyish-red eyes with a capacity for reflecting light, and flaxen hair on the head and back. They are stronger than the Eloi, but smaller and weaker than the average human (the Time Traveller hurt or killed some barehanded with relative ease), but a large swarm of them could be a serious threat to a lone man, especially unarmed and/or without a light source. Unlike the Eloi, the Morlocks retain some of their human curiosity, initiative, and aggression: they are intrigued by the Time Traveller and band together to attack him when he invades their dwelling. Their language is composed of strange, unpleasant sounds, which the Time Traveller never deciphers. Their sensitivity to light usually prevents them from attacking during the day.

The relationship between the Morlocks and the Eloi is symbiotic: the Eloi are clothed, fed and possibly bred by the Morlocks, and the Morlocks consume the Eloi as a food source. Seeing this, the Time Traveller speculates that the relationship developed from a class distinction present in his own time: the Morlocks are descendants of the working class who were relegated to working and living underground so that the rich upper class could live in luxury on the surface. With time, the roles altered – the surface people grew apathetic and helpless to the point that they were no longer masters of their subterranean counterparts. However, the Morlocks must have continued to tend to the Eloi (the protagonist guesses this may at first have been out of tradition or intrinsic habit) and at some point began using them as livestock.

==In sequels and prequels to &quot;The Time Machine&quot;==
===&quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot;===

H. G. Wells also wrote a book called &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot; (1899). The book centers on a man who somehow falls asleep for several centuries, and wakes in the mid-21st century to find that his investments have done so well that he owns the world. An organization called the Labour Company has rounded up most of the world&#x27;s lower class, forcing them to work underground in terrible conditions for the sole benefit of the rich upper class. It would seem that these people will later degenerate to become the Morlocks. When the &quot;Sleeper&quot; encounters these (apparently) proto-Morlocks, he notes that they seem to be turning paler, as well as developing their own dialect of English.

===&quot;The Time Ships&quot;===
&quot;The Time Ships&quot; (1995), by Stephen Baxter is a canonical sequel to &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (1895) officially authorized by the Wells estate to mark the centenary of the original&#x27;s publication. In its wide-ranging narrative, the Time Traveller attempts to return to the world of tomorrow but instead finds that his actions have changed the future: one in which the Eloi have never manifested. Instead, the Earth is a nearly barren waste that has been abandoned in favour of a 220 million kilometres wide self-sustaining sphere around the Sun drawing its energy directly from sunlight (since it entirely encompasses the star and receives its whole energy output), where the Morlocks (and several other offshoots of humanity) now live.

Utterly peaceful, moralistic, and highly intelligent (Nebogipfel learns English in a matter of days and is soon able to speak it fluently – with some limitations due to the Morlocks&#x27; peculiar vocal apparatus, quite different from those of humans), the only resemblance these new Morlocks have to the monstrous cannibals of the first future is that of appearance and dwelling &quot;underground&quot;. The sphere they inhabit is divided into two concentric shells, with the Morlocks living exclusively inside the nearly featureless exterior. Above them, the inner shell where the sun shines openly is an Earth-like utopia. In its many forms and at many technological levels (from somehow familiar nowadays like industrial worlds, to worlds having anti-gravitational devices), they continue on here in much the same way as that of the Time Traveller&#x27;s era (with war being the most obvious holdover).

The Morlocks&#x27; civilization includes a variety of nation-groups based on thought and ideology, in which individuals move between without conflict. All needs are met by the sphere itself, including reproduction where the newly born are &quot;extruded&quot; directly from the floor. These peaceful intelligent Morlocks seem also to have extraordinary resistance to disease and perhaps to radiations too, even when not in their homeworld, as stated by Nebogipfel when in the Paleocene (the Time Traveller quickly got ill there because of unknown germs, whereas Nebogipfel, though injured and disabled, suffered no apparent ill effects).

The only Morlock given a name is Nebogipfel, who remains with the Time Traveller throughout the book. Nebogipfel&#x27;s name comes from the main character of H. G. Wells&#x27; first attempt at a time travel story, then called &quot;Chronic Argonauts&quot;. The character&#x27;s name was Dr. Moses Nebogipfel. (The name Moses was also used in &quot;The Time Ships&quot;, though it is given to the younger version of himself that the Time Traveller meets on his journey.)

===&quot;Morlock Night&quot;===
In K. W. Jeter&#x27;s novel &quot;Morlock Night&quot;, the Morlocks have stolen the Time Machine and used it to invade Victorian London. These Morlocks are much more formidable than those in &quot;The Time Machine&quot; – a clever, technological race with enough power to take over the entire world. They also get support from certain treacherous 19th century humans, especially a dark wizard named Merdenne. It is also revealed that the Morlocks living in their native time (the 8,028th century) have stopped allowing the Eloi to roam free and now keep them in pens.

The Morlocks are separated into two types, or castes, in the novel. One is the short, weak, stupid Grunt Morlocks, who are supposedly the kind that the Time Traveller encountered, and the other is the Officer Morlocks, who are taller, more intelligent, speak English, and have a high rank within the Morlock invasion force. An example of the latter type is Colonel Nalga, an antagonist later in the book.

These Morlocks are always described as wearing blueish spectacles, which are presumably to protect the Morlocks&#x27; sensitive, dark-adapted eyes.

* &quot;Die Reise mit der Zeitmaschine&quot; (1946, &quot;The Journey with the Time Machine&quot;), by Egon Friedell – translated by Eddy C.

It describes the Time Traveller&#x27;s further visits to the future, and the Time Machine&#x27;s entanglement with the past.
* &quot;The Man Who Loved Morlocks&quot; (1981), by David Lake. This novel recounts the Time Traveller&#x27;s second journey. This time, he meets the Morlocks again, but is equipped with a camera and a Colt revolver. This book is notable for portraying the Morlocks in a sympathetic, and completely different light. The Time Traveller discovers, on his second trip, that the Eloi and Morlocks of the future world are all dying due to a disease introduced by him on his first trip, to which they have no immunity. Traveling further into the future, he discovers a great and noble civilization, the beautiful inhabitants of which it is eventually learned are the descendants of the few surviving Morlocks. Also, an ancient journal is discovered, which tells the story of the Time Traveller&#x27;s first trip from the Morlocks&#x27; point of view, revealing that the Morlocks, rather than being hostile predators/farmers of the Eloi, were in fact the custodians of a kind of natural reserve dedicated to protecting and preserving them. The apparently hostile acts of the Morlocks are explained by showing the story from a different viewpoint.
* &quot;Time Machine Troopers&quot; (2011), by Hal Colebatch, published by Acashic. In this story, the time traveller returns to the future about 18 years beyond the time in which he first visited it, hoping to regenerate the Eloi, and taking with him Sir Robert Baden-Powell, who will later found the Boy Scout movement in England. They set out to teach the Eloi self-reliance and self-defence, but are captured by Morlocks. It turns out that the Eloi and Morlocks are both more complex than the time traveller had thought, also that Weena is still alive and leading an Eloi resistance movement. The story sets out to be an answer to Wells&#x27;s pessimism, as the Time Traveller and Baden-Powell seek to teach the future world scouting and cricket. Sir Winston Churchill and H. G. Wells himself also feature as characters.

==In other fiction==
Some authors have adopted the Morlocks and adapted them to their works, often completely unassociated with &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, or were named in-universe in homage to H.G. Wells&#x27; works.

The Morlocks appeared in a story by Alan Moore titled &quot;Allan and the Sundered Veil&quot;, which appeared as part of the comic book collection &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume I&quot;. In the story, the Time Traveller takes some of the regular League characters into his future world, where he has made a base out of the Morlock sphinx. The party is soon attacked by Morlocks, who are fierce, simian creatures in this story. They are physically much more powerful than Wells&#x27; creatures, although they&#x27;re similar to the Hunter Morlocks from the 2002 film.

Larry Niven included a version of the Morlocks in his &quot;Known Space&quot; books. They appear as a alien race living in the caves in one region of Wunderland, which is one of humanity&#x27;s colonies in the Alpha Centauri system. Many of these stories are by Hal Colebatch in the shared spin-off series, &quot;The Man Kzin Wars&quot;, especially in vols. X, XI and XII. They are also mentioned in stories in the same series by M. J. Harringtom.

In Joanna Russ&#x27; short story &quot;The Second Inquisition&quot;, &quot;The Time Machine&quot; is referenced a number of times, and the unnamed character referred to as &quot;our guest&quot; (who is evidently a visitor from the future) claims to be a Morlock, although she does not physically resemble Wells&#x27; Morlocks.

In the fictional universe of &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot;, Morlocks are the elite warriors of the Iron Hands chapter of space marines and feature in several Horus Heresy novels where they act as bodyguards for their primarch Ferrus Manus.

In the Marvel Comics universe, a number of mutants whose mutations are visually obvious dwell underground, calling themselves Morlocks.

The inhabitants of the Moscow metro are sometimes sarcastically referred to as Morlocks in Dmitry Glukhovsky&#x27;s &quot;Metro 2033&quot;.

A poem by J. R. R. Tolkien entitled &quot;Knocking at the Door: Lines Induced by Sensation When Waiting for an Answer at the Door of an Exalted Academic Person&quot;, has a reference to some &quot;Morlock Mountains&quot;. Though the poem was published on February 18 of 1937 in the fiftieth issue of the &quot;Oxford Magazine&quot;, Tolkien revised the poem in 1961 or 1962 as &quot;The Mewlips&quot;, changing &quot;Morlock&quot; to &quot;Merlock&quot; to avoid an association with H.G. Wells&#x27; Morlocks.

==In essays and non-fiction==
In Neal Stephenson&#x27;s essay on modern culture operating system development, &quot;In the Beginning... was the Command Line&quot;, he demonstrates similarities between the future in &quot;The Time Machine&quot; and contemporary American culture. He claims that most Americans have been exposed to a &quot;corporate monoculture&quot; which renders them &quot;unwilling to make judgments and incapable of taking stands.&quot; Anyone who remains outside of this &quot;culture&quot; is left with powerful tools to deal with the world, and it is they, rather than the neutered Eloi, that run things.

J. R. R. Tolkien mentioned Morlocks three times in his 1939 essay &quot;On Fairy-Stories&quot;, which discusses the genre now called fantasy. The first reference occurs where Tolkien attempts to define the genre, and he suggests that the Morlocks (and Eloi) place &quot;The Time Machine&quot; more in the genre than do the Lilliputians in &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;. He reasoned that the Lilliputians are merely diminutive humans, whereas the Morlocks and Eloi are significantly different from us, and &quot;live far away in an abyss of time so deep as to work an enchantment&quot;. Another reference to the creatures of &quot;The Time Machine&quot; occurs in the essay&#x27;s section &quot;Recovery, Escape, Consolation&quot;. Here it&#x27;s argued that fantasy offers a legitimate means of escape from the mundane world and the &quot;Morlockian horror of factories&quot;. Elsewhere in his essay, Tolkien warns against separating fantasy readers into superficial categories, using the Eloi and Morlocks as a dramatic illustration of the repercussions of sundering the human race.

==In film and television==
===&quot;The Time Machine&quot; (1960 film)===
The 1960 film version of &quot;The Time Machine&quot; directed by George Pal features Morlocks designed by Wah Chang. They are depicted as blue-skinned ape-like creatures with sloth-like hands and feet. Like the creatures in the novella, the Morlocks are unaccustomed to resistance and susceptible to blows. They are defeated in the end by the Eloi, who are motivated to fight back by the Time Traveller, George. The divergence between Eloi and Morlocks in this telling did not originate in a caste system, but instead originate after a nuclear war destroyed the world August 18, 1966.

The Morlocks in this film draw the Eloi to their doom through the use of air raid sirens. Sirens, which once warned their ancestors to seek shelter underground, now evoke an instinctual response in the Eloi: they go into a trance and proceed to Morlock realms, where the Morlocks finally herd them underground with whips.

===&quot;The Time Machine&quot; (1978 film)===
In the television film &quot;The Time Machine&quot; directed by Henning Schellerup (1928–2000) and first broadcast on US television on November 5, 1978, the protagonist Dr. Neil Perry (played by John Beck) travels with his time machine into the future to tell his company Mega Corporation, for which he developed an Antimatter bomb, about its future destructive impact on humanity. In the future, he witnessed the destruction of civilization, but also learns that nature has been revived from the wasteland and that some of the people who had previously sought refuge underground, the Eloi, have returned to the surface. The race that remained below the surface became the Morlocks, and when Perry arrives he watches as the Morlocks begin to harvest the Eloi as their food. Here, he also meets the Eloi girl Weena (played by Priscilla Barnes) who, unlike the other film adaptations, now has a brother named Ariel.

Weena leads Perry into a preserved technology museum, which also shows his bomb developed in the past for the Mega Corporation, and in a video animation he can see the damage caused by his bomb. Before Perry returns to his time, he and Ariel blow up three entrances to the Morlocks&#x27; caves with plastic explosives they found in the museum. When he travels back in time to tell his company about the dramatic effects of the bomb in the future, his superiors show disinterest. Perry travels to the future again to return to Weena and the Eloi and finds that their world is now free of the Morlocks.

===&quot;The Time Machine&quot; (2002 film)===
In 2002, another film based on &quot;The Time Machine&quot; was directed by Simon Wells, the great-grandson of H. G. Wells. The Morlocks in this film, as well as the Eloi, have been changed in several major ways. The Morlocks have become physically stronger and faster, and are very ape-like now, frequently running on all fours.

The movie displays three of these races:

* The Hunter Morlocks are Morlocks that hunt down and capture the Eloi. They are muscular, gorilla-like hunters. They have a powerful sense of smell used to track down the Eloi. Different actors portray the Hunter Morlocks: Richard Cetrone, Edward Conna, Chris Sayour, Jeremy Fitzgerald, Darrell Davis, Grady Holder, Bryan Friday, Clint Lilley, Mark Kubr, Jeff Podgurski, Dan McCann, Bryon Weiss, and Steve Upton.
* The Spy Morlocks are Morlocks that shoot them with blowgun darts (so as to make them detectable to the hunters). They are more slender and than the Hunter Morlocks, but much weaker. The Spy Morlocks shoot blowpipes at escaping Eloi, marking them with a pungent substance and making it easier for the Hunters. Different actors portray the Spy Morlocks: Joey Anaya, Jacob Chambers, Doug Jones, Dorian Kingi, and Kevin McTurk.
* The Über-Morlocks are Morlocks that command the first two races telepathically. They appear more human than the other two castes seen in the movie. Instead of having grey skin and patches of fur, the Über-Morlock (portrayed by Jeremy Irons) that appears in the film has long, flowing white hair and white skin, the general physique of a human, and clothing. His brain is so large that much of it is outside his head, trailing down his back and enveloping spine. He is telepathic and telekinetic, articulate in English speech, and eventually ends up fighting Alexander Hartdegen (the main character of this film).

As explained by the Über-Morlock when Alexander is brought to him while trying to save the Eloi Mara, the Morlocks originated from humans that sought shelter underground, after operation demolitions for constructing a colony on the Moon sent some of its fragments crashing to Earth. They remained underground for so long that they developed bodies with very little melanin in their skin and very sensitive eyes that could not tolerate sunlight for long. As a result of the past catastrophe and the resulting strain on resources, the proto-Morlocks divided themselves into several castes, two of which (the &#x27;Hunters&#x27; and the &#x27;Spies&#x27;) could survive in the daylight. They inbred within each caste until the Morlock race became composed of genetically fine-tuned sub-races designed for specific tasks.

During the climax of the film, Alexander kills the Über-Morlock by pushing him out of the moving time machine. The rest of the Morlocks are destroyed when Alexander causes his time machine to malfunction and explode in their tunnels.

===&quot;Time Machine: Rise of the Morlocks&quot;===
A 2011 television movie originally named &quot;Morlocks&quot; (renamed &quot;Time Machine: Rise of the Morlocks&quot;) produced for Syfy, starring David Hewlett, and Robert Picardo. The plot sees a time machine open a portal to the future allowing Morlocks to travel back to the present and wreak havoc. These Morlocks are descended from a patient with terminal cancer whose father used the military time travel project to look for technology in the future as a cure. One of the first Morlocks to escape through the portal into the present is captured and has its DNA extracted. Paradoxically, it is treatment with this DNA that causes the patient to mutate into the first Morlock.

===&quot;Mutant War&quot;===
Morlocks are briefly referenced by the protagonist in reference to the zombie-like mutant antagonists of the film.

===Television shows===
In the serial &quot;Timelash&quot; episodes of the twenty-second season of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, the Sixth Doctor takes H. G. Wells into the future where they encounter an underground-dwelling, reptilian species called the Morlox (a homophone of &quot;Morlocks&quot;). The Borad, an evil ruler, accidentally becomes half-Morlox before the episode.

In the 1978 &quot;Challenge of the Superfriends&quot; episode titled &quot;Conquerors of the Future&quot;, the episode featured Barlocks, a variation of the Morlocks in a time period when the Super Friends are long dead who lived outside a domed city that is Earth&#x27;s capital. The Barlocks have attacked it many times and are driven away by the bright lights. In addition, they aren&#x27;t very good at mastering the technology they have. When the Legion of Doom arrived and encountered the Barlocks, Lex Luthor formed an alliance with their leader (voiced by Ted Cassidy) and came up with a trick to take over the domed city. Afterwards, the Legion of Doom used them in their plans to conquer the galaxy with Lex Luthor leading the Barlocks to conquer the ruling planet of Sector 13 while Black Manta leads the Barlocks to conquer the ruling planet in the Outer Galaxy Region. When Superman, Green Lantern, and Flash arrive in this time after accidentally appearing in the farther future and finding a history book that details the history of Earth, they defeat the Legion of Doom as Flash uses his super-speed to place the Barlocks back in their cave. The inhabitants of Earth&#x27;s capital city sees to it that the planets the Legion of Doom and the Barlocks have conquered are liberated.

Homer Simpson mentions Morlocks in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Homer the Moe&quot;, claiming he became their king while telling a shaggy dog story.

In 2003, Peak Entertainment relaunched &quot;Monster in My Pocket&quot; with former lead villain Warlock as the hero. The new villain became Warlock&#x27;s evil twin Morlock. The series was passed on by Cartoon Network and Peak&#x27;s rights to &quot;Monster in My Pocket&quot; were revoked on December 22, 2004. With the series&#x27; limited distribution, it is difficult to say if the connection was more than a nominal one.

In 2006, a new incarnation of &quot;Power Rangers&quot;, titled &quot;Power Rangers: Mystic Force&quot;, includes Morlocks as the enemies of the Mystic Force Rangers. Sources from before the show&#x27;s premiere described them as &quot;zombie-like foot soldiers&quot; and it was also implied that they live underground below the town of Briarwood (where the show takes place) and plot to rise up and destroy everything. However, it has since been revealed that the Morlocks in the show are not simply foot soldiers; they comprise the entire group of enemies of the Power Rangers that have been led by Octomus. The Morlocks in the show are entirely unlike those in &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, except that they still live underground and are villains. These Morlocks are not portrayed as a divergent species of humanity, but instead as an ancient, evil legion who were sealed underground centuries ago. The Morlocks have finally broken the seal and are planning to invade Briarwood, and later the world. The term was used exclusively in promotional material and was never mentioned in the show.

On the episode of &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; called &quot;The Nerdvana Annihilation,&quot; Leonard Hofstadter and his friends chipped in to buy an original time machine prop from the 1960 film classic &quot;The Time Machine&quot;. None in the group was more excited about the purchase than Sheldon Cooper, who seemed to think he was the only one able to grasp the full possibilities of owning such a unique piece of memorabilia. His viewpoint changed drastically though, after he experienced a series of episode-ending dreams, all featuring the infamous cannibalistic Morlock species from the classic H. G. Wells book. The first dream was him travelling to the future on 28 April 802701 and being eaten alive by three Morlocks. When he wakes up, Leonard agrees to get rid of the time machine, but he hires Morlocks to do it (called Starving Morlocks). As they eat Sheldon, he wakes up again and yells for Leonard to help him.

In the 2010 episode of &quot;Futurama&quot; titled &quot;The Late Philip J. Fry,&quot; Bender, Farnsworth, and Fry travel to the future where they meet a society of small creatures who explain that humanity has diverged into two distinct groups through evolution. Upon returning five years later, the crew discovers that the small, intelligent creatures have been overrun and destroyed by the troglodytic &quot;Dumb-locks.&quot;

In the 2014 episode of &quot;Regular Show&quot; titled &quot;Journey to the Bottom of the Crash Pit,&quot; Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man and Hi-Five Ghost travel to their cave in search for a video camera, they find it in possession of the &quot;Carlocks&quot; instead of Morlocks, who are the first and last of the mighty underground race and refuse to give it back, forcing them to steal it and escape in a worn-out car. The Carlocks give chase to try and get the camera back, but the four manage to escape the hole. Skips&#x27; truck then dumped dirt into the hole, killing them for good.

===Comics===
In Marvel Comics, the Morlock name was used for a group of mutants that live in the sewers.

===Video games===
In &quot;Bookworm Adventures 2&quot;, Morlocks are instead named Troglocks and appear as enemies of the sixth book.

The Carlocks, instead of Morlocks, also appear in the online game &quot;Fist Punch 2&quot; as enemies.

In &quot;Deponia&quot;, Morlocks are instead named Fewlocks, but being referred to as Morlocks once and appear as enemies to the protagonists.

<text>In theoretical physics, an extremal black hole is a black hole with the minimum possible mass that is compatible with its charge and angular momentum.

The concept of an extremal black hole is theoretical and none have thus far been observed in nature. However, many theories are based on their existence.

In supersymmetric theories, extremal black holes are often supersymmetric: they are invariant under several supercharges. This is a consequence of the BPS bound. Such black holes are stable and emit no Hawking radiation. Their black hole entropy can be calculated in string theory.

It has been suggested by Sean Carroll that the entropy of an extremal black hole is equal to zero. Carroll explains the lack of entropy by creating a separate dimension for the black hole to exist within.

The Hawking radiation of extremal black holes is considered non-thermal (non-Planck distributed), with no associated temperature.

The hypothetical black hole electron is super-extremal (having more charge and angular momentum than a black hole of its mass &quot;should&quot;).

The third law of black hole thermodynamics should disallow such an extremal black hole and in 1986 a proof was published by Werner Israel. Nevertheless, recent work in a pair of preprints claims it contains an error and therefore extremal black hole are indeed possible. The third law of thermodynamics for black holes has always been controversial.

<text>In theoretical physics, a near-extremal black hole is a black hole which is not far from the minimal possible mass that can be compatible with the given charges and angular momentum. The calculations of the properties of near-extremal black holes are usually performed using perturbation theory around the extremal black hole; the expansion parameter is called non-extremality.

In supersymmetric theories, near-extremal black holes are often small perturbations of supersymmetric black holes. Such black holes have a very small Hawking temperature and consequently emit a small amount of Hawking radiation. Their black hole entropy can often be calculated in string theory, much like in the case of extremal black holes, at least to the first order in non-extremality.</text><links>

<doc id="681810" wikidata="Q2441748" url="?curid=681810" title="Running with Scissors (album)">
<text>Running with Scissors is the tenth studio album by the American parody musician &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, released on June 29, 1999. It was the fourth studio album self-produced by Yankovic, and his first album for Volcano Records after its acquisition of Scotti Brothers. The musical styles on the album are built around parodies and pastiches of pop and rock music of the late 1990s, largely targeting alternative rock and hip-hop. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;The Saga Begins&quot;, however, was a parody of the 1971 single &quot;American Pie&quot; by Don McLean, and it recounts the plot of the film &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;, which was released around the same time. None of the album&#x27;s singles charted domestically, although &quot;Pretty Fly for a Rabbi&quot;, a parody of &quot;Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)&quot; by the Offspring, charted at number 67 in Australia.

The album featured five parodies. Aside from the aforementioned &quot;The Saga Begins&quot; and &quot;Pretty Fly for a Rabbi&quot;, the album also contains lampoons of &quot;One Week&quot; by Barenaked Ladies, &quot;It&#x27;s All About the Benjamins&quot; by Puff Daddy, and &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; by Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies. The other half of the album is original material, featuring many &quot;style parodies&quot;, or musical imitations of existing artists. These style parodies include imitations of specific artists like Nine Inch Nails and the Rugburns, as well as imitations of different musical genres like zydeco, third-wave ska, and truck-driving country.

&quot;Running with Scissors&quot; was met with mostly positive reviews, with many critics praising &quot;The Saga Begins&quot;; some, however, felt that the album was rushed. The album peaked at number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;The Saga Begins&quot; went on to become one of Yankovic&#x27;s best-known singles, although it never charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Running with Scissors&quot; was Yankovic&#x27;s seventh Gold record in the United States, and went on to be certified Platinum for sales of over one million copies in the US. The album also was certified Gold in both Australia and Canada.

==Production==
===Recording===
In June 1997, Yankovic entered the studio to begin the first of the &quot;Running with Scissors&quot; sessions, which Yankovic produced himself. Recording with Yankovic were Jon &quot;Bermuda&quot; Schwartz on drums, Steve Jay on bass, and Jim West on guitar. The album was recorded in six sessions. The first session started on June 29, 1997, in which Yankovic recorded the theme song to his television show, &quot;The Weird Al Show&quot;. The second session, which occurred on October 7, 1998, produced the original song &quot;Germs&quot;, and eight days later, on October 15, Yankovic started the third session and recorded three more originals, &quot;Albuquerque&quot;, &quot;My Baby&#x27;s in Love with Eddie Vedder&quot;, and &quot;Truck Drivin&#x27; Song&quot;. The next day, the fourth session resulted in the song &quot;Your Horoscope for Today&quot;. On April 19 of the following year, Yankovic recorded four parodies during the fifth session, &quot;Pretty Fly for a Rabbi&quot;, &quot;Jerry Springer&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s All About the Pentiums&quot;, and &quot;Grapefruit Diet&quot;. The album&#x27;s sixth and final session occurred on April 20, and resulted in &quot;The Saga Begins&quot;, and the album&#x27;s polka medley, &quot;Polka Power!&quot;

===Originals===

The album includes &quot;The Weird Al Show Theme&quot;, which is the theme song to Yankovic&#x27;s short-lived television series. &quot;Germs&quot; is a style parody of industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails that tells of the narrator&#x27;s germophobia. &quot;Your Horoscope for Today&quot; is a style parody of third wave ska, which features Reel Big Fish members Tavis Werts on trumpet and Dan Regan on trombone, and has lyrics about ridiculous horoscopes. Yankovic attributes the lyrics&#x27; inspiration to the satirical newspaper &quot;The Onion&quot;. After Ophiuchus was touted by some papers as the &quot;13th zodiac sign&quot;, Yankovic released new lyrics on his Twitter for the sign. In January 2023 an animated music video was released for the song to promote &quot;The Illustrated Al&quot; graphic novel.

&quot;Albuquerque&quot;, an eleven-minute &quot;hard-driving rock narrative&quot;, is a style parody of the Rugburns, particularly the song &quot;Dick&#x27;s Automotive&quot;, and tells the fictional life of Yankovic and his various adventures in the town of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Yankovic originally wrote the song to &quot;annoy people for 12 minutes&quot;. He felt that it would be an &quot;odyssey&quot; for fans to successfully sit through it, and so it was placed at the album&#x27;s end. Instead, to Yankovic&#x27;s surprise, the song has become a fan favorite. &quot;My Baby&#x27;s in Love with Eddie Vedder&quot; is a style parody of zydeco about a man&#x27;s frustration that his girlfriend is obsessed with Eddie Vedder, the lead singer for the grunge band Pearl Jam. &quot;Truck Drivin&#x27; Song&quot;, a detailed account of a truck driver working while simultaneously worrying about their clothing and makeup, is a style parody of truck-driving country. While writing the song, Yankovic listened to C.W. McCall for inspiration.

===Parodies and polka===
The first parody recorded for the album was &quot;Pretty Fly for a Rabbi&quot;, a parody of the Offspring&#x27;s 1998 single &quot;Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)&quot;, about a hip rabbi.&quot; In order to accurately write the song, Yankovic consulted several of his Jewish friends as well as several English-to-Yiddish dictionaries. The song&#x27;s opening line – &quot;Veren zol fun dir a blintsa&quot; – is a Yiddish curse that roughly means &quot;May you turn into a blintz.&quot; Originally, Yankovic had wanted voice actress Mary Kay Bergman to sing the song as her &quot;South Park&quot; character Sheila Broflovski. However, due to legal restrictions, she was only able to say a few lines in the finished product. Yankovic then approached actress Fran Drescher to lend her voice to the song, but this was also unsuccessful. Finally, Yankovic was able to get actress Tress MacNeille – who had been featured in his 1983 parody &quot;Ricky&quot; – to appear in the song.

The second parody recorded for the album was &quot;Jerry Springer&quot;, a parody of Barenaked Ladies 1998 hit &quot;One Week&quot;. The song is about &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot;, hosted by the eponymous Jerry Springer. In preparation for the song, Yankovic watched &quot;a couple shows&quot; until he understood the &quot;basic formula&quot; for how the episodes unfolded. Originally, there were plans to shoot a video, and Springer was asked if he wanted to be in it. Springer was initially interested, but after hearing the song, he declined because he believed it was too &quot;negative&quot; towards his show. The third parody recorded for the album was &quot;It&#x27;s All About the Pentiums&quot;, a parody of the rock remix of the track &quot;It&#x27;s All About the Benjamins&quot; by Sean &quot;Puff Daddy&quot; Combs. Yankovic spoke to Combs personally on the phone to make sure that the parody would not emulate the 1996 Coolio incident. Due to time constraints, Yankovic was forced to write the song a few days before the entire album was slated to be mastered, as Yankovic had still been waiting for Combs&#x27; approval. By the time Combs responded to him, Yankovic was recording the last session for the album. To give him time to write the lyrics, Yankovic&#x27;s band recorded the music first. Yankovic noted that &quot;we were mixing the last few songs on the album by the time I finished writing the lyrics to &#x27;Pentiums&#x27;, and I wound up recording the lead vocals just a couple days before the album had to be mastered.&quot; The fourth parody recorded for the album was &quot;Grapefruit Diet&quot;, a pastiche of &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; by the Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies about an obese man going on such a diet. The song&#x27;s writer, Steve Perry, called the opportunity to be parodied &quot;an honor&quot; but noted that &quot;Why Weird Al is such an icon is a mystery to me though&quot;.

The final parody recorded for the album was &quot;The Saga Begins&quot;, which recounts the plot of &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; from the point of view of Obi-Wan Kenobi to the tune of the 1971 single &quot;American Pie&quot; by Don McLean. Yankovic, who often bases his albums around significant moments in pop culture, felt that the album should have a song centered on the release of &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;. Yankovic first considered writing his parody of &quot;Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)&quot; about the film and calling it &quot;Pretty Fly for a Jedi&quot;, but he quickly dismissed this idea; he wanted to parody a classic song to commemorate how important the new movie was considered. Yankovic then chose to write a parody of &quot;American Pie&quot; about the film. Because Yankovic wanted the song to be topical, he began writing the lyrics in December 1998, many months before the film was released, gleaning all of the information about the movie&#x27;s plot entirely from Internet spoilers. The song was completed two months before &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; was released to theaters; Yankovic had approached Lucasfilm about the prospect of an advanced screening to ensure that his lyrics were accurate, but the company declined. However, Yankovic later went to a charity screening, whose tickets cost US$500 each. As a result, Yankovic only had to change one line; &quot;He&#x27;s probably gonna marry her someday&quot; was originally &quot;I hear he&#x27;s gonna marry her someday&quot;. A video which Yankovic later jokingly dubbed &quot;&quot;Star Wars&quot; Unplugged&quot; was filmed for the song, after &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; premiered in theaters.

Much like Yankovic&#x27;s previous albums, &quot;Running with Scissors&quot; features a polka medley of then-current hit songs called &quot;Polka Power!&quot;. The song was later released as a promotional single in Germany, where Yankovic&#x27;s recording label felt a polka song might have more success. This was the second time that one of Yankovic&#x27;s polka medleys was released as a single; in 1985, Scotti Brothers Records released &quot;Hooked on Polkas&quot;, from the album &quot;Dare to Be Stupid&quot;, in Japan.

==Artwork and packaging==
For nearly 20 years, Yankovic had been known for his hairdo, glasses, and moustache. However, in early 1998, Yankovic grew out his hair, shaved his moustache and underwent LASIK eye surgery to correct his vision, thus making glasses no longer necessary. As such, &quot;Running with Scissors&quot; was his first album to feature his new look. On the cover, he is shown running on the track at Santa Monica City College, holding a pair of scissors in each hand—a literal depiction of the album&#x27;s title. The CD booklet contains the complete lyrics to all but one of the album&#x27;s songs; due to the length of the closing song &quot;Albuquerque&quot;, not all of its lyrics fit on the final page of the booklet. Instead of continuing with the &quot;Albuquerque&quot; lyrics, the end of the booklet breaks off mid-sentence and concludes with an apology from Yankovic, in which he states that there was no way he could have fit the rest of the song&#x27;s lyrics on the existing booklet and that he &quot;should have used a smaller font or a bigger piece of paper or something&quot;. Yankovic later released the complete lyrics on the &quot;Ask Al&quot; feature on his website, and had them printed in &quot;Weird Al: The Book&quot; (2012).

&quot;Running with Scissors&quot; is also the first of &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&#x27;s albums to feature multimedia content. After placing the CD in a CD-ROM drive, one can browse through the files and play a QuickTime movie file containing fourteen minutes of footage from the Disney Channel concert special &quot;&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic: (There&#x27;s No) Going Home&quot;.

==Promotion==
Following the release of &quot;Running with Scissors&quot;, Yankovic undertook a two-year-long tour called &quot;Touring with Scissors&quot;. Starting on July 19, 1999, Yankovic played over 200 shows across the United States and Canada. A live video recording of one of the shows, called &quot;&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic Live!&quot; was released later in the year. To promote the album, two promotional websites were launched for the singles &quot;It&#x27;s All About the Pentiums&quot; and &quot;The Saga Begins&quot;: &quot;thepentiums.com&quot; and &quot;sagabegins.com&quot;, respectively. Each site featured the respective song&#x27;s music video, as well as additional information, such as behind-the-scenes notes and lyrics.

==Critical reception==

The album was met with mostly positive reviews from critics. J.D. Considine of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album a &quot;B&quot; rating and felt that, while many comedians are unable to translate jokes onto CD, &quot;Yankovic&#x27;s jokes are eminently listenable.&quot; He concluded that &quot;compared with most comedy recordings these days, &quot;Running with Scissors&quot; is a cut above.&quot; Melissa Ruggieri of the &quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch&quot; graded the album a &quot;B+&quot;, writing, &quot;Now on his 10th album, the weird and wacky Al tackles gems such as Don McLean&#x27;s &#x27;American Pie&#x27;, The Offspring&#x27;s &#x27;Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)&#x27; and Barenaked Ladies&#x27; &#x27;One Week&#x27;. Most of the results are priceless.&quot; Warren Rhodes of the &quot;Anchorage Daily News&quot; named the album the fifth best release of 1999, writing that, &quot;Leaving his long-time label [Scotti Brothers] has inspired the parody king; even his originals are pretty good this time.&quot; He also wrote that &quot;the intellect&#x27;s still there, and his wide-ranging chameleon band has no equal.&quot; In &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, &quot;Running with Scissors&quot; was given 3.5 stars out of 5, which denoted that the album averaged between good and excellent. The book wrote that Yankovic&#x27;s &quot;nasal whine has never been put to more appropriate use than [on] &#x27;Pretty Fly for a Rabbi&#x27;.&quot;

Not all reviews were positive. Steve Huey of AllMusic gave the album two and a half stars out of five and called it &quot;a mixed bag&quot;. Huey felt that both &quot;The Saga Begins&quot; and &quot;Jerry Springer&quot; were clever parodies, whereas &quot;Pretty Fly for a Rabbi&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s All About the Pentiums&quot; were not &quot;quite up to his usual standards.&quot; Robert Johnson of the &quot;San Antonio Express-News&quot; was critical of the album, giving it one-and-a-half stars, noting that &quot;in his haste to stay up to the minute, [Yankovic] forgot to make [&#x27;The Saga Begins&#x27;] funny.&quot; He wrote that the album &quot;features recycled ideas (fat jokes, alt-rock hits redone as polkas), tunes that sound better than they play (&#x27;Pretty Fly for a Rabbi&#x27;) and weirdness for its own sake (the 11-minute &#x27;Albuquerque&#x27;).&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Running with Scissors&quot; was released on June 29, 1999. The album entered the Billboard 200 chart at number 35 on July 17, and went up to its peak position of 16 the following week. The album also charted on the Top Internet Albums, a first for Yankovic, entering at number 7, and eventually peaking at number 3. The album was consecutively certified both Gold and Platinum by Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of over 1,000,000 copies in the United States. , sales in the United States have exceeded 1,182,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

In late 2013, Yankovic sued his label, Volcano, and its parent company Sony for unpaid publishing royalties from several of his albums and singles, including &quot;Running with Scissors&quot;. Yankovic claimed thatdespite the album&#x27;s successhe never earned royalties from the record. The initial lawsuit was for $5 million; Yankovic won the lawsuit and was awarded an undisclosed sum of money from Sony.

<text>Alapalooza is the eighth studio album by the American parody musician &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, released in 1993. By the completion of his previous album, &quot;Off the Deep End&quot;, Yankovic had already written all of the original songs that he planned to use on his next release. This new album, which would eventually be titled &quot;Alapalooza&quot; in reference to the music festival Lollapalooza, consisted of seven original songs and five parodies. It produced three parody singles: &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, &quot;Bedrock Anthem&quot;, and &quot;Achy Breaky Song&quot;. &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; was a top five hit on the Canadian magazine &quot;The Record&quot;″s single chart.

Among the album&#x27;s original creations were &quot;Talk Soup&quot;, a tune originally intended to replace the theme song of the television show of the same name, and &quot;Harvey the Wonder Hamster&quot;, an oft-requested jingle from one of Yankovic&#x27;s Al TV specials. A music video compilation, entitled &quot;Alapalooza: the Videos&quot;, was released the following year and contained four videos, only two of which were from its eponymous album. One of the videos, the one for &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, was animated entirely in the style of claymation and received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video at the 37th Grammy Awards, losing to &quot;Love Is Strong&quot; from the Rolling Stones.

&quot;Alapalooza&quot; met with average to negative reception upon its release, with some critics commenting that the album seemed hurried and out of touch with contemporary music. The video offering received a similarly lukewarm response. Nonetheless, the album was certified &quot;gold&quot; in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America by the end of the year, peaking at number 46 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and went &quot;double platinum&quot; in Canada.

==Production==
===Background===
Yankovic&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;Off the Deep End&quot;, his best-selling album since 1984&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic in 3-D&quot;, had revived his career and displayed his &quot;credibility as an evolving artist&quot; after the commercial failures of his 1986 work &quot;Polka Party!&quot; and his feature film &quot;UHF&quot;. By the time production for &quot;Off the Deep End&quot; was nearing completion, Yankovic had already written all of the original songs that would be eventually included on &quot;Alapalooza&quot;. Fearing that his track &quot;I Was Only Kidding&quot; would be outdated by the time of his next album, he rearranged &quot;Off the Deep End&quot; to allow for the song to be released with the album, saving &quot;Waffle King&quot; for &quot;Alapalooza&quot;. Nevertheless, &quot;Waffle King&quot; was released as a B-side to &quot;Off the Deep End&quot;″s &quot;Smells Like Nirvana&quot; single, &quot;just in case there wasn&#x27;t going to be a next album&quot;.

Yankovic recorded all of the album&#x27;s original songs, except &quot;Talk Soup&quot; and &quot;Harvey the Wonder Hamster&quot;, by the end of 1992 and, in July 1993, recorded all of &quot;Alapalooza&quot;″s remaining tracks, aside from &quot;Livin&#x27; in the Fridge&quot;. Yankovic eventually decided to title his new album &quot;Alapalooza&quot;, a reference to the Lollapalooza music festival. The Yankovic dinosaur in the album&#x27;s booklet was designed by David Peters, who had worked previously with the singer on the &quot;Dare to Be Stupid&quot; video.

&quot;Alapalooza&quot; was released on October 5, 1993, in the United States. Globally, some versions included a notice distinguishing it from the official &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; film soundtrack, as the two cover designs were similar. The Japanese edition contained a bonus track of Yankovic singing &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; in Japanese. A music video compilation for the album, entitled &quot;Alapalooza: the Videos&quot;, was released in February 1994 and contained four videos, only two of which (&quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and &quot;Bedrock Anthem&quot;) were from &quot;Alapalooza&quot;.

===Originals===
&quot;Alapalooza&quot; contains seven original songs among its twelve tracks, although &quot;Young, Dumb &amp; Ugly&quot; and &quot;Frank&#x27;s 2000&quot; TV&quot; were meant to be stylistic parodies of AC/DC and the early work of R.E.M., respectively. For the former, Yankovic wanted to parody the heavy metal music genre while at the same time avoiding a repetition of what had already been done by Spinal Tap. He ended up disliking the final product because he sang it &quot;in a register that was really too high for [his] singing voice&quot;. The latter was a song about consumerism and modern electronics that described the neighborhood&#x27;s envy of the eponymous character&#x27;s new television.

The song &quot;Talk Soup&quot;, which is about a man who desires to go on television to tell the world about his strange life, was originally commissioned as a new theme for the E! Entertainment Television show of the same name. Although the producers approved the lyrics and enjoyed the result, they decided against using it. &quot;Waffle King&quot;, the track that had been intended for &quot;Off the Deep End&quot;, was written as &quot;a song about a guy who becomes incredibly famous for doing something kinda stupid, and then starts taking himself way too seriously&quot;. Yankovic included &quot;Harvey the Wonder Hamster&quot;, a short tune from one of his Al TV appearances, after receiving numerous requests to include it on an album.

===Parodies===

Yankovic&#x27;s first single from &quot;Alapalooza&quot; was &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, a parody of the Jimmy Webb song &quot;MacArthur Park&quot; that was first performed by Richard Harris in 1968. After hearing &quot;Lola&quot; by The Kinks on the radio and recalling how much he had enjoyed his previous pairing of a contemporary film with a classic song (1985&#x27;s &quot;Yoda&quot;), Yankovic came up with the idea for a tune based around the recently released &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; film. He received permission from Webb, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; author Michael Crichton, and director Steven Spielberg to produce the track. For the music video Yankovic collaborated with animators Mark Osborne and Scott Nordlund to produce a claymation feature that parodied scenes from the movie; the song itself was a comedic retelling of the film&#x27;s plot interspersed with the gripes about his visit to the park. The music video was directed by Osborne and Nordlund, while Yankovic came up with the original concept and ideas for some of the shots; Osborne said that the directors &quot;came up with about half the ideas in collaboration&quot; with Yankovic.

Having always wanted to write a tribute to &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, Yankovic next focused his energy on creating a song that he hoped would be current with the impending release of &quot;The Flintstones&quot; live action film in 1994. In order to collect sound bites and animation and &quot;re-familiarize&quot; himself with the characters, Yankovic watched over 100 episodes of the original show. A parody of both Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; &quot;Under the Bridge&quot; and &quot;Give It Away&quot;, the resulting song was a comedic tribute to the program. It ended up becoming the second single released from &quot;Alapalooza&quot;. Yankovic directed the video for the single, which featured scenes of band members playing the song in Bedrock dressed as characters from the show. In the third and final single, &quot;Achy Breaky Song&quot;, a parody of Billy Ray Cyrus&#x27; &quot;Achy Breaky Heart&quot;, Yankovic lists things he would rather experience than having to listen to the original track. The parody received radio play on country music stations in the United States. The proceeds from the track were donated to United Cerebral Palsy, as both Don Von Tress (the songwriter of &quot;Achy Breaky Heart&quot;) and Yankovic felt that the parody was &quot;a little bit [...] mean-spirited&quot;.

&quot;Livin&#x27; in the Fridge&quot;, a parody of Aerosmith&#x27;s &quot;Livin&#x27; on the Edge&quot; that discusses leftovers that have grown sentient in the refrigerator, was the last song to be recorded for the album. With a deadline looming, Yankovic sent requests to several artists to do parodies of their songs. He ultimately went with Aerosmith because they replied first. It was recorded a month after the rest of the tracks had been finalized and less than two months prior to the album&#x27;s release. The album includes a polka medley, a staple of Yankovic&#x27;s albums, called &quot;Bohemian Polka&quot;. Unlike previous medleys, which had featured portions of multiple songs, &quot;Bohemian Polka&quot; contains only one tune, Queen&#x27;s &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, and is a rearrangement of the entire song as a polka.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Critical response to &quot;Alapalooza&quot; ranged from average to negative. In &quot;(The New) Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, &quot;Alapalooza&quot; earned 2.5 stars out of 5, which ranked it somewhere between &quot;mediocre&quot; and &quot;good&quot;. Anthony of &quot;The Buffalo News&quot; gave the album three stars out of five, claiming that &quot;[o]nce again, Weird Al gets the last laugh on rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;. Barry Weber of AllMusic, on the other hand, criticized the album for failing to engage contemporary musical trends and said it &quot;sounds sloppy and mostly like a compilation of old B-sides&quot;. In reference to the album&#x27;s polka tune, Mark Jenkins of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that it &quot;doesn&#x27;t sound all that different&quot; from the original.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; felt that overall &quot;Alapalooza: the Videos&quot; was &quot;amusing&quot;, but referred to the claymation video for the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; as &quot;clever but toothless&quot;. The magazine gave the collection an overall grade of &quot;C&quot; and argued that Yankovic&#x27;s parodies did not satirize the original material, but instead transposed new elements on top of them. The video for &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video at the 37th Grammy Awards, but lost to the video for &quot;Love Is Strong&quot; by the Rolling Stones. Nonetheless, it received attention in animation festivals worldwide for its use of claymation effects.

===Commercial performance===
Released in October 1993, &quot;Alapalooza&quot; was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on December 23, 1993, representing sales of at least 500,000 units. The video compilation, released on February 1, 1994, went gold in the United States on August 14, 1995, representing sales of at least 50,000 units. In Canada the album went gold on November 16, 1993, platinum on January 31, 1994, and double platinum on February 12, 1998, representing sales of 50,000, 100,000, and 200,000 units respectively. The album peaked at number 46 on the United States&#x27; &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart on October 30, 1993, but produced no charting singles. In Canada, however, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; was a top five hit on &quot;The Record&quot;″s single chart. As of 2014, sales in the United States have exceeded 873,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

<text>The De Lisle carbine or De Lisle commando carbine was a British firearm used during World War II that was designed with an integrated silencer. That, combined with its use of subsonic ammunition, made it extremely quiet in action, possibly one of the quietest firearms ever made.

Few were manufactured as their use was limited to specialist military units.

==History==
The weapon was designed as a private venture by William Godfray de Lisle (known as Godfray), an engineer who worked for the Air Ministry. He made the first prototype in .22 calibre; this he tested by shooting rabbits and other small game for the table, near his home on the Berkshire Downs. In 1943, he approached Major Sir Malcolm Campbell of Combined Operations with his prototype; this was informally tested by firing the weapon into the River Thames from the roof of the New Adelphi building in London. This was chosen to discover if people in the street below heard it firing – they did not. A patent, number 579,168 was filed by De Lisle on May 8.

Combined Operations officials were impressed with the weapon and requested De Lisle produce a 9mm version. However, this was a failure. A third prototype, using the .45 ACP cartridge that was favoured by de Lisle, was much more successful. Tests of this showed the weapon had acceptable accuracy, produced no visible muzzle flash and was inaudible at a distance of .

Subsequent official firing tests recorded the De Lisle produced 85.5 dB of noise when fired. As a comparison, modern testing on a selection of handguns has shown that they produce 156 to 168 dB when firing without a silencer, and 117 to 140 dB when firing with one fitted. The De Lisle&#x27;s quietness was found to be comparable to the British Welrod pistol. However, the Welrod was useful only at very short range and used fabric and rubber components in the silencer that required replacement after a few shots. The De Lisle was able to fire hundreds of rounds before the silencer required disassembly for cleaning.

Combined Operations requested a small production run of De Lisle carbines and an initial batch of 17 were hand–made by Ford Dagenham, with Godfray De Lisle himself released from his Air Ministry duties so he could work full-time on the project; this initial batch was immediately put into combat use by the British Commandos. In 1944, the Sterling Armaments Company was given an order for 500 De Lisle carbines, but eventually only produced around 130. The Sterling version differed in a number of details from the earlier, Ford Dagenham model. Two prototypes of a further version, for airborne forces, were made. These had folding stocks, similar to those fitted to Sterling submachine guns.

De Lisle&#x27;s own .22 prototype was given to the National Army Museum in London, but it was subsequently lost and its present whereabouts are unknown.

===Combat use===
During the remainder of World War II, the De Lisle carbine was mainly used by the commandos, although they also saw some use by the Special Operations Executive (SOE). E. Michael Burke, the American former commander of a Jedburgh Team, stated that a De Lisle was used by them to assassinate two senior German officers in 1944.

A number of De Lisles were shipped to the Far East and used during the Burma Campaign to take out IJA soldiers on sentry duty. The De Lisle would also be used during the Korean War and the Malayan Emergency. 

US Army Special Forces - MACV-SOG used the weapon for many years in the Vietnam War, according to MSG Reinald &quot;Magnet Ass&quot; Pope in a 2024 interview. 

It has been claimed the weapon was also used by the Special Air Service during the Northern Irish Troubles.

==Design==
The De Lisle was based on a Short Magazine, Lee–Enfield Mk III* converted to .45 ACP. The receiver was modified, altering the bolt/bolthead, replacing the barrel with a modified Thompson submachine gun barrel (six grooves, RH twist), and using modified magazines from the M1911 pistol. The primary feature of the De Lisle was its extremely effective silencer, which made it very quiet in action. The silencer reduced the sound of the firearm discharging to such a degree that working the bolt (to chamber the next round) produced a louder noise than firing a cartridge.

The .45 ACP cartridge was selected as its muzzle velocity is subsonic for typical barrel lengths; consequently it would both retain its full lethality and not require custom-loaded ammunition to use with a silencer. Most rifle rounds are supersonic, where the bullet generates a &quot;sonic boom&quot; like any other object traveling at supersonic velocities, making them unsuitable for covert purposes. The Thompson gun barrel was &quot;ported&quot; (i.e. drilled with holes) to provide a controlled release of high pressure gas into the silencer that surrounds it before the bullet leaves the barrel. The silencer, in diameter, went all the way from the back of the barrel to well beyond the muzzle, making up half the overall length of the weapon. 

The silencer provided a very large volume to contain the gases produced by firing; this was one of the keys to its effectiveness. The MP5SD and AS Val are among other modern firearms that use the same concept.

The Lee–Enfield bolt was shortened to feed the .45 ACP rounds; the Lee–Enfield&#x27;s magazine set-up was replaced with a new assembly that held a modified M1911 magazine. The bolt operation offered an advantage in that the shooter could refrain from chambering the next round if absolute silence was required after firing; a semi-automatic weapon would not have offered this option as the cycling of the bolt coupled with rearward escaping propellant gas and the clink of the empty case against any hard surface would produce a noise with each shot. While the carbine was silent, it was not very accurate.

==Clones==
In 1970, MAC developed a 9 mm carbine called the &quot;Destroyer&quot;, inspired by the need for a silenced weapon to be used in special forces missions during the Vietnam War. The first models were based on the Destroyer carbine with five variants made.

===Modern reproductions===
A reproduction of the .45 caliber carbine is manufactured by the American company Valkyrie Arms based on original specifications. 

Special Interest Arms, for a time, produced limited quantities of a De Lisle replica which incorporated an improved magazine adapter system that allows the use of unmodified M1911 magazines and also fully supports the barrel chamber in the action, later discontinued.

On May 22, 2024, US Armament Manufacturing announced pre-orders for a reproduction of the De Lisle carbine.

<doc id="681814" wikidata="Q1649762" url="?curid=681814" title="Off the Deep End">
<text>Off the Deep End is the seventh studio album by the American parody musician &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, released in 1992. This album was the first album self-produced by Yankovic, after six albums with Rick Derringer. Recorded between June 1990 and January 1992, the album was a follow-up to the unsuccessful soundtrack to Yankovic&#x27;s 1989 film &quot;UHF&quot;. &quot;Off the Deep End&quot; and its lead single &quot;Smells Like Nirvana&quot; helped to revitalize Yankovic&#x27;s career after a lull following his last hit single, &quot;Fat&quot;, in 1988.

The musical styles on &quot;Off the Deep End&quot; are built around parodies and pastiches of pop and rock music of the late 1980s and early 1990s, including the newly arisen grunge movement. Half of the album is made up of parodies of Nirvana, MC Hammer, New Kids on the Block, Gerardo, and Milli Vanilli. The other half of the album is original material, featuring many &quot;style parodies&quot;, or musical imitations of existing artists. These style parodies include imitations of specific artists like the Beach Boys, James Taylor and Jan and Dean.

&quot;Off the Deep End&quot; was met with mostly positive reviews and peaked at number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album also produced one of Yankovic&#x27;s most famous singles, &quot;Smells Like Nirvana&quot;, a parody of Nirvana&#x27;s major rock hit &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;, which peaked at number 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. This song was Yankovic&#x27;s second-highest charting single, after &quot;Eat It&quot;, which was released in 1984. The cover also parodies the cover of Nirvana&#x27;s album, &quot;Nevermind&quot;. The original had a naked baby in the water with a dollar bill cast by a fishing rod; Yankovic&#x27;s replaced the baby with himself, and the dollar bill with a donut. &quot;Off the Deep End&quot; was Yankovic&#x27;s fourth Gold record, and went on to be certified Platinum for sales of over one million copies in the United States. In addition, the album was later nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Recording in 1993.

==Production==

===Background===
In 1989, Yankovic starred in a full-length feature film, co-written by himself and manager Jay Levey, and filmed in Tulsa, Oklahoma, called &quot;UHF&quot;. A satire of the television and film industries, also starring Michael Richards, Fran Drescher, and Victoria Jackson, it brought floundering studio Orion their highest test scores since the movie &quot;RoboCop&quot;. Although the movie made a little over six million domestically – out of a budget of five million – it was considered unsuccessful.

Yankovic also released a quasi-soundtrack for the film in late 1989, entitled &quot;UHF – Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and Other Stuff&quot;, which featured songs (and commercials) from the movie as well as new unrelated studio material from Yankovic. The album failed to be successful, charting at only 146 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and quickly falling off. After the release of &quot;UHF&quot;, Yankovic returned to the studio to record his follow-up album.

===Originals===
On June 6, 1990, recording for &quot;Off the Deep End&quot; officially began at Santa Monica Sound Recorders, in Santa Monica, California. The first recording session started with &quot;Airline Amy&quot;. These recording sessions marked the first time Yankovic self-produced his songs, after six albums with Rick Derringer. The producer and musician had parted ways because Derringer found that Yankovic would not listen to his input, and Yankovic came to realize that he could do most of the production work himself. Subsequent studio albums would be produced by Yankovic. In regards to this split, Yankovic said: &quot;We [i.e. Yankovic and his band] had a great run with Rick, he&#x27;s a terrific guybut I had become more and more of a control freak over the years, and I&#x27;d finally gotten to the point in my recording career where I felt that I could capably hold the reins all by myself.&quot; By late 1990 five originals—&quot;Airline Amy&quot;, &quot;Trigger Happy&quot;, &quot;When I Was Your Age&quot;, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Love Me Anymore&quot;, and &quot;Waffle King&quot;—were recorded.

&quot;You Don&#x27;t Love Me Anymore&quot; was one of the last original songs recorded during the 1990 sessions. The song is written as a soft acoustic ballad. However, the lyrics are of a—literally—destructive relationship between Yankovic and an unnamed girl. Although they were formerly in love, the &quot;flames died down&quot; and they are no longer passionate—in fact the girl hates Yankovic to such an extent that she repeatedly attempts to kill him. In 1992, when the album was finally released, Yankovic desired to release the song as a single. His record label, Scotti Brothers, allowed it under the stipulation that the music video be a parody of another music video. &quot;You Don&#x27;t Love Me Anymore&quot; was subsequently released to radio on June 19, 1992. While the song was an original composition, the video was a parody of &quot;More Than Words&quot; by Extreme. Yankovic later explained that when the song was released, many people erroneously believed it was a parody of &quot;More Than Words&quot;, and thus, Yankovic crafted the music video to be a parody of the song. The single received moderate radio attention, which surprised Yankovic, because he had always thought that radio stations &quot;usually just go for the parodies&quot;.

One of the original songs recorded in the 1990 sessions was &quot;Waffle King&quot;. However, when Yankovic resumed recording in 1992, he recorded a new original called &quot;I Was Only Kidding&quot;. Originally, &quot;Waffle King&quot; was supposed to appear on &quot;Off the Deep End&quot;. However, by the time the recording of the parodies for this album began, Al had written all the original songs that were to appear on his next album, &quot;Alapalooza&quot;. Because he was concerned that one of the jokes from the song &quot;I Was Only Kidding&quot; might be dated by the time his next album would finally be released—a line that references the movie &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;: &quot;I really love you... not!&quot;—Yankovic included &quot;I Was Only Kidding&quot; on &quot;Off the Deep End&quot; in place of &quot;Waffle King&quot;. &quot;Waffle King&quot; was instead used as the b-side of the &quot;Smells Like Nirvana&quot; single and would later resurface on &quot;Alapalooza&quot;.

The album also contains a hidden track at the end called &quot;Bite Me&quot;. The &quot;song&quot;, which consists of several seconds of loud music and Yankovic screaming, appears after 10 minutes of silence following &quot;You Don&#x27;t Love Me Anymore&quot;. According to Yankovic, the song was supposed to &quot;come on [...] and scare you to death&quot;. Later pressings of &quot;Off the Deep End&quot; by Volcano and pressings outside the USA took away the hidden track and silence. The track is a nod to Nirvana: pressings of &quot;Nevermind&quot; featured the hidden track &quot;Endless, Nameless&quot;.

===Parodies and polka===
After recording the first batch of originals in 1990, Yankovic focused his attention on parodies. By early 1991, only three parodies had been recorded. Two of them, the cookie-inspired New Kids on the Block parody &quot;The White Stuff&quot; and the television-centric MC Hammer parody &quot;I Can&#x27;t Watch This&quot;, were slated to be released as singles. In fact, several cartons of promo singles were pressed, but they were deleted from the record company&#x27;s catalogue at the last minute. These CDs were later discovered by Yankovic and his drummer, Jon &quot;Bermuda&quot; Schwartz, in a trash heap and have since become collector&#x27;s items. &quot;The Plumbing Song&quot;, a double parody of Milli Vanilli&#x27;s hit singles &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t Forget My Number&quot; and &quot;Blame It on the Rain&quot; was also recorded. In a 1992 interview with Dr. Demento, Yankovic said that he believed the parody to be &quot;kind of redundant&quot; at that point in time, given the lip-synching scandal that had effectively destroyed the band almost two years prior. In reference to this scandal, Yankovic also jokingly affirmed that he did indeed sing lead vocals on his parody.

Yankovic waited for almost two years for the next &quot;big thing&quot; to emerge. &quot;I don&#x27;t have any really good reason why it took so long other than the fact that I was waiting for Michael Jackson&#x27;s new album to come out,&quot; Yankovic explained. Unfortunately for Yankovic, the new album hit several snags. On November 26, 1991, Michael Jackson&#x27;s new album, &quot;Dangerous&quot; was released. After hearing the hit single &quot;Black or White&quot;, Yankovic approached Jackson about a potential parody entitled &quot;Snack All Night&quot;. Although Jackson was a big supporter of Yankovic&#x27;s work, he felt that a parody might damage the song&#x27;s message. Jackson told Yankovic that he could, if he wanted to, parody another song off his album, but just not &quot;Black or White&quot;.

Yankovic soon turned his attention in another direction. Guns N&#x27; Roses had just released a version of Wings&#x27;s 1970s hit &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;. Yankovic approached Paul McCartney, leader of Wings, about a parody idea entitled &quot;Chicken Pot Pie&quot;. Although McCartney was a supporter of Yankovic&#x27;s work and he wanted to give Yankovic the chance to parody one of his songs, he begrudgingly turned him down due to the fact that, as a vegetarian, he could not condone the eating of animal flesh. Yankovic, a fellow vegetarian, has stated that he respects McCartney&#x27;s decision.

It was around this time that Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot; was making waves in the rock and pop scene. As the popularity of 1980s pop gave way to grunge, Yankovic decided it was time to record a parody of the Seattle-based band&#x27;s huge hit single &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;. Yankovic later said, &quot;I wanted to make sure that when I came back after that long hiatus, it was with something strong, and it wasn&#x27;t until Nirvana that I felt I had a real contender.&quot; To secure permission for the parody, Yankovic wanted to approve it with Kurt Cobain. After learning that Nirvana was to perform on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, Yankovic called up his &quot;UHF&quot; co-star, Victoria Jackson, who was, at the time, a regular cast member on the show. Jackson got Cobain on the phone so that Yankovic could make his request. Cobain agreed, although he asked if the new parody was &quot;going to be a song about food&quot;. Yankovic reassured him that it would actually be about how &quot;no one can understand [the] lyrics&quot; to the original, which Cobain thought was funny. After receiving permission, Yankovic wrote and recorded &quot;Smells Like Nirvana&quot; on January 27, 1992.

After &quot;Smells Like Nirvana&quot;, Yankovic recorded &quot;Taco Grande&quot;, a Mexican food-themed parody of Gerardo&#x27;s &quot;Rico Suave&quot;. The latter features a cameo appearance from comedian Cheech Marin. Originally, Yankovic had wanted Marin to rap in Spanish, but it turned out that Marin knew only some basic Spanish. However, a bilingual secretary translated what Yankovic wanted him to say from English to Spanish and Marin read the resulting rap phonetically. One of the last songs to be recorded was the obligatory polka medley, &quot;Polka Your Eyes Out&quot;. Yankovic had already performed the medley at Dr. Demento&#x27;s 20th Anniversary Special on Comedy Central before the album had been released.

==Artwork==
The cover for &quot;Off the Deep End&quot; parodies the famous cover of Nirvana&#x27;s album &quot;Nevermind&quot;, which depicts an infant in the deep end of a pool chasing after a dollar bill on a fishhook. The &quot;Off the Deep End&quot; cover shows Yankovic in the baby&#x27;s place apparently swimming to catch a doughnut on a string. While the Nirvana cover has a fully nude baby, Yankovic instead wore a bathing suit in a way that his body position hid it; he later jokingly noted, &quot;I never really anticipated going full-frontal on any of my album covers.&quot; The CD, liner notes, and artwork continue the parody of Nirvana&#x27;s album, borrowing the same blue, wave-light graphics from the printed surface of &quot;Nevermind&quot;.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===

Critical response to &quot;Off the Deep End&quot; was generally positive. Many critics praised not only Yankovic&#x27;s parodies, but also his originals. Barry Weber, of AllMusic, wrote, &quot;In addition to re-establishing his satirical craftsmanship, Deep End showcases some of Yankovic&#x27;s best originals ever; &quot;Trigger Happy,&quot; &quot;When I Was Your Age,&quot; and &quot;You Don&#x27;t Love Me Anymore&quot; prove to be the album&#x27;s greatest songs.&quot; Christopher Thelen, of the Daily Vault, wrote, &quot;In fact, it&#x27;s strange to admit, but the originals on Off The Deep End actually are, at times, stronger than the parodies.&quot; &quot;In The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, &quot;Off the Deep End&quot; was awarded 3.5 stars out of 5, denoting that the album averaged between good and excellent. Not all reviews were so positive, however. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reviewer David Browne noted that the video for &quot;Off the Deep End&quot;″ lead single &quot;Smells Like Nirvana&quot; was &quot;an old-fashioned laugh riot&quot;, but that half of Yankovic&#x27;s humor was merely visual, meaning that the songs without videos were not as funny.

The music video for &quot;Smells Like Nirvana&quot; achieved similar praise. &quot;Spy Magazine&quot; named it the &quot;Video of the Year&quot; in 1993, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it as #68 on their list of the Top 100 Videos of All Time, and it was nominated for the MTV Video Music Award for Best Male Performance in 1992.

At the 35th Annual Grammy Awards in 1993, &quot;Off the Deep End&quot; was nominated for the Best Comedy Album. However, the album lost to Peter Schickele&#x27;s &quot;Music for an Awful Lot of Winds and Percussion&quot;.

===Commercial performance===
&quot;Off the Deep End&quot; was released April 1992, and was subsequently named the Best Selling Comedy Recording of the year by National Association of Recording Merchandisers (NARM). &quot;Off the Deep End&quot; was certified gold. On January 25, 2006, the album was certified platinum. The album&#x27;s lead-off single, &quot;Smells Like Nirvana&quot; was a hit on the Billboard Hot 100, charting at number 35. It also charted on Hot 100 Singles Sales at number 12 and the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Tracks chart at number 35. Both the album and hit single helped propel Yankovic into the 1990s. As of 2014, sales in the United States have exceeded 1,057,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

<text>In archaeology and anthropology, the term excarnation (also known as defleshing) refers to the practice of removing the flesh and organs of the dead before burial. Excarnation may be achieved through natural means, such as leaving a dead body exposed to the elements or for animals to scavenge; or by butchering the corpse by hand. Following excarnation, some societies retrieved the excarnated bones for burial.
Excarnation has been practiced throughout the world for hundreds of thousands of years. The earliest archaeological evidence of excarnation is from the Awash River Valley in Ethiopia, 160,000 years ago. Examples of excarnation include &quot;sky burials&quot; in parts of Asia, the Zoroastrian &quot;Tower of Silence&quot;, and Native American &quot;tree burials&quot;. Excarnation is practiced for a variety of spiritual and practical reasons, including the Tibetian spiritual belief that excarnation is the most generous form of burial and the Comanche practical concern that in the winter the ground is too hard for an underground burial. Excarnation sites are identifiable in the archaeological record by a concentration of smaller bones (like fingers or toes), which would be the bones that would be the easiest to fall off the body, and that would not be noticed by practitioners of excarnation.

== Methodology ==

=== Identification of excarnation ===
From the pattern of marks on some human bones at prehistoric sites, researchers have inferred that members of the community removed the flesh from the bones as part of its burial practices.

Since metatarsals, finger bones and toe bones are very small, they would easily fall through gaps in a woven structure or roll off the side during this removal. Thus a site where only small bones are found is suggestive of ritual excarnation.

=== Distinguishing excarnation from cannibalism ===
Archaeologists seeking to study the practice of ritual excarnation in the archeological record must differentiate between the removal of flesh as a burial practice, and as a precursor to cannibalism. When human bones exhibiting signs of flesh removal are discovered in the fossil record, a variety of criteria can be used to distinguish between the two. One common approach is to compare the tool marks and other cuts on the bones with butchered animal bones from the same site, with the assumption that cannibalized humans would have been prepared like any other meat, whereas excarnated bodies would be prepared differently. Cannibalized bones, in contrast to excarnated bones, may also exhibit telltale signs such as human tooth marks, broken long bones (to facilitate marrow extraction), and signs of cooking, such as &quot;pot polishing&quot;. Pot polishing refers to the smoothing and beveling that is observed in bones that have come into contact with the abrasive inner surface of a cooking vessel.

== By region ==

=== Africa ===

==== Ethiopia ====
160,000 years ago, &quot;Homo sapiens idaltu&quot; in the Awash River Valley (near present-day Herto village, Ethiopia) practiced excarnation.

=== Asia ===

==== India ====
The Parsis in Mumbai maintain a hilltop reserve, the Doongerwadi forest, in Malabar Hill with several Towers of Silence. Due to a decline in vultures in India (due to changes in animal husbandry practices) the traditional excarnation practice has faced pressure to evolve while still serving the same purpose, so the trustees of the reserve introduced solar concentrators at the towers. Other scavenger birds play a part but are not as efficient as vultures.

==== Tibet ====

Practices making use of natural processes for excarnation include Tibetan sky burials. Archaeologists believe that in this practice, people typically left the body exposed on a woven litter or altar. Following excarnation, the litter with its remains would be removed from the site.

==== Japan ====
In modern Japan, where cremation is predominant, it is common for close relatives of the deceased to transfer, using special chopsticks, the remaining bones from the ashes to a special jar in which they will be interred. However, in ancient Japanese society, prior to the introduction of Buddhism and the funerary practice of cremation, the corpse was exposed in a manner very similar to the Tibetan sky burial.

==== Pakistan ====
The Kalash people of Pakistan until recently (mid 1980s) practiced above ground burial in large wooden coffins called Bahg&#x27;a where the dead were laid with all their best belongings in cemeteries called Madokjal or place of many coffins. This tradition had been dying off with the last being the burial of a shaman in 1985, until the burial in 2016 of Batakeen of Anish village Bumburet.

==== Indonesia ====
The Bali Aga people of Trunyan village on Lake Batur in Bali practice customs found nowhere else on the island. These are the mountain Balinese, and they practice Animistic traditions that predate the arrival of Hinduism in Bali. The burial custom here is for the bodies to be laid on the ground and left to decompose, with a cloth cover or a bamboo cage. Once the decomposition is complete, the bones are placed on a stair shaped altar 500 feet to the north. A large banyan tree known as &quot;taru menyan&quot; (literally translated as &quot;nice smelling tree&quot;) is thought to take away bad smells.

=== Pacific ===

==== Hawaii ====
Pre-contact Hawaiians ritually defleshed the bones of high-ranking nobles (&quot;ali&#x27;i&quot;) so that they could be interred in reliquaries for later veneration. The remains of Captain Cook, who the Hawaiians had believed to be the god Lono, were treated this way after his death.

==== New Zealand ====
The Moriori people of the Chatham Islands placed their dead in a sitting position in the sand dunes looking out to sea; others were strapped to young trees in the forest. In time, the tree grew into and through the bones, making them one.

=== North America ===

==== Great Plains ====

Air burials (also known as tree burials) are a form of secondary burial, where a body is placed above ground either in a tree or on scaffolding. After an extended period of time (months to years) the remains are excarnated and buried underground. Air burials were practiced throughout the Great Plains by many different societies, including the Comanche, the Blackfeet, the Sioux, the Dakota, the Cheyenne, the Mandans, and the Crow. Air burials were practiced for both spiritual and practical reasons. Some tribes, like the Sioux and the Lakota, believed that elevating remains would better facilitate a spirit&#x27;s journey outside of their body. Additionally, elevating remains protected the bodies from being eaten by wolves and allowed a way to manage disease when burial was not possible, like in the winter when the ground was too hard. Lastly, some nomadic groups had specific burial grounds that they only visited once a year. These groups used air burial to care for the dead while waiting to return to their burial grounds.

Due to the temporary nature of air burials and because scaffoldings were made out of perishable materials, like wood, air burials leave behind little archaeological evidence. Thus much of the evidence of air burials come from ethnographic sources. However, some archaeological sites have been discovered where archaeologists believe excarnation occurred as remains were transfer from the primary air burial to their final resting place or to a secondary air burials site. These sites are identifiable by a concentration of smaller bones (like fingers or toes), which would be the bones that would be the easiest to fall off the body, and that would not be noticed by practitioners of excarnation.

After colonization, the U.S. government made air burial illegal, as it conflicted with the nation&#x27;s Christian ideals. However, in recent years, air burial has been allowed on reservation, leading to a small number of people returning to the practice of air burial.

==== Pacific Northwest ====
Canoe burials were a primary form of burial among the Chinookan-speaking tribes of the Columbia River. Bodies would be wrapped in blankets and placed inside a canoe with personal items. Wealthier families would sometimes top the burial canoe with a second, larger canoe to keep out the rain. The canoe(s) would then be placed in a tree.

In 1830, Chinook chief Comcomly died and was buried via canoe burial at a family burial ground.

=== Europe ===
==== Great Britain and Ireland ====
There is evidence of excarnation in Great Britain and Ireland during the Neolithic, whereby bodies would be left to decompose in an open-air mortuary enclosure, on an excarnation platform, or in a sealed cave, before the bones were deposited elsewhere.

==== Italy ====
Neolithic farmers living in Tavoliere, Italy, over 7000 years ago, practiced ritual defleshing of the dead. Light cut marks suggest that the bones were defleshed up to a year after death. The bones were deposited in Scaloria Cave and, when excavated, were mixed with animal bones, broken pottery and stone tools.

==== Other examples ====
In Europe during the Middle Ages and early modern period, defleshing was a mortuary procedure used mainly to prepare human remains for transport over long distances. The practice was used almost exclusively for nobility. The practice was known as &quot;mos teutonicus&quot;, or active excarnation. The bodies were broken down differently than solely defleshing, as they were cut up and boiled in either wine, water, or vinegar. The practice involved the removal of skin, muscles, and organs from a body, leaving only the bones. In this procedure, the head, arms, and legs were detached from the body. The process often left telltale cuts on the bones. Pope Boniface VIII banned in the practice in a papal bull in 1299.

One notable example of a person who underwent excarnation following death was Christopher Columbus. The American Revolutionary War general, Anthony Wayne, also underwent a form of excarnation.

King Louis IX of France is said to have been defleshed by boiling his corpse until the flesh separated from the bones. This was intended to preserve his bones, to avoid decay of the remains during their return to France from the Eighth Crusade, and to provide relics.

<doc id="681819" wikidata="Q202923" url="?curid=681819" title="Michael Bishop, Baron Glendonbrook">
<text>Michael David Bishop, Baron Glendonbrook (born 10 February 1942) is a British-Australian businessman and life peer who rose to prominence as owner of the airline BMI. He sold his stake in the airline to Lufthansa on 1 July 2009 and () had an estimated personal fortune of £280 million. He was one of the UK&#x27;s first openly gay senior executives.

==Early life==
Michael Bishop was born in Bowdon, Cheshire. The son of a factory boss, he was given a pleasure flight at the age of six. In 1949 his parents took him on an Aer Lingus flight to Dublin in search of chocolate, a rarity during post-war rationing.

Educated at the independent Mill Hill School in north London, he enjoyed flying and as a result took a series of school holiday jobs with an aerial photographer.

==British Midland==
In 1963, Bishop joined the ground handling operation of Manchester-based Mercury Airlines, a schedule and charter airline, which was taken over by British Midland Airways (later re-branded as BMI) in October 1964. Bishop joined British Midland, and rose to become General Manager of the airline in 1969 and managing director in 1972.

In 1978, the London-based Minster Assets investment group, which owned British Midland, decided to sell its stake. With the help of an entrepreneurial Californian dentist, Bishop raised £2.5 million to lead a management buyout, and was subsequently appointed chairman. He later said: &quot;I had to borrow the money from an American citizen. Most venture capitalists want a return of 40% to make up for all their other failures, and they want an exit strategy.&quot; From 1969 he was the key driving force behind the steady growth of the airline, which held 11% of the landing and take-off slots at London Heathrow Airport, second only to British Airways, and had a route network spanning Europe, North America, Asia and Africa.

Bishop formerly held a controlling 50% + 1 share stake of BMI, with German airline Lufthansa holding 30% minus 1 share, and SAS Airlines a further 20%. In October 2008, under a deal agreed in 1999 as part of the package for BMI to join the Star Alliance, Bishop agreed to sell his 50% stake to Lufthansa for an undisclosed sum, though reports suggested it was about £318m. BDLH (Lufthansa&#x27;s holding vehicle) acquired Bishop&#x27;s share on 1 July 2009, assuming full control of the company.

==Honours and appointments==
Between 1991 and 1993, Bishop was deputy chairman of Channel 4 television, becoming chairman from 1993 to 1997. He was also a board member at Sir Nigel Rudd&#x27;s Williams plc., and deputy chairman at Airtours.

In 1986, he was appointed CBE, and in 1991 he was knighted. The University of Leicester awarded him an honorary Doctor of Law (LL.D) degree on 12 July 2007.

In an annual survey by &quot;The Independent&quot; of the UK&#x27;s most influential gay men and women, Bishop was ranked as number 5 in 2005 and number 6 in 2006.

In February 2011, Bishop was created a life peer as Baron Glendonbrook, of Bowdon in the County of Cheshire, and was introduced in the House of Lords the next month, where he sits as a Conservative.

Bishop was appointed Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in the 2023 Australia Day Honours for &quot;significant service to the not-for-profit sector through philanthropic support&quot;.

==Arms==
==Personal life==
Bishop is openly gay and, since 2008, has spoken out publicly about gay rights and success in the workplace. He is often referred to as &quot;dapper&quot; by the press, to note his keen sense of elegance.

He has been a member of the Conservative Party since the age of 17. He is chairman of the Board of Trustees of the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company due to his personal financial sponsorship.

Bishop lives in London and at Bruern Abbey, West Oxfordshire. Since purchasing the 18th-century country house on the Bruern site in 2013, he has completely refurbished it, installing a &quot;large and impressive cantilever stone staircase and twenty-five kilometres of data cabling&quot; and an underground car park.

Bishop is a member of the Lord Lyon Society.

<doc id="681822" wikidata="Q1776118" url="?curid=681822" title="UHF – Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and Other Stuff">
<text>UHF – Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and Other Stuff is the sixth studio album and soundtrack album by the American parody musician &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, released on July 18, 1989. The album is the final of Yankovic&#x27;s to be produced by former McCoys guitarist Rick Derringer. Recorded between December 1988 and May 1989, the album served as the official soundtrack to the 1989 film of the same name, although the original score by John Du Prez is omitted. The album&#x27;s lead single was the titular &quot;UHF&quot;, although it was not a hit and did not chart.

The music on &quot;UHF&quot; is built around pastiches of rock, rap, and pop music of the late 1980s, featuring parodies of songs by Dire Straits, Tone Lōc, Fine Young Cannibals, and R.E.M. The album also features many &quot;style parodies&quot;, or musical imitations of existing artists. These style parodies include imitations of specific artists like Harry Chapin, as well as various musical genres like blues. The album also features many music cuts from the film as well as some of the commercials, like &quot;Spatula City&quot;, and other parody bits, like &quot;Gandhi II&quot;.

Peaking at No. 146 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the album was not a commercial success, and received lukewarm critical attention. The &quot;UHF&quot; soundtrack is one of Yankovic&#x27;s few studio albums not certified either Gold or Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the United States. It would also be Yankovic&#x27;s last studio album to be released on vinyl record in the U.S. until 2011&#x27;s &quot;Alpocalypse&quot;.

==Production==
===Background and recording===
Following the success of Yankovic&#x27;s 1988 album &quot;Even Worse&quot;, which featured the Michael Jackson spoof &quot;Fat&quot;, Yankovic pitched a screenplay co-written by his manager Jay Levey called &quot;UHF&quot; (internationally known as &quot;The Vidiot from UHF&quot;) to Orion Pictures. A satire of the television and film industries, the film starred Yankovic as George Newman, a man who stumbles into managing a low-budget UHF television station and finds success with his eclectic programming choices. Also starring Michael Richards, Fran Drescher, and Victoria Jackson, it brought the floundering studio Orion their highest test scores since the movie &quot;RoboCop&quot;. Although the movie made slightly over US$6 million domestically—out of a budget of $5 million—it was considered unsuccessful.

In December 1988, Yankovic returned to the studio to record the soundtrack to his feature film. Once again, former McCoys guitarist Rick Derringer was brought in to produce the album. This would be Derringer&#x27;s last production credit for Yankovic. The producer and musician eventually parted ways because Derringer found that Yankovic would not listen to his input, and Yankovic came to realize that he could do most of the production work himself. Subsequent studio albums would be produced by Yankovic. Recording with Yankovic were Jon &quot;Bermuda&quot; Schwartz on drums, Steve Jay on bass, and Jim West on guitar. The album was recorded in six different sessions at both Santa Monica Sound Records in Santa Monica, California and Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles. During the first session, the song &quot;Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies&quot; was recorded. The second session yielded the titular &quot;UHF&quot; and &quot;Let Me Be Your Hog&quot;. During the third session, Yankovic recorded &quot;Stanley Spadowski&#x27;s Theme&quot;—which would later be renamed &quot;Fun Zone&quot;—as well as the skit &quot;Gandhi II&quot;. Only one song was recorded during the fourth sessions, the skit &quot;Spatula City&quot;. The fifth recording session resulted in five songs: &quot;Spam&quot;, &quot;Attack of the Radioactive Hamsters From a Planet Near Mars&quot;, &quot;Hot Rocks Polka&quot;, &quot;Biggest Ball of Twine in Minnesota&quot;, and &quot;Generic Blues&quot;. The sixth and final session produced the two parodies &quot;Isle Thing&quot; and &quot;She Drives Like Crazy&quot;.

===Originals===
On February 24, 1989, Yankovic recorded the first original song for the album, &quot;Let Me Be Your Hog&quot;. The song is a short rock snippet that is heard in the movie as Newman&#x27;s uncle Harvey (Stanley Brock) lounges in his pool. Originally, Yankovic had wanted to use the 1974 single &quot;Kung Fu Fighting&quot; by Carl Douglas for the scene, but he could not obtain the rights for the song, and thus &quot;Let Me Be Your Hog&quot; was recorded. Yankovic then recorded the theme from his movie, the titular &quot;UHF&quot;, written in the style of a TV station&#x27;s large promotional campaign. On February 25, Yankovic recorded the instrumental &quot;Fun Zone&quot;, also known as &quot;Stanley Spadowski&#x27;s Theme&quot;. Originally written four years earlier for a failed &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; replacement titled &quot;Welcome to the Fun Zone&quot;, this song is played at the beginning of every Weird Al concert.

Three months later, on May 24, 1989, Yankovic recorded three more originals. The first of these, &quot;Attack of the Radioactive Hamsters from a Planet Near Mars&quot;, is a rock song about a number of mutated hamsters terrorizing Earth. The second original song, &quot;The Biggest Ball of Twine in Minnesota&quot;, is a folk ballad about a family road trip to a tourist location in Minnesota. Musically, the song was inspired both by the book &quot;Roadside America&quot;, which &quot;featured all the campy places around the country that one could possibly visit&quot;, as well as the music of Harry Chapin and Gordon Lightfoot, which Yankovic described as &quot;storyteller songs, [with] sprawling narratives&quot;. The final original song recorded for the album was &quot;Generic Blues&quot;, Yankovic&#x27;s attempt to write &quot;the ultimate blues song&quot;. After the release of the song, B.B. King listed it as one of his top ten favorite blues songs.

&quot;UHF – Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and Other Stuff&quot; is also notable in that it was Yankovic&#x27;s first and only studio album to dabble in the art of skits. The first of these segments is called &quot;Gandhi II&quot;, which re-imagines Mahatma Gandhi as the hero of a blaxploitation-style sequel to the film &quot;Gandhi&quot;, spoofing both the theme and promos for the film &quot;Shaft&quot;. The second skit is called &quot;Spatula City&quot; and is an advertisement for a spatula outlet store. These short segments were used in the film as commercials; other commercial segments, such as &quot;Plots &#x27;R Us&quot; and &quot;Conan the Librarian&quot;, were not used on the album.

===Parodies and polka===
On December 20, 1988, Yankovic recorded &quot;Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies&quot;. The song features the lyrics of &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; theme song altered slightly and set to the tune of &quot;Money for Nothing&quot;. The song appears in its entirety within &quot;UHF&quot; as a computer-animated dream sequence, framed as if it were part of a music video. As part of his terms that allowed Yankovic to record this parody, Dire Straits lead singer and guitarist and &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; songwriter Mark Knopfler insisted that he be allowed to play the guitar featured in the parody. As a result, both he and Guy Fletcher—Dire Straits&#x27; keyboardist—recorded their parts on guitar and synthesizer respectively. According to Yankovic, his guitarist Jim West had practiced the song for weeks, and, as a result could recreate the original; Knopfler, on the other hand, had been playing the song for years and was much more relaxed with his playing. As a result, West&#x27;s version sounded more like the original version, although Knopfler&#x27;s track was the one used. Yankovic revealed in the DVD commentary for &quot;UHF&quot; that the concept &quot;Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies&quot; was originally a parody of Prince&#x27;s 1984 hit &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Crazy&quot;. Prince, however, refused, and was unreceptive to any parody ideas Yankovic ever presented him with. The fractured titled &quot;Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies&quot; is a result of Dire Straits&#x27; lawyers insisting that &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; remain in the parody&#x27;s title. Yankovic was unhappy with the title and stated that he would rather have had the title be either &quot;Money for Nothing for the Beverly Hillbillies&quot; or &quot;Beverly Hillbillies for Nothing&quot;. The legal title for the song features an asterisk after the word &quot;Hillbillies&quot;, although it is often printed without the marking.

On May 24, 1989, Yankovic started recording the second parody for the album, &quot;Spam&quot;. The song, a play on R.E.M.&#x27;s hit &quot;Stand&quot;, is an ode to the canned luncheon meat Spam. Yankovic noted that it was &quot;fun to pick [apart the song] and figure out some of those almost subliminal parts—parts that would fade in and out, little bell sounds, things you don&#x27;t really hear on first listening.&quot; On May 25, 1989, Yankovic recorded &quot;Isle Thing&quot;, a parody of &quot;Wild Thing&quot; by Tone Lōc, about a woman who introduces the narrator to the television show &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;. Notably, the song is Yankovic&#x27;s first rap parody; an earlier rap, &quot;Twister&quot;, is a Beastie Boys style spoof, but not a direct parody. Another Tone Lōc hit, &quot;Funky Cold Medina&quot;, is referenced in the lyrics: &quot;Ginger and Mary Ann coulda used some funky cold medina&quot;. The final parody, &quot;She Drives Like Crazy&quot;—recorded the same day as &quot;Isle Thing&quot;—is a spoof of Fine Young Cannibals&#x27; 1988 single &quot;She Drives Me Crazy&quot;. Lyrically, the song is about a man who fears his girlfriend&#x27;s crazy driving habits.

Like many of Yankovic&#x27;s previous albums, &quot;UHF – Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and Other Stuff&quot; features a polka medley of hit songs. &quot;The Hot Rocks Polka&quot; contains songs written and made popular by the Rolling Stones.

===Music videos===

Both &quot;Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies&quot; and &quot;UHF&quot; received stand-alone music videos. The &quot;Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies&quot; video was reused for the movie, described above. The &quot;UHF&quot; video featured Yankovic and his band parodying other musicians and specific music videos, interspersed with clips from the movie. Artists and videos parodied included Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot;, ZZ Top&#x27;s &quot;Legs&quot;, the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Your Mother Should Know&quot;, George Michael&#x27;s &quot;Faith&quot;, Robert Palmer&#x27;s &quot;Addicted to Love&quot;, Prince&#x27;s &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; and &quot;1999&quot;, Talking Heads&#x27; &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot; and &quot;Girlfriend Is Better&quot;, Peter Gabriel&#x27;s &quot;Sledgehammer&quot;, Billy Idol&#x27;s &quot;White Wedding&quot; and &quot;Rebel Yell&quot;, INXS&#x27;s &quot;Mediate&quot;, and Randy Newman&#x27;s &quot;I Love L.A.&quot;.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

Due to the short stint of &quot;UHF&quot; in theaters, its soundtrack got &quot;lost in the shuffle&quot; and did not receive much of a critical response. However, from the few reviews it did receive, the album received a mixed response. Jacob Lunders of AllMusic awarded the album three stars out of five and called it a &quot;guilty pleasure&quot;. Lunders noted that the album &quot;endures artistically as a transitional album between his &#x27;80s heyday and the imminent artistic makeover revealed on 1992&#x27;s &quot;Off the Deep End&quot;&quot;. He ultimately concluded that the album is something that only &quot;moderate [to] genuine&quot; fans may want, but that it is &quot;nearly as accessible&quot; as many of his compilation albums. &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; awarded the album three stars out of five, denoting a &quot;good&quot; album. A &quot;TV Guide&quot; critic, in a review of the movie, wrote that &quot;the quality of [the movie&#x27;s] parodies&quot; are &quot;inconsistent, with the movie and music takeoffs being obvious and out of date.&quot;

===Commercial performance===
&quot;UHF – Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and Other Stuff&quot; was released July 18, 1989. After it was released, the album peaked at number 146 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Much like &quot;Polka Party!&quot; (1986), the album was considered a major commercial disappointment for the comedian; the album is his second-lowest charting album after &quot;Polka Party!&quot;. The &quot;UHF&quot; soundtrack is one of only a few of Yankovic&#x27;s studio albums that is not certified either Gold or Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the United States. The others include &quot;Polka Party!&quot; and &quot;Poodle Hat&quot; (2003). &quot;UHF&quot; was Yankovic&#x27;s last studio album to be released in the US on vinyl record until 2011&#x27;s &quot;Alpocalypse&quot;.

<text>Even Worse is the fifth studio album by the American parody musician &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, released on April 12, 1988. The album was produced by former The McCoys guitarist Rick Derringer. Recorded between November 1987 and February 1988, this album helped to revitalize Yankovic&#x27;s career after the critical and commercial failure of his previous album &quot;Polka Party!&quot; (1986).

The music on &quot;Even Worse&quot; is built around parodies and pastiches of pop and rock music of the late 1980s. Half of the album is made up of parodies, featuring jabs at Michael Jackson, George Harrison, Tiffany, Los Lobos, and Billy Idol. The other half is original material, featuring several &quot;style parodies&quot; or musical imitations that emulate existing artists. These style parodies include imitations of specific artists such as Oingo Boingo, Beastie Boys, and James Taylor. &quot;Even Worse&quot; has the distinction of being one of two albums by Yankovic lacking any polka renditions of pop songs or medleys, the other being his self-titled debut album from 1983. This album&#x27;s title and cover art are spoofs of Michael Jackson&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;Bad&quot;.

&quot;Even Worse&quot; was met with mostly positive reviews and peaked at No. 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming Yankovic&#x27;s best-selling album. The album also produced one of Yankovic&#x27;s hit singles, &quot;Fat&quot;, a parody of Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Bad&quot;, which peaked at No. 99 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and became a staple on MTV. The album was certified as a gold record, and later as a platinum record with sales of over one million copies in the United States, becoming Yankovic&#x27;s first platinum record. &quot;Fat&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Concept Music Video.

==Production==
===Background and recording===
After success in the early &#x27;80s, Yankovic released &quot;Polka Party!&quot; in 1986. Although featuring parodies of hit songs like &quot;Living in America&quot; and &quot;Addicted to Love&quot;, the album was a critical and commercial failure. It did not yield a charting single and it peaked at number 177 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. After the disappointment with &quot;Polka Party!&quot;, Yankovic went on record saying, &quot;I thought it was the end of my career.&quot; For most of 1987, Yankovic took a break from recording.

===Originals===
Near the end of 1987, Yankovic returned to the studio to record the original songs that would eventually appear on &quot;Even Worse.&quot; Once again, former the McCoys guitarist Rick Derringer was brought in as producer. The album&#x27;s originals were recorded in three sessions: During the first (which began on November 30, 1987), Yankovic started to record &quot;Stuck in a Closet with Vanna White&quot; and &quot;Melanie&quot;; during the second session (which began on December 1, 1987), he began working on &quot;Good Old Days&quot;, &quot;You Make Me&quot;, and &quot;Velvet Elvis&quot;; and during the final session (which began on February 18, 1988), Yankovic recorded &quot;Twister&quot;.

In &quot;Stuck in a Closet with Vanna White&quot;, the singer recounts a bizarre recurring dream about Vanna White. AllMusic described the song as a &quot;real winner for Yankovic&quot; because it &quot;was the first song [Yankovic] wrote that his [...] target audience [...] actually liked as much or even more than his parodies.&quot; &quot;You Make Me&quot; is a song involving a person&#x27;s desire to engage in strange or violent behavior compelled by the weirdness of another person. According to the liner notes of &quot;The Permanent Record&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s about as close as [Yankovic has] ever come to writing a real love song.&quot; Musically, the song is a style parody of Oingo Boingo.

&quot;Melanie&quot; is a stalker&#x27;s twisted love song to his neighbor Melanie. According to Yankovic, he wrote several additional verses for &quot;Melanie&quot; that he would only sing to his friends. &quot;Velvet Elvis&quot; is written in the style of the Police, and is an ode to the kitschy type of titular painting. &quot;Twister&quot; is an ode to the Milton Bradley game &quot;Twister&quot;. The song is a style parody of Beastie Boys. When Yankovic was recording the song, he initially recorded about 20 vocal takes. However, when it came time to pick the right take, he opted for the first because it sounded &quot;more raw and more off-the-cuff.&quot; The album&#x27;s closer, &quot;Good Old Days&quot; is about a psychopath fondly remembering his childhood. Yankovic described the song as an &quot;experiment&quot;. He &quot;wanted to see if [he] could write a song as if Charlie Manson and James Taylor were collaborating.&quot;

===Parodies===
On February 18, 1988, Yankovic began recording four of the album&#x27;s five parodies: &quot;I Think I&#x27;m a Clone Now&quot;, &quot;Alimony&quot;, &quot;(This Song&#x27;s) Just Six Words Long&quot;, and &quot;Fat&quot;. The first of these is a spoof of on Tiffany&#x27;s 1987 cover of &quot;I Think We&#x27;re Alone Now&quot; that recounts the story of a man who lives with a clone of himself. &quot;Alimony&quot;—a parody of &quot;Mony Mony&quot; as covered by Billy Idol—is a musical diatribe aimed at the narrator&#x27;s ex-wife, who has taken everything he owns for alimony payments. Although &quot;Alimony&quot; sounds as if it were recorded live—complete with clapping, screaming, and yelling—the track was entirely recorded in the studio. &quot;(This Song&#x27;s Just) Six Words Long&quot; is a send up of &quot;Got My Mind Set on You&quot; as performed by George Harrison of the Beatles about a song that does not have enough lyrics to fill 3 minutes worth of time.
When it came time to record a lead single, Yankovic once again turned his attention to Michael Jackson. Jackson had just released his album &quot;Bad&quot;, a follow-up to 1982&#x27;s immensely successful album &quot;Thriller&quot;. After Yankovic first heard the lead single, &quot;Bad&quot;, he immediately envisioned a parody entitled &quot;Fat&quot;. Initially, Yankovic did not want to record another Jackson parody. He later said, &quot;I was still primarily known as the &#x27;Eat It&#x27; guy and I didn&#x27;t want to become known as the guy who just rides Michael&#x27;s coattails.&quot; He later relented and sought out Jackson for permission. Jackson, a fan of Yankovic&#x27;s work, had already let Yankovic parody his 1983 hit single &quot;Beat It&quot;. When presented with the new potential parody, Jackson not only approved it, but let Yankovic use his own &quot;Moonwalker&quot; subway set for the music video. Yankovic later presented Jackson with a gold record of &quot;Even Worse&quot; after the album sold over 500,000 copies. Jackson was so pleased with the song and video, he ordered twelve copies to give to his friends. Yankovic later said, &quot;He doesn&#x27;t have to let me do this kind of stuff. [...] The only reason he would let me is because he has a great sense of humor.&quot;

The music video for the song features a leather-clad Yankovic &quot;expanding to 800 pounds and bouncing around a subway set.&quot; To find suitable back-up dancers, ads were placed in Los Angeles newspapers for &quot;Very Fat Dancers&quot;. One of the men used in the video was actually a pizza delivery man who had delivered food to the casting offices. Due to the music video, &quot;Fat&quot; became one of Yankovic&#x27;s biggest hits. Although only managing to peak at number 99 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, the song&#x27;s music video got extensive play on MTV, which helped the album attain platinum status. In addition, &quot;Fat&quot; was later nominated and won a Grammy Award for Best Concept Music Video at the 1989 Grammy Awards, Yankovic&#x27;s second Grammy Award.

On February 19, 1988, Yankovic began recording the album&#x27;s final parody: &quot;Lasagna&quot;, a take on the traditional folk song &quot;La Bamba&quot;. The song is mainly about Italian culture with a heavy emphasis on cuisine. When Yankovic began writing the song, he originally wanted it to be sung in Italian. He later said, &quot;I was actually going through Italian phrase books and dictionaries until I realized that the humor would be lost on 99% of the audience, so I decided to do the whole thing in English but with kind of a bad Italian accent.&quot; Although &quot;Lasagna&quot; is a parody of the Los Lobos cover version of &quot;La Bamba&quot;, Yankovic did not seek permission from the band to record his spoof, given that &quot;La Bamba&quot; is a traditional folk song with no attributable writer. In the liner notes to &quot;Even Worse&quot;, Yankovic is thus given sole credit for writing &quot;Lasagna&quot;.

According to the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot;, both Prince and George Michael turned down parody ideas that Yankovic asked permission to record for &quot;Even Worse&quot;. In addition, &quot;Even Worse&quot; did not contain a polka medley, Yankovic&#x27;s second—after his debut—and last album not to include one.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

&quot;Even Worse&quot; has received relatively favorable reviews. AllMusic awarded &quot;Even Worse&quot; four out of five stars, one of the highest ratings for Yankovic on the site. Reviewer Eugene Chadbourne said, &quot;Trust Weird Al Yankovic to name an album &quot;Even Worse&quot; even as his recordings were getting better again.&quot; Bruce Britt of &quot;Daily News of Los Angeles&quot; praised that album, and wrote that &quot;It is tempting to dismiss &#x27;Weird Al&#x27; Yankovic as a joke [...] but those who dismiss Yankovic so easily overlook the fact that his lampoons are often wittier than the songs he spoofs.&quot; Many critics praised the lead single, &quot;Fat&quot;. Chadbourne wrote that &quot;the arrogance of &#x27;I&#x27;m Bad&#x27; was perfectly trumped by Yankovic&#x27;s musical pile of lard, the appeal of the video&#x27;s visuals clearly not the only ace in the hole.&quot; Britt called the song and video &quot;so absurd, they are almost certain to be a hit this spring.&quot;

Unlike previous albums, which were praised for their parodies but criticized for their originals, Chadbourne wrote that &quot;Yankovic even manages to shatter all previous barriers and comes up with some funny original material as well,&quot; citing &quot;Good Old Days&quot; and &quot;Stuck in a Closet with Vanna White&quot; as some of his best originals. Both &quot;Even Worse&quot; and &quot;Fat&quot; were nominated for Grammys. Although &quot;Even Worse&quot; was not a winner, &quot;Fat&quot; won a Grammy Award for Best Concept Music Video in 1989.

===Commercial performance===
&quot;Even Worse&quot; was released April 12, 1988, and, at the time of its release, was Yankovic&#x27;s best-selling album. &quot;Even Worse&quot; peaked at number 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 on July 2, 1988. The album spent a total of 26 weeks on the chart. On July 18, 1988—less than three months after its release—the album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). On January 27, 1994, the album was certified Platinum by the RIAA. At the time of its certification, it was Yankovic&#x27;s first Platinum record and, until 1992, it was his best-selling album.

On May 21, 1988, Yankovic appeared as a contestant on the game show &quot;Family Double Dare&quot; to promote &quot;Even Worse&quot;.

<text>Kim Goodman is a woman who holds the world record for the farthest eyeball protrusion (0.47 inches). She lives in Chicago, Illinois. One day, she discovered her eyeball-popping talent when she was hit over the head. Her eyeballs popped out much further than usual, and ever since that day, she could pop them out on cue, as well as when she yawns.

She has appeared on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;.

In 2004, Goodman was included by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; in their 50th anniversary list of the top ten &quot;feats&quot; of all time.

In the Malcolm in the Middle episode titled &quot;Carnival&quot; which premiered May 6th, 2001, Goodman was featured as one of the &quot;circus freaks&quot; displaying her abilities at the 18:06 mark.
