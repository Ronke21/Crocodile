<text>The Kree, briefly known as the Ruul, are an alien race appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. They are native to the planet Hala in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and have a scientifically and technologically advanced militaristic society.

The Kree have appeared throughout the Marvel Cinematic Universe, in the television series &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; and the films &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;, &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; and &quot;The Marvels&quot;.

==Publication history==
The first on-panel appearance of the Kree was in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #65 (August 1967), and they were created by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee. In their first appearance, the Supreme Intelligence sent Ronan to Earth to investigate what happened to a Kree Sentry, who was destroyed by the Fantastic Four in the previous issue.

The Kree made their first major appearances in the first volume of &quot;Captain Marvel&quot;, who was introduced as a Kree warrior who is sent to Earth to spy on its inhabitants in &quot;Marvel Super-Heroes&quot; #12. The following issue would also see the debut of the Yon-Rogg and Carol Danvers a Human/Kree hybrid, who is the seventh and current Captain Marvel. Including Supreme Intelligence, Ronan the Accuser and Doctor Minerva, all of them would feature in the original run of &quot;Captain Marvel&quot;.

The Kree were one of the major factions involved in the 1971&#x27;s &quot;Kree–Skrull War&quot; storyline, the event ran in the first volume of the &quot;Avengers&quot;. The storyline established the war between the Kree and Skrulls, it involves other groups like Avengers, the Inhumans, and the Fantastic Four. It included several plotlines interwoven around the return of Mar-Vell.

They also featured in the first ongoing series of the Inhumans, in which it is established that ancient Kree experimented on ancient humans which resulted in a superpowered offshoot of humanity. The Kree ultimately abandoned their test subjects, and the Inhumans went on to create their own kingdom far away from humanity. The Kree appear in #18–19 of the first Ms. Marvel run. It was also originally planned that Danvers would be artificially impregnated by the Supreme Intelligence.

The conflict between the Kree and Skrull Empire continued in the pages of the third Silver Surfer volume. They returned in the Avengers storyline &quot;Operation Galactic Storm&quot;, a thematic sequel to Kree–Skrull War, the Kree Empire was at war with the Shi&#x27;ar Empire, who were introduced in the Uncanny X-Men. The event introduced the Starforce team.

==Biology==
True Kree resemble humans almost exactly, with the exception of blue skin, different visual systems, and &quot;duplicates&quot; of several internal organs. Kree have a higher strength level than that of a human, and require more nitrogen to breathe comfortably. Kree bodies are adapted to environmental characteristics on Hala that are unlike Earth. Hala has higher gravity and a higher concentration of nitrogen in the atmosphere than Earth. Under Earth&#x27;s lesser gravity, their strength and speed increase. However, they cannot breathe in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere without using a chemical &quot;breathing formula&quot; or artificial life-support devices.

The original Kree had blue-colored skin, but a second racial group with pink skin resembling that of human Caucasians emerged over the millennia. The blue, &quot;purebred&quot; Kree have become a small, but powerful, minority. Pink Kree are much more durable than their blue racial brethren.

Adult Kree range (typically) between tall. Some female Kree can physically influence men, and a few can even drain the life force of others. Most are born with this ability, but are required to have it surgically &#x27;corrected&#x27; upon adulthood. They must undergo this procedure when they are adults in order to avoid &#x27;frying&#x27; their brains. It seems that this procedure is analogous to female genital mutilation and it is also called &quot;psychological mutilation&quot; as witnessed with Una-Rogg.

Just like humans, some Kree also suffer from various diseases such as Blackgorge, Betath&#x27;s Plague, the Wasting, and cancer which they call Blackend.

The Kree were an evolutionarily stagnant race. This was due to a single member of the Kree race attempting to gain control of The Crystal of Ultimate Vision. This unnamed Kree found the crystal, but attempted to use it to become akin to a god, with powers as of those of the Phoenix Force. As punishment, the crystal &quot;genetically froze their evolution in place&quot; allowing the rest of creation to pass them by. In an attempt to further their development, some Kree bred with other species, producing the &#x27;pink-skinned&#x27; Kree, who are similar in appearance to Caucasian humans. These pinks (also called &#x27;whites&#x27;) eventually outnumbered the blue-skin Kree, but were far from accepted amongst their brethren; many pink kree were exiled from the homeworld and put into forced labor camps on barren moons by their blue skinned cousins due to prejudice and racism. The Kree value what they consider to be their genetic purity, to such an extent that reproduction outside of the species is a strict taboo. In the Kree empire, it is a crime for a male non-Kree to impregnate any Kree.

The Kree race has produced individual super-humanoid beings, either through natural mutation, genetic engineering, or cyborg technology, including Mar-Vell, Ronan the Accuser, Ultimus, Shatterax, Korath, and others.

The Supreme Intelligence attempted to jumpstart the evolutionary process of the Kree. Through a series of events discussed below during &quot;Operation: Galactic Storm&quot; and the &quot;Destiny War&quot;, it arranged for a large number of its people to be irradiated with a Nega-Bomb (killing 90% of the Kree), and then artificially sped up their evolution by means of an artifact called the Forever Crystal.

This new brand of evolved Kree, called Ruul, have a grayish skin tone and many shoulder-length tentacles atop their heads. Individuals possess the ability to consciously &#x27;will&#x27; adaptation of physical form to different environments, affording them controlled metamorphosis, spontaneously developing the ability to breathe underwater, fly, change form or whatever their circumstances require. The females had also lost their ability, since the males now had that ability.

The Inhumans later brought to light a long-held secret about the creation of the Kree. As it turns out, the Kree are in fact of Universal Inhuman stock, the very first of the first of their kind. Unlike a great many races throughout the universe, the Kree were alternated by two races of cosmological abstracts in the likes of the Celestials and the Progenitors, which evolved them from primitives to empire builders. While the Celestials went on to spawn the Kree born Eternals, it was the Progenitors, a race of universal gardeners and cosmic scientists that made their home at the far end of the cosmos within the heart of a lone star, who through the introduction of the Prima Materia which the Progenitors mine and process on their World Farm called The Primagen, were able to force evolve the cro-magnon Kree race into the cosmic conquerors that they are today.

==Culture==
The Kree are an imperialistic and militaristic society with the only widespread religion being worship of the Supreme Intelligence. A small minority, like the Priests of Pama, practice a pacifist Cotati religion, but this is forbidden (early &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; stories mentioned an &#x27;idol&#x27; called Tam-Borr and a &#x27;fabricated&#x27; god named Zo, whom Mar-Vell served between issues 11 and 15). Some are members of the Universal Church of Truth.

The Kree Empire extends throughout nearly a thousand worlds in the northwestern lobe (Earth reference) of the Greater Magellanic Cloud with outposts in other galaxies.

Kree names are usually short, being one or two syllables. Given names are separated from surnames by a hyphen. Examples include Mar-Vell, Yon-Rogg, Una-Rogg, and Zey-Rogg.

Some Kree names reference the comic book industry, such as Mar-Vell (Marvel Comics), Att-Las (Atlas Comics), Dea-Sea (DC Comics), and Star-Lyn (Jim Starlin).

Generally, the offspring of officers of the Kree Imperial Militia are immediately conscripted.

===Population===
The Kree population was in excess of 30 billion prior to the Nega-Bomb detonation. The Kree lost an alleged 98% of their population after the Bomb detonated. Although the pink-skinned Kree are in the majority, it is the blue-skinned Kree, such as Ronan, who dominate their society.

High population and technological development allow for highly urbanized planets. Most of the surface of Hala, the origin planet of the civilization, is covered by futuristic city-states, and the second capital planet, Kree-lar, is described as &quot;the most heavily populated world of all&quot;.

===Government===
Under the Supreme Intelligence, the Kree Empire was a military dictatorship. Under Clumsy Foulup, the Kree were temporarily a monarchy, and while under Ael-Dan and Dar-Benn they were a military dictatorship.

Leaders of the Kree have included the Supreme Intelligence, Clumsy Foulup, Nenora, Zarek, Ael-Dan and Dar-Ben, Phae-Dor, Tus-Katt, Morag, Ronan the Accuser, and—most recently—Black Bolt of the Inhumans.

The Kree began their empire over a million years ago, within a hundred years of the acquisition of interstellar technology from the Skrulls (at that time, a benevolent people). The Skrulls at the time were attempting to start a galactic empire of their own, this one based on free trade, and they landed on Hala to help the barbaric natives advance to the point where they could join.

Although Hala &quot;is&quot; the &quot;official&quot; planet of the Kree&#x27;s origin, for a time, the planet Kree-Lar in the Turunal system served as the capital of the Kree Empire as well as the seat of the government. The Kree Empire is ruled as a militaristic dictatorship. The permanent ruler was the organic computer-construct called the Supremor (or Supreme Intelligence), an immense computer system to which the preserved brains of the greatest intellects of the Kree race have been linked. Aiding the Supreme Intelligence were a number of imperial administrators on Kree-Lar, who are also governors of each of the member worlds, and a vast standing space militia. They also employ powerful automatons called Sentries whose job it is to keep member worlds under the empire&#x27;s watchful eye.

The Kree empire is later ruled by Black Bolt and the Inhuman Royal Family who gained power after Ronan the Accuser, ruler of the Kree after the Supreme Intelligence&#x27;s demise, submitted to him.

=== Languages ===
The Kree language exist in different versions, including at least ancient Imperial Kree and Kreevian.

=== Money ===
The Kree used as currency the kredits, or credits.

=== Technology ===
The Kree Empire extends across a thousand worlds in the northwestern lobe (Earth reference) of the Greater Magellanic Cloud. They are the only race in the galaxy to possess the Omni-Wave Projector technology, a device which can enable communication across hyperspace as well as be used in an offensive capacity as a weapon. They also possess cloaking technology, which they call the &#x27;aura of negativity&#x27;.

Kree technology includes advanced warp-drive starships, robotics (such as the Sentries and the Destructoids), bionic and cybernetic (Cy-Mek) technology, advanced genetic engineering, psionic technology (Psyche-Magnitron), advanced energy weaponry (Uni-Beam), cosmic power generation, nuclear/antimatter weapons and even dimensional linking and siphoning devices. Across the myriad of realities further advancements of Prime Marvel Universe Kree Tech. has been made in strides.

Some Kree inventions have been outlawed, such as the organic-destroying robots Null-Trons, corpse revitalizing Mim Units, and the genetic-enhance Psyche-Magnitron.

In ultimate comics, they make use of nanomolecular shapeshifting battle armor with advanced genetic tailoring capabilities which can harness thermonuclear to cosmological force as both weaponry and power source. The multiversal traveler Marvel Boy makes use of similar metamorphic technology powered by whats called Kirby Engineering, mechanical works powered through belief and mental interfacing along with shifting liquid metal or self-replicating nanotech.

==Fictional history==
===Antiquity===
Eons ago, beings of massive power known as Progenitors arrived on Hala, and employed on its population a substance known as Prima Materia, which served to evolve this population from their primitive form. The planet would eventually be visited by another race of beings who would also experiment on its population.

A million years ago, a race called the Skrulls came upon Hala. At that time, the Skrulls were a largely peaceful space-faring race, and they set about educating the natives to the point where they could join their trading empire. However, Hala was home to two equally intelligent races, the Kree and the Cotati.

The Skrulls proposed a test which involved taking members of each race to distant planetoids, with supplies for one year, and then returning at the end to judge what each group had created. The Skrulls took the Cotati to a barren moon and then brought the Kree to Earth&#x27;s moon where they created the Blue Area of the Moon. While the Cotati created a beautiful garden, the Kree constructed the magnificent Blue City.

The Skrulls returned to judge the accomplishments of the groups and return them all to Hala. Once back on their homeworld, the Kree leader Morag learned that the Skrulls had been impressed by the city, but the other Skrulls were more impressed by the Cotati&#x27;s success. Enraged, the Kree wiped out the Cotati and then, when the Skrull protested, killed them as well and seized the Skrulls&#x27; starship. They then set about deciphering the technology of the starship.

===Kree–Skrull War===
When acquiring the technology from the Skrulls, the Kree began to spread throughout the Greater Magellanic Cloud. The Kree launched an attack upon the Skrull empire and the peaceful Skrulls were again forced to become war-like.

At the same time, the Cotati on Hala were almost driven to extinction. However, a small handful of pacifist Kree, hid and kept safe a group of Cotati. Eventually, these Kree began worshipping the Cotati that they had kept sheltered. To further hide and keep them safe, the priests relocated the surviving Cotati throughout the universe.

Years later, the Kree, aware that the Skrulls had once created the Cosmic Cube, designed a cybernetic/organic supercomputer called the Supreme Intelligence to help them in creating a Cube. When the computer became functional, it determined that a Cosmic Cube would be too dangerous to construct and refused the Science Council&#x27;s request.

At the beginning of the War, the Kree established a station on Uranus. Through their work, they discovered that sentient life on Earth had genetic potential invested in it by the Celestials. Intrigued, the Kree began to experiment on humans.

Their goal was twofold – to investigate possible ways of circumventing their own evolutionary stagnation, and to create powerful soldiers to use against the Skrulls. However, the Kree abandoned their experiments because the Supreme Intelligence foresaw the experiments leading to the destruction of the Kree. In order to disprove that prophecy, the Intelligence ordered Accuser Huran to murder the scientists responsible for the experiments and summon the Accuser Corps to cleanse the experiments. In its haste, however, the Supreme Intelligence failed to download the full data packet, and five worlds that were seeded escaped the slaughter: Badoon, Centaurians, Dire Wraiths, Kymellians, and early humans.

The humans test subjects, eventually dubbed the Inhumans, went on to form a society of their own. Later a surveillance robot, Sentry 459, that was stationed on a South Pacific island was eventually awakened by the Fantastic Four and alerted the Kree. This caused Ronan the Accuser to punish those who &quot;murdered&quot; the guard, but the Fantastic Four defeated him.

As the war dragged on, the Supreme Intelligence accrued more political power and responsibility until finally it was elected as absolute ruler of the Kree and came to be worshipped.

====The War comes to Earth====
The Earth&#x27;s importance as a strategic beachhead became apparent when the Avengers became involved in the Kree-Skrull hostilities. In the meantime, the Kree were reestablishing cultural ties with the Inhumans.

At this point, the Kree hero, Captain Marvel, revealed to the Avengers that the Kree were planning to &#x27;erase&#x27; humanity. This scheme was foiled by Mar-Vell and the Avengers.

As the war escalated and Earth&#x27;s position became increasingly precarious, the original Avengers were recalled to active service after a Skrull scouting party managed to abduct Mar-Vell, Quicksilver, and Scarlet Witch and also attempted to destroy the Inhumans&#x27; Great Refuge, but failed when the Avengers intervened. During the conflict, the Super-Skrull took his prisoners back to the Skrull home-world, leaving the remaining Avengers to pick up the pieces and reform their tattered forces.

The conflict worsened when the Avengers began to understand the scale of the war. They discovered a Skrull fleet wanting to destroy Earth and a Kree fleet wanting to stop them. All sides were determined to either invade or decimate the Earth in order to prevent it falling into the &#x27;wrong&#x27; hands. Led by Thor, Iron Man, and The Vision, the Avengers launched an attack on the Skrull flagship, somehow managing to turn back the fleet after a desperate battle.

The war came to a close when the Supreme Intelligence managed to bring Rick Jones into his presence and temporarily altered Rick&#x27;s DNA to release his &#x27;full evolutionary potential.&#x27; Armed with godlike powers, Rick froze both Kree and Skrull forces, allowing the Intelligence to re-establish control over his people and bring the war to a halt.

===Further Kree–Skrull Wars===
At several points in the years after the end of the first Kree–Skrull war, hostilities were said to have broken out again between the two empires.

The most significant of these instances came when the Skrulls lost their ability to shapeshift, and a Skrull Warlord provoked new hostilities. During this war, the Supreme Intelligence was incapacitated by the Silver Surfer. Afterwards, Nenora, a Skrull spy in the guise of a high ranking Kree official, took command of the Kree empire. The war ended with Nenora&#x27;s death at the hands of S&#x27;ybill, the Skrull Empress. Rulership of the Kree was assumed by an alien named Clumsy Foulup, who was soon assassinated by Kree military officers.

The machinations of Thanos led to the sudden elimination of half the universe&#x27;s life-forms. Unaware of Thanos&#x27; role in the disappearance, the Kree and the Skrull blamed each other and temporarily renewed fighting.

===Kree-Shi&#x27;ar War===
Not long after the conflicts with the Skrull ended, the Kree again found themselves embroiled in a war, this time with the Shi&#x27;ar Empire. This war was much shorter, and was engineered by the Skrulls and the Supreme Intelligence.

The Avengers of Earth became involved in the conflict when the Shi&#x27;ar opened a wormhole in Earth&#x27;s solar system to gain rapid access to Kree territory, unconcerned about the damage that would be caused to Earth&#x27;s Sun as a result. Their involvement inadvertently set off a chain of events which led to a powerful artifact known as Nega-Bomb being detonated in Kree space, causing an explosive and radioactive reaction that devastated the Kree empire, with ninety percent of the Kree dying, and led to its surrender to the Sh&#x27;iar. It was later revealed that the Supreme Intelligence was ultimately responsible for the Bomb&#x27;s detonation as part of an attempt to kick-start the Kree race&#x27;s genetic development. Appalled by this callous disregard for the life of its people, a group of Avengers executed the living supercomputer. The Kree territory was then annexed by the Sh&#x27;iar, with Majestrix Lilandra naming her sister Deathbird as the territory&#x27;s administrator. Deathbird has since abandoned this post.

===Ruul and retcon===
Due to the large amount of radiation of the Nega-Bomb, the remaining Kree slowly began evolving which was sped up through the machinations of the Supreme Intelligence and the Forever Crystal until they transformed and renamed themselves into a new species: the Ruul. As the Ruul, they resembled grey humanoids with tendrils on the back and side of the head and an overall reptilian appearance. The most notable ability of the Ruul was their ability to evolve their forms spontaneously to suit whatever situation was required. Under the ruse of being a spacefaring species from beyond charted space, the race orchestrated the events of &quot;Maximum Security&quot; that temporarily turned Earth into a prison. While their plans for Earth was prevented when their Kree origin and behind-the-scenes manipulations were revealed, they were able to launch their fleet in secret and reclaiming Hala and numerous other Kree worlds from their Shi’ar masters and commenced a campaign of aggressive expansion. The machinations of the Supreme Intelligence were undone when a cosmically empowered Genis-Vell, son of Mar-Vell, restored the Kree race to its original form when he destroyed and recreated the universe.

Kree soldiers also appeared during &quot;Avengers Disassembled&quot;, when they attacked the Earth and were driven off by the Avengers.

===Annihilation===
In &quot;Annihilation&quot; #2, it is revealed that many Kree soldiers, commanded by the merchant House of Fiyero, joined the United Front to fight the Annihilation Wave. After killing the Supreme Intelligence and wiping out the House of Fiyero, Ronan the Accuser assumes control of the Kree Empire.

===Annihilation: Conquest===
During &quot;&quot;, the Kree Empire is assimilated by the Phalanx and Ultron, and isolate Kree space from the rest of the universe, but are stopped by the Guardians of the Galaxy, Nova, Warlock, and Warlock&#x27;s adopted son Tyro.

===Secret Invasion===
The Kree have an agent on Earth that learns about the Skrull &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; but he is supposedly killed before he can summon help.

Noh-Varr proclaims the planet under Kree protection and takes part in the final battle. He is deemed a hero by the planet&#x27;s population and by the Kree that learn of his bravery during the attack. He serves on Osborn&#x27;s Avengers until he learns of their true nature. While on the run, he manages to communicate with the Supreme Intelligence who grants him the title and position of Protector of Earth and bestows a pair of custom Negabands to him.

===War of Kings===
Shortly after the Invasion of Earth occurs, the Inhumans begin their personal assault on the Skrull Empire. After destroying a Skrull warship that has fled into Shi&#x27;ar Space, as well as three Shi&#x27;ar Warbirds, the Inhumans next travel to Kree-lar and claim dominion over the Kree Empire.

Emperor Vulcan, leader of the Shi&#x27;ar, declares war against the Kree and launches a surprise attack during the wedding of Ronan and Crystal. The Kree retaliate and through the actions of the various royal family members they endear themselves to the Kree.

After the assassination of former Empress Lilandra, the Kree launch a T-Bomb powered by Black Bolt&#x27;s voice, intended to end the war swiftly and decisively. Black Bolt is attacked by Vulcan and the two are presumed dead when the bomb explodes in Shi&#x27;ar territory. The Kree claim victory and control of the Shi&#x27;ar empire.

===Realm of Kings===
Medusa briefly struggles as sole ruler of the Kree Empire until Black Bolt returned to Attilan shortly after his supposed death. He led the Kree and Inhumans into battle during the War of Four Cities.

===Avengers vs X-Men===
In &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men,&quot; in the wake of the Phoenix Force&#x27;s advent, making its way towards earth in search for its latest host. Noh-Varr is contacted by the Supreme Intelligence demanding that he capture its power for the Kree Empire. Once after initial failure, earth&#x27;s mightiest are eventually successful in the acquisition of its essence, however, Protector betrays the team and hands it to the Supremor as per his mission directive.

But then realizing the Kree had no intention of saving Earth from the Phoenix, Noh quickly turns on them and returns the Phoenix essence to the enraged Avengers who leave him behind on Hala as they return to earth. Noh on the other hand is hunted mercilessly for his betrayal. Before they manage to find him, however, he plants a bomb that eviscerates his assailants along with the Supremor&#x27;s main housing.

A secret group working around the Kree hierarchy through Plex like mind control would later use the power of the cosmic force in conjunction with the M&#x27;Kraan Crystal to revitalize the original Captain Mar-Vell. With a now resurrected Kree hero at their command, the Kree designate heroes Carol Danvers and Noh-Varr would soon fall under command of Mar-Vell and the gene-based manipulatory broadcast used to manipulate the Kree into their service. Causing them to turn on the Secret Avengers and order a public execution for some of them as the Phoenix arrives.

As it was later revealed, disgraced descendants of Mar-Vell would act to draw the Phoenix away from Earth and towards Hala in a suicidal attempt to kick-start the races transcendence. This plan failed as the Vision emitted a counter broadcast to said grand nephew&#x27;s unique telepathic abilities controlling everyone on Hala, as the father committed suicide before killing his own son, The Kree homeworld was spared when Captain Marvel sacrificed his own life and the Phoenix energies sustaining him as the entity came to take it back.

===Infinity===
During the &quot;Infinity&quot; storyline, Ronan the Accuser and the Supreme Intelligence appear as members of the Galactic Council where they represent the Kree Empire. In the aftermath of the fight with the Builders and the fight against Thanos, the Supreme Intelligence was able to pardon Ronan the Accuser and the Kree Army.

===The Black Vortex===
During &quot;The Black Vortex&quot; storyline, Ronan the Accuser steals The Black Vortex from the cosmically-powered X-Men, who then rampage on Hala. They eventually leave, but Mister Knife uses the opportunity to steal The Black Vortex and then destroys Hala and the Supreme Intelligence out of petty revenge. Ronan and the Imperial Fleet survive and the last remaining seed of the Supreme Intelligence was stolen from Collector by Star-Lord&#x27;s half-sister Captain Victoria.

===Royals===
As the Inhuman royal family, aided by Noh-Varr, make their way to the ruins of Hala in search of the Primagen. They are encountered by the still cosmically empowered Ronan the Accuser, who traps them all in a prison tailored to torment each of its detainees.

Marvel Boy works around it with his own battlefield device. Moving to free the Inhumans with the help of Maximus while soothing the accuser with simulations of a thriving Kree Emperium.

Having helped sow the seeds to reestablish the reformation of the fallen Kree, The Royals depart. Leaving the last accuser to pick up the pieces and hopefully mend itself with the help of the steadily regrowing Plex Intelligence, with Crystal coming along.

===Death of the Inhumans===

It is revealed that at some point the Supreme Intelligence had sent a Kree contingency away to explore and chart the Universe in order to find purchase and grow the name of Hala throughout the stars. The mission took generations and currently those among the contingency had never seen or set foot on their home planet, only able to dream of it. Eventually they finally returned to Hala, only to find it in ruins. They eliminated Ronan, exiled those loyal to him and decided to use the Inhumans as part of their plans to rebuild Hala and bring a new dawn to the Kree Empire. To that effect, they designed Vox, a new kind of Inhuman which have all the powers of an Inhuman but none of the humanity, initiating in the process a campaign of terror that killed thousands of Inhumans. It was later revealed that the Kree soldiers behind Vox had actually captured Ronan the Accuser and those loyal to him to be experimented on. After breaking free and killing some Kree soldiers, Black Bolt finds where Ronan, now a cyborg, is being held and kills him out of mercy. During the Inhuman Royal Family&#x27;s final assault on the Kree, Vox sent an army of brainwashed Inhumans to confront Black Bolt as he entered the location responsible for maintaining the Kree&#x27;s control over the brainwashed Inhumans. Black Bolt was forced to use his powerful voice to wipe out everyone there in order to stop the Kree&#x27;s plans. Vox and his Kree masters were eventually forced to retreat.

===Infinity Countdown===
The resurrected Plex Intelligence, now calling itself the Extreme Intelligence sought the acquisition of the Infinity Stones to rebirth its Empire.

===Empyre===
In the &quot;Road to Empyre,&quot; Teddy Altman is made a mysterious offer at the cost of leaving Billy Kaplan. He accepts the offer which was to become the new ruler of the Kree-Skrull Alliance, adopting the mantle of &quot;Dorrek VIII,&quot; and beginning the preparations of invading the Earth for &quot;the final war.&quot;

General G&#x27;iah and her daughters named Alice, Ivy, and Madison obtain a sample of Cotati from a lab while explaining the history of the Kree and the Skrull&#x27;s feud. At their motel, they are ambushed by a Kree operative. General G&#x27;iah leads her daughters track the assailant to a Kree family. After G&#x27;iah&#x27;s daughters prevent her from retaliating against them, the patriarch of the Kree family that blew up their motel room suddenly receives a message on his Kree-tech cellphone by Dorrek VIII stating to all Kree and Skrull soldiers in the field that the Kree and Skrull armadas have united to face a common enemy. They are coming to Earth to destroy them as he speaks. The enemy is eventually revealed to be the Cotati who are returning as well as the Celestial Messiah. In the Kree/Skrull Alliance, Dorekk VIII has gained Captain Glory, Mur-G&#x27;nn, Tanalth the Pursuer, and Super-Skrull as his inner circle. When the Avengers learned about the Cotati&#x27;s true motives, they decided to work together to fight the Cotati and prevent them from eliminating all animal life.

===Marvel Cinematic Universe===
The Kree were informally introduced into the Marvel Cinematic Universe through the TV series &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; In the episode &quot;T.A.H.I.T.I.&quot;, S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson discovers a blue-skinned corpse in a secret, underground facility called the Guest House while searching for the source of the regenerative GH-325 serum. Executive producer Jeffrey Bell later confirmed that this was the body of a Kree. In the episode &quot;Yes Men&quot;, Coulson asks Sif if she has encountered any blue-colored alien species. The Kree are among the species she lists by name, though she insists they have never visited Earth. In season 2 episodes &quot;...Ye Who Enter Here&quot;, &quot;What They Become&quot;, and &quot;Who You Really Are&quot;, it is revealed that a rogue Kree faction visited Earth as part of their experiments to create genetically altered soldiers. According to Raina, in contrast to others believing they were acting to conquer or destroy humanity, the Kree created the Diviners for the purpose of engineering Inhumans while wiping out those the relics deem unworthy of the process. The episode &quot;Who You Really Are&quot; revealed that these Kree, whose experiments failed on other planets, have been eliminated by the Kree Empire. Having been alerted by a signal, a Kree warrior named Vin-Tak (portrayed by Eddie McClintock) came to Earth to find the remaining Diviners that the rogue Kree faction hid on Earth to ensure the experiments would not resume in the event that the remnants of the rogue Kree faction came to Earth. Running afoul of Coulson&#x27;s team and Sif, whose memory he temporarily robbed with his truncheon, Vin-Tak learned that Skye was an Inhuman and attempts to kill her. Luckily, Bobbi Morse uses Vin-Tak&#x27;s truncheon to have himself forget why he came to Earth as Sif escorts him back to Hala. In the episode &quot;Scars&quot;, it is shown that Robert Gonzales&#x27; faction of S.H.I.E.L.D. has obtained a monolith-like material that the Kree planned to use to destroy the Inhumans. This rock sends anyone who is sucked into it to another planet where an Inhuman being known as Hive was banished to. In the episode &quot;Failed Experiments&quot;, it was revealed that the Kree warriors known as Kree Reapers were the ones responsible for abducting the humans for the Inhuman experiments just like they did with the Mayan warrior that became Hive. When the device that was used to make Inhumans was activated by Hive, it attracted the attention of the Kree Reapers where one of them killed Alisha Whitley. Both of them were killed by Hive and Daisy Johnson where the blood of one of them was used in Hive&#x27;s Inhuman-making projects. Season Five introduced the Kree Kasius (portrayed by Dominic Rains), Sinara (portrayed by Florence Faivre), Hek-Sel (portrayed by Luke Massy) and Kasius&#x27; brother Faulnak (portrayed by Samuel Roukin) who exist in the year 2091. The episode &quot;The One Who Will Save Us All&quot; introduces the Kree Taryan (portrayed by Craig Parker) who is the father of Kasius and Faulnak and the Kree&#x27;s representative on the Confederacy.

The Kree are featured in the 2014 film &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;. Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) and Korath the Pursuer (Djimon Hounsou) are the only notable Kree individuals that appear in the film. The Kree Empire is stated to have just signed a peace treaty with the Nova Corps of Xandar, thereby ending a centuries-long war between the two races. This treaty prompts the radical Ronan to embark on a renegade campaign of genocide against all Xandarians. To the Nova Corps&#x27; frustration, the Kree Ambassador (Tomas Arana) tells Irani Rael that the Kree Empire refuses to stop Ronan&#x27;s killing spree and that his plot is not their concern as they have done enough with the peace treaty.

The Kree briefly appear in the 2017 film &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2&quot;, where their planet Hala was nearly destroyed by Ego.

Mar-Vell and the Supreme Intelligence also appear in the film, both played by Annette Bening. Yon-Rogg came to Earth when the Kree discovered that Mar-Vell was working on a light-speed engine experiment as well as harboring some Skrulls. When Mar-Vell died in a crash with Carol Danvers and Yon-Rogg arrived, Carol shot the engine and got exposed to its energies. After a blood transfusion from Yon-Rogg, Carol&#x27;s memories were altered and worked under him and the Supreme Intelligence. Carol then arrived back on Earth following an encounter with the Skrulls led by Talos. When it came to a parley with Talos, Carol learned what the Kree did to the Skrulls and their homeworld. After getting the dampener removed from her head, Carol uses her powers to fight the Kree forces which resulted in most of them either being killed or incapacitated. Yon-Rogg was sent back to Hala to relay Carol&#x27;s message to the Supreme Intelligence.

The Kree Dar-Benn appeared in &quot;The Marvels&quot; as the film&#x27;s main antagonist, battling against Carol Danvers, Kamala Khan and Monica Rambeau.

While Kalum Lo and his soldiers take over Kang the Conqueror&#x27;s ship &quot;Damocles&quot; (which has been converted into a S.W.O.R.D. base), Ronan tasks Yon-Rogg and Mar-Vell to go to Earth to judge the humans to see if Earth is worthy to join the Kree Empire. Kalum Lo had the Kree&#x27;s alien slave Sydren enter various codes into Damocles&#x27; computer in order to get control of the entire ship. Abigail Brand defeats the Kree and frees Sydren from the Kree&#x27;s control.

After fighting their way past the Kree Sentries, Galen-Kor and the Kree soldiers with him fought the Avengers until they left the ship upon filling it with a dangerous gas that the Kree aren&#x27;t affected by. When the dangerous gas was filtered out of the ship, Galen-Kor attacked his fighter jet with the other Kree soldiers and the Kree Sentries while having a missile that will launch the dangerous gas the Earth. With help from the other Avengers, Captain Marvel, Captain America, Falcon, and Thor deactivate the missiles, defeat Galen-Kor and his soldiers, and transfer their Inhuman captives to Attilan.

<text>Cipriano Ricardo Flores Magón (, known as Ricardo Flores Magón; September 16, 1874 – November 21, 1922) was a Mexican anarchist and social reform activist. His brothers Enrique and Jesús were also active in politics. Followers of the Flores Magón brothers were known as Magonistas. He has been considered an important participant in the social movement that sparked the Mexican Revolution.

== Biography ==
Ricardo was born on 16 September 1874, in San Antonio Eloxochitlán, Oaxaca, an Indigenous Mazatec community. His father, Teodoro Flores, was Zapotec and his mother, Margarita Magón was a Mestiza. The couple met each other in 1863 during the Siege of Puebla when both were carrying munitions to the Mexican troops.

Magón explored the writings and ideas of many early anarchists, such as Mikhail Bakunin and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, but was also influenced by anarchist contemporaries Élisée Reclus, Charles Malato, Errico Malatesta, Anselmo Lorenzo, Emma Goldman, and Fernando Tarrida del Mármol. He was most influenced by Peter Kropotkin. He also read from the works of Karl Marx and Henrik Ibsen.

He was one of the major thinkers of the Mexican Revolution and the Mexican revolutionary movement in the Partido Liberal Mexicano. Flores Magón organised with the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and edited the Mexican anarchist newspaper &quot;Regeneración&quot;, which aroused the workers against the dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz.

Kropotkin&#x27;s &quot;The Conquest of Bread&quot;, which Flores Magón considered a kind of anarchist bible, served as basis for the short-lived revolutionary communes in Baja California during the &quot;Magonista&quot; Revolt of 1911.

The Magón brothers were from a family of modest means in Oaxaca and all three studied law at the Escuela Nacional de Jurisprudencia (today Faculty of Law of the UNAM). Ricardo initially attended the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria. During this time, he participated in student opposition to President Porfirio Diaz and he was jailed for five months. Nevertheless, he graduated and then transferred to the National School of Law. While there, he worked as a proofreader for the student newspaper &quot;El Demócrata&quot; and narrowly escaped arrest when the entire staff was arrested by the police. He was in hiding for three months but continued his studies and received his law degree in 1895 and passed the examination of the Barra Mexicana-Colegio de Abogados (Mexican Bar and Advocate&#x27;s College). He practiced law for a short time and continued to study for a higher degree but was expelled from the school in 1898 because of his political activities. In 1900, he and his brother Jesús founded the newspaper &quot;Regeneración&quot; in which Ricardo wrote numerous articles attacking Diaz. He also wrote articles for the opposition periodicals &quot;Excelsior&quot;, &quot;La República Mexicana&quot;, and &quot;El Hijo del Ahuizote&quot;. He joined the PLM in 1900.
==Flight to the United States==

In 1904, Magón fled Mexico when the courts banned the printing of his writings and he remained in the United States for the remainder of his life. Half this period was spent in prison. He resumed publication of &quot;Regeneración&quot; and led the &quot;Partido Liberal Mexicano&quot; (PLM) (Mexican Liberal Party) from abroad. In 1906, he went to California. Around this time PLM uprisings occurred in Mexico which were crushed by the Mexican government. The US sympathized with the Mexican government and started taking PLM leaders in the US into custody. Magón was fearful that he would be caught and be returned to Mexico, where he faced the possibility of execution.

In 1907, an American detective by the name of Thomas Furlong was employed by Enrique Creel, at that time governor of Chihuahua, to locate Mexican dissidents in the U.S. The American headquarters of the PLM was in St. Louis at that time. There were a large number of expatriates who knew of its whereabouts and as a result, Furlong had no difficulty locating the dissidents in the city. Magón, however, was living in great secrecy in Los Angeles. He used a pseudonym, and only two other persons in the city knew his real identity. If they needed to see him, they did so between midnight and dawn. The dissidents in St. Louis soon became aware that they were being sought by agents working for the Mexican government. Librado Rivera left the city in order to evade capture and although he was constantly on alert for agents who might be shadowing him, he failed to elude them. He was followed to Los Angeles and to Magón&#x27;s place of residence. Furlong kept the house under surveillance for some time. Finally, on August 23, 1907, Magón, Rivera and Antonio Villarreal were taken into custody by Furlong, two of his assistants and some officers from the Los Angeles police department.

Magón and other PLM members had organized a brigade of revolutionaries in Douglas, Arizona in the years preceding his move to Los Angeles. An expedition was sent to the Cananea copper mines about thirty miles from the southern border of Arizona with the alleged intention of exterminating all Americans employed in and about the mines. The brigade had been pursued by the Arizona Rangers who put them to flight, capturing a few of them. Magón and his companions were extradited to Tombstone, Arizona where they were charged with violating U.S. neutrality laws. Although the American and Mexican left rallied to their defense, they were convicted and sentenced to eighteen months in Yuma Territorial Prison, later being transferred to Arizona State Prison Complex – Florence. They were released in 1910 and again resumed publishing &quot;Regeneración&quot; from an office in downtown Los Angeles. The Mexican Civil War began that same year, and the &quot;Magonistas&quot;, as the PLM forces were known, were involved in combat throughout Mexico, along with the forces of Pancho Villa, Emiliano Zapata and Venustiano Carranza and Francisco I. Madero.

By May 1911, Diaz was defeated. Madero organized an election, which he won by deceiving the Mexican electorate into believing that he had joined forces with the PLM. Magón continued to oppose the vast American economic presence in Mexico, and Madero&#x27;s continuing expropriation of peasant lands. He was arrested again. After two years in prison in Washington state, he was released and settled with brother Enrique in Edendale, just north of the Silver Lake Reservoir. The PLM had no funds by this time, and the brothers and their friends farmed and raised chickens on the rented plot of land. He continued publishing &quot;Regeneración&quot; and making speeches in the region. One of the places Magon stayed was in the city of El Monte, part of the San Gabriel Valley in Los Angeles County. During his time in El Monte, Magon wrote letters to comrades in Mexico, as well was involved in local anarchist activities while supporting himself and family picking up work in local ranches in the area. He was again arrested in 1916, accused of sending &quot;indecent materials&quot; through the U.S. Mail. With the help of Emma Goldman, he made bail. 

In 1918, he published an anti-war manifesto. In this he wrote, &quot;The death of the old order is at hand. It is being whispered in the bars, theatres, streetcars and homes, especially in our homes, the homes of those at the bottom.&quot; For these writings, he was charged with sedition under the Espionage Act of 1917, convicted and sentenced to twenty years for &quot;obstructing the war effort&quot;, a violation of the Espionage Act of 1917. The Wilson administration conducted what were called the Palmer Raids, a wholesale crackdown on war dissidents and leftists that also swept up notable socialists such as Eugene V. Debs. Magón died at Leavenworth Penitentiary in Kansas. He had been suffering from diabetes for many years and was losing his eyesight by the time of his death.

The cause of Flores Magón&#x27;s death has been disputed. Some believe that he was deliberately murdered by prison guards. Others contend that he died as a result of deteriorating health caused by his long imprisonment, possibly exacerbated by medical neglect by Leavenworth Penitentiary officials and staff. Magón wrote several letters to friends complaining of debilitating health problems and of what he perceived to be purposeful neglect by the prison staff.

The Mexican Chamber of Deputies adopted a resolution requesting the repatriation of Magón&#x27;s body. It stated,

The U.S. authorities denied the request and Magón was buried in Los Angeles. His remains were finally repatriated in 1945 and interred at the Rotunda of Illustrious Persons in Mexico City.

== Legacy ==

Flores Magón&#x27;s movement fired the imagination of both American and Mexican anarchists. In 1945, his remains were repatriated to Mexico and were interred in the &quot;Rotonda de los Hombres Ilustres&quot; in Mexico City. In Mexico, the Flores Magón brothers are considered left-wing political icons nearly as notable as Emiliano Zapata; numerous streets, public schools, towns and neighborhoods are named after them. This includes Ricardo Flores Magón metro station in Mexico City, and the municipalities of Teotitlán de Flores Magón and Eloxochitlán de Flores Magón in Oaxaca. His ideas have also inspired indigenous leaders from Oaxaca, Mexico including the Chatino leader Tomas Cruz Lorenzo.

In 1991, Douglas Day published &quot;The Prison Notebooks of Ricardo Flores Magón&quot;, a fictional diary covering Flores Magon&#x27;s life from his birth in Oaxaca until his mysterious death in his cell at Leavenworth.

In 1997, an organization of indigenous peoples of Mexico in the state of Oaxaca formed the Popular Indigenous Council of Oaxaca &quot;Ricardo Flores Magón&quot; (&quot;Consejo Indígena Popular de Oaxaca &quot;Ricardo Flores Magón&quot;&quot;, or CIPO-RFM), based on the philosophy of Magón.

== Playwright ==
In his work of popular education, Ricardo Flores Magón also used the theater to denounce the faults of society and outline the main lines of the libertarian &quot;program&quot;. He is the author of two plays: &quot;Verdugos et victimas&quot; and &quot;Tierra y Libertad&quot;. He is also the author of numerous tales, published in the newspaper &quot;Regeneración&quot;.

<text>In physics, lattice gauge theory is the study of gauge theories on a spacetime that has been discretized into a lattice.

Gauge theories are important in particle physics, and include the prevailing theories of elementary particles: quantum electrodynamics, quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and particle physics&#x27; Standard Model. Non-perturbative gauge theory calculations in continuous spacetime formally involve evaluating an infinite-dimensional path integral, which is computationally intractable. By working on a discrete spacetime, the path integral becomes finite-dimensional, and can be evaluated by stochastic simulation techniques such as the Monte Carlo method. When the size of the lattice is taken infinitely large and its sites infinitesimally close to each other, the continuum gauge theory is recovered.

==Basics==
In lattice gauge theory, the spacetime is Wick rotated into Euclidean space and discretized into a lattice with sites separated by distance formula_1 and connected by links. In the most commonly considered cases, such as lattice QCD, fermion fields are defined at lattice sites (which leads to fermion doubling), while the gauge fields are defined on the links. That is, an element &quot;U&quot; of the compact Lie group &quot;G&quot; (not algebra) is assigned to each link. Hence, to simulate QCD with Lie group SU(3), a 3×3 unitary matrix is defined on each link. The link is assigned an orientation, with the inverse element corresponding to the same link with the opposite orientation. And each node is given a value in formula_2 (a color 3-vector, the space on which the fundamental representation of SU(3) acts), a bispinor (Dirac 4-spinor), an &quot;nf&quot; vector, and a Grassmann variable.

Thus, the composition of links&#x27; SU(3) elements along a path (i.e. the ordered multiplication of their matrices) approximates a path-ordered exponential (geometric integral), from which Wilson loop values can be calculated for closed paths.

==Yang–Mills action==
The Yang–Mills action is written on the lattice using Wilson loops (named after Kenneth G. Wilson), so that the limit formula_3 formally reproduces the original continuum action. Given a faithful irreducible representation ρ of &quot;G&quot;, the lattice Yang–Mills action, known as the Wilson action, is the sum over all lattice sites of the (real component of the) trace over the &quot;n&quot; links &quot;e&quot;1, ..., &quot;e&quot;n in the Wilson loop,

:formula_4

Here, χ is the character. If ρ is a real (or pseudoreal) representation, taking the real component is redundant, because even if the orientation of a Wilson loop is flipped, its contribution to the action remains unchanged.

There are many possible Wilson actions, depending on which Wilson loops are used in the action. The simplest Wilson action uses only the 1×1 Wilson loop, and differs from the continuum action by &quot;lattice artifacts&quot; proportional to the small lattice spacing formula_1. By using more complicated Wilson loops to construct &quot;improved actions&quot;, lattice artifacts can be reduced to be proportional to formula_6, making computations more accurate.

==Measurements and calculations==
Quantities such as particle masses are stochastically calculated using techniques such as the Monte Carlo method. Gauge field configurations are generated with probabilities proportional to formula_7, where formula_8 is the lattice action and formula_9 is related to the lattice spacing formula_1. The quantity of interest is calculated for each configuration, and averaged. Calculations are often repeated at different lattice spacings formula_1 so that the result can be extrapolated to the continuum, formula_3.

Such calculations are often extremely computationally intensive, and can require the use of the largest available supercomputers. To reduce the computational burden, the so-called quenched approximation can be used, in which the fermionic fields are treated as non-dynamic &quot;frozen&quot; variables. While this was common in early lattice QCD calculations, &quot;dynamical&quot; fermions are now standard. These simulations typically utilize algorithms based upon molecular dynamics or microcanonical ensemble algorithms.

The results of lattice QCD computations show e.g. that in a meson not only the particles (quarks and antiquarks), but also the &quot;fluxtubes&quot; of the gluon fields are important.

==Quantum triviality==
Lattice gauge theory is also important for the study of quantum triviality by the real-space renormalization group. The most important information in the RG flow are what&#x27;s called the &quot;fixed points&quot;.

The possible macroscopic states of the system, at a large scale, are given by this set of fixed points. If these fixed points correspond to a free field theory, the theory is said to be &quot;trivial&quot; or noninteracting. Numerous fixed points appear in the study of lattice Higgs theories, but the nature of the quantum field theories associated with these remains an open question.

Triviality has yet to be proven rigorously, but lattice computations 
have provided strong evidence for this. This fact is important as quantum triviality can be used to bound or even predict parameters such as the mass of Higgs boson. Lattice calculations have been useful in this context.

==Other applications==

Originally, solvable two-dimensional lattice gauge theories had already been introduced in 1971 as models with interesting statistical properties by the theorist Franz Wegner, who worked in the field of phase transitions.

When only 1×1 Wilson loops appear in the action, lattice gauge theory can be shown to be exactly dual to spin foam models.

<text>The Skrulls () are a race of extraterrestrial shapeshifters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. They first appeared in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #2 and were created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. They originated from the planet Skrullos and their empire is located in the Andromeda Galaxy. Their infiltration of Earth was a major event in the Marvel Comics universe as shown in the crossover event &quot;Secret Invasion&quot;.

The Skrulls have made numerous appearances in animated television and video games before making their live-action cinematic debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; (2019). Skrulls have also appeared in &quot;Spider-Man: Far From Home&quot; (2019) and the Disney+ series &quot;WandaVision&quot;, &quot;What If...?&quot; (both 2021) and &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; (2023), and the film &quot;The Marvels&quot; (2023).

==Publication history==
The Skrulls first appeared in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #2 and were created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. The Skrulls next appear in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #18. The four who impersonated the members of the Fantastic Four next appear in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #92. The concept of the Skrulls would be explored and used throughout multiple storylines, spin-off comics, and derivative projects.

==Fictional history==
Millions of years ago, in the main Marvel continuity, the Celestials perform genetic experiments on the reptilian ancestors of the Skrulls, resulting in three branches of Skrulls: the Prime, the Deviants, and the Eternals. Eventually, the three branches battled with one another and the Deviant branch – due to possessing the innate ability to shapeshift – were triumphant, and wiped out all members of the other two races until only two were left: the Skrull Eternal Kly&#x27;bn, and the Prime Skrull of the original non-Deviant Skrull race. Kly&#x27;bn implored them to spare his life, as killing him would kill part of their heritage. The Deviants&#x27; leader Sl&#x27;gur&#x27;t eventually fell in love with Kly&#x27;bn, with the two eventually becoming the gods of the Skrull pantheon. Taking the name the Prime Skrull, the last original Skrull escaped to Earth in the 20th century and later became a member of the Underground Legion. From that point on, the Skrulls began to expand their territory. The Deviant branch later split into two more groups, the modern Skrulls and an anomaly called the Dire Wraiths.

The Skrulls originated from the planet Skrullos, and were originally a mercantile civilization, primarily interested in free trade and willing to share their technology with all races they deemed worthy. When they encountered a new race, they simply transformed themselves to resemble that race. The Skrull Empire that resulted from these contacts was based on free trade and mutual cooperation.

===Kree–Skrull War===

Eventually, the Skrulls developed long-distance space travel; a great tour of the universe was undertaken, led by Emperor Dorrek. Finally, the Skrull delegation reached the planet Hala, home to the then-barbaric Kree and the peaceful Cotati, and held a contest to determine which of the races would represent Hala to the Skrull Empire. Seventeen members of each race were taken to different uninhabited planetoids, where they were left with sufficient supplies for one year. At the end of that period, whichever group had done the most with themselves would be adjudged the most worthy. The Kree were taken to Earth&#x27;s Moon where they built a great city, while the Cotati were taken to another barren world in a different solar system and used their abilities to create a beautiful park. Realizing that the Cotati were going to win, the enraged Kree killed all of them. When the Kree revealed that they had solved the question of who would represent Hala to the Skrulls by destroying their opposition, the Skrull delegates were appalled and vowed that Hala would forever be banned from their circle of favored worlds—so the Kree massacred them as well, took over the Skrull landing spaceship by force, and developed their own technology from it.

Because of the immense distances involved, decades passed before the Skrulls learned of the Kree&#x27;s activities. By this time, however, it was too late. The Kree were now advanced and audacious enough to attack the Skrulls in their home galaxy. During the millennia that followed, the Kree aggression forced the Skrulls to become a militaristic civilization, and the Skrulls eventually developed the vicious streak needed to conduct intergalactic war. Their entire culture was remade in the warrior image. The Kree–Skrull War continued for thousands of years with only brief interruptions. The Skrull Throneworld is later moved from Skrullos to the more central Tarnax IV, with their empire encompassing over fifty worlds. The Skrulls also created the first Cosmic Cube, which later became the Shaper of Worlds; the Shaper related that, upon attaining self-awareness, he lashed out blindly, destroying two-thirds of the Skrull Empire and casting the civilization back into barbarism (suggesting this occurred before the war with the Kree broke out).

The Kree Accuser Ronan had wrested control of the Kree Empire from the Supreme Intelligence and attacked the Skrulls, reigniting hostilities. The Avengers become involved once the Super-Skrull kidnapped Captain Marvel and, in turn, they battled a Kree Sentry robot, three of the four original Skrulls that had fought the Fantastic Four, S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, rogue Inhumans and legions of Skrulls. The Supreme Intelligence ended the conflict by revealing to the Avengers&#x27; ally Rick Jones that he had vast mental potential, which was then used to freeze all combatants in place. The Supreme Intelligence announced that, while the Kree and Skrulls had reached genetic dead ends, the human race displayed incredible untapped potential. It is revealed years later that the conflict produced a Kree-Skrull hybrid, Hulkling, who was the child of one-time lovers Captain Marvel and Skrull princess Anelle.

===Empire-changing events===
The Skrulls became aware of Earth when they discovered a space warp linking Earth and Throneworld. Later, they discovered Earth possesses an equidistant link to Hala. They see Earth as a world to conquer, but they are content to hold off a full invasion. Because of their caution, the Skrulls have sent only a handful of scout warriors to infiltrate Earth, but failed to take into account the presence of the modern superhero.

In 1958, Skrulls attempted to sabotage Earth&#x27;s space program. They battled the 3-D Man, and set the Cold Warrior against the 3-D Man. Later, a small scouting party used their shape-shifting powers to impersonate the Fantastic Four, committing crimes so the country would turn against the Fantastic Four, the only ones with the power to stop them at the time. But the Fantastic Four were able to locate the Skrulls and tricked their leaders into believing the Earth was full of threats. The fleet left and Mr. Fantastic made three of the four Skrulls that were left behind shape-shift into cows and he hypnotized them to remember nothing about their true heritage.

In retaliation, the Skrull Emperor Dorrek VII dispatched Kl&#x27;rt, a Skrull who was made into the Super-Skrull, to Earth to defeat the Fantastic Four. Kl&#x27;rt possessed the combined powers of the entire Fantastic Four (in addition to shape-shifting and hypnotism), and he held the team at bay until Mister Fantastic discovered the source of his power and used a miniature device to jam the ray, before the Human Torch imprisoned him inside a crater. The Super-Skrull posed as Franklin Storm after transporting him to the Skrull Throneworld and battled the Fantastic Four as the Invincible Man. Another Skrull killed Storm by attaching a bomb to his chest before he was transported back. The Fantastic Four later traveled to Tarnax IV and found the Skrull responsible for Franklin&#x27;s murder (which turned out to be the Skrull Warlord Morrat). Skrulls were involved in other events, such as sending the Super-Skrull to battle Captain Mar-Vell, and abducting the Thing as a contestant in the Skrull Games.

Later, the cosmic being Uatu the Watcher adjudicates a duel between champions from both races: Colonel Bel-Dann of the Kree and Warlord Raksor of the Skrulls. After one year of conflict, the duel remained deadlocked and was ultimately abandoned, with no resolution. Years later, during a conflict with Xandar that included the Fantastic Four and the Champions of Xandar, Emperor Dorrek VII&#x27;s wife Empress R&#x27;klll staged a coup and killed him to become ruling Empress.

Empress R&#x27;klll&#x27;s reign was short-lived, however, as the greatest blow to the Skrulls arrived in the form of the World Devourer Galactus. After his Herald Nova annihilated the Skrull fleet, Galactus devoured Tarnax IV, killing 7 billion Skrulls, including R&#x27;klll and Princess Anelle. With the destruction of the central government, the Skrull Empire collapsed into hundreds of bickering factions. Their galaxy was filled with Governors who declared themselves to be Emperor of the Skrulls and soon, a civil war began. The Shi&#x27;ar maintained a heavy presence in the former Empire as well, constantly dealing with pockets of resistance.

===Second Kree–Skrull War===
Later, Reed Richards discovered that yet another Governor-turned-Emperor, Zabyk, had created a genetics bomb, which, when it exploded, made all the Skrulls lose their shapeshifting abilities. Whatever form they were in, they were stuck in at the time of the explosion.

In desperation, since without their powers they were vulnerable, they managed to kidnap the herald of Galactus Nova in an attempt to get Galactus to destroy Kree worlds for them. Their plot failed when the Silver Surfer helped Galactus rescue Nova in exchange for his freedom from Earth.

When the Celestials made an appearance, this scared the Skrulls into starting a second war with the Kree to show they were not powerless. The attack was first made by Kylor, one of five governors claiming to be Emperor. He had a spy in the Kree Empire, Nenora, who gave him the early edge. They tried to hide their secret weakness at all costs from the Kree.

Kylor was eventually betrayed by Nenora, as was the entire Skrull race. She assumed power of the Empire and wished to keep it for herself. It was Empress S&#x27;byll who stepped up to control the Skrulls and finish the war. She was able to resurrect the Super-Skrull and he returned to find the empire in shambles. They tricked the Silver Surfer into attacking a Badoon fleet, which he was not aware were allied with the Kree. Since the Kree waged war on the Surfer, he allied himself with the Skrulls to save Zenn-La from destruction.

To restore their powers, the Super-Skrull&#x27;s DNA needed to be transferred to S&#x27;byll, because only a female could spread the ability to the other Skrulls. The Surfer helped them to power a machine that would return the Empress&#x27; shape-shifting abilities. The device was successful. With this power, she was able to restore every Skrull she touched and became the true Empress of the Skrulls.

She and the Super-Skrull waged war with the Kree with the help of the Silver Surfer. She replaced the Super-Skrull with Captain Reptyl and he helped to change her into an emotionless reptile. But Reptyl was betrayed by one of his own and the Skrull fleet was utterly destroyed by the Kree. S&#x27;byll and the Silver Surfer went alone to attack the Kree homeworld of Hala.

Gaining the knowledge that Nenora was actually a Skrull gave them the advantage. S&#x27;byll gave her shape-shifting abilities back to her, crippling her and showing the Kree her true self. A peace treaty was created.

The Skrulls eventually broke that peace treaty, as they kept their military drive and prefer to fight rather than negotiate. Among the other races contained within the Skrull Empire are the Druff, Guna, Kallusina, Morani, Pheragot, Queega, Tekton, and Yirbek races. Other races remain independent, whether through treaties or open resistance. Such races include the Clegrimites, Gegku, Krylorians, Wilameanis, and Xandarians. The Skrull-Xandarian war with the Xandarians ended with Nebula destroying Xandar.

===Other activities===
Skrulls are, meanwhile, involved in numerous other activities. They were revealed to have conquered a medieval planet and abandoned it after its inhabitants perished. Skrull Prime Ten battled the Fantastic Four and Captain Mar-Vell. The Skrulls sent their own representative to witness the fate of the Phoenix, at her trial by the Shi&#x27;ar. There is a lone appearance of Queen Akilll of the Skrulls. A lone Skrull poisoned Vera Gantor to force the Avengers to seek the Resurrection Stone on his behalf. The Skrulls sent General Zedrao to give the dying Captain Mar-Vell the Royal Skrull Medal of Honor. The Skrulls had captured a Kree spy, Tel-Kar, who had infiltrated into the Skrulls by using a symbiote.

===Warskrulls===
A group of genetically-bred Skrulls called the Warskrulls began infiltrating the Shi&#x27;ar Empire. They used a Nexus Amplifier to assume total physical discorporation of their targets, adopting their superpowers along with their physical appearance. They captured and replaced the Starjammers with members of their race, as well as key components in government. The Warskrulls, acting under the direction of the paramount among them, posing as a Shi&#x27;ar called the Chamberlain, began committing murders and even genocide upon various Shi&#x27;ar affiliated races, such as the P!ndyr, in the name of the Shi&#x27;ar Empire. One Warskrull replaced the Imperial Consort, Professor X, called himself Warlord, and took mental control over Lilandra Neramani, the Majestrix of the Shi&#x27;ar. They were eventually defeated by the combined forces of Deathbird and the X-Men and later the Shi&#x27;ar vowed to weed out any other Warskrulls.

===Infiltrating Earth===
Some time later, a Skrull called Paibok the Power Skrull mounted a campaign to invade Earth, using another Skrull called Lyja as an infiltrator. The plan involved secretly replacing the real Alicia Masters, the Thing&#x27;s blind lover. The plan fell through when she instead seduced the Human Torch and the two eventually married one another. The long-running facade eventually came to light and the group discovered that the real, human Alicia was actually being held captive by the Skrull nation and Lyja defected, having fallen in love with the Human Torch. The Fantastic Four rescued her, but Lyja seemingly died in the process as she sacrificed herself to save Johnny when Paibok attacked.

Paibok later revealed to Devos the Devastator that she was still alive. Paibok, with the assistance of Devos, awoke Lyja from her comatose state and gave her the power to fly and fire energy blasts from her hands (she called herself &quot;Lyja the Lazerfist&quot;). These powers were later revealed to come from a special device implanted in her. Joining them in search of vengeance, the three arrived on Earth, and battled the Torch at Empire State University. The Torch panicked, used his nova flame and destroyed the campus. Alongside Devos and Paibok, Lyja witnessed a battle between the Fantastic Four and an alternate Fantastic Four. However, Lyja still bore feelings for the Torch and once again betrayed her cohorts to side with the Fantastic Four. This ended with the Fantastic Four destroying the &quot;Skrull War World&quot;, the Skrulls&#x27; largest attack ship.

===Cadre K===
A group of Skrulls traveled to Earth, where they began plotting to invade the planet once again. They were, however, at some point approached by Apocalypse, who wanted to lure together 12 powerful mutants that he needed to ascend to godhood. At the same time, the body of the Living Monolith, who had been hurled out into the far reaches of space by Thor, is found and brought back to Earth. On Earth, a mutant Skrull named Fiz snuck into Xavier&#x27;s mansion to tell them urgent news of trouble: the Skrulls have allied themselves with someone powerful and the only thing he knows is that there are 12 mutants that cannot be harmed and that something terrible is going to happen. Fiz also reveals the existence of a subtype of Skrulls that possess innate powers like Earth&#x27;s mutants. Deemed outcasts by the other Skrulls, they were hunted by the Empire.

After the eventual defeat of Apocalypse, Professor X went into space to train them, giving them the name Cadre K. Cadre K and Xavier returned to Earth during the Ruul&#x27;s attempt to overtake the planet by turning it into an intergalactic prison. A wounded Z&#x27;Cann attempted to pass on vital information to Rogue. Their physical contact affected Rogue&#x27;s powers for some time. The information was received and the X-Men were reunited with Bishop.

===&quot;Annihilation&quot;===
The Skrull Empire is the first of the major interstellar empires to be invaded by the forces of Annihilus. The Annihilation Wave&#x27;s superweapon, the Harvester of Sorrow, physically destroys dozens of Skrull planets. In the aftermath, the Skrulls unsuccessfully attempt to convince Hulkling to become their new Emperor.

===The Rise and Fall of the Shi&#x27;ar Empire===
A group of Warskrulls attacked a remote Shi&#x27;ar space station and took it over. Disguised as Shi&#x27;ar, they were taken aboard the space station willingly and slaughtered all those aboard, except a few needed to keep working the ship. The group, however was eventually defeated by a group of X-Men (Darwin, Havok, Marvel Girl, Nightcrawler, Professor X, and Warpath). These Warskrulls are, however, revealed to be cyborgs.

===&quot;Secret Invasion&quot;===
In &quot;Secret Invasion&quot;, a flailing Skrull Empire, under the leadership of newcomer Queen Veranke, made an all-out effort to infiltrate and conquer Earth. It was revealed that the Skrulls had infiltrated Earth by capturing and replacing many of Earth&#x27;s heroes. They followed this infiltration with their main assault group. This wave of Skrulls then formed new versions of the Super-Skrull, with each possessing the abilities of several different heroes. Their invasion ultimately failed, costing the life of Veranke, and reducing their numbers even further. Even their gods were slain, and the god Amatsu-Mikaboshi took over their Pantheon, leading to the events of &quot;Chaos War&quot;.

===Re-establishing the Empire and &quot;Infinity&quot;===
After the events of &quot;Secret Invasion&quot;, the Skrulls, now reduced in numbers, became very segmented with various factions rising up around Warlords that began plotting to rise back to power by orchestrating events for their own benefit.

During the &quot;Infinity&quot; storyline, several planets that the Skrulls settled on began being targeted by the Builders and while the Silver Surfer tried to save most of them, the Skrulls&#x27; population was once more decimated. Kl&#x27;rt the Super-Skrull later represented the Skrull Empire as a member of the Galactic Council. After the Avengers&#x27; victory over the Builders and Thanos, Kl&#x27;rt becomes the new Emperor of the Skrulls, where they settle on Tarnax II.

Meanwhile, Cadre K had settled on a ranch in South Dakota, while another group of Skrulls remain undercover on Earth as the &quot;Warner&quot; family, who are gathering data for the next Skrull invasion. The Warner family participate in day-to-day life, but end up stranded on Earth, completely cut off from the Empire.

===&quot;Infinity Countdown&quot;===
During the search of the Infinity Stones in the &quot;Infinity Countdown&quot; storyline, Razor reveals the true origin of the Tree of Shadows; according to Razor, the Tree of Shadows was created eons ago by one of the Elders of the Universe known as the Gardener, who tried to bring life to the Null Space and planted it in the Darkforce Dimension. Eventually the Null Space and the Tree of Shadows were discovered by a more prehistoric version of the Shi&#x27;ar and the Skrulls, a find that erupted in a war between the two alien races. The war raged until one member of the Shi&#x27;ar was able to grasp one of the seeds of the Tree. His physiology, fear and beliefs shaped the birth of the most vicious killing machine the universe had ever seen, the first Raptor and while the Skrulls, being shape-shifters, were still able to hold out against the Shi&#x27;ar, they eventually were nevertheless slaughtered by Raptor Prime, a creature of instinct and adaptation which quickly learnt to use their enemies&#x27; shape-shifting abilities as well.

===Empyre===
In the &quot;Road to Empyre,&quot; Teddy Altman is made a mysterious offer at the cost of leaving Billy Kaplan. He accepts the offer which was to become the new ruler of the Kree-Skrull Alliance, adopting the mantle of &quot;Dorrek VIII,&quot; and beginning the preparations of invading the Earth for &quot;the final war.&quot;

General G&#x27;iah, under the alias of &quot;Gloria Warner&quot;, sends an encrypted message to the Skrull High Command about the progress of Project Blossom. Her mate, Colonel Klrr, uses the alias of &quot;Carl Warner&quot; and they have three daughters named Alice, Ivy, and Madison. After losing her husband to their handler and rescuing Ivy, General G&#x27;iah obtains a sample of a Cotati from a lab while explaining the history of the Kree and the Skrull&#x27;s feud. At their motel, they are ambushed by a Kree operative. General G&#x27;iah leads her daughters to track the assailant to a Kree family. After G&#x27;iah&#x27;s daughters prevent her from retaliating against them, the patriarch of the Kree family that blew up their motel room suddenly receives a message on his Kree-tech cellphone by Dorrek VIII, stating to all Kree and Skrull soldiers in the field that the Kree and Skrull armadas have united to face a common enemy. They are coming to Earth to destroy them as he speaks. The enemy is eventually revealed to be the Cotati, who are returning, as well as the Celestial Messiah. In the Kree/Skrull Alliance, Dorekk VIII has gained Captain Glory, Mur-G&#x27;nn, Tanalth the Pursuer, and the Super-Skrull as his inner circle. When the Avengers learned about the Cotati&#x27;s true motives, they decided to work together to fight the Cotati and prevent them from eliminating all animal life. As Dorekk VII allows Black Panther to wield the Sword of Space, Captain Glory has a private chat with Tanalth the Pursuer and his scans reveal that she is not a Kree. It is revealed that Tanalth the Pursuer is actually Empress R&#x27;Klll in disguise, having survived the destruction of Tarnax IV.

==Biology==
Skrulls are green-skinned reptilian humanoids with large pointed ears, red or green eyes, and chins with several vertical folds in the skin below their mouths. Skrulls are known for genetic and molecular instability and genetic diversity, due to Celestial experimentation creating the Skrull Deviants. The Skrulls are known for their physical malleability and ability to shapeshift to any size, shape, or color at will, taking on the appearance but not the characteristics of other beings and objects. Skrulls are able to assume virtually any form, be it organic (e.g., cows ) or inorganic (e.g., lamps ). As a result, the Skrulls excel at spying and infiltration. Skrulls are also able to use their shapeshifting abilities to form weapons (e.g., blades and clubs) with parts of their bodies, making them dangerous hand-to-hand combatants. Their sexual dimorphism is roughly the same of a human being, with the exception that the males are mostly bald and have no facial hair, while females have full head of greenish-black hair, but their sexual orientation is more complex, since they can change their genders at will. Indeed, Xavin once casually said that, for a Skrull, changing gender is comparable to a human being changing their hair color. As for their reproductive system, just like the other reptilians, the females do not give live birth, but instead lay eggs and the newborns are known as &quot;hatchlings&quot;. However, despite being reptilian, the females also possesses hair and mammary glands to nurture their newborn, just like a human being.

The Skrulls later developed the ability to render themselves undetectable when using their shapeshifting abilities, even from telepaths and those with superior senses. Reed Richards discovered a method to use technology to negate this ability and reveal a disguised Skrull&#x27;s true form.

Courtesy of their advanced technology, the Skrulls have also been able to augment their abilities in certain warriors, such as the Super-Skrull, Power Skrull and the Warskrulls—all elite groups who, with special encoding, are able to emulate the powers as well as the appearance of their biophysical templates or are bestowed entirely unique supertropical abilities all their own (in the case of Paibok).

The Skrulls have been shown to suffer from various diseases. Some Skrulls are born with a defect that makes them unable to shapeshift, however, this defect also enhances their strength to those Skrulls including Titannus, Talos and Raze. The Skrulls can also suffer from cancer, as shown with Kl&#x27;rt the Super-Skrull and Prince Klundirk. In an alternate universe, Skyppi suffered from a form of tuberculosis which was common to the Skrull species.

Just like the Kree, the Skrull were evolutionarily stagnant, unable to evolve. However, over the millennia Skrull mutants have been born with the K-gene (as opposed to the human mutant X-Gene), meaning that now this might not be the case anymore.

After a Skrull dies, they revert to their original form.

==Culture==
===Language===
The Skrull species speak a variety of languages and dialects, including: Skrullos, Skrullian, the Irdu dialect, the Tligi dialect and the Frti dialect. While the Prime Skrulls had their own language, however, it was forgotten as their species was extinct.

===Art===
Since the Skrulls are a warrior race, it is hard for them to grasp almost any kind of representational art.

===Religion===
The main Skrull religion is the &quot;Dard&#x27;van Sect&quot;, their &quot;True Faith&quot;, which worships Sl&#x27;gur&#x27;t and Kly&#x27;bn. It is unknown about the relation between Zorr&#x27;Kiri and the actual pantheon.

In &quot;Deadpool vs. Thanos&quot; #3, it is revealed that the Skrull equivalent of Hell is called the Shapeless Wastes.

==Other versions==
===Amalgam===
In Amalgam Comics, the Skrull are the native inhabitants of Mars (having amalgamated DC&#x27;s Green Martians with the Skrulls). Mister X (the Martian Manhunter and Professor X) is an example of a Martian Skrull.

===Earth X===
In the alternate universe limited series &quot;Earth X&quot;, Thanos dwelled in the Realm of the Dead with the entity Death. It is revealed his mother was a Skrull and Death used her secret to make him believe that Death was his mother.

===&quot;Hulk: The End&quot;===
In the one-shot issue &quot;&quot;, an alien Recorder robot tells an elderly Bruce Banner, the last human on the planet, that the death of the human race was widely celebrated throughout the universe, so much so that the Kree and the Skrulls settled their differences in celebration.

===Squadron Supreme===
The Skrullian Skymaster (real name Skymax) is a founding member of the Squadron Supreme and possesses abilities matching the Super-Skrull from Earth-616. The character first appeared in flashback in &quot;Squadron Supreme&quot; #1 (1989), and appeared in more detail in &quot;Squadron Supreme: New World Order&quot;.

On Earth-712, the Skrull Empire has been at war with the Kree Empire. In an attempt to end the bloodshed, the Skrull Empire created a means to imbue their soldiers with extraordinary powers to vanquish the Kree. Skymax was the first and the only soldier subjected to the experiments, because the World Devourer destroyed the Skrull homeworld. Sk&#x27;ym&#x27;x was in the vicinity of Earth when his starship malfunctioned. He was rescued by American astronaut Joe Ledger (who would later become Doctor Spectrum). Grateful for his rescue, Skymax gave Ledger a Power Prism, which Ledger used to become the costumed adventurer Doctor Spectrum, while Skymax became the costumed adventurer known as the Skrull. Skymax and Ledger both became founding members of the Squadron Supreme, and Skymax remained with the team until member Tom Thumb repaired his ship, allowing him to return to space. Skymax realized that the damage to his ship was beyond repair despite Tom Thumb&#x27;s efforts, and he chose to remain on Earth in secret, searching for any possibility of other Skrull survivors. Not finding any, Skymax concluded that he was indeed the last of his race; he remained on Earth.

After the Squadron Supreme returned from their adventures on Earth-616, the sorcerer Mysterium sent the surviving members to retrieve others to help in the rebellion against the Global Directorate. Doctor Spectrum was sent after &quot;the Watcher&quot; and discovered Skymax. Renaming himself the Skrullian Skymaster and revealing his true origin to Doctor Spectrum, Skymax rejoined the Squadron Supreme and settled with them on Utopia Isle.

In the 2021 &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; reality, the Skrullian Skymaster was established as a former member of the Squadron Supreme of America. While trying to break up the protests caused by mutants over a bill that would start the Mutant Registration Act, the Skrullian Skymaster killed Mystique with his flame attacks. This caused Rogue to use her life-draining powers to avenge her adoptive mother by killing the Skrullian Skymaster.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the &quot;Ultimate Marvel&quot; reality, Skrulls are led by the billion-year-old Skrull Emperor Kl&#x27;rt, as their off shoot Chitauri exist whom they call terrorists. They have extremely advanced technology, but have not been observed to shapeshift. These Skrulls were seen only in an alternate timeline in which Reed Richards contacted their world via his teleporter; the events leading to that timeline were altered in &quot;Ultimate Fantastic Four&quot; #29 so that contact was never made.

===MC2===
In the MC2 universe, Torus Storm, the son of Lyja and Johnny Storm, is a Skrull/Human hybrid, who inherited the powers of both his parents.

===Thirty years into the future===
In an alternate timeline set 30 years into the future, the Skrull Empire was united with the Kree Empire under the rulership of Emperor Dorrek VIII and they were successful in eliminating all life on Earth.

===&quot;What If?&quot;===
====&quot;Secret Invasion&quot;====
On Earth-10021, the Skrulls were victorious in the end of &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; and the heroes were defeated. In this reality, the Skrulls were coexisting along with the humans on Earth and were seen by humans as people with good intentions. Despite helping the humans in medical care and technology, in reality, they are secretly turning the humans into Skrulls like themselves, including Norman Osborn, who had married Queen Veranke, while the heroes had been hiding in Wakanda, since now they were seen as criminals. In the end, the heroes spread a virus which killed every Skrull and the humans who had been turned into Skrulls, except for Osborn, who had been disguised as Iron Man. Osborn revealed that he had orchestrated the plan all along, but he was killed by Bucky Barnes. The heroes were then taken by the U.S. government as world criminals.

Talos tells Fury that following the Blip, he summoned one million Skrull refugees to live on Earth. Angry that Fury failed in his promise to take care of them, Gravik orchestrates several terrorist attacks across many continents, kills Hill, Talos, and other Skrulls who try to rebel against him, and attempts to instigate World War III.

<text>Warped product formula_1 of two Riemannian (or pseudo-Riemannian) manifolds formula_2 and formula_3 with respect to a function formula_4 is the product space formula_5 with the metric tensor formula_6.

Warped geometries are useful in that separation of variables can be used when solving partial differential equations over them.

==Examples==
Warped geometries acquire their full meaning when we substitute the variable &quot;y&quot; for &quot;t&quot;, time and &quot;x&quot;, for &quot;s&quot;, space. Then the &quot;f&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) factor of the spatial dimension becomes the effect of time that in words of Einstein &quot;curves space&quot;. How it curves space will define one or other solution to a space-time world. For that reason, different models of space-time use warped geometries.
Many basic solutions of the Einstein field equations are warped geometries, for example, the Schwarzschild solution and the Friedmann–Lemaitre–Robertson–Walker models.

Also, warped geometries are the key building block of Randall–Sundrum models in string theory.

<doc id="671821" wikidata="Q1135677" url="?curid=671821" title="Randall–Sundrum model">
<text>In physics, Randall–Sundrum models (RS) (also called 5-dimensional warped geometry theory) are models that describe the world in terms of a warped-geometry higher-dimensional universe, or more concretely as a 5-dimensional anti-de Sitter space where the elementary particles (except the graviton) are localized on a (3 + 1)-dimensional brane or branes.

The two models were proposed in two articles in 1999 by Lisa Randall and Raman Sundrum because they were dissatisfied with the universal extra-dimensional models then in vogue. Such models require two fine tunings; one for the value of the bulk cosmological constant and the other for the brane tensions. Later, while studying RS models in the context of the anti-de Sitter / conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, they showed how it can be dual to technicolor models.

The first of the two models, called RS1, has a finite size for the extra dimension with two branes, one at each end. The second, RS2, is similar to the first, but one brane has been placed infinitely far away, so that there is only one brane left in the model.

==Overview==
The model is a braneworld theory developed while trying to solve the hierarchy problem of the Standard Model. It involves a finite five-dimensional bulk that is extremely warped and contains two branes: the Planckbrane (where gravity is a relatively strong force; also called &quot;Gravitybrane&quot;) and the Tevbrane (our home with the Standard Model particles; also called &quot;Weakbrane&quot;). In this model, the two branes are separated in the not-necessarily large fifth dimension by approximately 16 units (the units based on the brane and bulk energies). The Planckbrane has positive brane energy, and the Tevbrane has negative brane energy. These energies are the cause of the extremely warped spacetime.

==Graviton probability function==
In this warped spacetime that is &quot;only&quot; warped along the fifth dimension, the graviton&#x27;s probability function is extremely high at the Planckbrane, but it drops exponentially as it moves closer towards the Tevbrane. In this, gravity would be much weaker on the Tevbrane than on the Planckbrane.

==RS1 model==
The RS1 model attempts to address the hierarchy problem. The warping of the extra dimension is analogous to the warping of spacetime in the vicinity of a massive object, such as a black hole. This warping, or red-shifting, generates a large ratio of energy scales, so that the natural energy scale at one end of the extra dimension is much larger than at the other end:

:formula_1

where &quot;k&quot; is some constant, and η has &quot;−+++&quot; metric signature. This space has boundaries at &quot;y&quot; = 1/&quot;k&quot; and &quot;y&quot; = 1/(&quot;Wk&quot;), with formula_2, where &quot;k&quot; is around the Planck scale, &quot;W&quot; is the warp factor, and &quot;Wk&quot; is around a TeV. The boundary at &quot;y&quot; = 1/&quot;k&quot; is called the Planck brane, and the boundary at &quot;y&quot; = 1/(&quot;Wk&quot;) is called the TeV brane. The particles of the standard model reside on the TeV brane. The distance between both branes is only −ln(&quot;W&quot;)/&quot;k&quot;, though.

In another coordinate system,

and

:formula_5

==RS2 model==
The RS2 model uses the same geometry as RS1, but there is no TeV brane. The particles of the standard model are presumed to be on the Planck brane. This model was originally of interest because it represented an infinite 5-dimensional model, which, in many respects, behaved as a 4-dimensional model. This setup may also be of interest for studies of the AdS/CFT conjecture.

==Prior models==
In 1998/99 Merab Gogberashvili published on arXiv a number of articles on a very similar theme. He showed that if the Universe is considered as a thin shell (a mathematical synonym for &quot;brane&quot;) expanding in 5-dimensional space, then there is a possibility to obtain one scale for particle theory corresponding to the 5-dimensional cosmological constant and Universe thickness, and thus to solve the hierarchy problem. It was also shown that four-dimensionality of the Universe is the result of stability requirement, since the extra component of the Einstein field equations giving the localized solution for matter fields coincides with the one of the conditions of stability.

==Experimental results==
In August 2016, experimental results from the LHC excluded RS gravitons with masses below 3.85 and 4.45 TeV for ˜k = 0.1 and 0.2 respectively and for ˜k = 0.01, graviton masses below 1.95 TeV, except for the region between 1.75 TeV and 1.85 TeV. Currently, the most stringent limits on RS graviton production.

<text>Mahesh Shrinivas Bhupathi (born 7 June 1974) is an Indian former doubles world No. 1 tennis player. In 1997, he became the first Indian to win a major tournament (with Rika Hiraki). With his win at the 2006 Australian Open mixed doubles, he joined the elite group of eight tennis players who have achieved a career Grand Slam in mixed doubles. He is also the founder of International Premier Tennis League. In December 2016, Bhupathi was appointed as India&#x27;s next non-playing Davis Cup captain and took over the reins from Anand Amritraj in February 2017.

==Career==
===1995–2006===
Mahesh Bhupathi is considered one of the top doubles players of the 1990s and 2000s. In 1999, Bhupathi won three doubles titles with Leander Paes, including the French Open and Wimbledon. He and Paes became the first doubles team to reach the finals of all four Grand Slams, the first time such a feat has been achieved in the open era and the first time since 1952. On 26 April of that year, they became the world no. 1 doubles team. Bhupathi also won the US Open mixed doubles with Ai Sugiyama of Japan.

In 2006, Bhupathi teamed with Martina Hingis in the Australian Open mixed doubles competition. Entering the tournament unseeded and as wildcards, the first-time pair defeated four seeded opponents along the way, while only dropping a single set throughout. Bhupathi and Hingis defeated the sixth-seeded team of Daniel Nestor and Elena Likhovtseva in straight sets, 6–3, 6–3, to capture the championship. It was the sixth mixed doubles Grand Slam for Bhupathi, and the first one for Hingis. By winning the Australian Open, Bhupathi completed a career Grand Slam in mixed doubles.

===2007–2008===
In 2007, Bhupathi and Radek Štěpánek reached the 2007 Australian Open men&#x27;s doubles event&#x27;s quarterfinals. Bhupathi teamed with Štěpánek at the 2007 French Open to make the doubles semifinals, defeating two-year defending champions Jonas Björkman and Max Mirnyi in the quarterfinals. The team lost to the eventual champions Mark Knowles and Daniel Nestor. After Wimbledon, Bhupathi teamed with Pavel Vízner to win the 2007 Canada Masters, defeating the top-ranked doubles team Bob and Mike Bryan en route. After this victory, he won a tournament in New Haven with Nenad Zimonjić. At the 2007 US Open, he and Zimonjić paired in doubles. After the US Open, the team that beat Bhupathi and Štěpánek in the French Open semifinals, Knowles and Nestor, split up. Bhupathi became Knowles&#x27; partner, while Zimonjić became Nestor&#x27;s, but back surgery meant he was out until the end of the year.

===2009–2012===
In 2009, Bhupathi and compatriot Sania Mirza won the mixed doubles title at the Australian Open, beating Nathalie Dechy and Andy Ram, 6–3, 6–1, in the final. The Indian pair thus made up for the disappointment of the previous year&#x27;s final when they were beaten by Sun Tiantian and Nenad Zimonjić. With this win, Bhupathi&#x27;s count in mixed doubles Grand Slam titles increased to seven.

Bhupathi broke up his partnership with Knowles and began playing once again with Max Mirnyi, with whom he played to win the 2002 US Open. In 2011, Bhupathi reunited with former playing partner Leander Paes for the 2011 Australian Open. The team reached the final, but lost 3–6, 4–6 to the Bryan brothers. On 7 June 2012, Bhupathi and Sania Mirza won the French Open mixed doubles.
On 4 November 2012, Bhupathi and partner Rohan Bopanna won the Paris Masters cup. In spite of suffering a setback with their loss against Jonathan Marray and Frederik Nielsen in the ATP Tour Finals opener, the Indian duo reached the final round of the ATP Tour Finals, but suffered a defeat at the hands of Marcel Granollers and Marc López.

===2013===
Bhupathi and Bopanna played with different partners for the first three months of 2013, Bhupathi winning the tournament in Dubai in March with Michaël Llodra, but rejoined starting with the Monte-Carlo Masters.

==Playing style==
Mahesh Bhupathi is known for his strong serve. According to Rafael Nadal, his strong backhand makes him the best for an Ad Court player. Roger Federer acclaims him as one of the best doubles players of all time. He often discusses strategies between the serves with his partner during the match and also communicates using finger-at-the-back signals.

==Year-end finals==
Bhupathi appeared with Paes in six season finales. In 2011, they appeared, for the first time since 2002, after securing qualification in mid-October. Bhupathi played at the year-end championships with Paes from 1997 to 2000 and in 2002, reaching three finals. In 1997, they lost the final to Rick Leach and Jonathan Stark. They lost the 1999 final to Sébastien Lareau and Alex O’Brien. In 2000, they lost the final to Donald Johnson and Pieter Norval. Bhupathi also qualified with Max Mirnyi in 2003, 2004, and 2010, when they finished runners-up to Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjić. He appeared at the finals with Mark Knowles in 2008 and 2009. In 2012, he and Rohan Bopanna made it to the final, where they lost to Marcel Granollers and Marc López.

Paes and Bhupathi decided to team up again at the Australian Open 2011, ending a nine-year separation on the ATP circuit. They reached the finals of the event, but lost to American twins Bob and Mike Bryan. Paes stated at the time that the best thing has been to have their friendship back.

<text>In computing, aliasing describes a situation in which a data location in memory can be accessed through different symbolic names in the program. Thus, modifying the data through one name implicitly modifies the values associated with all aliased names, which may not be expected by the programmer. As a result, aliasing makes it particularly difficult to understand, analyze and optimize programs. Aliasing analysers intend to make and compute useful information for understanding aliasing in programs.

== Aliased pointers ==
Aliasing can occur in any language that can refer to one location in memory with more than one name (for example, with pointers). This is a common problem with functions that accept pointer arguments, and their tolerance (or the lack thereof) for aliasing must be carefully documented, particularly for functions that perform complex manipulations on memory areas passed to them.

== Specified aliasing ==
Controlled aliasing behaviour may be desirable in some cases (that is, aliasing behaviour that is specified, unlike that enabled by memory layout in C). It is common practice in Fortran. The Perl programming language specifies, in some constructs, aliasing behaviour, such as in loops. This allows certain data structures to be modified directly with less code. For example,
my @array = (1, 2, 3);

foreach my $element (@array) {
 # Increment $element, thus automatically
 # modifying @array, since $element is &quot;aliased&quot;
 # to each of @array&#x27;s elements in turn.
 $element++;

print &quot;@array \n&quot;;

will print out &quot;2 3 4&quot; as a result. If one wanted to bypass aliasing effects, one could copy the contents of the index variable into another and change the copy.

== Conflicts with optimization ==
Optimizers often have to make conservative assumptions about variables when aliasing is possible. For example, knowing the value of a variable (such as codice_1 is 5) normally allows certain optimizations (such as constant propagation). However, the compiler cannot use this information after an assignment to another variable (for example, in C, codice_2) because it could be that codice_3 is an alias of codice_1. This could be the case after an assignment like codice_5. As an effect of this assignment to codice_3, the value of codice_1 would be changed as well, so propagating the information that codice_1 is 5 to the statements following codice_2 would be potentially wrong (if codice_3 is indeed an alias of codice_1). However, if there is information about pointers, the constant propagation process could make a query like: can codice_1 be an alias of codice_3? Then, if the answer is no, codice_14 can be propagated safely.

Another optimization impacted by aliasing is code reordering. If the compiler decides that codice_1 is not aliased by codice_3, then code that uses or changes the value of codice_1 can be moved before the assignment codice_2, if this would improve scheduling or enable more loop optimizations to be carried out.

To enable such optimizations in a predictable manner, the ISO standard for the C programming language (including its newer C99 edition, see section 6.5, paragraph 7) specifies that it is illegal (with some exceptions) to access the same memory location using pointers of different types. A compiler may therefore assume that such pointers do not alias. This rule, known as the strict aliasing rule, sometimes allows for impressive increases in performance, but has been known to break some otherwise valid code. Several software projects intentionally violate this portion of the C99 standard. For example, Python 2.x did so to implement reference counting, and required changes to the basic object structs in Python 3 to enable this optimization. The Linux kernel does this because strict aliasing causes problems with optimization of inlined code. In such cases, when compiled with gcc, the option codice_19 is invoked to prevent unwanted optimizations that could yield unexpected code.

== Hardware aliasing ==
The term &quot;aliasing&quot; is also used to describe the situation where, due to either a hardware design choice or a hardware failure, one or more of the available address bits is not used in the memory selection process. This may be a design decision if there are more address bits available than are necessary to support the installed memory device(s). In a failure, one or more address bits may be shorted together, or may be forced to ground (logic 0) or the supply voltage (logic 1).

;Example
For this example, assuming a memory design with 8 locations, requiring only 3 address lines (or bits, since 23 = 8). Address bits (named A2 through A0) are decoded to select unique memory locations as follows, in standard binary counter fashion:
In the table above, each of the 8 unique combinations of address bits selects a different memory location. However, if one address bit (say A2) were to be shorted to ground, the table would be modified as follows:

In this case, with A2 always being zero, the first four memory locations are duplicated and appear again as the second four. Memory locations 4 through 7 have become inaccessible.

If this change occurred to a different address bit, the decoding results would be different, but in general the effect would be the same: the loss of a single address bit cuts the available memory space in half, with resulting duplication (aliasing) of the remaining space.

<doc id="671848" wikidata="Q3783556" url="?curid=671848" title="Hartley Castle">
<text>Hartley Castle was a castle near Kirkby Stephen, Cumbria, England.

==History==
The manor was confiscated circa 1315 from Roger de Clifford and granted to Andrew de Harcla (anglicized to Andrew de Harclay or Hartley). The name Harcla is thought to be from the Old English for &quot;hard ground&quot; and may refer to the outcrop of land that the castle is built upon in the Eden valley.

The existing manor house was fortified by de Harcla, some time prior to 1323, when he was ordered by King Edward II to be hanged, drawn and quartered for alleged collusion with Robert the Bruce, and forfeited his earldom and lands. It was granted to Ralph de Neville who later sold it through three other hands to Thomas de Musgrave who on 4 October 1353 was granted a licence to crenellate by King Edward III:
::&quot;mansum manerii ... Harcla quod prope Marchiam Scociae situatur et per Scotos inimicos nostros saepius ante haec tempora combustum extitit et destructum&quot;
:which roughly speaking says fortification was needed because
::&quot;Harcla is situated near the Scottish Marches and because our enemy the Scots have often burned and destroyed it.&quot;

It was improved during the 17th century with the addition in 1615 of a pair of wings but was abandoned circa 1677. Thomas Machel visited the castle in 1677 and described it as
An Elizabethan building consisting of an inner quadrangle surrounded by buildings, and an outer court to the north protected by a thick and high curtain wall. The entrance to it was approached through a gateway at the head of a flight of steps from the road. Directly opposite an archway opened into the inner court; on the left, or east side, was the kitchen and buttery, with the hall beyond, entered by an external stair from the court; the south end was occupied by the chapel and withdrawing rooms; whilst on the western side there was a long gallery lighted by a large oriel window facing the quadrangle

Another sketch from 1692 shows a thick, high curtain wall enclosing a square outer court, with an inner court enclosed by three and four storey buildings. The at right shows what remained by the beginning of the 18th century. It was demolished between 1704 and 1744 for building stone which was used to repair Edenhall. 

The castle layout appears to have been similar to Sudeley Castle in the Cotswolds, with its double courtyards separated by a low dividing wall and a central small door and its oriel-windowed hall, but without Sudeley&#x27;s later Southern Wing and with a curtain wall demarking the second courtyard instead.

==Today==

Apart from limited earthworks, all that remains now is a few metres of wall and stairs down to a vaulted cellar for the former kitchen. The site currently houses a late-18th-century farmhouse and outbuildings.

<text>The Brennisteinsalda () is a volcano in the south of Iceland. Its height is about 855 m. It is situated near Landmannalaugar and not far from Hekla.

The name means in English: &quot;sulphur wave&quot;. It comes from the sulphur spots which have coloured its sides. But there are other colours, too: green from mosses, black and blue from lava and ashes, red from iron in the earth. It could very well be the most colourful mountain of Iceland and so its picture is often found in books and calendars.

The mountain is still visibly an active volcano with hot sulphur springs and vapour at its sides. The hiking trail &quot;Laugavegur&quot; passes by. In front of it there is an obsidian lava field.

<text>Bláhnjúkur () is a volcano in the south of Iceland. Its height is 940 m.

Its name translates to &quot;blue peak&quot; in English. This comes from the blue-black colour of its sides. The colour is due to volcanic ash and lava flows.

The mountain is situated in Landmannalaugar, a natural park near Hekla. It lies next to the volcano Brennisteinsalda.

A hiking trail leads up to the top of the mountain from which, in good conditions, five glaciers are visible.

The best way to get to the peak is on road number F 208. You will need a 4x4 vehicle.

The hike is considered hard and takes 3-4 hours (6.8 miles) round-trip because of the steep inclines up (or down if you go counter-clockwise).

An easier trek is possible by climbing up to the peak and going back down the same way. The challenge with this way is that you will have to deal with the steep inclines up and back down.

<doc id="671867" wikidata="Q7282769" url="?curid=671867" title="Rag (student society)">
<text>Rags are student-run charitable fundraising organisations that are widespread in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Some are run as student societies whilst others sit with campaigns within their student unions. Most universities in the UK and Ireland, as well as some in the Netherlands and the Commonwealth countries of South Africa and Singapore have a rag. In some universities rags are known as Charities Campaigns, Charity Appeals, Charity Committees (or Kommittees), Jool or Karnivals, but they all share many attributes.

In the UK, the National Student Fundraising Association (NaSFA), set up in December 2011, exists as a support and resource sharing organisation run by those managing rags for others managing rags.

==Origins==

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; states that the origin of the word &quot;rag&quot; is from &quot;An act of ragging; esp. an extensive display of noisy disorderly conduct, carried on in defiance of authority or discipline&quot;, and provides a citation from 1864, noting that the word was known in Oxford before this date.

Rags flourished in the inter-war period, but were not always aimed at charity. The rivalry between University College London and King&#x27;s College London led to rags becoming running battles. In 1919, the visiting American prohibitionist William Johnson was kidnapped and subsequently lost an eye during a police rescue attempt, while in 1922 part of the balustrade in the King&#x27;s College quad was demolished during a battle with UCL students. As well as those in London, rags at Oxford and Cambridge were known for destruction of property and antisocial behaviour. The attack on Newnham College by over a thousand undergraduate men following a vote on degrees for women in 1921 was widely described as a &#x27;rag&#x27;.

In 1920 the &quot;Birmingham Daily Post&quot; noted the start of a shift to rags being charity events at Durham University: &quot;Durham University students have set a new standard in &#x27;rags,&#x27; for their programme yesterday was of a constructive rather than destructive type, and as the procession marched through the city a collection was taken for the hospital. This is a good example to the student world, and calculated to do more to commend culture to the people than those meaningless orgies which have taken place elsewhere in the past, to the destruction of property and the detriment of law and order.&quot; The following year, 1921, the University of Manchester rag collected money for local medical charities for the first time and students at Cambridge collected for the Haig Fund at a Poppy Day Rag,
while in 1923 students at King&#x27;s College London dressed as ancient Egyptians to raise money for the European War Relief Fund. Glasgow University Students&#x27; Unemployment Day, later the university&#x27;s Charities Week Appeal, started in 1922 and included publication of the &quot;Ygorra&quot; magazine, with proceeds going to city hospitals and the Lord Provost&#x27;s Fund for the Unemployed.

In South Africa, a rag was started at the University of Pretoria in the 1920s, and at the University of Witwatersrand in 1922, with charity collections starting in 1929.

More recently, backronyms have been invented for &quot;RAG&quot;, including &quot;raise and give&quot;, &quot;remember and give&quot; and &quot;raising and giving&quot;.

==Fundraising==

===Rag Week===

Traditionally fundraising activities have centred on an annual Rag Week, with events each day for the week. While some Rags are only active for this week, others use &quot;Rag Week&quot; as their flagship week to encourage participation for the whole year.

===Rag mag===
A rag mag is a small booklet traditionally filled with (now politically incorrect) humour which was sold to the local community during rag week. Possibly some university rags with a strong local tradition still sell their rag mags, however the majority of others use theirs more as information-tools for new students wanting to know more about rag.

An issue of a rag mag dating from 1923, called &quot;Goblio&quot;, is in the archives of the University of Southampton. The University of Manchester published its &quot;Red Rag&quot; in 1924, and provides digital access to a selection of early magazines. Sheffield University Rag&#x27;s &quot;Twikker&quot; was first produced in 1925. Queen&#x27;s University Belfast holds a fairly complete set of rag magazines in its archives, with 81 different copies of &quot;PTQ&quot; (&quot;Pro Tanto Quid&quot; – taken from the city&#x27;s motto &quot;&quot;Pro tanto quid retribuamus&quot;&quot;) from 1927.

===Sponsored challenges and fundraising events===

Many rags raise the majority of their money for charity through sponsored challenges and fundraising events. While these vary from University to University, typical examples of each include:

====Sponsored challenges====
* &quot;Jailbreaks&quot;, competitions to get as far from the start and back again within a set period of time, without spending any money on transport.
* Sponsored skydives
* Sponsored cycling events
* Running events including marathons, half marathons and &#x27;Tough Guy&#x27; challenges
* Climbing expeditions
* Sponsored hitch-hikes
* other sponsored game of sports

====Fundraising events====
* Pub crawls
* International Men&#x27;s Day parties
* World record attempts
* Bed-runs racing teams with hospital beds.
* Pub Quizzes
* Duck races

Manchester RAG also run one of the longest running sponsored events in the North West, known as The Bogle Stroll, which celebrated its semicentennial anniversary in 2011.

Exeter RAG hold the Biggest World AIDS Day event in the UK, called the Safer Sex Ball, Seeing Thousands of students attending to raise money for Charity, £20,000 of which is annually set aside for local AIDS charity the Eddistone Trust.

===Rag Raids===

Street Collections: Currently known as &#x27;Raids&#x27;, volunteer collectors go out into the streets (often in costume) to collect for a specific charity on any given day with buckets rather than the clipboards.
Many Rags also organise week-long &#x27;Tours&#x27; over the university holidays in which they will travel from town to town, collecting in each one, and raising thousands of pounds for the beneficiary charity.

Megaraids: A Megaraid is defined as a Raid where more than one Rag is present and in recent years these have been organised on a massive scale by charities with some events taking place consistently for over a decade. Charities which have a developed student fundraising events include Barnardo&#x27;s, Cancer Research UK, Help the Aged, Hope for Children, Kidscan, Meningitis UK, Meningitis Research Foundation, Meningitis Trust and Worldwide Cancer Research. All Megaraids tend to include a social aspect and often attract former students who still take part.

Carnival RAG, the University of Birmingham&#x27;s RAG, is one of the largest and most successful in the country, averaging over £200,000 a year for the last 3 years.

==National Student Fundraising Association (NaSFA)==
NaSFA is an association of UK student fundraising organisations. It stands for National Student Fundraising Association and was born out of a meeting of 15 heads of UK RAG organisations at the national Rag conference in Durham 2011. These presidents identified a real potential for dramatic increases in efficiency by sharing knowledge and resources. They lay down some fundamental principles, realised a need for a constant and impartial 3rd party facilitator and duly chose the NUS from a selection of applications to support the project.

The underlying aims of NaSFA, to foster sharing of resources, knowledge and support for and between student fundraising organisations have contributed to the 30 Rags involved.
In December 2011 the original NaSFA founders invited interested parties to an open meeting at the Union of Brunel Students, to ask for approval on what they had been working on and to give Ed Marsh, the vice-president of the NUS, a mandate to drive NUS support forwards through the organisation&#x27;s structure.

==Rag Conference (UK)==
An annual conference for Rag societies and charities is held in the UK. The conference is an opportunity for Rags, student fundraising organisations, charities and associated partners to come together to network, learn and socialise over three action-packed days. In 2012 the Rag conference was held at Loughborough University, and in 2013, the Rag conference was hosted by The University of Birmingham from the 2 to 5 September. In 2014, the conference was held at the University of York from 26 to 28 August. In 2019 it is due to be held in Birmingham after Carnival Rag won the bidding.

<doc id="671868" wikidata="Q7357016" url="?curid=671868" title="Rodney Mullen vs. Daewon Song">
<text>Rodney Mullen vs. Daewon Song is a skateboarding video series that features influential skateboarders Rodney Mullen and Daewon Song. Three video installments were released under the titles Round 1, Round 2, and (the third &quot;round&quot; was incorporated into the debut video for the Almost skateboard company that was cofounded by Mullen and Song).

==History==

===Round 1 (1997)===
The first video shows Mullen &quot;competing&quot; against Song—the two are close friends outside of the video series. The video also features combined parts from the World Industries, A-Team, and Blind teams (as they were in 1997 when the video was released). Song and Mullen both appear in their own parts that are combined with small sections that feature members of their respective brands&#x27; teams.

===Round 2 (1999)===
Compared to the first video, &quot;Round 2&quot; was produced in a slightly different format. As with &quot;Round 1&quot;, the video features individual parts from Mullen and Song, and there are also combined parts from the World Industries, A-Team, and Blind teams—some World team members had, by this time, formed the Deca brand. However, there are also short advertisement-like sections throughout the video for the other brands that were being distributed by Dwindle Distribution at the time, making the video similar to an issue of a video magazine.

===Round 3 (2004)===
As it is effectively an Almost video, the third installment is considerably different from its predecessors. &quot;Almost: Round Three&quot; not only includes Song and Mullen, but features full-length parts from the Almost team of the time: Chris Haslam, Cooper Wilt, Greg Lutzka, Ryan Sheckler, and &quot;William Patrick&quot;, who was really Tyrone Olson in a costume.

<doc id="671875" wikidata="Q3507963" url="?curid=671875" title="Conformal symmetry">
<text>Conformal symmetry is a property of spacetime that ensures angles remain unchanged even when distances are altered. If you stretch, compress, or otherwise distort spacetime, the local angular relationships between lines or curves stay the same. This idea extends the familiar Poincaré group —which accounts for rotations, translations, and boosts—into the more comprehensive conformal group.

Conformal symmetry encompasses special conformal transformations and dilations. In three spatial plus one time dimensions, conformal symmetry has 15 degrees of freedom: ten for the Poincaré group, four for special conformal transformations, and one for a dilation.

Harry Bateman and Ebenezer Cunningham were the first to study the conformal symmetry of Maxwell&#x27;s equations. They called a generic expression of conformal symmetry a spherical wave transformation. General relativity in two spacetime dimensions also enjoys conformal symmetry.

==Generators==

The Lie algebra of the conformal group has the following representation:

: formula_1

where formula_2 are the Lorentz generators, formula_3 generates translations, formula_4 generates scaling transformations (also known as dilatations or dilations) and formula_5 generates the special conformal transformations.

==Commutation relations==

The commutation relations are as follows:

: formula_6
other commutators vanish. Here formula_7 is the Minkowski metric tensor.

Additionally, formula_4 is a scalar and formula_5 is a covariant vector under the Lorentz transformations.

The special conformal transformations are given by
:formula_10
where formula_11 is a parameter describing the transformation. This special conformal transformation can also be written as formula_12, where
:formula_13 
which shows that it consists of an inversion, followed by a translation, followed by a second inversion.


In two-dimensional spacetime, the transformations of the conformal group are the conformal transformations. There are infinitely many of them.

In more than two dimensions, Euclidean conformal transformations map circles to circles, and hyperspheres to hyperspheres with a straight line considered a degenerate circle and a hyperplane a degenerate hypercircle.

In more than two Lorentzian dimensions, conformal transformations map null rays to null rays and light cones to light cones, with a null hyperplane being a degenerate light cone.

==Applications==

===Conformal field theory===
{{Main|Conformal field theory}}

In relativistic quantum field theories, the possibility of symmetries is strictly restricted by Coleman–Mandula theorem under physically reasonable assumptions. The largest possible global symmetry group of a non-supersymmetric interacting field theory is a direct product of the conformal group with an internal group. Such theories are known as conformal field theories.

{{expand section|date=March 2017}}

===Second-order phase transitions===
{{main|phase transitions}}

One particular application is to critical phenomena in systems with local interactions. Fluctuations{{clarify|of what?|date=March 2017}} in such systems are conformally invariant at the critical point. That allows for classification of universality classes of phase transitions in terms of conformal field theories.

{{expand section|date=March 2017}}

Conformal invariance is also present in two-dimensional turbulence at high Reynolds number.

===High-energy physics===

Many theories studied in high-energy physics admit conformal symmetry due to it typically being implied by local scale invariance. A famous example is d=4, N=4 supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory due its relevance for AdS/CFT correspondence. Also, the worldsheet in string theory is described by a two-dimensional conformal field theory coupled to two-dimensional gravity.

== Mathematical proofs of conformal invariance in lattice models ==

Physicists have found that many lattice models become conformally invariant in the critical limit. However, mathematical proofs of these results have only appeared much later, and only in some cases.

In 2010, the mathematician Stanislav Smirnov was awarded the Fields medal &quot;for the proof of conformal invariance of percolation and the planar Ising model in statistical physics&quot;.

In 2020, the mathematician Hugo Duminil-Copin and his collaborators proved that rotational invariance exists at the boundary between phases in many physical systems.

<text>Warping or kedging is a method of moving a sailing vessel, typically against the wind or current, after running aground, or out from a dead calm, by hauling on a line attached to a kedge anchor, a sea anchor, or a fixed object, such as a bollard or tree. In small boats, the anchor may be thrown in the intended direction of progress and hauled in after it settles, thus pulling the boat in that direction, while larger ships can use a small boat to carry the anchor ahead, drop it, and then haul. For example, the sloop &quot;Adventure&quot; under the command of the infamous pirate Blackbeard ran aground attempting to kedge the &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Revenge&quot; off the bar near Beaufort Inlet, North Carolina, in June 1718.

<text>The New York City Opera (NYCO) is an American opera company located in Manhattan in New York City. The company has been active from 1943 through its 2013 bankruptcy, and again since 2016 when it was revived.

The opera company, dubbed &quot;the people&#x27;s opera&quot; by New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, was founded in 1943. The company&#x27;s stated purpose was to make opera accessible to a wide audience at a reasonable ticket price. It also sought to produce an innovative choice of repertory, and provide a home for American singers and composers. The company was originally housed at the New York City Center theater on West 55th Street in Manhattan. It later became part of the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts at the New York State Theater from 1966 to 2010. During this time it produced autumn and spring seasons of opera in repertory, and maintained extensive education and outreach programs, offering arts-in-education programs to 4,000 students in over 30 schools. In 2011, the company left Lincoln Center due to financial pressures and moved its offices to 75 Broad Street in Lower Manhattan. In the 2011−12 and 2012−13 seasons, NYCO performed four operas at different venues in New York City, including the Brooklyn Academy of Music. On October 1, 2013, following an unsuccessful emergency fund-raising campaign, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

In January 2016, a nonprofit group, NYCO Renaissance, revived the opera company under new management when its reorganization plans for the company to leave bankruptcy and re-launch performances were approved in bankruptcy court. The group, led by Roy Niederhoffer, a hedge fund manager and former board member of the NYCO, announced plans to present a season of opera in 2016−17. The first opera was Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot;, presented at the Rose Theater at Jazz at Lincoln Center in January 2016.

During its 70-year-plus history, the NYCO has helped launch the careers of many great opera singers including Beverly Sills, Sherrill Milnes, Plácido Domingo, Maralin Niska, Carol Vaness, José Carreras, Shirley Verrett, Tatiana Troyanos, Jerry Hadley, Catherine Malfitano, Samuel Ramey, and Gianna Rolandi. Sills later served as the company&#x27;s director from 1979 until 1989. More recent acclaimed American singers who have called NYCO home include David Daniels, Mark Delavan, Mary Dunleavy, Lauren Flanigan, Elizabeth Futral, Bejun Mehta, Robert Brubaker and Carl Tanner. NYCO has similarly championed the work of American composers; approximately one-third of its repertoire has traditionally been American opera. The company&#x27;s American repertoire has ranged from established works (&quot;e.g.&quot;, Douglas Moore&#x27;s &quot;The Ballad of Baby Doe&quot;, Carlisle Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Susannah&quot;, and Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot;) to new works (&quot;e.g.&quot;, Thomas Pasatieri&#x27;s &quot;Before Breakfast&quot; and Mark Adamo&#x27;s &quot;Little Women&quot;). NYCO&#x27;s commitment to the future of American opera was demonstrated in its annual series, &quot;Vox, Contemporary Opera Lab&quot;, in which operas-in-progress were showcased, giving composers a chance to hear their work performed by professional singers and orchestra. The company has also occasionally produced musicals and operettas, including works by Stephen Sondheim and Gilbert and Sullivan.

==Early years: 1943–51==
The NYCO was founded as the New York City Center Opera, and originally made its home at the New York City Center on West 55th Street, in Manhattan. City Center&#x27;s chair of the finance committee, Morton Baum, mayor Fiorello La Guardia and council president Newbold Morris hired Laszlo Halasz hired the company&#x27;s first director, serving in that position from 1943 until 1951. Given the company&#x27;s goal of making opera accessible to the masses, Halasz believed that tickets should be inexpensive and that productions should be staged convincingly with singers who were both physically and vocally suited to their roles. To this end, ticket prices during the company&#x27;s first season were priced at just 75 cents to $2 ($ in current dollar terms), and the company operated on a budget of $30,463 ($ in current dollar terms) during its first season. At such prices the company was unable to afford the star billing enjoyed by the Metropolitan Opera. Halasz, however, was able to turn this fact into a virtue by making the company an important platform for young singers, particularly American opera singers.

The company&#x27;s first season opened on February 21, 1944, with Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot;, and included productions of Friedrich von Flotow&#x27;s &quot;Martha&quot; and Georges Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;, all of them conducted by Halasz. Several notable singers performed with the company in the first season, including Dusolina Giannini, Jennie Tourel and Martha Lipton, who was immediately poached by the Met after their NYCO debuts. Other notable singers Halasz brought to the NYCO included Frances Bible, Adelaide Bishop, Débria Brown, Mack Harrell, Thomas Hayward, Dorothy Kirsten, Brenda Lewis, Eva Likova, Leon Lishner, Regina Resnik, Norman Scott, Ramón Vinay, and Frances Yeend. In 1945, the company became the first major opera company to have an African American performer. This was in the production of Leoncavallo&#x27;s &quot;Pagliacci&quot;, with Todd Duncan&#x27;s performance as Tonio. Lawrence Winters and Robert McFerrin were other notable African American opera pioneers to sing with the company during this period. The first African American woman to sing with the company was soprano Camilla Williams, as the title heroine in &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; in 1946.

Halasz had a tumultuous relationship with the company&#x27;s board of directors, given his strong opinions about what the NYCO should be. For one, he supported the idea of performing foreign language works in English to make opera more accessible to American audiences. He insisted on offering at least one production in English every season. The issue that created, the most tension between Halasz and the board was Halasz&#x27;s commitment to staging new works by American composers and rarely heard operas at the opera house. The first New York City premiere presented by the company was Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; on October 10, 1946, with Ella Flesch in the title role, Virginia MacWatters as Zerbinetta, and James Pease as the music master. The production was described by the contemporary press as &quot;record breaking&quot;, and it put the company &quot;on the map&quot;. The NYCO subsequently toured &quot;Ariadne&quot; to His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, Montreal, giving the opera&#x27;s Canadian premiere.

The first world premiere at the house was William Grant Still&#x27;s &quot;Troubled Island&quot; in 1949. It was notably the first grand opera composed by an African-American to be produced in a major opera house. In the fall of 1949, the NYCO revived Prokofiev&#x27;s comic opera &quot;The Love for Three Oranges&quot;, which had not been seen in America since its unsuccessful Chicago premiere in 1921. The new production, directed by Vladimir Rosing, turned into a smash hit and was brought back for two additional seasons.

Also in 1949, Halasz scheduled the world premiere of David Tamkin&#x27;s &quot;The Dybbuk&quot; to be performed by the NYCO in 1950. However, the NYCO board opposed the decision and ultimately the production was postponed for financial reasons. Halasz, however, rescheduled the work for inclusion in the 1951/52 season. Uneasy with Halasz&#x27;s bold repertoire choices, the NYCO board insisted in 1951 that Halasz submit his repertory plans for their approval. As a result, he resigned, along with several members of his conducting staff, including Jean Morel, and two of his eventual successors, Joseph Rosenstock and Julius Rudel. Faced with the resignations of most of their creative staff, the board reluctantly backed down and &quot;The Dybbuk&quot; was given its world premiere at the NYCO on October 4, 1951. But tensions remained high between Halasz and the board, and they fired him in late 1951 when Halasz became involved in union disputes.

==Rosenstock and Leinsdorf: 1952–57==
After Halász was fired, the NYCO board appointed Joseph Rosenstock, who was already working as a conductor with the company, as the new director. He served in that post for four seasons, during which time he continued in Halász&#x27;s steps of scheduling innovative programs with unusual repertoire mixed in with standard works. He notably staged the world premiere of Aaron Copland&#x27;s &quot;The Tender Land&quot;, the New York premiere of William Walton&#x27;s &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;, and the United States premieres of Gottfried von Einem&#x27;s &quot;The Trial&quot; and Béla Bartók&#x27;s &quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle&quot;. Rosenstock was also the first NYCO director to include musical theatre in the company&#x27;s repertoire, with a 1954 production of Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II&#x27;s &quot;Show Boat&quot;; a production which starred Broadway musical veteran and operatic soprano Helena Bliss. This decision was ridiculed by the press, but Rosenstock felt justified as the musical played to a packed house. Meanwhile, the company&#x27;s staging of Donizetti&#x27;s opera &quot;Don Pasquale&quot; that season only sold 35 percent of the house seats.

In January 1956 the NYCO board accepted Rosenstock&#x27;s resignation. He stated that he left because he was faced with too much non-musical work such as bookings and business negotiations. The board appointed Erich Leinsdorf, who had worked as a conductor at the Metropolitan Opera, the Cleveland Orchestra, and the Rochester Philharmonic, to take his place. Leinsdorf stayed with the company for only one season. He was fired after his ambitious program of contemporary and unusual works for the 1956 season failed to soothe financial problems at the NYCO, and drew harsh criticism from the press. The press particularly did not care for his new productions of Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot; and the American premiere of Carl Orff&#x27;s &quot;Der Mond&quot;. However, Leinsdorf did have one major triumph with the first professional production of Carlisle Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Susannah&quot; with Phyllis Curtin in the title role, and Norman Treigle as the Reverend Blitch. The production was a critical success with both audiences and critics, and the opera went on to become an American classic.

==Rudel: 1957–79==

After Leinsdorf was fired, the NYCO board canceled its 1957 spring season and eventually appointed Julius Rudel as the new general director of the company. Rudel had been hired by the NYCO straight out of college in 1944, and had worked on the conducting staff there for 13 years. Under Rudel&#x27;s leadership, the company reached new artistic heights, drawing critical praise for its performances of both standard and adventurous works. The company became known for its cutting-edge stage direction, largely due to Rudel&#x27;s willingness to poach renowned directors from the theatre who had not necessarily been involved with opera before. By the mid-1960s the company was generally regarded as one of the leading opera companies in the United States.

During his tenure at City Opera, Rudel displayed a strong commitment to American opera, commissioning 12 works and leading 19 world premieres. He also led a large number of United States premieres, including Alberto Ginastera&#x27;s &quot;Don Rodrigo&quot; with tenor Plácido Domingo for the inauguration of the NYCO&#x27;s new home at the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center (now called the David H. Koch Theater) on February 22, 1966. That same season the company presented the New York premiere of Poulenc&#x27;s &quot;Dialogues of the Carmelites&quot;.

Like his predecessors, Rudel had an eye for young American talent and was responsible for helping to cultivate a couple of generations of American singers. Among the singers whose careers he furthered were bass-baritone Samuel Ramey and lirico-spinto soprano Carol Vaness. One of his most apt decisions was in forming an artistic partnership with Beverly Sills, making her the NYCO&#x27;s leading soprano from 1956 until her retirement from the stage in 1979, although Joseph Rosenstock deserves the credit for hiring her in 1955 for her first performances with the company. With the NYCO Sills had her first major critical success in the first Handel opera staged by the company, the role of Cleopatra in &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; opposite Norman Treigle in 1966. At that time Handel operas were rarely produced and the production drew a lot of attention from the international press. Sills was soon making appearances with all the major opera houses around the world. While Sills was busy with her international career, she remained a regular performer with the NYCO until her retirement. In 1970 John Simon White was appointed managing director of the NYCO, in order to free up Rudel&#x27;s schedule for the more artistic side of his job. White remained in that position until 1980.

==Sills: 1979–88==

Upon Sills&#x27;s retirement from the stage in 1979, she succeeded Rudel as General Director of the NYCO. Initially the plan was for Sills to share the post with Rudel, and slowly phase him out. However, Rudel decided to resign in 1979 in order to take a position as music director of the Buffalo Philharmonic, and Sills took the post over entirely.

At the time Sills assumed her position, the NYCO was in financial difficulties, burdened with a three million dollar debt after a few seasons with less than favorable reviews. On the business side, Sills proved to be a godsend to the company, showing a prodigious gift for fund-raising. By the time she retired from her post in early 1989, she had grown the company&#x27;s budget from $9 million ($ in current dollar terms) to $26 million ($ in current dollar terms), and left the company in the black with a $3 million ($ in current dollar terms) surplus. She was able to achieve this while still reducing ticket prices by 20 percent, with the hope of attracting new and younger audiences.

==Keene: 1989–95==
Sills retired as General Director in 1989, and was replaced by conductor Christopher Keene—largely on the basis of Sills&#x27; strong recommendation. Keene had previously worked as a conductor at the NYCO since 1970, and had served as the NYCO&#x27;s Music Director from 1982 to 1986. Keene consistently presented innovative opera seasons that were successful with critics during his tenure. His last season with the company included the United States premieres of Toshiro Mayuzumi&#x27;s &quot;Kinkakuji&quot; [The Golden Pavilion] and Jost Meier&#x27;s &quot;Dreyfus Affair&quot;. A month before his death Peter G. Davis wrote in &quot;New York&quot; that &quot;Keene is one of the few authentic cultural heroes New York has left, thanks to his many recent acts of courage, personal as well as artistic.&quot;

Keene held the position until his death from lymphoma arising from AIDS at the age of 48. His last performance, at the City Opera, was of Hindemith&#x27;s &quot;Mathis der Maler&quot; in September 1995.

==Kellogg: 1996–2007==
Keene was succeeded in 1996 by Glimmerglass Opera&#x27;s general and artistic director, Paul Kellogg. Under his leadership, the NYCO added 62 new productions to its repertoire, including several world premieres by American composers, and inaugurated the series: &quot;Vox: Showcasing American Composers&quot;. Kellogg was also instrumental in establishing the NYCO as an important producer of operas by baroque masters such as Handel, Gluck, and Rameau, sparking a renewal of interest in these long-neglected works. A particular triumph was a highly lauded production of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Orlando&quot; in 2007 in a modern production by Chas Rader-Shieber that starred countertenor Bejun Mehta and the soprano Amy Burton. In keeping with NYCO&#x27;s &quot;people&#x27;s opera&quot; tradition, Kellogg inaugurated NYCO&#x27;s &quot;Opera for All&quot; event, with reduced priced tickets, in 2005.

Kellogg announced his retirement in 2007. Anthony Tommasini, in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, commented that Kellogg had &quot;a record of innovation and achievement to be proud of. Few leaders of performing-arts institutions have been as effective at defining and carrying out a company mission&quot;. Tommasini called Kellogg&#x27;s decision, at the urging of New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, to open its season on September 15, 2001, directly after the 9/11 attacks, &quot;the most meaningful day of music in 2001,&quot; and later used NYCO&#x27;s opening day in 2001 and its 2009/10 season as symbolic bookends for New York&#x27;s music scene in the first decade of the 21st century.

===Vox, Contemporary Opera Lab===
Vox, Contemporary Opera Lab (also known as &quot;Vox: Showcasing American Composers&quot;) was an annual concert series dedicated to the development of contemporary American operas. Founded by New York City Opera in 1999, the festival offered composers and librettists the opportunity to hear excerpts of their works performed with professional singers and musicians. Up to twelve excerpts of previously un-produced operas were performed at each festival. Many of the operas that were presented at Vox went on to be presented in full production by New York City Opera and various other opera companies, including Richard Danielpour&#x27;s &quot;Margaret Garner&quot;. From 2006, the Vox performances were presented at New York University&#x27;s Skirball Center for the Performing Arts.

==Interregnum: 2008–09==
A note of uncertainty about the company&#x27;s future emerged in November 2008, when Gerard Mortier, who was scheduled to begin his first official season as General and Artistic Director of the company in 2009, abruptly resigned. The company announced that &quot;The economic climate in which we find ourselves today has caused us both to reconsider proceeding with our plans.&quot; Mortier had reportedly been promised a $60 million annual budget, which was cut to $36 million due to the economic climate. Michael Kaiser was appointed to advise the board on a turnaround strategy, including the recruitment of a new general director.

The David H. Koch Theater (previously known as the New York State Theater) underwent major renovations during the 2008/09 season. During the construction the company did not stage opera in its home at Lincoln Center. Instead, New York City Opera presented a concert version of Samuel Barber&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; at Carnegie Hall in January 2009, as well as other concerts and programs around the city, and continued to make classroom presentations in New York City&#x27;s public schools. The company presented three concerts at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in 2009: &quot;I&#x27;m On My Way: Black History at City Opera&quot;, &quot;One Fine Day: A Tribute to Camilla Williams&quot;, and a 60th anniversary concert production of William Grant Still&#x27;s &quot;Troubled Island&quot;.

In June 2009 Bloomberg reported that the company had incurred a $11 million deficit for the year ending June 2008. Revenue fell 23 percent to $32.9 million, and expenses rose 11 percent to $44.2 million.

==Steel: 2009–13==
In January 2009, the company announced the appointment of George Steel as general manager and artistic director, effective February 1, 2009. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported at the time that &quot;many consider [the NYCO] the nation&#x27;s second most important house.&quot;

In January 2009, when Steel was asked to take the helm of the opera to try to turn the company around, it had suffered a string of financial and managerial blows: a decade of multimillion-dollar deficits, a &quot;dark&quot; season in 2008/09 (&quot;i.e.&quot;, a season without any staged opera performances), the depletion of Company&#x27;s endowment to pay off a huge accumulated deficit, the market collapse of 2008, the radical reduction by the board of the budget and of the size of the season, and the sudden withdrawal of Gerard Mortier, who was to have become General Manager after a lengthy period without leadership (Paul Kellogg, the previous General Director had left in 2007).

Under Steel during the 2009–2010 season, the company returned with an opening night program called &quot;American Voices&quot; consisting of excerpts from American opera. The season also included a revival of Hugo Weisgall&#x27;s &quot;Esther&quot;, and a new production of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; directed by Christopher Alden. The spring season opened in March 2010 and included Emmanuel Chabrier&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;étoile&quot; directed by Mark Lamos, and Handel&#x27;s &quot;Partenope&quot; directed by Andrew Chown; original production directed by Francisco Negrin. The company also continued to collaborate with the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture and Opera Noire of New York to highlight the role of opera in African-American history, including the programs &quot;Opera at the Schomburg&quot;, &quot;A Tribute to Robert McFerrin&quot;, and &quot;X, The Life and Times of Malcolm X&quot;. In April 2010, NYCO&#x27;s &quot;VOX Contemporary Opera Lab&quot; featured new works of emerging and established composers at New York University.

The company&#x27;s 2010–2011 season included a new production of Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;A Quiet Place&quot; directed by Christopher Alden; Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Intermezzo&quot; directed by Leon Major; and a new production titled &quot;Monodramas&quot; which consisted of three solo one-act works: John Zorn&#x27;s &quot;La Machine de l&#x27;être&quot;, Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Erwartung&quot;, and Morton Feldman&#x27;s &quot;Neither&quot;. The company also staged the American premiere of &quot;Séance on a Wet Afternoon&quot;, the first opera by Stephen Schwartz, the veteran composer of Broadway musicals.

In addition, the company presented several concert performances that included: &quot;An Evening With Christine Brewer&quot;; &quot;Lucky To Be Me: The Music of Leonard Bernstein&quot;; &quot;John Zorn &amp; Friends&quot; (with Laurie Anderson, Lou Reed, Mike Patton, Marc Ribot, Dave Douglas, and Uri Caine); a family opera concert of Oliver Knussen&#x27;s &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; with a libretto by Maurice Sendak; and &quot;Defying Gravity: The Music of Stephen Schwartz&quot; with Kristin Chenoweth and Raúl Esparza. In May 2011, the company announced that it would leave Lincoln Center to conserve costs, and present its upcoming season in different venues throughout the city.

On the business side, the opera underwent tremendous change under Steel&#x27;s tenure, which both balanced the budget and extended the life of the company. These changes led directly to the opera&#x27;s first balanced budgets in an over a decade and a sold-out 2011–2012 season. Some of the steps Steel took in his efforts to save the company aroused controversy, including a contentious, but ultimately successful, contract negotiation with the labor unions representing the orchestra and the singers, and the departure of the opera from Lincoln Center out of financial necessity. While the company had for more than a decade discussed publicly the idea of leaving Lincoln Center, the company&#x27;s ultimate departure, driven by the financial reality that the opera would otherwise have to close, was met alternately with praise and scepticism. Notwithstanding artistic successes, record fundraising, and dramatic changes to the company&#x27;s business model, the opera ultimately succumbed to bankruptcy.

==Bankruptcy: 2013–15==
On October 1, 2013, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, citing an inability to raise sufficient funding to continue the 2013/14 season. The company&#x27;s last production was the U.S. premiere of Mark-Anthony Turnage&#x27;s &quot;Anna Nicole&quot;. The case was before Judge Sean Lane.

In an article in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, music critic Anthony Tommasini noted one of the reasons for the company&#x27;s 2013 bankruptcy (as well as relating it to other failed arts organizations):
In short, artistic excellence is not enough. Any institution, big or small, old or new, must have a clear artistic vision, a purpose that connects with audiences and the community. But the performing arts have never been profit-making endeavors. It is more important than ever that all institutions, from a fledgling string quartet to the lofty Metropolitan Opera, have an effective business model.

==Revival: since 2016==
A not-for-profit company named NYCO Renaissance Ltd. proposed a Chapter 11 plan for the reorganization of New York City Opera in 2015, and the reorganization of the existing company took place in 2016. An additional incentive was made to those who had purchased tickets and not received a refund.

The group announced plans to relaunch New York City Opera in January 2016, with a mix of opera staples and niche works. The proposed new home for a revived NYCO is the modern 1,100-seat Rose Theater at Jazz at Lincoln Center. Both the City Opera board and – unanimously – the creditors&#x27; committee (those owed money in the bankruptcy) preferred the bid of NYCO Renaissance, which was backed financially and chaired by Roy Niederhoffer, a hedge fund manager and accomplished amateur musician who had earlier served on the New York City Opera board, and who pledged more than $1 million of his own money to the effort, and raised at least $2.5 million.

The bankruptcy court approved the reorganization plan of New York City Opera Renaissance, allowing it to leave bankruptcy and re-launch performances, in January 2016. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane said he was pleased to approve the plan of &quot;a beloved and important cultural institution,&quot; and that &quot;It&#x27;s been the participation of people who care greatly about the opera that&#x27;s led to what I think is a very good result here today.&quot; Under the reorganization plan, the opera will put on annual seasons, and its general director will be Michael Capasso. Gail Kruvand, the chairwoman of the City Opera orchestra committee, said: &quot;We&#x27;re thrilled ... and we&#x27;re looking forward to a long future with New York City Opera.&quot;

NYCO Renaissance presented Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot; – using Adolfo Hohenstein&#x27;s stage and costume design from the opera&#x27;s premiere in 1900 in Rome – in January 2016 at the 1,100-seat Rose Theater. It had two separate casts, including tenor James Valenti and soprano Latonia Moore, and the least expensive balcony seats were $25. &quot;Tosca&quot; had been, in 1944, the first opera performed by the NYCO.

The NYCO announced that it would round out the 2015–16 season with the performance of three contemporary works, all new to the company. On March 16, 2016, a new concert series at the Appel Room in Jazz at Lincoln Center was inaugurated with the premiere of David Hertzberg&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;. A work for soprano and small ensemble, it featured soprano Sarah Shafer and mezzo-soprano Kirstin Chávez. That was followed by the East Coast premiere of composer Stewart Wallace&#x27;s and librettist Michael Korie&#x27;s &quot;Hopper&#x27;s Wife&quot; – a surreal, erotically-charged 90-minute 1997 chamber opera fantasy about an imagined marriage between the painter Edward Hopper and the gossip columnist Hedda Hopper. It was directed by Andreas Mitisek at Harlem Stage from April 28 through May 1, 2016, in his New York City directorial debut. Third, the NYCO staged Daniel Catán&#x27;s &quot;Florencia en el Amazonas&quot; June 22–26, 2016 at Jazz at Lincoln Center&#x27;s Rose Theater. Based on the writing of Gabriel García Márquez, the opera was part of a new Spanish-language opera series named Ópera en Español. Reviewing the performance, James Jorden of &quot;The New York Observer&quot; wrote: &quot;[in] the current offering of the resurrected New York City Opera ... every page of the score sails orgasmically over the top, as sinfully rich as molten caramel sauce ... The reconstituted New York City Opera should be bursting with pride at the high level of quality extending across every aspect of this presentation ... Among as strong a cast of vocalists as I&#x27;ve heard at NYCO in 20 years or more, the standout appropriately was Elizabeth Caballero as Florencia. ... this production makes it clear that the company is at the very top of its game.&quot; &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; opined that &quot;Ms. Caballero is a find.&quot; &quot;New York Classical Review&quot;, while noting some staging flaws, wrote: &quot;If this is to be the standard of the company&#x27;s work going forward, the future may be very bright indeed.&quot;

The NYCO&#x27;s Opening Night for the 2016–17 season, on September 8, 2016, was a new production double bill of two operas that both premiered in May 1892, &quot;Aleko&quot; (a New York premier; composed by Sergei Rachmaninoff, an adaptation of Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s poem &quot;The Gypsies&quot;) and &quot;Pagliacci&quot; (by Ruggero Leoncavallo). They were directed by Lev Pugliese, with conductor James Meena leading the NYCO Orchestra, at Rose Theater at Jazz at Lincoln Center&#x27;s Rose Hall. Bass Stefan Szkafarowsky made his NYCO debut in the title role of Aleko, and &quot;Pagliacci&quot; featured tenor Francesco Anile in his NYCO debut as Canio. Anthony Tommasini of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;the performance offered animated, if sometimes scrappy, playing by the New York City Opera Orchestra ... and vibrant singing from the company&#x27;s chorus. ... &quot;Pagliacci&quot; offers strong, if not exceptional, vocal performances in the leading roles. The tenor Francesco Anile brings a sizable, somewhat nasal voice to Canio, the betrayed husband. As Nedda, his straying wife, the soprano Jessica Rose Cambio sings with agile coloratura and mostly shimmering sound. ... An enthusiastic audience showed up for the opening event in what should be a revealing, even defining, season for the rebooted City Opera.&quot; &quot;New York Classical Review&quot; wrote: &quot;On this occasion, Pagliacci emerged considerably more moving than the recent Met production by David McVicar, mostly due to the Rose&#x27;s increased intimacy. It also didn&#x27;t hurt that, for the role of Canio, the company snagged Francesco Anile ... [who] has the voice: a clear, expressive instrument that pleasantly &quot;pings&quot; above the orchestra, and equally, what appears to be a fountain of acting chops. In the famous scene in which Canio realizes that Nedda has been unfaithful, the soft sobbing into his costume was undeniably affecting. And when he leaped onstage to open the traveling show, his drunkenness was believable, not overdone. ... After a rocky few years, this musically and emotionally satisfying double bill is the best evidence yet that this storied company may at last be staggering to its feet.&quot; &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; opined: &quot;NYCO is on the right track to re-establishing itself as a force in the opera world.&quot;

In January 2022, NYCO produced the world premiere of Michael Korie and Ricky Ian Gordon&#x27;s &quot;The Garden of the Finzi-Continis&quot; in co-production with the National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene.

<text>In physics, an infrared fixed point is a set of coupling constants, or other parameters, that evolve from arbitrary initial values at very high energies (short distance) to fixed, stable values, usually predictable, at low energies (large distance). This usually involves the use of the renormalization group, which specifically details the way parameters in a physical system (a quantum field theory) depend on the energy scale being probed.

Conversely, if the length-scale decreases and the physical parameters approach fixed values, then we have ultraviolet fixed points. The fixed points are generally independent of the initial values of the parameters over a large range of the initial values. This is known as universality.

==Statistical physics==
In the statistical physics of second order phase transitions, the physical system approaches an infrared fixed point that is independent of the
initial short distance dynamics that defines the material. This determines the properties of the phase transition at the critical temperature, or critical point. Observables, such as critical exponents usually depend only upon dimension of space, and are independent of the atomic or molecular constituents.

==Top Quark==

In the Standard Model, quarks and leptons have &quot;Yukawa couplings&quot; to the Higgs boson which determine the masses of the particles. Most of the quarks&#x27; and leptons&#x27; Yukawa couplings are small compared to the top quark&#x27;s Yukawa coupling. Yukawa couplings are not constants and their properties change depending on the energy scale at which they are measured, this is known as &quot;running&quot; of the constants. The dynamics of Yukawa couplings are determined by the renormalization group equation:

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the color gauge coupling (which is a function of formula_3 and associated with asymptotic freedom ) and formula_4 is the Yukawa coupling for the quark formula_5 This equation describes how the Yukawa coupling changes with energy scale formula_6

A more complete version of the same formula is more appropriate for the top quark:
: formula_7

where is the weak isospin gauge coupling and is the weak hypercharge gauge coupling. For small or near constant values of and the qualitative behavior is the same.

The Yukawa couplings of the up, down, charm, strange and bottom quarks, are small at the extremely high energy scale of grand unification, formula_8 Therefore, the formula_9 term can be neglected in the above equation for all but the top quark. Solving, we then find that formula_4 is increased slightly at the low energy scales at which the quark masses are generated by the Higgs, formula_11

On the other hand, solutions to this equation for large initial values typical for the top quark formula_12 cause the expression on the right side to quickly approach zero as we descend in energy scale, which stopsformula_12 from changing and locks it to the QCD coupling formula_14 This is known as a (infrared) quasi-fixed point of the renormalization group equation for the Yukawa coupling. No matter what the initial starting value of the coupling is, if it is sufficiently large at high energies to begin with, it will reach this quasi-fixed point value, and the corresponding quark mass is predicted to be about formula_15

The renormalization group equation for 
large values of the top Yukawa coupling was first
considered in 1981 by Pendleton &amp; Ross,
and the &quot;infrared quasi-fixed point&quot; was proposed by Hill.
The prevailing view at the time was that the top quark mass would lie in a range of 15 to 26 GeV. The quasi-infrared fixed point emerged in top quark condensation theories of electroweak symmetry breaking in which the Higgs boson is composite at extremely short distance scales, composed of a pair of top and anti-top quarks.

While the value of the quasi-fixed point is determined in the Standard Model of about formula_16 if there is more than one Higgs doublet, the value will be reduced by an increase in the factor in the equation, and any Higgs mixing angle effects. Since the observed top quark mass of 174 GeV is slightly lower than the standard model prediction by about 20%, this suggests there may be
more Higgs doublets beyond the single standard model Higgs boson. If there are many additional Higgs doublets in nature the predicted value of the quasi-fixed point comes into agreement with experiment. Even if there are two Higgs doublets, the fixed point for the top mass is reduced, 170~200 GeV. Some theorists believed this was supporting evidence for the Supersymmetric Standard Model, however no other signs of supersymmetry have emerged at the Large Hadron Collider.

==Banks–Zaks fixed point==

Another example of an infrared fixed point is the Banks–Zaks fixed point in which the coupling constant of a Yang–Mills theory evolves to a fixed value. The beta-function vanishes, and the theory possesses a symmetry known as conformal symmetry.

<doc id="671885" wikidata="Q334088" url="?curid=671885" title="Christopher Addison, 1st Viscount Addison">
<text>Christopher Addison, 1st Viscount Addison (19 June 1869 – 11 December 1951), was a British medical doctor and politician. A member of the Liberal and Labour parties, he served as Minister of Munitions during the First World War and was later Minister of Health under David Lloyd George and Leader of the House of Lords under Clement Attlee.

He was a prominent anatomist and perhaps the most eminent doctor ever to enter the Commons. He was a leader in issues of health, wartime munitions, housing and agriculture. Although not highly visible, he played a major role in the post war governments after both world wars. Addison worked hard to promote the National Insurance scheme in 1911. Lloyd George made him the first Minister of Health when the ministry was created in 1919, and Addison oversaw an expansion of council housing after the Great War with an increase in public funding to local authority housing schemes with the Housing, Town Planning, &amp;c. Act 1919. He later joined the Labour Party.

==Background and education==
Addison was born in the rural parish of Hogsthorpe in Lincolnshire, the son of Robert Addison and Susan, daughter of Charles Fanthorpe. His family had owned and run a farm for several generations and he maintained a strong interest in agriculture and rural matters throughout his life. He attended Trinity College, Harrogate, from the age of thirteen. He trained in medicine at Sheffield School of Medicine and St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital in London. His education was expensive for his family, and he insisted on re-paying his parents once he had begun his career.

In 1892, Addison graduated from the University of London as a Bachelor of Medicine and Science with honours in forensic medicine. A year later he qualified as a Medical Doctor and two years after that he was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons. He combined private practice with academic research, and taught anatomy at Sheffield School of Medicine. In 1896 he became professor of anatomy at the newly formed University College of Sheffield, and edited the &quot;Quarterly Medical Journal&quot; from 1898 to 1901. In 1901, he moved to London again, teaching at Charing Cross Hospital. He published his research on anatomy and became Hunterian professor with the Royal College of Surgeons.

Addison&#x27;s principal contributions to anatomy were in his writings in three volumes of the &quot;Journal of Anatomy&quot;, 1899–1901, &quot;On the topographical anatomy of the abdominal viscera in man&quot;. Subsequently, he contributed to the three-dimensional mapping of the abdomen, which was based on numerous bodily measurements, &quot;some 10,000 measurements made on forty bodies&quot;. He linked his measurements to an imaginary plane of section, known as &quot;Addison&#x27;s transpyloric plane&quot;.

==Political career==

===1907–1914===
Motivated by concern for the treatment of the poor, and that the effects of poverty on health could be fought only by governments, not by doctors, Addison entered politics. He was adopted as Liberal candidate for Hoxton, Shoreditch, in 1907, and was duly elected in the January 1910 general election.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George, noted Addison&#x27;s medical background and asked him to speak in support of the 1911 National Insurance Bill, both in Parliament and with the British Medical Association. In August 1914, he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education, under Jack Pease. His work here was largely concerned with improving the health and welfare of children, but was cut short following the outbreak of the First World War.

===World War===
Addison became Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Munitions in May 1915.

Addison introduced a degree of intervention in the free market known as &quot;War Socialism&quot; to prompt faster munitions production. Private enterprise in key sectors was brought under the control of government, which erected its own factories, and great care was taken to improve the welfare of the munitions workers, both male and female. Ammunition supply-lines dictated the tempo of the war, especially in the first year of fighting, so stability and productivity within this industry were of the utmost importance. The government subsidised housing estates, such as Vickerstown on Walney Island (now in Cumbria), with integral religious, social and recreational amenities, to enable pools of munitions workers and their families to move next to expanded armament factories. Raymond Unwin, an influential civil servant from this time injected some of the late Victorian/utopian/Fabian philosophy of garden suburbs and ideals from the cheap cottages movement launched in 1905.

With hindsight, this may be seen as something of a prototype of the municipal housing that followed in the post-war period and the beginnings of town planning as an accepted concern of the state. Fellow idealists might well have regretted the design, layout and landscaping compromises inevitably struck in the pursuit of rapid construction to support homeland defence as an over-riding priority. Improved dimensions of kitchens, bathrooms and gardens for working-class houses might also be seen as a response to a more equal valuation of women as competent industrial workers and a political force.

The Ministry of Munitions was a new Ministry, created and headed by David Lloyd George to rapidly improve and increase production of munitions. Working conditions were improved in the new, state-owned industry, and Addison created and implemented schemes that greatly increased the efficiency of production. He became a Privy Counsellor and was promoted to Minister of Munitions when Lloyd George became Minister of War in July 1916. He supported Lloyd George against the Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith, at the end of 1916, and continued into the new coalition cabinet.

===Postwar planning===
In July 1917, he became a Minister Without Portfolio with responsibility for analysing the problems that Britain would face after the war and preparing plans for reconstruction. He worked with Arthur Greenwood to develop programmes for sweeping social reforms. Perhaps Addison&#x27;s greatest achievement was the establishment of a costing system which by the end of the war had saved an estimated £440 million.

Addison&#x27;s Hoxton constituency was abolished for the 1918 general election, when he was elected for the new Shoreditch constituency.

Although Lloyd George was increasingly influenced by the Conservative members of his coalition government, Addison&#x27;s plans formed the basis of much post-war legislation. Addison became President of the Local Government Board in January 1919, with the goal of transforming it into a Ministry of Health. He became the first Minister of Health in June following the passing of the Ministry of Health Act 1919. He was responsible for a great deal of public health improvements and social legislation. He ensured the extension of health and hospital services: increasing the treatment provision for communicable diseases such as venereal diseases and tuberculosis; increasing provision for maternal health and infant welfare as well as home nursing. He successfully introduced the Nurse Registration Act 1919, establishing for the first time a register of nurses under the auspices of the General Nursing Council. He introduced the first Housing and Town Planning Act, under which the state built low-rent homes (council houses) for the working-class. Addison also reviewed and increased the provisions of the National Insurance system, and introduced programmes to improve healthcare and training. However, he presided over large increases in public spending and this raised the ire of Conservatives in the government. He was moved from the Ministry of Health in April 1921, becoming Minister Without Portfolio. Addison resigned in July 1921 when a Cabinet committee decided to halt the housing construction scheme altogether; he subsequently became a strong critic of the government.

===1922–1937===
Addison lost his seat in the 1922 general election. Since the end of the war, he had found himself increasingly detached from both warring factions of the Liberal Party. His belief in social reform and progressive policies brought him close to the socialism of the Labour Party, and he campaigned for Labour candidates at the 1923 general election.

During this time he returned to his family farm and published a number of books, including &quot;The Betrayal of the Slums&quot;, on the link between poor housing and poor health, and &quot;Practical Socialism&quot;. He stood unsuccessfully as Labour&#x27;s candidate in the constituency of Hammersmith South for the 1924 general election, before winning the Swindon constituency in Wiltshire, at the 1929 general election. Ramsay MacDonald appointed Addison as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture in 1929. He served under Noel Buxton, and succeeded him as Minister of Agriculture in June 1930. He worked with Clement Attlee, the future Leader of the Labour party with whom he formed a close relationship, and was an active member of the Socialist Medical Association.

Facing economic crisis in 1931, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Snowden, proposed swingeing cuts to public spending, particularly to unemployment benefit. Addison voted against these cuts in cabinet and went into Opposition when MacDonald formed a National Government with the Conservatives and Liberals. Addison lost his seat at the 1931 general election. In 1934 he regained his Swindon seat in a by-election, but lost it a second time at the 1935 general election. During the Spanish Civil War he helped organise medical aid to Spain, as president of the Spanish Medical Aid Committee. 

===1937–1951===
In May 1937, Addison joined the Labour party&#x27;s meagre caucus in the House of Lords, being raised to the peerage as Baron Addison, of Stallingborough in the County of Lincoln. He was Chairman of the Buckinghamshire War Agricultural Committee during the Second World War, co-ordinating agricultural production and supply in that county. Attlee appointed Addison to be Labour&#x27;s leader in the Lords in 1940, after Lord Snell stepped down for health reasons. Addison retained this position until his death, serving as Leader of the House of Lords following Labour&#x27;s victory in the 1945 general election. He was created Viscount Addison, of Stallingborough in the County of Lincoln, in July 1945.

As Leader of the House of Lords, Addison had the key responsibility of steering government legislation through the upper chamber. He formed a good relationship with the leader of the Conservative opposition in the Lords, the Marquess of Salisbury. Through general consultation, Addison developed new guidelines for peers, particularly with regard to declaration of interests. He was also Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs in Attlee&#x27;s first cabinet, directing the transformation of the Dominion Affairs Office into the Office of Commonwealth Relations and playing an instrumental role in Labour&#x27;s early anti-imperialist policies and the strengthening of the British Commonwealth. In 1946, he became the first Labour politician to be made a Knight of the Garter. As his health began to deteriorate he withdrew from foreign affairs in 1947, subsequently holding a number of sinecure positions in combination with his leadership of the Lords, until Labour lost office in October 1951. As a result of Addison&#x27;s success in steering legislation through the House of Lords, the Attlee ministry issued few major reforms to the institution beyond limiting its delaying power to one year during its time in power.

==Family==
Lord Addison married firstly Isobel Mackinnon Gray in 1902. Isobel, the daughter of a wealthy Scottish businessman and shipping agent Archibald Gray, supported her husband morally and financially when he embarked upon a career in politics, and was involved in charitable causes in Shoreditch and Swindon. They had two daughters and three sons:

*Hon. Elizabeth Kate (21 December 1902 – 8 July 1967), married in 1935 Edward Worsley Ashcroft, brother of actress Dame Peggy Ashcroft 
*Christopher Addison, 2nd Viscount Addison (1904–1976), succeeded his father in his titles 
*Hon. Isobel Gray (20 January 1907 – 5 April 1989), married in 1932 Nicholas Cheshire, son of Francis Augustus Cheshire
*Paul Fanthorpe (7 September 1909 – 11 April 1912), died in childhood
*Michael Addison, 3rd Viscount Addison (1914–1992), succeeded his brother 

After Isobel&#x27;s death in 1934, Addison married secondly Dorothy, daughter of Frederick Percy Low, in 1937. Lord Addison died in December 1951, aged 82, only two months after the end of his political career. He was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son, Christopher. Lady Addison died in September 1982.

==Selected publications==
Addison wrote an important paper, &quot;On the Topographical Anatomy of the Abdominal Viscera in Man, especially the Gastro-Intestinal Canal&quot;, that was published in four parts in the &quot;Journal of Anatomy and Physiology&quot; between 1899 and 1901:
* Part I. July 1899, Vol. 33 (Part 4), 565.5.
* Part II. July 1900, Vol. 34 (Part 4), 427–450.9.
* Part III. January 1901, Vol. 35 (Part 2), 166–204.11. 
* Part IV. April 1901, Vol. 35 (Part 3), 277–304.9.

== Commemoration ==
Addison cut the first sod for Bristol City Council&#x27;s new Sea Mills estate on 4 June 1919. An oak tree was planted by city&#x27;s lady mayoress as part of the same event, it survives and is known as the Addison Tree. Over 90 streets are named after Addison across Britain, all in areas of social housing.

<text>The Croydon Canal ran from Croydon, via Forest Hill, to the Grand Surrey Canal at New Cross in south London, England. It opened in 1809 and closed in 1836, the first canal to be abandoned by an act of Parliament.

Authorised in 1801, the canal was originally intended to extend northwards to Rotherhithe, but the simultaneous construction of the Grand Surrey Canal provided a convenient access route. It was long, and opened on 22 October 1809.

The Croydon Canal linked to the Croydon, Merstham and Godstone Railway (itself connected to the Surrey Iron Railway), enabling the canal to be used to transport stone and lime from workings at Merstham. The canal was never extended further south-west, as was initially intended, to reach Epsom.

The canal was originally planned with two inclined planes but 28 locks, arranged in two flights, were used instead. To keep the canal supplied with water, reservoirs were constructed at Sydenham and South Norwood; the latter still exists as South Norwood Lake in a public park.

==History==

=== Origins ===
A canal from Croydon to Rotherhithe was the idea of Ralph Dodd, who had been commissioned in 1799 to ascertain “… the most eligible part of the River Thames” for a canal from Croydon. Dodd’s canal was to be on a small scale, only deep and wide at the top for boats up to 20 tons (20.3 tonnes). It would start in today’s Tamworth Road, Croydon and head north to the west of London Road (A23) until Broad Green where it would swing northeast towards Selhurst, Woodside and the west of Beckenham. It would broadly follow the Ravensbourne valley to Lewisham and Deptford, finally turning west of north to join the Thames at Rotherhithe, a distance of about 12 miles. Instead of locks there would be horse-powered inclined planes where the boat would be lowered down the hillside in a tank of water or caisson, counterbalanced by another caisson being raised. Bridges would be minimised where possible by using paved fords, the whole costing no more than £25,000. After finishing his report in November 1799, Dodd had no further involvement with the Croydon and Rotherhithe Canal, but went on to promote a scheme for a Grand Surrey Canal from Rotherhithe.

=== Design and planning ===
Following Dodd’s report, a meeting of prospective investors was held at the Croydon Greyhound where it was agreed that a canal from Croydon to Rotherhithe would be of great utility to Croydon, towns close to the canal and considerable parts of Kent, Surrey and Sussex.

A detailed survey was made by Mr Warner, and John Rennie was hired as the consulting engineer. This canal took a more direct line to Rotherhithe along a ridge of higher ground, which could loosely be described as the west side of the Ravensbourne valley. It headed northeast from West Croydon to Selhurst, turned north to South Norwood, Sydenham, Forest Hill and New Cross to join the Thames at Rotherhithe. The canal would remain on the same level from Croydon to Brockley at and drop down the hillside by 17 locks or 2 inclined planes by slightly different paths to New Cross, where it would remain on the same level to a tidal lock at the Thames. Rennie agreed that a canal of small dimensions would be sufficient, but recommended a larger canal to act in part as a reservoir. It was to be deep, wide along the summit level from Croydon and wide on the lower Rotherhithe level. Rennie also favoured a canal with steam powered inclined planes over locks on cost grounds. A disadvantage of inclined planes was they could only lift smaller, lighter boats that limited the bulky goods that could be carried on the canal. Several 5-7 ton (5.1 - 7.1 tonnes) boats or barges could be pulled in gangs by a single horse, but there would be delays at the inclined planes where the boats were individually raised or lowered. At over £46,000 Rennie’s canal was nearly twice the cost of Dodd’s; a large proportion of this was for the cost of 47 bridges (£6,460) and steam engines to power the inclined planes (£6,000). The large number of bridges were necessary to allow land owners to access land bisected by the canal.

=== Royal assent ===

Rennie completed his report on the 8 October 1800, which was presented to the investors on 10 October 1800. They adopted Rennie’s recommendation for a canal with inclined planes and submitted a petition to parliament on 18 February 1801. A petition for Dodd’s Grand Surrey Canal had already been submitted, and its proprietors petitioned against the Croydon canal bill in the House of Lords. As a result, the Croydon canal was changed to join the Grand Surrey Canal rather than the Thames. There were other petitions for and against the canal but the biggest effect was the petition from the Wandle mill owners. They were concerned that a deep cut across Croydon Common, between West Croydon and Selhurst would drain water into the canal instead of Norbury Brook and the River Wandle to the detriment of their mills. As a result the canal had raised banks across Croydon Common so it only cut into the soil and reduced its depth to . The summit level between Selhurst and Honor Oak Park was also raised further up the hillside. Despite these delays the canal received royal assent on 27 June 1801 via the (41 Geo. 3. (U.K.) c. cxxvii).

=== Inclined planes to locks ===
The decision to implement a canal with locks was made soon after the act of Parliament was passed, because &quot;it was realised the boats would be too small to meet the needs of the public, particularly the conveyance of large sized timber&quot;. The board realised there would be little cost advantage over toll-roads without larger 30-35 ton (30.5 - 35.6 tonnes) boats and traffic on the canal would be less than Rennie’s estimate of 5 boats in each direction. Trade was also threatened by the Surrey Iron Railway, which had received royal assent a month before the Croydon canal. Connection with the Grand Surrey Canal took boats close to the King’s Yard and victualing office at Deptford. These docks supplied the Royal Navy, but supply ships sailing along the coast to Portsmouth were liable to attack from the French and an inland navigation was desirable. In 1802, Rennie was commissioned to consider extending the canal to Portsmouth, but ultimately nothing became of it.

The adoption of locks required a water source for the canal to replace water lost when ascending / descending through the locks. Rennie’s original plan was to pump water from the Thames, which with the cost of the locks made it nearly £20,000 more expensive than a canal with inclined planes. The proprietors considered a deviation between Brockley and the Grand Surrey Canal so the ascent / descent would be less steep, take the canal closer to the King’s Yard and join the Grand Surrey at its southeast corner. This conflicted with plans for a branch of the Grand Surrey Canal to Deptford, and was objected to by their board. Instead, reservoirs were built at South Norwood and Sydenham. According to the resident engineer Dudley Clark the canal “&quot;is of itself so considerable, that, with the addition of a large reservoir upon Sydenham, and another upon Norwood Common, it leaves no doubt, of a most ample supply in the driest season.&quot;&quot; The reservoirs collected rainwater from the adjacent hillsides by ditches or feeder canals. Rainwater was also collected by ditches on Plowgarlic / Telegraph Hill above New Cross that fed into small reservoirs or side ponds at the locks.

=== Implementation ===
The canal was wide. It had a maximum depth of . After the initial flights of locks, most of the canal followed the contour.

The first 2¼ miles of the canal was dug approximately between today’s Penge West and Forest Hill railway stations. By 17 April 1804 tenders were invited for cutting the remaining 2 miles of the canal’s north end and contracts for the iron and woodwork on “&quot;upwards of 20&quot;” locks were received a month later. By October 1805 Sydenham reservoir had been completed, the canal was in water and in use from within a few miles of the town of Croydon to Brockley Green for conveying bricks, timber and other materials for the works. The Brockley locks were “&quot;well built and exceedingly water tight&quot;”. Closer to New Cross the canal was less complete and locks were in every stage of their progress. Around March 1807 a commodious bridge carried the New Cross Road over the canal at New Cross. Contrary to Rennie&#x27;s original plan there were also locks between New Cross Road and the Grand Surrey Canal.

The proprietors expected to join the Grand Surrey canal by July, having announced to the public that it would be open for navigation from the Thames to the crossroads at (South) Norwood. The canal was at least partially open by 15 August 1807. Hugh McIntosh, a major construction contractor, claimed he played a significant part in the canal’s construction.
Having already spent over £68,000 on the canal, the company required a further £30,000 to complete the works and repay the money borrowed. They petitioned Parliament on 10 February 1808 and were granted authority to raise the additional funds via the (48 Geo. 3. c. xviii) on 14 April 1808. Although the act did not increase the tolls, the minimum tonnage was increased from 4 to 20 tons when passing through a lock. Tenders were placed for bricks, building the basin wall at Croydon, fencing, a crane, counting house, warehouse and lock keeper’s cottage at Forest Wood. Despite raising the summit level, it was still lower than Croydon Common and a deviation between Selhurst and West Croydon was considered. Instead it was decided to raise the canal by two additional locks near Selhurst. These final two locks at Croydon Common raised the canal to the contour, and because there was no natural source of water a steam pumping station was built at the foot of the locks to pump water up to the summit pound. 

At around £300 p.a. this was expensive to run. In June 1830 a new pumping engine was installed on Croydon Common, which was the first commercial installation of Samuel Brown&#x27;s gas vacuum engine, and quite probably the first commercial internal combustion engine in the world. The economics of the gas engine were interesting as the gas it consumed was made by turning coal into coke. The value of the resulting coke and coal tar by-products of making the gas substantially exceeded the cost of the coal, ground rent, repairs etc., so the gas vacuum engine made a profit of over £100 a year before considering the useful work it was doing. Unlike a steam engine, which required time for the water to be heated into steam, Brown’s engine could be turned on and off almost instantly; it was typically used for 3 hours every other day. Around 1827 there was a steam engine near today’s Towpath Way, south of Tennison Road, Selhurst to pump water from a well or spring.

The canal had 28 locks, 11 more than Rennie planned (excluding the Thames lock): 10 near New Cross, 16 between Forest Wood (Honor Oak Park) and Brockley, and two near Selhurst. The locks would only admit boats long rather than long as originally proposed. Lock 26 near Honor Oak Park had three gates which could be used singly or in pairs, and would today be counted as two locks. Near the Thames, the Grand Surrey Canal became a dock which had a lock to protect the canal, and another at the Thames, making a total of 31 locks for the navigation from Croydon to the Thames.

=== Opening and third act of Parliament ===
The canal was officially opened on Monday 23 October 1809 with a procession that left Sydenham at 11am to a band playing &quot;God save the King&quot; and a 21 gun salute. The proprietor’s barge was followed by “&quot;a great many barges loaded with coal, stone, corn etc.&quot;”

At Croydon they were greeted by many thousands of people, church bells, guns firing and a band playing &quot;God save the King&quot;. The proprietors witnessed the arrival of the barges at the Croydon basin, examined the wharf and warehouses before walking to the Greyhound at 4pm, led by the workmen marching in order with their tools on their shoulders and accompanied by a band.
Despite the canal being opened, it was not complete. They had not built the road mentioned in clause 10 of their first act between Church Street and the Croydon wharf and in January 1810 they invited tenders for warehouses at Croydon, with more in August. A third act of Parliament, the (51 Geo. 3. c. xi) was sought and granted in 1811 to raise £80,000 (with £2,658 in hand) to pay off debts (£25,700), loans (£29,615) and complete the works (£27,343). The total cost of the canal and works was £150,000. Tenders for the road, and a tramway along its east side were sought. The tramway connected with the Croydon Merstham and Godstone railway and ran alongside the south side of the canal basis. It was open for business by January 1812 when it was leased to Edward Grantham. Other work included enlarging the reservoirs and building wharves at New Cross and Sydenham. Sydenham wharf was on the site of today’s Sydenham railway station on Sydenham Road and was initially leased to R Hutson on 22 December 1813. It was subsequently let to Henry Doo on 23 October 1824 until the canal closed when he was a successful coal merchant, lighterman and boat owner with an average trade of £700 p.a. Land owners were also entitled to build wharves (clause 102), which included Penge wharf on the north side of Penge High Street, near Penge West railway station.

=== Boats ===
By 1811, 22 barges plied the canal. The barges were long and wide and could carry about 30 tons. The main cargo was timber.

The barges, or strictly lighters,  had flat bottoms, which were joined to the sides of the boat by a quadrant of a circle to reduce damage to the canal bank. Depicted in several paintings, the barges had no living accommodation, were steered by a large rudder and pulled by a horse led along the towpath on the easterly side of the canal. At least initially, the docks on the Grand Surrey Canal near the Thames had no towpath. There was also no towpath on the Thames, which barges navigated using the tides, rudder and oar-like sweeps. Navigation through the pool of London was particularly dangerous because of the shipping, and in 1818 a Croydon canal bargeman was assaulted seeking shelter at a private mooring during tempestuous weather.

The boats had to be registered with the canal company and the number, name of the owner and abode had to be painted in white letters 4 inches high on a black background (clause 105). The canal company had its own barges, not only for the construction and maintenance of the canal, but also for its own freight carrier business that barely broke even. This was often prohibited in canal acts to reduce the risk of anticompetitive behaviour.

Pleasure craft also plied sections of the canal, to the benefit of several hostelries. The Selhurst lockkeeper, ‘old Grumble’, rented boats at a shilling (5p) an hour.

=== Trade ===
Dodd’s introductory report forecast revenues of more than £3,200, most of this was from the importation of coal via London:

Dodd believed the canal would stimulate demand by reducing transportation costs to a quarter to a third of those by road and extend trade to places as far away as East Grinstead. The committee did determine its own forecasts following Rennie’s report, but Phillips feared the lack of manufacturing towns, mines and heavy goods would prevent a proper return for investors.

Trade was boosted with the opening of the canal tramway by around £600 per annum with goods from Merstham quarry transported to the canal via the Croydon Merstham and Godstone iron railway. Toll revenues averaged about £2,700 between 1820 – 1824, but there were additional revenues from rents of about £350 p.a. and £80 p.a. from osier sales, as well as the freight business. This was comparable with Dodd’s estimate, but the capital cost was significantly higher. The tolls authorised by parliament were also higher, although the company may have set lower rates:

Profits and dividends were significantly less because of costs. In 1827 the canal made a profit of £196 on revenues of £3,634, which had steadily declined from a profit of £500 in 1825. There were calls to close the canal, but it was agreed to continue for another year without incurring further expense.

=== Closure and opening of the railway ===
The canal was never a success and closed in 1836, the first canal to be abandoned by an act of Parliament, the London and Croydon Railway Act 1835 (5 &amp; 6 Will. 4. c. x). Much of the alignment was used by the London and Croydon Railway Company, which had bought the canal for £40,250, for part of the railway between London Bridge and West Croydon station, which is on the site of the canal basin. The gas vacuum engine appears to have been in full working order when offered for sale in 1837. It was described as able to lift water a height of at a rate of . Tenders for its purchase (including the diameter gasometer) were to be sent to the offices of the Croydon Railway Company, which shared the same address as the London and Croydon Railway Company and dealt with the acquisition of the canal and disposal of any unwanted assets.

==Today==
After the canal closed, sections were retained for leisure use, and some remained in water for a considerable time. The section at the Anerley Arms, Ridsdale Road in Anerley was used as a boating lake, and the area was called Anerley Tea Rooms. The canal in Betts Park was turned into a concrete trough in 1934, approximately 170m can still be seen at the northern corner of Betts Park. Another section exists as a long curved pond in the Dacres Wood Nature Reserve in Dacres Road, Forest Hill. This was considered for redevelopment in 1989, but research by Lewisham Council resulted in its identity being confirmed and it now forms an attractive wetland, having been returned to its former width. There is a high pavement in David&#x27;s Road, Forest Hill, which is thought to be part of the towpath. Part of the wall below the path has been rebuilt with murals depicting transport in Forest Hill. The Norwood reservoir is now preserved as South Norwood Lake.

<text>Te-Oneroa-a-Tōhē / Ninety Mile Beach is on the western coast of the far north of the North Island of New Zealand. The beach is actually long. Its southern end is close to the headland of Tauroa Point, to the west of Ahipara Bay, near Kaitaia. From there it sweeps briefly northeast before running northwest along the Aupōuri Peninsula for the majority of its length. It ends at Tiriparepa / Scott Point, south of Cape Maria van Diemen and about south of Cape Reinga / Te Rerenga Wairua.

The beach is officially a public highway and is used as an alternative to State Highway 1 north of Kaitaia, though mainly for tourist trips, or when the main road is closed due to landslides or floods. The beach and the dunes at Te Paki in the north are a tourist destination. The Te Paki dunes, which look much like a desert landscape, are used for sandboarding.

== History ==
In the days of sailing ships a number of vessels were wrecked on the beach.

In 1932 the beach was used as the runway for some of the earliest airmail services between Australia and New Zealand.

Ninety Mile Beach was included as part of Te Araroa when it officially opened in 2011.

In a 2013 feature for the British television motoring programme &quot;Top Gear&quot;, Jeremy Clarkson drove the length of the beach in a Toyota Corolla as part of a race against an AC45 racing yacht crewed by British Olympic sailor Sir Ben Ainslie and the winning crew of the 2010 America&#x27;s Cup, with James May also on board.

==Name==
Te-Oneroa-a-Tōhē / Ninety Mile Beach is one of many places in New Zealand to have a dual name, consisting of both its former English name and its Māori name. This dual name was adopted in 2014 as a result of a Treaty of Waitangi settlement between the New Zealand government and Ngāti Kurī, an iwi based in the area around the beach. The Māori name for the beach translates as &quot;the long beach of Tōhē&quot;, referencing an early ancestor of Ngāti Kurī. The English portion of the dual name has unclear origins and is often the source of confusion, given that the beach is only long not ninety. A common story for the name holds that early Europeans took three days to traverse the beach, with their horses typically able to cover thirty miles per day. According to the legend, the Europeans took this to mean that the beach was 90 miles long, failing to account for their slower speed due to the sand.

After finishing his secondary studies, he entered the regional seminary of Dakar and was ordained a priest on 18 April 1949, did parish work for two years and then went to Rome for further study at the Pontifical Gregorian University. He returned to Senegal in 1953 and, after working as a chaplain to Catholic action groups, became parish priest of the Dakar cathedral in 1960 and Vicar General the following year.

On 20 May 1962 he was consecrated as Archbishop of Dakar by Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, his predecessor in the see. He was made a Cardinal-Priest by Paul VI in the Consistory of 24 May 1976, receiving the titular church of Santa Maria del Popolo.

Until 1987, he was president of the Bishops’ Conference of Senegal-Mauritania, and an elected member of the Council of the World Synod of Bishops. He has been the President of CEPACS (the Pan-African Episcopal Commission for Social Communications). He also took part in Vatican Council II.

<doc id="671909" wikidata="Q964833" url="?curid=671909" title="A. V. Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Hillsborough">
<text>Albert Victor Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Hillsborough (1 May 1885 – 11 January 1965) was a British Labour and Co-operative politician. He was three times First Lord of the Admiralty, including during the Second World War, and then Minister of Defence under Clement Attlee.

==Early life and career==
Born in Weston-super-Mare and one of four children, A. V. Alexander was the son of Albert Alexander, a blacksmith and later engineer who had moved from his native Wiltshire to Bristol during the agricultural depression of the 1860s and 1870s, and Eliza Jane Thatcher, daughter of a policeman. He was named after both his father and Prince Albert Victor, Queen Victoria&#x27;s eldest grandson, but he was known as &quot;A. V.&quot; from a young age. His parents had settled in Weston when they married, but the family moved to Bristol after Albert Alexander&#x27;s death in August 1886. Alexander&#x27;s mother worked as a corset-maker to provide for her children.

Alexander attended Barton Hill School from the age of three, at a cost of two pence per week. Against his mother&#x27;s wishes, he chose not to continue to St. George&#x27;s Higher Grade School in 1898, feeling the increased weekly charge of six pence was too expensive and that he would get nothing more from school. He began work aged thirteen, first for a leather merchant, and five months later as a junior clerk with the Bristol School Board. In 1903 he transferred to Somerset County Council&#x27;s newly formed local education authority, where he worked in the School Management Department as a committee clerk. He was by this time a keen chorister and footballer, and a self-taught pianist. In later years, and until his death, Alexander was a vice-president of Chelsea F.C.; his role at the club was taken on by Richard Attenborough.

Raised an Anglican, Alexander converted to the Baptist movement in 1908 after he married Esther Ellen Chapple, a school teacher and Baptist. They were married on 6 June 1908. Their daughter, Beatrix, was born in 1909, and their son Ronald lived from 1911 to 1912. Alexander joined the Weston Co-operative Society and became treasurer of the local Young Liberal Association in 1908, and the local Trades and Labour Council in 1909. He was elected to the board of the Weston Co-op Society in 1910.

==First World War==
He volunteered for service when the First World War began but was not called up until two years later. He joined the Artists Rifles, which principally served to train officers for assignment to other regiments. He trained in London and at Magdalen College, Oxford after he had been commissioned in the Labour Corps in December 1917. His health suffered during training, and he never saw active service but worked as a posting officer in Lancashire. In November 1918, he was promoted to captain, transferred to the General List and became an education officer, preparing wounded soldiers for civilian life. He was demobbed in late 1919. Within a year of returning home, he became vice-president of the Weston Co-op Society and secretary of the Somerset branch of NALGO.

==Parliamentary career==
In late 1920, Alexander applied for the position of Parliamentary Secretary to the Co-operative Union. He was selected out of 104 candidates, moving to London that November, and would hold the job until 1946. In this role, he directed the presentation of the Co-op&#x27;s position and interests to government bodies and Member of Parliament (MPs). In July 1921 he campaigned directly to MPs to oppose a clause in the government&#x27;s Finance Bill which would impose Corporation Tax on Co-ops. Lloyd George&#x27;s Coalition government, which had a large majority, was defeated by two votes. Shortly after this, the Sheffield branch of the Co-operative Party invited Alexander to be their Parliamentary candidate. He was duly elected for Hillsborough in November 1922, one of only four Co-op MPs. He was re-elected in 1923, 1924 and 1929. He would continue to represent Sheffield, with one break, until 1950.

In his maiden speech, Alexander criticised the Liberal Party for abandoning its progressive principles and championed economic theories that were central to the Labour Party&#x27;s manifesto. The Labour leadership accepted him as a spokesman on a number of issues, though the Co-op was not affiliated to the Labour Party until 1927. When Labour formed its first government in January 1924, Ramsay MacDonald made Alexander Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State to the Board of Trade, under Sidney Webb and Emmanuel Shinwell. Alexander&#x27;s responsibilities included the merchant navy, and answering Parliamentary Questions on all trade matters. The Co-op&#x27;s Parliamentary Committee had an acting secretary in Alexander&#x27;s place whilst he was in government, but he continued to take part in appeals to ministers.

After the government fell in October 1924, Alexander returned to working for the Co-op full-time. He became well known for his testimonies before government committees, and used the Co-op&#x27;s Parliamentary Committee to help co-ordinate responses to government action during the 1926 general strike. In Parliament, he became a front bench spokesman on trade, staunchly criticising the policies of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Winston Churchill. He also spoke on agriculture, local government and on social security, where he called for increased welfare, citing the suffering of his own constituents during the depression. In early 1929, Alexander applied for the position of General Secretary of the Co-operative Union, but was beaten by Robert Palmer. Within weeks, he became a member of the cabinet in the second Labour government.

==First Lord of the Admiralty==

Although many had expected Alexander to be appointed President of the Board of Trade, this position went to William Graham, protégé of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Snowden. Instead, Alexander became First Lord of the Admiralty, the only Labour member to hold this position as a cabinet rank. The Admiralty was a political power in its own right, and usually able to resist pressure from the Treasury and from Downing Street. MacDonald&#x27;s primary concern was international disarmament, and Alexander persuaded the Admiralty to reduce their demands for new cruisers as a prelude to negotiations aimed at ending naval rivalry with the U.S.. In January 1930, a conference between the five major naval powers (Britain, the U.S., France, Italy and Japan) was held in London. This resulted in the London Naval Treaty between Britain, America and Japan, to limit growth and maintain parity of their naval forces. In the spring of 1931, Alexander and the Foreign Secretary, Arthur Henderson, negotiated France and Italy&#x27;s entry into the treaty. Though Alexander came into conflict with the admiralty over expansion of the fleet, he defended it against criticism of its spending and staffing levels. He also introduced a system to make it easier for working-class recruits to become officers. During the economic crisis in mid-1931, Alexander supported Snowden&#x27;s defence of free trade against MacDonald and Henderson&#x27;s proposals for protectionism, but sided with Henderson against Snowden and MacDonald&#x27;s proposed cuts in government spending, especially unemployment benefit. He organised the cabinet opponents to the cuts, who advocated a socialist economy.

Faced with a cabinet split, the Prime Minister formed a coalition with the Conservative and Liberal parties. Snowden and a few other Labour MPs stayed with MacDonald, but the party went into Opposition. Alexander was prominent on the Opposition front bench, leading attacks on the government&#x27;s policies, but was careful not to exploit the widespread dissatisfaction with pay cuts in the armed forces (especially the Invergordon Mutiny), concerned that the military should not become involved in political matters. Effectively now number two after Henderson in the Parliamentary Labour Party, he was being talked of as a future leader. Both Alexander and Henderson lost their seats in the 1931 general election. Henderson was succeeded by George Lansbury, and Alexander&#x27;s contemporary, Clement Attlee, became deputy leader.

For the next four years, Alexander&#x27;s main role was again as the Co-op&#x27;s Parliamentary Secretary. He led opposition to renewed government plans to impose Corporation Tax on co-op stores, a fight that was lost this time with the 1933 Finance Bill. He also worked to have consumer interests represented on the new agricultural marketing boards. He was active in the Brotherhood movement (an organisation for nonconformists), spoke at rallies for the League of Nations, wrote columns for &quot;Reynold&#x27;s News&quot; and gave lectures on the BBC. Regaining his Hillsborough seat in 1935, Alexander became a front bench spokesman on trade and foreign affairs. Attlee, now leader of the PLP, asked him to join a new defence committee, working with Shinwell and Jack Lawson to reverse the pacifist ideals which had prevailed under Lansbury. Alexander had been warning of the dangers posed by fascism for several years, and criticised the government&#x27;s policy of appeasement. In 1937, with Hugh Dalton and Hastings Bertram Lees-Smith, he persuaded the PLP to put aside its mistrust of the Baldwin government and support the Service Estimates Bill which began rearmament. In October 1938, he closed the debate on the Munich Pact, attacking the government&#x27;s abandonment of the Sudeten Germans.

==Under Churchill and Attlee==
Following the outbreak of World War II, Alexander, like all leading Labour figures, opposed forming a coalition government under Neville Chamberlain. Alexander firmly believed that Winston Churchill should replace Chamberlain as Prime Minister. He worked with Arthur Greenwood, and against Herbert Morrison, who favoured Lord Halifax as successor, to convince Attlee and the party&#x27;s Executive to support Churchill. In the closing days of April 1940, Churchill met with Alexander, Clement Attlee and Sir Archibald Sinclair to discuss the possibilities for a coalition government. Halifax&#x27;s friend, Chips Channon, described this as Churchill prematurely forming his cabinet in the expectation of becoming PM. Two weeks later, on 10 May, Churchill was Prime Minister of a coalition government; after forming his War Cabinet, which included Attlee and Greenwood, he invited Alexander and Sinclair (Air), along with Anthony Eden (War, i.e. the Army), to head the three service ministries.

Alexander returned to the Admiralty as First Lord, but like the other service ministers, was dominated by Churchill and existed very much in his shadow. It was a measure of Churchill&#x27;s confidence in him that he was not given access to the secret information, nor was he allowed in the War Room. By appointing himself his own Minister of Defence, Churchill was well placed to exercise close supervision over the three services.

An example was Churchill&#x27;s decision to send Force Z including the battleship and the battlecruiser to Singapore without, as it transpired, adequate air support. Both Alexander and the First Sea Lord, Dudley Pound had vigorously opposed this deployment but were overruled by Churchill. This decision was made before Pearl Harbor – the ships were sent east as a deterrent to Japanese aggression, at the request of the Australian government and British forces in the Far East. Initially an aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Indomitable&quot; was included, but she ran aground in the Caribbean, and was not replaced by HMS &quot;Hermes&quot; which was regarded as too slow. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot; were attacked and sunk by Japanese aircraft off the Malayan coast immediately after the Pearl Harbor attack, before plans for their re-deployment in the light of actual hostilities with the Japanese could be decided upon and executed. Although Churchill had overall responsibility for the deployment, according to Richard Lamb, he &#x27;had no responsibility for the fate of these two battleships&#x27;. The Admiralty view, argued for by Alexander and Pound, was that the &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and the &quot;Repulse&quot; would have been better deployed in the Atlantic to counter the German threat from the German battleships &quot;Tirpitz&quot;, the &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and the &quot;Gneisenau&quot;.

Alexander performed his duties with energy and diligence. He was committed to the administrative duties of his role, often sleeping in his office, but also took a keen interest in the welfare of sailors. He joined an Arctic Convoy in 1942, and visited troops a few days after D-Day in 1944, the first British minister in France since the occupation in 1940. His radio broadcasts and public appearance boosted morale and made him very popular inside and outside the service. As a working-class politician in a top position, he was an important figure for national unity. He had regular meetings with Churchill when in London, acting as an advisor; they were good friends and Churchill arranged for Alexander to receive an Honorary Degree from the University of Bristol, of which Churchill was Chancellor. However, Alexander firmly supported Labour&#x27;s withdrawal from the coalition in May 1945, following victory in Europe. Campaigning in the election in July, he drew a sharp distinction between Churchill and the Conservative Party, suggesting that the Tories would sideline the wartime leader as they had done Lloyd George in 1922.

A member of the Cabinet following Labour&#x27;s victory, Alexander strongly supported the Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin, sharing his goals of maintaining Britain&#x27;s influence and opposing the Soviet Union. Britain&#x27;s wartime ally was admired at the time, and his outspoken criticisms of Russia lessened Alexander&#x27;s popularity. In 1946 he deputised for Bevin at the Paris Peace Conference, and was part of the Cabinet delegation to India, under Stafford Cripps, exploring possibilities for independence. At the end of 1946 he became Minister of Defence, a role previously held only by Churchill and Attlee when they were serving as Prime Minister. Responsible for all three armed services, he often clashed with the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Lord Montgomery. He was responsible for formulating the system of national service and faced a protracted fight against Labour backbenchers who opposed the continuation of conscription in peacetime. In January 1947 he was one of six ministers on the Gen 75 Committee that secretly authorised Britain&#x27;s nuclear programme; in March he was in the negotiations for the Treaty of Dunkirk, laying the foundations for NATO. As the Cold War began, Alexander&#x27;s criticisms of the USSR gained wider acceptance. In 1948 he became a Freeman of the City of Sheffield.

==Leader in the Lords==
A. V. Alexander decided not to seek re-election in the 1950 general election. He retired from the Commons and was raised to the peerage as Viscount Alexander of Hillsborough, of Hillsborough in the City of Sheffield, three months before his sixty-fifth birthday. For practical reasons, the Minister of Defence needed to be a member of the Commons, and Emmanuel Shinwell succeeded to this role. However, Alexander retained a seat in the Cabinet as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Although he never made it into the &quot;top five&quot; of the Labour government (Attlee, Bevin, Morrison, Dalton and Greenwood, later replaced by Cripps), he remained an influential member throughout. Out of office following Labour&#x27;s defeat and his health starting to decline, Alexander retired from front-bench politics after the 1951 general election. He bought a farm in Essex and, although he continued to attend the House of Lords, he did not hold any front-bench briefs for the next four years. In December 1955, following the resignation of Lord Jowitt, Alexander was asked by Hugh Gaitskell to take over as leader of the small group of Labour peers. His appointment was strongly supported by Labour&#x27;s faction in the upper House, and he served in this role for the next nine years.

Alexander spoke on virtually every topic whilst leading the Opposition in the Lords. He supported the introduction of life peers, calling for them to be paid so that such appointments would be practical for working-class people. He also supported Tony Benn&#x27;s campaign to renounce his peerage, and opposed Britain&#x27;s early attempts to join the European Economic Community. Now a celebrity within the Co-op movement, Alexander continued to lobby for it in Parliament and with members of the government. In 1956 he became President of the UK Council of Protestant Churches. He often spoke on religious matters in the Lords, fiercely opposing closer relations between the Church of England and the Catholic Church and often quoting scripture at Lords Spiritual. He was created Baron Weston-super-Mare, of Weston-super-Mare in the County of Somerset, and Earl Alexander of Hillsborough in 1963 – the last man to be made an earl until Harold Macmillan became Earl of Stockton in 1984 – and was appointed a Knight Companion of the Garter in 1964. He finally stood down as leader of the Labour peers in the run-up to the general election in October 1964. His last appearance in the Lords was shortly before Christmas that year, when he fiercely defended Harold Wilson&#x27;s foreign policy from Tory accusations of disloyalty. Aged 79, Lord Alexander of Hillsborough died early in the new year, fourteen days before Winston Churchill. The peerages died with him as he had no sons.

<text>Bill Graham (born Wulf Wolodia Grajonca; January 8, 1931 – October 25, 1991) was a German-born American impresario and rock concert promoter.

In the early 1960s, Graham moved to San Francisco, and in 1965, began to manage the San Francisco Mime Troupe. He had teamed up with local Haight Ashbury promoter Chet Helms to organize a benefit concert, then promoted several free concerts. This eventually turned into a profitable full-time career and he assembled a talented staff. Graham had a profound influence around the world, sponsoring the musical renaissance of the 1960s from its epicenter in San Francisco. Chet Helms and then Graham made famous the Fillmore and Winterland Ballroom; these turned out to be a proving grounds for rock bands and acts of the San Francisco Bay area including the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, and Big Brother and the Holding Company with Janis Joplin, who were first managed, and in some cases developed, by Helms.

==Early life==
Graham was born on January 8, 1931, in Berlin, Germany. He was the youngest child and only son of lower middle-class Jewish parents, Frieda (&quot;née&quot; Sass) and Jacob &quot;Yankel&quot; Grajonca, who had emigrated from Russia before the rise of Nazism. There were six children in the Grajonca family. His father died in an accident two days after Graham was born. Graham&#x27;s family nicknamed him &quot;Wolfgang&quot; early in life.

Due to the increasing Nazi persecution of Jews and the death of Jacob, Graham&#x27;s mother placed her son and her youngest daughter, Tanya &quot;Tolla&quot;, in a Berlin orphanage, which sent them to France in a pre-Holocaust exchange of Jewish children for Christian orphans. Graham&#x27;s older sisters Sonja and Ester stayed behind with their mother.

After the Fall of France in 1940, Graham was among a group of Jewish orphans spirited out of France, some of whom finally reached the United States. Tolla Grajonca came down with pneumonia and did not survive the difficult journey. Graham was one of the One Thousand Children (OTC), mainly Jewish children who managed to flee Nazi Germany and Europe and come directly to North America, but whose parents were forced to stay behind. Graham&#x27;s mother died on the way to Auschwitz concentration camp.

At age 10, he settled into a foster home in the Bronx, New York. After being taunted as an immigrant and being called a Nazi because of his German-accented English, Graham worked on his accent, eventually being able to speak in a perfect New York accent. He changed his name to sound more &quot;American&quot;. (He found &quot;Graham&quot; in the phone book—it was the closest he could find to his birth surname, &quot;Grajonca&quot;. According to Graham, both &quot;Bill&quot; and &quot;Graham&quot; were meaningless to him.) Graham graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School and then obtained a business degree from the City College of New York. He was later quoted as describing his training as that of an &quot;efficiency expert&quot;.

Graham was drafted into the United States Army in 1951, and served in the Korean War, where he was awarded both the Bronze Star and Purple Heart. Upon his return to the States he worked as a waiter/maître d&#x27; at resorts in the Catskill Mountains in upstate New York during their heyday. He was quoted saying that his experience as a maître d&#x27; and with the poker games he hosted behind the scenes was good training for his eventual career as a promoter. Tito Puente, who played some of these resorts, went on record saying that Graham was avid to learn Spanish from him, but only cared about the curse words. Graham also mentions in his bio-pic &quot;Last Days At The Fillmore&quot; once working for Minnesota Mining.

==Career==
===Fillmore Auditorium (December 10, 1965 – July 4, 1968)===
Graham moved from New York to San Francisco in the early 1960s to be closer to his sister Rita. He was invited to attend a free concert in Golden Gate Park, produced by Chet Helms and the Diggers, where he made contact with the San Francisco Mime Troupe, a radical theater group. After Mime Troupe leader R. G. Davis was arrested on obscenity charges during an outdoor performance, Graham organized a benefit concert to cover the troupe&#x27;s legal fees. The concert was a success and Graham saw a business opportunity.

Graham began promoting more concerts with Chet Helms and Family Dog projects, which provided a vital function of the 1960s, promoting concerts that provided a social meeting place to network, where many ideologies were given a forum, sometimes even on stage, such as peace movements, civil rights, farm workers and others. Most of his shows were performed at rented venues, and Graham saw a need for more permanent locations of his own.

Charles Sullivan was a mid-20th-century entrepreneur and businessman in San Francisco who owned the master lease on the Fillmore Auditorium. Graham approached Sullivan to put on the Second Mime Troupe appeals concert at the Fillmore Auditorium on December 10, 1965, using Sullivan&#x27;s dance hall permit for the show. Graham later secured a contract from Sullivan for the open dates at the Fillmore Auditorium in 1966. Graham credits Sullivan with giving him his break in the music concert hall business.

The Fillmore trademark and franchise has defined music promotion in the United States for the last 50 years. From 2003 to 2013 auxiliary writers of the times surrounding the 1960s, and Graham family lawsuits, tell the narrative of the Fillmore phenomena and how the Black community there was disenfranchised. The best way to set the historic record straight concerning Charles Sullivan and Bill Graham is to review what Graham left in his own words. Historically the first time Graham mentioned Charles Sullivan, in print, was in a &quot;Bay Area Music&quot; article from 1988:

Although Graham acknowledged Sullivan&#x27;s part he historically has never revealed how he got the lease to the Fillmore Auditorium and how and when he trademarked the Fillmore brand, which by all historical accounts belonged to Sullivan. In a handbill from Graham&#x27;s first show at the Fillmore Auditorium, &quot;The Mime Troupe is holding another appeal party Friday night, December 10th, at the Fillmore Auditorium&quot;, Bill Graham gives a general impression of the Fillmore neighborhood:

Mime Troupe leader R. G. Davis states that, &quot;Graham... got very excited about the success of the Fillmore Auditorium Show. He got a contract with the black guy who owned the Fillmore. He nails it. Closed.&quot; On pages 150–156 of his autobiography, Graham outlined his battles with City Hall in getting a dance hall permit. By schmoozing with merchants and having criminologists and sociologists from U.C. Berkeley and U.C. Santa Cruz giving merit to the shows Graham managed to obtain a second permit hearing, but was again denied. He reported that Sullivan came to him sometime in March or April and announced he had to pull his dance hall permit. The morning of the next day, when Graham was returning to move out of his office in the Fillmore Auditorium, Sullivan met him on the steps. Graham claimed Sullivan poured out his life story, concluding with a pledge of support to Graham to beat City Hall. Graham added, &quot;He was the guy, Charles. He was it. I don&#x27;t know if I could have ever found another place. Why would I have even tried? That was the place.&quot;

Graham was denied by the Board of Permit Appeals who refused to overrule the first denial. Graham then stated, &quot;Then on April 21, 1966, a Thursday, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; ran an editorial, &#x27;The Fillmore Auditorium Case&#x27; ... [I]t was a big turning point for me. In more ways than one&quot;; he secured his permit.

Charles Sullivan was found shot dead at 1:45 am on August 2, 1966, at 5th and Bluxome Streets, San Francisco (South of Market industrial area near the train station). Sullivan had just returned from Los Angeles, where he had presented a weekend concert starring soul singer James Brown. The police have never determined whether Sullivan&#x27;s death was suicide or homicide.

Sullivan was laid to rest on August 8, 1966, according to the &quot;Sun Reporter&quot;, which reported that &quot;Last respects were paid Charles Sullivan Monday, Aug. 8, when hundreds crowded into Jones Memorial Methodist Church, 1975 Post St. from 11:30 a.m. to view Sullivan for the last time. An enormous crowd had gathered by 1 p.m. to hear the eulogy for a friend.&quot; The funeral announcement is accompanied by photographs of the actual funeral covering two pages in which police are stopping traffic to assist the motorcade to the cemetery in Colma. Graham later reported, &quot;Charles Sullivan got himself killed. He had a bad habit of always carrying a roll of money with him. He was proud of his work and proud of the fact that he earned a good living and always carried a roll. He was jumped and stabbed to death. I went to his funeral in Colma, California. It was small, mostly family. Had that not happened, I think I would have done anything Charles wanted. Just out of gratitude.&quot;

After Graham&#x27;s death on October 25, 1991, the description of his funeral procession states:
&quot;The Sun Reporter&quot; noted:
According to the historical record, Sullivan also gave the Fillmore Auditorium its name.

Graham&#x27;s struggle to get his dance hall permit in 1966 was described in an article in &quot;Billboard Magazine&quot;, July 11, 1966. San Francisco music critic Ralph Gleason, in defense of Graham&#x27;s Fillmore Auditorium scene, wrote that Graham got a three-year lease for the Fillmore Auditorium from Charles Sullivan and was still struggling to procure his dance hall permit, a fact never publicly revealed by Graham. Charles Sullivan&#x27;s last show at the Fillmore Auditorium came a week before his death, on July 26, 1966, The Temptations Dance and Show. Graham must have gotten his permit in mid-July 1966, confirming his possession of the Fillmore brand.

It was unknown how Graham had taken over the Fillmore lease until the 2004 publication of Hendrik Hertzberg&#x27;s &quot;Politics Observations &amp; Arguments (1966-2004)&quot;. It contains an article, &quot;The San Francisco Sound, New music, new subculture&quot;, at the end of which it stated, &quot;Unpublished file for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, October 28, 1966&quot;. This article contains the only published account of how Graham acquired the Fillmore. In the beginning, Hertzberg recounts familiar territory with the Mime Troupe, reducing the Fillmore Auditorium to a run-down ballroom in &quot;SF&#x27;s biggest negro ghetto.&quot; After the success of the Fillmore Auditorium Mime Troupe shows, Graham parts ways with the Troupe: &quot;He went back to the Fillmore and found that eleven other promoters had already put in bids for it. Graham got forty-one prominent citizens to write letters to the auditorium&#x27;s owner, a haberdasher named Harry Shifs, and Shifs gave him a three-year lease at five hundred dollars a month... [T]he hippie community ... has turned out to be something the man from Montgomery Street can point to with pride, in a left-handed way, and say &#x27;these are our boys&#x27;&quot;&quot;, stated Jerry Garcia.

One of the early concerts Graham sponsored, with Chet Helms hired to promote it, featured the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. The concert was an overwhelming success and Graham saw an opportunity with the band. Early the next morning, Graham&#x27;s secretary called the band&#x27;s manager, Albert Grossman, and obtained exclusive rights to promote them. Shortly thereafter, Chet Helms arrived at Graham&#x27;s office, asking how Graham could have cut him out of the deal. Graham pointed out that Helms would not have known about it unless he had tried to do the same thing to Graham. He advised Helms to &quot;get up early&quot; in the future. Graham produced shows attracting elements of America&#x27;s now-legendary 1960s counterculture such as the Jefferson Airplane, Big Brother and the Holding Company, Country Joe and the Fish, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, the Committee (improv_group), The Fugs, Allen Ginsberg, and a particular favorite of Graham&#x27;s, the Grateful Dead. He was the manager of the Jefferson Airplane during 1967 and 1968. His staff&#x27;s amount of resourcefulness, success, popularity, and personal contacts with artists and fans alike was one reason Graham became the top rock concert promoter in the San Francisco Bay Area.

===Fillmore Records, West, East, and later===
Graham owned Fillmore Records, which was in operation from 1969 to 1976. Some of those who signed with Graham included Rod Stewart, Elvin Bishop, and Cold Blood, although of these it seems only Bishop actually issued albums on the Fillmore label. Tower of Power was signed to Bill Graham&#x27;s San Francisco Records and their first album, &quot;East Bay Grease&quot;, was recorded in 1970.

By 1971, Graham citing financial reasons and changes he saw as unwelcome in the music industry, closed the Fillmore East and West, claiming a need to &quot;find [himself]&quot;. The movie &quot;Fillmore&quot; and the album &quot;&quot; document the closing of the Fillmore West. Graham later returned to promoting. He began organizing concerts at smaller venues, like the Berkeley Community Theatre on the campus of Berkeley High School. He then reopened the Winterland Arena (San Francisco), along with the Fillmore West, and promoted shows at the Cow Palace Arena in Daly City and other venues. 

In 1973 he did the staging for Jimmy Koplic and Shelly Finkle&#x27;s promotion of the Summer Jam at Watkins Glen rock festival at Watkins Glen, New York with The Band, Grateful Dead, and The Allman Brothers Band. Over 600,000 paying ticket-holders were in attendance. He continued promoting stadium-sized concerts at Kezar Stadium in San Francisco with Led Zeppelin in 1973 and 1977 and started a series of outdoor stadium concerts at the Oakland Coliseum each billed as &quot;Day on the Green&quot; in 1973 until 1992. These concerts featured billings such as the Grateful Dead and The Who on October 9, 1976, and the Grateful Dead and Bob Dylan in 1987.

His first large-scale outdoor benefit concert, at Kezar Stadium, on Sunday, March 23, 1975, &quot;SF SNACK&quot;, was organized to replace funds for after-school programs canceled by the San Francisco Unified School District, with performances by Bob Dylan, Neil Young, members of The Band and Grateful Dead, Jefferson Starship, Mimi Fariña, Joan Baez, Santana, Tower of Power, Jerry Garcia &amp; Friends, The Doobie Brothers, Eddie Palmieri &amp; His Orchestra, The Miracles, Graham Central Station, and appearing : Marlon Brando, Francis Ford Coppola, Frankie Albert, John Brodie, Rosie Casals, Werner Erhard, Cedric Hardman, Willie Mays, Jesse Owens, Gene Washington, Cecil Williams

Graham as &quot;Bill Graham Presents&quot; booked the 1982 US Festival, funded by Steve Wozniak as &quot;Unuson&quot;. In the mid-1980s, in conjunction with the city of Mountain View, California, and Apple Inc. cofounder Steve Wozniak, he masterminded the creation of the Shoreline Amphitheatre, which became the premier venue for outdoor concerts in Silicon Valley, complementing his booking of the East Bay Concord Pavilion. Throughout his career, Graham promoted benefit concerts. He went on to set the standard for well-produced large-scale rock concerts, such as the U.S. portion of Live Aid at JFK Stadium, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on July 13, 1985, as well as the 1986 A Conspiracy of Hope and 1988 Human Rights Now! tours for Amnesty International.

Graham purchased comedy club The Punch Line and The Old Waldorf on Battery Street in San Francisco from local promoter Jeffrey Pollack, with whom he remained close friends for the rest of his life, then Wolfgang&#x27;s on Columbus Ave in San Francisco.

==Personal life==

=== Family ===
Bill Graham had five sisters, Rita Rose; Evelyn (or &quot;Echa&quot;) Udray; Sonja (or &quot;Sonia&quot;) Szobel; Ester Chichinsky; and Tanya (or &quot;Tolla&quot;) Grajonca, however his youngest sister Tolla died of pneumonia while fleeing the Holocaust. Rita and Ester moved to the United States and were close to Graham in his later life. Evelyn and Sonja escaped the Holocaust, first to Shanghai, and later, after the war, to Europe. Graham&#x27;s nephew and Sonia Szobel&#x27;s son is musician Hermann Szobel.

Graham married Bonnie MacLean on June 11, 1967, and they had one child, David (born 1968); after many years of not living together the couple divorced in 1975. With Marcia Sult Godinez, Graham had another son; Alex Graham-Sult and a stepson, Thomas Sult.

=== Home estate ===

The residence Jake Ehrlich designed with a sliding glass roof at the top of Camino Alto Road in Marin County, in Northern California, was later owned by Graham. 

For many years Graham lived in Corte Madera, California, on an 11-acre estate with a ranch-style house he named &quot;Masada&quot; after the ancient mountain fort in Israel with the same name, Masada. The house was replaced in the early 2000s, and later occupied by WeWork CEO, Adam Neumann.

=== Bitburg controversy ===

Graham&#x27;s status as a Holocaust survivor came into play in 1985, during the presidency of Ronald Reagan. When Graham learned that Reagan intended to lay a wreath at Bitburg&#x27;s World War II cemetery where SS soldiers were also buried, he took out a full-page ad in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; in protest. During the same month that Reagan visited the cemetery, Graham&#x27;s San Francisco office was firebombed by Neo-Nazis. Graham was in France at the time, meeting with Bob Geldof to organize the first Live Aid concert. Graham eventually led an effort to build a large menorah which is lit during every Hanukkah in downtown San Francisco.

=== Acting ===
Graham had long dreamed of being a character actor. He appeared in &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; in a small role as a promoter. In 1990, he was cast as Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano in the film &quot;Bugsy&quot;. During one scene, he is shown in a Latin dance number, a style of dancing Graham had embraced as a teenager in New York. He also appears as a promoter in the 1991 Oliver Stone film &quot;The Doors&quot;, which he also co-produced. He had a small part in &quot;Gardens of Stone&quot; as Don Brubaker, a hippie anti-war protester.

==Death==
Graham died in a helicopter crash west of Vallejo, California, on October 25, 1991, while returning home from a Huey Lewis and the News concert at the Concord Pavilion. He had attended the event to discuss promoting a benefit concert for the victims of the 1991 Oakland hills firestorm. Once he had obtained a commitment from Huey Lewis to perform, he departed by helicopter, which collided with a high-voltage tower in Marin County, California. Fatalities included Graham, pilot and advance man Steve &quot;Killer&quot; Kahn, and Graham&#x27;s girlfriend, Melissa Gold (née Dilworth), ex-wife of author Herbert Gold.

==Aftermath and tributes==
Following his death, his company, Bill Graham Presents (BGP), was taken over by a group of employees. Graham&#x27;s sons remained a core part of the new management team. The new owners sold the company to SFX Promotions, which in turn sold the company to Clear Channel Entertainment. The BGP staff did not embrace the Clear Channel name, and several members of the Graham staff eventually left the company. Former BGP President/CEO Gregg Perloff and former Senior Vice President Sherry Wasserman left and started their own company, Another Planet Entertainment. Eventually Clear Channel separated itself from concert promotion and formed Live Nation, which is managed by many former Clear Channel executives.

Live Nation is now the world&#x27;s largest concert production/promotion company and is no longer legally affiliated with Clear Channel or the names Winterland or Winterland Productions.

In tribute, the San Francisco Civic Auditorium was renamed the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium. On November 3, 1991, a free concert called &quot;Laughter, Love and Music&quot; was held at Golden Gate Park to honor Graham, Gold and Kahn. An estimated 300,000 people attended to view many of the entertainment acts Graham had supported including Santana, the Grateful Dead, John Fogerty, Robin Williams, Journey (reunited), and Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young (reunited). The video for &quot;I&#x27;ll Get By&quot; from Eddie Money&#x27;s album &quot;Right Here&quot; was dedicated to Graham. Graham&#x27;s images and poster artwork still adorn the office walls at Live Nation&#x27;s new San Francisco office. With the band Hardline, Neal Schon of Journey composed a piece entitled &quot;31–91&quot; in 1992 in Graham&#x27;s honor. 

Bill Graham was inducted into the &quot;Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&quot; in 1992 in the &quot;Non-Performer&quot; category. Graham was inducted into the Rock Radio Hall of Fame in the &quot;Without Whom&quot; category in 2014.

<text>Ronald Allen (15 January 1929 – 9 June 2001) was an English international football player and manager. He was a professional footballer for nineteen years, between 1946 and 1964, making 638 appearances in the Football League and scoring 276 goals. He also won five caps for the England national team. He later became a manager at clubs in England, Spain, Portugal, and Greece. His son, Russell, also played professional football throughout the 1970s.

Starting his career in 1946 with Port Vale, he spent four years with the club before making a record-breaking transfer to West Bromwich Albion. He was one of the best strikers of the 1950s, playing over 400 games, with a ratio of a goal every two games. He lifted the FA Cup in 1954, and helped the club to the FA Charity Shield in 1954, and a second-place finish in the First Division in 1953–54. In 1961 he signed with Crystal Palace, where he spent the final four years of his playing career. He helped Palace win promotion out of the Third Division in 1963–64.

His management career began in 1965 with Wolverhampton Wanderers, as he led Wolves out of the Second Division in 1966–67. In 1969, he took up the reins at Spanish club Athletic Bilbao, leading the club to a second-place finish in La Liga in 1969–70. In 1972, he was appointed manager of Portuguese club Sporting Lisbon; after one season with the club, he moved back to England to manage Walsall for a brief period. In 1977, he spent a short time as manager of West Bromwich Albion. After a spell advising the Saudi Arabia national team, he took charge of Greek club Panathinaikos for a short time in 1980. His last management position was back at West Brom in 1981–82, following which he served the club as a coach and scout.

==Club career==

===Youth teams===
Ronald Allen was born on 15 January 1929 in Fenton, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. He attended Hanley High School. Despite playing for the school rugby team, his preferred sport was football. He turned out for his local Boys&#x27; Brigade team and, later, Wellington Scouts. He then moved on to Northwood Mission, where he played at outside-right, alongside Bill McGarry and Basil Hayward, who would later become his teammates at Port Vale. Allen scored 57 goals for the Mission in the 1943–44 season.

===Port Vale===
Allen signed amateur forms with Port Vale in December 1944 at the age of 15. He made his full debut on 2 April 1945 in a 2–2 draw against Wrexham in the Football League North, playing at outside-right and laying on one of Vale&#x27;s goals. At this point in his life he was a mere and weighed under 8 stone (50 kg). He scored his first goal for the club in a 4–3 win against Norwich City in August 1945, and in March 1946 signed as a part-time professional, for which he received a £10 signing-on fee. The 1946–47 season was the first full season of competitive football in England following the end of the Second World War; Allen made his Football League debut on 7 September 1946 in a 2–1 defeat to Exeter City. Due to his national service commitments, he only made 18 appearances during that season, scoring five goals. He was the club&#x27;s top scorer in the 1947–48 season with 13 goals.

Allen joined the Royal Air Force early in 1947 and represented their football team several times. He was demobbed on 1 June 1949. In total, he played 156 games for the club (including wartime appearances), scoring 40 goals.

===West Bromwich Albion===

Allen was transferred to West Bromwich Albion on 2 March 1950 for £20,000, a club record fee for both clubs at the time. This was more than double the previous Albion record, set when Jackie Vernon was brought to the club three years earlier. Allen scored on his debut two days later to secure a 1–1 draw against Wolverhampton Wanderers in a First Division match. The attendance of 60,945 remains a record for a league game at The Hawthorns. Though only and barely , he emerged as a talented striker, helping to define the modern role of target man. Signed by Jack Smith, he was soon converted from a wide player into a centre-forward. Allen also benefited from the ultra-modern training techniques of Jesse Carver, who served Albion as manager for a brief time in the 1952–53 campaign. Carver&#x27;s successor, Vic Buckingham, also had a Total Football philosophy and appreciated the technical skill Allen possessed, allowing him to play as a deep-lying attacker with room to dribble at will – a revolutionary position and tactic.

Davy Walsh, the club&#x27;s top-scorer since the war, was sold on to Aston Villa in December 1950 for a £25,000 fee. Allen managed to fill the attacking void and formed a deadly partnership with Johnny Nicholls, feeding poacher Nicholls many of the 58 league goals he scored between 1951 and 1957. Allen became the club&#x27;s top-scorer for three successive seasons, hitting ten goals in 1950–51, 32 goals in 1951–52, and twenty goals in 1952–53. His run was interrupted by Nicholls, who became the top-scorer in 1953–54, as the club recorded a second-place finish in the league. During the campaign, Allen scored against former club Port Vale in the FA Cup semi-final and then scored twice against Preston North End in the 1954 final, which Albion won 3–2. He then scored a hat-trick in the 1954 FA Charity Shield at Molineux, ensuring a 4–4 draw with league champions and Black Country rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers. He was First Division top scorer in 1954–55 with 27 goals, though the &quot;Baggies&quot; struggled in the league, finishing a disappointing seventeenth.

He became the club&#x27;s top-scorer for a fifth and final time in 1955–56, hitting the net seventeen times. Allen&#x27;s transfer record was broken in March 1956, when the club paid Fulham £25,000 for Bobby Robson. The club reached the FA Cup semi-finals again in 1956–57, only to lose out to eventual winners Aston Villa, following a replay. Albion managed to improve their league form in 1957–58, finishing fourth, as Robson and Derek Kevan&#x27;s strike partnership replaced that of Allen&#x27;s and Nicholls&#x27;. Though Nicholls departed, Allen remained a key member of the first-team, as West Brom finished fifth in 1958–59; he further enhanced his legendary status at Albion by scoring the equaliser late in the game against Aston Villa to send Albion&#x27;s biggest rivals down. New manager Gordon Clark led West Brom to a fourth-place finish in 1959–60, which was followed by a tenth-place finish in 1960–61.

He scored a total of 234 goals in 458 appearances for West Brom, making him the second-highest scorer in the club&#x27;s history, behind Tony Brown. This record also makes him eighth in the club&#x27;s all-time appearance charts.

===Crystal Palace===
Allen was sold on to Crystal Palace for a £4,500 fee in May 1961. Under Arthur Rowe&#x27;s stewardship, the &quot;Glaziers&quot; finished 1961–62 fifteenth in the Third Division. Dick Graham then took the reins for the rest of Allen&#x27;s time at Selhurst Park, as the club struggled in mid-table in 1962–63, only to win promotion as runners-up in 1963–64. Although his appearances in 1963–64 were restricted by injury (to 27), he was officially captain of the side that season. After scoring a Second Division goal in 1964–65, he became the only player to score a Football League goal in the first twenty consecutive seasons of post-war football. He left Crystal Palace in March 1965 at 36, having scored 34 goals in 100 league games for the club.

==International career==
Allen made his England debut at the age of 23, in a 3–0 friendly win against Switzerland in Zürich on 28 May 1952. He had to wait almost two years for his second cap, which came against Scotland on 3 April 1954, the same day that his club West Bromwich Albion were playing rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers in a vital First Division match. Allen scored with a header in the second half to help England beat the Scots 4–2 in the match at Hampden Park, and also had another headed goal disallowed. He also appeared against Yugoslavia, and was included in England&#x27;s initial squad for the 1954 FIFA World Cup, but did not make the final travelling party. He nevertheless earned two further caps, the first of which was a 3–2 win against Wales in a British Home Championship game, and the last of which was against West Germany on 1 December 1954. Allen scored from out in a 3–1 Wembley win against the World champions. He was again overlooked in the selection for the 1958 FIFA World Cup. He was seen to be too far ahead of his time. On his lack of England caps, Allen himself said, &quot;No two people see the game the same way and everyone is entitled to his own judgement&quot;. Albion teammate Frank Griffin stated that &quot;There was too much emphasis put on height for England strikers. They all had to be like Lawton and be over 6ft. He should have played for England more, there was no doubting Allen&#x27;s sheer skill. That should have been enough.&quot;

In addition to scoring two goals in five full internationals, he also appeared twice for the England B team; both matches took place in 1954. He also scored twice for England B when they beat a Sheffield XI 5–4 in October 1957. However, this match is not included in the England B records compiled by RSSSF. Allen travelled with England to the 1958 and 1982 World Cups as the team&#x27;s official interpreter.

==Style of play==
Allen was a skilful and intelligent forward player who used his speed rather than his physique to get the better of opposition defenders. He was an accomplished passer of the ball, able to make pinpoint through passes at both short and long range. He had fantastic vision on the ball, and could play with both feet. He also had a powerful shot, was an accomplished penalty taker, and could volley the ball with ease. The official West Brom website describes Allen as &quot;the complete footballer&quot;, and compares him to the Hungarian legend Ferenc Puskás.

==Managerial career==
In March 1965, Allen joined Wolverhampton Wanderers as senior coach, working under manager Andy Beattie. Following Beattie&#x27;s departure, Allen replaced him as manager in September 1965, just after their relegation to the Second Division. He signed quality players, bringing names such as Derek Dougan and Mike Bailey to Molineux. He guided them to promotion in 1966–67, and Wolves consolidated their top-flight status in 1967–68. However, he was sacked in November 1968, and replaced by former Port Vale teammate Bill McGarry.

Allen took up the post of manager at Spanish club Athletic Bilbao in the summer of 1969, replacing Rafael Iriondo. He led Athletic to the runners-up spot in La Liga in 1969–70, as they finished one point behind Atlético Madrid. In 1970–71 the &quot;Lions&quot; finished fifth, eight points behind champions Valencia CF. He remained at the club until November 1971, leaving shortly after being eliminated from the UEFA Cup by Eintracht Braunschweig.

He was appointed manager at Portuguese side Sporting CP for the 1972–73 campaign. He was sacked before the end of the season due to a poor showing in the Primeira Liga – the club ended up in fifth place, equalling their worst-ever finish, despite the goalscoring form of Héctor Yazalde. Champions S.L. Benfica won 28 of their 30 league games. Despite their league form, new manager Mário Lino did lead Sporting to their ninth Taça de Portugal success after defeating Vitória 3–2 at the Estádio Nacional.

He returned to the Midlands to take up the management reins at Walsall in July 1973. However, he spent just six months in charge at Fellows Park. The &quot;Sadders&quot; finished the 1973–74 campaign fifteenth in the Third Division. He returned to West Bromwich Albion as a scouting advisor in January 1977 before being installed as manager six months later. He recommended the club sign Cyrille Regis, who would become the club&#x27;s main striker for the next seven years and part of the &quot;Three Degrees&quot; with Brendon Batson and Laurie Cunningham. He stepped down in December, to take up the financially lucrative post as advisor to the Saudi Arabia national football team. He returned to management in June 1980, this time at Greek club Panathinaikos. Again he enjoyed only a short reign, and was gone within six months. In his absence, the &quot;Greens&quot; finished fifth in the Superleague Greece.

He returned to the Hawthorns as manager again in July 1981, succeeding Ron Atkinson – who had just moved to Manchester United. Two of Albion&#x27;s finest players, Remi Moses and Bryan Robson, soon joined Atkinson at Old Trafford, and this hurt Albion&#x27;s previously good league fortunes. He signed Steve MacKenzie, Andy King, Martin Jol, and Romeo Zondervan; none of whom would prove particularly effective. Albion did well in the cup competitions, reaching the semi-finals of both the FA Cup and the League Cup, although they suffered an early exit from the UEFA Cup. But Allen could not put together a good run of form in the First Division, and Albion only stayed up after winning their final game of the season. He then ended his managerial career in May 1982, choosing instead to work as the club&#x27;s general manager. He stepped down from this post in June 1983, though he continued to coach and scout for the club during his retirement until 1996. He even played in a testimonial match at Cheltenham in 1995, at the age of 66.

==Personal life and legacy==
His autobiography, &quot;It&#x27;s Goals That Count,&quot; with a foreword by Vic Buckingham, was published in 1955. He had a son, Russell Allen, who started his career at West Brom, before playing close to 300 league games at Tranmere Rovers and Mansfield Town between 1971 and 1981.

Ronnie Allen died suffering with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease on 9 June 2001 in Hardwick Court Nursing Home, Great Wyrley, Staffordshire. West Bromwich Albion&#x27;s pre-season friendly against Athletic Bilbao later that summer was designated as the &quot;Ronnie Allen Memorial Match&quot;, in recognition of his contribution to both clubs. A minute&#x27;s silence was held before kick-off and proceeds from the match donated to the Alzheimer&#x27;s Society, a disease he had been diagnosed with in later life. Allen had himself played and scored the only goal for West Brom in a testimonial match for Athletic&#x27;s long serving player Agustín Gaínza in 1958, and while managing the Spanish side in 1971 he had arranged two friendlies between the clubs for the benefit of Bobby Hope and José Ángel Iribar.

In 2004 Allen was named as one of West Bromwich Albion&#x27;s 16 greatest players, in a poll organised as part of the club&#x27;s 125th anniversary celebrations.

<text>Dia Art Foundation is a nonprofit organization that initiates, supports, presents, and preserves art projects. It was established in 1974 by Philippa de Menil, the daughter of Houston arts patron Dominique de Menil and an heiress to the Schlumberger oil exploration fortune; art dealer Heiner Friedrich, Philippa&#x27;s husband; and Helen Winkler, a Houston art historian. Dia provides support to projects &quot;whose nature or scale would preclude other funding sources.&quot;

Dia holds a major collection of work by artists of the 1960s and 1970s, on view at Dia Beacon that opened in the Hudson Valley in 2003. Dia also presents exhibitions and programs at Dia Chelsea in New York City, located at 535, 541 and 545 West 22nd Street. In addition to its exhibition spaces at Dia Beacon and Dia Chelsea, Dia maintains and operates a constellation of commissions, long-term installations, and site-specific projects, notably focused on land art, nationally and internationally. Dia&#x27;s permanent collection holdings include artworks by artists who came to prominence during the 1960s and 1970s, including Joseph Beuys, Dan Flavin, Donald Judd, Agnes Martin, and Andy Warhol. The art of this period represented a radical departure in artistic practice and is often large in scale; it is occasionally ephemeral or site-specific.

Currently, Dia commissions, supports, and presents site-specific installations and long-term exhibitions of work by these artists, as well as those of younger generations.

==History==
===Early years===
Heiner Friedrich was a German art dealer with galleries in Munich and Cologne which showed artists such as Andy Warhol, Cy Twombly, Donald Judd, and Dan Flavin. In 1973, Friedrich moved his galleries to New York City at 141 Wooster Street, now the site of &quot;The New York Earth Room&quot;. That year Friedrich traveled to Houston to visit the Rothko Chapel where he met Dominique de Menil&#x27;s assistant Helen Winkler and was reintroduced to her daughter Philippa de Menil. Friedrich and Philippa de Menil would later both get divorces so they could marry each other in a 1979 Sufi ceremony and get a marriage license in 1982.

Friedrich, Winkler, and Philippa de Menil founded Dia in 1974. The goal of the organization was to fund artists creating work on scales or with underlying natures that the funding sources of the time could not support. Friedrich&#x27;s plan was to create a funding system similar to patronage systems from the Renaissance. Robert Whitman, a performance artist funded by Dia, stated that Friedrich &quot;wanted to make a Sistine Chapel, create a Shakespeare.&quot; Friedrich himself stated that, &quot;The 20th century clearly stands beside the Renaissance as one of the most powerfully visual ages. We have artists of the magnitude of Titian, be it Andy Warhol; of the magnitude of Michelangelo, be it Dan Flavin; of the magnitude of Donatello, be it Walter De Maria. This is why we did Dia.&quot; Friedrich had the vision and art contacts, while Philippa de Menil was heir to the Schlumberger oil fortune and had the money to support the idea. Philippa de Menil&#x27;s husband, Francesco Pellizzi, was on the original six-member board, and Dominique and Christophe de Menil were on the advisory council.

Dia got its name from the Greek word &quot;dia&quot; which means &quot;conduit.&quot; Friedrich explained the name choice with &quot;&#x27;Dia&#x27; was chosen as a transitory term for an institution that would not be eternal but would make possible the presence of artworks on an extended, long-term basis&quot; Dia first patronized a group of artists that included Donald Judd, Dan Flavin, John Chamberlain, Walter De Maria, La Monte Young, and Marian Zazeela. These artists received stipends, studios, and archivists in anticipation of one-man museums that Dia planned for several of them. Dia stayed away from press and was not well known through the &#x27;70s. The goal was for Dia to not have an identity and be a true &quot;conduit&quot; for the art works it was funding without adding themselves to it. An article by Phoebe Hoban in New York Magazine in 1985 called the foundation a &quot;closely guarded secret&quot; during this time period, references people calling it &quot;the art Mafia,&quot; and notes that the organization didn&#x27;t even have a letterhead.
Following a series of performance works and temporary exhibitions at Friedrich&#x27;s gallery in SoHo, including the &quot;Dream Festival&quot; by La Monte Young and Marian Zazeela, Dia installed its first public artwork in 1975 at the Kunstmuseum Basel, in Basel, Switzerland. This artwork, &quot;Untitled (In memory of Urs Graf)&quot; by Dan Flavin, was installed in the museum&#x27;s courtyard and consists of fluorescent tubes in varying colors outlining the space. This was followed in 1976 by a retrospective of six theater pieces by Robert Whitman

In 1977 Friedrich&#x27;s gallery space was transformed into a permanent exhibition of Walter De Maria&#x27;s &quot;The New York Earth Room&quot; and Dia&#x27;s offices were moved to 107 Franklin Street. Dia planned the opening of three other works in 1977: Walter De Maria&#x27;s &quot;The Vertical Earth Kilometer&quot; in Kassel Germany, and &quot;Lightning Field&quot; in New Mexico, as well as a permanent, multicolored, light installation by Dan Flavin stretching across three platforms at Grand Central Terminal in New York. The same year Dia purchased a volcanic crater in Arizona for James Turrell for his &quot;Roden Crater&quot; project (and later gave him approximately six million dollars to move the project forward).In 1979 the second location of Friedrich&#x27;s gallery space, 393 West Broadway, was also given over to Walter De Maria for a permanent art installation, The Broken Kilometer.

Dia continued purchasing buildings to create one-man museums, and in some cases living quartets, for their roster of artists. Starting in 1979, the foundation hired architect Richard Gluckman and started looking for reinforced-concrete structures suitable for showing art. With his help 1979 saw the purchase and renovation of multiple sites including a former firehouse and church for the Dan Flavin Art Institute, Dick&#x27;s Castle in Garrison, New York (which was purchased for $1 million but later discovered was too expensive to renovate), and the Mercantile Exchange at 6 Harrison Street for Young and Zazeela to create &quot;Dream House&quot; (Dia spent approximately $4 million on buying and renovating the building and gave Young and Zazeela a budget of $500,000 a year for upkeep and artmaking.) This buying spree continued into the 1980s with the purchase of a building on West 19th street in 1980 for Robert Whitman spending $495,000 on the building and handing out $250,000 a year to Whitman for upkeep and art making, and the 1981 purchase of a former bank building in Winchendon, Massachusetts for Fred Sandback to create a one-man museum in. The year 1980 also saw Dia open the Masjid al-Farah (later Dergah al-Farah), a Sufi lodge replete with Flavin light works and living quarters for Sheikh Muzaffer Ozak al-Jerrahi, in a former firehouse at 155 Mercer Street. The opening of the Sufi lodge was a reflection of de Menil&#x27;s recent conversion to the path of Sufi Islam and later ascension as spiritual guide to the Nur Ashki Jerrahi Order of New York City. Over this same time Friedrich and de Menil purchased the shuttered Fort D.A. Russell in Marfa, Texas, renamed it &quot;The Art Museum of the Pecos,&quot; and planned to house works for multiple artists Dia funded. The 350 acres, now known as the Chinati Foundation, was conceived by Donald Judd who was given $17,500 a month as a salary and installation payment for the museum.

In the first ten years, Dia was spending up to $5 million a year on less than twelve artists, funding art commissions and living expenses for individual artists between $2,500 and $17,500 a month. The foundation spent over $30 million in less than 10 years amassing over 900 works and a small real estate empire. By 1981 Dia owned about $14 million worth of artwork and $15 million in real estate. Over 1980 and 1981 it spent about $19 million supporting artists and their work. These first years of Dia are marked with management issues, including paying taxes on properties that could be tax exempt and other extravagant spending. Philippa de Menil summed up how fast Dia did so much with &quot;The reason we accomplished so much in terms of projects is that we just forged ahead and didn&#x27;t worry about overspending.&quot;

===Financial issues and restructuring===
Between 1980 and 1982, the Schlumberger oil stock cratered, going from about $87 a share to about $30. This drastic cut to de Menil&#x27;s fortune forced Dia to begin tightening the purse strings with its artists. Artists were sent details about how to spin their projects off into independent foundations. In 1983, Donald Judd was informed that his brainchild in Marfa was being delayed, and he was advised to turn it into an independent foundation. Things got so bad financially for Dia in 1983 they were forced to take out a $3.87 million loan from Citibank using de Menil&#x27;s Schlumberger stock as collateral. This prompted The New York state attorney general to begin an investigation into the foundation&#x27;s practices and Judd threatened to sue Dia for breach of contract

1985 saw a shake up in Dia&#x27;s board due to the financial issues and Judd&#x27;s threatened lawsuit. Heiner Friedrich left the board and Philippa de Menil&#x27;s financial support ended and her money was placed into a trust, although she remained a board member. Philippa de Menil&#x27;s mother, Dominique de Menil, stepped in, and installed Ashton Hawkins, an executive vice president at the Metropolitan Museum, as Dia&#x27;s chairman. Along with Hawkins, the new board members included Lois de Menil, John C. Evans, future United States Supreme Court justice Stephen Breyer, Margaret Douglas-Hamilton, and Herbert Brownell. Lois de Menil summed up the financial distress Dia was in with &quot;We were absolutely appalled at the state of acute financial distress...There was a $5-million Citibank debt to pay, projected costs of $5-million, no operating budget, and no visible income.&quot;

The night before the new board was set to meet, Sheikh Muzaffer Ozak al-Jerrahi of the Sufi lodge Dia funded, passed away in Istanbul, Turkey. Philippa de Menil (now Fariha Fatima al-Jerrahi) ominously reflected on the passing of her spiritual guide saying, &quot;His death seemed to herald many new changes.&quot;

The new board began slashing at Dia contracts and real estate to get the budget under control with projects being dropped and dismantled at a fast rate. The mosque was removed from 155 Mercer Street to 245 West Broadway. La Monte Young and Marian Zazeela had to leave the Harrison Street building, which was then sold for $5.5 million. Artists were outraged and threatened to sue. La Monte Young said, &quot;The new board treated us like criminals, like terrorists... they took ten years of our lives away.&quot; and Dan Flavin remarked about the de Menil&#x27;s that, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter who gets hurt in order to hold up the family reputation.&quot;

An auction of works from Dia&#x27;s holdings was held in 1985 at Sotheby&#x27;s including pieces by Cy Twombly, Andy Warhol, and Donald Judd and raised approximately $1.3 million causing an outcry from those artists still connected to Dia. The foundation restructured and refocused on a new purpose as an institution. A fundraising campaign began to start an endowment that would fund a drastically reduced operating budget, approximately $800,000 a year. Dia began showing works from its collection in public for the first time, starting with a show of Cy Twombly paintings. The financial difficulties during the 1980s reduced Dia&#x27;s annual expenditures from $5 million in 1984 to 1.2 million in 1987. By the end of 1987, real-estate and art sales had brought in about $17 million to pay the debt and start an endowment. The foundation was renamed the Dia Center for the Arts and a programme of poetry readings, performances, lectures and publications was begun.

===Collecting new works and renovating spaces===
In 2015 Jessica Morgan joined Dia as the new director. While Dia holds works by under 50 artists, Morgan focused new collecting on works by women and international artists to diversify the largely white and male collection. This push culminated in the acquisition of &quot;Sun Tunnels&quot; by Nancy Holt. Morgan also ended the drive to build a new building in Chelsea and instead focused on joining three buildings the Foundation already owns and using raised funds to support the endowment. A $78 million capital campaign was announced in June 2018 and the target was raised to $90 million in May 2019. When asked about this sudden change from building a new building to a much smaller scope of construction in an interview in Artnet Morgan explained, &quot;We&#x27;re very different from the Guggenheim or MoMA, where we think of specific buildings as being the landmark institutions. Dia has always followed a different route, which was finding spaces where the artists could share their vision with us.&quot; The New Dia Chelsea is scheduled to reopen in the fall of 2020 followed by updates, renovations, and expansions at other spaces under the Dia purview. A new gallery will open in SoHo in a retail space Dia has rented out for 10 years, of gallery space at Dia Beacon will be opened, and the climate control systems for &quot;The New York Earth Room&quot; and &quot;The Broken Kilometer&quot; will be overhauled so the works can remain open all year. These physical updates to buildings Dia owns are planned to use less than 25% of the funds raised from the capital campaign.

==Locations and sites==

There are twelve locations and sites which the Dia Art Foundation considers part of its constellation of art museums and long-term installations. Dia breaks its holdings into two distinct categories: locations and sites. &quot;Locations&quot; include museum structures that contain galleries of smaller works either on permanent or temporary display, while &quot;sites&quot; are long-term art installations placed outside of the gallery context that have been either commissioned or acquired by Dia.

Dia Beacon, Riggio Galleries in Beacon, New York, is located in a former printing plant built in 1929 by Nabisco. When it opened in 2003 with of exhibition space, it became one of the largest museums to open in the United States since the Museum of Modern Art opened in the late 1930s.

Each gallery was designed specifically for the art it contains. The space is limited to the works of 25 artists, including Richard Serra&#x27;s monumental steel sculptures &quot;Torqued Ellipses&quot; and Michael Heizer&#x27;s &quot;North, East, South, West&quot; (1967/2002). The museum&#x27;s galleries of paintings by On Kawara, Agnes Martin, Blinky Palermo, and Robert Ryman receive reflected north light from more than of skylights.

Dia collaborated with Robert Irwin and architect OpenOffice to formulate the plan for the museum building and its exterior setting. The grounds include an entrance court, and parking lot with a grove of flowering fruit trees and a formal garden, both of which were designed by Irwin.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, it cost $50 million to build, with Leonard Riggio contributing at least $35 million of that amount; the remainder of the construction funds came from the Lannan Foundation ($10 million), Ann Tenenbaum and her husband Thomas H. Lee ($2.5 million), among others. As of 2007 its annual operating costs are about $3 million a year.

====Dia Bridgehampton====


Dia Bridgehampton, previously known as the Dan Flavin Art Institute, is a museum in Bridgehampton, New York opened in 1983 to house nine fluorescent light works by Dan Flavin on permanent display. Besides the permanent exhibit, there is also a gallery for temporary exhibitions and a display on the history of the building.

====Dia Chelsea====

Dia began its presence on West 22nd Street in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City in 1987 with the opening of the Dia Center for the Arts at 548 West 22nd Street. Dia Chelsea has since moved across the street to a series of three connected buildings now consolidated at 537 West 22nd Street which host longterm but temporary exhibitions as well as associated artistic and educational programing. It is one of the locations and sites the Dia Art Foundation manages.

===Sites===
Michael Govan, the former director of Dia under whose direction Dia Beacon was constructed, estimates that before Philippa de Menil&#x27;s family forced her to sharply cut back on funding—an act precipitated by the 1980s oil glut&#x27;s effect on the Schlumberger fortune—Dia spent &quot;at least $40 million&quot; on a series of installations that Dia continues to maintain.

Among those 1970s and early 1980s projects are works by Walter De Maria, including &quot;The Lightning Field&quot; (1977), near Quemado, New Mexico; and &quot;The New York Earth Room&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Broken Kilometer&quot; (1979), in New York City.

The 9 sites are:

* &quot;7000 Oaks&quot; by Joseph Beuys in New York City
* &quot;Depreciation&quot; by Cameron Rowland in Edisto Island, South Carolina
* &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot; by Robert Smithson in the Great Salt Lake at Rozel Point, Utah 
* &quot;Sun Tunnels&quot; by Nancy Holt in Great Basin Desert, Utah 
* &quot;The Broken Kilometer&quot; by Walter De Maria in New York City
* &quot;The Lightning Field&quot; by Walter De Maria in Quemado, New Mexico 
* &quot;The New York Earth Room&quot; by Walter De Maria in New York City
* &quot;The Vertical Earth Kilometer&quot; by Walter De Maria in Kassel, Germany 
* &quot;Times Square&quot; by Max Neuhaus in New York City

==Permanent collection==
Over Dia&#x27;s first ten years, its founders assembled a collection of a select group of artists. Among those whose work was commissioned and collected at that time are Joseph Beuys, John Chamberlain, Walter De Maria, Dan Flavin, Donald Judd, Imi Knoebel, Blinky Palermo, Fred Sandback, Cy Twombly, Robert Whitman, and La Monte Young. In 1979 the Dia Art Foundation acquired &quot;Shadows&quot; (1978–79), the monumental painting installation by Andy Warhol consisting of 102 canvases, as a single entity from the artist during its inaugural exhibition at the Heiner Friedrich Gallery in New York.

In 1991 Dia gave the Menil Collection in Houston six of its best works by Twombly in anticipation of the Twombly Gallery that opened there in 1995. In anticipation of the opening of Dia Beacon, Dia augmented its core collection with focused acquisitions. The first of these was made in 1997, when Board Chairman Leonard Riggio and his family gave the Foundation three sculptures from Richard Serra&#x27;s &quot;Torqued Ellipses&quot; series (1996–97), sculptures created for an exhibition at Dia Chelsea; it was the first acquisition for Dia&#x27;s permanent collection in over ten years, a $2 million purchase made by Riggio. With support from the Lannan Foundation, the artists themselves, and others, the collection has expanded with gifts, purchases, and long-term loans of works by other artists from that same generation—Bernd and Hilla Becher, Louise Bourgeois, Hanne Darboven, Michael Heizer, Robert Irwin, On Kawara, Sol LeWitt, Agnes Martin, Bruce Nauman, Gerhard Richter, Robert Ryman, Robert Smithson, and Lawrence Weiner—as well as additional works by artists already represented.

In recent years, Dia has focused on broadening its collection to spotlight a more diverse and international mix of artists. Female artists who have been added to the permanent collection include Mary Corse, Nancy Holt, Dorothea Rockburne, Michelle Stuart and Anne Truitt. In 2017, Dia acquired work by Kishio Suga and Lee Ufan, bringing seminal work from the 1960s Mono-ha movement in Japan into the collection to promote greater understanding of work being made internationally during this period. In 2017, Robert Ryman, a key Dia artist, donated 21 of his works to the institution, making Dia&#x27;s Ryman holdings unparalleled in any other public collection.

===Deaccessioning===
In 1985, Dia Art Foundation for the first time auctioned off 18 works at Sotheby&#x27;s, including pieces by Cy Twombly and Barnett Newman, for $1.3 million. In 2013, the foundation announced its plan to sell another group of paintings and sculptures — including pieces by Twombly, Chamberlain and Barnett Newman — at Sotheby&#x27;s, this time hoping to raise at least $20 million for an acquisition budget and to pay for 30 works that have been on long-term loan to Dia from the Lannan Foundation. In response, founders Heiner Friedrich and Fariha de Menil filed suit in New York Supreme Court, seeking an injunction against the foundation and Sotheby&#x27;s while raising the possibility that some of the works might not be legally owned by Dia but constitute long-term loans from the Friedrichs. However, the lawsuit was dropped shortly after, and the consigned works raised $38.4 million.

==Affiliates==
Alongside managing 12 locations and sites, Dia also maintains relationships with 6 affiliate institutions. Dia collaborates with and supports these institutions financially, and through donations or sharing of artworks, particularly in the early stages of each organization&#x27;s development. One of the affiliates, &quot;Roden Crater&quot; by James Turrell, while being partially funded and supported by Dia since the 70&#x27;s, is still not completed.

The installation of work by Donald Judd and John Chamberlain, in Marfa, Texas, was begun by Judd; Dia gave the project $4 million between 1980 and 1986, before cutting off the financial support due to Dia&#x27;s financial crisis; a lawsuit threatened by Judd led to the establishment of the Chinati Foundation with support from Dia. &quot;

The affiliate institutions are:
* Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
* Chinati Foundation in Marfa, Texas 
* &quot;City&quot; by Michael Heizer in Garden Valley, Nevada
* Cy Twombly Gallery in Houston, Texas
* &quot;Dream House&quot; by La Monte Young and Marian Zazeela in New York City
* &quot;Roden Crater&quot; by James Turrell in Painted Desert, Arizona

==Sam Gilliam Award==
In 2023, the Sam Gilliam Award was established at the Dia Art Foundation by Gilliam’s foundation and his widow, Annie Gawlak, with plans to give out the prize annually for a decade:
* 2024 – Ibrahim Mahama

==Funding==
The Dia Art Foundation is a tax-exempt charitable organization. Current programs are supported in part by funds from the members of the Board of Trustees, foundations (such as the Lannan Foundation and the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts), and other friends of the institution. As of 2013, Dia&#x27; endowment stands at around $55 million.

==Board of trustees==
Among others, the Dia Art Foundation&#x27;s board includes collectors Frances Bowes and Howard Rachofsky. Under new director Jessica Morgan&#x27;s leadership, the Greek shipping magnate George Economou, investor and philanthropist Jeffrey Perelman, and Ra Hee Hong Lee, Irene Panagopoulos, Jane Skinner and James Murdoch joined. Artist trustees have included Brice Marden, Robert Ryman, and George Condo.

<text>Portuguese Guinea (), called the Overseas Province of Guinea from 1951 until 1972 and then State of Guinea from 1972 until 1974, was a Portuguese overseas province in West Africa from 1588 until 10 September 1974, when it gained independence as Guinea-Bissau.

==Slave trade==

The Portuguese Crown commissioned its navigators to explore the Atlantic coast of West Africa in the 1430s, to find sources of gold. At that time the gold trade was controlled by Morocco. Muslim caravans across the Sahara also carried salt, kola, textiles, fish, grain, and slaves. The navigators first passed the obstruction of Cape Bojador in 1437 and were able to explore the West African coast as far as Sierra Leone by 1460 and colonize the Cape Verde islands beginning in 1456.

The gold ultimately came from the upper reaches of the Niger and Volta Rivers and the Portuguese crown wanted to divert the gold trade to the coast. To control the gold trade, the Portuguese king ordered a castle built, called São Jorge da Mina (now Elmina Castle), on the Portuguese Gold Coast in 1482 along with other trading posts. The Portuguese government founded the Company of Guinea to trade and set the prices of goods, including gold and ivory, Melegueta pepper and slaves. The Atlantic slave trade transported an estimated eleven million people from Africa between 1440 and 1870, including two million from Senegambia and Upper Guinea.

This area was the source of an estimated 150,000 African slaves transported by the Portuguese before 1500, mainly from Upper Guinea. Some were used to grow cotton and indigo in the previously uninhabited Cape Verde islands. Portuguese traders and exiled criminals penetrated the rivers and creeks of Upper Guinea,
forming a mulatto population speaking a Portuguese-based Creole language as a lingua franca. However, after 1500 most Portuguese interest, both for gold and slaves, centered further south in the Gold Coast.

At the beginning of the 17th century, the Portuguese exported slaves from Upper Guinea from Santiago in Cape Verde, and those from the Gulf of Guinea from São Tomé Island. In the 1630s and 1640s, the Dutch drove the Portuguese from most of the Gold Coast. The Portuguese did retain a foothold at São João de Ajuda in Benin, now called Ouidah, since before the 1750s they preferred to acquire slaves from the Gulf of Guinea rather than Upper Guinea. In the 17th century, the French established bases at Saint-Louis, Senegal, the English at Kunta Kinteh Island on the Gambia River and Dutch at Gorée.

The very weak Portuguese position in Upper Guinea was strengthened by the first Marquess of Pombal who promoted the supply of slaves from this area to the provinces of Grão-Pará and Maranhão in northern Brazil. Between 1757 and 1777, over 25,000 slaves were transported from the “Rivers of Guinea”, which approximated Portuguese Guinea and parts of Senegal, even though this area had been largely neglected by the Portuguese for the previous 200 years. Bissau, founded in 1765, became the centre of Portuguese control.

British interest in the area led to a brief attempt in the 1790s to establish a base on the island of Bolama, which showed no evidence of continuous Portuguese presence. The British settlers pulled back in 1793 and the Portuguese officially occupied the island in 1837. Even after the Portuguese claim in 1837, Afro-Portuguese lived and worked there alongside Afro-British from Sierra Leone, since Britain did not relinquish its claim to Bolama until 1870.

The abolition of the slave trade by Britain in 1807 gave the slave traders of Guinea a virtual monopoly over the West Africa slave trade with Brazil. Although the Brazilian and Portuguese governments agreed in the 1830s to stop this traffic, it probably continued at 18th-century levels until after 1850, when the British pressured Brazil to enforce its existing ban on the import of slaves. The last significant consignment of West African slaves reached Brazil in 1852.

==Later colonial period==

Britain&#x27;s interest in the Upper Guinea region declined with the end of the British slave trade in 1807 and became focused on Sierra Leone after the Boloma Island settlement was abandoned. At the start of the 19th century, the Portuguese felt reasonably secure in Bissau and regarded the neighboring coastline as their own. Their control was tenuous: for much of the 19th century the Portuguese presence in Guinea was mainly limited to the rivers of Guinea, the settlements of Bissau, Cacheu and Ziguinchor (the last now in Senegal). Elsewhere it was preserved, with little official assistance, by local Creole people and Cape Verde islanders, who owned small plantations (Pontus).

The existence of plantations run by the French and Senegalese brought a risk of French claims south of the Casamance River. After the Berlin Conference of 1885 introduced the principle of effective occupation, negotiations with France led to the loss of the valuable Casamance region to French West Africa. In exchange, the French agreed to Portuguese Guinea&#x27;s boundaries.

Portugal occupied half a dozen coastal or river bases, controlling some maritime trade, but not much of the population. However, in 1892, Portugal made Guinea a separate military district, to promote its occupation. Had the doctrine of effective occupation been as prominent in 1870 as after 1884, Portugal might also have lost Bolama to Britain. However, Britain and Portugal agreed in 1868 to international arbitration. President Ulysses S. Grant of the United States of America acted as arbiter, and in 1870 awarded the island to Portugal.

Portugal&#x27;s precarious financial position and military weakness threatened its ability to retain its colonies. In 1891, António José Enes, Minister of Marine and Colonies, rationalized taxes and granted concessions in Guinea, mainly to foreign companies, to increase its exports. The increased revenue was intended to fund a gradual expansion of control that would give Portugal tax revenue from trade and the indigenous people. The modest increase in government income between 1895 and 1910 did not cover the cost of the troops used to impose the taxes, however. Enes&#x27; policies largely failed; resistance continued in the interior, on the islands, and at the coast. However, once military occupation had begun, Portugal persisted, hoping for future benefits.

After the Portuguese monarchy fell in 1910, the new republic set up a ministry for colonial administration. Guinea&#x27;s income increased as peanut prices rose, tax collection improved and its budget showed a surplus. Between 1913 and 1915, João Teixeira Pinto used Askari troops to impose Portuguese rule and crush resistance to the hut tax by destroying villages and seizing cattle, causing many to flee to Senegal or into the forests. The cost of maintaining his forces and the resulting budget deficits led to his recall in 1915.
Although the First World War increased world demand for tropical products and stimulated Guinea&#x27;s economy, a post-war slump, and frequent political crises created a deep recession. By the 1926 military uprising in Portugal, most of Guinea was occupied, administered, and taxed, but its revenue was not enough to pay for its administration, much less to expand it. When the &quot;Estado Novo&quot; imposed police on the Bissagos Islands in 1935–36, it completed its control of Guinea.

Between the 1930s and 1960s, the colony was a neglected backwater, whose only economic significance was to supply Portugal with about one-third of its vegetable oil, from peanuts. It was unclear if its population of about 500,000 in 1950 was large enough to grow enough peanuts to pay for its imports and administration, and still grow food for its population. In 1951, because of anti-colonialist criticism in the United Nations, the Portuguese government renamed all of Portugal&#x27;s colonies, including Portuguese Guinea, as overseas provinces (&quot;Províncias Ultramarines&quot;).

Development was largely neglected before the start of the country&#x27;s independence war. One paternalistic governor, Sarmento Rodrigues, promised to develop agriculture, infrastructure, and health, but did little to fight the upsurge in sleeping sickness in the 1940s and 1950s. Guinea saw little public investment in the first Portuguese Overseas Development Plan (1953–58), and a second plan (1959–64) concentrated on its towns. Adequate rural health clinics were not provided until General Spínola&#x27;s program of 1968–73. Public education provided was limited: in 1959 Guinea had some 200 primary schools with 13,500 pupils and 36 post-primary schools, mainly for the children of Portuguese citizens and urban assimilados, with 1,300 pupils. These schools were never particularly accessible to native inhabitants, and only around nineteen percent of school-age children attended primary school. Literacy rates suffered, with an estimated 99 percent of the population illiterate in 1950, making Guinea the most illiterate Portuguese territory in Africa.

==Independence movement==
The fight for independence began in 1956, when Amílcar Cabral founded the &quot;African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde&quot; (PAIGC). At first, PAIGC organised a series of strikes by urban workers, especially those working in the port and river transport. But on 3 August 1959, fifty striking dockworkers were killed, and after this, the PAIGC changed strategy, avoiding public demonstrations and concentrating instead on organising the rural peasants. In 1961, after a purely political campaign for independence had made little progress, the PAIGC adopted guerrilla tactics.

While heavily outnumbered by Portuguese troops (approximately 30,000 Portuguese to some 10,000 guerrillas), the PAIGC had safe havens over the border in Senegal and Guinea, both recently independent of French rule. The conflict in Portuguese Guinea between the PAIGC guerrillas and the Portuguese Army was the most intense and damaging of the Portuguese Colonial War, and several communist countries supported the guerrillas with weapons and military training.

In 1972 Cabral set up a government in exile in Conakry, the capital of neighbouring Guinea. He was assassinated there outside his house, on 20 January 1973.

By 1973 the PAIGC controlled most of the interior of the country, while the coastal and estuary towns, including the main population and economic centres remained under Portuguese control. The PAIGC guerrillas declared the independence of Guinea-Bissau on September 24, 1973, in the town of Madina do Boe in the southeasternmost area of the territory, near the border with neighbouring Guinea.

After the Carnation Revolution military coup in Lisbon on 25 April 1974, the new revolutionary leaders of Portugal and the PAIGC signed an accord in Algiers, in which Portugal agreed after a series of diplomatic meetings to remove all troops by the end of October and to officially recognize the government of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau controlled by the PAIGC, on 26 August 1974. Demobilized by the departing Portuguese military authorities after the 1974 Carnation Revolution in Lisbon and the independence of Portuguese Guinea, a total of 7,447 Guinea-Bissauan African soldiers who had served in Portuguese native commando forces and militia were summarily executed by the PAIGC. Marcelino da Mata, a Portuguese Army officer born in Portuguese Guinea, known for bravery and heroism in the Portuguese Colonial War, who had participated in 2412 commando operations and became the most decorated Portuguese military officer in the history of the Portuguese Army, managed to escape this fate only because he was in mainland Portugal for medical care.

==Economy==
===Early colonial economy===
In the 1430s trade from West Africa was controlled by Muslim states on Africa&#x27;s northern coast. Muslim trade routes across the Sahara, which had existed for centuries, transported salt, kola, textiles, fish, grain, and slaves.

As the Portuguese extended their influence along the coasts of Mauritania, Senegambia by 1445 and Guinea, they created trading posts. Rather than directly competing with the Muslim traders, they increased trade across the Sahara.

There was only a very small market for African slaves as domestic workers in Europe, and as workers on the sugar plantations of the Mediterranean. However, the Portuguese found they could make considerable amounts of gold transporting slaves from one trading post to another along the Atlantic coast of Africa. The Portuguese found Muslim traders entrenched along the African coast as far as the Bight of Benin, and Muslim merchants had a high demand for slaves to serve as porters on the trans-Saharan routes, and to sell in the Islamic Empire.

For most of the period of Portuguese involvement, the people of Portuguese Guinea were subsistence farmers. By the 19th century, the coastal Balanta people, who lived outside Portuguese control, had developed a sophisticated agricultural system, growing paddy-rice in reclaimed coastal swamps. Much of this rice was exported to surrounding territories, particularly after indigenous rice was replaced by imported varieties. The Balanta also participated in the slave trade in this period. Another crop developed in this period was peanuts, and peanut exports from Portuguese Guinea began in the mid-19th century. As intensive plantation cultivation led to reduced soil fertility, peanuts were normally grown by peasants in Portuguese-controlled areas, who mixed them with food crops and maintained fallow periods.

===Later colonial economy===
Before the Estado Novo period, Portugal was weak internationally and stronger powers forced it to adopt free trade policies in its colonies. The Estado Novo replaced free trade with protectionism and state economic intervention. The colonies were to provide Portugal with raw materials, foreign exchange, taxes and labour, and absorb its manufactures and surplus people. Although Guinea produced some rubber at the end of the 19th century, its main exports were vegetable oils and Balanta rice. It had a small domestic market and was unattractive to colonists. Most of its land and people were engaged in food production and it could not generate sufficient exports to support the colonial bureaucracy and the increasing population in Bissau and other towns, nor to promote its peoples’ social welfare.

Peanut exports rose from 5,000 tons in 1910 to 20,000 tons in 1925. Under the Estado Novo exports averaged almost 30,000 tons a year in 1939–45, rising to 35,000 tons between 1946 and 1955, but falling in the next decade because of falling prices. The peanut export trade improved Guinea&#x27;s balance of payments up to the mid-1950s but had little effect on its peoples’ economic or social welfare, as the Estado Novo granted an import and export trade monopoly to a Portuguese conglomerate, Companhia União Fabril.
Until 1942 growers received prices at world levels, but they then declined. Forced labour was rarely used, but Africans were obliged to plant peanuts. However, the Estado Novo lacked sufficient coercive powers to force the peanut production it wanted, if this limited the production of rice for food. The lack of taxable export crops meant that the Portuguese administration remained unable to increase its income or its authority, in a self-limiting cycle.

Low prices for exports and a rapid increase in imports after 1958 led to worsening trade deficits throughout the 1960s. Exports covered 42% of the cost of imports in 1964, but only 20% in 1968. Growing rice for food expanded in the 1950s and 1960s, reducing the land available for cash crops.

Migration of Balanta from northern Guinea to the south to cultivate rice intensified in the 1920s. Balanta rice cultivation greatly increased in the 1930s and 1940s, but the state granted legal title to the pontas to Europeans or Cape Verdeans. These bought rice from the farmers at fixed low prices and exported much of it, so by the 1950s the south of Guinea had a rice shortage.

The decade up to 1973 was dominated by the war. In 1953, some 410,000 hectares were cultivated, but only 250,000 hectares in 1972, and many farmers fled from Guinea or to Bissau and other towns. Reduced food production and the loss of many rice paddies led to widespread malnutrition and disease. An agronomic survey of Guinea by Amílcar Cabral contained a major critique of Estado Novo policies. He was concerned about the emphasis on peanuts, amounting to virtual monoculture, and abandonment of traditional techniques, but he urged state control and collectivisation, not smallholder farming.

<doc id="671926" wikidata="Q359053" url="?curid=671926" title="Percy Schmeiser">
<text>Percy Schmeiser (5 January 193113 October 2020) was a Canadian businessman, farmer, and politician. In 1954, he took over the operations of the family owned farm, gas station, and farm equipment dealership. He renamed the farm equipment dealership Schmeiser&#x27;s Garage and added a second farm equipment dealership in Humboldt, Saskatchewan (Central Farm Sales) in 1986 and oversaw their operations until their sale in 2003.

He became an international symbol and spokesperson for independent farmers&#x27; rights and the regulation of transgenic crops during his protracted legal battle with multinational agrichemical company Monsanto. While farming, he specialized in breeding and growing canola, field peas, mustard, and wheat. He is the subject of the 2009 film &quot;David Versus Monsanto&quot; and the 2020 film &quot;Percy&quot;.

== &quot;Monsanto v. Schmeiser&quot;==

In 1997, Schmeiser found volunteer canola plants and a number of weeds growing along the road in one of his fields. He testified that he sprayed these weeds in what is commonly known as a &quot;spring burn.&quot; This practice eliminates weeds prior to planting of the crop, as weeds take valuable moisture away from the crop during germination. Schmeiser surprisingly found that a number of these volunteer canola plants had survived after the spring burn, potentially meaning they had developed a resistance to chemicals. As it was only the second year that Roundup Ready canola was available for use, this was highly unusual. He testified that his intention all along was to plant canola in that field as it was fallow (not planted the year before), as it was part of his crop rotation to prevent disease. In seeking the potential of the largest return, he typically planted canola in a fallow field. When he then harvested that crop approximately 90 days later, the thought that any other part of his field may be contaminated with Roundup Ready canola was the furthest thing from his mind.

Following farmers&#x27; long standing rights to save and use their own seed, Schmeiser saved all of canola from that and his other fields and kept a small amount aside for planting in 1998. The rest of his canola was sold to a nearby processing plant. Without Schmeiser&#x27;s permission or knowledge, Monsanto trespassed onto his fields and took samples of his canola plants during the first stage of germination. Monsanto then approached him to pay a &quot;technology use fee&quot; for using Monsanto&#x27;s patented technology without a license. Schmeiser refused, stating that there was no intent to use Monsanto&#x27;s product, that he didn&#x27;t spray his fields with Roundup (the only benefit of Roundup Ready canola) and claimed that the actual seed was his because it was grown on his land. After demands and threats, Monsanto sued Schmeiser for patent infringement on August 6, 1998.

For the next several years, the case traveled through the Canadian court system. The initial focus of Monsanto&#x27;s action was that they were seeking $15/acre (1030acres X $15. = $15k) plus costs, as they claimed Schmeiser had Monsanto&#x27;s technology in his possession without paying for it, even though the court found that Schmeiser did not spray any of his canola with Roundup. Monsanto stated that this was immaterial; as he had their technology on his fields. Over time, Monsanto changed their approach that the case was done on principle, not financial; solely that they had a valid patent, and they would use a valid patent to sue other farmers.

Meanwhile, Schmeiser became a popular figure among those opposed to genetic engineering. He accepted speaking engagements around the world. Schmeiser continued to face threats and harassment from Robertson Investigations; a firm hired by Monsanto to enforce their patent. Ultimately, in a split decision from the Supreme Court of Canada, Schmeiser won a 9–0 ruling that he did not have to pay Monsanto their technology-use fee, damages, or costs. The court ruled that Schmeiser did not receive any benefit from Monsanto&#x27;s technology, but still ruled in a 5–4 decision that Monsanto had a valid patent, and that unintentional possession didn&#x27;t matter, thus Schmeiser infringed on the patent.

A film about Schmeiser&#x27;s fight with Monsanto, with Christopher Walken as Schmeiser, was released the week before Schmeiser&#x27;s death on October 13, 2020.

== &quot;Schmeiser v. Monsanto&quot; ==
On August 11, 1999, Schmeiser filed a separate lawsuit against Monsanto for ten million dollars for &quot;libel, trespass, and contamination of his fields with Roundup Ready Canola&quot;. As of 2007, Schmeiser had not started to prosecute that lawsuit.

In 2002 Schmeiser&#x27;s wife, Louise Schmeiser, filed suit against Monsanto for $140 plus costs to remove contamination of her organic garden with volunteer GM canola; the case was dismissed.

Schmeiser again discovered Roundup Ready Canola growing in his fields in 2005, even though canola had not been planted in that particular field since 1998. He contacted Monsanto to have the company remove it, but when Monsanto conditioned doing so on Schmeiser signing a confidentiality agreement and a release from litigation, Schmeiser had the cleanup done and billed Monsanto for the $660 cost. When Monsanto refused to pay, Schmeiser sued in small claims court. On March 19, 2008, Monsanto settled out of court, paying the $660 without stipulation.

== Other accomplishments ==
Schmeiser spent over 40 years in various political roles and community service. He served as mayor of Bruno from 1966 to 1983, and also as member of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan for the Watrous constituency for the Liberal Party of Saskatchewan from 1967 to 1971. Schmeiser was elected again as a town Councillor of Bruno in 2003 and served as the deputy mayor until 2009.

While serving in the provincial legislature from 1967 to 1971, Schmeiser was on the MLA committee that selected Saskatchewan&#x27;s flag.

Schmeiser was the recipient of the Merit Award for Dealer of the Year in 1984 by the Saskatchewan Manitoba Implement Dealers Association. He was appointed to Saskatchewan&#x27;s Real Estate Commission in 1993 and served until 1999. In 2000, he received the Mahatma Gandhi Award for working for the good of society. In 2007, Percy Schmeiser and Louise Schmeiser were named winners of the Right Livelihood Award:

==Death==
Schmeiser died on October 13, 2020, at the age of 89 from Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

<text>Lisa Randall (born June 18, 1962) is an American theoretical physicist and Frank B. Baird, Jr. Professor of Science at Harvard University. Her research includes the fundamental forces of nature and dimensions of space. She studies the Standard Model, supersymmetry, possible solutions to the hierarchy problem concerning the relative weakness of gravity, cosmology of dimensions, baryogenesis, cosmological inflation, and dark matter. She contributed to the Randall–Sundrum model, first published in 1999 with Raman Sundrum.

==Early life and education==
Randall was born in Queens, New York City, New York. She graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1980, where she was a classmate of fellow physicist and science popularizer Brian Greene. She won first place in the 1980 Westinghouse Science Talent Search at the age of 18 and was also named a National Merit Scholar. She attended Harvard University, where she took Math 55, earned a BA in physics in 1983 and a PhD in theoretical particle physics in 1987 under Howard Georgi.

==Academia==
Randall researches particle physics and cosmology at Harvard, where she is a professor of theoretical physics. Her research concerns elementary particles and fundamental forces, and has involved the study of a wide variety of models, the most recent involving dimensions. She has also worked on supersymmetry, Standard Model observables, cosmological inflation, baryogenesis, grand unified theories, and general relativity.

After her graduate work at Harvard, Randall held professorships at MIT and Princeton University before returning to Harvard in 2001. Professor Randall was the first tenured woman in the Princeton physics department and the first tenured female theoretical physicist at Harvard. (Melissa Franklin was the first tenured woman in the Harvard physics department.)

== Writing ==
Randall&#x27;s books &quot;Warped Passages: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Universe&#x27;s Hidden Dimensions&quot; and &quot;Knocking on Heaven’s Door: How Physics and Scientific Thinking Illuminate the Universe and the Modern World&quot; have both been on &quot;New York Times&quot; 100 notable books lists.

Between the hardback and paperback release of &quot;Knocking on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot;, the quest for the discovery of the Higgs boson was actually completed, a subject discussed in the book. Scientists at the Large Hadron Collider found a particle identified as the Higgs boson. She said about the discovery, that even if people don&#x27;t understand everything about it, &quot;what an exciting thing it is that people are excited that there is something fundamentally new that has been discovered.&quot; Randall has an e-book entitled &quot;Higgs Discovery: The Power of Empty Space&quot;. Before the Large Hadron Collider was operating, she wrote an article explaining the discoveries that were expected from using it. She was commonly asked about the misconception that the LHC could make black holes that could destroy the planet. She answered that it was &quot;not even conceivable unless space and gravity are very different from what we thought.&quot;

Randall wrote the libretto of the opera &quot;Hypermusic Prologue: A Projective Opera in Seven Planes&quot; on the invitation of the composer, Hèctor Parra, who was inspired by her book &quot;Warped Passages&quot;.

==Professional organizations==
Randall is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2004) and the National Academy of Sciences (2008), the American Philosophical Society, and a fellow of the American Physical Society.

Randall has helped organize numerous conferences and has been on the editorial board of several major theoretical physics journals.

==Awards and honors==
In autumn 2004, she was the most cited theoretical physicist of the previous five years. Randall was featured in &quot;Seed&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;2005 Year in Science Icons&quot; and in &quot;Newsweek&quot;″s &quot;Who&#x27;s Next in 2006&quot; as &quot;one of the most promising theoretical physicists of her generation&quot;. In 2007, Randall was named one of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 Most Influential People (&quot;Time&quot; 100) under the section for &quot;Scientists &amp; Thinkers&quot;. Randall was given this honor for her work regarding the evidence of a higher dimension.

Other honors:
*J.J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics 2019
*Andrew Gemant Award, 2012
*Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement, 2008
*Lilienfeld Prize, 2007

*Premio Caterina Tomassoni e Felice Pietro Chisesi, from the Sapienza University of Rome, 2003
*National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award, 1992

== Belief in God ==
In an interview she was asked whether she believes in God, she said:
:&quot;... I probably don&#x27;t believe in God. I think it&#x27;s a problem that people are considered immoral if they&#x27;re not religious. That&#x27;s just not true. This might earn me some enemies, but in some ways they may be even more moral. If you do something for a religious reason, you do it because you&#x27;ll be rewarded in an afterlife or in this world. That&#x27;s not quite as good as something you do for purely generous reasons.&quot;

==Personal life==

Randall&#x27;s sister, Dana Randall, is a professor of computer science at Georgia Tech.

Lisa is an avid climber. A rockface along the Mill Creek near Dumont in Colorado, is named Lisa Randall Wall after her by a local climbing society. In a climbing accident, after falling from the cliff despite proper safety measures, she injured her heel.

<doc id="671945" wikidata="Q1692045" url="?curid=671945" title="Johan Ludvig Holstein">
<text>Johan Ludvig Holstein, Lensgreve til Ledreborg (7 September 1694 – 29 January 1763) was a Danish Minister of state from 1735 to 1751. The Danish colony Holsteinsborg on Greenland (now Sisimiut), was named after him.

He was the ancestor of the Holstein-Ledreborg family, including Ludvig Holstein-Ledreborg and Knud Johan Ludvig, Lensgreve Holstein til Ledreborg, husband of Princess Marie Gabriele of Luxembourg.

In 1739 he built Ledreborg Manor near Lejre, Denmark.

== Early life ==
Johan Ludvig was the son of Johan Georg Holstein, who would himself become Danish prime minister, and Ida Frederikke Joachime of the Bülow family. He was born on 7 September 1694, at the Lübz castle which belonged to his maternal grandmother. His tutors during his upbringing included J. W. Schröder who later would go on to tutor Christian VI of Denmark. In 1711 his father sent him to Hamburg where he studied with Johann Albert Fabricius for a year. Subsequently, he studied and traveled at various places in Germany, the Netherlands, France and England until 1716, when he became a courtier and civil servant in Denmark.

== Career in Denmark ==
He obtained the position of marshal of the court to Crown Prince Christian (later King Christian VI) in 1721. In 1727, he became a member of the College of Missions where his father was president, and the same year he also became director of the &quot;Waisenhuset&quot;, an orphanage King Frederick IV founded that year.

When Christian VI became king in 1730, he appointed Holstein &quot;stiftsamtmand&quot; (&quot;amtmann&quot; and co-administrator of the diocese with the bishop) of Zealand and &quot;amtmann&quot; of Copenhagen and Roskilde. In February 1734, he was appointed Minister of Finance. As the new king soon became disappointed in the men he originally had chosen to lead the chanceries, he appointed Holstein leading secretary of the Danish chancery (a position often known as Minister of State) on 12 May 1735, replacing Iver Rosenkrantz. At the same time, he became member of the king&#x27;s council (&quot;Konseillet&quot;). In 1740, he also replaced Rosenkrantz as patron of the University of Copenhagen. In 1757, he additionally became first member of a special agricultural committee which was operative for several years.

Holstein was in regular correspondence with the King about daily affairs and matters with which the King was occupied.

== Religious and scientific interests==
Holstein was deeply religious with pietistic leanings. In his older days he studied Greek in order to be able to read the New Testament in its original language. He also studied philosophy and history. Francis Bacon was among the philosophers he read, and he corresponded with Johann Lorenz von Mosheim and Johann Matthias Gesner. In Denmark, he was in contact with historians Hans Gram and Andreas Hojer.

With the permission of the King, Holstein and Gram founded the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters on 13 November 1742. He served as president of the Academy for the rest of his lifetime and the meetings were held at his residence. The academy opted right from the beginning to publish in Danish rather than German, even though German was Holstein&#x27;s mother tongue as well as the language of many academics in Denmark at that time.

== Personal life and Ledreborg ==

Holstein married Hedevig Vind (1707–1756), a Danish noblewoman, in 1733. They had three children, among them Christian Frederik Holstein. With the help of her inheritance, capital obtained from selling his properties in Mecklenburg, and his income as a civil servant Holstein was able to buy land in the Ledreborg area, where he built the Ledreborg mansion. Ledreborg was first established as a &quot;stamhus&quot; (family seat) and in 1750 converted into a comital trust (Danish: &quot;lensgrevskap&quot;).

At his death Holstein left a library of 20,000 books, as well as a collection of handwritten manuscripts. Both are now in the Royal Library in Copenhagen.

<doc id="671955" wikidata="Q749227" url="?curid=671955" title="Watch My Chops">
<text>Watch My Chops is a French animated series about an intelligent talking dog, Corneil, and his &quot;dog sitter&quot;, Bernie Barges. It starred Keith Wickham, Ben Small, Dian Perry, Dan Russell, Becca Stewart, Laurence Bouvard and more recently Mark Laidman. The series originally aired from 2003 to 2006 for 52 episodes and was revived from 2014 to 2016 for an additional 52 episodes, bringing the total to 104.

The original French title is &quot;Corneil et Bernie&quot;. In the UK, the show is called &quot;Watch My Chops&quot;, named after Corneil&#x27;s catchphrase. In the United States and Australia, the show is titled &quot;Corneil &amp; Bernie&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Corneil is an intelligent dog: not only can he read and write perfect English, but he is much smarter than most people. Since he is so smart, he knows that life does not get any better than being a pampered pet, and so he does anything he can to keep his owners John and Beth from realizing his phenomenal skills. This plan begins to go awry when they hire the pinheaded Bernie Barges to &quot;dog-sit&quot;, and Bernie learns about Corneil&#x27;s secret. Though the two frequently bicker, they form an uneasy friendship, and Corneil finds himself using his brainy powers to bail Bernie out of various scrapes.

Most episodes are driven by Corneil&#x27;s reluctance to let anyone know that he is intelligent and capable of human speech. The only person who does know is dogsitter Bernie, whose Uncle Rico minds John and Beth&#x27;s apartment. Bernie discovered Corneil&#x27;s speaking abilities by accident, and unfortunately he is somewhat lacking in intelligence and mostly devoid of morals. All this puts Corneil in an uncomfortable position, as Bernie often takes it upon himself to be &quot;the voice&quot; of Corneil, capitalising on Corneil&#x27;s reluctance to communicate and ignoring Corneil&#x27;s requests.

In the 2014 retool of the series, Corneil and Bernie start to get into more bizarre adventures such as hunting for a legendary monster, battling a computer virus, or trying to face the apocalypse. Most of the supporting characters are reduced to background roles and a few minor ones get more focus. This revival also features more humans who find out about Corneil&#x27;s secret, and he begins to worry less about being exposed.

==Characters==

===Main===
* Corneil (voiced by Keith Wickham) – A highly intelligent, elitist dog who speaks with a northern English accent. He loves the comfort of his apartment and is able to talk, read, and write, which he tries to keep a secret, not wanting to be treated differently by humans. In the presence of his masters, he acts like a regular dog. It is only when he is alone or in the company of Bernie that he behaves like a human, answering the phone, cooking, solving problems of mathematics or researching the questions of philosophy. He usually either helps Bernie with his problems or bails him out while other times pursuing his own goal with Bernie&#x27;s support. His mannerisms are reminiscent of Mister Peabody from &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends&quot; segment &quot;Peabody&#x27;s Improbable History&quot;.
* Bernie Barges (voiced by Ben Small) – Corneil&#x27;s best friend and primary caretaker. Bernie is innovative and opinionated, but quite dull-witted. While sometimes arrogant and careless, he is good-natured and respects Corneil. He was initially confined to the boring role of dog-sitter, but he soon found a true friend to navigate life with. When Corneil proves reluctant, he can always threaten to reveal Corneil&#x27;s secret. He usually tries to pursue his own self-serving goals, with Corneil either bailing him out or helping him with them. Bernie sometimes acts as the &quot;frontman&quot; for Corneil&#x27;s goals.
* John and Beth (voiced by Dan Russell and Laurence Bouvard) – Corneil&#x27;s snobby, rich owners. John is an auctioneer and Beth is chief editor of a newspaper. They are a couple; modern, dynamic and a little eccentric. They love Corneil as if he were their own son and care deeply for him. They also place a good amount of trust in Bernie, being their preferred dog-sitter for Corneil.
* Uncle Rico (voiced by Dan Russell) – A high school dropout and former boxer. He was forced to retire following a knockout that claimed eight of his teeth. Today, he is a caretaker and deals regularly with his nephew Bernie.

===Supporting and minor===
* Romeo (voiced by Dan Russell) – The captain of the school football team. As his name suggests, Romeo is a great seducer who has a lot of success with girls. Bernie admires Romeo and dreams of being like him. The reciprocal is of course not true, and Romeo does not take Bernie seriously, though can be friendly at times. Romeo hates Corneil, whom he takes for a fool.
* Martha (voiced by Laurence Bouvard) – Another classmate of Bernie&#x27;s. She is intellectual and often skeptical of Bernie&#x27;s claims. Martha takes care of the school newspaper, which has many causes to defend, and its network of informants allows it to be effective.
* Mrs. Martin (voiced by Dian Perry (season 1), Laurence Bouvard (season 2)) – Bernie&#x27;s mean school principal. She wants her school to be great and have a glorious future but these hopes are usually dashed because of Bernie. As a result, she thinks he is quite the troublemaker and often gives him detention. She is also known to punish students for things that they have not done. Principal Martin tutored Uncle Rico so that he could finally get his high school diploma.
* Mrs. Solo (voiced by Dian Perry) – One of Bernie and Corneil&#x27;s mean neighbors in the apartment building. She dislikes them because they are &quot;always getting in her way&quot; and she once hit Corneil with her umbrella and Corneil made Bernie take her to court.
* Karen (voiced by Laurence Bouvard) – One of Bernie&#x27;s classmates. She is pretty and smart and she is often seen reading a book. Despite Karen&#x27;s hatred of Bernie in &quot;Unlucky Break&quot; and &quot;Corneil in Love,&quot; a wallpaper from Millimages states that she will marry Bernie someday.
* Laura Ryan – Another of Bernie&#x27;s classmates.
* Julie (voiced by Laurence Bouvard) – One of Bernie&#x27;s classmates.
* Frank – Romeo’s friend and one of Bernie&#x27;s classmates.

<doc id="671956" wikidata="Q5280163" url="?curid=671956" title="Dirac string">
<text>In physics, a Dirac string is a one-dimensional curve in space, conceived of by the physicist Paul Dirac, stretching between two hypothetical Dirac monopoles with opposite magnetic charges, or from one magnetic monopole out to infinity. The gauge potential cannot be defined on the Dirac string, but it is defined everywhere else. The Dirac string acts as the solenoid in the Aharonov–Bohm effect, and the requirement that the position of the Dirac string should not be observable implies the Dirac quantization rule: the product of a magnetic charge and an electric charge must always be an integer multiple of formula_1. Also, a change of position of a Dirac string corresponds to a gauge transformation. This shows that Dirac strings are not gauge invariant, which is consistent with the fact that they are not observable.

The Dirac string is the only way to incorporate magnetic monopoles into Maxwell&#x27;s equations, since the magnetic flux running along the interior of the string maintains their validity. If Maxwell equations are modified to allow magnetic charges at the fundamental level then the magnetic monopoles are no longer Dirac monopoles, and do not require attached Dirac strings.

==Details==
The quantization forced by the Dirac string can be understood in terms of the cohomology of the fibre bundle representing the gauge fields over the base manifold of space-time. The magnetic charges of a gauge field theory can be understood to be the group generators of the cohomology group formula_2 for the fiber bundle &quot;M&quot;. The cohomology arises from the idea of classifying all possible gauge field strengths formula_3, which are manifestly exact forms, modulo all possible gauge transformations, given that the field strength &quot;F&quot; must be a closed form: formula_4. Here, &quot;A&quot; is the vector potential and &quot;d&quot; represents the gauge-covariant derivative, and &quot;F&quot; the field strength or curvature form on the fiber bundle. Informally, one might say that the Dirac string carries away the &quot;excess curvature&quot; that would otherwise prevent &quot;F&quot; from being a closed form, as one has that formula_4 everywhere except at the location of the monopole.

<text>Landmannalaugar () is a location in Iceland&#x27;s Fjallabak Nature Reserve in the Highlands. It is on the edge of the Laugahraun lava field. This lava field was formed by an eruption in approximately 1477. It is largely known for its natural geothermal hot springs and surrounding landscape.

Landmannalaugar is at the northern end of the Laugavegur hiking trail, and the Iceland Touring Association operates a mountain hut accommodating hikers.

==Activities==

===Hiking===
Landmannalaugar is known for its hiking trails. Some routes include the hike through the Laugahraun lava field to Brennisteinsalda (&quot;Sulphur Wave&quot;), the one-hour hike up Bláhnjúkur (&quot;Blue Peak&quot;), and the four-hour hike to Ljótipollur crater lake (&quot;Ugly Puddle&quot;). Landmannalaugar can also be the starting point of several longer hiking trails, such as the Hellismannaleið route at the base of the Hekla volcano, and the Sprengisandur route for hikers prepared to travel through volcanic desert.

The huts on the Laugavegur and Fimmvörðuháls trails are (from north to south):
* Landmannalaugar 
* Hrafntinnusker 
* Álftavatn
* Hvanngil 
* Emstrur 
* Thórsmörk
* Fimmvörðuháls

===Other activities===
Icelandic horse riding has been available in the area each summer. The horse riding trips visit places such as Jökulgil (Glacier Valley), that can often be difficult to access on foot and are inaccessible by car. Arctic char fishing is a common activity in Landmannalaugar and nearby lakes. Geothermal hot springs are also present in the area and can be publicly used for bathing. Cross-country skiing often takes place in the area during the winter.

=== Parking reservation ===
The Environment Agency has implemented a parking reservation system, beginning in the 2024 season. The system aims to reduce car traffic, as heavy traffic and limited parking has often led to heavy congestion and traffic knots. A limited number of reservations will be available in advance and a reservation will be needed daily between 8 AM and 3 PM during Summer.

<doc id="671962" wikidata="Q216266" url="?curid=671962" title="Alain Robbe-Grillet">
<text>Alain Robbe-Grillet (; 18 August 1922 – 18 February 2008) was a French writer and filmmaker. He was one of the figures most associated with the &quot;Nouveau Roman&quot; () trend of the 1960s, along with Nathalie Sarraute, Michel Butor and Claude Simon. Robbe-Grillet was elected a member of the Académie française on 25 March 2004, succeeding Maurice Rheims at seat No. 32. He married Catherine Robbe-Grillet ( Rstakian).

==Biography==
Alain Robbe-Grillet was born in Brest (Finistère, France) to a family of engineers and scientists. He was trained as an agricultural engineer. During the years 1943 and 1944, he participated in compulsory labor in Nuremberg, where he worked as a machinist. The initial few months were seen by Robbe-Grillet as something of a holiday. In between the very rudimentary training he was given to operate the machinery, he had free time to go to the theatre and the opera.
In 1945, he completed his diploma at the National Institute of Agronomy. Later, his work as an agronomist took him to Martinique, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, and Morocco. In 1960, he was a signatory to the Manifesto of the 121 in support of the Algerian struggle for independence. He died in 2008 in Caen after succumbing to heart problems.

==Work==
Robbe-Grillet&#x27;s first published novel was &quot;The Erasers&quot; (&quot;Les Gommes&quot;), which was issued by Les Éditions de Minuit in 1953. After that, he dedicated himself full-time to his new occupation. His early work was praised by eminent critics, such as Roland Barthes and Maurice Blanchot. Around the time of his second novel, he became a literary advisor for Les Éditions de Minuit and occupied this position from 1955 until 1985. After publishing four novels, in 1961, he worked with Alain Resnais, writing the script for &quot;Last Year at Marienbad&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Année dernière à Marienbad&quot;), and he subsequently wrote and directed his own films.
In 1963, Robbe-Grillet published &quot;For a New Novel&quot; (&quot;Pour un Nouveau Roman&quot;), a collection of previously published theoretical writings concerning the novel. From 1966 to 1968, he was a member of the High Committee for the Defense and Expansion of French (&quot;Haut comité pour la défense et l&#x27;expansion de la langue française&quot;). In addition, Robbe-Grillet also led the Centre for Sociology of Literature (&quot;Centre de sociologie de la littérature&quot;) at the Université Libre de Bruxelles from 1980 to 1988. From 1971 to 1995, Robbe-Grillet was a professor at New York University, lecturing on his own novels.

Although Robbe-Grillet was elected to the Académie française in 2004, in his eighties, he was never formally received by the &quot;Académie&quot; because of disputes regarding the Académie&#x27;s reception procedures. Robbe-Grillet both refused to prepare and submit a welcome speech in advance, preferring to improvise his speech, as well as refusing to purchase and wear the Académie&#x27;s famous green tails (&quot;habit vert&quot;) and sabre, which he considered outdated.

==Style==
His writing style has been described as &quot;realist&quot; or &quot;phenomenological&quot; (in the Husserlian sense) or &quot;a theory of pure surface&quot;. Methodical, geometric, and often repetitive descriptions of objects replace (though often reveal) the psychology and interiority of the character. The reader must slowly piece together the story and the emotional experience of jealousy, for example, in the repetition of descriptions, the attention to odd details, and the breaks in repetitions, a method that resembles the experience of psychoanalysis in which the deeper unconscious meanings are contained in the flow and disruptions of free associations. Timelines and plots are fractured, and the resulting novel resembles the literary equivalent of a cubist painting. Yet his work is ultimately characterized by its ability to mean many things to many different people.

==Novels==
Robbe-Grillet wrote his first novel &quot;A Regicide&quot; (&quot;Un Régicide&quot;) in 1949, but it was rejected by Gallimard, a major French publishing house, and only later published with minor corrections by his lifelong publisher Les Éditions de Minuit in 1978. His second novel, &quot;The Erasers&quot; (&quot;Les Gommes&quot;), superficially resembles a detective novel, but it contains within it a deeper structure based on the tale of Oedipus. The detective is seeking the assassin in a murder that has not yet occurred, only to discover that it is his destiny to become that assassin.

His next and most acclaimed novel is &quot;The Voyeur&quot; (&quot;Le Voyeur&quot;), first published in French in 1955 and translated into English in 1958 by Richard Howard. &quot;The Voyeur&quot; relates the story of Mathias, a traveling watch salesman who returns to the island of his youth with a desperate objective. As with many of his novels, &quot;The Voyeur&quot; revolves around an apparent murder: throughout the novel, Mathias unfolds a newspaper clipping about the details of a young girl&#x27;s murder and the discovery of her body among the seaside rocks. Mathias&#x27; relationship with a dead girl, possibly that hinted at in the story, is obliquely revealed in the course of the novel so that we are never actually sure if Mathias is a killer or simply a person who fantasizes about killing. Importantly, the &quot;actual murder,&quot; if such a thing exists, is absent from the text. The narration contains little dialogue, and an ambiguous timeline of events. Indeed, the novel&#x27;s opening line is indicative of the novel&#x27;s tone: &quot;It was as if no one had heard.&quot; &quot;The Voyeur&quot; was awarded the Prix des Critiques.

Next, he wrote &quot;La Jalousie&quot; in 1957, one of his few novels to be set in a non-urban location, in this instance a banana plantation. In the first year of publication only 746 copies were sold, despite the popularity of &quot;The Voyeur.&quot; Over time, it became a great literary success and was translated into English by Richard Howard. Robbe-Grillet himself argued that the novel was constructed along the lines of an absent third-person narrator. In Robbe-Grillet&#x27;s account of the novel the absent narrator, a jealous husband, silently observes the interactions of his wife (referred to only as &quot;A...&quot;) and a neighbour, Franck. The silent narrator who never names himself (his presence is merely implied, e.g. by the number of place settings at the dinner table or deck chairs on the verandah) is extremely suspicious that A... is having an affair with Franck. Throughout the novel, the absent narrator continually replays his observations and suspicions (that is, created scenarios about A... and Franck) so much so that it becomes impossible to distinguish between &#x27;observed&#x27; moments or &#x27;suspicious&#x27; moments. &#x27;Jalousie&#x27; is also translatable as Persian blinds, the horizontal shutters common in France that are usually made of wood or sometimes metal. Over the course of the novel the main character looks through his blinds repeatedly in different scenes, the &#x27;jalousie&#x27; he looks out to the world that mutates ever so slightly each time.

In 1984 he published what he described as an intentionally traditional autobiography, entitled &quot;Le Miroir qui revient&quot;, translated into English as &quot;Ghosts in the Mirror&quot; by Jo Levy (1988).

==Films==
Robbe-Grillet&#x27;s career as a creator of fiction was not restricted to the writing of novels. For him, creating fiction in the form of films was of equal importance. His film career began when Alain Resnais chose to collaborate with him on his 1961 film &quot;Last Year at Marienbad&quot;. The film was nominated for the 1963 Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay and won the Golden Lion when it came out in 1961. In the credits it was presented as a film equally co-authored by Robbe-Grillet and Resnais.

Robbe-Grillet launched a career as a writer-director of a series of cerebral and often sexually provocative feature films that explored similar themes to those in his literary work (e.g. Voyeurism, The Body as Text, The &#x27;Double&#x27;). He commenced with &quot;L&#x27;Immortelle&quot; (&quot;The Immortal One&quot;) (1962) which won the coveted &quot;Louis Delluc Prize&quot; of 1962. This was followed by his most commercially successful film after &quot;Last Year at Marienbad&quot;: &quot;Trans-Europ-Express&quot; (1966) starring Jean-Louis Trintignant, who worked with Robbe-Grillet on his next four films, his French-Slovak film &quot;L&#x27;homme qui ment/Muž, ktorý luže&quot; (&quot;The Man Who Lies&quot;) (1968), &quot;L&#x27;Eden et après/Eden a potom&quot; (&quot;Eden and After&quot;) (1970), &quot;Glissements progressifs du plaisir&quot; (&quot;Progressive Slidings towards Pleasure&quot;) (1974) and &quot;Le jeu avec le feu&quot; (&quot;Playing with Fire&quot;) (1975). It was almost a decade before the appearance of his next feature film, &quot;La belle captive&quot; (&quot;The Beautiful Captive&quot;) (1983), where Robbe-Grillet enlisted the services of Henri Alekan as cinematographer. Subsequently, more than a decade passed before Robbe-Grillet got behind the lens again, this time filming a mystery thriller on a small Greek island with Fred Ward starring as the confused Frank in &quot;Un bruit qui rend fou&quot; (&quot;A Maddening Noise&quot;, aka: &quot;The Blue Villa&quot;) (1995). Before his death in 2008 Robbe-Grillet was to direct one more film, &quot;Gradiva&quot; (&quot;C&#x27;est Gradiva qui vous appelle&quot;) (2006) which brought once more to the fore his preoccupation with sadism and bondage in his fiction.

===Other works===

In 1975, Robbe-Grillet and René Magritte published a book entitled &quot;La Belle Captive&quot;. The book is referred to as a &quot;roman&quot; (novel) and is illustrated with 77 paintings by Magritte interspersed with discourse written by Robbe-Grillet. The eponymous film &quot;La Belle captive&quot;, written and directed by Robbe-Grillet, was released in 1983.

In 1981, Robbe-Grillet and Yvone Lenard published &quot;Le Rendez-vous (The Meeting)&quot; in the United States as a textbook for intermediary French courses that included an original novel and grammar exercises. As Trinity College professor Sara Kippur explains, &quot;As a language-learning tool, &quot;Le rendez-vous&quot; advanced a systematic approach that introduced students to increasing complex verb tenses and grammatical constructions.&quot; &quot;Le Rendez-vous&quot; was released in the United States a month before &quot;Djinn&quot; was released in France. The text of &quot;Djinn&quot; was identical to that of &quot;Le Rendez-vous&quot; absent the grammar exercise and with the addition of the prologue and epilogue.

<doc id="671967" wikidata="Q2990985" url="?curid=671967" title="Count Nefaria">
<text>Count Luchino Nefaria is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Stan Lee and Don Heck, the character first appeared in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #13 (February 1965). Count Nefaria is a socialite and crime boss who operates an international crime syndicate known as the Maggia.

==Publication history==
Count Nefaria debuted in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #13 (February 1965), created by Stan Lee and Don Heck. He appeared in the 2011 &quot;Moon Knight&quot; series. He appeared in the 2018 &quot;Marvel Action Avengers&quot; series. He appeared in the 2023 &quot;New Mutants Lethal Legion&quot; series.

==Fictional character biography==
Luchino Nefaria is a wealthy Italian aristocrat and traditionalist that also desires greater wealth and power, driving him to join the Maggia criminal organization. The recently formed Avengers superhero team, however, thwart many of his plans and force a direct conflict, so Nefaria lures the Avengers to his castle on the pretense of a charity event, and places the group in suspended animation, using images which threaten to take control of America. After he releases them, the Avengers become suspicious of him after hearing they are wanted and they cannot remember what happened at the castle. They go to the castle, however nearly all of them are paralyzed by Nefaria&#x27;s gas. Meanwhile, the Teen Brigade were captured by Nefaria, and when they tried to contact the Avengers were thrown in a dungeon which would place them into suspended animation if they touched the walls. Captain America gets into the castle without touching the ground, other Avengers, or walls, and freed the Teen Brigade, who gave the antidote to the Avengers. Captain America was also paralyzed, and with his hands and feet attached to ropes he was suspended between floor and ceiling, where Nefaria mocked him, saying he would be a hero for capturing him. However, Iron Man then burst through the wall. Neferia was defeated and deported after an officer heard him confess to being in the Maggia. In retaliation, Nefaria then unsuccessfully attempts to destroy Iron Man, and then suffers yet another defeat when stopped by the mutant X-Men team.

Nefaria reappears several years later and attempts to take control of the United States base NORAD, but is stopped by the X-Men once again. Nefaria attempts to escape in a plane which is attacked by the X-Man Thunderbird. The plane then explodes, killing Thunderbird and injuring Nefaria.

Now virtually destitute and discredited, Nefaria hires the supervillains Living Laser, Power Man and Whirlwind to form the second Lethal Legion. The group rob several banks, and unwittingly finance an experiment Nefaria has created in a bid to become superhuman. Employing the former scientific adviser to Heinrich Zemo, Nefaria devises a means of temporarily amplifying the abilities of the Lethal Legion, and then sends them into combat against the Avengers. The effect, however, is temporary and once defeated their combined abilities are drained by Nefaria who possesses them magnified a hundredfold. After a long and protracted battle, Nefaria is finally defeated.

Nefaria is then kept in isolation and under observation by the Avengers, and it is discovered that the process to empower him makes Nefaria immortal but vulnerable as his body reconfigures itself. Whitney Frost, also known as Madame Masque and the daughter of Nefaria, attempts to find a cure for what is believed to be his deteriorating condition. She hires the Ani-Men to attack Avengers Mansion and free her father. While battling Iron Man, Nefaria&#x27;s life-support system is severed and his weakened form is crushed by a stored Jupiter Landing Vehicle. Nefaria briefly reappears some time later as a corpse reanimated by the Grim Reaper. Grim Reaper directs Nefaria to attack the Avengers, but loses control soon afterwards and Nefaria dies once again.

Nefaria eventually reappears, but in an ionic humanoid form, and constantly requires ionic energy to sustain his existence. He battles Iron Man and later Captain America and Ka-Zar in the Savage Land as he attempts to find sources of energy. Nefaria then plans to detonate an ionic bomb, which will transform millions of people into an ionic state which he can then control, perceiving it as the best way to guarantee that he receives the respect that he feels he deserves. Nefaria gains control of the ionic heroes Wonder Man and Atlas who he intends to use to kill the Avengers, but he is stopped by the combined efforts of the Avengers, fellow superhero team the Thunderbolts and Madame Masque, Masque using a weapon she had developed to disrupt Nefaria&#x27;s own ionic energy. He is next seen as an inmate of The Raft, a prison for supervillains, and escapes when Electro stages a mass breakout.

Following the &quot;Siege&quot; storyline, Madame Masque sought out her father to help the Hood after Loki took back the Norn Stones. The New Avengers capture John King (Hood&#x27;s cousin) and use him to track the Hood and Madame Masque. After a battle with Count Nefaria, they capture the villains and bring all four of them to Maria Hill to place them under arrest.

Nefaria returns in &quot;Moon Knight&quot;, having established himself as the new Kingpin of Los Angeles. He kills Echo in battle, and is later apprehended by the Avengers. Also in L.A., Daken attempts to kill him but fails. Later back in New York, he is summoned by Nightmare to destroy Squirrel Girl in dreams, but is bested at finger-counting, and leaves.

During the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, Count Nefaria appears as a member of the Army of Evil and took part in the attack on Manhattan in retaliation for what happened at Pleasant Hill during &quot;&quot;.

During the &quot;Spider-Geddon&quot; storyline, Count Nefaria is engaging Superior Octopus, who counters his ionic abilities by having his tentacles charged with energy that disrupts ionic fields. Count Nefaria breaks free from the tentacles as Superior Octopus plans to spy on him and threaten his family.

In the &quot;Sins Rising&quot; arc, Nefaria forms a new incarnation of the Lethal Legion with Grey Gargoyle, Living Laser, and Whirlwind in a plot to target the Catalyst.

During the &quot;Gang War&quot; storyline, Count Nefaria arrives at the location where Hammerhead and his men are having a meeting. Having found out what happened to Madame Masque, Count Nefaria states to Hammerhead that he&#x27;ll take the blame for what happened. He also tells Hammerhead that the crime lords will bow to the Maggia once again. At the Seat of Power, Count Nefaria meets with Silvermane where they talk about the upcoming gang war. In a surprising turn of events, a mysterious person takes control of Silvermane and attacks Count Nefaria. When Hammerhead&#x27;s men arrive and confront Madame Masque, they find a defeated Count Nefaria and Silvermane&#x27;s head in Shotgun&#x27;s arms as he throws them to the ground. After getting a status report of the gang wars from Shotgun, Madame Masque tells her father that she has a use for him. In the face-off in Central Park between the Maggia and Beetle, the Sinister Syndicate, Digger, and the gang members recruited by Beetle, Count Nefaria is seen under the same mind-control spell that Madame Masque placed on Shotgun and Silvermane. As the fight in Central Park begins, Count Nefaria and Silvermane are tackled by Digger. Spider-Man and his allies appear and stop Nefaria.

==Powers and abilities==
Count Nefaria has a genius-level intellect. He is a versed scientist, inventor, theoretical physicist, adept strategist and organizational leader with deep ties to the underworld through his own crime family, the Maggia. During his first appearance he easily turned the American public and the world over against the Avengers in their first meeting. It was not until being subjected to a process perfected by one of Baron Heinrich Zemo&#x27;s scientists, Dr. Kenneth Sturdy, that he was granted the combined powers of the villains the Living Laser, Power Man, and Whirlwind, amplified a hundredfold. Count Nefaria gained superhuman attributes in consequence. He has toppled a 40-story building with little effort, withstood a blow from Wonder Man without flinching, and fought an enraged Thor to a standstill with no apparent damage from strikes of his hammer, even stopping it with his bare hand.

Count Nefaria aged until his body evolved, eventually shifting into pure ionic form. This granted him new abilities, such as the creation and manipulation of ionic energy for teleportation, hand and eye blasts, ionic force punches, or controlling other ionic beings via siphoning their energy. Through this he can also convert others into ionic energy beings as well, in a vampiric fashion, turning them into his superpowered thralls. As such, Count Nefaria is effectively immortal and virtually indestructible. He also has the power of flight, when before he could only leap great distances. He&#x27;s also showcased a new power, creating energy constructs to surround his opponents in ionic energy and move them about telekinetically. He has withstood simultaneous attacks by multiple teams of superheroes at once. Although it is possible to deplete Count Nefaria&#x27;s ionic energy in combat by forcing him to expend it faster than his body can replenish it, it would take several weeks to do so.

As a head of the Maggia, Count Nefaria also has access to vast amounts of technology, munitions, and gadgetry developed by his Research and Development department. Much of this, he had a hand in crafting, such as the Electro-disc, Time Transcender Ray, Visio-Projector, Worldwide Electro-scanner, The Dream Master, and the Ionic Bomb. Being of Italian nobility, Count Nefaria has also inherited a vast fortune, which he has used in conjunction with his intellect for the purpose of furthering his revenue and power. To that end he would use it for the hiring of super villains, scientists and expendable workforce in his organization branch for the creation of inventions that were far in the advances of modern science, give himself super powers or broaden the reach of his connections to both the unlawful and political circuit of the world. Being an aristocrat of considerable stature and influence, Nefaria also has claims to diplomatic immunity and as such he cannot be tried outside of his own home country.

<doc id="671978" wikidata="Q912128" url="?curid=671978" title="Triphthong">
<text>In phonetics, a triphthong ( , ) (from Greek , ) is a monosyllabic vowel combination involving a quick but smooth movement of the articulator from one vowel quality to another that passes over a third. While &quot;pure&quot; vowels, or monophthongs, are said to have one target articulator position, diphthongs have two and triphthongs three.

Triphthongs are not to be confused with disyllabic sequences of a diphthong followed by a monophthong, as in German &#x27;fire&#x27;, where the final vowel is longer than those found in triphthongs.

==Examples==
Triphthongs that feature close elements typically analyzed as and in phonology are not listed. For instance, the Polish word &#x27;tallow&#x27; is typically analyzed as - a sequence of a consonant followed by a vowel and another consonant. This is because the palatal approximant is resyllabified in some inflected forms, such as (instr. pl.), and also because occurs word-finally after a consonant just like does (compare &#x27;industry&#x27; with &#x27;Przemyśl&#x27;), which means that both of them behave more like consonants than vowels.

On the other hand, are not treated as phonetic consonants when they arise from vocalization of , or as they do not share almost all of their features with those three.

===First segment is the nucleus===

====Bernese German====
Bernese German has the following triphthongs:
* as in &#x27;boy&#x27;
* as in &#x27;feeling&#x27;
* as in &#x27;school&#x27;

They have arisen due to the vocalization of in the syllable coda; compare the last two with Standard German and , the last one with a schwa not present in the Bernese word.

====Danish====
Danish has the following triphthongs:
* as in &#x27;ferry&#x27;
* as in &#x27;to whirl&#x27;
* as in , a given name
* as in &#x27;sparrow&#x27;

====English====
In British Received Pronunciation, and most other non-rhotic (r-dropping) varieties of English, monosyllabic triphthongs with R are optionally distinguished from sequences with disyllabic realizations:
* as in: &quot;flour&quot; (compare with disyllabic &quot;flower&quot; )
* as in: &quot;hire&quot; (compare with disyllabic &quot;higher&quot; )
* as in: &quot;&quot; (compare with disyllabic &quot;coyer&quot; ), &quot;&quot; (compare with disyllabic &quot;lawyer&quot; )

As and become and respectively before , most instances of and are words with the suffix &quot;-er&quot;, such as &quot;player&quot; and &quot;lower&quot;. Other instances are loanwords, such as &quot;boa&quot;.

 are sometimes transcribed as , or similarly.

===Second segment is the nucleus===
Spanish:
* as in &#x27;ox&#x27;
* as in &#x27;Uruguay&#x27;
* as in &#x27;you [informal plural] change&#x27;
* as in &#x27;that you [informal plural] may change&#x27;

The last two are mostly restricted to European Spanish. In Latin American Spanish (which has no distinct form), the corresponding words are and , with a rising-opening diphthong followed by a nasal stop and initial, rather than final stress. In phonology, are analyzed as a monosyllabic sequence of three vowels: . In , those triphthongs are transcribed : , , ,

<doc id="671979" wikidata="Q20074" url="?curid=671979" title="Enterprise (NX-01)">
<text>&quot;Enterprise&quot; (NX-01) is the fictional spaceship that serves as the primary setting of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;. The ship predates the other Starfleet ships named &quot;Enterprise&quot; and was first seen in the pilot episode &quot;Broken Bow&quot;. Its missions included an initial period of deep space exploration and a mission into the Delphic Expanse following the Xindi attack on Earth; it was also instrumental in the formation of the United Federation of Planets with the Vulcans, Andorians and Tellarites.

Its final regular appearance occurred in &quot;These Are The Voyages...&quot;, where the ship is seen en route to the signing of the Federation charter and the decommissioning of the ship. &quot;Enterprise&quot; has appeared in several non-canon novels, which describe both its actions in the Romulan War and the vessel&#x27;s final fate as a museum ship in orbit of Pluto. A model of an NX class ship was seen on screen in the 2013 film &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;, and it has appeared in the video game &quot;Star Trek: Encounters&quot; and Star Trek: Legacy. There was a negative fan reaction to the design, but television critics were mostly positive, calling the design &quot;a sort of retro-futurism&quot;. Several &quot;Enterprise&quot; toys and models have been released, including versions by Art Asylum, Diamond Select Toys, QMx and Eaglemoss Publications.

==Background==
In the original pitch for &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; by creator Gene Roddenberry, the vessel that the series was set on was called the SS &quot;Yorktown&quot;. The starship was subsequently renamed USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; before the start of the series because of the growing real world fame of the world&#x27;s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, recently launched by the U.S. Navy as the . The name &quot;Enterprise&quot; has been linked with &quot;Star Trek&quot; since.

Following the end of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, which had been used to launch UPN, they were seeking a new &quot;Star Trek&quot; series. The network contacted Rick Berman during the fifth season of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, and informed him that if he didn&#x27;t develop a new &quot;Star Trek&quot; show then they would find someone else who would. Berman had previously been an executive producer on &quot;Voyager&quot;, and other series dating back to &quot;The Next Generation&quot;. Berman contacted Brannon Braga, and the two became the executive producers on the new show. The new series launched after the end of &quot;Voyager&quot;, but was set a century before the events seen in &quot;The Original Series&quot;. The new series was originally called &quot;Enterprise&quot;, without the &quot;Star Trek&quot; prefix. UPN president Dean Valentine said that &quot;Paramount felt it was no longer necessary. &quot;Enterprise&quot; is synonymous with &quot;Star Trek&quot;&quot;. Berman&#x27;s idea was to set it in an earlier time period, with limited technology such as the ship only being able to travel up to warp 5, as he felt that after three series being set in roughly the same time period it would be exciting for the fans.

==Concept and design==

The first season was originally intended to be based around the construction of the ship. However, UPN wanted a more typical ship-based &quot;Star Trek&quot; series and so the ship was presented as almost finished in the pilot episode, &quot;Broken Bow&quot;. Before the start of the series, the ship was referred to as the SS &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

An early design was for a version with a secondary hull, but it appeared to be too similar to the ship seen in &quot;The Original Series&quot;. That throwback styling had been partially inspired by Berman viewing the throwback concept in the 2002 Ford Thunderbird, itself a modern update of the original Thunderbird. Following that concept, the designers took the styling of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; from &quot;The Original Series&quot; and updated it, but ultimately it looked too much like a simple update to the same vessel.

The second design concept was similar to the &quot;Akira&quot;-class starship as seen on television in the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; and &quot;Voyager&quot; era, with the producers initially intending to use that class of vessel for &quot;Enterprise&quot; before Herman Zimmerman convinced them to go with a design with greater inspiration from &quot;The Original Series&quot;. The &quot;Akira&quot; itself had been created by Alex Jaeger for the 1996 film &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot; with influences from &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, the Klingon Bird of Prey and the &quot;Miranda&quot;-class starship originally seen in &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;. A similar design was created for &quot;Star Trek: The Academy Years&quot;, a film proposed by Harve Bennett in 1989. This featured the primary hull of &quot;Enterprise&quot; seen in &quot;The Original Series&quot;, but without a secondary hull.

===Exterior design===

&quot;Enterprise&quot; NX-01 was designed by Doug Drexler, and based on the features of the &quot;Akira&quot;-class. The new class itself was designated as &quot;NX&quot; by the producers, but Drexler referred to it as the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-class due to the naval tradition of naming the class after the first vessel. Drexler had intended for the ship to be similar in design to the &quot;Daedalus&quot;-class starship with a sphere-shaped primary hull, but the producers wanted a flat saucer-shaped hull as it was more immediately recognizable as a &quot;Star Trek&quot; vessel. Drexler deliberately attempted to insert references to &quot;The Original Series&quot; into the ship. One of these was narrow struts leading from the body of the ship to the warp nacelles – however Dan Curry wanted them made bulkier as seen in ships of later series. Drexler included a leading edge at the front of the nacelles, and later described that the original struts would have been around a third more than those.

Drexler also wanted the bussard collectors at the front of the warp nacelles to be orange like &quot;The Original Series&quot;, but this was overruled by producers once more, who wanted them red also like the later series. Drexler thought that this was because Rick Berman wasn&#x27;t fond of bright colors, and so &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; was filmed in greys and dark blues. The rear ends of the nacelles were influenced by &quot;Enterprise&quot; from &quot;The Original Series&quot;, with the spheres that appeared on the 1960s version split in two for the NX-01. Direct elements from &quot;The Original Series&quot; that did make it on to the NX-01 were the impulse engine cones and the lower sensor dome. The most prominent element from the first television &quot;Enterprise&quot; was the deflector dish. For the NX-01, it was vertically compressed placed at the front of the saucer. The process of Drexler getting his designs approved by the producers was later described as &quot;a long hard battle&quot; by production illustrator and creator of &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E, John Eaves.

The exterior model was created in CGI rather than as a physical model, with the production done by Pierre Drolet from Foundation Imaging using LightWave 3D. Two versions were created – a high definition version that was created for use in the television series itself and a lower resolution, which was also referred to as the &quot;approved model&quot;. The low-res model was used for promotional purposes while work was conducted on the television model. The exterior of the ship made its debut in a centerfold spread in the July 14, 2001 edition of &quot;TV Guide&quot; using the approved model. This version looked smaller as the windows on the ship were larger than used on the television version, and the hull had a bronze tint. Regarding this change in coloration, Drexler later said that he didn&#x27;t know when the change was made as both he and Zimmerman approved the prior version.

Following this initial usage, the approved model was only used as a stand-in for the production version in the previews in the fourth season. The drawing of the exterior of &quot;Enterprise&quot; in the captain&#x27;s ready room was created by John Eaves in less than 24 hours alongside four other drawings of earlier incarnations of the name. The shuttlecraft on the show were directly inspired by the Lockheed Martin X-33, with Zimmerman saying that the re-entry vehicles used now will be the same technology used in the time of &quot;Enterprise&quot; because up until then they won&#x27;t have had the technological push that comes from developing the advanced technology seen being introduced for the first time on the show. These were referred to as shuttlepods in the show; &quot;Enterprise&quot; was equipped with two of them.

====Season 5====
Doug Drexler had intended for &quot;Enterprise&quot; to undergo a major refit if a fifth season had been produced, and the series had not been cancelled at the end of the fourth season. This would have seen the addition of a secondary hull, and resulted in the ship taking on an appearance closer to the &quot;Constitution&quot;-class vessels in &quot;The Original Series&quot; and later series. The redesign made its debut in the 2011 edition of the official &quot;Ships of the Line&quot; calendar. It was one of two designs for vessels never seen on screen to appear in that year&#x27;s calendar, with Matt Jefferies&#x27; design for the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; (XCV-330) also appearing.

This refit design of the NX-class made its television debut in the background of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;&#x27;s third season as a decommissioned ship docked at the Starfleet Museum.

===Interior design===

The interior of the vessel was designed by Zimmerman, who visited United States Navy fast-attack submarines such as the USS &quot;Houston&quot; for inspiration. He also kept in mind the heritage of the other ships named &quot;Enterprise&quot; in the history of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. The designs attempted to allow a greater freedom of filming angles than seen in previous &quot;Star Trek&quot; series. The bridge stations were originally designed with both angular and tubular elements, but the tubular elements were dropped as they seemed out of place. John Eaves created the designs for the stations, while Mike and Denise Okuda, Jim Van Over and Anthony Fredrickson created the mechanical and detailed elements. Inspiration was taken from United States Navy ships and the Space Shuttle, such as the inclusion of operations manuals on some of the stations such as communications. Other elements that were added included a switch from the touch screen controls seen in series such as &quot;The Next Generation&quot; to more hands-on dials and buttons as appeared in &quot;The Original Series&quot;. The set also included what was described as &quot;busy boxes&quot; by the crew, which were parts of the consoles that folded out and were filled with wires - so that background actors could look busy during a shot when &quot;Enterprise&quot; was being refitted or when there was battle damage to be seen on screen.

Zimmerman and his team took feedback from the directors of previous &quot;Star Trek&quot; series to make the new space easier to film. Whereas in other series there have been purpose-built sets for briefing rooms, following the feedback this area was built into the bridge itself as the directors had stated that it proved difficult to make several people sitting around a table seem interesting. The transporter design was intended as a reference to &quot;the original series&quot; design that was created by Matt Jefferies, with Zimmerman including certain design elements such as the wall patterns around the transporter itself. The design of the engineering deck was overhauled from previous series with the intention for it to look like the engine room of a nuclear submarine. Zimmerman described it saying, &quot;You&#x27;re going to see a very powerful engine that looks like a very powerful engine.&quot;

==Appearances==
===Deep space exploration===
The ship first appeared in the pilot of &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, &quot;Broken Bow&quot;. The episode showed the maiden voyage of &quot;Enterprise&quot;, with the crew of 84 returning a Klingon named Klang (Tom Lister, Jr.) to his homeworld, Qo&#x27;noS. Following that success, the ship and crew are ordered to begin a deep space exploration mission. At launch, the vessel was limited to a maximum speed of warp 5 and was equipped with an experimental transporter. The ship was launched three weeks ahead of schedule on April 16, 2151, and several of its weapon systems were not yet online but it was equipped with polarized hull plating as a defensive measure. It was not until the following month while in combat with an unknown foe that its spatial torpedoes were calibrated; and the phase cannons were installed in the following September.

The exploration mission was temporarily cancelled in the final episode of the first season, &quot;Shockwave&quot;, following the destruction of a colony after a shuttlepod from &quot;Enterprise&quot; ignited the atmosphere. The ship was recalled to Earth, but after an investigation showed that the Suliban were responsible, the mission resumed. In &quot;Minefield&quot;, &quot;Enterprise&quot; suffered a hull breach from a Romulan mine, but the crew was informed of a nearby repair facility where the breach was repaired in &quot;Dead Stop&quot;. Following the failure of a plasma injector in the warp drive, the ship had to make a detour to the Kreetassan homeworld in &quot;A Night in Sickbay&quot;.

===The Delphic Expanse===
In the episode &quot;The Expanse&quot;, the final episode of the second season, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was recalled once again to Earth following an attack by the Xindi resulting in the deaths of seven million people, mostly in Florida. The ship and crew were given a new mission, to go into the Delphic Expanse and track down the Xindi to prevent the use of a greater weapon that would destroy Earth. Before departure, the ship was equipped with photonic torpedoes, a new command centre and took on board a detachment of Military Assault Command Operations (MACO) soldiers. During the year-long mission in the expanse, the ship and its crew searched for the location of the Xindi superweapon. During this time, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was repeatedly damaged by the spatial anomalies in the area, which appear to be caused by several alien-built moon-sized spheres. The ship suffers a further hull breach and other damage during the events of &quot;Chosen Realm&quot; when the ship and crew are caught up in the Triannon civil war.

While investigating a possible location of the superweapon in &quot;Azati Prime&quot;, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was severely damaged by several Xindi vessels and its warp coil was destroyed. This necessitates the crew stealing a warp coil from an Illyrian vessel in the following episode &quot;Damage&quot; as without it the ship could not travel at warp and intercept the Xindi weapon. Following that acquisition, the ship and crew is approached by a version of &quot;Enterprise&quot; that had been sent 117 years into the past and has become a generational ship attempting not to disrupt the timeline. The crew of the two versions of &quot;Enterprise&quot; work together and enable the present-day &quot;Enterprise&quot; to enter a subspace corridor to allow Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) to meet with the Xindi Council. The whereabouts of the future &quot;Enterprise&quot; are unknown, but there is speculation as to whether it was destroyed or ceased to exist.

After locating the Xindi weapon in &quot;The Council&quot;, the weapon was launched in &quot;Countdown&quot; with &quot;Enterprise&quot; in pursuit. While Captain Archer leads a boarding party onto the weapon in the final episode of third season, &quot;Zero Hour&quot;, &quot;Enterprise&quot; is commanded by T&#x27;Pol (Jolene Blalock) who directs it to a nearby sphere and Commander Tucker modifies the ship&#x27;s deflector dish to use it as a weapon to destroy the sphere. Despite the interference of several Sphere Builders, the modifications destroy the sphere and set off a chain reaction destroying all the other spheres within the Expanse. &quot;Enterprise&quot; rendezvous with Archer&#x27;s away team and it is revealed to the crew that Archer failed to make it off the superweapon before its destruction. The heavily damaged ship is returned to Earth inside a Xindi-Aquatic vessel. Upon arrival, the crew find that the events of the Temporal Cold War have overtaken them and the vessel is sent back in time to an alternative 20th century where Nazi Germany has successfully invaded the United States. After the crew defeat the alien Vosk (Jack Gwaltney) and recover Captain Archer, the ship is returned to its correct time by Temporal Agent Daniels (Matt Winston) in &quot;Storm Front&quot;.

===The Coalition of Planets and the Romulan War===
Following the Xindi mission, &quot;Enterprise&quot; undergoes repairs and upgrades in &quot;Home&quot;. In &quot;Daedalus&quot;, Dr. Emory Erickson (Bill Cobbs), the inventor of the device, performed an upgrade on the transporter. Further upgrades occurred to the plasma injector in the warp drive, allowing &quot;Enterprise&quot; to reach a cruising speed of warp 5.02 and an emergency speed of warp 5.2. While carrying a Tellarite Ambassador to a conference on Babel One, the ship is diverted due to attacks on several nearby vessels. It is discovered to be a Romulan vessel that uses holograms to change its external appearance. The attacks are explained in &quot;The Aenar&quot; as being an attempt by the Romulans to provoke a war between the Andorians and the Tellarites, but instead &quot;Enterprise&quot; is used as the location for peace talks and is also one of a fleet of vessels used to create a sensor grid to track down the Romulan ship. This temporary alliance between the humans, Vulcans, Andorians and Tellarites becomes known as the Coalition of Planets.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; returns to Earth once more and Commander Tucker transfers to the USS &quot;Columbia&quot; in &quot;Affliction&quot;. He is later reinstated as Chief Engineer to &quot;Enterprise&quot; in the following episode, &quot;Divergence&quot;, after the two vessels undergo a dangerous high warp zip line transfer after &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s warp drive is sabotaged by Klingons. A Mirror Universe version of &quot;Enterprise&quot; is seen in the first part of &quot;In a Mirror, Darkly&quot; under the command of Captain Maximilian Forest (Vaughn Armstrong). The ship is destroyed in combat with Tholians shortly after a mutiny by Commander Archer. In &quot;Demons&quot; and &quot;Terra Prime&quot;, &quot;Enterprise&quot; travels back to Earth to resolve a crisis with a terrorist cell called Terra Prime, which seeks to remove all alien influence from Earth.

The Romulan war was not seen on screen, but instead has been described in the non-canon novel &quot;The Romulan War: Beneath the Raptor&#x27;s Wing&quot; by Michael A. Martin, and subsequent follow-up books. The events of the episode &quot;These Are the Voyages...&quot; on board &quot;Enterprise&quot; are set six years after those seen in &quot;Terra Prime&quot; in 2161, but are actually related in the holodeck on board &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D during the events of the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;The Pegasus&quot;. Following the Romulan war, &quot;Enterprise&quot; is diverted en route to Earth where is it due to be present for the signing of the Federation charter. The non-canon Shatnerverse novel &quot;Captain&#x27;s Glory&quot; states that following its decommissioning, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was placed into the orbit of Pluto as a museum piece.

===Other appearances===
&quot;Enterprise&quot; appeared in the video games &quot;Star Trek: Encounters&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Legacy&quot;, both released in 2006. It is the first vessel that the player controls in each storyline, before moving onto the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; seen in &quot;The Original Series&quot; and later depictions. &quot;Enterprise&quot; was seen as a model in a collection depicting the history of flight in Fleet Admiral Alexander Marcus&#x27; (Peter Weller) office in &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot; (2013). It was placed next to other historical vessels such as the &quot;Wright Flyer&quot;, the Space Shuttle and the &quot;NX-Alpha&quot;. An NX-class starship in the style of the planned season 5 refit appeared at the Fleet Museum in the 2023 &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; episode, &quot;The Bounty&quot; although it is unclear if this was meant to be the &quot;Enterprise&quot; or another NX-class starship as the &quot;Enterprise&quot; had been decommissioned prior to undergoing any refit.

==Reception and commentary==
There was a negative fan reaction to the design of &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and criticism of the efforts of Drexler and the other designers. When questioned about this, Geoffrey Mandel stated in an interview, &quot;Having been around then, I also know that Doug Drexler and John Eaves did EXACTLY what the producers asked them to: Rick and Braga had very strong opinions, and knew exactly what they wanted.&quot;

Allan Johnson, while writing for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, said that &quot;Enterprise&quot; looked &quot;sleeker and less cheesy than the original &#x27;Trek&#x27;.&quot; Johnson added that although it contained technology that wasn&#x27;t as advanced as that seen in the earlier &quot;Star Trek&quot; series set in the 24th century, it &quot;still maintains a techno-savvy, post-1960s &#x27;Trek&#x27; flair.&quot; David Kronke in the Los Angeles &quot;Daily News&quot;, said that the sets were &quot;largely gun-metal gray, representing a sort of retro-futurism – sort of what might&#x27;ve happened if &#x27;50s sci-fi design cliches had had today&#x27;s technology to work with&quot; and that the consoles had a &quot;simpler mechanical feel&quot;. In his review of &quot;Broken Bow&quot; for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, David Segal described &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s speed of warp 4 as slower than a Hyundai.

In 2018, Io9/Gizmodo ranked the NX-01 fictional spacecraft design shown in this episode, as the 7th best version of starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. They felt that it both felt familiar as an &quot;Enterprise&quot; design, but also had its own look.

In 2019, SyFy ranked the fictional starship design, the NX-01 &quot;Enterprise&quot; as the 8th best version of the starship in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction universe.

===Models and toy lines===
The initial figure range by Art Asylum each shipped with an &quot;Enterprise&quot; bridge console. They slotted together to form a bridge diorama. The actual &quot;Enterprise&quot; was also released by Art Asylum, and debuted at the 2002 New York Toy Fair. Following the acquisition of Art Asylum by Diamond Select Toys in 2007, the company continued to release &quot;Enterprise&quot; toys. These included both the main television version and a Mirror Universe configuration as seen in &quot;In A Mirror, Darkly&quot;.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; has also been released as part of model lines. These include a 350:1 scale replica of the CGI model by QMx. It features more than 150 LEDs, sound effects and a signed plaque by Doug Drexler. Each QMx model takes 150 hours to make and was limited to a production run of 1,000 units. QMx also produced the models seen in &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;, including the one of &quot;Enterprise&quot;. &quot;Enterprise&quot; has also been released as a model kit by Round 2 Models as part of their Polar Lights line. These include both the version seen in the television series, and the refit design intended for season five.

<text>The USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; (NCC-1701-E), or &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E, to distinguish it from other vessels with the same name, is a fictional starship belonging to the United Federation of Planets, commonly known as the Federation, in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. It appears in the films &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;, where it serves as the primary setting. It also has cameos in &quot;Star Trek: Prodigy&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot;. It is the sixth Federation starship to carry the name &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The ship&#x27;s captain during the 2370s and early 2380s was Jean-Luc Picard. He was transferred to the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E after the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D was destroyed in &quot;The Next Generation&quot; spin-off movie &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot;.

== Origin and design ==
Ronald D. Moore, the co-writer of &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;, has suggested that construction of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E began during the final season of &quot;The Next Generation&quot; (2370), and that the ship was renamed USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, which would become the next flagship of the United Federation of Planets after the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D had been destroyed.

== Depiction ==
The &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E is a &quot;Sovereign&quot; class starship, launched in 2372 from the San Francisco Fleet Yards under the command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard, and most of the key officers from the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D. According to the non-canon novel &quot;Ship of the Line&quot;, the originally planned name for the vessel was USS &quot;Honorius&quot;, and Montgomery Scott was part of the team of engineers that designed the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E.

In the film &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; participates in the Battle of Sector 001, a Borg attack directly on Earth, the capital of the Federation, using a Borg Cube. Picard&#x27;s haunting memories of his former experience as a Borg drone in &quot;The Next Generation&quot; granted him knowledge on a vulnerable spot on the seemingly-indestructible cube, which he passed on to the other participating Federation ships and they subsequently attacked the spot and destroyed the cube. The Borg cube launches a smaller vessel prior to its destruction, which travels back in time in an attempt to stop Zefram Cochrane&#x27;s first contact with the Vulcans, thus preventing the Federation from ever being formed, although the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew are as yet unaware of this plan as they follow the vessel into the temporal vortex it had created to travel through time. The &quot;Enterprise&#x27;s&quot; crew briefly glimpse the result of the creation of this alternate history while following the vessel back through time; the attack is successful and Earth is wholly assimilated by the Borg. 

Once the &quot;Enterprise&quot; arrives over Earth shortly after the Borg vessel, the vessel quickly targets a particular spot on Earth and attacks, but the &quot;Enterprise&quot; manages to destroy it before it does any serious damage. After the attack, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew determine that they have arrived in the year 2063, the year humanity made first contact with the Vulcans, and they also determine that the Borg vessel&#x27;s target was Bozeman, Montana, the launch site of Cochrane&#x27;s first faster-than-light flight. This leads to the crew now realizing that the Borg&#x27;s reason for time-travelling was to stop the first contact event and they decide to covertly assist Cochrane in his preparations in a bid to ensure the flight happens as intended and history remains intact. 

However, the crew are unaware that some of the Borg had teleported to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; before their vessel was destroyed. The Borg proceed to hijack and almost assimilate the entire ship until Captain Picard and Commander Data reclaim it and rescue the crew. After that, the crew witness Cochrane&#x27;s flight and humanity&#x27;s successful first contact, then Commander Geordi La Forge, the ship&#x27;s Chief Engineer, informs Picard that he has found a way to replicate the Borg&#x27;s temporal vortex and return to their own time in the 24th century, which he successfully accomplishes and the film ends as the &quot;Enterprise&quot; travels into the vortex back to the future. 

In &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot;, the crew stops a Son&#x27;a attempt to forcibly relocate the Ba&#x27;ku people from their homeworld. In &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; is heavily damaged while stopping Shinzon from using a weapon of mass destruction to destroy all life on Earth. The ship returns to spacedock to undergo extensive repairs. In the penultimate episode of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, &quot;Võx&quot;, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; is briefly mentioned as having been later commanded by Worf, but is unusable and out-of service for nebulous reasons. By this point, the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E has been replaced by the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-F which falls under Borg control.

The &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E appears in the &quot;Star Trek: Prodigy&quot; season 1 two-part finale &quot;Supernova&quot; as one of the ships that intercepts the USS &quot;Protostar&quot; and falls victim to the Vau N&#x27;Akat living construct weapon.

In the &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; series finale &quot;The New Next Generation,&quot; Starfleet Command sends the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E to stop a interdimensional rift that&#x27;s threatening to destroy the prime universe, but it won&#x27;t arrive in time so the USS &quot;Cerritos&quot; is dispatched to deal with it in the meantime. After the rift is stabilized, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; is one of the ships that tows Starbase 80 to the rift&#x27;s location.

In the novels published by Pocket Books after &quot;Nemesis&quot;, the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E remains under the command of Picard as of 2385 in the 2013 novel miniseries &quot;Star Trek: The Fall&quot;. Data was resurrected in the novels similarly to the comic miniseries &quot;Countdown&quot;, but he decided not to re-enter Starfleet.

A designer&#x27;s blueprints show that the &quot;Enterprise&quot; has new phaser banks and torpedo launchers in &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; that were not present in &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot;. It also shows the warp nacelles have been moved upwards and forward slightly. &quot;Star Trek: Ships of the Line&quot;, written by &quot;Star Trek&quot;″s technical consultant Michael Okuda, states that the &quot;Enterprise&quot; can travel at up to warp 9.995. However, this conflicts with other sources which may or may not be considered canon, in universe. Those sources published in between the time of &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot; and/or &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot;, state a maximum warp speed of 9.95 or 5000 times the speed of light (as narrated in character by Commander William T. Riker, First Officer). An officially licensed supporting source, that had &quot;Star Trek&quot;″s Michael Okuda as a technical consultant to the authors, states the &quot;Enterprise-E&quot; had &quot;a cruising speed of warp 8 and she could comfortably reach warp 9.95&quot;.

== Reception ==
In 2018, Io9/Gizmodo ranked the fictional spacecraft design shown in the films &quot;First Contact&quot;, &quot;Insurrection&quot;, and &quot;Nemesis&quot;, the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E, as the third best version of starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.

In 2019, SyFy ranked the fictional starship design, the NCC-1701-E &quot;Enterprise&quot;, as the third best version of the starship in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction universe.

== Cultural impact ==
In 2014, a building in China was designed to resemble the ship.

<doc id="671985" wikidata="Q955767" url="?curid=671985" title="Mal Waldron">
<text>Malcolm Earl &quot;Mal&quot; Waldron (August 16, 1925 – December 2, 2002) was an American jazz pianist, composer, and arranger. He started playing professionally in New York in 1950, after graduating from college. In the following dozen years or so Waldron led his own bands and played for those led by Charles Mingus, Jackie McLean, John Coltrane, and Eric Dolphy, among others. During Waldron&#x27;s period as house pianist for Prestige Records in the late 1950s, he appeared on dozens of albums and composed for many of them, including writing his most famous song, &quot;Soul Eyes&quot;, for Coltrane. Waldron was often an accompanist for vocalists, and was Billie Holiday&#x27;s regular accompanist from April 1957 until her death in July 1959.

A breakdown caused by a drug overdose in 1963 left Waldron unable to play or remember any music; he regained his skills gradually, while redeveloping his speed of thought. He left the U.S. permanently in the mid-1960s, settled in Europe, and continued touring internationally until his death.

In his 50-year career, Waldron recorded more than 100 albums under his own name and more than 70 for other band leaders. He also wrote for modern ballet, and composed the scores of several feature films. As a pianist, Waldron&#x27;s roots lay chiefly in the hard bop and post-bop genres of the New York club scene of the 1950s, but with time he gravitated more towards free jazz. He is known for his dissonant chord voicings and distinctive later playing style, which featured repetition of notes and motifs.

==Early life==
Mal Waldron was born in New York City on August 16, 1925, to West Indian immigrants. His father was a mechanical engineer who worked on the Long Island Rail Road. The family moved to Jamaica, Queens when Mal was four years old. Waldron&#x27;s parents discouraged his initial interest in jazz, but he was able to maintain it by listening to swing on the radio. Waldron had classical piano lessons from the age of around seven until he was about 16. He then became inspired to play jazz on tenor saxophone when he heard Coleman Hawkins&#x27; 1939 recording of &quot;Body and Soul&quot;, but bought an alto saxophone, unable to afford a tenor. He played alto for local bands that performed for &quot;dances, bar mitzvahs, Spanish weddings&quot;, frequently taking over the pianist&#x27;s role when other musicians took their solos.

In 1943, after high school and having enrolled in college, Waldron was called up by the army, and was based at West Point, in New York. This allowed him to listen to the greats of jazz in clubs on 52nd Street and elsewhere in the city. After two years in the army, he returned as a student to Queens College in New York, where he studied under composer Karol Rathaus and made the final decision to switch from saxophone to piano. This decision was influenced in part by hearing Charlie Parker&#x27;s virtuoso speed on saxophone, and by not having the extroverted personality Waldron thought necessary for that instrument. Not yet a professional musician, he received money through the G.I. Bill and continued to live with his parents. After obtaining a B.A. in music in 1949, Waldron worked for a short time in rhythm and blues bands, including with Big Nick Nicholas.

==Later life and career==

===Early career in New York===
Waldron went on to work with Ike Quebec in New York in 1950 and made his recording debut with the saxophonist in 1952. They played at Café Society Downtown on Mondays for six or seven months, which helped Waldron gain exposure and more work. Waldron worked frequently with Charles Mingus from 1954 to 1956, as part of the latter&#x27;s jazz composers&#x27; workshop. He was pianist on several Mingus recordings, including &quot;Pithecanthropus Erectus&quot;, which was a key development in the movement towards freer collective improvisation in jazz. In 1955, Waldron worked with Lucky Millinder and Lucky Thompson. Waldron formed his own band in 1956, which consisted of Idrees Sulieman (trumpet), Gigi Gryce (alto saxophone), Julian Euell (bass), and Arthur Edgehill (drums). This band recorded Waldron&#x27;s first release as a leader, &quot;Mal-1&quot;, in November of that year. Waldron was Billie Holiday&#x27;s regular accompanist from April 1957 until her death in July 1959, including for the all-star television broadcast &quot;The Sound of Jazz&quot;.

Waldron played on numerous sessions for Prestige Records from 1956 to 1958, as he was the house pianist with the label, a position he acquired after being introduced to Prestige by saxophonist Jackie McLean. Waldron appeared on several McLean-led recordings, and was praised by critic John S. Wilson for these performances as being &quot;a consistently interesting and inventive pianist, who apparently can create fresh and provocative ideas even in the midst of a shrilling bedlam&quot;. Other leaders he worked under at Prestige included Gene Ammons, Kenny Burrell, John Coltrane, and Phil Woods. Waldron often used his own arrangements and compositions for the Prestige sessions, of which his most famous, &quot;Soul Eyes&quot;, written for Coltrane, became a widely recorded jazz standard following its initial appearance on the 1957 album &quot;Interplay for 2 Trumpets and 2 Tenors&quot;. He composed at night at home in St. Albans between all-day recording sessions, and in a car traveling to and from the studio in Hackensack. Waldron estimated that he composed more than 400 pieces of music during his time with Prestige.

After Holiday died, Waldron played with vocalist Abbey Lincoln and her husband, drummer Max Roach. Around this time, Waldron&#x27;s playing on his own recordings became darker, featuring emotional shifts and variations in minor keys. In 1961, Waldron played in Eric Dolphy and Booker Little&#x27;s quintet, a promising combination that ended when Little died that year, aged 23.

In addition to writing for his own band and those led by others, Waldron wrote and arranged for early play-along records that were published by Music Minus One. Some of these recordings on which Waldron played were released under his name. He also wrote scores for modern ballet in the 1950s and started writing film scores in the following decade. His writing for the film &quot;The Cool World&quot; (released in 1964) was described in &quot;The Oxford Companion to Jazz&quot; as one of the first attempts to stress improvisation rather than composition in a jazz-based film score.

===Breakdown and recovery===
In 1963 Waldron had a major breakdown caused by a heroin overdose. He recounted in 1998 that a lot of musicians in the 1950s and 1960s felt that taking drugs was necessary for career progression. The police assumed they were all doing it; according to Waldron: The police would stop the musicians and search us as we came out of the clubs after work. We had to turn our pockets inside out. After a while, the musicians thought ... well, if you have the name you might as well have the game. Eventually, I overdosed. I couldn&#x27;t remember my own name. My hands were trembling, I couldn&#x27;t play the piano. I needed shock treatments and a spinal tap to bring me back. Waldron always felt that he had to return to playing, but this was a slow process. About a year after the overdose, his physical recovery was sufficient to allow him to start relearning his skills, which he did partly by listening to his own records. His recovery as a musician continued for another two years, as his speed of thought was still too slow over that period to allow genuine improvisation: &quot;I worked out my solos in advance and played what I had written out, until gradually all my faculties returned&quot;.

===Career after move to Europe===
From the mid-1960s on, Waldron spent a lot of time in Europe: Paris, Rome, Bologna, and Cologne, before moving permanently to Munich in 1967. Waldron originally moved to France when film director Marcel Carné asked him if he wanted to compose the score for &quot;Three Rooms in Manhattan&quot; in New York or Paris; Waldron&#x27;s 1958 experience touring Europe with Holiday made the decision an easy one. Waldron&#x27;s stated reasons for settling in Europe were his disgust with the &quot;fierce, cutthroat competition, just to get a job&quot; and the fact that black musicians were paid less than their white counterparts in the U.S. The 1965 score for &quot;Three Rooms in Manhattan&quot; was followed by one for the American film &quot;Sweet Love, Bitter&quot; in 1967. Waldron also composed for theater (Amiri Baraka&#x27;s &quot;The Slave&quot; and &quot;Dutchman&quot;), television, and short films. In Europe around this time he played with other expatriates, including Ben Webster and Kenny Clarke.

Waldron&#x27;s 1969 album &quot;Free at Last&quot; was the first release on the ECM label. This recording was an example of Waldron playing, in his words, &quot;rhythmically instead of soloing on chord changes&quot;. Two years later, another Waldron recording session was the first for another label that became firmly established – Enja Records. His 1971 album &quot;The Call&quot; was the first release on the ECM sublabel JAPO; it features Waldron playing an electric piano. In the early 1970s, he collaborated with the German krautrock band Embryo on the albums &quot;Steig Aus!&quot; and &quot;Rocksession&quot;. Waldron also wrote the score for the 1972 French film &quot;George Who?&quot;

Waldron became popular in Japan, first playing there in 1970, after being invited by &quot;Swing Journal&quot; following the success of one of his earlier recordings. From 1975 he made visits to the U.S., mostly playing solo piano from the late 1970s to early 1980s. Other formats included a quartet with Joe Henderson, Herbie Lewis, and Freddie Waits; another quartet with Charlie Rouse, Calvin Hill and Horacee Arnold; a trio with Hill and Arnold; and a duo with Cameron Brown. Waldron performed and recorded extensively throughout Europe and Japan. In the early 1980s he reported that he allotted agents in France, Germany, Italy and Scandinavia a month each per year of his time, but set aside two months for Japan.

During the 1980s and 1990s Waldron worked with Steve Lacy, notably in piano–soprano duets playing their own compositions as well as Thelonious Monk&#x27;s. Duet albums with others were also prominent in Waldron&#x27;s recordings from the early 1980s. This setting was chosen partly for economic reasons, but mainly for artistic ones, Waldron stated: &quot;jazz is like a conversation. [...] So to do this face to face, it is more direct, stronger and more accurate&quot;. A further film score was written for Japanese director Haruki Kadokawa&#x27;s &quot;Tokyo Blues&quot; in 1986.

Waldron moved from Munich to Brussels in the 1990s, stating that, in Belgium, &quot;nobody stands on the corner waiting for the lights to change. In Germany they watch the lights instead of the cars. The lights never killed anybody.&quot; From the mid-1990s, Waldron traveled to the U.S. less frequently, put off by no longer being allowed to smoke in many of the jazz clubs there. Around the same period, Waldron recorded several albums with vocalist Jeanne Lee. Two of his final recordings were duets with saxophonists who tended, as he did, to play in melodic and free forms: David Murray and Archie Shepp. After some years of indifferent health, Waldron, a heavy smoker, was diagnosed with cancer in 2002. He continued to perform until his death on December 2 of that year in a hospital in Brussels, due to complications resulting from the cancer. He was 77, and had played his final concert in Lille two weeks earlier.

==Personal life==
Waldron married twice and had seven children – two with his first wife and five with the second. Billie Holiday was godmother to his first daughter. Waldron&#x27;s first wife, Elaine, occasionally sang on his recordings. His second wife was Japanese, and they owned and let several apartments in Japan. Combining birthday celebrations with a tour, Waldron took both families – ex-wife, wife, seven children and two grandchildren – on his three-week tour of Japan that coincided with his seventieth birthday. Waldron&#x27;s mother died in 1979. He could speak English, French, German, and Japanese.

==Artistry==
When he first played with Mingus, Waldron was a follower of Horace Silver&#x27;s style, which used added chords and passing notes, as well as Bud Powell&#x27;s, which contained many runs. Mingus encouraged him to strip away these things and concentrate on basic and altered harmonies. Before his breakdown, Waldron played in a lyrical way, but after it, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t find that lyricism inside myself any more, so I became a very angular player&quot;, becoming more like Thelonious Monk in playing and composition style.

From the time he moved to Europe, Waldron played mostly in a free style, while being able to play in a more traditional style when the audience or situation required it. He used thick chords in the lower bass register; his emphasis on weight, texture and frequent repetition of a single and simple motif as opposed to linear and melodic improvisation gave a heavy and dark color to his sound. One facet of his playing was, according to &quot;The Penguin Guide to Jazz&quot;, &quot;likened to American minimalism: a slow accretion of almost subliminal harmonic and rhythmic shifts steadily pile up until the music seems ready to overbalance&quot;.

As an accompanist to vocalists Holiday, Lincoln, Lee and others, Waldron was described by critic and musician Alyn Shipton as &quot;one of the most sublime accompanists in jazz&quot;.

Waldron&#x27;s own assessment of his style was that it was partly a reflection of his personality: &quot;It&#x27;s part of my personality to be very economical with what I have and to use it in all variations before I move to the next set of notes&quot;. He acknowledged the influences of Holiday (on his conception of space and playing behind the beat), Mingus (for the importance of individuality), and Roach (on the value of time signatures other than the usual 4/4), as well as pianists Duke Ellington, Monk, Powell and Art Tatum.

==Influence==
Waldron has influenced later generations of pianists. Examples are Matthew Shipp and Stanley Cowell. Another, Ethan Iverson, describes Waldron as one of his biggest influences, and reports having imitated most aspects of the older man&#x27;s style during his own musical development, through listening to Waldron&#x27;s recordings. Waldron contributed more personally to Ran Blake&#x27;s progress: he was Blake&#x27;s teacher for a time, helping him to improve his rhythmic flexibility and idea development.

<doc id="671991" wikidata="Q146953" url="?curid=671991" title="Blue Dog Coalition">
<text>The Blue Dog Coalition, commonly known as the Blue Dogs or Blue Dog Democrats, is a caucus of moderate members from the Democratic Party in the United States House of Representatives. The caucus was founded as a group of conservative Democrats in 1995 in response to defeats in the 1994 elections. Historically, the Blue Dog Coalition has been both fiscally and socially conservative. At its peak in 2009, the Blue Dog Coalition numbered 54 members.

In the late 2010s and early 2020s, the Coalition&#x27;s focus shifted towards ideological centrism and pragmatic, constituency-based politics; however, the Coalition maintained an emphasis on fiscal responsibility. The Blue Dog Coalition remains the most conservative grouping of Democrats in the House.

As of 2025, the caucus has 10 members.

== Electoral results ==
=== House of Representatives ===
== Overview and history ==

The Blue Dog Coalition was formed in 1995 during the 104th Congress to give members from the Democratic Party representing conservative-leaning districts a unified voice after the Democrats&#x27; loss of Congress in the 1994 Republican Revolution. 

The term &quot;Blue Dog Democrat&quot; is credited to Texas Democratic Representative Pete Geren (who later joined the George W. Bush administration). Geren opined that the members had been &quot;choked blue&quot; by &quot;extreme&quot; Democrats on the left. It is related to the political term &quot;Yellow Dog Democrat&quot;, a reference to Southern Democrats said to be &quot;so loyal they would even vote for a yellow dog before they would vote for any Republican&quot;. The term also refers to the &quot;Blue Dog&quot; paintings of Cajun artist George Rodrigue of Lafayette, Louisiana as the original members of the coalition would regularly meet in the offices of Louisiana representatives Billy Tauzin and Jimmy Hayes, both of whom later joined the Republican Party – both also had Rodrigue&#x27;s paintings on their walls. An additional explanation for the term cited by members is &quot;when dogs are not let into the house, they stay outside in the cold and turn blue&quot;, a reference to the Blue Dogs&#x27; belief they had been left out of a party that they believed had shifted to the political left. At one time, first-term Blue Dogs were nicknamed &#x27;Blue Pups&#x27;. Starting in the twenty-first century, the caucus began shifting its ideology and began adopting more socially liberal stances in order to align more closely with mainstream Democratic Party political values.

=== Disputes within the Democratic Party ===
In 2007, 15 Blue Dogs in safe seats rebelled, and refused to contribute party dues to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. An additional 16 Blue Dogs did not pay any money to the DCCC, but were exempt from party-mandated contributions because they were top GOP targets for defeat in 2008. One reason for the party-dues boycott was contained in remarks made by Rep. Lynn Woolsey of California, encouraging leaders of anti-war groups to field primary challenges to any Democrat who did not vote to end the war in Iraq. Woolsey later stated that she was misunderstood, but the Blue Dogs continued the boycott. Donations to party congressional committees are an important source of funding for the party committees, permitting millions of dollars to be funneled back into close races.

=== Role in the passage of the ACA ===
In the summer of 2009, &quot;The Economist&quot; said the following regarding the Blue Dog Coalition: &quot;The debate over health care ... may be the pinnacle of the group&#x27;s power so far.&quot; &quot;The Economist&quot; quoted Charlie Stenholm, a founding Blue Dog, as stating that &quot;This is the first year for the new kennel in which their votes are really going to make a difference&quot;. In July 2009, Blue Dog members who were committee members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee successfully delayed the House vote on the Health Insurance Reform Bill (HR3200) until after the summer recess. It was during this recess that the term &#x27;Obamacare&#x27; was first derisively adopted by Republicans on Capitol Hill. Blue Dog opposition to a potential &quot;public option&quot; within Obamacare, together with the contentious town hall meetings faced by House members during the 2009 summer recess, gave the healthcare bill&#x27;s Republican opponents an opportunity to attack the public option. However, on Nov. 7, 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Affordable Health Care for America Act 220 - 215 - a bill that would &quot;provide health coverage to almost every American&quot; by creating &quot;a public health insurance option to compete with private insurers.&quot; In fact, a majority of the Blue Dogs actually voted for the health care bill, by a 28 to 24 margin.
&quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated that the Blue Dogs, with over 50 members, were the most influential voting bloc in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2010.

=== 2010s decline ===
The Blue Dog Coalition suffered serious losses in the 2010 midterm elections, losing over half of its seats to Republican challengers. Its members, who were roughly one quarter of the Democratic Party&#x27;s caucus in the 111th Congress, accounted for half of the party&#x27;s midterm election losses. Including retirements, Blue Dog numbers in the House were reduced from 59 members in 2009 to 26 members in 2011. Two of the Coalition&#x27;s four leaders (Stephanie Herseth Sandlin and Baron Hill) failed to secure re-election.

The caucus shrank even more in the 2012 House of Representatives elections, decreasing in size from 27 to 14 members. Speculation ensued that the centrist New Democrat Coalition would fill the power vacuum created by the Blue Dog Coalition&#x27;s decline. Opposition to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and climate change legislation are believed to have contributed to the defeat of two conservative Democrats in the 2012 House elections in Pennsylvania by more liberal opponents.

In the 2016 elections, future Blue Dogs accounted for over half of the Democrats&#x27; gains in the House. In 2018, for the first time since 2006, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee partnered with the Blue Dog PAC (the Blue Dog Coalition&#x27;s political organization) to recruit candidates in competitive districts across the country. After the 2018 House of Representatives elections, the caucus grew from 18 members to 24. All incumbents were re-elected and Rep. Kyrsten Sinema was elected to the U.S. Senate from Arizona. The caucus also added 11 new members who defeated Republican incumbents in the 2018 election in districts that had voted for Donald Trump in 2016.

=== 2020s ===
The Democratic Party lost seats in the 2020 and 2022 House of Representatives elections, including the Blue Dog Coalition. As of April 2024, during the 118th Congress, the Coalition had 10 members.

At the start of the 118th Congress in January 2023, six of the 15 members of the Coalition departed following a failed attempt to rename the group to the &quot;Common Sense Coalition&quot;. Freshman representative Don Davis, who was expected to join the Blue Dogs, also chose not to do so. After this split, the group reorganized and began an effort to stabilize, rebuild, and maintain influence on policy proposals in the closely divided 118th Congress. The effort included a recruitment drive which prompted Mary Peltola (AK-AL), Marie Gluesenkamp Pérez (WA-03), and Wiley Nickel (NC-13) to join, bringing the number of members back up to 10. Under the leadership of Peltola, Perez, and Representative Jared Golden, the caucus shifted its focus towards ideological centrism and pragmatic, constituency-based (especially rural and working-class) politics.

== Policy positions ==
The Blue Dog Coalition&#x27;s positions are socially liberal and fiscally conservative. Historically, the grouping adhered to social conservatism. Although its members have evolved on social issues over time, the group has never taken a position on social issues as a caucus. Scholars and journalists positioned the group as centrist to centre-left, and historically centre-right. 

The Blue Dog Coalition is the most conservative grouping of Democrats in the House. It &quot;advocates for fiscal responsibility, a strong national defense and bipartisan consensus rather than conflict with Republicans&quot;. It acts as a check on legislation that its members perceive to be too far to the right or to the left on the political spectrum. In the 2010s, the Blue Dogs became more demographically diverse and less conservative.

The Blue Dog Coalition is often involved in searching for a compromise between liberal and conservative positions, including classically liberal policies. Most of its members represent competitive swing districts, and are thus inclined to appeal to swing voters.

== Membership ==
In the early years of the caucus, the Blue Dogs were viewed by some as the political successors to Southern Democratic groups such as the Boll Weevils or conservative coalition. The Boll Weevils may, in turn, be considered the descendants of the Dixiecrats and the &quot;states&#x27; rights&quot; Democrats of the 1940s through the 1960s, and even the Bourbon Democrats of the late 19th century.

In 2014, there was no mention of social issues in the official Blue Dog materials. By January 2019, McClatchy reported a transformation of the Blue Dogs from a coalition of &#x27;southern white men&#x27; to &#x27;a multi-regional, multicultural group.&#x27; At that time, the coalition included two African-American members, one Vietnamese-American, one Mexican-American, and only five members from Southern states.

As of April 2024, the Coalition included 10 members. At that point, the Coalition&#x27;s membership was smaller than it had ever been since its formation.

=== Co-chairs ===
The co-chairs of the Blue Dog Coalition for the 119th Congress are U.S. representatives Lou Correa, Vicente Gonzalez, and Marie Gluesenkamp Pérez.

<doc id="671992" wikidata="Q845884" url="?curid=671992" title="NBA Defensive Player of the Year">
<text>The NBA Defensive Player of the Year is an annual National Basketball Association (NBA) award given since the 1982–83 NBA season to the best defensive player of the regular season. The winner is selected by a panel of 124 sportswriters and broadcasters throughout the United States and Canada, each of whom casts a vote for first, second and third place selections. Each first-place vote is worth five points, second-place votes are worth three points, and a third-place vote is worth one. The player with the highest point total, regardless of the number of first-place votes, wins the award. Since the 2022–23 NBA season, winners receive the [[Hakeem Olajuwon]] Trophy, named after the two-time defensive player of the year winner.

Dikembe Mutombo, Ben Wallace, and Rudy Gobert have each won the award a record four times. Dwight Howard has won the award three times, and is the only player ever to have won it in three consecutive seasons. Sidney Moncrief, Mark Eaton, Dennis Rodman, Hakeem Olajuwon, Alonzo Mourning and Kawhi Leonard have each won it twice. The most recent award recipient is Rudy Gobert of the Minnesota Timberwolves.

Although five of the first six winners were perimeter players, the award has traditionally been given to big men who rebound and block shots. Only eight perimeter players have been honored: Moncrief, Alvin Robertson, Michael Cooper, Michael Jordan, Gary Payton, Ron Artest, Kawhi Leonard and Marcus Smart. Payton and Smart are the only two point guards to have won. Jordan, Olajuwon, David Robinson, Kevin Garnett and Giannis Antetokounmpo are the only winners to have also won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) during their careers; Jordan, Olajuwon and Antetokounmpo won both awards in the same season. In Olajuwon&#x27;s case, he is the only one to have also won the NBA Finals MVP Award and the NBA championship in the same season. Jordan is the only recipient to have also won the scoring title in the same season, when he also became the only player to win the award while averaging over 30 points per game (35.0). On four occasions, the Defensive Player of the Year recipient was not voted to the NBA All-Defensive First Team in the same year. Robertson in 1986, Mutombo (1995), Tyson Chandler (2012), and Marc Gasol (2013) were instead named to the second team. Whereas the Defensive Player of the Year is voted on by the media, the All-Defensive teams were voted on by NBA coaches prior to 2014.

Effective with the 2023–24 season, when a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the league and its players&#x27; union takes effect, players must appear in at least 65 games to be eligible for most major regular-season awards, including Defensive Player of the Year. To receive credit for a game for purposes of award eligibility, a player must have been credited with at least 20 minutes played. However, two &quot;near misses&quot;, in which the player appeared for 15 to 19 minutes, can be included in the 65-game count. Protections also exist for players who suffer season-ending injuries, who are eligible with 62 credited games, and those affected by what the CBA calls &quot;bad faith circumstances&quot;.

<text>Waxy is an American stoner rock band from the Desert of Southern California (Palm Springs / Palm Desert / Indio), and is part of the Palm Desert Scene. The power trio consists of frontman Robbie Waldman (guitar/vocals), Tyler Ontiveros (drums) and Robert Bowman (bass). Brett Stadler, long time personal friend of Waldman, is the band&#x27;s eccentric co-lyricyst as well as a published poet. WAXY&#x27;s sound is a cross between Black Sabbath and Thin Lizzy with a healthy dose of Tom Waits. Heavy, sexy and sincere best describe the vibe. Some people describe them as Desert Rock...Europeans call it Stoner Rock. 

Following their 2005 self-titled debut, 2007 saw the release of their second effort &quot;Chainsaw Holiday&quot;.

Things really got going with the release of their album Without Any eXplanation whY.&#x27; 

Since then WAXY hooked up with Cobraside for their distribution and have been touring ever since. 

WAXY&#x27;s latest album titles ‘Betting On Forgetting’. </text><links>

<text>Glynis Leanne Nunn-Cearns OAM (née Saunders, formerly Nunn; born 4 December 1960) is a former Australian heptathlete, the first Olympic champion in the event. Born in Toowoomba, Queensland, she began competing in athletics at age 9, when she was a student at Toowoomba South State School.

She starred in several events, and was thus a natural competitor in the pentathlon (which was replaced by the heptathlon in 1981). In 1978, she qualified for the Commonwealth Games, but could not compete because of an injury.

By the time of the 1982 Commonwealth Games held in Brisbane, she had married decathlete Chris Nunn, and that year the couple moved to Adelaide in South Australia where Chris was studying for a physical education degree at the South Australian College of Advanced Education. In the first heptathlon competition at the Games, she upset the English favourite and took the title. At the inaugural World Championships a year later, she was placed 7th.

Because of the 1984 Summer Olympics boycott, Nunn was one of the medal candidates for the Olympic title, too. The competition was incredibly close, with five athletes fighting for the medals. After the competition, there was confusion about who had won, but when the smoke cleared, Nunn had scored 6390 points, five more than runner-up Jackie Joyner-Kersee. In addition to her gold medal, Nunn was also placed fifth in the 100 m hurdles event, and seventh in the long jump.

After the Olympics, Nunn abandoned the heptathlon, and switched to hurdling. She was hampered by many injuries, but won a bronze medal in the high hurdles event at the 1986 Commonwealth Games. She quit sports in 1990.

==Recognition==
In 1985, Nunn received a Medal of the Order of Australia and was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame. She received an Australian Sports Medal in 2000.

<text>Fjord1 MRF formerly called Møre og Romsdal Fylkesbåtar, short form MRF is a regional Norwegian transportation company, part of the Fjord1 Nordvestlandske group. The company headquarters are in Molde.

MRF is Norway&#x27;s largest car ferry company. It employs 900 people, and operates 37 ferries on 27 routes, servicing in total 66 destinations in Møre og Romsdal county. The company also has five passenger boats running in four routes. In a typical year, MRF transports about 4.5 million cars and over 10 million passengers.

The company was established in 1920 by the merger of a number of local boat services, at that point vital communication links at the road network was scarce in the rugged terrain of Møre og Romsdal. The company was from the outset owned by the Møre og Romsdal county administration and was originally called Møre Fylkes Ruteselskap. During the fifties, sixties and seventies, the company grew along with the general post-World War II expansion and improvement in Norwegian infrastructure. The bulk of the MRF fleet still consists of ferries from the period 1960–80. During the late 1990s, the company began expanding into other sectors, notably by acquiring a number of local bus companies, that are now merged to Fjord1 Buss Møre. The company also owns 49% of Kystekspressen.

This process culminated in 2002, by the formation of the Fjord1 Nordvestlandske group, a joint venture with Sogn og Fjordane&#x27;s Fylkesbaatane. This merger did not go down undisputed, as it was decided that the conglomerate headquarters should be located in Florø. It was also unpopular that Sogn og Fjordane fylke received a 59% majority share in Fjord1, thereby effectively seizing control of the company.</text><links>

<doc id="672020" wikidata="Q193369" url="?curid=672020" title="Prague Castle">
<text>Prague Castle (; ) is a castle complex in Prague, Czech Republic serving as the official residence and workplace of the president of the Czech Republic. Built in the 9th century, the castle has long served as the seat of power for kings of Bohemia, Holy Roman emperors, and presidents of Czechoslovakia. As such, the term &quot;Prague Castle&quot; or simply the &quot;Castle&quot; or &quot;the &quot;Hrad&quot;&quot; are often used as metonymy for the president and his staff and advisors. The Bohemian Crown Jewels are kept within a hidden room inside it.

According to the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;, Prague Castle is the largest ancient castle in the world, occupying an area of almost , at about in length and an average of about wide. The castle is among the most visited tourist attractions in Prague, attracting over 1.8 million visitors annually.

==History==

===Přemyslid fort===
The history of the castle began in 870 when its first walled building, the Church of the Virgin Mary, was built. The Basilica of Saint George and the Basilica of St. Vitus were founded under the reign of Vratislaus I, Duke of Bohemia and his son Wenceslaus I in the first half of the 10th century.

The first convent in Bohemia was founded in the castle, next to the church of St. George. A Romanesque palace was erected here during the 12th century.

Several 13th-century Venetian coins found there were studied by the numismatist Zdenka Nemeškalová-Jiroudková.

===Medieval castle===
King Ottokar II of Bohemia improved fortifications and rebuilt the royal palace for the purposes of representation and housing. In the 14th century, under the reign of Charles IV the royal palace was rebuilt in Gothic style and the castle fortifications were strengthened. In place of the rotunda and basilica of St. Vitus, building began of a vast Gothic church, that were completed almost six centuries later.

During the Hussite Wars and the following decades, the castle was not inhabited. In 1485, King Vladislaus II Jagiellon began to rebuild the castle. The massive Vladislav Hall (built by Benedikt Rejt) was added to the Royal Palace. New defence towers were also built on the north side of the castle.

A large fire in 1541 destroyed large parts of the castle. Under the Habsburgs, some new buildings in Renaissance style were added. Ferdinand I built the Belvedere as a summer palace for his wife Anne. Rudolph II used Prague Castle as his main residence. He founded the northern wing of the palace, with the Spanish Hall, where his precious art collections were exhibited.

The Third Defenestration of Prague in 1618 took place at the castle which kick-started the Bohemian Revolt. During the subsequent wars, the castle was damaged and dilapidated. Many works from the collection of Rudolph II were looted by Swedes in 1648 during the Battle of Prague (1648) which was the final act of the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

The last major rebuilding of the castle was carried out by Empress Maria Theresa in the second half of the 18th century. Following the abdication of Ferdinand I, in 1848, and the succession of his nephew, Franz Joseph, to the throne, the former emperor, Ferdinand I, made Prague Castle his home.

===Presidential residence===
In 1918, the castle became the seat of the president of the new Czechoslovak Republic, Tomáš Masaryk. The New Royal Palace and the gardens were renovated by Slovenian architect Jože Plečnik. In this period the St. Vitus Cathedral was finished on 28 September 1929. Renovations continued in 1936 under Plečnik&#x27;s successor Pavel Janák.

On 15 March 1939, shortly after Nazi Germany forced Czech President Emil Hácha (who suffered a heart attack during the negotiations) to hand his nation over to the Germans, Adolf Hitler spent a night in the Prague Castle, &quot;proudly surveying his new possession.&quot; During the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia in World War II, Prague Castle became the headquarters of Reinhard Heydrich, the Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia. According to a popular rumor, he is said to have placed the Bohemian crown on his head; old legends say a usurper who places the crown on his head is doomed to die within a year. Less than a year after assuming power, on 27 May 1942, Heydrich was ambushed during Operation Anthropoid, by British-trained Slovak and Czech resistance soldiers while on his way to the Castle, and died of his wounds, which became infected, a week later. Klaus, his firstborn son, died the next year in a traffic accident, also in line with the legend.

After the liberation of Czechoslovakia and the coup in 1948, the Castle housed the offices of the communist Czechoslovak government. After Czechoslovakia split in 1993 into the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the castle became the seat of the Head of State of the new Czech Republic. Similar to what Masaryk did with Plečnik, president Václav Havel commissioned Bořek Šípek to be the architect of post-communist improvements for Prague Castle, in particular of the facelift of the castle&#x27;s gallery of paintings.

==Architectural styles of Prague Castle==


Prague Castle&#x27;s architecture is a unique blend of styles from different periods, reflecting its long and complex history. The castle buildings represent many of the architectural styles of the last millennium. Prague Castle includes Gothic St. Vitus Cathedral, Romanesque Basilica of St. George, a monastery and several palaces, gardens and defense towers. Most of the castle areas are open to tourists. The castle houses several museums, including the National Gallery collection of Bohemian baroque and mannerist art, exhibition dedicated to Czech history, Toy Museum and the picture gallery of Prague Castle, based on the collection of Rudolph II. The Summer Shakespeare Festival regularly takes place in the courtyard of Burgrave Palace.

The neighborhood around Prague Castle is called Hradčany.

<text>The self-propelled 17-pdr, Valentine, Mk I, Archer was a British tank destroyer of the Second World War based on the Valentine infantry tank chassis fitted with an Ordnance QF 17 pounder gun. Designed and manufactured by Vickers-Armstrongs, 655 were produced between March 1943 and May 1945. It was used in north-west Europe and Italy during the war; post-war, it served with the Egyptian Army. This vehicle was unusual in that its gun faced the rear of the chassis instead of the front.

==Design and development==
The 17 pounder anti-tank gun was very powerful but also very large and heavy and could be moved about the battlefield only by a vehicle, which made the gun more effective in defence than in the attack. A variant of the Churchill tank had been built in 1942 as a self-propelled gun—the &quot;3-inch Gun Carrier&quot;—and the US was expected to be able to provide the 76 mm armed M10 tank destroyer through Lend-lease. Other projects were considered using obsolete tank chassis, including the Valentine for its reliability and low profile and the Crusader for its good power-to-weight ratio. In development were tank designs using the 17-pounder, which led to the Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger tank (and its post-war variant the Avenger SP gun) derived from the Cromwell cruiser tank and the Sherman Firefly conversion of the Sherman tank.

The Valentine chassis was soon chosen, as it was in production but obsolescent for British use and was also one of the few chassis that could accommodate such a large gun. The engine in the Archer had a higher power rating than in the Valentine. Since the Valentine had a small hull and it was not possible to use a turret, the gun was mounted in a simple, low, open-topped armoured box, very much like the early &quot;Panzerjäger&quot; German self-propelled guns in appearance, with the gun facing to the rear, which kept the length of the Archer short. The mounting allowed for 11 degrees of traverse to either side, with elevation from -7.5 to +15 degrees.

On firing, the gun breech recoiled just shy of the driver&#x27;s space, with the driver staying in position, in case the vehicle needed to move quickly. The rear mounting combined with its low silhouette made the Archer an excellent ambush weapon, allowing its crew to fire, then drive away without turning round. The first prototype was completed in 1943, with firing trials carried out in April 1943. Vickers were given orders for 800 vehicles.

==Service==
Production started in mid-1943 and the Archer entered service in October 1944. It was used in North-West Europe and (in 1945) in Italy. By the end of the war, 655 of them had been produced.

Under military doctrines prevalent in Commonwealth armies at the time, vehicles such as the Archer were &quot;self-propelled anti-tank guns&quot; and operated by the Royal Artillery (RA), rather than Royal Armoured Corps (RAC). This was the same for two vehicles of US origin, that were initially conceived as &quot;tank destroyers&quot; though not used as such by the British: the 3 in. Self-Propelled Mount M10 and 17 pdr Self-Propelled Achilles.)

Post-war, the Egyptian Army received 200 ex-British Archers after the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Some were successfully used against Israeli armour in 1956. The Archer served with some units of the Royal Armoured Corps in the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) in the early 1950s.

Jordanian Arab Legion and National Guard were supplied with 36 ex-British Archers in 1952.

<doc id="672034" wikidata="Q4788629" url="?curid=672034" title="Area codes 416, 647, and 437">
<text>Area codes 416, 647, and 437 are telephone area codes in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for the city of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Area code 416 is one of the original North American area codes created by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) in 1947. Area codes 647 and 437 are additional area codes for the same numbering plan area (NPA), forming an overlay numbering plan.

The incumbent local exchange carrier in the numbering plan area is Bell Canada. Almost all Toronto Bell Canada landlines have area code 416, with 647-numbers allocated disproportionately to a growing mobile telephone market and to competitive local exchange carriers, such as cable and voice-over-IP services. Telephone numbers are portable, with few exceptions for specific services such as pocket pagers.

The competitive local exchange carriers in numbering plan area are Rogers Communications, Telus, and some independent companies.

Demand for telephone numbers with area code 416 for mobile, foreign exchange and voice over IP service in the 905-suburbs (Durham, Peel, York and Halton regions) has elevated the local significance of these numbers as their local calling area is a superset of that of a suburban number.

==History==

Toronto&#x27;s original manual telephone exchanges were recognized by an exchange name and a block of four-digit line numbers. The &quot;GRover exchange&quot; at Kingston Road and Main Street in East Toronto became the first Canadian dial exchange in 1924. Montréal got its first dial telephones one year later. The numbers were dialled as two letters and four digits (2L+4N). &quot;Grover 1234&quot; was dialled GR-1234 (or 47-1234). Conversion to seven-digit (2L+5N) format began in 1951, and continued until the introduction of direct distance dialling (DDD) in 1958.

Area code 416 was one of the 86 original North American area codes, assigned by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) for Operator Toll Dialing in 1947. It comprised most of the populous Golden Horseshoe region in southern Ontario, from Colborne to Niagara Falls to Kitchener-Waterloo. It was almost completely surrounded by Ontario&#x27;s other area code, 613. Ontario and Quebec were the only provinces to be assigned multiple area codes at the inception of the continent-wide telephone numbering plan.

Area code 416 has been split twice. The first came in 1953, when the western portion of 416 (including Kitchener) was combined with the southern portion of area code 613 to form area code 519. This left 416 largely co-extensive with the area that is generally reckoned as the core of the Golden Horseshoe. Despite rapid growth in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), this configuration remained for 40 years.

By the late 1980s, however, 416 was close to exhaustion because of the GTA&#x27;s continued growth and Canada&#x27;s inefficient number allocation system. Canada does not use number pooling as a relief measure. All competing carriers are assigned 10,000-number blocks, which correspond roughly to a single prefix, in each rate centre in which it plans to offer service, regardless of its actual subscriber count. Most rate centres do not need nearly that many numbers to serve their customers, but a number cannot be allocated elsewhere once it has been assigned to a carrier and rate centre, resulting in thousands of wasted numbers. The problem was less severe in the Golden Horseshoe than in other areas of Canada since then, as now, numbers tended to be used up fairly quickly because of the area&#x27;s dramatic growth.

The GTA&#x27;s rapid growth in telecommunication services, and the proliferation of cell phones, fax machines, and pagers, demanded more central offices, with another area code for the Golden Horseshoe soon becoming necessary. This resulted in a second split of 416 when, in October 1993, the area code&#x27;s numbering plan area was reduced to its current size, consisting only of the municipalities constituting Metropolitan Toronto (East York, Etobicoke, North York, Toronto, Scarborough, and York). The rest of the former 416 numbering plan area, consisting of the Golden Horseshoe outside Metropolitan Toronto (the Niagara Peninsula, the regional municipalities of Durham, Halton, Hamilton–Wentworth, Peel, and York, and parts of Northumberland County) were assigned area code 905. Although 905 was introduced in 1993, permissive dialing of 416 for the Golden Horseshoe beyond Metropolitan Toronto continued until March 1994.

With the amalgamation of Metropolitan Toronto into the &quot;megacity&quot; of Toronto in 1998, 416 became the only Canadian area code to serve just one rate centre and just one city. Many of Canada&#x27;s larger cities, especially &quot;megacities&quot; that have been created from mergers of previously separate cities, are split between multiple rate centres that have never been amalgamated. Toronto is an exception and has been a single rate centre, which is by far Canada&#x27;s largest, since 1977, with the merger of the historical Agincourt, Don Mills, Islington, New Toronto, Scarborough, West Hill, Weston, and Willowdale exchanges into the Toronto exchange.

The 1993 split had been intended as a long-term solution for Canada&#x27;s largest toll-free calling zone. Within five years, however, 416 was once again close to exhaustion. Toronto&#x27;s size and status as a single rate centre have caused numbers to tend to be used up fairly quickly. Therefore, the number allocation problem was not nearly as serious as in other Canadian cities that are split between multiple rate centres. Splitting Toronto between two area codes, a solution adopted in the United States for cities like New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles, was ruled out because of the area&#x27;s high population density and the lack of a suitable boundary along which to split. Another option was the conversion to an overlay plan for 416. Overlays were a new concept that was somewhat controversial because of the requirement for ten-digit dialling. Bell and other telephone companies pressed for an overlay since they wanted to spare their customers the expense and burden of having to change telephone numbers, which would have required a massive reprogramming of cellular telephones. Also, it would have been extremely difficult to split Toronto since it is a single rate centre. Ultimately, the decision was made to implement an overlay.

On March 5, 2001, 416 was overlaid with area code 647, creating Canada&#x27;s first overlay. The implementation of 647 made ten-digit dialling mandatory in Toronto. Within a decade, both 416 and 647 were close to exhaustion once again. A new overlay area code, 437, started operation on March 25, 2013. That effectively allocates 24 million numbers to a city of 2.5 million people.

Area code 942 is scheduled for addition to the 416/647/437 overlay on April 26, 2025. Area code 387 has been reserved for Toronto&#x27;s future use.

Since the implementation of area code 647, overlays have become the preferred solution for exhaustion relief in Canada, as it does not require renumbering existing subscriber accounts. As of April 28, 2023, only three Canadian area codes (709, 807, and 867) are still single-code areas, without overlay, still allowing seven-digit dialing for local calls.

==Future==
A 2020 exhaust analysis by the NANPA projects exhaustion in 2025 for central office prefixes in the numbering plan area. On April 26, 2025, the CTRC will introduce area code 942 for Toronto.

==Local calling area==
Toronto is the centre of the largest local calling area in Canada, and one of the largest in North America. As of 2013, the following points in area code 905 were a local call to 416 in Toronto: Ajax-Pickering, Aurora, Beeton, Bethesda, Bolton, Brampton, Caledon East, Campbellville, Castlemore, Claremont, Georgetown, Gormley, King City, Markham, Milton, Mississauga (rate centres Clarkson, Cooksville, Malton, Nobleton, Port Credit and Streetsville) Oak Ridges, Oakville, Palgrave, Richmond Hill, Schomberg, Snelgrove, South Pickering, Stouffville, Thornhill, Tottenham, Unionville, Uxbridge, Vaughan (rate centres Kleinburg, Maple and Woodbridge) and Victoria. Caledon in area code 519 is also a local call to Toronto. Many of these suburban areas are long-distance to each other, particularly, but not exclusively, those which are across Toronto from each other (i.e., north versus east versus west of Toronto).

==In popular culture==
In the Greater Toronto Area, the terms &quot;the 416&quot; is also used to describe the area within Toronto proper, and Toronto residents are called &quot;416ers&quot;. The suburbs are referred to as &quot;the 905&quot; or &quot;the 905 belt&quot;, and suburbanites are called &quot;905ers&quot; (in this use the term does not include the more distant parts of area code 905, such as Niagara Falls).

The 647 area code does not carry the same strong geographic associations as it disproportionately contains nomadic services (such as mobile telephones and voice over IP); an incumbent Bell land line is hard-wired to a specific location in area 416, postal code M. Some have paid a premium for a true 416 number as the code gives the appearance of a local, long-established business instead of a new entrant.

On March 17, 1966, &quot;The Munsters&quot; episode &quot;A Visit from Johann&quot; depicted a person-to-person call to a Happy Valley Lodge in the 416 area code. A hamlet of Happy Valley exists in King Township, in 416 at the time, but now in 905 (as part of York Region).

In 1994, food delivery chain Pizza Pizza obtained a Canadian registered trademark on its 416 telephone number, 967–1111, which had featured in distinctive radio advertising jingles since the 1970s.

Toronto rapper Maestro Fresh Wes rendered homage to the area code in his 1998 song &quot;416/905 (TO Party Anthem)&quot;. Rapper Drake has a tattoo of the number on his rib to symbolize Toronto as his birthplace. Drake has also released his fourth studio album, titled &quot;Views&quot;, referring to the 416 and 647 area codes. His album picture is of him sitting on top of the CN Tower in Toronto.

==Central office codes==
All central office codes reside within the rate centre of Toronto. In some cases, 416 prefixes are available to wire centres outside Toronto city limits which serve Toronto subscribers (such as MALTON22 in Mississauga, which serves an airport hotel strip in Toronto).

===Exchange names===
Toronto&#x27;s original manual telephone exchanges used exchange names, each serving a block of four-digit telephone numbers. The &quot;GRover&quot; exchange at Kingston Road and Main Street in East Toronto was the first Canadian dial exchange in 1924. Montréal in Quebec got its first dial telephones one year later. The numbers were dialled with two letters and four digits (2L-4N). For example, &quot;GRover 1234&quot; was dialled &quot;GR1234&quot; (or &quot;471234&quot;). Conversion to seven-digit (2L-5N) format began in 1951, and continued up to the introduction of direct distance dialling (DDD) in 1958.

Toronto numbers that were converted from 2L-4N format, or from manual service, include:
* 416–363, 364, 366, 368 (EMpire 3,4,6,8) were ADelaide, ELgin, PLaza and WAverly in the Adelaide St (Queen West) area west of downtown. These were the first to be lengthened to 2L-5N in 1951–1953.
* 416-861 (UNiversity 1) was TRinity exchange in the Adelaide St (Queen West) area west of downtown (lengthened to 2L-5N in 1955).
* 416–921, 922, 923, 924 (WAlnut 1,2,3,4) were RAndolph, KIngsdale, MIdway and PRincess (lengthened to 2L-5N in 1954) in the Annex.
* 416–691, 694, 699 (OXford 1,4,9) were HOward, GRover, OXford (lengthened to 2L-5N in 1955) in East Toronto. These numbers usually relate to the Beaches and Upper Beaches neighbourhoods or to Crescent Town in East York.
* 416–461, 463, 465, 466 (HOward 1,3,5,6) were RIverdale, GErrard, GLadstone, HArgrave east of downtown (lengthened to 2L-5N in 1957).
* 416–483, 485, 488, 489 (HUdson 3,5,8,9) were MOhawk, MAyfair (lengthened to 2L-5N in 1958) and HUdson, HYland (lengthened to 2L-5N in 1953); these served the Eglinton area, then the northernmost point on the TTC subway (1954).
* 416–782, 783 (RUssell 2,3) were ORchard, REdfern (lengthened to 2L-5N in 1958) in the Willowdale/Weston areas in the north of the city.
* 416–762, 766, 767, 769 (ROger 2,6,7,9) were MUrray, ROdney, LYndhurst, JUnction (lengthened to 2L-5N in 1955) in the Runnymede/Toronto Junction area in the west end.
* 416–531, 532, 533, 534, 535, 536 (LEnnox 1,2,3,4,5,6) were MElrose, LAkeside, KEnwood, OLiver, LLoydbrook, LOmbard in the Dufferin Street area west of downtown (lengthened to 2L-5N in 1956).

Additional named exchanges were created (as 2L-5N) in the late 1950s to accommodate expansion into then-growing suburbs such as Don Mills (GArden), Agincourt (AXminster/CYpress), Islington (BElmont/CEdar), New Toronto (CLifford), Scarborough (AMherst, PLymouth), West Hill (ATlantic), Weston (CHerry, MElrose) and Willowdale (BAldwin/ACademy). Exchange names were phased out in 1961–1966 in favour of plain seven-digit numbers.

<text>Fjord1 AS is a Norwegian transport conglomerate, one of the largest in the Norwegian transport sector. Formed in 2001, company headquarters are in Florø, with the headquarters of the ferry division in Molde. It operates a fleet of environmentally friendly vessels in the Norwegian fjords.

==Formation==
Nordvestlandske was formed in 2001 by the merger of the county council-owned ferry companies Møre og Romsdal Fylkesbåtar and Fylkesbaatane i Sogn og Fjordane, becoming Fjord1 in December 2002. The fact that the merged company headquarters were located in Sogn og Fjordane made the merger unpopular in Møre og Romsdal county. The choice of name, Fjord1, was also not well-accepted among the local population. These strains on public relations, amongst other things, resulted in talks intended to further the merger process breaking down during the winter and spring of 2004.

Fjord1 AS was listed on the main list on the Oslo Stock Exchange on 15 August 2017. In 2021, US investment firm Vision Ridge Partners and Havila Holding, an investment company owned by the Sævik family, privatised the company, with each having 50% ownership.

==Operations==
The company is one of the largest in the Norwegian transport sector. A holding company with numerous subsidiaries, its main assets are the two ferry companies MRF and Fylkesbaatane, which serve the rugged and numerous fjords of Møre og Romsdal and Vestland counties. The company is involved in numerous transport ventures within its two home counties, including a 66% ownership of the bus company Aukra Auto, a 49% ownership of fast ferry company Kystekspressen (operates an express boat route from Kristiansund to Trondheim) and a 49% of Fjord1 Partner, that operates the Bergen Light Rail. It owned four local bus companies, including Fjord1 Buss Møre, Fjord1 Sogn Billag, Hallingdal Billag and Fjord1 Nordfjord-Ottadalen.

In 2005, the company had 75 ships, 394 buses and 147 trucks and transported 24 million passengers. A study by Siemens and the Bellona Foundation in 2016 identified that of Norway&#x27;s 180 ferries on 112 ferry routes, 127 could feasibly be replaced with either fully electric or hybrid ferries. Fjord1 is transitioning to low- and zero-emission technology and introduced two fully electric ferries, and on the E39 Anda to Lote route in 2018. Between 2017 and 2021, Fjord1 put into service 26 new hybrid-battery ferries and converted a further eight vessels to hybrid-battery propulsion, so they had 34 hybrid battery vessels operating on 17 routes, approximately 43 per cent of its ferries. The 2019 Annual Report records 19.9 Million passengers and 9.9 million vehicles carried.

The group also operates in the tourism sector, through Fjord Tours Group (50/50 ownership with Vy-Gruppen) and The Fjords (50/50 ownership with Aurland Ressursutvikling).

<text>Julian Benjamin Pipe (born May 1965) is a British politician who currently serves as the Deputy Mayor of London for Planning, Regeneration and Skills. Pipe was the first directly elected mayor of the London Borough of Hackney between his election in October 2002 and his resignation in the summer of 2016.

He worked as a journalist for The Sunday Telegraph until taking on the full-time position as mayor. The council was short-listed for Council of the Year in 2010 in what was described as a &quot;Meteoric rise&quot;.

Pipe was elected as a Labour party councillor in Stoke Newington in 1996, later representing the King&#x27;s Park Ward.
He was re-elected at the May 2006 mayoral election, the May 2010 mayoral election and subsequently in the May 2014 mayoral election. He was Leader of Hackney Council from June 2001 to October 2002.

On 30 June 2016 Pipe was appointed the Deputy Mayor for Planning, Regeneration and Skills by Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, and resigned on 20 July 2016 as Mayor of Hackney to take up the post. He was succeeded by Philip Glanville who was reelected for a second term in 2018.

Pipe has launched the Skills for Londoners Capital Fund, investing in digital skills, designs and facilities specifically tailored for disabled Londoners and those with special education needs.

<text>Beur (), or alternatively rebeu, is a colloquial term, sometimes considered pejorative, in French to designate European-born people whose parents or grandparents are immigrants from the Maghreb. The equivalent term for a female &quot;beur&quot; is a beurette. However, the term &quot;beurette&quot; is condemned and criticized by several anti-racist organizations because of the xenophobic and degrading connotation that this word has taken on over the decades (in particular because of the fetishization of North African women in France as well as an insult stemming from colonialism: for several years the racial category &quot;beurette&quot; was the most popular in France on porn sites).
The term &quot;rebeu&quot; is neither applicable to females nor does it have a female version.

== Use ==
The word &quot;beur&quot; was coined using verlan for the word &quot;arabe&quot;, which means Arabic or Arab in French. Since the late 1990s, many young people have used the twice-verlanised term &quot;rebeu&quot; as a synonym. This term is now the dominant term used by the younger generations (under 30). The word &quot;beurette&quot;, the female version of &quot;beur&quot;, is created by adding the -ette female suffix in French. In French many slang words are created by simply reversing the word in terms of spelling and then reading it out. Because of French grammar rules, the new word is usually completely different from the result of reversing the word phonetically. The word &quot;beurgeois&quot; is derived from a combination of the words &quot;beur&quot; and &quot;bourgeois&quot;.

The term is mostly used in French-speaking European countries ― France, Belgium, Monaco, Luxembourg and Switzerland ― as well as in the Maghreb. Due to cultural integration between such peoples across Europe, the term is now popular in other parts of Europe with a large Maghrebi community, such as the UK, Spain, the Netherlands and Italy.

Since 1992, the BEUR.FM radio station has broadcast nationwide (106.7 FM in Paris).

<text>In fluid mechanics, a homentropic flow has uniform and constant entropy. It distinguishes itself from an isentropic or particle isentropic flow, where the entropy level of each fluid particle does not change with time, but may vary from particle to particle. This means that a homentropic flow is necessarily isentropic, but an isentropic flow need not be homentropic.

A homentropic and perfect gas is an example of a barotropic fluid where the pressure and density are related byformula_1where formula_2 is a constant. </text><links>

<doc id="672092" wikidata="Q23383" url="?curid=672092" title="Drawbridge">
<text>A drawbridge or draw-bridge is a type of moveable bridge typically at the entrance to a castle or tower surrounded by a moat. In some forms of English, including American English, the word &quot;drawbridge&quot; commonly refers to all types of moveable bridges, such as bascule bridges, vertical-lift bridges and swing bridges, but this article concerns the narrower historical definition where the bridge is used in a defensive structure.

As used in castles or defensive structures, drawbridges provide access across defensive structures when lowered, but can quickly be raised from within to deny entry to an enemy force.

==Castle drawbridges==


Medieval castles were usually defended by a ditch or moat, crossed by a wooden bridge. In early castles, the bridge might be designed to be destroyed or removed in the event of an attack, but drawbridges became very common. A typical arrangement would have the drawbridge immediately outside a gatehouse, consisting of a wooden deck with one edge hinged or pivoting at the gatehouse threshold, so that in the raised position the bridge would be flush against the gate, forming an additional barrier to entry. It would be backed by one or more portcullises and gates. Access to the bridge could be resisted with missiles from machicolations above or arrow slits in flanking towers.

The bridge would be raised or lowered using ropes or chains attached to a windlass in a chamber in the gatehouse above the gate-passage. Only a very light bridge could be raised in this way without any form of counterweight, so some form of bascule arrangement is normally found. The bridge may extend into the gate-passage beyond the pivot point, either over a pit into which the internal portion can swing (providing a further obstacle to attack), or in the form of counterweighted beams that drop into slots in the floor.

The raising chains could themselves be attached to counterweights. In some cases, a portcullis provides the weight, as at Alnwick. By the 14th century, a bascule arrangement was provided by lifting arms (called &quot;gaffs&quot;) above and parallel to the bridge deck whose ends were linked by chains to the lifting part of the bridge. In the raised position, the gaffs would fit into slots in the gatehouse wall (&quot;rainures&quot;) which can often still be seen in places like Herstmonceux Castle. Inside the castle, the gaffs were extended to bear counterweights, or might form the side-timbers of a stout gate which would be against the roof of the gate-passage when the drawbridge was down, but would close against the gate-arch as the bridge was raised.
In France, working drawbridges survive at a number of châteaux, including the Château du Plessis-Bourré. In England, two working drawbridges remain in regular use at Helmingham Hall, which dates from the early sixteenth century.

=== Turning bridge ===
A bridge pivoted on central trunnions is called a &quot;turning bridge&quot;, and may or may not have the raising chains characteristic of a drawbridge. The inner end carried counterweights enabling it to sink into a pit in the gate-passage, and when horizontal the bridge would often be supported by stout pegs inserted through the side walls. This was a clumsy arrangement, and many turning bridges were replaced with more advanced drawbridges.

==Forts==
Drawbridges were also used on forts with Palmerston Forts using them in the form of Guthrie rolling bridges.

==In art==
Drawbridges have appeared in films as part of castle sets. When the drawbridge needs to be functional this may present engineering challenges since the set may not be able to support the weight of the bridge in the conventional manner. One solution is to build the drawbridge from steel and concrete before hiding the structural materials behind wood and plaster.

<doc id="672098" wikidata="Q1756259" url="?curid=672098" title="Metal Circus">
<text>Metal Circus is an EP by American punk rock band Hüsker Dü, released in 1983 by SST Records. As one of their early records, it was largely rooted in the band&#x27;s initial hardcore punk style. However, signs of a new, poppier influence emerge on &quot;Metal Circus&quot;, particularly in the songs sung by Grant Hart (&quot;It&#x27;s Not Funny Anymore&quot; and &quot;Diane&quot;). It also features some of Bob Mould&#x27;s most passionate singing and shows further development in his guitar playing. Harmonic, chorus-type effects applied to Mould&#x27;s guitar are more prominent. The change from the furious hardcore moments of &quot;Land Speed Record&quot; and &quot;Everything Falls Apart&quot; towards increasing melodicism hints at the groundbreaking new approach that was to be seen on the band&#x27;s next release, &quot;Zen Arcade&quot;.

The horrific murder depicted in the anguished &quot;Diane&quot; is based upon the murder of West St. Paul waitress Diane Edwards by Joseph Ture in 1980. The song was covered by Coffin Break in 1989, Irish band Therapy? in 1995, Superdrag in 1998 and Gravenhurst in 2004 .

While only 21 seconds shorter than their debut studio album, &quot;Everything Falls Apart&quot;, and generally viewed as an EP, &quot;Metal Circus&quot; was almost released as a 30-minute album with 12 songs. The outtakes were &quot;Standing by the Sea&quot; (later used on &quot;Zen Arcade&quot;), &quot;Heavy Handed&quot;, &quot;Is Today the Day?&quot;, &quot;You Think I&#x27;m Scared&quot;, and &quot;Won&#x27;t Change&quot; (which later appeared on the compilation &quot;A Diamond Hidden in the Mouth of a Corpse&quot;). In 2017, The Numero Group released the &quot;Savage Young Dü&quot; compilation of early Hüsker Dü material. A bonus edition of the compilation was packaged with a 7&quot; entitled Extra Circus containing the outtakes from the EP&#x27;s sessions.

==Critical reception==

In a 1984 &quot;Trouser Press&quot; review, John Leland said the band &quot;flirts with heavy metal, but also reveal strains of folk and psychedelia. The metal ventures (noisy lead guitars) expand Hüsker Dü&#x27;s sound without getting sludgy or bombastic. On the slower tunes...the guitars drone like a supercharged Dream Syndicate. On the fast tunes they smoke.&quot; 

AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that &quot;Metal Circus&quot; &quot;is the first indication of Hüsker Dü&#x27;s greatness,&quot; adding that &quot;With these five songs, the band shows more invention, skill, and melody than it did over the course of a full album with &quot;Everything Falls Apart&quot;, and both Bob Mould and Grant Hart emerge as significant songwriters.&quot;

<text>The Kaldadalsvegur (, ) is the shortest of the highland tracks traversing the Highlands of Iceland, therefore the nickname &quot;highlands for beginners&quot; . Its name derives from the valley it crosses: &quot;Kaldidalur&quot; means &quot;cold dale/valley&quot;. Sometimes the Kaldadalsvegur is referred to as simply &quot;the Kaldidalur&quot;. 

The route begins a bit to the north of Þingvellir and to the west of the volcano Skjaldbreiður, which really comes up to its name (meaning &quot;broad shield&quot;). The track continues between the glaciers Þórisjökull and Ok and leads up to the north. To the east of Reykholt it comes near the &quot;Reykholtsdalur&quot; to Húsafell. Then it continues up to &quot;Hvammstangi&quot; at the &quot;Miðfjörður&quot;.

Signed as route 550 (formerly F550), the track is 40 kilometers long, and has no unbridged river crossings. (The Kaldadalsvegur is &quot;not&quot; an F road, and a four-wheel-drive vehicle is &quot;not&quot; legally required to traverse it, however many car rental companies forbid the use of their two-wheel-drive vehicles on this interior route.) 

The other well known highland routes are Kjölur and Sprengisandur.

<text>Ola By Rise (born 14 November 1960) is a Norwegian football coach and former player. He played 18 seasons and 346 matches in the Norwegian top division.

==Career==
In his career as an active player, he was the goalkeeper of Rosenborg BK in Trondheim. From 1977 to 1995 he played 346 matches for Rosenborg in the Norwegian top league, which was a national record at the time he retired and until By Rise was surpassed by former teammate Roar Strand. As of January 2013, By Rise ranks 5th in this respect. He was capped 25 times for the Norwegian national team, and was in the Norwegian squad for the 1994 World Cup. He was also a member of the Norwegian team competing at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California.

By Rise was the assistant coach of Rosenborg under the head coaches Trond Sollied (1998), Nils Arne Eggen (1999–2002) and Åge Hareide (2003). When Hareide quit in Rosenborg to become head coach of the Norwegian national team, By Rise became the head coach of Rosenborg in the 2004 season. Going into the 2004 season, Rosenborg had won twelve consecutive league titles. However, despite winning for a 13th consecutive season in 2004, the club had a relatively poor season by its high domestic standards, as it finished level on points and goal difference with Vålerenga, winning the title on goals scored. By Rise was sacked November 2004 by the club and worked for NRK radio station P1 as managing editor from 1 February 2005. On 18 July 2006, he was assigned as the new assistant coach for the Norwegian national team. In April 2014 he signed a contract for the final 4 games to try Danish team Aarhus Gymnastikforening avoid relegation.

He has also had a professional career outside football as a journalist for Adresseavisen, the local newspaper in Trondheim.

<text>Kjölur () is a plateau in the highlands of Iceland, roughly defined as the area between the Langjökull and Hofsjökull glaciers. It lies at an elevation of about 600–700 metres.

== Geography ==
At the northern end of the Kjölur road, near the headwaters of the Blanda river, the hot springs of Hveravellir provide a warm oasis. Not far from Hveravellir, the Kerlingarfjöll, a volcanic mountain range, is situated to the north-east of the Kjölur road.

== History ==

Like Sprengisandur highland road, the area was probably known since the first times of Icelandic settlement and is mentioned in the Icelandic sagas. A track along Langjökull was used as a shortcut between regions during summer. This is today known as &quot;Kjalvegur hinn forni&quot; (Old Kjalvegur) and is still in use for trekking and horse-riding. Piles of stones mark the track through the highland desert. After some people had perished in a snowstorm by the end of the 18th century, the Kjölur road was forgotten for about 100 years. It was rediscovered in the 19th century.

In the 18th century, the Icelandic outlaw Fjalla-Eyvindur used the Hveravellir hot springs as a settlement. One of the hot spots in this area is still used for bathing.

== Transport ==
A gravel road known as Kjalvegur (F35) runs through the centre of the area, connecting the Southern Region and Northwestern Region of the country. A few smaller tracks lead from the main track, making Hveravellir and Kerlingarfjöll accessible by car. Other tracks however, may be used only on foot.

<text>Kerlingarfjöll () is a tall volcanic massive in Iceland situated in the Highlands of Iceland near the Kjölur highland road. It is usually regarded as part of a large tuya fissure system of in the southern portion of the Hofsjökull volcanic system, although is about in diameter itself, and is between 68 and 350 thousand years old predating some of the activity in the rest of the system. The volcanic origin of these mountains is evidenced by tholeiite basalt deposits, the numerous hot springs and rivulets in the area, as well as red volcanic rhyolite stone most marked near the two caldera. Minerals that have emerged from the hot springs also color the ground yellow, red and green.

The area was known formerly for its summer ski resort, but this was dismantled in 2000. Since 2000, Kerlingarfjöll has been operated as a highland resort, offering accommodation and food services to guests in the area.

On March 17 in 2017 it was reported that the Kerlingarfjöll Mountains and geothermal area were being turned into a nature reserve. Although parts of the place already had protection, a whole are to be under the protection of the state of Iceland. There have been thoughts of using the hot springs as a geothermal power plant. The area is popular with hiking and the tourists.

There are various half-day and one-day hiking trails in the area.

<text>Wassail (, ) is a beverage made from hot mulled cider, ale, or wine and spices, drunk traditionally as an integral part of wassailing, an ancient English Christmastide and Yuletide drinking ritual and salutation either involved in door-to-door charity-giving or used to ensure a good harvest the following year.

==Etymology==

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the word &quot;wassail&quot; originated as a borrowing from the Old Norse salutation &quot;ves heill,&quot; corresponding to Old English &quot;hál wes þú&quot; or &quot;wes hál&quot; – literally meaning &#x27;be in good health&#x27; or &#x27;be fortunate&#x27;. It was initially used in the sense of &#x27;hail&#x27; or &#x27;farewell&#x27;, without any drinking connotation. The English interjection &quot;&quot; is a cognate of the etymon of the second part of &quot;wassail&quot;, and was probably influenced by the Old English phrase.

The expression later became part of the drinking formula &quot;&quot;&quot;wassail ... drinkhail&quot; which, the OED suggests, initially arose in England among the Anglo-Danes, and from there spread to the native population, being considered a specifically Anglo Saxon characteristic by the 12th century. The earliest record is of around 1140, in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s telling of the Rowena story, which has &quot;wes heil ... drinc heil&quot; (or, in a variant reading, &quot;was heil&quot;). Later Middle English manuscripts have a variety of spellings, including and .

The second expression, &quot;drinkhail&quot;, may derive either from Old Norse or Old English, again with a variety of spellings including and .

The earliest example of the drinking phrases in a specifically English context comes from a manuscript of 1275, preserving a 12th-century text which has . [That friend said to [the other] friend..., &quot;beloved friend, wassail!&quot;; the other said, &quot;drinkhail!&quot;]

By 1300, the sense had extended from a toast to the drink itself, especially to the spiced ale used in Twelfth-night and Christmas Eve celebrations. By 1598 it was being applied to the custom of drinking healths on those nights. Shakespeare&#x27;s 1603 use of &quot;Keep wassel&quot; in &quot;Hamlet&quot; i. iv. 10 was the first record of the term&#x27;s use in a more general sense of &quot;carousal&quot; or &quot;revelling&quot;.

==Preparation==
Wassail is a hot, mulled punch often associated with Christmastide, often drunk from a wassail bowl. The earliest versions were warmed mead into which roasted crab apples were dropped and burst to create a drink called &#x27;lambswool&#x27; drunk on Lammas day, still known in Shakespeare&#x27;s time. Later, the drink evolved to become a mulled cider made with sugar, cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg, topped with slices of toast as sops and drunk from a large communal bowl. Modern recipes begin with a base of wine, fruit juice or mulled ale, sometimes with brandy or sherry added. Apples or oranges are often added to the mix, and some recipes also call for beaten eggs to be tempered into the drink. Great bowls turned from wood, pottery or tin often had many handles for shared drinking and highly decorated lids; antique examples can still be found in traditional pubs. Hence the first stanza of the traditional carol Gloucestershire Wassail; variations of which were known to have been sung as far back as the 1700s, and possibly earlier:

At Carhampton, near Minehead, the Apple Orchard Wassailing is held on Old Twelfth Night (17 January). The villagers form a circle around the largest apple tree, hang pieces of toast soaked in cider in the branches for the robins, who represent the &#x27;good spirits&#x27; of the tree. A shotgun is fired overhead to scare away evil spirits, and the group sings the following being the (last verse):

===Lamb&#x27;s wool===
&quot;Lamb&#x27;s wool&quot; or &quot;lambswool&quot; is an early variety of wassail, brewed from ale or mead, baked apples, sugar and various spices.

British-Irish antiquarian Charles Vallancey proposed that the term &quot;lambswool&quot; is a corruption of the name of a pagan Irish festival, &quot;Lamas Ubhal&quot;, during which a similar drink was had. Alternatively, the name may derive from the drink&#x27;s similar appearance to the wool of lambs. Ale is occasionally replaced by ginger ale for children, especially around Halloween and New Year.

===Wassailing===


In the cider-producing counties in the South West of England (primarily Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, Dorset, Gloucestershire, and Herefordshire) or South East England (Kent, Sussex, Essex, and Suffolk), as well as Jersey, wassailing refers to a traditional ceremony that involves singing and drinking to the health of trees on Twelfth Night in the hopes that they might better thrive. In the context of Christian Christmas celebrations, wassailing involves pronouncing a blessing on a tree so that it will bear fruit, often through the singing of a hymn. The purpose of wassailing is to awaken the cider apple trees and to scare away evil spirits to ensure a good harvest of fruit in the Autumn. The ceremonies of each wassail vary from village to village but they generally all have the same core elements. In Dartmoor today, the Ashburton and Moorland Mission Community gathers in the barn at Newcombe Farm to sing Wassailing songs and pray for God&#x27;s blessing on the New Year.

A folktale from Somerset reflecting this custom tells of the Apple Tree Man, the spirit of the oldest apple tree in an orchard, and in whom the fertility of the orchard is thought to reside. In the tale a man offers his last mug of mulled cider to the trees in his orchard and is rewarded by the Apple Tree Man who reveals to him the location of buried gold.

===Popular culture===
====Modern music====
British folk rock band Steeleye Span opened their third album &quot;Ten Man Mop, or Mr. Reservoir Butler Rides Again&quot; (1971) with an extended, minor-key version of &quot;Gower Wassail&quot;, Tim Hart singing the traditional verses and the others joining the chorus.

The British rock band Blur released a song titled &quot;The Wassailing Song&quot;, with each member taking a verse. The release was limited to 500 7-inch pressings, given out at a concert in 1992. The version of &quot;The Wassailing Song&quot; performed by Blur was later adapted in a recording by The Grizzly Folk, who have stated that the arrangement bears a close resemblance to the &quot;Gloucestershire Wassail&quot;.

In her song &quot;Oh England My Lionheart&quot;, on the 1978 album &quot;Lionheart&quot;, Kate Bush sings, &quot;Give me one wish, and I&#x27;d be wassailing in the orchard, my English rose.&quot;

The alternative rock band Half Man Half Biscuit from Tranmere, England, included a song named &quot;Uffington Wassail&quot; on their 2000 album &quot;Trouble over Bridgwater&quot;. With its references to the Israeli Eurovision contestant Dana International, the Sealed Knot English Civil War re-enactment society, and also to the skier Vreni Schneider, the meaning of the song&#x27;s title in this context is a little obscure.

In 2013 Folk Rock musician Wojtek Godzisz created an arrangement of the traditional Gloucestershire Wassail words with original music for the Pentacle Drummers&#x27; first Annual Wassail festival (2013), called &quot;Wassail&quot;.

For the Pentacle Drummers&#x27; second Wassail festival (2014), the pagan rock band Roxircle also wrote a Wassail song especially for the event called &quot;Wassail (Give Thanks to the Earth)&quot;. The Pentacle Drummers encourage their headline acts to write a song centered around wassailing, a way to keep the tradition alive.

The English progressive rock band Big Big Train released an EP entitled &quot;Wassail&quot; in 2015, named for the title track.

Yorkshire-based folk singer Kate Rusby included the track &quot;Cornish Wassail&quot; on her 2015 album, &quot;The Frost Is All Over&quot;.

====Television====
Wassail was mentioned in the television show &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;. Crow T. Robot and Tom Servo ask Mike Nelson to provide some. When asked to explain further what exactly wassail is, they admit to having no idea. However, they offer a guess that it might be an &quot;anti-inflammatory&quot;. Upon actually getting some, they describe it as &quot;skunky&quot;, discovering it to be a 500-year-old batch.

It was mentioned and explained to Bing Crosby by Frank Sinatra in a special episode of the &quot;Frank Sinatra Show&quot; entitled &quot;Happy Holidays with Bing and Frank&quot; released 20 December 1957.

In 2004, the alternative Christmas message was presented by &quot;The Simpsons&quot; who close out with a cup of &quot;traditional British wassail&quot;. When the director cuts, they spit it out in disgust, with Bart remarking that it tasted &quot;like hurl&quot;.

Wassail was featured on the BBC Two special &quot;Oz and Hugh Drink to Christmas&quot;, aired in December 2009. Oz Clarke and Hugh Dennis sampled the drink and the wassailing party in Southwest England as part of their challenge to find Britain&#x27;s best Christmas drinks.

During the episode &quot;We Two Kings&quot; on the NBC sitcom &quot;Frasier&quot;, the title character&#x27;s brother Niles asks to borrow his wassail bowl; when Frasier&#x27;s father Martin asks why they can&#x27;t just use a punch bowl, Niles retorts, &quot;Then it wouldn&#x27;t be Wassail then would it?&quot; In response, Martin looks up &#x27;wassail&#x27; in the dictionary, defined as &#x27;a Christmas punch&#x27;.

In the &quot;Good Eats&quot; holiday special episode &quot;The Night Before Good Eats&quot;, Alton Brown is given a wassail recipe by Saint Nicholas which he then must make to appease a mob of angry carolers.

In Will Vinton&#x27;s Claymation Christmas Celebration, which originally aired December 21, 1987, the main characters of the special Rex and Herb talk about the term &quot;wassail&quot; regarding a specific Christmas carol, which is comically mis-sung by varying groups that show up throughout the show.

<text>Haukadalur (Icelandic: , from , &quot;hawk dale&quot; or &quot;valley of hawks&quot;) is a valley with geothermal activity in Iceland. 

== Geography ==
The shallow valley is at about above sea level about to the north-west of Reykjavík. It lies to the north of Laugarvatn lake in the south of Iceland.

==Geology==
There is a north-south orientated geothermal area in the valley, of about in width and about long, mainly on the eastern slopes of the rhyolite dome of Laugarfjau that is high. To the west of the valley is Bjarnarfell at which is a hyaloclastite ridge mainly composed of basalt and some rhyolite. To the north is a shield volcano, Sandfell at , which on the valley&#x27;s horizon. The volcanoes have not been active for over 10,000 years.

== Geysers ==
Haukadalur is home to some of the best known sights in Iceland: the geysers and other geothermal features which have developed on the Laugarfjall rhyolitic dome. The biggest geysers of Haukadalur are Strokkur and Geysir itself, which gave us the word &#x27;geyser&#x27;. &quot;Strokkur&quot; is very dependable and erupts every 4 to 10 minutes, whereas the bigger &quot;Geysir&quot; nowadays erupts very rarely. There are also more than 40 other smaller hot springs, mud pots and fumaroles nearby. The water source for the geothermal activity may originate from the southern Langjökull ice sheet, about to the north. 

Haukadalur geothermal area was mentioned in written sources around 1294 CE, when new local hot springs were activated by earthquakes, but geothermal activity was present before this. Earthquakes are also known to have activated local geysers in the recent past, including the earthquakes that occurred on 17 and 21 July 2000. Due to the geysers the valley has been a popular tourist attraction since the 18th century.

==Nearby attractions==
The Gullfoss waterfall is about to the north in the direction of the Highlands of Iceland, via the beginning of the Kjölur highland road. Along with Gullfoss and Þingvellir, Haukadalur is part of the Golden Circle.

<text>The Škoda Works (, ) was one of the largest European industrial conglomerates of the 20th century. In 1859, Czech engineer Emil Škoda bought a foundry and machine factory in Plzeň, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary that had been established ten years previously, founding Škoda Works. By World War I, Škoda Works had become the largest arms manufacturer in Austria-Hungary, supplying the Austro-Hungarian army with mountain guns, mortars and machine guns, including the Škoda M1909, and the ships of the Austro-Hungarian navy with heavy guns. After the war and the creation of the First Czechoslovak Republic, the company, previously focusing on the manufacturing of armaments, diversified and became a major manufacturer of locomotives, aircraft, ships, machine tools, steam turbines, equipment for power utilities, among other industrial products.

The deteriorating political situation in Europe by the latter half of the interwar period eventually led to a renewed focus on armaments. Following Nazi Germany&#x27;s 1938 occupation of Czechoslovakia, Škoda&#x27;s factories started supplying the German army with Panzer 35(t) tanks and Jagdpanzer 38 tank destroyers, both based on earlier designs for the Czechoslovak Army. After World War II, Škoda Works was nationalized and split into several companies by the new communist government. Important products during the Communist era included nuclear reactors and trolley buses.

By the early 1990s, with the Communist Party no longer in power, the companies that were part of the Škoda group were privatized and eventually sold off to a number of international buyers such as German conglomerate Volkswagen and South Korean Doosan. Škoda Works is the predecessor of several modern-day companies, most notably car maker Škoda Auto, power station equipment manufacturer Doosan Škoda Power, as well as tram and train manufacturer Škoda Transportation.

==History==

===1859–1899: establishment===

In 1859, Count Ernst von Waldstein-Wartenberg of the aristocratic Waldstein and Wartenberg families set up a branch of his foundry and engineering works in Plzeň. The output of the plant, employing over 100 workers, included machinery and equipment for sugar mills, breweries, mines, steam engines, boilers, iron bridge structures, and railway facilities. In 1869, the plant was bought by engineer and entrepreneur Emil Škoda. Škoda soon expanded the firm, and in the 1880s, he founded what was then a very modern steelworks capable of delivering castings weighing dozens of tons. Steel castings and later forgings for larger passenger liners and warships went on to rank alongside the sugar mills as the top export branches of the factory.

===1899–1945: before and during World War II===


In 1899, the ever-expanding business was transformed into a joint-stock company, and before World War I, Škoda Works had become the largest arms manufacturer in Austria-Hungary. It was a navy and army contractor, mainly supplying heavy guns and ammunition.

Exports included castings, such as part of the piping for the Niagara Falls power plant and for the Suez Canal sluices as well as machinery for sugar mills in Turkey, breweries throughout Europe, and guns for the Far East and South America.

World War I brought a drop in the output of peacetime products. Huge sums were invested into expanding production capacities. By then, Škoda Works held majorities in a number of companies in the Czech lands and abroad that were not involved in arms manufacture. In 1917, the company had 35,000 employees in Plzeň alone.

Following the emergence of the Czechoslovak Republic in 1918, the complex economic conditions of postwar Europe caused the company to be transformed from what was exclusively an arms manufacturer into a multi-sector concern. In addition to traditional branches, the production programme embraced a number of new concepts, such as steam (and later electric) locomotives, freight and passenger vehicles, aircraft, ships, machine tools, steam turbines, power-engineering equipment, etc.

In 1923, the company&#x27;s world-famous registered trademark, the winged arrow in a circle, was entered in the Companies Register. The deteriorating political situation in Europe saw arms production rise again in the mid-1930s.

Škoda manufactured the triple-barreled gun turrets for the s of the Austro-Hungarian navy. Prior to World War II, Škoda produced &quot;LT-35&quot; tanks, which are better known under their German designation, &quot;Panzer 35(t)&quot;. They were originally produced for the Czechoslovak Army and were used extensively by the Wehrmacht in the Polish campaign, the Fall of France and the German invasion of the Soviet Union. In July 1944, Škoda started production of the Jagdpanzer 38(t).

In 1924, Škoda Works acquired the Laurin &amp; Klement car manufacturer, later known as Škoda Auto. The companies were separated after 1945, when all of the Czechoslovak economy was nationalised.

=== 1945–1989: after World War II ===

In 1945, the year that nationalisation efforts began in Czechoslovakia, Škoda was nationalised, and many sections were split from the company. The car works in Mladá Boleslav became &quot;Automobilové závody, národní podnik&quot;, AZNP, today&#x27;s Škoda Auto, and the aircraft plant in Prague and truck plant became part of a conglomerate of nine truck producers headquartered in Liberec as LIAZ (&quot;Liberecké automobilové závody&quot;), although the trucks were still marketed as Škodas. Some factories in Slovakia were also split off, and other plants produced food-industry equipment.

The company was renamed &quot;Závody Vladimíra Iljiče Lenina&quot; (&quot;Vladimir Ilyich Lenin Works&quot;) in 1953, but since the new name caused losses of sales abroad, the name was changed back to Škoda in 1965.

The factory concentrated on markets in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc. The company produced a wide range of heavy machinery such as nuclear reactors and locomotives. A lack of updates to its product designs and infrastructure considerably weakened the company&#x27;s competitive position and its brand.

After 1962, Škoda became well known in the Soviet Union and other countries as a trolley bus manufacturer after it began to export Škoda 9 Tr, one of its most successful models. The successor, Škoda 14 Tr, manufactured between 1982 and 1997, is still widely used, for example, in post-Soviet states.

In 1978, the company was turned into the government-owned group of companies (&quot;koncern&quot;) Škoda. It was based in Plzeň and consisted of the companies: První brněnská strojírna (First Machine Works of Brno), ČKD Blansko, ČKD Dukla Praha-Karlín in Prague, Slovenské energetické strojárne S. M. Kirova (Slovak S. M. Kirov Energy Machine Works) in Tlmače, and Výzkumný ústav energetických zařízení (Energy Facilities Research Institute) in Brno.

=== 1989–2011: after fall of communism ===

After the Communist Party lost power in late 1989, the company was privatized into the hands of management. Mismanagement and asset stripping led to a collapse. The company was restructured and some factories closed. Except for some smaller companies named Škoda and Škoda Auto, after the chaotic 1990s period, the Czech Škoda companies were again regrouped within the holding company &quot;Škoda Holding a.s.&quot; in 2000. In 2010, the holding company changed its name to &quot;Škoda Investment, a.s.&quot;.

Following the change in the political climate in 1989, Škoda started along a path of privatisation and used the time to come up with an optimal production programme, make new business contacts and look for markets other than those that had so far been its priority markets, communist countries.

In 1991, a foreign partner for the passenger car works &quot;Škoda Auto a.s.&quot; was sought by the Czech government. Volkswagen was chosen, and the German firm initially took a 30% stake, rising to 100% ownership by 1999. Škoda Auto is now a completely-independent entity from other companies bearing the Škoda name.

In 1992, the company was privatised by the so-called Czech method. It began expanding its production activities, acquiring the Tatra and LIAZ vehicle works and constructing a plant to produce aluminum soft drink cans. The expansion put the company&#x27;s financial stability in jeopardy. In 1999, it concluded an agreement with creditor banks, and the restructuring of the entire capital structure of the Škoda group was undertaken. The result was the legal and financial stability at the company. Currently, a sectoral restructuring of production companies in the group is under way. In April 2000, Škoda Holding a.s. took over the helm, controlling nineteen primary subsidiaries and most product lines.

In 2003, the Czech government sold its 49% stake to the Appian Group for 350 million CZK; (in 2020, equivalent to 14.78 million USD) later that year the Appian Group acquired the rest of its stake in a liquidation of the previous owner. The Appian Group is a holding company incorporated in the Netherlands and controlled through a screen of shell companies. The real owner or owners are unknown, despite investigations by the Czech police. In September 2010, a group of four current or former Škoda or Appian managers announced that it would acquire Škoda from Appian for an undisclosed price. The Czech media speculated that the acquisition was only a formality, as the managers probably owned the parent company Appian.

Škoda was then focused solely on the transport sector. Other divisions have been sold, a large part of them to the Russian company OMZ (the price was not published, estimated at 1 billion CZK). Some smaller transport companies were acquired, such as part of the Hungarian company Ganz, VÚKV (owner of the Velim railway test circuit) and some transport-related assets of the former ČKD, now called Škoda Vagonka. In 2009, Škoda holding announced that the South Korean conglomerate Doosan would acquire its power section for 11,5 billion CZK (US$656 million). Finally, in March 2011, Škoda sold its Škoda Transportation subsidiary to Cyprus-based company Škoda Industry (Europe) Ltd, later renamed CEIL (Central Europe Industries) Ltd.

As of 2012, Škoda Investment still owns the Škoda brand and some real estate but does not perform any industrial activity. Between 2007 and 2012, the company paid dividends to Appian, a sum of 32 billion CZK (1.18 billion euro or US$1.6 billion).

== Former subsidiaries ==

<text>Pussyfoot was a British recording act of the late 1970s. The act consisted of songwriter, producer and musician Mick Flinn, and vocalist Donna Jones. Flinn remained behind the scenes, and Jones was marketed as a solo artist.

==Biography==
===Early 1970s===
Flinn had been a member of Australian rock band The Mixtures from 1967 to 1972, which included the band&#x27;s most successful period. With consecutive number 1 songs in Australia in 1970, &quot;The Pushbike Song&quot; and &quot;In the Summertime&quot;. The Mixtures made the trip to England in January 1971, returned to Australia in November for a concert tour, and then returned to England in January 1972. Flinn left the band in May 1972, eventually settling permanently in the UK. In the UK, Flinn formed The Springfield Revival with Ray Martin and Donna Jones. Flinn subsequently became Jones&#x27; manager-writer-producer.

===1975-1984: Pussyfoot===
In 1975, Pussyfoot recorded the soft rock song &quot;The Way That You Do It&quot; which was released in June 1975, and first attracted public attention when the song&#x27;s suggestive lyrics caused it to be banned by the BBC. The song was re-released under the title &quot;Ooh Na Na Hiya&quot; in 1976, but did not chart.

In Australia, the television show &quot;Countdown&quot; began playing the video clip, and exploited the British ban on playing the song. Over several months, Jones became a sensation and a sex symbol. The song was released as a single by EMI Australia in 1976 and spent seven weeks at number one on the singles chart from 31 January 1977. &quot;The Way That You Do It&quot; was the second highest single in Australia in 1977

&quot;Ooh Ja Ja&quot; was released in Australian 1977 and peaked at number 20 in Australia. Pussyfoot toured Australia in April 1977 promoting their debut studio album, &quot;Pussyfootin&#x27; Round... With Love&quot;.

In 1978, Pussyfoot released a second studio album, featuring the singles &quot;&quot;A Night to Remember&quot; and &quot;Dancer Dance&quot;, which reached number three on the British club charts.

Flinn formed the Mick Flinn Band in 1978; Jones joined The New Seekers in 1979.

In 1980, Jones fronted a female band of Fiona Tucker, Jude Allen, Jackie Dixon and Annabel Rees with Mick Flinn on bass that adopted her previous stage name Pussyfoot, and the group entered the Song for Europe 1980 contest, in an attempt to represent the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest with the song &quot;I Want to Be Me&quot;. Pussyfoot came fourth in the contest, with media commentators speculating after the event that Jones was, once again, too raunchy for British tastes.

In 1984, Pussyfoot released The Australian-only single &quot;Mind Over Matter&quot; that failed to chart.

===1985-present: Post Pussyfoot===
Jones returned to The New Seekers in the late 1980s as a replacement for Vivien Banks who had been a member of the 1976 group Co-Co. Jones had previously been in the girl trio Chrys-Do-Lyns along with fellow New Seekers bandmate Lyn Paul.

Flinn worked with Peter Morris of the band Black Lace for the 1984 UK Top 40 hit &quot;Do the Conga&quot;, and joined The New Seekers in 2002.
