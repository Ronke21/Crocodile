<text>Joseph Quesada (; born January 12, 1962) is an American comic book artist, writer, editor, and television producer. He became known in the 1990s for his work on various Valiant Comics books, such as &quot;Ninjak&quot; and &quot;Solar, Man of the Atom&quot;. He later worked on numerous books for DC Comics and Marvel Comics, such as &quot;&quot; and &quot;X-Factor&quot;, before forming his own company, Event Comics, where he published his creator-owned character, Ash.

In 1998 he became an editor of Marvel Comics&#x27; Marvel Knights line, before becoming editor-in-chief of the company in 2000. He was named chief creative officer of Marvel Entertainment in 2010 and left his editor-in-chief role in January 2011, being replaced by Axel Alonso. His position was re-titled as executive vice president and creative director in October 2019. He left the company in 2022.

==Early life==
Quesada was born in New York City to Cuban-born parents, and grew up in the Jackson Heights neighborhood of Queens, 15 blocks from Shea Stadium, which his father helped build as part of the construction crew. The first comic book he became an ardent fan of was &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, which he began reading around issue #98, the last issue of a historic anti-drug storyline, which garnered his father&#x27;s approval. As the character resonated with him (in part because both grew up in Queens), Spider-Man remains a character he particularly enjoys drawing.

Quesada majored in illustration at the School of Visual Arts, from which he graduated with a BFA in 1984. Though he had drifted away from comics, having come to think of them as a child&#x27;s medium, his interest in them was renewed at age 25 when a friend who learned of his interest in art showed him Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;.

==Career==
===Writer and artist===
Quesada&#x27;s comics career began in 1990 when he was hired by DC Comics on the basis of his 12-page portfolio, which was composed of three three-page sequences, plus a cover for each. These included a Superman story intended to show reviewers from DC Comics that he could handle their characters; an X-Men sequence to display both his ability to depict the characters of Marvel Comics and his ability to handle groups of characters; and a vignette of two people having coffee, which Quesada included to show his ability to illustrate non-superhero stories.

Among Quesada&#x27;s earliest widely distributed work was for Valiant Comics, specifically penciled interiors and covers for &quot;Ninjak&quot;, &quot;Solar, Man of the Atom&quot; and others. His art was heavily influenced by Alex Toth, Mike Mignola, and Alphonse Mucha. At DC Comics, he and writer Jack C. Harris co-created an updated version of the Golden Age character The Ray. Quesada co-created the character Azrael with writer Dennis O&#x27;Neil for the 1992 &quot;Batman: Sword of Azrael&quot; miniseries.

Later, Quesada and his inking partner Jimmy Palmiotti, formed a publishing company, Event Comics, and co-created Ash, a firefighter with superpowers. Quesada cites his editorial experience with Event, and the creators he formed relationships with during that period as that which best prepared him for the later role of Marvel&#x27;s editor-in-chief.

===Marvel Comics===
====Marvel Knights====
In 1998, Marvel Comics, which had just filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, asked Quesada to work for Marvel in a more exclusive capacity, and contracted him and his partners to produce a line of Marvel books dubbed &quot;Marvel Knights&quot;. As editor of Marvel Knights, Quesada worked on a number of low-profile characters such as &quot;Daredevil&quot;, &quot;Punisher&quot;, &quot;The Inhumans,&quot; and &quot;Black Panther&quot;, encouraging experimentation and using his contacts in the independent comics world to bring in creators such as David W. Mack, Mike Oeming, Brian Michael Bendis, Garth Ennis, and Steve Dillon. Quesada also illustrated a &quot;Daredevil&quot; story written by film director Kevin Smith.

====Editor-in-chief====

Two and a half years after starting Marvel Knights, Joe Quesada became editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics in 2000, following Bob Harras&#x27;s departure from the company. At the same time, Bill Jemas succeeded to the presidency of the company. The relationship culminated in the establishment of the Ultimate line of Marvel titles, which were aimed at new readers and took place outside of the restrictive continuity of the Marvel Universe.

In the mid-2000s, Quesada imposed a moratorium on the practice of creatively bringing back characters thought to be dead, known as &quot;dead is dead.&quot; In a January 2008 interview in which he was questioned about numerous characters that had since been resurrected, Quesada clarified that the policy was for writers to exercise forethought and caution before killing off characters or resurrecting them, so that such plots were not produced too frequently or without gravitas, and not that it be entirely prohibited.

Joe Quesada&#x27;s predecessor as Marvel editor-in-chief, Bob Harras, canceled and restarted all of Marvel&#x27;s titles that were not either X-Men-related or at fewer than 100 issues already. This was an effort to shore up sagging sales with a new #1 issue for each of Marvel&#x27;s popular titles, issued at a time shortly after the 1990s bust of the comic book collecting market, and when Marvel was in the throes of bankruptcy. Quesada reversed this policy first by showing the &quot;old&quot;, combined issue numbers beside the &quot;new&quot; numbers on covers (the difference between the two issue numbers shown on the cover would always be the number of issues that the series had before Harras restarted it), and then definitively restoring the &quot;old&quot; numbers for &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;Avengers&quot; when they each passed the 500 mark.

Quesada was involved in the creation of three successful Marvel imprints:
* Marvel Knights, aimed at telling standalone tales, with Jimmy Palmiotti (before his tenure as editor-in-chief)
* MAX, aimed at adult-only readers, with Brian Michael Bendis
* Ultimate, aimed at new readers, with Brian Michael Bendis and Mark Millar

Critics of Quesada&#x27;s policy of emphasizing trade paperbacks charge that they cannibalize monthly comic book sales, because readers may opt to forgo monthly series in order to wait for the cheaper collections, not realizing that monthly sales are an indicator to publishers of interest in such collections.

When confronted with a backlash by fans due to his decision to dictate a controversial retcon of Peter Parker&#x27;s marriage to Mary Jane Watson in the &quot;One More Day&quot; storyline, Quesada participated in a series of interviews on the subject to address the issue of the marriage, comparing it to real life marriages. He also promoted and praised the MC2 title &quot;Spider-Girl&quot; for continuing to provide fans with a stable marriage and an expanded family, although that title was later canceled and relaunched multiple times, eventually being cancelled for good in 2010.

In June 2009 Quesada began writing a weekly column for Comic Book Resources called &quot;Cup O&#x27; Joe&quot;, in which he answers questions every Friday from readers or provides information on Marvel projects.

On February 10, 2010, Quesada issued a public apology for the content of &quot;Captain America&quot; #602, which had drawn condemnation from national Tea Party leaders, for its depiction of an apparent Tea Party protest, and the black superhero Falcon, reacting to it by saying that he would not be welcomed by a crowd of &quot;angry white folks.&quot; Also at issue was the slogans on some of the signs held by the protestors. Quesada stated that future reprints of that story would have the offending material omitted.

====Chief Creative Officer and continued art====

On June 2, 2010, Marvel announced that it promoted Joe Quesada to chief creative officer of Marvel Entertainment. In this position Quesada will help ensure that all portrayals of Marvel&#x27;s characters and stories remain true to the essence of Marvel history. He will also oversee the creative aspects of media adaptations of Marvel properties, which include participating in story and script development.

On January 4, 2011, Quesada stepped down as editor-in-chief, and was replaced by Axel Alonso. After being given the additional job of CCO, in 2010, Quesada explained to Comic Book Resources, &quot;With my increased travel schedule over the last year plus, I&#x27;ve only been able to work with the publishing division in a more macro sense, or as you put it, a more, &quot;big picture,&quot; sense. During this time, Tom and Axel have been handling the more detailed functions of the stories within our comics. My role has been one in which I work on the larger stories and the overall flavor and feel of our books and universe.&quot;

Quesada later elaborated on this decision in a 2011 interview with &quot;Visual Arts Journal&quot;, a publication of his alma mater, the School of Visual Arts, by saying that he always viewed the editor in chief position as a finite one that he would leave after he accomplished what he had set out to, and that the then-recent purchase of Marvel by Disney opened up opportunities he wanted to explore. Quesada contrasted his former editor in chief role as one in which he was solely focused on rebuilding Marvel&#x27;s editorial division and overseeing its comics content, with his Chief Creative Officer role as one in which he would be involved creatively with several divisions.

With the October 2019 Marvel reorganization that named Kevin Feige as Chief Creative Officer across Marvel Entertainment and Marvel Studios, he would continue to work for Marvel Entertainment with his position re-titled as executive vice president and creative director for Marvel Entertainment. On May 31, 2022, Quesada announced he would part ways with Marvel.

===Post-Marvel career===

After leaving Marvel, Quesada was recruited to Amazon Studios in a first-look deal to develop film and television productions from comic book properties. 

In July 2024, he was announced as the head of a new comic book company called Amazing Comics. A joint venture between Mad Cave Studios and Belgian publisher Dupuis, their first series will be &quot;Disciple&quot;, a reimagining of Shakespeare&#x27;s Hamlet, with Quesada co-writing and drawing.

==Techniques and materials==
When illustrating, Quesada begins with sketches much smaller than the actual size at which he will render the final drawing. He employs a Cintiq drawing tablet when he desires to do a &quot;tighter&quot; digital layout of an illustration. When sketching figures, he will sometimes use photographic reference, and incorporate the photos directly into his sketches during the process of finalizing a layout. Once he makes a final decision on a layout, he will then print it out at full size, and use a light box to pencil it, sometimes altering elements in the design such as lighting or other details.

==Media appearances==
In Kevin Smith&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;Mallrats&quot; Quesada is credited as an artist for the opening sequence featuring fictional comic books covers. He also appears in the closing scene of Smith&#x27;s &quot;Chasing Amy&quot;, alongside frequent collaborator and inker Jimmy Palmiotti, signing comic books at a convention. He later appeared as a pizza delivery man in Smith&#x27;s 2001 film &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot;.

Quesada was one of a number of comics creators that appeared in &quot;Once Upon A Time The Super Heroes&quot;, a 2002 documentary about the creation and evolution of comic book superheroes.

Quesada voices Joe, the owner of the &quot;Q&#x27;s Cup O&#x27; Joe&quot; coffee shop, in the 2017 &quot;Spider-Man&quot; animated series. The character is modeled after Quesada.

==Awards==
* 1993: Diamond Gem Award for Best Cover, for &quot;X-O Manowar&quot; #0

==Personal life==
Quesada lives with his wife, Nanci and their daughter, Carlie, in a loft in the Flatiron District.

Quesada is a fan of the New York Mets.

<doc id="663009" wikidata="Q7296989" url="?curid=663009" title="Rawhide Kid">
<text>The Rawhide Kid (real name: Johnny Bart, originally given as Johnny Clay) is a fictional Old West cowboy appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. A heroic gunfighter of the 19th-century American West who was unjustly wanted as an outlaw, he is one of Marvel&#x27;s most prolific Western characters. He and other Marvel western heroes have on rare occasions guest-starred through time travel in such contemporary titles as &quot;The Avengers&quot; and &quot;West Coast Avengers&quot;. In two mature-audience miniseries, in 2003 and 2010, he is depicted as gay.

==Publication history==
===Atlas Comics===
The Rawhide Kid debuted in the 16-issue &quot;Rawhide Kid&quot; series (March 1955-Sept. 1957) from Marvel&#x27;s 1950s predecessor, Atlas Comics. The original Rawhide Kid was a blonde cowboy, that was never named, used a whip and was friend with the child Randy,

===Marvel Comics===
After a hiatus, the Rawhide Kid was rebooted for what was now Marvel Comics by writer Stan Lee, penciler Jack Kirby and inker Dick Ayers. Continuing the Atlas numbering with issue #17 (Aug. 1960), the title now featured a diminutive yet confident, soft-spoken fast gun constantly underestimated by bullying toughs, varmints, owlhoots, polecats, crooked saloon owners and other archetypes squeezed through the prism of Lee and Kirby&#x27;s anarchic imagination. As in the outsized, exuberantly exaggerated action of the later-to-come World War II series &quot;Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos&quot;, &quot;The Rawhide Kid&quot; was now a freewheeling romp of energetic, almost slapstick action across cattle ranches, horse troughs, corrals, canyons and swinging chandeliers. Stringently moral, the Kid nevertheless showed a gleeful pride in his shooting and his acrobatic fight skills — never picking arguments, but constantly forced to surprise lummoxes far bigger than he was.

Through retcon, aspects of the Atlas and Silver Age characters&#x27; history meshed, so that the unnamed infant son of settlers the Clay family, orphaned by a Cheyenne raid, was raised by Texas Ranger Ben Bart on a ranch near Rawhide, Texas. Older brother Frank Clay, captured by Native Americans, eventually escaped and became a gambler, while eldest brother Joe Clay became sheriff of the town of Willow Flats; neither were in the regular cast, and each died in a guest appearance. Shortly after Johnny&#x27;s 18th birthday, Ben Bart was murdered; Johnny, an almost preternaturally fast and accurate gunman, wounded the killers and left them to be taken into custody. A later misunderstanding between the Kid and a sheriff over a cattle rustler that the Kid wounded in self-defense led to the hero&#x27;s life as a fugitive.

Rawhide Kid&#x27;s full name was revealed in issue # 60 in the Letter&#x27;s Column as John Barton Clay. &quot;The Rawhide Kid&quot; ended publication with issue #151 (May 1979).

The Rawhide Kid later appeared as a middle-aged character in a four-issue miniseries, &quot;The Rawhide Kid&quot; (vol. 2) (Aug.-Nov. 1985), by writer Bill Mantlo and penciler Herb Trimpe.

====2000s treatments====
The Rawhide Kid reappeared in the four-issue miniseries &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot; (Feb.-March 2000; published biweekly), by writer John Ostrander and artist Leonardo Manco, and a 2002 four-issue sequel, &quot;Apache Skies&quot;, by the same creative team.

In contrast to the character&#x27;s previously depicted appearance — a small-statured, clean-cut redhead — these latter two series depicted him with shoulder-length dark hair, and wearing a slightly less stylized, more historically appropriate outfit than his classic one.

A five-issue miniseries, &quot;Rawhide Kid&quot; (vol. 3) (April–June 2003), titled &quot;Slap Leather&quot; was published biweekly by Marvel&#x27;s mature-audience MAX imprint. Here, the character was depicted as homosexual, with a good portion of the dialogue dedicated to innuendo to this effect.

A sequel miniseries, &quot;The Rawhide Kid&quot; (vol. 4) (Aug.-Nov. 2010), rendered with a subtitle on covers as &quot;Rawhide Kid: The Sensational Seven&quot;, found the Kid and his posse (consisting of Kid Colt, Doc Holliday, Annie Oakley, Billy the Kid, Red Wolf and the Two-Gun Kid) track the villainous Cristo Pike after Pike and his gang kidnap Wyatt and Morgan Earp.

==Fictional character biography==

Johnny Clay was born in 1850 and orphaned as an infant, adopted by Ben Bart. In 1868 his &quot;uncle&quot; was murdered and he left the family ranch. In 1869 he became a wanted man. In 1870 he fought the Living Totem. In 1872 he captured the costumed Grizzly with the help of the Two-Gun Kid. He joined Kid Colt to defeat Iron Mask. In 1873 he met the Avengers In 1874 he met Doc Holliday. In 1875, he helped the Black Panther with Kid Colt and the Two-Gun Kid. In 1876 the Rawhide Kid, Kid Colt and the Two-Gun Kid faced Red Raven, Iron Mask and the Living Totem with the help of the Avengers. In 1879 he met the Apache Kid. Subsequently, he became a performer for Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show where he remained until 1885. In 1897 he took an understudy under his tutelage.

==Other versions==
===&quot;Marvel Zombies&quot;===
When a meteorite landed on Earth-483, it emitted radiation that resurrected the Rawhide Kid&#x27;s corpse and all of the corpses buried in the adjacent Boot Hill as zombies. The Rawhide Kid and the other reanimated gunslingers invade a nearby town before being killed by Hurricane.

===&quot;Secret Wars&quot;===
During the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, the Rawhide Kid appears as a member of the Thor Corps who guards a Wild West-themed domain of Battleworld called the Valley of Doom. He arrested that region&#x27;s version of Hank Pym for illegal possession of adamantium, which led to Pym being banished to the Ultron-infested domain of Perfection.

==In other media==
The Rawhide Kid appears in &quot;Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2&quot;.

==Reception==

Comic Book Resources placed the 2000 series depiction of the Rawhide Kid as one of the superheroes Marvel wants you to forget.

<text>Marville is a 2002 comic book limited series published by American company Marvel Comics. The series was written by Bill Jemas, and the stories involve satirical comments on comic book industry conventions and trends.

==Plot==
In the year 5002, Ted Turner and Jane Fonda have a son named Kal-AOL (a pun on Kal-El), whom they send back in time to the year 2002 to save him when they believe a meteor strike will destroy the Earth. Al attempts to become a superhero, despite his lack of superpowers, and becomes friends with a cab driver named Mickey and a police officer named Lucy. Although Al becomes rich and famous for capturing criminals, he is upset that crime is still rampant. In the year 5002, the world was not actually destroyed, and Ted Turner sends the time machine back to Al so he can come home. Instead, Al uses the time machine to travel to the dawn of creation and meet God, so he can determine the meaning of life and the nature of morality so he can be a proper hero.

At the dawn of time they meet a man named Jack, who is ambiguous as to if he is actually God or not. Jack takes them through the creation of life on Earth and then to the Jurassic period, and then to the evolution of the first human beings as nomadic hunter-gatherers led by Wolverine, the first human being. Along the way, Jack discusses with them the means behind which life evolved in this manner and why, among other philosophical concepts, and the characters come to the conclusion that God is responsible for engineering life and guiding its evolution. Jack explains he is showing them these events because World War III is going to happen, and he wants them to understand the nature of war so they can work to prevent it.

In the year 2002, Al pitches his story to the head of an unspecified comics company, framed as a recap of the events of the comic (though several things Al mentions did not occur in previous issues in the manner he claims). The unseen editor likes the story, but refuses to turn it into a comic because he believes it will not sell to mainstream audiences. Issue #6 ends with an open letter from Jemas discussing his experiences with publishing the comic and announcing the creation of a new Marvel imprint, Epic Comics; issue #7 does not actually contain any story content related to the events of &quot;Marville&quot; and is a submissions guideline book for creators on how to submit their work to Epic Comics.

==U-Decide==
Marville was created as part of Marvel&#x27;s U-Decide promotional campaign, in which fans would decide which of three books would survive. The event involved one existing book (Peter David&#x27;s &quot;Captain Marvel&quot;, whose numbering was restarted at issue #1) and two new books (&quot;Marville&quot; and Ron Zimmerman&#x27;s &quot;Ultimate Adventures&quot;), and was based around a bet between David and Jemas, of which Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada later became a part. Jemas changed the stakes of the bet a few issues into &quot;Marville&quot;, stating that the loser would take a pie in the face for charity. Despite this, both &quot;Marville&quot; and &quot;Ultimate Adventures&quot; ended fairly quickly, while the rebooted &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; would last 25 more issues, for a total of 60 issues when combined with the first run.

==Reception==
For its confusing plot, wanton sexuality, and thinly veiled promotional nature, &quot;Marville&quot; was universally panned by critics, and is regularly referred to as one of the worst comics of all time.

&quot;ComicsAlliance&quot; included &quot;Marville&quot; in their list of the 15 Worst Comics of the Decade, calling it little more than a &quot;publicity stunt&quot;, and Rob Bricken of io9 likened the work to &quot;shooting heroin directly into your adrenal gland.&quot;

&quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked Kal-AOL (and the rest of the &quot;Marville&quot; cast) as one of the &quot;superheroes that Marvel wants you to forget.&quot;

&quot;The A.V. Club&quot; called it &quot;abominable&quot;, &quot;nearly unpublishable&quot;, and — despite its professional-quality production values — &quot;fundamentally amateurish&quot;, condemning Jemas for using the Marvel corporation as &quot;a vanity press for himself&quot;.

<text>&quot;Dom&quot; Luís Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal, Duke of Braganza (; 21 March 1887 – 1 February 1908) was the eldest son and heir-apparent of King Carlos I of Portugal. He was born in 1887 when his father was still Prince Royal of Portugal and received the usual style of the heirs to the heir of the Portuguese crown: 4th Prince of Beira at birth, with the subsidiary title 14th Duke of Barcelos. After his grandfather King Luís I of Portugal died, he became Prince Royal of Portugal with the subsidiary titles 21st Duke of Braganza, 20th Marquis of Vila Viçosa, 28th count of Barcelos, 25th count of Ourém, 23rd count of Arraiolos and 22nd count of Neiva.

==Early life==

&quot;Luís Filipe Maria Carlos Amélio Fernando Víctor Manuel António Lourenço Miguel Rafael Gabriel Gonzaga Xavier Francisco de Assis Bento&quot; was born in Lisbon, the elder son of Carlos, Prince Royal of Portugal (later King Carlos I of Portugal), and Princess Amélie d&#x27;Orléans, a member of the House of Braganza.

Two years after his birth, Dom Luís Filipe inherited all his father&#x27;s royal princely titles when his father became king. He was himself re-styled Prince Royal, and at the same time inherited the Dukedom of Braganza (as 21st Duke), which brought with it the largest private fortune in Portugal at that time, completely at the disposal of the heir to the Portuguese crown. 

In 1907, the Prince Royal acted as regent of the kingdom while his father was outside the country. The same year he made a very successful official visit to the Portuguese colonies in Africa, the first member of the royal family ever to visit them.

Dom Luís Filipe was the pupil of the African war hero Mouzinho de Albuquerque, and like all the Braganzas, showed many aptitudes in the arts, besides his pursuing a military education. Around the time of Dom Luís Filipe&#x27;s assassination, negotiations for marriage to his cousin Princess Patricia of Connaught were underway. Princess Patricia was the granddaughter of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the daughter of British Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, and Princess Louise Margaret of Prussia.

==Lisbon Regicide==

On 1 February 1908, Luís Filipe and his family were returning to Lisbon from Vila Viçosa Palace. Alfredo Luís da Costa and Manuel Buiça, two members of a revolutionary society called the Carbonária, shot at all the royal family, hitting his father King Carlos, Luís Filipe, and his younger brother Infante Manuel, Duke of Beja. Carlos I died immediately, while Luís Filipe lived for another twenty minutes. Manuel survived the attack, having only been shot in the arm, while the queen was unharmed. 

Manuel succeeded to the throne as Manuel II. Luís Filipe is buried next to his father and forefathers in the Royal Pantheon of the House of Braganza in Lisbon. His younger brother, King Manuel II of Portugal, and his mother, Queen Maria Amélia, are buried opposite.

On 5 October 1910, the monarchy under the reign of his surviving younger brother, Manuel II, was overthrown in a military coup and the Portuguese First Republic was established.

<doc id="663022" wikidata="Q1999032" url="?curid=663022" title="Securities Exchange Act of 1934">
<text>The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (also called the Exchange Act, &#x27;34 Act, or 1934 Act) (, codified at et seq.) is a law governing the secondary trading of securities (stocks, bonds, and debentures) in the United States of America. A landmark piece of wide-ranging legislation, the Act of &#x27;34 and related statutes form the basis of regulation of the financial markets and their participants in the United States. The 1934 Act also established the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the agency primarily responsible for enforcement of United States federal securities law.

Companies raise billions of dollars by issuing securities in what is known as the primary market. Contrasted with the Securities Act of 1933, which regulates these original issues, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 regulates the secondary trading of those securities between persons often unrelated to the issuer, frequently through brokers or dealers. Trillions of dollars are made and lost each year through trading in the secondary market.

==Securities exchanges==
One area subject to the 1934 Act&#x27;s regulation is the physical place where securities (stocks, bonds, notes of debenture) are exchanged. Here, agents of the exchange, or specialists, act as middlemen for the competing interests in the buying and selling of securities. An important function of the specialist is to inject liquidity and price continuity into the market. Some of the more well known exchanges include the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ and the NYSE American.

==Securities associations==
The 1934 Act also regulates broker-dealers without a status for trading securities. A telecommunications infrastructure has developed to provide for trading without a physical location. Previously these brokers would find stock prices through newspaper printings and conduct trades verbally by telephone. Today, a digital information network connects these brokers. This system is called NASDAQ, standing for the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System.

==Self-regulatory organizations (SRO)==
In 1938, the Exchange Act was amended by the Maloney Act, which authorized the formation and registration of national securities associations. These groups would supervise the conduct of their members subject to the oversight of the SEC. The Maloney Act led to the creation of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. – the NASD, which is a Self-Regulatory Organization (or SRO). The NASD had primary responsibility for oversight of brokers and brokerage firms, and later, the NASDAQ stock market. In 1996, the SEC criticized the NASD for putting its interests as the operator of NASDAQ ahead of its responsibilities as the regulator, and the organization was split in two, one entity regulating the brokers and firms, the other regulating the NASDAQ market. In 2007, the NASD merged with the NYSE (which had already taken over the AMEX), and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) was created.

==Other trading platforms==
In the last 30 years, brokers have created two additional systems for trading securities. The alternative trading system, or ATS, is a quasi exchange where stocks are commonly purchased and sold through a smaller, private network of brokers, dealers, and other market participants. The ATS is distinguished from exchanges and associations in that the volumes for ATS trades are comparatively low, and the trades tend to be controlled by a small number of brokers or dealers. ATS acts as a niche market, a private pool of liquidity. &quot;Reg ATS&quot;, an SEC regulation issued in the late 1990s, requires these small markets to 1) register as a broker with the NASD, 2) register as an exchange, or 3) operate as an unregulated ATS, staying under low trading caps.

A specialized form of ATS, the Electronic Communications Network (or ECN), has been described as the &quot;black box&quot; of securities trading. The ECN is a completely automated network, anonymously matching buy and sell orders. Many traders use one or more trading mechanisms (the exchanges, NASDAQ, and an ECN or ATS) to effect large buy or sell orders – conscious of the fact that overreliance on one market for a large trade is likely to unfavorably alter the trading price of the target security.

==Issues==
While the 1933 Act recognizes that timely information about the issuer is vital to effective pricing of securities, the 1933 Act&#x27;s disclosure requirement (the registration statement and prospectus) is a one-time affair. The 1934 Act extends this requirement to securities traded in the secondary market. Provided that the company has more than a certain number of shareholders and has a certain amount of assets (500 shareholders, above $10 million in assets, per Act sections 12, 13, and 15), the 1934 Act requires that issuers regularly file company information with the SEC on certain forms (the annual 10-K filing and the quarterly 10-Q filing). The filed reports are available to the public via EDGAR. If something material happens with the company (change of CEO, change of auditing firm, destruction of a significant number of company assets), the SEC requires that the company issue within 4 business days an 8-K filing that reflects these changed conditions (see Regulation FD). With these regularly required filings, buyers are better able to assess the worth of the company, and buy and sell the stock according to that information.

==Antifraud provisions==
While the 1933 Act contains an antifraud provision (Section 17), when the 1934 Act was enacted, questions remained about the reach of that antifraud provision and whether a private right of action—that is, the right of an individual private citizen to sue an issuer of stock or related market actor, as opposed to government suits—existed for purchasers. As it developed, section 10(b) of the 1934 Act and corresponding SEC Rule 10b-5 have sweeping antifraud language. Section 10(b) of the Act (as amended) provides (in pertinent part):

Section 10(b) is codified at .

The breadth and utility of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 in the pursuit of securities litigation are significant. Rule 10b-5 has been employed to cover insider trading cases, but has also been used against companies for price fixing (artificially inflating or depressing stock prices through stock manipulation), bogus company sales to increase stock price, and even a company&#x27;s failure to communicate relevant information to investors. Many plaintiffs in the securities litigation field plead violations of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 as a &quot;catch-all&quot; allegation, in addition to violations of the more specific antifraud provisions in the 1934 Act.

== Exemptions from reporting because of national security==
Section 13(b)(3)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provides that &quot;with respect to matters concerning the national security of the United States&quot;, the President or the head of an Executive Branch agency may exempt companies from certain critical legal obligations. These obligations include keeping accurate &quot;books, records, and accounts&quot; and maintaining &quot;a system of internal accounting controls sufficient&quot; to ensure the propriety of financial transactions and the preparation of financial statements in compliance with &quot;generally accepted accounting principles&quot;.

On May 5, 2006, in a notice in the Federal Register, President Bush delegated authority under this section to John Negroponte, the Director of National Intelligence. Administration officials told &quot;Business Week&quot; that they believe this is the first time a President has ever delegated the authority to someone outside the Oval Office.

<doc id="663023" wikidata="Q3527226" url="?curid=663023" title="Linear speedup theorem">
<text>In computational complexity theory, the linear speedup theorem for Turing machines states that given any real &quot;c&quot; &gt; 0 and any &quot;k&quot;-tape Turing machine solving a problem in time &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), there is another &quot;k&quot;-tape machine that solves the same problem in time at most , where &quot;k&quot; &gt; 1.
If the original machine is non-deterministic, then the new machine is also non-deterministic.
The constants 2 and 3 in 2&quot;n&quot; + 3 can be lowered, for example, to &quot;n&quot; + 2.

==Proof==
The construction is based on packing several tape symbols of the original machine &quot;M&quot; into one tape symbol of the new machine &quot;N&quot;.
It has a similar effect as using longer words and commands in processors: it speeds up the computations but increases the machine size.
How many old symbols are packed into a new symbol depends on the desired speed-up.

Suppose the new machine packs three old symbols into a new symbol.
Then the alphabet of the new machine is formula_1: it consists of the original symbols and the packed symbols.
The new machine has the same number &quot;k&quot; &gt; 1 of tapes.
A state of &quot;N&quot; consists of the following components:
* the state of &quot;M&quot;;
* for each tape, three packed symbols that describe the packed symbol under the head, the packed symbol on the left, and the packed symbol on the right; and
* for each tape, the original head position within the packed symbol under the head of &quot;N&quot;.
The new machine &quot;N&quot; starts with encoding the given input into a new alphabet (that is why its alphabet must include formula_2).
For example, if the input to 2-tape &quot;M&quot; is on the left, then after the encoding the tape configuration of &quot;N&quot; is on the right:
The new machine packs three old symbols (e.g., the blank symbol &quot;_&quot;, the symbol &quot;a&quot;, and the symbol &quot;b&quot;) into a new symbol (here (_,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;)) and copies it the second tape, while erasing the first tape.
At the end of the initialization, the new machine directs its head to the beginning.
Overall, this takes 2&quot;n&quot; + 3 steps.

After the initialization, the state of &quot;N&quot; is formula_3, where the symbol formula_4 means that it will be filled in by the machine later; the symbol formula_5 means that the head of the original machine points to the first symbols inside formula_6 and formula_7. Now the machine starts simulating &quot;m&quot; = 3 transitions of &quot;M&quot; using six of its own transitions (in this concrete case, there will be no speed up, but in general &quot;m&quot; can be much larger than six).
Let the configurations of &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; be:
where the bold symbols indicate the head position.
The state of &quot;N&quot; is formula_8.
Now the following happens:
* &quot;N&quot; moves right, left, left, right. After the four moves, the machine &quot;N&quot; has all its formula_4 filled, and its state becomes formula_10
* Now &quot;N&quot; updates its symbols and state according to &quot;m&quot; = 3 transitions of the original machine. This may require two moves (update the current symbol and update one of its adjacent symbols). Suppose the original machine moves as follows (with the corresponding configuration of &quot;N&quot; on the right):
Thus, the state of &quot;N&quot; becomes formula_11.

=== Complexity ===
Initialization requires 2&quot;n&quot; + 3 steps. In the simulation, 6 steps of &quot;N&quot; simulate &quot;m&quot; steps of &quot;M&quot;. Choosing &quot;m&quot; &gt; 6&quot;c&quot; produces the running time bounded by formula_12

== Machines with a read-only input tape ==
The theorem as stated above also holds for
Turing machines with 1-way, read-only input tape
and formula_13 work tapes.

== Single-tape machines ==
For single-tape Turing machines, linear speedup holds for machines with execution time at least formula_14. It provably does not hold for machines with time formula_15.

== Dependence on tape compression ==
The proof of the speedup theorem clearly hinges on the capability to compress storage by replacing the alphabet with a larger one.
Geffert showed that for
nondeterministic single-tape Turing machines of time complexity formula_16 linear speedup can be achieved without increasing the alphabet.

== Dependence on the shape of storage ==
Regan considered a property of a computational model called information vicinity. This property is related to the memory structure: a Turing machine has linear vicinity, while a Kolmogorov-Uspenskii machine and other pointer machines have an exponential one. Regan’s thesis is that the existence of linear speedup has to do with having a polynomial information vicinity. The salient point in this claim is that a model with exponential vicinity will not have speedup even if changing the alphabet is allowed (for models with a discrete memory that stores symbols). Regan did not, however, prove any general theorem of this kind. Hühne proved that if we require the speedup to be obtained by an on-line simulation (which is the case for the speedup on ordinary Turing machines), then linear speedup does not exist on machines with tree storage.

<text>Essex man and Mondeo man are stereotypical figures which were popularised in 1990s Britain. The &quot;Essex man&quot; as a political figure is an example of a type of median voter and was used to help explain the electoral successes of Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s. The closely related &quot;Mondeo man&quot; was identified as the sort of voter the Labour Party needed to attract to win the election in 1997. Basildon man and woman are narrower terms being used synonymously.

==Background==
Although the Labour Party was traditionally considered the &quot;natural choice&quot; for the working class, there has traditionally been a group within that class who have voted Conservative, who are distinct from the &quot;Essex man&quot; phenomenon. After the Second World War, there was considerable social change in South East England. Working-class English families were encouraged to leave the war-damaged slums in inner London and move to newly built council-owned properties in the suburbs and new towns in the home counties, including Basildon and Harlow in Essex. With the decline of manufacturing and skilled manual work in the 1980s, this group increasingly looked to middle-class professions for employment, or became self-employed.

Their children enjoyed housing, education and employment opportunities far removed from the experiences of their parents.

==Essex man and Thatcherism==
Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s policies during her tenure in office from 1979–90 included: lower taxation, control of inflation and sale of council houses at subsidised prices. These policies (in particular, the right to buy scheme) are thought to have caused many people who had traditionally voted Labour in Essex to switch their allegiance in the elections of 1979, 1983 and 1987.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (&quot;OED&quot;) lists the earliest reference to the Essex man as one from 7 October 1990, in an anonymous article penned by Simon Heffer for &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;. However, the 26 January 1990 issue of &quot;Campaign&quot; has the following reference: &quot;Representative [David Amess] of new Essex man, working class, father electrician, right wing, keen hanger, noisily rambunctious, no subtlety&quot;. Sky UK minidishes on newly purchased council houses were, according to Heffer, symbols of Essex man&#x27;s pride in his prosperity. Owing to the similarities between the politics of Thatcher&#x27;s UK and Ronald Reagan&#x27;s US, the contemporary term &quot;Reagan Democrat&quot; is roughly analogous to &quot;Essex man&quot;.

==Mondeo man==

The concept of the &quot;Mondeo man&quot; was popularised by a phrase used by then Leader of the Labour Party, Tony Blair at the Labour Party Conference in October 1996. He recalled a Ford Sierra owner he had canvassed in the Midlands whilst out campaigning for the 1992 general election. The man was a self-employed electrician, whom Blair met while the man was polishing his car at the weekend, and told Blair that he was an ex-Labour voter who had bought his council house, owned his own car, and wondered what the Labour Party had to offer him given the party&#x27;s history of raising taxes and mortgage rates:

His dad voted Labour, he said. He used to vote Labour, too. But he&#x27;d bought his own house now. He&#x27;d set up his own business. He was doing very nicely. &quot;So I&#x27;ve become a Tory&quot; he said. In that moment, he crystallised for me the basis of our failure... His instincts were to get on in life. And he thought our instincts were to stop him. But that was never our history or our purpose.

This is the story that is often credited with inspiring Blair&#x27;s concept of New Labour, and the &quot;Mondeo man&quot; superseded the &quot;Essex man&quot;, as the target of the campaign for the 1997 general election for the Labour Party. (By 1993, the Sierra had been replaced by the Mondeo in the Ford model range, hence the misquote that gave birth to Mondeo Man). Under the leadership of Blair, Labour subsequently won the 1997 general election, with a record landslide majority of 179 MPs.

<text>The UK Championship is a professional ranking snooker tournament. It is one of snooker&#x27;s prestigious Triple Crown events, along with the World Championship and the Masters. It is usually held at the Barbican, York. Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan has won the tournament a record eight times, followed by Steve Davis with six titles and Stephen Hendry with five. 

==History==
The UK Championship was first held in 1977 in Tower Circus, Blackpool as the United Kingdom Professional Snooker Championship, an event open only to British residents and passport holders. Patsy Fagan won the inaugural tournament by defeating Doug Mountjoy by 12 frames to 9 in the final and won the first prize of £2000. The following year the event moved to the Guild Hall, Preston, where it remained until 1997.

The rules were changed in 1984, when the tournament was granted ranking status and all professionals were allowed to enter. Since then, it has carried more ranking points than any tournament other than the World Championship until being overtaken by the International Championship and the China Open, both of which yield a higher number of ranking points based on the amount of money in pounds sterling on offer for winning the event.

The tournament has seen many memorable finals. In 1977 and 1979, it provided Patsy Fagan and John Virgo with their first and only major tournament wins respectively. In 1980, the tournament was won by Steve Davis, as well as in 1981, when the final between Davis and Terry Griffiths set the stage for four more final battles between the two, who were to dominate the rest of the season before their unexpected losses in the first round of the 1982 World Championship. Runner-up Griffiths became champion next year, in 1982, defeating Alex Higgins, who in turn was the winner of the 1983 event, beating Davis 16–15 after having trailed 0–7 at the end of the first session. Between 1984 and 1987, all four tournaments were won by Davis again. In 1985, Willie Thorne led Davis 13–8 at the start of the evening session, only to miss a simple blue off its spot and lose 16–14. The victory regenerated Davis&#x27;s confidence after his devastating World Championship loss; Thorne, on the other hand, never won another ranking title.

In 1988, Doug Mountjoy became the oldest winner of the tournament at the age of 46, and the second oldest ranking event winner after Ray Reardon (50). Mountjoy produced a stunning display to win 16–12, when he was widely viewed as just making up the numbers against the rising Stephen Hendry. Even more astonishingly, Mountjoy won the Mercantile Credit Classic the following month, which at the time made him only the fourth player to win two ranking tournaments in a row.

Stephen Hendry&#x27;s 1989 win prefigured his decade of dominance similar to the one prefigured by Davis&#x27;s win in 1980; its significance was emphasised by the fact that the losing finalist was Davis himself. Hendry&#x27;s 16–15 win the following year, over Davis again, spoke to his unique qualities of nerve. The final in 1994 against Ken Doherty is considered by many players as one of Hendry&#x27;s best performance, as he won 10–5 making 7 century breaks along the way, six of which were in the span of eight frames played. Doherty has appeared in two more memorable finals, in 2001, when Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan beat him 10–1, delivering a final&#x27;s best winning margin since it had become the best of 19 frames in 1993, a feat repeated three years later, in 2004, by Stephen Maguire against David Gray; and in 2002, when Doherty almost won the tournament against Mark Williams, but lost 9–10 in a dramatic deciding frame.

In 1993, the format of the final was reduced from the best of 31 frames to the best of 19 frames. This is the format still used for the final to the current day. Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan became the youngest-ever winner of the tournament (and any ranking tournament) that year, being just 17 years old at the time. Between 1994 and 1996, the championship was won by Stephen Hendry three times in a row, while from 1997 to 2002, the winner was one of the &#x27;Class of &#x27;92&#x27; each year, with O&#x27;Sullivan, John Higgins and Mark Williams all claiming the title twice during this period.

The 2005 tournament saw Steve Davis, aged 48, reach his first ranking tournament final for almost two years and make his highest break in tournament play for 23 years. In a match that featured the widest age gap between finalists in professional tournament history, he lost 6–10 to the 18-year-old Ding Junhui, who became the first non-British or Irish and the second youngest player after O&#x27;Sullivan to win the UK Championship. The following year, Peter Ebdon won the title by defeating Stephen Hendry 10-6.

In 2007, the tournament was won by Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan for the fourth time, as he beat Stephen Maguire 10–2 in the final. The tournament was also notable for O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s maximum break in the deciding frame of the semi-final, and for the longest televised frame (77 minutes) between Marco Fu and Mark Selby. The 2009 final saw the reigning world champion John Higgins missing an easy brown and the chance to go 8–6 in front, eventually losing to second-time champion Ding Junhui.

The 2010 final turned out to be another dramatic match, instantly described by many commentators as an all-time classic. At one point, John Higgins, playing in his first major tournament after the end of a six-month ban for his involvement in match-fixing discussions, was 5–9 down to Mark Williams. However, he won the next two frames. At 7–9, Williams led by 29 points with only 27 on the table, leaving Higgins requiring a snooker to remain in the tournament. Higgins got the snooker and cleared the colours. Another frame won by Higgins took the match to the decider. Finally, with only brown, blue, pink and black left at the table, Higgins potted the brown into a top pocket by playing cross-double across the long axis of the table and then added a difficult long blue and equally difficult pink, thereby winning the frame and thus the tournament by 10–9. In the emotional post-match interview, he described his win as his finest hour and dedicated it to his terminally ill father.

In 2011 the event returned to the Barbican Centre in York. There was a radical change to the format. All matches up to and including the quarter-finals were changed from the best of 17 frames to the best of 11 frames. In 2013 a 128-player flat draw was used, with all players starting in the first round and all rounds played at the Barbican venue. The tournament was contractually due to stay at the Barbican Centre until 2013, but it also hosted the event in 2014. That year the format was changed once again, with every round up to and including the semi-finals being played over best-of-11 frames. This is the format that is being used to the current day. This tournament saw yet another classic final, as Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan won 10–9 over 2011 winner Judd Trump, who had recovered from 9–4 to take the match into a decider. Besides winning the title for a fifth time, O&#x27;Sullivan also produced a maximum in his last 16 match against Matthew Selt, the third consecutive 147 break in the main stages of the tournament since 2012, following the ones made by John Higgins in 2012 and Mark Selby in 2013, and followed by Neil Robertson&#x27;s maximum in 2015 and Mark Allen&#x27;s in 2016.

Between 2012 and 2018, the event has been won by either Neil Robertson, Mark Selby or Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan. The final line-ups of 2013 and 2016 featured a combination of these three players, with Robertson defeating defending champion Selby in the former, and Selby beating O&#x27;Sullivan in the latter. In 2015, the final featured Australia&#x27;s Neil Robertson and China&#x27;s Liang Wenbo, the first time that a UK Championship final had been contested between two overseas players, an occurrence repeated in 2021, when Chinese player Zhao Xintong played against the Belgian Luca Brecel, who at that point was the first player from mainland Europe to compete in a Triple Crown final. This was the first ever UK Championship final between two players ranked outside the top 16. The 2016 final between Selby and O&#x27;Sullivan saw five century breaks in the final six frames of the match, as Selby won his second UK title. The next two editions of the tournament in 2017 and 2018 were captured by O&#x27;Sullivan, who became the first player since Stephen Hendry in 1996 to successfully defend the title. In addition, O&#x27;Sullivan set a new record for most UK titles with seven, that he would extend to eight in 2023 by beating Ding Junhui, who won the tournament for the third time in 2019, and was a runner-up to Mark Allen in 2022. In the 2020 edition of the event, it was Neil Robertson who became a three-time champion of the tournament, defeating Judd Trump 10–9 in a 7-hour long final with a 66-minute long decider frame.

The UK Championship has had many different sponsors over the years, including Super Crystalate, Tennents, StormSeal, Royal Liver Assurance, Liverpool Victoria, PowerHouse, Travis Perkins, Maplin Electronics, Pukka Pies, 12BET.com, williamhill.com, Coral, Betway, Cazoo, and MrQ. It is one of the tournaments televised by the BBC and is held towards the end of each calendar year.

<doc id="663036" wikidata="Q1606410" url="?curid=663036" title="Sunset Boulevard (musical)">
<text>Sunset Boulevard is a musical with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber, and lyrics and libretto by Don Black and Christopher Hampton. It is based on the 1950 film.

The plot revolves around Norma Desmond, a faded star of the silent screen era, living in the past in her decaying mansion on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. When young screenwriter Joe Gillis accidentally crosses her path, she sees in him an opportunity to make her return to the big screen, with romance and tragedy to follow.

Opening first in London in 1993, the musical has had several long runs internationally and enjoyed extensive tours. However, it has been the subject of several legal battles and ultimately lost money due to its extraordinary running costs.

==Background==
From approximately 1952 to 1956, Gloria Swanson worked with actor Richard Stapley (aka Richard Wyler) and cabaret singer and pianist Dickson Hughes on a musical adaptation originally entitled &quot;Starring Norma Desmond&quot;, then &quot;Boulevard!&quot;. It ended on a happier note than the film, with Norma Desmond allowing Joe Gillis to leave and pursue a happy ending with Betty Schaefer. Rights holder Paramount Pictures originally had given Swanson verbal permission to proceed with the musical, but there had been no formal legal arrangement. On 20 February 1957, Paramount executive Russell Holman wrote to Swanson asking her to cease work on the project because &quot;it would be damaging for the property to be offered to the entertainment public in another form as a stage musical.&quot; In 1994, Hughes incorporated material from the production into &quot;Swanson on Sunset&quot;, based on his and Stapley&#x27;s experiences in writing &quot;Boulevard!&quot;. A recording of the entire score, which had been housed in the Gloria Swanson archives at the University of Texas at Austin, was released on CD in 2008.

In the early 1960s, Stephen Sondheim outlined a musical stage adaptation and went so far as to compose the first scene with librettist Burt Shevelove. A chance encounter with Billy Wilder at a cocktail party gave Sondheim the opportunity to introduce himself and ask the original film&#x27;s co-screenwriter and director his opinion of the project (which was to star Jeanette MacDonald). &quot;You can&#x27;t write a musical about &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;,&quot; Wilder responded, &quot;it has to be an opera. After all, it&#x27;s about a dethroned queen.&quot; Sondheim immediately aborted his plans. A few years later, when he was invited by Hal Prince to write the score for a film remake starring Angela Lansbury as a fading musical comedian rather than a silent film star, Sondheim declined, citing his conversation with Wilder.

When Andrew Lloyd Webber saw the film in the early 1970s, he was inspired to write what he pictured as the title song for a theatrical adaptation, fragments of which he instead incorporated into &quot;Gumshoe&quot;. In 1976, after a conversation with Hal Prince, who had the theatrical rights to &quot;Sunset&quot;, Lloyd Webber wrote &quot;an idea for the moment when Norma Desmond returns to Paramount Studios&quot;; Lloyd Webber did no further work on the play until after 1989&#x27;s &quot;Aspects of Love&quot;. At that point, Lloyd Webber &quot;felt it was the subject [he] had to compose next&quot;, though by February 1990 he had announced plans to turn Really Useful Group private so he could &quot;make movies rather than musicals.&quot;

In 1991, Lloyd Webber asked Amy Powers, a lawyer from New York with hardly any professional lyric-writing experience, to write the lyrics for &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;. Don Black was later brought in to work with Powers; the two wrote the version that was performed in 1991 at Lloyd Webber&#x27;s Sydmonton Festival. This original version starred Ria Jones as Norma and Michael Ball as Joe Gillis, but it was still in the experimental stage and not ready for potential producers. A revised version, written by Black and Christopher Hampton had a complete performance at the 1992 Sydmonton Festival, now with Patti LuPone playing Norma and Kevin Anderson as Joe Gillis. This &quot;met with great success&quot;. Lloyd Webber borrowed several of the tunes from his 1986 mini-musical &quot;Cricket&quot;, written with Tim Rice, which had been performed at Windsor Castle and later at the 1986 Sydmonton Festival.

==Synopsis==
===Act I===
The place: A mansion on Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, 5 a.m. A homicide has been reported. Joe Gillis sets the scene (&quot;Prologue&quot;), noting that &quot;an old-time movie star is involved / Maybe the biggest star of all&quot;, and that, if you want to know the &quot;real facts&quot;, &quot;you&#x27;ve come to the right party.&quot;

Flashback to... Hollywood, 1949 – where a down-on-his-luck screenwriter, Joe Gillis, is trying to hustle up some work at Paramount Studios (&quot;Let&#x27;s Have Lunch&quot;). His appointment with a producer goes poorly when the executive rejects both Joe&#x27;s proposed script and a loan to bring his car payments up to date. Joe does, however, meet Betty Schaefer, a pretty, young script editor who suggests they collaborate to rework one of his earlier screenplays (&quot;Every Movie&#x27;s a Circus&quot;). As they chat, car repossession agents spot Joe, who quickly escapes.

During the ensuing chase, Joe evades his pursuers by pulling in to the garage of a palatial but dilapidated mansion on Sunset Boulevard. Beckoned inside the house, Joe encounters Norma Desmond (&quot;Surrender&quot;), a star actress of the silent-film era. Taken aback, Joe comments, &quot;You used to be in pictures; you used to be big,&quot; to which Norma retorts, &quot;I &quot;am&quot; big – it&#x27;s the pictures that got small!&quot; (&quot;With One Look&quot;)

The gloomy estate is inhabited only by Norma and Max von Mayerling, her loyal butler and chauffeur. Although decades past her prime and mostly forgotten by the public, Norma is convinced she is as beautiful and popular as ever. Max perpetuates this illusion by shielding her from the realities of life out of the limelight and by writing her letters purportedly from still-devoted fans. Norma informs Joe that she plans to make her comeback with &quot;Salome&quot;, a script she has written for Cecil B. DeMille to direct with her in the starring role as the teenage biblical temptress (&quot;Salome&quot;). Dubious but sensing opportunity, Joe accepts her offer to work on editing the script. Norma insists that Joe stay in her home while they collaborate on &quot;Salome&quot; (&quot;The Greatest Star of All&quot;).

Joe immediately realizes the script is incoherent, but because Norma won&#x27;t allow a major rewrite, the revision drags on for months. During this time Joe is virtually imprisoned within the house, but he does break away to fulfill his commitment to Betty. Their working relationship blossoms into a romance that has her reconsidering her engagement to Joe&#x27;s best friend, Artie Green (&quot;Girl Meets Boy&quot;).

Blind to Joe&#x27;s opportunism, Norma lavishes him with gifts that include a wardrobe makeover and he becomes her kept man (&quot;The Lady&#x27;s Paying&quot;). She declares her love for him and turns quite possessive (&quot;The Perfect Year&quot;); when he leaves her to attend Artie&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve party (&quot;This Time Next Year&quot;), she is distraught and attempts suicide. As a conciliatory gesture, Joe reluctantly returns to work on &quot;Salome&quot;.

===Act II===
Joe is now living in luxury at Norma Desmond&#x27;s mansion, for reasons he bluntly states are mercenary (&quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;). A cryptic message from Paramount has Norma certain that DeMille is eager to discuss her script (&quot;There&#x27;s Been A Call&quot;). She drops in on the set of his current film and is greeted warmly by former colleagues and the famed director himself, but he is non-committal about &quot;Salome&quot; (&quot;As If We Never Said Goodbye&quot;). Meanwhile, Max discovers the studio had called to ask about Norma&#x27;s Isotta Fraschini, not her screenplay. However, a delusional Norma leaves the lot convinced she&#x27;ll soon be back in front of the cameras and begins to prepare for the role (&quot;Eternal Youth Is Worth a Little Suffering&quot;). Max tells Joe of the depth of his commitment to protecting Norma from discovering the truth, revealing that he was Norma&#x27;s first husband and has stayed with her all these years (&quot;Surrender&quot; reprise).

Increasingly paranoid, Norma deduces that Joe and Betty are more than just friends (&quot;Too Much in Love to Care&quot;). She calls Betty to reveal Joe&#x27;s secret life at the mansion, but he overhears and grabs the phone to tell Betty to come see for herself. Realizing their affair is doomed, Joe brusquely tells Betty he enjoys being Norma&#x27;s pet and that she should go back to Artie. Betty departs, confused and brokenhearted, and Joe tells Norma he is leaving her and returning to his hometown of Dayton, Ohio. He also bluntly informs her that &quot;Salome&quot; is an unfilmable script and her fans have long abandoned her. Furious and grief-stricken, Norma fatally shoots Joe three times as he storms out of the house.

Now completely insane, Norma mistakes the swarms of police and reporters who arrive for studio personnel. Imagining herself on the set of &quot;Salome&quot;, she slowly descends her grand staircase and utters &quot;And now, Mr. DeMille, I am ready for my close-up.&quot; (&quot;The Final Scene&quot;).

==Productions==

===Original West End production===

The original West End production, directed by Trevor Nunn and choreographed by Bob Avian, with costumes by Anthony Powell, opened on 12 July 1993 at the Adelphi Theatre. The cast featured Patti LuPone as Norma Desmond, Kevin Anderson as Joe Gillis, Meredith Braun as Betty Schaefer, and Daniel Benzali as Max. Billy Wilder and his wife Audrey Young were joined by Nancy Olson, who had played Betty in the original film, at the opening night performance. Wilder said, &quot;The best thing they did was leave the script alone&quot;, and praised LuPone. Reviews were mixed, according to the Associated Press (AP) review summary, quoting the AP critic, Michael Kuchwara: &quot;Some reviewers felt Lloyd Webber took the sting out of a cynical tale. Wilder&#x27;s bitter brew has been diluted. ... When LuPone is off stage, the show sags.&#x27;&quot; Frank Rich wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;:
The show closed for three weeks, re-opening on 19 April 1994, revamped to follow the Los Angeles production, with a second official &quot;opening&quot;. The revamped musical had a new song, &quot;Every Movie&#x27;s a Circus&quot;, a new set, and new stars, Betty Buckley and John Barrowman. Anita Louise Combe took the role of Betty and, as a result of her performance, was invited to play the role in the original Canadian production in Toronto the following year. Michael Bauer, who had originally played DeMille, played Max, a role he played until the end of the London run and then on the UK tour and in the BBC concert. Buckley and the production garnered improved reviews. Elaine Paige, who had filled in when Buckley was ill in 1994 took over the part in May 1995. Petula Clark filled in for Paige in September/October 1995, before taking over the role in January 1996. The last new actress to play Norma in London was Rita Moreno, who had filled in for Clark in September and October 1996. Alexander Hanson took over Joe in 1995. Graham Bickley played Joe for the final year of the run. The show closed on 5 April 1997 after 1,530 performances.

===Los Angeles production===

The first American production opened at the Shubert Theatre in Century City, Los Angeles, California, on 9 December 1993, with Glenn Close as Norma and Alan Campbell as Joe. Featured were George Hearn as Max and Judy Kuhn as Betty. Lloyd Webber had reworked both the book and score, tightening the production, better organising the orchestrations, and adding the song &quot;Every Movie&#x27;s a Circus&quot;. This new production was better received by the critics than the premiere, and was an instant success, running for 369 performances. The production also recorded a new cast album that is well regarded. It is also the only first cast recording of the show, since the original London recording was trimmed by over thirty minutes.

Faye Dunaway was hired to replace Close and began rehearsals with Rex Smith as Joe and Jon Cypher as Max. Tickets went on sale for Dunaway&#x27;s engagement but shortly after rehearsals started, the producers announced that Dunaway was unable to sing the role to their standards; the production would shut down when Close left. Lloyd Webber&#x27;s spokesman stated: &quot;The cancellation came despite advance ticket sales for the Los Angeles production &#x27;way in excess of $4 million&quot;; Dunaway denied this. She filed a lawsuit claiming her reputation had been damaged by the producer&#x27;s claims. The producers paid her a settlement.

===Original Broadway production===
The musical opened on Broadway at the Minskoff Theatre on 17 November 1994 with Close, Campbell, and Hearn recreating their roles from the Los Angeles production and Alice Ripley joining the cast as Betty. Also in the cast were Alan Oppenheimer as Cecil B. DeMille and Vincent Tumeo as Artie Green. The production opened with the highest ticket sale advance in Broadway history to that time. It closed on 22 March 1997, after playing 977 performances. Billy Wilder was in attendance on opening night and was coaxed onstage by Close for the curtain call. In a season with only one other original musical nominated, the production won several Tony Awards, including Best Musical, Score and Book; Close, with only one other nominee as Best Actress in a musical, won the Tony for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Vincent Canby later commented about the Tony season: &quot;Awards don&#x27;t really tell you much when the competition is feeble or simply non-existent, as was the case the year that &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; won its Tony.&quot; During the run, Buckley replaced Close as Norma, followed by Paige.

LuPone, who initially had been promised the Broadway run, sued Lloyd Webber and received a settlement reported to be $1 million. Frank Rich, in his book &quot;The Hot Seat&quot;, noted that these lawsuits contributed to &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; setting the record for the most money lost by a theatrical endeavour in the history of the United States. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, operating costs soared far beyond the budget, and the &quot;Broadway production has earned back, at best, 80% of the initial $13 million&quot;. The paper reported that during the week of 2 July 1995, &quot;it cost $731,304 to run &quot;Sunset Boulevard,&quot; including ... advertising fees of $138,352 (which had been budgeted at $40,000 a week).&quot; The road companies also generated large financial losses. Rich puts the final figure near or above US$20 million lost, making the show what he termed a &quot;flop-hit&quot;, as it ran more than two years and the musical sold over a million tickets on Broadway.

===Touring productions===
The first national US tour in 1996 starring Linda Balgord ended in early 1997 after only a handful of venues due to exorbitant costs involved in transporting the set. Lloyd Webber called in director Susan H. Schulman to design a scaled-down production, with Petula Clark once again in the lead opposite Lewis Cleale as Joe. This production featured Anthony Powell&#x27;s Tony Award nominated costumes, a slightly modified libretto by Schulman and Don Black and a new, more tour-friendly set by Derek McLane. The revised production, opening in Pittsburgh about a year after the closing of the original tour in Chicago, went on the road for almost two years, though it avoided the cities covered by the previous tour.

In August 2001, a UK tour commenced in Plymouth starring Faith Brown as Norma, opposite Earl Carpenter as Joe, and Michael Bauer reprising his West End performance as Max. The production had a completely new set, much simpler than the original London set, although the overall production remained closer to the original staging than the revamped US national tour. Carpenter left midway through the tour and was replaced by Jeremy Finch, who had previously understudied the role. The tour finished in late 2002 in Manchester and met with both excellent reviews and respectable ticket sales.

Ria Jones, who originated the role of Norma Desmond in the 1991 Sydmonton Workshop and understudied Glenn Close in the 2016 London revival, led a new production opening at Leicester&#x27;s Curve Theatre on 16 September 2017 for a two-week run before embarking on a national tour around the United Kingdom. Starring opposite Jones as Norma was Danny Mac as Joe Gillis. The tour, directed by Curve artistic director Nikolai Foster, transferred the musical into a Hollywood sound stage setting, designed by Colin Richmond, with acclaimed use of vintage archive film and projections designed by Douglas O&#x27;Connell.
===West End and London revivals===
An eight-week engagement of a minimalist production, in which the actors used musical instruments, ran at the Watermill Theatre in Newbury over the summer of 2008. Directed and choreographed by Craig Revel Horwood, the cast featured Kathryn Evans as Norma Desmond and Ben Goddard as Joe Gillis. A West End transfer of the production began on 4 December 2008 prior to an official opening on 15 December at the Comedy Theatre, with Evans and Goddard reprising their roles, and Dave Willetts joining the cast as Max. The production received rave reviews. The production closed on 30 May 2009.

Opening on 4 April 2016, English National Opera (ENO) presented a five-week &#x27;semi-staged&#x27; production at the London Coliseum. Close reprised her role as Norma, making her London theatre debut, along with Michael Xavier as Joe, Siobhan Dillon as Betty and Fred Johanson as Max. Michael Linnit and Michael Grade for Gate Ventures PLC worked with ENO to present the show; Johnny Hon was the executive producer.

A revival opened at the Savoy Theatre in September 2023 for a 16-week limited run. Starring Nicole Scherzinger as Norma, the piece was reimagined in a modern and minimalist staging directed by Jamie Lloyd and produced by Lloyd Webber Harrison Musicals. Others in the cast were Tom Francis, David Thaxton, and Grace Hodgett Young (making her professional debut) starring as Joe, Max, and Betty, respectively. Rachel Tucker guest starred as Norma on 12 October 2023, and played on Monday evenings beginning 16 October. Changes to the score included cutting two songs and substantial lyric rewrites. &quot;Let&#x27;s Have Lunch&quot; became &quot;Let&#x27;s Do Lunch&quot;, and the &quot;Exit Music&quot; was more substantively incorporated into the show. The revival received eleven nominations at the 2024 Laurence Olivier Awards and won seven, the most for any production of the season, including Best Musical Revival, Best Actress and Actor in a Musical for Scherzinger and Francis, and Best Director for Lloyd. A cast album, recorded live at the Savoy Theatre, &quot;Sunset Blvd: The Album&quot;, was released on 25 October 2024.

===Broadway revivals===

Close reprised her performance as Norma Desmond in the first revival on Broadway. Featuring a 40-piece onstage orchestra and a relatively minimalist set, the production began performances at the Palace Theatre on 2 February 2017 before opening officially on 9 February for a limited run, with tickets on sale through 25 June 2017. The cast featured Michael Xavier as Joe Gillis, Siobhan Dillon as Betty Schaefer, and Fred Johanson as Max von Mayerling, all reprising their roles from the 2016 London ENO production. The 2017 Broadway revival was directed by Lonny Price.

The 2023 West End revival transferred to Broadway at the St. James Theatre, with previews beginning on 28 September 2024 and an opening night on 20 October. Scherzinger reprises her role as Norma, with West End co-stars Tom Francis as Joe, David Thaxton as Max, and Grace Hodgett Young as Betty. In a six-minute sequence at the start of the second act, Joe walks through the backstage area of the theater, exits onto West 44th Street and begins to sing &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;. As he sings, he continues down the street and through Shubert Alley, joined by the company shortly before returning to the theater at the end of the song. A LCD screen inside the theater shows the sequence. Mandy Gonzalez plays Norma Desmond at select performances once a week beginning 22 October. The 2024 Broadway revival is scheduled to close on 13 July 2025.

===International productions===
The original Canadian production opened in Toronto on 15 October 1995, with Diahann Carroll in the lead role. Her performance was praised by critics. It also starred Rex Smith as Joe, Walter Charles as Max and Anita Louise Combe, who had played Betty in the London production, repeating in this role. Toronto performances ended in August 1996, with the production later moving to Vancouver where it ran from November 1996 to March 1997. A highlights recording of this production was released on CD.

A German production of the musical opened 7 December 1995 at the newly built Rhein-Main Theater in Niedernhausen near Wiesbaden, starring Helen Schneider and Sue Mathys (matinees) as Norma and Uwe Kröger as Joe. A cast recording (with Schneider and Kröger) was released in 1996. The role of Norma was later played by Daniela Ziegler and Christina Grimandi, with Schneider and, for the last few months, Sue Mathys both returning to play the lead. The production closed in May 1998.

In October 1996, the original Australian production of the musical opened at Melbourne&#x27;s newly restored Regent Theatre. The cast included Debra Byrne as Norma, Hugh Jackman as Joe, and Catherine Porter as Betty. Maria Mercedes starred as the alternate Norma, performing two of the eight shows each week, eventually taking over the role as Norma. Amanda Harrison took over the role of Betty for the final months of the show&#x27;s run. The production ran until 14 June 1997.

A year-long Dutch tour commenced in the Netherlands on 10 October 2008, with Simone Kleinsma and Pia Douwes alternating as Norma and Antonie Kamerling as Joe, using the same modified libretto that was first used in the 2001 UK tour. Kleinsma went on to win the Best Actress Award for the role in the 2009 Dutch Musical Awards and also Best Actress at the Flemish Musical Prizes. An official cast album was released, with Kleinsma appearing on the main album and with a four track bonus CD of Pia Douwes singing Norma&#x27;s main arias.

The Swedish premiere took place at the Värmlandsoperan in September 2009, to mostly positive reviews. The role of Norma was played by Maria Lundqvist. A second much more elaborate production opened in October 2010, at the Gothenburg opera house, with Gunilla Backman (who previously understudied the role of Betty in the original German production) starring as Norma.

The first Danish production of &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; opened 2012 at NørregadeTeatret, Maribo, starring Karen-Lise Mynster as Norma.

The Czech production with Hana Fialová and Katarína Hasprová in the role of Norma had its premiere in National Moravian-Silesian Theatre in Ostrava. The premiere took place on 19 February 2015. The show closed in March 2017.

Another German production, starring Katharina Scherer as Norma, Philippe J. Kayser as Joe, Antonia Crames as Betty, and Stephan Vanecek as Max, opened to sold-out seats on 15 September 2017 and had its fourteenth and final performance on 8 October 2017 at the Tuchfabrik in Trier.

The Spanish premiere production opened 27 December 2017 at the Auditorio de Tenerife, directed by Jaime Azpilicueta and starring Paloma San Basilio as Norma Desmond, Gerónimo Rauch as Joe Gillis, Inma Mira as Betty Schaefer, and Gonzalo Montes as Max von Mayerling.

Another Danish production by Den Jyske Opera opened 12 August 2022 at Musikhuset Aarhus, directed by Philipp Kochheim and starring Tammi Øst as Norma, Randy Diamond as Joe, Katharina Maria Abt as Betty, and Martin Loft as Max. The production received mixed reviews from critics who praised the performances of Øst and the Aarhus Symphony Orchestra while criticizing the direction and the casting of Diamond as Joe due to his advanced age.

Sarah Brightman starred as Norma Desmond in a production that opened in Melbourne on 21 May 2024, at the Princess Theatre with an official opening night on 29 May. This was followed by an engagement at the Sydney Opera House beginning 28 August. This is Brightman&#x27;s first theatrical role in more than three decades. The cast included Silvie Paladino as Norma sharing the role with Brightman , Tim Draxl as Joe and Robert Grubb as Max. Brightman was unable to perform due to a calf injury from 9 June until her return on 3 July. Paladino performed the role in this period. This new production is directed by Paul Warwick Griffin with set and costume design by Morgan Large, choreography by Ashley Wallen, and musical supervision by Kristen Blodgette. The production transferred to Singapore in February 2025 at Singapore&#x27;s Sands Theatre at the Marina Bay Sands.

===Other productions===
In 2004, the first regional production of &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; was staged in the round at the Marriott Theatre in Chicago for a limited period and starred Paula Scrofano as Norma. It was the first and only regional production to be licensed by the Really Useful Group (RUG) for the next six years. However, in the spring of 2010, the leasing rights were finally released to regional companies and numerous productions have been staged around the United States.

The Ogunquit Playhouse production ran from 28 July through 14 August 2010 and starred Stefanie Powers as Norma and Todd Gearhart as Joe. This was the first fully staged production in the U.S. in nearly a decade.

The Arvada Center production ran from 14 September to 10 October 2010, in Denver, Colorado, the same city that launched the ill-fated first US tour in 1996. The show starred Ann Crumb as Norma and Kevin Earley as Joe. The production was directed by Rod A. Landsberry.

The Kennedy Center production ran from 1–8 February 2023 in Washington, D.C., with Stephanie J. Block starring as Norma, Derek Klena as Joe, Nathan Gunn as Max and Auli&#x27;i Cravalho as Betty. The show ran as a limited engagement as part of the Kennedy Center&#x27;s Broadway Center Stage series.

Produced by Alpha, the concert was a fully staged production with direction by Jordan Murphy, choreography by Joanna Goodwin, and conducted by Alex Parker. Karimloo, Murray, Strallen, and Secomb reprised their performances.

==Film adaptation==
Paramount Pictures and the Relevant Picture Company announced in 2005 that they were developing a film adaptation of the musical. In 2007, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that actresses considered for the role of Norma Desmond included Close, Paige, Meryl Streep, Liza Minnelli, and Barbra Streisand. In a 2008 interview, Andrew Lloyd Webber said that there were no plans for a film adaptation to be made in the near future, but remained hopeful that one would be made at some point. In 2011, Lloyd Webber indicated that he would have wanted Madonna to star in the film.

In a 2013 interview with Elaine Paige during her BBC Radio 2 show &quot;Elaine Paige on Sunday&quot;, Lloyd Webber was asked about the progress of the film, to which he replied:

In February 2019, it was announced that Rob Ashford had signed on to direct the film, with Close reprising her role as Norma Desmond and Tom MacRae penning the script, with production slated to begin on October of that year, but was then delayed to the fall of 2020. In an October 2020 interview, Close, along with her confirmation of co-producing the film alongside Lloyd Webber, said that she hoped filming would commence in early 2021, citing the COVID-19 pandemic as the reason for the delay. In May 2021, Close stated in an interview that production was &quot;very, very close&quot; to beginning and that they were &quot;ready to go&quot;, while also adding that Lloyd Webber was still working on new music for the film. However, in October 2021, Lloyd Webber announced that production had been stalled, stating, &quot;I wish I could say it&#x27;s going into production tomorrow morning, but it&#x27;s not. Paramount has not wanted to go ahead with it. It&#x27;s not for want of trying. Glenn Close has been absolutely doggedly trying to get it made.&quot; On 2 May 2022, at the 2022 Met Gala, Close revealed that &quot;We&#x27;re getting closer, believe it or not. We&#x27;re getting closer,&quot; without disclosing any additional information.

In May 2024, during &quot;Variety&quot;″s 2024 Power of Women luncheon, Close revealed that the film is still moving forward, but with Ashford no longer attached as director. She went on to remark on how the character of Norma Desmond still resonates in modern times, saying &quot;That character of Norma is so heartbreakingly beautiful and will never not have relevance, it&#x27;s been a great blessing to play her and I&#x27;m not willing to let her go yet without one more tribute.&quot;

<doc id="663039" wikidata="Q232997" url="?curid=663039" title="Two-phase flow">
<text>In fluid mechanics, two-phase flow is a flow of gas and liquid — a particular example of multiphase flow. Two-phase flow can occur in various forms, such as flows transitioning from pure liquid to vapor as a result of external heating, separated flows, and dispersed two-phase flows where one phase is present in the form of particles, droplets, or bubbles in a continuous carrier phase (i.e. gas or liquid).

==Categorization==
The widely accepted method to categorize two-phase flows is to consider the velocity of each phase as if there is not other phases available. The parameter is a hypothetical concept called Superficial velocity.

== Examples and applications ==
Historically, probably the most commonly studied cases of two-phase flow are in large-scale power systems. Coal and gas-fired power stations used very large boilers to produce steam for use in turbines. In such cases, pressurised water is passed through heated pipes and it changes to steam as it moves through the pipe. The design of boilers requires a detailed understanding of two-phase flow heat-transfer and pressure drop behaviour, which is significantly different from the single-phase case. Even more critically, nuclear reactors use water to remove heat from the reactor core using two-phase flow. A great deal of study has been performed on the nature of two-phase flow in such cases, so that engineers can design against possible failures in pipework, loss of pressure, and so on (a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA)).

Another case where two-phase flow can occur is in pump cavitation. Here a pump is operating close to the vapor pressure of the fluid being pumped. If pressure drops further, which can happen locally near the vanes for the pump, for example, then a phase change can occur and gas will be present in the pump. Similar effects can also occur on marine propellers; wherever it occurs, it is a serious problem for designers. When the vapor bubble collapses, it can produce very large pressure spikes, which over time will cause damage on the propeller or turbine.

The above two-phase flow cases are for a single fluid occurring by itself as two different phases, such as steam and water. The term &#x27;two-phase flow&#x27; is also applied to mixtures of different fluids having different phases, such as air and water, or oil and natural gas. Sometimes even &quot;three&quot;-phase flow is considered, such as in oil and gas pipelines where there might be a significant fraction of solids. Although oil and water are not strictly distinct phases (since they are both liquids) they are sometimes considered as a two-phase flow; and the combination of oil, gas and water (e.g. the flow from an offshore oil well) may also be considered a three-phase flow.

Other interesting areas where two-phase flow is studied includes water electrolysis, climate systems such as clouds, and in groundwater flow, in which the movement of water and air through the soil is studied.

Other examples of two-phase flow include bubbles, rain, waves on the sea, foam, fountains, mousse, cryogenics, and oil slicks. One final example is in the electrical explosion of metal.

== Characteristics of two-phase flow ==
Several features make two-phase flow an interesting and challenging branch of fluid mechanics:

*Surface tension makes all dynamical problems nonlinear (see Weber number)
*In the case of air and water at standard temperature and pressure, the density of the two phases differs by a factor of about 1000. Similar differences are typical of water liquid/water vapor densities
*The sound speed changes dramatically for materials undergoing phase change, and can be orders of magnitude different. This introduces compressible effects into the problem
*The phase changes are not instantaneous, and the liquid vapor system will not necessarily be in phase equilibrium
*The change of phase means flow-induced pressure drops can cause further phase-change (e.g. water can evaporate through a valve) increasing the relative volume of the gaseous, compressible medium and increasing exit velocities, unlike single-phase incompressible flow where closing a valve would decrease exit velocities
*Can give rise to other counter-intuitive, negative resistance-type instabilities, like Ledinegg instability, geysering, chugging, relaxation instability, and flow maldistribution instabilities as examples of &quot;static&quot; instabilities, and other &quot;dynamic&quot; instabilities
Additional exhaustive information, like applied mathematical models can be found in. 

==Acoustics==

Gurgling is a characteristic sound made by unstable two-phase fluid flow, for example, as liquid is poured from a bottle, or during gargling.

Modelling of two phase flow is still under development. Known methods are
*Volume of fluid method
*Level-set method
*Front tracking by Gretar Tryggvason
*Lattice Boltzmann methods
*Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH)

<doc id="663041" wikidata="Q1196892" url="?curid=663041" title="Greatest element and least element">
<text>In mathematics, especially in order theory, the greatest element of a subset formula_1 of a partially ordered set (poset) is an element of formula_1 that is greater than every other element of formula_1. The term least element is defined dually, that is, it is an element of formula_1 that is smaller than every other element of formula_5

== Definitions ==

Let formula_6 be a preordered set and let formula_7 
An element formula_8 is said to be if formula_9 and if it also satisfies: 
:formula_10 for all formula_11

By switching the side of the relation that formula_12 is on in the above definition, the definition of a least element of formula_1 is obtained. Explicitly, an element formula_14 is said to be if formula_15 and if it also satisfies: 
:formula_16 for all formula_11 

If formula_6 is also a partially ordered set then formula_1 can have at most one greatest element and it can have at most one least element. Whenever a greatest element of formula_1 exists and is unique then this element is called greatest element of formula_1. The terminology least element of formula_1 is defined similarly. 

If formula_6 has a greatest element (resp. a least element) then this element is also called (resp. ) of formula_24 

=== Relationship to upper/lower bounds ===

Greatest elements are closely related to upper bounds. 

Let formula_6 be a preordered set and let formula_7 
An is an element formula_27 such that formula_28 and formula_29 for all formula_11 Importantly, an upper bound of formula_1 in formula_32 is required to be an element of formula_5 

If formula_8 then formula_35 is a greatest element of formula_1 if and only if formula_35 is an upper bound of formula_1 in formula_6 formula_40 In particular, any greatest element of formula_1 is also an upper bound of formula_1 (in formula_32) but an upper bound of formula_1 in formula_32 is a greatest element of formula_1 if and only if it to formula_5 
In the particular case where formula_48 the definition of &quot;formula_27 is an upper bound of formula_1 &quot; becomes: formula_27 is an element such that formula_52 and formula_29 for all formula_54 which is to the definition of a greatest element given before. 
Thus formula_35 is a greatest element of formula_1 if and only if formula_35 is an upper bound of formula_1 . 

If formula_27 is an upper bound of formula_1 that is not an upper bound of formula_1 (which can happen if and only if formula_62) then formula_27 can be a greatest element of formula_1 (however, it may be possible that some other element a greatest element of formula_1). 
In particular, it is possible for formula_1 to simultaneously have a greatest element for there to exist some upper bound of formula_1 . 

Even if a set has some upper bounds, it need not have a greatest element, as shown by the example of the negative real numbers. 
This example also demonstrates that the existence of a least upper bound (the number 0 in this case) does not imply the existence of a greatest element either.

=== Contrast to maximal elements and local/absolute maximums ===
A greatest element of a subset of a preordered set should not be confused with a maximal element of the set, which are elements that are not strictly smaller than any other element in the set. 

Let formula_6 be a preordered set and let formula_7 
An element formula_70 is said to be a if the following condition is satisfied:

:whenever formula_71 satisfies formula_72 then necessarily formula_73 

If formula_6 is a partially ordered set then formula_70 is a maximal element of formula_1 if and only if there does exist any formula_71 such that formula_78 and formula_79 
A is defined to mean a maximal element of the subset formula_80 

A set can have several maximal elements without having a greatest element. 
Like upper bounds and maximal elements, greatest elements may fail to exist. 

In a totally ordered set the maximal element and the greatest element coincide; and it is also called maximum; in the case of function values it is also called the absolute maximum, to avoid confusion with a local maximum. 
The dual terms are minimum and absolute minimum. 
Together they are called the absolute extrema. 
Similar conclusions hold for least elements.

;Role of (in)comparability in distinguishing greatest vs. maximal elements

One of the most important differences between a greatest element formula_35 and a maximal element formula_82 of a preordered set formula_6 has to do with what elements they are comparable to. 
Two elements formula_84 are said to be if formula_85 or formula_86; they are called if they are not comparable. 
Because preorders are reflexive (which means that formula_87 is true for all elements formula_88), every element formula_88 is always comparable to itself. 
Consequently, the only pairs of elements that could possibly be incomparable are pairs. 
In general, however, preordered sets (and even directed partially ordered sets) may have elements that are incomparable. 

By definition, an element formula_8 is a greatest element of formula_6 if formula_92 for every formula_93; so by its very definition, a greatest element of formula_6 must, in particular, be comparable to element in formula_95 
This is not required of maximal elements. 
Maximal elements of formula_6 are required to be comparable to every element in formula_95 
This is because unlike the definition of &quot;greatest element&quot;, the definition of &quot;maximal element&quot; includes an important statement. 
The defining condition for formula_98 to be a maximal element of formula_6 can be reworded as: 

:For all formula_100 formula_78 (so elements that are incomparable to formula_82 are ignored) then formula_73 

;Example where all elements are maximal but none are greatest

Suppose that formula_1 is a set containing (distinct) elements and define a partial order formula_105 on formula_1 by declaring that formula_107 if and only if formula_108 
If formula_109 belong to formula_1 then neither formula_107 nor formula_112 holds, which shows that all pairs of distinct (i.e. non-equal) elements in formula_1 are comparable. 
Consequently, formula_114 can not possibly have a greatest element (because a greatest element of formula_1 would, in particular, have to be comparable to element of formula_1 but formula_1 has no such element). 
However, element formula_70 is a maximal element of formula_114 because there is exactly one element in formula_1 that is both comparable to formula_82 and formula_122 that element being formula_82 itself (which of course, is formula_124).

In contrast, if a preordered set formula_6 does happen to have a greatest element formula_35 then formula_35 will necessarily be a maximal element of formula_6 and moreover, as a consequence of the greatest element formula_35 being comparable to element of formula_130 if formula_6 is also partially ordered then it is possible to conclude that formula_35 is the maximal element of formula_24 
However, the uniqueness conclusion is no longer guaranteed if the preordered set formula_6 is also partially ordered. 
For example, suppose that formula_135 is a non-empty set and define a preorder formula_105 on formula_135 by declaring that formula_107 holds for all formula_139 The directed preordered set formula_140 is partially ordered if and only if formula_135 has exactly one element. All pairs of elements from formula_135 are comparable and element of formula_135 is a greatest element (and thus also a maximal element) of formula_144 So in particular, if formula_135 has at least two elements then formula_140 has multiple greatest elements.

== Properties ==

Throughout, let formula_6 be a partially ordered set and let formula_7 
* A set formula_1 can have at most greatest element. Thus if a set has a greatest element then it is necessarily unique.
* If it exists, then the greatest element of formula_1 is an upper bound of formula_1 that is also contained in formula_5 
* If formula_35 is the greatest element of formula_1 then formula_35 is also a maximal element of formula_1 and moreover, any other maximal element of formula_1 will necessarily be equal to formula_158
** Thus if a set formula_1 has several maximal elements then it cannot have a greatest element.
* If formula_32 satisfies the ascending chain condition, a subset formula_1 of formula_32 has a greatest element if, and only if, it has one maximal element.
* When the restriction of formula_105 to formula_1 is a total order (formula_165 in the topmost picture is an example), then the notions of maximal element and greatest element coincide. 
** However, this is not a necessary condition for whenever formula_1 has a greatest element, the notions coincide, too, as stated above. 
* If the notions of maximal element and greatest element coincide on every two-element subset formula_1 of formula_130 then formula_105 is a total order on formula_95

== Sufficient conditions ==
* A finite chain always has a greatest and a least element.

== Top and bottom ==

The least and greatest element of the whole partially ordered set play a special role and are also called bottom (⊥) and top (⊤), or zero (0) and unit (1), respectively.
If both exist, the poset is called a bounded poset.
The notation of 0 and 1 is used preferably when the poset is a complemented lattice, and when no confusion is likely, i.e. when one is not talking about partial orders of numbers that already contain elements 0 and 1 different from bottom and top.
The existence of least and greatest elements is a special completeness property of a partial order.

Further introductory information is found in the article on order theory.

== Examples ==
* The subset of integers has no upper bound in the set formula_171 of real numbers.
* Let the relation formula_105 on formula_173 be given by formula_174 formula_175 formula_176 formula_177 The set formula_178 has upper bounds formula_179 and formula_180 but no least upper bound, and no greatest element (cf. picture).
* In the rational numbers, the set of numbers with their square less than 2 has upper bounds but no greatest element and no least upper bound.
* In formula_181 the set of numbers less than 1 has a least upper bound, viz. 1, but no greatest element.
* In formula_181 the set of numbers less than or equal to 1 has a greatest element, viz. 1, which is also its least upper bound.
* In formula_183 with the product order, the set of pairs formula_184 with formula_185 has no upper bound.
* In formula_183 with the lexicographical order, this set has upper bounds, e.g. formula_187 It has no least upper bound.

* Initial and terminal objects

<text>Vincent Patrick Deighan (born 1968), better known by the pen name Frank Quitely, is a Scottish comic book artist. He is best known for his frequent collaborations with Grant Morrison on titles such as &quot;New X-Men&quot;, &quot;We3&quot;, &quot;All-Star Superman&quot;, and &quot;Batman and Robin&quot;, as well as his work with Mark Millar on &quot;The Authority&quot; and &quot;Jupiter&#x27;s Legacy&quot;.

==Early life==
Deighan was raised in Rutherglen, although attended St. Bride&#x27;s High School in East Kilbride (as his father worked there as a PE teacher). He studied drawing at the Glasgow School of Art.

==Career==
Deighan worked up the Scottish underground comics title &quot;Electric Soup&quot; in 1990, writing and drawing &quot;The Greens&quot;, a parody of &quot;The Broons&quot; strip published by D. C. Thomson. It was in working on this book that he adopted the pseudonym of &quot;Frank Quitely&quot; (a spoonerism of &quot;quite frankly&quot;), as he did not want his family to know it was his work, worried that they may have found it upsetting.

Initially &quot;Electric Soup&quot; was only distributed locally in Glasgow, then it was picked up by John Brown Publishing for widespread national UK distribution. This brought Quitely&#x27;s work to the attention of &quot;Judge Dredd Megazine&quot; editor David Bishop. He was given work on &quot;Shimura&quot;, written by Robbie Morrison, and &quot;Missionary Man&quot;, by Gordon Rennie, quickly rising to prominence. He drew various stories in Paradox Press&#x27; series of &quot;The Big Book Of&quot; graphic novels, as well as work in &quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot; for Dark Horse Comics.

His first major work in American comics was &quot;Flex Mentallo&quot; in 1996, a &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; spin-off written by fellow Glaswegian Grant Morrison for DC Comics&#x27; Vertigo imprint. Initially he worked on strips for anthology titles such as &quot;Weird War Tales&quot;, and drew three issues of Jamie Delano&#x27;s &quot;2020 Visions&quot;, as well as various covers for DC. He later drew his first full length graphic novel, &quot;Batman: The Scottish Connection&quot;, with writer Alan Grant in which The Greens make a cameo appearance. Quitely and Grant worked on a one-shot titled &quot;Lobo: The Hand-to-Hand Job&quot; later retitled as &quot;It&#x27;s a Man&#x27;s World&quot;. Although Quitely did all the pencils, the story was not released.

2000 saw Quitely and Morrison collaborate again, on &quot;&quot;. The graphic novel was met with positive critical response, and later that year Quitely took over from Bryan Hitch as artist on &quot;The Authority&quot;, with Mark Millar as writer.
Quitely left &quot;The Authority&quot; to draw &quot;New X-Men&quot;. Quitely illustrated a Destiny story for Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Sandman: Endless Nights&quot; hardcover graphic novel in 2003. After leaving &quot;New X-Men&quot;, Quitely drew the mini-series &quot;We3&quot; in 2004, again in collaboration with Morrison. He shared the 2005 Best Penciller/Inker or Penciller/Inker Team Eisner Award in a tie with artist John Cassaday for his work on the book. That same year, he and Morrison were nominated for Best Limited Series for that book, and Quitely additionally was nominated for the Best Cover Artist Eisner for both &quot;We3&quot; and &quot;Bite Club&quot;. He wrote and drew new instalments of &quot;The Greens&quot; for the Scottish underground comic &quot;Northern Lightz&quot;, and in 2005 Morrison and Quitely designed a series of tarot cards for &quot;Intensive Care&quot;, an album by popstar Robbie Williams.

In December 2004, Quitely signed to a two-year exclusive contract with DC Comics, where he illustrated &quot;All-Star Superman&quot;. The twelve issue series, yet another collaboration with Morrison, began publication in November 2005. Quitely and Morrison&#x27;s work on the series won them the Eisner Award for Best New Series in 2006, with Quitely collecting another nomination for Best Penciller/Inker. The series won Best Continuing Series in 2007 and 2009. In 2008 Quitely illustrated the cover for the debut issue of Scottish underground comic &quot;Wasted&quot;.

In early 2009, Frank Quitely collaborated with the Scottish rock band The Phantom Band in designing artwork for a limited edition 7&quot; single for their song &quot;The Howling&quot;, which plays on Quitely&#x27;s interest in occultism and esoterica. This was released as a limited run collector&#x27;s pressing by Glasgow&#x27;s Chemikal Underground Records. That same year, Quitely again teamed with Morrison, illustrated the first three issues of &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; title, which debuted in June 2009 after the &quot;&quot; storyline. He provided covers through issue No. 16. Quitely was one of the artists of &quot;Batman&quot; No. 700 (Aug. 2010).

On 9 April 2011, Quitely was one of 62 comics creators who appeared at the IGN stage at the Kapow! convention in London to set two Guinness World Records, the &quot;Fastest Production of a Comic Book&quot; and &quot;Most Contributors to a Comic Book&quot;. With Guinness officials on hand to monitor their progress, writer Mark Millar began work at 9 AM scripting a 20-page black and white &quot;Superior&quot; comic book, with Quitely and the other artists appearing on stage throughout the day to work on the pencils, inks, and lettering, including Dave Gibbons, John Romita Jr., Jock, Adi Granov, Doug Braithwaite, Ian Churchill, Olivier Coipel, Duncan Fegredo, Simon Furman, David Lafuente, John McCrea, Sean Phillips and Liam Sharp, who all drew a panel each, with regular &quot;Superior&quot; artist Leinil Yu creating the book&#x27;s front cover. The book was completed in 11 hours, 19 minutes, and 38 seconds, and was published through Icon on 23 November 2011, with all royalties being donated to Yorkhill Children&#x27;s Foundation.

That same month, he mentioned during a panel at WonderCon that although he had split his time equally between illustrating covers and interiors, he had recently been devoting more of his time to covers, due to back problems, and the difficulty that presented in meeting his deadlines.

In 2012, Quitely was one of several artists to illustrate a variant cover for Robert Kirkman&#x27;s &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; No. 100, which was released on 11 July at San Diego Comic-Con.

Quitely was the artist on &quot;Jupiter&#x27;s Legacy&quot;, a ten-issue, creator-owned miniseries published by Image Comics that premiered in September 2012. It is written by Mark Millar, who described the project as &quot;his Star Wars&quot;, and a cross between &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and a large-scale superhero crossover, albeit one that did not require the in-depth knowledge normally required of such stories, as it features entirely new characters. On July 17, 2018, it was announced that Netflix had given a series order for a television adaptation of &quot;Jupiter&#x27;s Legacy&quot;.

Quitely drew the fourth issue of Grant Morrison&#x27;s &quot;The Multiversity&quot; limited series which was published in November 2014.

In March 2017, an exhibition of his work was displayed at Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow. A few months later, Quitely received an honorary degree as a Doctor of Letters from the University of Glasgow in recognition of his achievements.

==Personal life==
Quitely married his high school sweetheart, Ann Jane Docherty, in 1994. They live in Rutherglen with their sons Vincent and Joseph, and their daughter, Orla. Quitely&#x27;s son Vincent is also an artist who created art for local in 2011 while a pupil at Trinity High School.

Quitely used to design his own hats and clothing. For a long time, he eschewed social media, noting that the Twitter account @Frank_Quitely is unconnected with him. In 2021, Quitely established official accounts on both Twitter and Instagram.

==Technique and materials==
In a 2014 BBC News interview, Deighan, having developed a reputation for difficulty in meeting deadlines, stated while he did his drawing digitally, it did not reduce the time it took to complete his art, saying, &quot;I have never been on a project where I&#x27;ve thought &#x27;ach, this is rubbish&#x27;, and not tried hard,&quot; he says, &quot;It&#x27;s not in my nature. The downside of that is that things take a while.&quot;

<text>In computational complexity theory, the Cook–Levin theorem, also known as Cook&#x27;s theorem, states that the Boolean satisfiability problem is NP-complete. That is, it is in NP, and any problem in NP can be reduced in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine to the Boolean satisfiability problem.

The theorem is named after Stephen Cook and Leonid Levin. The proof is due to Richard Karp, based on an earlier proof (using a different notion of reducibility) by Cook.

An important consequence of this theorem is that if there exists a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for solving Boolean satisfiability, then every NP problem can be solved by a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm. The question of whether such an algorithm for Boolean satisfiability exists is thus equivalent to the P versus NP problem, which is still widely considered the most important unsolved problem in theoretical computer science.

==Contributions==
The concept of NP-completeness was developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s in parallel by researchers in North America and the Soviet Union.
In 1971, Stephen Cook published his paper &quot;The complexity of theorem proving procedures&quot; in conference proceedings of the newly founded ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing. Richard Karp&#x27;s subsequent paper, &quot;Reducibility among
combinatorial problems&quot;, generated renewed interest in Cook&#x27;s paper by providing a list of 21 NP-complete problems. Karp also introduced the notion of completeness used in the current definition of NP-completeness (i.e., by polynomial-time many-one reduction). Cook and Karp each received a Turing Award for this work.
The theoretical interest in NP-completeness was also enhanced by the work of Theodore P. Baker, John Gill, and Robert Solovay who showed, in 1975, that solving NP-problems in certain oracle machine models requires exponential time. That is, there exists an oracle &quot;A&quot; such that, for all subexponential deterministic-time complexity classes T, the relativized complexity class NP&quot;A&quot; is not a subset of T&quot;A&quot;. In particular, for this oracle, P&quot;A&quot; ≠ NP&quot;A&quot;.

In the USSR, a result equivalent to Baker, Gill, and Solovay&#x27;s was published in 1969 by M. Dekhtiar. Later Leonid Levin&#x27;s paper, &quot;Universal search problems&quot;, was published in 1973, although it was mentioned in talks and submitted for publication a few years earlier.

Levin&#x27;s approach was slightly different from Cook&#x27;s and Karp&#x27;s in that he considered search problems, which require finding solutions rather than simply determining existence. He provided six such NP-complete search problems, or &quot;universal problems&quot;.
Additionally he found for each of these problems an algorithm that solves it in optimal time (in particular, these algorithms run in polynomial time if and only if P = NP).

==Definitions==
A decision problem is &quot;in NP&quot; if it can be decided by a non-deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time.

An &quot;instance of the Boolean satisfiability problem&quot; is a Boolean expression that combines Boolean variables using Boolean operators.
Such an expression is &quot;satisfiable&quot; if there is some assignment of truth values to the variables that makes the entire expression true.

==Idea==
Given any decision problem in NP, construct a non-deterministic machine that solves it in polynomial time. Then for each input to that machine, build a Boolean expression that computes whether when that specific input is passed to the machine, the machine runs correctly, and the machine halts and answers &quot;yes&quot;. Then the expression can be satisfied if and only if there is a way for the machine to run correctly and answer &quot;yes&quot;, so the satisfiability of the constructed expression is equivalent to asking whether or not the machine will answer &quot;yes&quot;.

==Proof==
&quot;This proof is based on the one given by .&quot;

There are two parts to proving that the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is NP-complete. One is to show that SAT is an NP problem. The other is to show that every NP problem can be reduced to an instance of a SAT problem by a polynomial-time many-one reduction.

SAT is in NP because any assignment of Boolean values to Boolean variables that is claimed to satisfy the given expression can be &quot;verified&quot; in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine. (The statements verifiable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine&quot; and solvable in polynomial time by a non-deterministic Turing machine&quot; are equivalent, and the proof can be found in many textbooks, for example Sipser&#x27;s &quot;Introduction to the Theory of Computation&quot;, section 7.3., as well as in the Wikipedia article on NP).

Now suppose that a given problem in NP can be solved by the nondeterministic Turing machine formula_1, where formula_2 is the set of states, formula_3 is the alphabet of tape symbols, formula_4 is the initial state, formula_5 is the set of accepting states, and formula_6 is the transition relation. Suppose further that formula_7 accepts or rejects an instance of the problem after at most formula_8 computation steps, where formula_9 is the size of the instance and formula_10 is a polynomial function.

For each input, formula_11, specify a Boolean expression formula_12 that is satisfiable if and only if the machine formula_7 accepts formula_11.

The Boolean expression uses the variables set out in the following table. Here, formula_15 is a machine state, formula_16 is a tape position, formula_17 is a tape symbol, and formula_18 is the number of a computation step.

Define the Boolean expression formula_12 to be the conjunction of the sub-expressions in the following table, for all formula_16 and formula_18:

If there is an accepting computation for formula_7 on input formula_11, then formula_12 is satisfiable by assigning formula_25, formula_26 and formula_27 their intended interpretations. On the other hand, if formula_12 is satisfiable, then there is an accepting computation for formula_7 on input formula_11 that follows the steps indicated by the assignments to the variables.

There are formula_31 Boolean variables, each encodable in space formula_32. The number of clauses is formula_33 so the size of formula_12 is formula_35. Thus the transformation is certainly a polynomial-time many-one reduction, as required.

Only the first table row (formula_36) actually depends on the input string formula_11. The remaining lines depend only on the input length formula_9 and on the machine formula_7; they formalize a generic computation of formula_7 for up to formula_8 steps.

The transformation makes extensive use of the polynomial formula_8. As a consequence, the above proof is not constructive: even if formula_7 is known, witnessing the membership of the given problem in NP, the transformation cannot be effectively computed, unless an upper bound formula_8 of formula_7&#x27;s time complexity is also known.

==Complexity==
While the above method encodes a non-deterministic Turing machine in complexity formula_46, the literature describes more sophisticated approaches in complexity formula_47. The quasilinear result first appeared seven years after Cook&#x27;s original publication.

The use of SAT to prove the existence of an NP-complete problem can be extended to other computational problems in logic, and to completeness for other complexity classes.
The quantified Boolean formula problem (QBF) involves Boolean formulas extended to include nested universal quantifiers and existential quantifiers for its variables. The QBF problem can be used to encode computation with a Turing machine limited to polynomial space complexity, proving that there exists a problem (the recognition of true quantified Boolean formulas) that is PSPACE-complete. Analogously, dependency quantified boolean formulas encode computation with a Turing machine limited to logarithmic space complexity, proving that there exists a problem that is NL-complete.

==Consequences==
The proof shows that every problem in NP can be reduced in polynomial time (in fact, logarithmic space suffices) to an instance of the Boolean satisfiability problem. This means that if the Boolean satisfiability problem could be solved in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine, then all problems in NP could be solved in polynomial time, and so the complexity class NP would be equal to the complexity class P.

The significance of NP-completeness was made clear by the publication in 1972 of Richard Karp&#x27;s landmark paper, &quot;Reducibility among combinatorial problems&quot;, in which he showed that 21 diverse combinatorial and graph theoretical problems, each infamous for its intractability, are NP-complete.

Karp showed each of his problems to be NP-complete by reducing another problem (already shown to be NP-complete) to that problem. For example, he showed the problem 3SAT (the Boolean satisfiability problem for expressions in conjunctive normal form (CNF) with exactly three variables or negations of variables per clause) to be NP-complete by showing how to reduce (in polynomial time) any instance of SAT to an equivalent instance of 3SAT.

Garey and Johnson presented more than 300 NP-complete problems in their book &quot;Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness&quot;, and new problems are still being discovered to be within that complexity class.

Although many practical instances of SAT can be solved by heuristic methods, the question of whether there is a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for SAT (and consequently all other NP-complete problems) is still a famous unsolved problem, despite decades of intense effort by complexity theorists, mathematical logicians, and others. For more details, see the article P versus NP problem.

<text>Earthlight is a science fiction novel by British writer Arthur C. Clarke, published in 1955. It is an expansion to novel length of a novella of the same name that he had published four years earlier.

==Overview==

&quot;Earthlight&quot; is a science fiction adventure story set on the Moon, where a government agent is looking for a suspected spy at a major observatory on the Moon. The context is strong tension between Earth (which controls the Moon) and independent settlers elsewhere in the Solar System. The year is not given, but it is some time in the 22nd century. There have been no wars for the last 200 years.

Events are low-key: the government agent is a mild-mannered accountant who does not like the task. He notices the beauty of the Moon under &#x27;earthlight&#x27;; the Earth in the sky far bigger than the Moon in the skies of Earth.

The story proceeds with very few violent incidents, though it does climax in a space battle. There is also an enigma - the apparent sighting of a &#x27;beam of light&#x27;, that should not be possible on the airless world. This is explained later in the story as a weapons beam that included metal particulates moving at high velocity.

Even though many of Clarke&#x27;s science fiction novels take place in rather similar futures—&quot;Earthlight&quot;, &quot;A Fall of Moondust&quot;, &quot;The Sands of Mars&quot;, &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;—the human background is never quite the same and they do not form a series.

==Plot summary==

The plot describes how political tension between the government of a politically united Earth (which maintains sovereignty over the Moon) and independent settlers and traders elsewhere in the Solar System who have formed a federation, erupts into warfare over the terms for the availability to the Federation of scarce heavy metals.

The trigger for hostilities is the publication of a research paper suggesting that the Moon may have previously unsuspected heavy metal resources which Earth proposes to monopolise. The Earth government&#x27;s intelligence agency suspects that confidential information concerning the exploitation of these mineral riches may be being leaked to the Federation and presses an accountant, Bertram Sadler, into service. Sadler is sent to the Moon&#x27;s main astronomical observatory located near the crater of Plato as a tip off has suggested that information is being routed through that location. Sadler&#x27;s cover story is that he is carrying out an investigation of waste in government spending.

The rising political tension is accompanied by the observatory staff enjoying the good fortune of observing a nearby supernova explosion in the constellation of Draco.

Despite a relatively long preceding era of peace, Earth and the Federation each prepare technologically for war. The Federation develops a new method of spacedrive propulsion while Earth develops new shielding technology and a weapon which uses an electromagnet-propelled bayonet of liquid metal. (The weapon mistaken for a beam of light).

A climactic battle between three Federation cruisers and the fortified mining installation (&quot;Project Thor&quot;) is played out near Mount Pico close to the lunar observatory. Two astronomers who have delivered a top Earth scientist to Pico with only a couple of hours to spare, witness the battle. Sadler, whose investigations have had no pay off except for the unmasking of an embezzling store manager, relinquishes his cover by going to debrief the two astronomers.

Of the three Federal cruisers, two are destroyed along with the mine in the battle. The third cruiser, named &quot;The Acheron&quot;, is terminally damaged and retreats towards Mars, but has little chance of reaching it before her nuclear reactor explodes. However, her new drive gives her the capability of a rendezvous with a passenger liner, &quot;The Pegasus&quot;, which is able to rescue all but one of the crew who have to make the 40 second crossing without space suits.

This inconclusive duel between mother planet and formerly dependent colonists, with each side suffering stiffer resistance than anticipated, discredits the governments on both sides. Sadler is able to return to civilian life but suffers nagging frustration that he never found out whether the spy that he was searching for existed or not. Many years later the commander of the &quot;Acheron&quot; writes his memoirs and reveals that information had reached the Federation from &quot;One of Earth&#x27;s most distinguished astronomers, now living in honoured retirement on the Moon&quot;. With this hint, Sadler is able to confirm the spy&#x27;s identity as Robert Molton, the first one of the observatory staff to greet him on his way to the observatory. The novel concludes with Molton enlightening Sadler and the reader as to the &quot;brilliant technical subterfuge&quot; with which he transmitted information, namely that he used the observatory&#x27;s main telescope as a transmitter by placing a modulated ultra-violet source at its prime focus. The signal was received by a Federation spaceship a few million kilometers away.

==Reception==
Groff Conklin characterized &quot;Earthlight&quot; as &quot;a fairly standard type of melodrama [but] developed with all of the author&#x27;s abundant ability to make even melodrama plausible.&quot; Floyd C. Gale stated that the novel had &quot;some of the most inspired descriptive writing in or out of science fiction ... a thoroughgoing delight ... Worth reading and rereading&quot;. Anthony Boucher praised the novel as a convincingly real, scientifically detailed story of the near future, yet infused with that sense of wonder and excitement that we sometimes think vanished from literature about the time our voices changed.&quot;

At the time of the film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, Lester del Rey expressed regret in his review of the film that &quot;Earthlight&quot; had not been filmed instead.

The weapon developed in the story by Earth, which uses an electromagnet-propelled bayonet of liquid metal, is said to have inspired DARPA to develop a weapon along the same lines.

==Notes==

&quot;Earthlight&quot; was first published in 1955, in the US by Ballantine Books and in the UK by Frederick Muller Ltd, and was last printed as a paperback in New York by Del Rey in 1998, . It was later republished in an omnibus edition including &quot;Islands in the Sky&quot;, &quot;Earthlight&quot; and &quot;The Sands of Mars&quot; and called &quot;The Space Trilogy&quot;.

The space battle in &quot;Earthlight&quot; is the only time Clarke wrote such a scene, and it was intended as a specific homage to the attack on the Mardonalian fortress in chapter seven of E. E. Smith&#x27;s &quot;Skylark Three&quot;. The scene where the crew of the &quot;Acheron&quot; have to cross to the &quot;Pegasus&quot; without space suits was inspired by Stanley G. Weinbaum&#x27;s &quot;The Red Peri&quot;.

The crew of Apollo 15 named several craters near their landing site at Hadley–Apennine for science fiction novels and one was named &quot;Earthlight&quot;, for Clarke&#x27;s book. Clarke was delighted to receive a three-dimensional map of the landing site signed and sent by the Apollo 15 crew, two decades after the novel was written.

The story describes regions of heavy metal resources concentrated in certain areas beneath some of the Lunar maria. This anticipates the later discovery of mass concentrations or Mascons, by surveys of the Moon carried out prior to the Apollo landings by the Lunar Orbiter missions, although mascons on the moon probably don&#x27;t represent bodies of ore.

<text>In computational complexity theory, the space hierarchy theorems are separation results that show that both deterministic and nondeterministic machines can solve more problems in (asymptotically) more space, subject to certain conditions. For example, a deterministic Turing machine can solve more decision problems in space &quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot; than in space &quot;n&quot;. The somewhat weaker analogous theorems for time are the time hierarchy theorems.

The foundation for the hierarchy theorems lies in the intuition that with either more time or more space comes the ability to compute more functions (or decide more languages). The hierarchy theorems are used to demonstrate that the time and space complexity classes form a hierarchy where classes with tighter bounds contain fewer languages than those with more relaxed bounds. Here we define and prove the space hierarchy theorem.

The space hierarchy theorems rely on the concept of space-constructible functions. The deterministic and nondeterministic space hierarchy theorems state that for all space-constructible functions &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;),

:formula_1,
where SPACE stands for either DSPACE or NSPACE, and refers to the little o notation.

== Statement ==

Formally, a function formula_2 is space-constructible if formula_3 and there exists a Turing machine
which computes the function formula_4 in space formula_5 when starting
with an input formula_6, where formula_6 represents a string of &quot;n&quot; consecutive 1s. Most of the common functions that we work with are space-constructible, including polynomials, exponents, and logarithms.

For every space-constructible function formula_8, there exists a language that is decidable in space
formula_5 but not in space formula_10.

== Proof ==

The goal is to define a language that can be decided in space formula_5 but not space formula_10. The language is defined as :

formula_13
For any machine that decides a language in space formula_10, will differ in at least one spot from the language of . Namely, for some large enough , will use space formula_15 on formula_16 and will therefore differ at its value.

On the other hand, is in formula_17. The algorithm for deciding the language is as follows:

# On an input , compute formula_18 using space-constructibility, and mark off formula_18 cells of tape. Whenever an attempt is made to use more than formula_18 cells, &quot;reject&quot;.
# If is not of the form formula_21 for some TM , &quot;reject&quot;.
# Simulate on input for at most formula_22 steps (using formula_18 space). If the simulation tries to use more than formula_18 space or more than formula_22 operations, then &quot;reject&quot;.
# If accepted during this simulation, then &quot;reject&quot;; otherwise, &quot;accept&quot;.

Note on step 3: Execution is limited to formula_22 steps in order to avoid the case where does not halt on the input . That is, the case where consumes space of only formula_27 as required, but runs for infinite time.

The above proof holds for the case of PSPACE, but some changes need to be made for the case of NPSPACE. The crucial point is that while on a deterministic TM, acceptance and rejection can be inverted (crucial for step 4), this is not possible on a non-deterministic machine.&lt;br&gt;

For the case of NPSPACE, needs to be redefined first:

formula_28

Now, the algorithm needs to be changed to accept by modifying step 4 to:
* If accepted during this simulation, then &quot;accept&quot;; otherwise, &quot;reject&quot;.

 can not be decided by a TM using formula_10 cells. Assuming can be decided by some TM using formula_10 cells, and following from the Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem, formula_31 can also be determined by a TM (called formula_32) using formula_10 cells. Here lies the contradiction, therefore the assumption must be false:
# If formula_34 (for some large enough ) is not in formula_31 then will accept it, therefore formula_32 rejects , therefore is in formula_31 (contradiction).
# If formula_34 (for some large enough ) is in formula_31 then will reject it, therefore formula_32 accepts , therefore is not in formula_31 (contradiction).

== Comparison and improvements ==

The space hierarchy theorem is stronger than the analogous time hierarchy theorems in several ways:
* It only requires s(n) to be at least log &quot;n&quot; instead of at least &quot;n&quot;.
* It can separate classes with any asymptotic difference, whereas the time hierarchy theorem requires them to be separated by a logarithmic factor.
* It only requires the function to be space-constructible, not time-constructible.

It seems to be easier to separate classes in space than in time. Indeed, whereas the time hierarchy theorem has seen little remarkable improvement since its inception, the nondeterministic space hierarchy theorem has seen at least one important improvement by Viliam Geffert in his 2003 paper &quot;Space hierarchy theorem revised&quot;. This paper made several generalizations of the theorem:

* It relaxes the space-constructibility requirement. Instead of merely separating the union classes and , it separates from where is an arbitrary function and g(n) is a computable function. These functions need not be space-constructible or even monotone increasing.
* It identifies a unary language, or tally language, which is in one class but not the other. In the original theorem, the separating language was arbitrary.
* It does not require to be at least log &quot;n&quot;; it can be any nondeterministically fully space-constructible function.

== Refinement of space hierarchy ==

If space is measured as the number of cells used regardless of alphabet size, then because one can achieve any linear compression by switching to a larger alphabet. However, by measuring space in bits, a much sharper separation is achievable for deterministic space. Instead of being defined up to a multiplicative constant, space is now defined up to an additive constant. However, because any constant amount of external space can be saved by storing the contents into the internal state, we still have .

Assume that f is space-constructible. SPACE is deterministic.
* For a wide variety of sequential computational models, including for Turing machines, SPACE(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)-ω(log(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)+&quot;n&quot;))) ⊊ SPACE(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)). This holds even if SPACE(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)-&quot;ω&quot;(log(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)+&quot;n&quot;))) is defined using a different computational model than because the different models can simulate each other with space overhead. 
* For certain computational models, we even have SPACE(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)-&quot;ω&quot;(1)) ⊊ SPACE(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)). In particular, this holds for Turing machines if we fix the alphabet, the number of heads on the input tape, the number of heads on the worktape (using a single worktape), and add delimiters for the visited portion of the worktape (that can be checked without increasing space usage). SPACE(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)) does not depend on whether the worktape is infinite or semi-infinite. We can also have a fixed number of worktapes if &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is either a SPACE constructible tuple giving the per-tape space usage, or a SPACE(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)-&quot;ω&quot;(log(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)))-constructible number giving the total space usage (not counting the overhead for storing the length of each tape).

The proof is similar to the proof of the space hierarchy theorem, but with two complications: The universal Turing machine has to be space-efficient, and the reversal has to be space-efficient. One can generally construct universal Turing machines with space overhead, and under appropriate assumptions, just space overhead (which may depend on the machine being simulated). For the reversal, the key issue is how to detect if the simulated machine rejects by entering an infinite (space-constrained) loop. Simply counting the number of steps taken would increase space consumption by about . At the cost of a potentially exponential time increase, loops can be detected space-efficiently as follows:

Modify the machine to erase everything and go to a specific configuration A on success. Use depth-first search to determine whether A is reachable in the space bound from the starting configuration. The search starts at A and goes over configurations that lead to A. Because of determinism, this can be done in place and without going into a loop.

It can also be determined whether the machine exceeds a space bound (as opposed to looping within the space bound) by iterating over all configurations about to exceed the space bound and checking (again using depth-first search) whether the initial configuration leads to any of them.

== Corollaries ==

=== Corollary 1 ===

&quot;For any two functions formula_42, formula_43, where formula_44 is formula_45 and formula_46 is space-constructible, formula_47.&quot;

This corollary lets us separate various space complexity classes.
For any natural number k, the function formula_48 is space-constructible. Therefore for any two natural numbers formula_49 we can
prove formula_50.

=== Corollary 2 ===

:NL ⊊ PSPACE.

==== Proof ====

Savitch&#x27;s theorem shows that formula_51, while the space hierarchy theorem shows that formula_52. The result is this corollary along with the fact that TQBF ∉ NL
since TQBF is PSPACE-complete.

This could also be proven using the non-deterministic space hierarchy theorem to show that NL ⊊ NPSPACE, and using Savitch&#x27;s theorem to show that PSPACE = NPSPACE.

=== Corollary 3 ===

:PSPACE ⊊ EXPSPACE.

This last corollary shows the existence of decidable problems that are intractable. In other words, their decision procedures must use more than polynomial space.

=== Corollary 4 ===

There are problems in requiring an arbitrarily large exponent to solve; therefore does not collapse to (&quot;n&quot;&quot;k&quot;) for some constant &quot;k&quot;.

=== Corollary 5 ===

:SPACE(&quot;n&quot;) ≠ PTIME.

To see it, assume the contrary, thus any problem decided in space formula_53 is decided in time formula_54, and any problem formula_55 decided in space formula_56 is decided in time formula_57. Now formula_58, thus P is closed under such a change of bound, that is formula_59, so formula_60. This implies that for all formula_61, but the space hierarchy theorem implies that formula_62, and Corollary 6 follows. Note that this argument neither proves that formula_63 nor that formula_64, as to reach a contradiction we used the negation of both sentences, that is we used both inclusions, and can only deduce that at least one fails. It is currently unknown which fail(s) but conjectured that both do, that is that formula_65 and formula_66 are incomparable -at least for deterministic space. This question is related to that of the time complexity of (nondeterministic) linear bounded automata which accept the complexity class formula_67 (aka as context-sensitive languages, CSL); so by the above CSL is not known to be decidable in polynomial time -see also Kuroda&#x27;s two problems on LBA.

<text>Dick Clement (born 5 September 1937) is an English writer, director and producer. He became known for his writing partnership with Ian La Frenais for television series including &quot;The Likely Lads&quot;, &quot;Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?&quot;, &quot;Porridge&quot;, &quot;Lovejoy&quot; and &quot;Auf Wiedersehen, Pet&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, England, Clement was educated at Bishop&#x27;s Stortford College, and then spent a year in the US on an exchange visit. Upon his return, he completed his National Service with the Royal Air Force.

He then joined the BBC as a studio manager and started writing scripts and comedy sketches.

==Writing partnership with Ian La Frenais==
Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais have enjoyed a long and successful career embracing films, television and theatre. Their partnership began in the mid-1960s with &quot;The Likely Lads&quot;, and by the end of the decade they had also written three feature films: &quot;The Jokers&quot;, &quot;Otley&quot;, (directed by Clement) and &quot;Hannibal Brooks&quot;. Clement also directed the BBC sketch show &quot;Not Only... But Also&quot;, which starred Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, and, for the big screen, Iris Murdoch&#x27;s &quot;A Severed Head&quot;.

In the early 1970s, two other features were scripted by Clement and La Frenais: &quot;Villain&quot;, starring Richard Burton, and &quot;Catch Me a Spy&quot;, starring Kirk Douglas. In this same period, they created their award-winning series &quot;Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?&quot;, followed by &quot;Porridge&quot;, &quot;Thick as Thieves&quot; and a spin-off from &quot;Porridge&quot;, &quot;Going Straight&quot;. There were big screen versions of both &quot;The Likely Lads&quot; and &quot;Porridge&quot;, the latter directed by Clement, and a &#x27;rockumentary&#x27;, &quot;To Russia With Elton&quot;, in 1979.

During the same period, they adapted Keith Waterhouse&#x27;s &quot;Billy Liar&quot; into the stage musical &quot;Billy&quot;, starring Michael Crawford, which ran at London&#x27;s Drury Lane Theatre for two and a half years. By this time they were living in California, where they wrote the American version of &quot;Porridge&quot;, &quot;On the Rocks&quot;, and the feature film, &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;, starring Peter Sellers.

In the 1980s, Clement directed John Wells&#x27;s hit stage play &quot;Anyone For Denis?&quot; He directed the films &quot;Bullshot&quot; and &quot;Water&quot;, which were produced by his writing partner La Frenais; the pair also scripted the latter film, and contributed extensive, uncredited writing work on the unofficial James Bond movie &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;. In 1987, they wrote and produced &quot;Vice Versa&quot;. Their television work at the time included the ITV series &quot;Auf Wiedersehen, Pet&quot;, which was voted ITV&#x27;s Favourite TV Programme of all Time in a &quot;Radio Times&quot; readers&#x27; poll in order to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the station.
By the beginning of the 1990s, La Frenais had created the long-running series, &quot;Lovejoy&quot;, and co-created &quot;Spender&quot; with Jimmy Nail. In America, they were writers and supervising producers for HBO&#x27;s Emmy-winning show, &quot;Tracey Takes On...&quot;, for four years. They scripted the film adaptation of &quot;The Commitments&quot;, which won the Evening Standard&#x27;s Peter Sellers Award for Comedy and the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, and also wrote the screenplays for &quot;Excess Baggage&quot; and &quot;Still Crazy&quot;. In addition, they did uncredited rewrites on &quot;The Rock&quot;, starring Sean Connery, and &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; for producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay (who also directed the film). They had also been commissioned to write a draft of Super Mario Bros. for directors Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel. This would ultimately lead the film into pre-production after several failed drafts but it was heavily rewritten by Ed Solomon once Walt Disney Studios acquired distribution rights.

In 2005, Clement and La Frenais had two television adaptations of best-selling novels broadcast by the BBC: Jonathan Coe&#x27;s &quot;The Rotter&#x27;s Club&quot; for BBC Two, and Robert Harris&#x27;s Archangel, starring Daniel Craig, for BBC One. That year also saw the UK release of &quot;Goal!&quot;, a film they co-scripted. In 2006, they were credited as writers on the animated film &quot;Flushed Away&quot;, whilst 2007 saw the release of the jukebox musical &quot;Across the Universe&quot;, based around the songs of The Beatles, which they scripted, and, with director Julie Taymor, wrote the story for. The 2008 film &quot;The Bank Job&quot;, starring Jason Statham, is their last screenplay work to date.

Two new television series written by them aired in 2017: a new version of &quot;Porridge&quot;, starring Kevin Bishop, for the BBC, and &quot;Henry IX&quot; for UKTV Gold, starring Charles Edwards. The duo have also written the book for two stage musicals in development, &quot;Juke Box Hero&quot; and &quot;Victoria&#x27;s Secret&quot;.

Clement and La Frenais were both awarded OBEs in the 2007 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours list.

==Personal life==

<doc id="663056" wikidata="Q5982007" url="?curid=663056" title="Ian La Frenais">
<text>Ian La Frenais (born 7 January 1937) is an English writer best known for his creative partnership with Dick Clement. They are most famous for television series including &quot;The Likely Lads&quot;, &quot;Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?&quot;, &quot;Porridge&quot; and its sequel &quot;Going Straight&quot;, &quot;Lovejoy&quot; and &quot;Auf Wiedersehen, Pet&quot;.

==Early life==
La Frenais was born in Monkseaton, Northumberland; his father was an accountant. As a child at Park Primary School in Whitley Bay, La Frenais enjoyed art and writing. He then attended Dame Allan&#x27;s Boys School in Newcastle upon Tyne, and completed his National Service in the British Army. After working as a salesman for a tobacco company, he began composing songs for a weekly satirical programme on Tyne Tees Television and then moved to London where he worked for a market research company.

==Writing partnership with Dick Clement==
Ian La Frenais and Dick Clement have enjoyed a long and successful career embracing films, television and theatre. Their partnership began in the mid-1960s with the hit television show &quot;The Likely Lads&quot;, and by the end of the decade they had also written three feature films: &quot;The Jokers&quot;, &quot;Otley&quot; (directed by Clement) and &quot;Hannibal Brooks&quot;.

In the early 1970s, they worked on two other features: &quot;Villain&quot;, starring Richard Burton, and &quot;Catch Me a Spy&quot; (again directed by Clement), starring Kirk Douglas. In this same period, they created their award-winning TV series &quot;Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?&quot;; this was followed by &quot;Porridge&quot;, &quot;Thick as Thieves&quot; and &quot;Going Straight&quot;. There were big-screen versions of both &quot;The Likely Lads&quot; and &quot;Porridge&quot;, and a &#x27;rockumentary&#x27;, &quot;To Russia With Elton&quot;, in 1979.

Earlier that decade they had adapted Keith Waterhouse&#x27;s &quot;Billy Liar&quot; into the stage musical &quot;Billy&quot;, starring Michael Crawford, which ran at London&#x27;s Drury Lane Theatre for two-and-a-half years.

By the late 1970s, they were living in California, where they wrote &quot;On the Rocks&quot;, an American version of &quot;Porridge&quot;, and &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;, a feature film starring Peter Sellers.

In the 1980s, their work included most of the TV series &quot;Auf Wiedersehen, Pet&quot;, which was voted ITV&#x27;s Favourite TV Programme of all Time in a &quot;Radio Times&quot; readers&#x27; poll to celebrate the network&#x27;s 60th anniversary, and uncredited writing work on the James Bond film &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;. La Frenais produced the films &quot;Bullshot&quot; (1983) and &quot;Water&quot; (1985), both directed by Clement; they also substantially wrote the latter. In 1987, they wrote and produced &quot;Vice Versa&quot;.

In the US, he and Clement were writers and supervising producers on HBO&#x27;s Emmy-winning show &quot;Tracey Takes On...&quot; for four years in the 1990s. Their films around this time include &quot;The Commitments&quot;, which won both the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;″s Peter Sellers Award for Comedy and a BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, &quot;Excess Baggage&quot; and &quot;Still Crazy&quot;. In addition, they did uncredited rewrites on &quot;The Rock&quot; (starring Sean Connery) for Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay.

More recent television includes &quot;Archangel&quot; (starring Daniel Craig) and &quot;The Rotters&#x27; Club&quot;, which they adapted from best-sellers by Robert Harris and Jonathan Coe respectively. Their most recent film credits include &quot;Goal! The Dream Begins&quot;, the animated film &quot;Flushed Away&quot;, &quot;Across the Universe&quot; and &quot;The Bank Job&quot;.

Two new television series written by them were broadcast in 2017: an updated version of &quot;Porridge&quot;, starring Kevin Bishop, for the BBC, and &quot;Henry IX&quot; for UKTV Gold, starring Charles Edwards. They have written the books for two stage musicals in development, &quot;Juke Box Hero&quot; and &quot;Victoria&#x27;s Secret&quot;.

===Other credits===
In addition to his long-running collaborations with Clement, La Frenais has created, co-created, written and/or contributed to many other TV series, including &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot;, several episodes of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Comedy Playhouse&quot;, &quot;The Other &#x27;Arf&quot; (1980–81), the long-running series &quot;Lovejoy&quot; and the hit 1990s BBC detective series &quot;Spender&quot; (co-written with actor and singer Jimmy Nail).

Like Clement, La Frenais was made an OBE in the Queen&#x27;s 2007 Birthday Honours list.

==Personal life==
Since 1984, Ian La Frenais has been married to artist Doris Vartan, the mother of actor Michael Vartan.

La Frenais supports the football club Newcastle United. He is a patron of the Whitley Bay Film Festival.

<text>A Fall of Moondust is a hard science fiction novel by British writer Arthur C. Clarke, first published in 1961. It was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Novel, and was the first science fiction novel selected to become a &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; Condensed Book.

==Plot== 
By the 21st century, the Moon has been colonized, and although still very much a research establishment, it is visited by tourists who can afford the trip. One of its attractions is a cruise across one of the lunar seas, named the &quot;Sea of Thirst&quot;, (located within the Sinus Roris) filled with an extremely fine dust, a fine powder far drier than the contents of a terrestrial desert and which almost flows like water, instead of the common regolith which covers most of the lunar surface. A specially designed &quot;boat&quot; named the &quot;Selene&quot; skims over the surface of the dust in the same manner as a jetski.

But on one cruise, a moonquake causes a cavern to collapse, upsetting the equilibrium. As the dust-cruiser &quot;Selene&quot; passes over, it sinks about 15 metres below the surface of the dust, hiding the vessel from view, and trapping it beneath the dust. Immediately there are potentially fatal problems for the crew and passengers inside. The sunken &quot;Selene&quot; has a limited air supply, there is no way for heat generated to escape, communications are impossible, and no one else is sure where &quot;Selene&quot; has been lost. As the &quot;Selene&quot; heats up and the air becomes unbreathable, young Captain Pat Harris and his chief stewardess Sue Wilkins try to keep the passengers occupied and psychologically stable while waiting to be rescued. They are helped by a retired space ship captain and explorer, Commodore Hansteen, who is initially traveling incognito.

Chief Engineer (Earthside) Robert Lawrence is sceptical that a rescue can be mounted, even if the &quot;Selene&quot; can be located. He is ready to abandon an initially unsuccessful search, when he is contacted by Thomas Lawson, a brilliant but eccentric astronomer who, from his vantage point on a satellite high above the Moon, &quot;Lagrange II&quot;, believes he has detected the remains of a heat trail on the surface. An expedition is organised and Lawrence indeed makes contact with the &quot;Selene&quot;. However the completely alien environment results in numerous unforeseen complications. The rescue mission decides to sink a tube supplying oxygen to the &quot;Selene&quot; first, in an effort to buy time to think of a way to get the passengers out. However, this becomes a race against the clock, as the heat in the &quot;Selene&quot; knocks out the chemical air purification system and the passengers are suffering from CO2 poisoning. To preserve air, most passengers enter a chemically induced sleep, with only Pat Harris and physicist Duncan McKenzie staying awake. Just in time, the rescuers manage to drill a hole in the roof and deliver an air supply.

A plan is hatched to save the passengers of the &quot;Selene&quot; by sinking several concrete caissons to the roof of the ship and cutting a hole. When the first caisson is sunk, disaster strikes again: the liquid waste of the passengers had been expelled out of the ship, turning the dust around it into mud, which causes another, smaller, cave-in. The &quot;Selene&quot; sinks once more, this time only a small distance, but crucially, at a slope. The caissons cannot be connected to the roof which is now sloping at 30 degrees. The air supply and communications have also been damaged. After restoring these latter two, a new plan is made to sink the caissons, but now the bottom one has a flexible fitting attached to it which can be mounted to the sloping roof of the &quot;Selene&quot;. The rescue mission works according to plan: the caissons are sunk, the dust is scooped out and the connection is made, but now time is running out again. When the air supply holes were drilled, &quot;Selene&quot;&#x27;s double hull was breached and the space in between slowly filled with dust. The metal-rich dust reached the battery packs and short-circuited them. This causes the battery compartment in the stern to burn slowly. The resulting breach is barricaded by the passengers, but dust is still pouring in and there is a fear that the burning material will cause the liquid oxygen supply to explode. Meanwhile, Robert Lawrence is working in the rescue shaft: he sets a small ring charge to make a hole in the roof. Just in time, the hole is made and the passengers escape through the shaft. Captain Harris is the last to leave, up to his waist in dust. Just when he is clear of the shaft, the liquid oxygen explodes, destroying the &quot;Selene&quot;.

A short epilogue sees Lawrence writing his memoirs, Pat Harris and Sue Wilkins are married. Pat Harris is the captain of the &quot;Selene II&quot; on its maiden cruise which will also be the last cruise for Harris as he is hoping to transfer to the space service.

==Reception==
&quot;Galaxy&quot; reviewer Floyd C. Gale rated &quot;A Fall of Moondust&quot; five stars out of five, praising it as &quot;emotionally gripping [and] astute&quot; and that &quot;it measures up to the very highest standard of his previous efforts. No praise can be higher&quot;.

==Adaptations==
A BBC Radio drama of the story was produced in 1981. It features David Buck as Captain Pat Harris
and Barry Foster as Chief Engineer Lawrence. In 2008, the production was released on BBC Compact Disc ().

<text>Ylöjärvi () is a town in Finland, located in the Pirkanmaa region. It lies to the west of the regional capital, Tampere. The population of Ylöjärvi is approximately , while the metropolitan area has a population of approximately . It is the most populous municipality in Finland, and the third largest in the Pirkanmaa region after Tampere and Nokia.

Ylöjärvi is located northwest of Tampere and north of the capital city of Helsinki in Finland. Ylöjärvi has an area of of which is water. The population density is .

Ylöjärvi is mainly a rural town. It does not have a clear centre; the Tampere-Vaasa highway (E12) and the Tampere-Seinäjoki railway divide the centre of the municipality into two large distinct parts: the Church Village and Soppeenmäki. The railway, completed in 1971, has no passenger seats in the Ylöjärvi area, so buses provide all public transport. The population has grown in recent years. In 1990 it was about 18,000, in 2011 it was about 30,000, and now it is about .

The neighbouring municipalities are Hämeenkyrö, Ikaalinen, Kihniö, Nokia, Parkano, Ruovesi, Tampere and Virrat. The municipality of Viljakkala was merged with Ylöjärvi in 2007. The municipality of Kuru was merged with Ylöjärvi in 2009. The coat of arms of Ylöjärvi was designed by Gustaf von Numers and confirmed in 1954.

The results of the 2021 Finnish local elections, resulted in True Finns being the largest political party on the Ylöjärvi council.

==History==
The chapel parish of Ylöjärvi was founded in 1779 by separating it from Pirkkala. The first church in Ylöjärvi, located on the site of the current church, was completed in 1781, but was destroyed in a fire caused by lightning in 1842. Ylöjärvi was founded as a municipality in 1869. Since January 1, 2004, it has been known as a town (&quot;kaupunki&quot;). The Finnish Museum of Refrigeration also locates at Ylöjärvi.

==Demographics==
The following graph shows the population development of the city since 1805. The diagram uses the area division in force at the time.

===Food===
In the 1980s, overly sweeted &quot;limppu&quot; and the &quot;sauna smoked&quot; ham were named Ylöjärvi&#x27;s traditional parish dishes.

===&quot;Tree Mountain&quot;===
The town is the location of &quot;Tree Mountain&quot;, land art by Agnes Denes. This work was conceived in 1983, and construction was announced by the Finnish government at the 1992 Earth Summit. Construction was complete in 1996, and the site is legally protected for the next 400 years.
Tree Mountain was dedicated in June 1996 by the President of Finland.

==Geography==

It consists of the Toronto Islands and the part of the City of Toronto bounded on the south by Toronto Harbour, and on the west, north and east by a line drawn from the harbour north on Spencer Avenue, east along the Gardiner Expressway, north on Dufferin, east on Queen Street West, southeast along the Canadian Pacific Railway line, north along Dovercourt Road, east along Dundas Street West, north along Ossington Avenue, east along the Canadian Pacific Railway situated north of Dupont Street, south along Avenue Road and Queens Park Crescent West, east along College Street and south along Yonge Street to the Harbour.

These borders were somewhat changed in the 2004 redistribution. The northwestern corner, a somewhat pro-NDP area was lost to Davenport. A large, but mostly business area of Toronto Centre—Rosedale between University Avenue and Yonge St. was given to the riding. This region tends to support the Liberals. The Toronto Islands were also added to the riding from Toronto Centre—Rosedale. This area is very strongly NDP and has a highly activist population that provides many campaign workers for the New Democrats.

==History==
The riding was created in 1987 from Trinity and Spadina, and smaller parts of Toronto Centre—Rosedale and Parkdale—High Park.

It consisted initially of the part of the City of Toronto bounded on the south by Toronto Harbour, on the east by Avenue Road, Queen&#x27;s Park Crescent West, University Avenue and York Street, and on the west and north by a line drawn from the harbour north along Spencer Avenue, east along the Gardiner Expressway, north along Atlantic Avenue, southeast along the Canadian National Railway line, north along Dovercourt Road, east along Bloor Street West, north along Ossington Avenue, and east along the Canadian Pacific Railway line to Avenue Road.

In 2003, it was given its current boundaries as described above.

As per 2012 federal electoral boundaries redistribution and the 2013 representation order, Trinity—Spadina was dissolved following the conclusion of the next general election to be called after May 1, 2014. Most of the riding&#x27;s territory, covering the area south of Dundas Street, became the new riding of Spadina—Fort York. The area north of Dundas and west of a line following Bay Street and Front Street became part of the new seat of University—Rosedale, while the area east of Bay Street and north of Front Street became part of Toronto Centre.


===Members of Parliament===

This riding has elected the following members of the House of Commons of Canada:





The seat became vacant on March 12, 2014, when Olivia Chow resigned in order to run in the Toronto mayoral election.

<doc id="663064" wikidata="Q948870" url="?curid=663064" title="Earl Hamner Jr.">
<text>Earl Henry Hamner Jr. (July 10, 1923 – March 24, 2016) was an American television writer and producer (sometimes credited as Earl Hamner), best known for his work in the 1970s and 1980s as the creator of two long-running series, &quot;The Waltons&quot; and &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;. As a novelist, he is best known for &quot;Spencer&#x27;s Mountain&quot;, which was inspired by his own childhood and formed the basis for both the film of the same name and the television series &quot;The Waltons&quot;, for which he provided voice-over narration. at the beginning of most episodes to set the scene and provide context and occasionally at the end of the program.

==Early life==

Hamner was born July 10, 1923, in Schuyler, Virginia, (Nelson County) of Doris Marion (née Giannini) and Earl Henry Hamner Sr. The oldest of eight children, Hamner had four brothers and three sisters. The other boys, from youngest to next-oldest, were James Edmund, Willard Harold, Paul Louis, and Clifton Anderson. The girls, from youngest to oldest, were Nancy Alice, Audrey Jane, and Marion Lee. 

The family of Hamner&#x27;s mother, the Gianninis, were immigrants who came to the United States from Lucca, Italy, in the 1700s. His father&#x27;s family came to Virginia from Wales to the west of England on the island of Great Britain (modern United Kingdom). Until the early 1900s, the Hamners were tobacco farmers near the James River, when they moved further northwest to Schuyler, located in Nelson County at the Shenandoah Valley in the Appalachian Mountains / Allegheny Mountains chain on the eastern slopes of the Blue Ridge Mountains.

Schuyler was a company town where the economy was based in soapstone mining by New Alberene Stone, and the town was hit hard by the economic / financial hardships in the Great Depression of the 1930s when the company and its mines closed. Hamner&#x27;s father worked in the mines from the time his eldest son was born until the company&#x27;s closing. After losing his job, Earl Sr. could only find work as a machinist at the DuPont de Nemours Company chemical plant in Waynesboro, Virginia, about 30 miles away further north. Due to the distance between home and work, Earl Sr. lived at a boarding house in Waynesboro during the weekdays and traveled back to Schuyler and his family on the weekends. Taking a bus from Waynesboro to Charlottesville and another stop along the way, Hamner&#x27;s father would walk then the six miles further to the family&#x27;s rural home to complete his weekly journey. His walk on a snowy Christmas Eve in 1933 was the inspiration for Hamner&#x27;s 1970 novel, &quot;The Homecoming&quot;, which became a Christmas holiday made-for-TV pilot film special, aired on the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) television network in mid-December 1971, (starring Andrew Duggan and Patricia Neal and the inspiration for &quot;The Waltons&quot; series beginning broadcasting its first episode nine months later in September 1972. 
During Earl&#x27;s childhood years, the family (all except Earl Sr.) attended a small white wood-frame clapboard church known as Schuyler Baptist Church. In April 2014, the church honored Earl with a special worship service in connection with the filming and release of a film documentary titled &quot;Earl Hamner, Storyteller&quot;.

Hamner was in his sophomore / second year on a scholarship at the University of Richmond when he was drafted into the United States Army during World War II (1939/1941-1945). He was first trained to defuse landmines and then transferred to the Quartermaster Corps because he could type. He served in France after the famous D-day invasion of Normandy in June 1944. Following the war, he subsequently attended Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois (near Chicago) and then graduated from the University of Cincinnati in Cincinnati, Ohio with a degree in broadcast communications.

==Career==
On January 15, 1953, his short teleplay &quot;The Hound of Heaven&quot; was televised on &quot;The Kate Smith Hour&quot; which aired 1950 to 1954 on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) television network, the tele-play featured actors James Dean and John Carradine. 

In 1954, Hamner wrote &quot;Hit and Run&quot;, an episode of the early legal drama &quot;Justice.&quot; He reprised the theme a decade later in the 1964 &quot;You Drive&quot; episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;.

In the early 1960s, Hamner contributed eight more episodes to the highly regarded science fiction series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. His first script acceptance for the series was his big writing break in Hollywood. He also wrote or co-wrote eight episodes of the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) animal TV series &quot;Gentle Ben&quot; (1967–1969) and four episodes of the sitcom &quot;Nanny and the Professor&quot; (1970-1971) for the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) TV network.

He also created two other short-lived television series of &quot;Apple&#x27;s Way&quot; (1974–1975) starring Ronny Cox on CBS, and &quot;Boone&quot; (1983–1984) starring Tom Byrd on NBC.

Hamner often used distant family names to title his projects: Spencer (&quot;Spencer&#x27;s Mountain&quot;) is the maiden name of his paternal grandmother Susan Henry Spencer Hamner. &quot;The Waltons name&quot; derives from his paternal grandfather Walter Clifton Hamner and great-grandfather Walter Leland Hamner.

==Death==
Hamner died in Los Angeles, California, of bladder cancer on March 24, 2016, aged 92. On July 8, 2023, a bronze statue of Hamner was unveiled in Nelson County, Virginia, two days prior to his centennial birthday.

<text>Prince of Beira (, feminine: &quot;Princesa da Beira&quot;) is a title traditionally granted to the heir apparent to the throne of Portugal. The title&#x27;s original use that it be granted on the eldest daughter of the reigning monarch of Portugal. Tied with the title of Prince of Beira, is Duke of Barcelos, as heir to the Duke of Braganza and Prince of Brazil (&quot;later&quot; Prince Royal of Portugal). 
The title&#x27;s name has its origins in the Beira province in central Portugal.

==History==
The title was presumably created (no records of its earlier existence or grants) by King John IV of Portugal, the new monarch, first of the Braganza dynasty, sometime in the 1640s. It was firstly given to his eldest surviving daughter, Infanta Joanna of Portugal, 1st Princess of Beira. It was the King&#x27;s intention that the male heir apparent would be Prince of Brazil and later also Duke of Braganza, whereas Princess of Beira was originally quite similar to that of French Madame Royale or the British Princess Royal. The title had no original connection to being one for next heirs of the throne - King John IV had a second son, and soon a third, but the daughter kept Beira and the boys received dukedoms (Braganza and Beja). However, Joanna died young in 1653.

Afterwards, the title kept being granted and regranted several times during the remaining Portuguese monarchy. However, the precedent of being granted to the monarch&#x27;s eldest daughter in a situation where he had several living sons, was repeated sometimes in later centuries.

The title&#x27;s first connection with the position of the heir was from 1669 onwards, when it was held by the Infanta Isabel Luísa, Princess of Beira (1669–90), the only then living child of King Peter II. She received it as the eldest daughter of the king, but as she also was the heiress presumptive until 1688, a new tradition got its groundwork.

According to the first tradition, the next holder would be Infanta Barbara of Portugal (1711–58), the eldest daughter of King John V of Portugal. In 1729, she wedded Infante Fernando of Spain, the Prince of Asturias.

Then, on December 17, 1734 the title was created anew by King John V of Portugal, in favour of his newborn eldest granddaughter Infanta Maria Francisca. She was the eldest daughter of the heir-apparent of the monarch. This was the first time when it was granted two generations down from the monarch. As the future Joseph I (the then Prince of Brazil) was to remain without sons, the new Princess of Beira would later become the proclaimed heiress and ultimately to ascend the throne.

In 1750 the newly ascended King Joseph I (believing that no sons would be forthcoming--indeed, his wife and he produced no further issue after 1746, as is known in hindsight) proclaimed his eldest daughter the official heiress and granted her the &quot;crown-princely&quot; title Princess of Brazil (but apparently not that Duke of Braganza). He in 1761 further granted Maria&#x27;s eldest son, Infante Dom José Francisco (1761–88), the title &quot;Prince of Beira&quot;. For the first time, the title was held by a male.

This created a new tradition. The situation now, effectively, was that the king&#x27;s official heir held the Princedom of Brazil, and Prince of Beira was Brazil&#x27;s heir-apparent. The situation had been the same (though unintentionally) during 1734-50, when the monarch&#x27;s heir-apparent was Prince of Brazil, and Brazil&#x27;s obvious heir was Princess of Beira. This was to be repeated after that time, as monarchs granted Beira to the second heir-apparent whenever possible.

(The way the titles &quot;Duke of Braganza&quot; and &quot;Prince of Brazil&quot; were held is identical with the way the titles of Duke of Cornwall and of Rothesay are held in the UK. The male heir apparent received it when the relevant parent ascended the throne or, if the title was vacant, at birth. During the 1645-1822 period, the &quot;Prince of Brazil&quot; always belonged to the heir apparent to the throne, who also received the title Duke of Braganza. In 1750 though, Brazil--but not Braganza--was specifically granted to the female heiress, as she was proclaimed the official successor.)

The future King John VI himself never became Prince of Beira--he became Prince of Brazil and Duke of Braganza directly at the death of his elder brother.

According to the first tradition, the next holder of Beira would be Infanta Mariana Vitória of Portugal (1768–88), the eldest daughter of Maria I and Pedro III. She died two months after her eldest brother. In 1785, she was married to Infante Gabriel of Spain (1752–88), whom she predeceased by some weeks. Their three children were granted &quot;Infantes of Portugal&quot; in addition to that of Spain by their grandmother. The others going having died, the eldest son, Infante Pedro Carlos of Spain and Portugal (1786–1812) married his Portuguese cousin Teresa, Princess of Beira, and left issue (see below).

Queen Maria I and her regent, the future King John VI, granted the Beira in turn to John&#x27;s heirs-apparent, and the second of them, Infante Dom Pedro Francisco survived to become in 1816 the Prince of Brazil, the last Portuguese heir-apparent to hold that title (as he himself later made Brazil independent).

King John VI followed the first tradition also, and Beira was granted to his eldest daughter Infanta Dona Maria Teresa. She was firstly the wife of her short-lived cousin Infante Pedro Carlos of Spain and Portugal and secondly the wife of the first Carlist pretender, Infante Don Carlos of Spain. Teresa&#x27;s only child was her son with Pedro Carlos, Infante Don Sebastian of Spain and Portugal(1811–75), from whom the Dukes of Marchena, Durcal, Ansola and Hernani descend.

In the second tradition, when born in 1821, the then Prince of Brazil&#x27;s eldest son João Carlos was granted Beira in 1821 after birth, he being the third in the heir-apparent line, but he died the following year, some months before Brazil&#x27;s secession. Emperor Pedro&#x27;s next son, born in 1825, received no title from Portugal.

According to the first tradition, the next holder would be Infanta Maria da Glória Joana (1819–53), the eldest daughter of King Pedro IV. She, however, ascended the throne in 1826 as Queen Maria II.

The second tradition-based need arose only in 1887, when Infante Dom Luís Filipe was born in the last years of his grandfather King Luís I&#x27;s reign. Luís Filipe was Prince of Beira 1887-89 and then succeeded his own father, the new king, as crown prince, becoming 21st Duke of Braganza.

<doc id="663077" wikidata="Q4713563" url="?curid=663077" title="Alden Nowlan">
<text>Alden Albert Nowlan (; January 25, 1933 – June 27, 1983) was a Canadian poet, novelist, and playwright.

==History==
Alden Nowlan was born into rural poverty in Stanley, Nova Scotia, adjacent to Mosherville, and close to the small town of Windsor, Nova Scotia, along a stretch of dirt road that he would later refer to as Desolation Creek. His father, Freeman Lawrence Nowlan, worked sporadically as a manual labourer.

His mother, Grace Reese, was only 14 years of age when Nowlan was born, and she soon left the family, leaving Alden and her younger daughter Harriet to the care of their paternal grandmother. The family discouraged education as a waste of time, and Nowlan left school after only four grades. At the age of 14, he went to work in the village sawmill. At the age of 16, he discovered the new library in Windsor. Often on weekends he would travel eighteen miles to the library to get books, which broadened his already keen reading. &quot;I wrote (as I read) in secret.&quot; Nowlan remembered. &quot;My father would as soon have seen me wear lipstick.&quot;

==Career and later life==
At 19, Nowlan&#x27;s artfully embroidered résumé landed him a job with &quot;Observer&quot;, a newspaper in Hartland, New Brunswick. While working at the &quot;Observer&quot;, Nowlan began writing books of poetry, the first of which was published by Fredericton&#x27;s Fiddlehead Poetry Books.

Nowlan eventually settled permanently in New Brunswick. In 1963, he married Claudine Orser, a typesetter on his former paper, and moved to Saint John with her and her son, John, whom he adopted. He became the night editor for the Saint John Telegraph Journal and continued to write poetry. In 1966, Nowlan was diagnosed with throat cancer. After three surgeries and a subsequent radiation treatment, his health began to improve. He wrote poems about his brush with death. In 1967, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, and his collection &quot;Bread, Wine and Salt&quot; was awarded the Governor General&#x27;s Award for Poetry. Soon afterward, the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton offered him the position of Writer-in-Residence. He remained in the position until his death on June 27, 1983, after collapsing at his home with severe emphysema.

==Awards and recognition==
Nowlan&#x27;s most notable literary achievements include the Governor General&#x27;s Award for &quot;Bread, Wine and Salt&quot; (1967) and a Guggenheim Fellowship. He was writer-in-residence at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton from 1968 until his death in 1983. In New Brunswick, the Alden Nowlan Award for Excellence in English-language Literary Arts is named in his honour.

Nowlan is one of Canada&#x27;s most popular 20th-century poets, and his appearance in the anthology &quot;Staying Alive&quot; (2002) has helped to spread his popularity beyond Canada.

In the 1970s, Nowlan met and became close friends with theatre director Walter Learning. The two collaborated on a number of plays, including &quot;A Gift to Last&quot;, &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;The Dollar Woman&quot;, and &quot;The Incredible Murder of Cardinal Tosca.&quot;

Nowlan&#x27;s Fredericton home is now the residence of the Graduate Student Association at the University of New Brunswick. Dubbed &quot;Windsor Castle&quot; by Nowlan after its location on Windsor Street, the simple building is now officially called the Alden Nowlan House.

Nowlan is buried in the Poets&#x27; Corner of the Forest Hill cemetery in Fredericton, New Brunswick.

<doc id="663078" wikidata="Q4442" url="?curid=663078" title="Wanted (comics)">
<text>Wanted is a comic book limited series created by writer Mark Millar and artist J. G. Jones. It was published by Top Cow in 2003 and 2004 as part of Millarworld. It features an amoral protagonist who discovers he is the heir to a career as a supervillain assassin in a world where such villains have secretly taken control of the planet. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; dubbed the title &quot;the &quot;Watchmen&quot; for super-villains.&quot;

A film adaptation, very loosely based on the comic, was released in 2008. A sequel, &quot;Big Game&quot;, released in 2023 and featured Wesley and the Fraternity crossing over with the other Millarworld franchises. 

==Publication history==
As with &quot;&quot;, Millar claims that the concept for the series occurred to him when he was a child. In this case, it came to him after his brother told him that there were no superheroes anymore because they had all disappeared after a great war with their respective supervillains.

==Plot==
Wesley Gibson is a loser cubicle rat who is abused by almost everyone in his life, including his boss, a local gang, his unfaithful girlfriend, and his best friend with whom his girlfriend is having an affair. Wesley was raised by his pacifist mother after they were abandoned by his father, causing him to grow up into a wimp. All this changes when he is visited by the Fox, an assassin who shoots everyone in a sandwich shop before revealing herself to be a member of the Fraternity, a powerful organization of supervillains that rules the world. So long as they maintain secrecy, they are able to commit any crime without any consequences. The Fraternity wishes to recruit Wesley to replace his father, a supervillain known as the Killer, who was killed by an unknown assassin.

The Fox introduces Wesley to Professor Solomon Selzer, a brilliant mad scientist and leader of the North and South American chapter of the Fraternity. The Professor helps Wesley realize his powers by provoking him into shooting the wings off flies. The Professor explains that a long time ago, the world was overrun by both superheroes and supervillains. Tired of being repeatedly defeated and jailed, the supervillains joined and staged a revolution that Wesley&#x27;s father was a part of. After a long, bloody war, the superheroes were defeated. Using magic and advanced technology, the newly formed Fraternity was able to erase the world&#x27;s memories of superheroes and supervillains. All that remained were faint, inaccurate memories, which were the cause of superhero comic books and other media. Many of the surviving heroes now believed themselves to be actors who had played superheroes.

The Professor also explains to Wesley that Fox and his father had once worked for Mr. Rictus, who controlled the Australian chapter of the Fraternity. When Rictus visits the Professor&#x27;s headquarters, Fox implies that she and the Killer left Rictus&#x27; chapter because he had been harming children.

The Fraternity begins training Wesley to use his newfound powers. The training focuses on not just his physical skills but on his personality. He is desensitized to violence and eventually learns to enjoy it. He is told to commit random acts of violence before undertaking acts of revenge on anyone who even slightly wronged him. He soon becomes a full-fledged Fraternity member, accompanying them on raids of alternate universes and other missions.

Wesley is assigned to be the Professor&#x27;s personal bodyguard during a Fraternity convention in which the leaders of the Fraternity&#x27;s five chapters will meet. The five leaders are the Professor, Mr. Rictus, Adam-One, the Future, and the Emperor. Here, he learns that Rictus and the Future had long wanted to end the Fraternity&#x27;s policy of secrecy and rule the world openly. The Professor, Adam-One, and the Emperor favored secrecy for supervillains in order to get &quot;the loot without the leg-breaking&quot; and avoid gaining the attention of the larger multiverse, and have always managed to outvote Rictus and the Future. Though it seems that the Emperor is about to switch sides, the Professor subtly manipulates him to vote in favor of secrecy yet again.

After the meeting, the Professor leaves in a limo hoping to pick up a young prostitute. However, his driver is actually being impersonated by Shithead, Rictus&#x27;s right-hand man, and the Professor is murdered by him. Rictus and Future&#x27;s factions of the Fraternity begin a revolt against the other three. With most of the Professor&#x27;s supervillains killed, Wesley and Fox must fight off the rival factions on their own. They manage to kill off many of the rebel supervillains, including the Future. This culminates in an attack on their own headquarters, occupied by Rictus and his gang. Defeating Rictus and deflecting a bullet through his throat, Wesley demands to know who killed his father but Rictus refuses to answer (or is simply unable to) before he dies. A figure steps out of the shadows revealing himself to be Wesley&#x27;s father, the original Killer. The Killer reveals that he and Fox left Rictus&#x27;s chapter not because they objected to harming children but because they knew of his planned revolt. The Killer also says that his skills have been deteriorating with age and he does not want to be killed by anyone inferior to him. After Wesley&#x27;s training, the Killer believes that he is the only one worthy of ending his life and orders Wesley to put a bullet through his head. Afterwards, Wesley indicates that he wants to return to his former life and stop being a super villain. However, he reveals to Fox shortly after that he was just joking, and they go off to plan another heist. The comic ends with Wesley calling out the audience about their &quot;pathetic&quot; lives, and stating: &quot;This is my face while I&#x27;m fucking you in the ass.&quot;

<doc id="663079" wikidata="Q981237" url="?curid=663079" title="Xi'an Jiaotong University">
<text>Xi&#x27;an Jiaotong University (XJTU; ) is a public university in Xi&#x27;an, Shaanxi, China. It is affiliated with and funded by the Ministry of Education of China. The university is part of Project 211, Project 985, and the Double First-Class Construction. It is a member of the C9 League.

XJTU houses five state key laboratories, four state special laboratories, and two state engineering research centers. Two of its eight affiliated teaching hospitals are ranked among China&#x27;s top 100 hospitals. It is the hub of the University Alliance of the Silk Road, an international academic alliance under the umbrella of China&#x27;s Belt and Road Initiative that aims to build educational collaboration and fuel economic growth in countries along the Silk Road Economic Belt and key partners worldwide.

==History==

In 1896, the Nanyang Public School () was founded in Shanghai based on an imperial edict issued by the Guangxu Emperor, under the Business and Telegraphs Office of the imperial government. Four schools were established: a normal school, a school of foreign studies, a middle school, and a high school. Sheng Xuanhuai, the mandarin who proposed the idea to the Guangxu Emperor, became the first president and is regarded as the founder of the university, along with John Calvin Ferguson, a missionary educator.

The university underwent a series of transitions. In 1904, the Ministry of Commerce took over the school, and in 1905 changed its name to Imperial Polytechnic College of the Commerce Ministry. In 1906, the college was placed under the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs, and its name was changed to Shanghai Industrial College of the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs. When the Republic of China was founded, the college was placed under the Ministry of Communications and its name was once again changed, this time to Government Institute of Technology of the Communications Ministry.

The Republic of China founded the School of Management in 1918. In 1920, the Government Institute of Technology of the Communications Ministry merged with two other colleges and changed its name to Nan Yang College of Chiao Tung. In 1938, the Ministry of Education took over the university and renamed it, National Chiao Tung University (). During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the university moved to the French Concession, and in 1940 the state-run branch of Jiaotong University was set up in Chongqing. In 1941, to prevent the Wang puppet government from taking over the university, it continued operations under the name of Private Nanyang University. In 1942, the Wang government took over Shanghai School. So the Education Department of Guomin Government chose Chongqing Branch as the headquarters of Jiaotong University. In 1943, the graduate school was founded. After the anti-Japanese War was won, Chongqing headquarter went back to Shanghai and merged with Shanghai School. In 1946, the name of state-run Jiaotong University was recovered.

After the Kuomintang were defeated in 1949, a part of the faculty retreated to Taiwan with Chiang Kai-shek and, in 1958, formed the eponymous National Chiao Tung University in Taiwan. The institution that remained in Shanghai was renamed Chiao Tung University to reflect the fact that all universities under the new socialist state would be public. In the 1950s, the pinyin romanization system was developed in Mainland China and Chiao Tung University changed its English name to Jiao Tong University.
The national strategy adopted in 1956 dictated that the majority of Jiao Tong University would be moved to Xi&#x27;an, Shaanxi (). During the movement, the national strategy was changed and there were questions on necessity of the move. Since the majority of the facilities, staffs, faculties and students had already arrived in Xi&#x27;an and the campus had started operated, the university decided to operate two campuses, one in Xi&#x27;an and another in Shanghai. However, the operation with two campuses were difficult and moving the Xi&#x27;an campus back to Shanghai was impossible. Thus, from July 31, 1959, with the approval from State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, two campuses became independent. The Xi&#x27;an campus changed its name to Xi&#x27;an Jiaotong University and the Shanghai campus changed its name to Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Xi&#x27;an Jiaotong University was immediately listed as a National Key University. Later, it became one of a handful of universities built according to the &quot;Seventh Five-Year Plan&quot; and &quot;Eighth Five-Year Plan.&quot; In 2000, the State Council approved a merger of Xi&#x27;an Medical University and the Shaanxi Institute of Finance and Economics into Xi&#x27;an Jiaotong University.

Xi&#x27;an Jiaotong University has been part of all major government efforts to establish world-class universities in China, including Project 211, Project 985, the C9 League, and the Double First-Class Construction (Class A).

<text>Sleeper is a comic book series written by Ed Brubaker with art by Sean Phillips, published by DC Comics under their Wildstorm imprint. The series consisted of two twelve-issue limited series and the events of the first &quot;season&quot; served as a catalyst for the &quot;Coup d&#x27;etat&quot; line-wide crossover.

&quot;Sleeper&quot; was set in the Wildstorm Universe and concerned the travails of Holden Carver, a covert operative who has been placed undercover in a villainous organisation led by TAO, a WildC.A.T.s villain from Alan Moore&#x27;s run. It was a spin-off of &quot;Point Blank&quot;, a mini-series about Grifter from Wildcats and John Lynch from &quot;Gen13&quot; that was also written by Ed Brubaker.

==Plot==
Holden Carver, also known as The Conductor (although he prefers going by his real name), is placed undercover in Tao&#x27;s criminal organization by John Lynch, the director of International Operations after being fused with an alien artifact that makes him impervious to pain, gives him a powerful healing factor, and allows him to store pain he receives and pass it on to others through skin contact. Holden hates these abilities and constantly wishes to be rid of them. Lynch falls into a coma after being shot by Grifter, leaving Holden with no link to the outside world.

He quickly rises through the ranks of Tao&#x27;s syndicate and becomes one of his lieutenants, called &quot;Prodigals&quot;. He falls in love with another Prodigal named Miss Misery and befriends Genocide Jones, a super-strong, bullet-proof member of Tao&#x27;s organization. The series also focuses on Holden&#x27;s internal struggle over whether or not there is a difference between his actions while serving Tao and his actions while serving Lynch.

Tao learns of Holden&#x27;s true allegiance, and Holden is forced to live on the run. With the help of Peter Grimm, his most trusted Prodigal, Tao captures Holden and tells him that he is a survivor, past petty concepts like &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;. Beginning to believe Tao and seeing no other options, Holden rejoins Tao&#x27;s organization, this time as a true criminal. As Season One ends, John Lynch miraculously awakes from his coma.

Coup d&#x27;etat comes to pass and the members of Tao&#x27;s organization are forced into hiding so the Authority cannot discover them. Holden is now a full-fledged villain and a trusted Prodigal. While on a mission with his own band of Torpedoes (lower-level members of Tao&#x27;s organization) called the Hounds, consisting of the eager-to-please Pit Bull (introduced in Season One) and the werewolf Blackwolf, Holden is contacted by an agent of John Lynch. Lynch wants Holden to leave Tao and defect back to I.O. He later presents Holden with a member of the alien race who built the artifact that gave Holden his abilities and promises that if he agrees to come back he&#x27;ll rid him of his powers.

Holden then begins to play both sides against the middle, hoping he will be able to free himself of his obligations to Tao and Lynch and run away with Miss Misery. As this goes on, he tries to reform, despite knowing that he will never again be the man he thought he was before falling in with Tao.

At the end of Season Two, Holden Carver is left in a vegetative state. Lynch uses his gen factor powers to make the vegetative Holden believe that he is finally retired and living with Miss Misery and his ex-fiancée, Veronica St. James, on a tropical island. Holden ripped out Tao&#x27;s tongue as a last effort to &#x27;disarm&#x27; the main villain of the series before being handed over to Lynch. It is here that the story ends.

<text>Sean Phillips (born 27 January 1965) is a British comic book artist, best known for his collaborations with Ed Brubaker on comics including &quot;Sleeper&quot;, &quot;Incognito&quot;, the &quot;Criminal&quot; series of comics, &quot;Fatale&quot;, &quot;The Fade Out&quot;, and &quot;Kill or Be Killed&quot;.

He has also worked on the DC Comics&#x27; series &quot;WildC.A.T.s&quot; and &quot;Hellblazer&quot;.

== Early life ==
Phillips grew up in the U.K. fascinated by American comics, particularly those published by Marvel Comics. As he got older, his influences included Jim Baikie, Simon Bisley, Jamie Hewlett, Duncan Fegredo, Bill Sienkiewicz, Dave McKean, and Jaime Hernandez.

==Career==
Phillips began his career in 1980 in British girls&#x27; comic magazines such as &quot;Bunty&quot;, &quot;Judy&quot; and &quot;Nikki&quot; while still at school. After graduating art college (Lowestoft Polytechnic) in 1988 he started working with John Smith on &quot;New Statesmen&quot; and &quot;Straitgate&quot;, as well as Pat Mills on &quot;Third World War&quot;, both at &quot;Crisis&quot;. He was part of the British Invasion, getting work on &quot;Hellblazer&quot; before returning to the UK. There worked on &quot;Devlin Waugh&quot; for the &quot;Judge Dredd Megazine&quot;, and also provided the art on a number of series for &quot;2000 AD&quot;, including &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;.

In 1990, he illustrated the cover for the Stereo MC&#x27;s album &quot;Supernatural&quot;.

He returned to the American comic book industry in 2000 when he inked &quot;Scene of the Crime&quot; written by Ed Brubaker, a writer he would collaborate with a number of times over the following years. He moved on to Wildstorm for a long run on &quot;WildC.A.T.s&quot; with Joe Casey before teaming up Brubaker on &quot;Sleeper&quot;.

In 2001, Phillips and John Bolton illustrated a three-issue miniseries called &quot;User&quot;, written by Devin Grayson, and published by DC&#x27;s Vertigo imprint. The series explores &quot;sexual identity and online role-playing in the text-based MUDs of the nineties.&quot; &quot;User&quot; was re-released as a hardcover by Image in 2017.

Phillips went over to Marvel Comics in 2005 where he co-created &quot;Criminal&quot; with Brubaker at the Marvel imprint Icon Comics. He was also the main artist on the first two instalments of the Marvel Zombies series with Robert Kirkman.

Subsequent work includes &quot;Incognito&quot;, another series with Brubaker at Icon and a US reprint of &quot;7 Psychopaths&quot; at Boom! Studios.

Phillips provided the art for The Criterion Collection release of the 1961 noir film &quot;Blast of Silence&quot;, as well as the art for the Criterion release of the 1957 legal drama &quot;12 Angry Men&quot;, based on a design by Eric Skillman.

On 9 April 2011 Phillips was one of 62 comics creators who appeared at the IGN stage at the Kapow! Comic Convention in London to set two Guinness World Records, the Fastest Production of a Comic Book, and Most Contributors to a Comic Book. With Guinness officials on hand to monitor their progress, writer Mark Millar began work at 9 a.m. scripting a 20-page black and white &quot;Superior&quot; comic book, with Phillips and the other artists — including Dave Gibbons, Frank Quitely, John Romita Jr., Jock, Doug Braithwaite, Ian Churchill, Olivier Coipel, Duncan Fegredo, Simon Furman, David Lafuente, John McCrea, and Liam Sharp — all drawing a panel each, appearing on stage throughout the day to work on the pencils, inks, and lettering, with regular &quot;Superior&quot; artist Leinil Yu creating the book&#x27;s front cover. The book was completed in 11 hours, 19 minutes, and 38 seconds, and was published through Icon on 23 November 2011, with all royalties being donated to Yorkhill Children&#x27;s Foundation.

In 2012, Phillips was one of several artists to illustrate a variant cover for Robert Kirkman&#x27;s &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; No. 100, which was released 11 July at San Diego Comic-Con.

Phillips and Ed Brubaker launched their &quot;Fatale&quot; series at Image Comics in January 2012. The series was initially announced as a twelve-issue maxi-series but was upgraded to an ongoing title in November 2012. Jesse Schedeen of IGN stated that &quot;You can&#x27;t go wrong with a Brubaker/Phillips collaboration. Even so, &quot;Fatale&quot; is making a strong case for being the best of their projects.&quot;
In October 2013, Phillips and Brubaker signed a five-year contract to produce comics exclusively for Image. Under the terms of the deal, Image will publish any comic they bring to them without having to pitch it to them first. In 2019, Brubaker and Phillips signed another five-year contract with Image to produce comics exclusively for that publisher. As Phillips explained, &quot;[W]e get to do whatever we want! We don’t have to pitch projects to Image, we don’t have an editor or designer, we can make as many or few books as we want. We get to choose format, paper stock, and everything else to do with our books.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Phillips&#x27; son Jacob Phillips is also a professional comics creator, having worked as a colorist on his father&#x27;s comics and branching out into illustrating his own series.

== Art style ==
Phillips is known for the different art styles he has employed over the years, from clean-line superhero work, to scratchy, noir-inspired black-and-line work, to painted comics.

<text>Continental Aerospace Technologies is an aircraft engine manufacturer located at the Brookley Aeroplex in Mobile, Alabama, United States. It was originally spun off from automobile engine manufacturer Continental Motors Company in 1929 and owned by Teledyne Technologies from 1969 until December 2010. The company is now part of Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), which is a Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China state-owned aerospace company headquartered in Beijing.

Although Continental is most well known for its engines for light aircraft, it was also contracted to produce the air-cooled V-12 AV-1790-5B gasoline engine for the U.S. Army&#x27;s M47 Patton tank and the diesel AVDS-1790-2A and its derivatives for the M48, M60 Patton, and Merkava main battle tanks. The company also produced engines for various independent manufacturers of automobiles, tractors, and stationary equipment (pumps, generators, and machinery drives) from the 1920s to the 1960s.

==History==
In 1929, the company introduced its first aircraft engine, a seven-cylinder radial designated as the A-70, with a displacement of 543.91 cu in (8.91L) that produced . In August 1929, the Continental Motors Company formed the Continental Aircraft Engine Company as a subsidiary to develop and produce its aircraft engines.

As the Great Depression unwound, 1930 saw the company introduce the A-40 four-cylinder engine. A follow-on design, the A-50 was introduced in 1938 and was used to power the Taylor Cub and derivative Piper Cub. As the Second World War started in 1939 Continental commenced building aircraft engines for use in British and American tanks. Continental formed Continental Aviation and Engineering (CAE) in 1940 to develop and produce aircraft engines of over . Continental ranked 38th among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.

During the late 1930s, early 1940s the Gray Marine Motor Company adapted Continental engines for maritime use. On 14 June 1944 the company was purchased by Continental for US$2.6 million. John W. Mulford, the son of one of Gray&#x27;s founders was appointed general manager of Gray by Continental. Gray&#x27;s continued to make marine engines in the post-war period until its closure by Continental in about 1967.

During the 1950s, the A-65 was developed into the more powerful C-90 and eventually into the O-200. The O-200 powered a very important airplane design milestone: the Cessna 150. By the 1960s turbocharging and fuel injection arrived in general aviation and the company&#x27;s IO-520 series came to dominate the market.

In 1965, Ryan Aeronautical acquired a 50% stake in Continental Motors.

In 1969, Teledyne Incorporated acquired Continental Motors, which became Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM). That same year, the Continental Tiara series of high output engines were introduced, although they were dropped from the line after 1978. The company brought the TSIO-520-BE for the Piper PA-46 to market in 1984 and it set new efficiency standards for light aircraft piston engines. Powered by a liquid-cooled version of the IO-240, the Rutan Voyager was the first piston-powered aircraft to circumnavigate the world without refueling in 1986.

NASA selected Continental to develop and produce GAP in 1997, a new piston engine to operate on Jet-A fuel. This was in response to 100-octane aviation gasoline becoming less available as a result of decreased demand, due to smaller turboprop engines becoming more prevalent.

In 2008, Teledyne Continental&#x27;s new president, Rhett Ross announced that the company was very concerned about future availability of 100LL avgas and as a result would develop a diesel engine in the range for certification in 2009 or 2010. By the fall of 2009 the company was feeling the effects of the economic situation and the resulting reduced demand for aircraft engines. The company announced that it would close its plant for two one-week periods in October 2009 and January 2010. Salaried employees would move to a four-day work week with one week vacations for Thanksgiving and Christmas, with the aim &quot;to protect as much of our valuable employee base as possible&quot;.
On 14 December 2010, Continental&#x27;s parent Teledyne announced that Teledyne Continental Motors, Teledyne Mattituck Services, and its general aviation piston engine business would be sold to Technify Motor (USA) Ltd, a subsidiary of AVIC International, for US$186 million in cash. AVIC is a Chinese state-owned aerospace company. In May 2011, the transaction was reported as complete and the company renamed Continental Motors, Inc.

On 23 July 2013 the company bought diesel aircraft engine manufacturer Thielert from bankruptcy for an undisclosed sum. Thielert will become an operating division of Continental and will be renamed &quot;Technify Motors GmbH&quot;.

In 2015, Continental purchased Danbury Aerospace, which included ECi (Engine Components International) and PMA (Precision Machined Airparts). ECi had been supplying aftermarket engine parts since 1943; the merger reduced third-party manufacturers of Continental engine rebuild parts. ECi&#x27;s Titan engines were modern non-certified engines competing with Lycoming&#x27;s Thunderbolt. These were eventually rebranded as the Continental Titan.

In March 2019 the company name was changed from &quot;Continental Motors, Inc.&quot; to &quot;Continental Aerospace Technologies&quot;.

In March 2022, Karen Hong was named as the company&#x27;s president and CEO, replacing Robert Stoppek. Hong had previously served as the interim CEO and chief financial officer (CFO).

<doc id="663088" wikidata="Q2337912" url="?curid=663088" title="International adoption of South Korean children">
<text>The international adoption of South Korean children started around 1953 as a measure to take care of the large number of mixed children that became orphaned during and after the Korean War. It quickly evolved to include orphaned Korean children. Religious organizations in the United States, Australia, and many Western European nations slowly developed the apparatus that sustained international adoption as a socially integrated system.

From the 1970s through the 2000s, thousands of children were adopted overseas every year. Over time, the South Korean government has sought to decrease international adoptions in favor of domestic adoptions. In 2023, seventy years after its start, South Korea still sent 79 children overseas, making it the longest-running international adoption program in the world.

==Korean War and Holt==
===Korean War===

A 1988 article which was originally printed in &quot;The Progressive&quot; and was later reprinted in &quot;Pound Pup Legacy&quot; stated that less than one percent of Korean adoptees who are currently adopted are Amerasian, but during the decade after the Korean War, most of the Korean adoptees were Amerasians who were fathered by American soldiers.

Albert C. Gaw (1993) stated that 6,293 Koreans were adopted in the United States between 1955 and 1966, of whom about 46% were white and Korean mixed, 41% were fully Korean, and the rest were African-American and Korean mixed. The first wave of adopted people from Korea came from usually mixed-race children whose families lived in poverty; the children&#x27;s parents were often American military men and Korean women.

A 2015 article which was printed in &quot;Public Radio International&quot; stated that Arissa Oh who wrote a book about the beginnings of international adoption said that &quot;Koreans have this myth of racial purity; they wanted to get rid of these children. Originally international adoption was supposed to be this race-based evacuation.&quot;

===Holt===
The start of adoption in South Korea is usually credited to Harry Holt in 1955. Harry Holt wanted to help the children of South Korea, so Holt adopted eight children from South Korea and brought them home. In part due to the response that Holt got after adopting these eight children from the nationwide press coverage, Holt started Holt International Children&#x27;s Services, which is an adoption agency based in the United States which specialized in finding families for Korean children.

Touched by the fate of the orphans, Western religious groups as well as other associations started the process of placing children in homes in the United States and Europe. Adoption from South Korea began in 1955 when Bertha and Harry Holt went to Korea and adopted eight war orphans after passing a law through Congress. Their work resulted in the founding of Holt International Children&#x27;s Services. The first Korean babies sent to Europe went to Sweden via the Social Welfare Society in the mid-1960s. By the end of that decade, the Holt International Children&#x27;s Services began sending Korean orphans to Norway, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Switzerland, and Germany.

==Media coverage of adoption==
===South Korean media coverage===
In 1988, when South Korea hosted the 1988 Summer Olympics, the international adoption of South Korean children became the focus of global attention, and the issue became a source of national humiliation for South Korea. Politicians claimed that they would try to stop &quot;child exports&quot;, so they set an intended end date and a quota for international adoptions. However, the quota has been exceeded several times, and the intended end date has been extended several times.

Not until the 1980s and early 1990s did the South Korean government and South Koreans, both in South Korea and in the diaspora, pay any significant attention to the fates of Korean adoptees. The nation was not prepared for the return of their &#x27;lost children.&#x27; But the numerous adult Korean adoptees who visited Korea as tourists every year, in addition to raising public awareness of the Korean adoptee diaspora, forced Korea to face a shameful and largely unknown part of their history. South Korean president Kim Dae-jung invited 29 adult Korean adoptees from 8 countries to a personal meeting in the Blue House in October 1998. During this meeting he publicly apologized for South Korea&#x27;s inability to raise them.

Since then, South Korean media rather frequently reports on the issues regarding international adoption. Most Korean adoptees have taken on the citizenship of their adoptive country and no longer have Korean passports. Earlier they had to get a visa like any other foreigner if they wanted to visit or live in South Korea. This only added to the feeling that they were &quot;not really South Korean&quot;. In May 1999, a group of Korean adoptees living in Korea started a signature-collection in order to achieve legal recognition and acceptance (Schuhmacher, 1999). At present (2009) the number of Korean adoptees long-term residents in South Korea (mainly Seoul) is estimated at 500. It is not unlikely that this number will increase in the following decade (International adoption from South Korea peaked in the mid-1980s). A report from Global Overseas Adoptees&#x27; Link (G.O.A.&#x27;L) indicates that the long term returnees (more than one year) are predominantly in their early twenties or early thirties.

One factor that helped make the subject of Korean adoptees part of the South Korean discourse was a 1991 film called Susanne Brink&#x27;s Arirang which was a film about the life story of a Korean adoptee who grew up in Sweden. This film made the subject of the international adoptions of Korean children a hot topic in South Korea, and it made South Koreans feel shame and guilt regarding the issue.

A 1997 article in &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; said that Koreans in South Korea often believed that adoptive families in other countries had ulterior motives for adopting Korean orphans due to the Korean belief that parents can not love a child who is not their biological child. 
===North Korean media coverage===
A 1988 article which was originally in &quot;The Progressive&quot; and reprinted in &quot;Pound Pup Legacy&quot; said that the director general of South Korea&#x27;s Bureau of Family Affairs in the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs said that the large number of international adoptions out of South Korea had been an issue used as part of North Korea&#x27;s propaganda against South Korea in the 1970s. As part of North Korea&#x27;s propaganda against South Korea in the 1970s, North Korea decried the large numbers of international adoptions of South Korean children, and North Korea decried what it considered to be South Korea&#x27;s practice of selling South Korean children. The South Korean director general wanted to decrease the numbers of South Korean children being adopted internationally, so North Korea would no longer have the issue to use for its propaganda against South Korea. The news article also said that North Korea did not allow couples in other countries to adopt North Korean children.

The 1988 article was serialized by &quot;The People&#x27;s Korea&quot;, a pro-North Korea magazine, and the resulting publicity caused South Korea to have the image in the North as the number one child-exporting country of the world: &quot;The Pyongyang Times&quot;, a North Korean newspaper, printed: &quot;The traitors of South Korea, old hands at treacheries, are selling thousands, tens of thousands of children going ragged and hungry to foreign marauders under the name of &#x27;adopted children&#x27;.&quot;

==Korean patrilineal blood culture==

A 1988 article which was originally in &quot;The Progressive&quot; and reprinted in &quot;Pound Pup Legacy&quot; said that South Korean culture is a patrilineal culture that places importance on families related by blood. The importance of bloodline families is the reason why Koreans do not want to adopt Korean orphans, because the Korean adoptee would not be the blood relative of the adoptive parents. Korean patrilineal culture is the reason Korean society stigmatizes and discriminates against unwed Korean mothers and their kids, making it so the unwed mother might not be able to get a job or get a husband.

A 2007 doctoral dissertation by Sue-Je Lee Gage in the Department of Anthropology at Indiana University states that in Korean patrilineal blood culture, Koreanness is passed from parent to child as long as the parents have &quot;pure&quot; Korean blood, and this transference of Koreanness is especially notable when the Korean father gives his &quot;pure&quot; Korean blood to his Korean child, making lineage along the father&#x27;s line especially important in the Korean concept of race and identity. Gage said that a Korean family&#x27;s lineage history represents the official recording of their blood purity. Due to this conception of identity along blood lines and race, Gage said that Koreans in South Korea consider Korean adoptees who return to South Korea to still be Korean even if they cannot speak Korean. Gage said that, for Koreans, a Korean physical appearance is the most important consideration when identifying other people as being Koreans, although a Korean physical appearance is not the only consideration Koreans use in their consideration for group membership as a fellow Korean. For example, Gage said that Korean women who had sex with non-Korean men were often not considered to be &quot;Korean&quot; in the &quot;full-fledged&quot; sense by Koreans.

The Fall 2012 journal of &quot;The Journal of Korean Studies&quot; said that anthropologist Elise Prebin said that Korean adoptee reunions can be more secure and are easier maintained along the birth father&#x27;s line (patrilineal) than along the birth mother&#x27;s line (matrilineal) in her study of Korean adoptee reunions with birth families. The journal said that &quot;Korean patrilineal kinship ideologies&quot; still have a strong societal influence in South Korea.

A 2014 article in NPR said that unwed mothers suffer a social stigma in South Korea, because having a child out of wedlock is an act that goes against Korean patrilineal bloodline culture. The 2014 news article also said that Korean adoptees suffer a social stigma in South Korea, because Korean adoptees have been &quot;cut loose from their bloodlines&quot;.

A 2015 news article said that there is still a strong social stigma against unwed mothers and illegitimate children in South Korea. The 2015 news article said that this social stigma applies to the unwed mother and even her illegitimate children and her whole extended family, causing a child who was born out of wedlock to suffer lowered marital, job and educational prospects in South Korea.

A 2015 article in &quot;The Economist&quot; said that Koreans in South Korea mostly adopt female Korean children to avoid issues involving ancestral family rites which are usually done by bloodline sons and to avoid issues involving inheritance.

==Economics==
===Costs saved by South Korea===
A 1988 article which was originally in &quot;The Progressive&quot; and reprinted in &quot;Pound Pup Legacy&quot; said that the South Korean government made fifteen to twenty million dollars per year by the adoption of Korean orphans by families in other countries. The 1988 news article also said that the adoption of Korean orphans out of South Korea had three more effects: it saved the South Korean government the costs of caring for the Korean orphans, it relieved the South Korean government of the need to figure out what to do with the orphans and it lowered the population.

Some academics and researchers claim that the system for orphans Korean adoption agencies have established guarantee a steady supply of healthy children. Supporters of the system claim that adoption agencies are only caring for infants who would otherwise go homeless or be institutionalized.

Korean adoption agencies support pregnant-women&#x27;s homes; three of the four agencies run their own. One of the agencies has its own maternity hospital and does its own delivery. All four provide and subsidize child care. All pay foster mothers a monthly stipend to care for the infants, and the agencies provide all food, clothing and other supplies free of charge. They also support both independent-orphanages, and or self-run ones. The agencies will cover the costs of delivery and the medical care for any woman who gives up her baby for adoption (Rothschild, &quot;The Progressive&quot;, 1988; Schwekendiek, 2012).

A 2011 article in the Institute for Policy Studies estimated each adoption cost US$15k, paid primarily by the adopting parents. This generated an estimated US$35M/yr to cover foster-care, medical care, and other costs for the approximately 2,300 Korean international adoptions.

===Social welfare of South Korea===

In a 2010 book, Kim Rasmussen said that the &quot;root cause&quot; of the number of adoptions out of South Korea in 2010 was South Korea&#x27;s lack of spending on its social welfare system. Rasmussen said that the other OECD-30 countries spent an average of 20.6% of their GDP on social welfare benefits while South Korea only spent 6.9% of its GDP on social welfare benefits. Rasmussen said that South Korea promoting domestic adoption would not address the heart of the problem and that South Korea should raise its spending for social welfare benefits.

==Birth mothers and orphans==
===Birth mothers===

In the 1988 article which was originally in &quot;The Progressive&quot; and reprinted in &quot;Pound Pup Legacy&quot;, a South Korean orphanage director said that according to his orphanage&#x27;s questionnaire data 90% of Korean birth mothers indicated that wanted to keep their biological child and not give them up for adoption, but the South Korean orphanage director said that only maybe 10% of birth mothers eventually decided to keep their biological child after his orphanage suggested to the birth mothers that unwed mothers and poor couples should give their child up for adoption. The 1988 news article said that the Korean birth mothers felt guilty after giving their child up for adoption, and it said that most of the Korean birth mothers who gave their child up for adoption were poor and worked at factory or clerical jobs in South Korea.

In a same 1988 article, an INS officer at the Embassy of the United States, Seoul, said that social workers were hired by adoption agencies to perform the role of &quot;heavies&quot; to convince South Korean mothers to give their children up for adoption. Although the officer said that he felt that the adoption business was probably a good thing for birth mothers, adoptive parents and adoptees, he said that the adoption business troubled him due to the large number of children who were being adopted out of South Korea every month. The INS officer said that these numbers should make people question how much of the international adoption of South Korean children was a humanitarian cause and how much it was a business.

===Orphans===
A 2014 article in NPR said that it was &quot;effectively impossible&quot; for Korean orphans who aged out of institutions at 18 years old to attend a university in South Korea due to lacking the money to pay for all of the associated costs, so most Korean orphans ended up getting low-paying jobs in South Korean factories after aging out of the institutions. The 2014 news article said that many Korean parents in South Korea refuse to allow their children to marry Korean orphans.

A 2015 article said that the majority of South Korean orphans become orphans at a young age, and the 2015 article said that the majority of South Korean orphans eventually age out of the orphanages&#x27; care when they turn 18 years old never being adopted.

A 2015 article in &quot;The Economist&quot; said that in the past 60 years two million or about 85% of the total orphans in South Korea have grown up in South Korean orphanages never being adopted. The 2015 article said that from the 1950s to 2015 only 4% of the total number of orphans in South Korea had been adopted domestically by other Koreans in South Korea.

A 2015 video by BBC News said that orphanages in South Korea had become full as a result of the South Korean government making it more difficult for Korean orphans to be adopted overseas.

===Baby box===
In a video which was published on March 27, 2014, on the France 24 YouTube channel, Ross Oke, the international coordinator of Truth and Reconciliation for the Adoption Community of Korea (TRACK), said that baby boxes like the one in South Korea encourage abandonment of children and they deny the abandoned child the right to an identity.

A 2015 article in &quot;Special Broadcasting Service&quot; said that in 2009 South Korean pastor Lee Jong-rak put a &quot;baby box&quot; on his church in Seoul, South Korea, to allow people to anonymously abandon children. The article said that since the abandoned children have not been formally relinquished, they cannot be adopted internationally. The article said that the children will most likely stay in orphanages until they become 18 or 19 years old.

===Korean Adoption Services database===
A 2014 article in &quot;The Korea Herald&quot; said that the Korea Adoption Services was digitizing 35,000 documents regarding international adoptions that took place in South Korea since the 1950s to further the efforts of Korean adoptees locating their birth parents.

A 2017 article in &quot;The Hankyoreh&quot; said that Seo Jae-song and his wife who used to run the Seonggajeong orphanage in Deokjeokdo and later the St. Vincent Home in Bupyeong District had 1,073 Korean adoption records. In 2016, these 1,073 Korean adoption records were scanned by Korean Adoption Services (KAS) and the Ministry of Health and Welfare. In 2016, KAS had 39,000 records from 21 institutions.

==Korea&#x27;s domestic adoptions==
A 2015 article said that the South Korean government is trying to have more domestic adoptions due, in part, to people around the world becoming aware of the large number of Korean adoptees who were adopted by families outside of South Korea since the mid-1950s. Because the South Korean government does not want to have the reputation of a &quot;baby-exporting country&quot;, and due to the belief that Koreans should be raised with Korean culture, the South Korean government has been trying to increase domestic adoptions. However, this has been less than successful over the decades. The numbers only picked up after 2007.

However, the numbers of domestic adoption fell in 2013 due to tighter restrictions on eligibility for adoptive parents. The number in babies has also gone up with the forced registration of babies, also a new law, leading to more abandonment.

The primary reason as of 2015 for the majority of surrenders within South Korea is single mothers are still publicly shamed within Korea, and the South Korean mothers who give their kids up for adoption have been mostly middle or working-class women since the 1990s. The amount of money single mothers can receive within the country is 70,000 won per month, only after proving poverty versus the tax break from adopting domestically is 150,000 won per month, which is unconditional, whereas it&#x27;s conditional in the case of single mothers. 33 facilities for single and divorced mothers, but the majority of them are run by orphanages and adoption agencies.

In a 2009 article, Stephen C. Morrison, a Korean adoptee, said that he wanted more Koreans to be willing to adopt Korean children. Morrison said that he felt the practice of Koreans adopting Korean children in secret was the greatest obstacle for Korean acceptance of domestic adoption. Morrison also said that in order for domestic Korean adoption to be accepted by Koreans he felt that Korean people&#x27;s attitudes must change, so that Koreans show respect for Korean adoptees, not speak of Korean adoptees as &quot;exported items&quot; and not refer to Korean adoptees using unpleasant expressions of which Morrison gave the example, &quot;a thing picked up from under a bridge&quot;. Morrison said that he felt that the South Korean government should raise the allowable age at which Korean parents could adopt Korean orphans and raise the allowable age at which Korean orphans could be adopted by Korean parents, since both of these changes would allow for more domestic adoptions.

Even in its capacity as a global economy and OECD nation, Korea still sends children abroad for international adoption. The proportion of children leaving Korea for adoption amounted to about 1% of its live births for several years during the 1980s (Kane, 1993); currently, even with a large drop in the Korean birth rate to below 1.2 children per woman and an increasingly wealthy economy, about 0.5% (1 in 200) of Korean children are still sent to other countries every year.

A 2005 opinion piece in &quot;The Chosun Ilbo&quot; said that South Korean actress Shin Ae-ra and South Korean actor Cha In-pyo publicly adopted a Korean daughter after already having a biological son together, and the article said that by publicly adopting a Korean orphan this the couple could cause other Koreans to change their views about domestic adoptions in South Korea.

===Quota for overseas adoptions===
To stem the number of overseas adoptions, the South Korean government introduced a quota system for foreign adoptions in 1987. Under this system, the nation reduced the number of children permitted for overseas adoption by 3 to 5% each year, from about 8,000 in 1987 to 2,057 in 1997. The goal of the plan was to eliminate foreign adoptions by 2015. But in 1998 the government temporarily lifted the restrictions, after the number of abandoned children sharply increased in the wake of growing economic hardships.

Notable is a focused effort of the 2009 South Korean government to seize international adoption out of South Korea, with the establishment of KCare and the domestic Adoption Promotion Law.

===Incentivizing domestic adoptions===
A 1997 article in &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; said that South Korea was giving incentives in the form of housing, medical and educational subsidies to Korean couples who adopted Korean orphans to help encourage domestic adoption, but the Korean couples in South Korea who did adopt tended to not use these subsidies, because they did not want other Koreans knowing that their children were not their biological children.

===Special Adoption Law===
A 2013 article in CNN said that Jane Jeong Trenka who is a Korean adoptee along with others came up with the Special Adoption Law. The article said that the Special Adoption Law would make it so birth mothers have to stay with their child for seven days before giving it up for adoption. The article said that the Special Adoption Law would make it so the birth mothers&#x27; consent has to be verified before relinquishment of their child, and the article said that Special Adoption Law would make it so the birth of the child is registered. The article said that the Special Adoption Law would also make it so the birth mother could retract her relinquishment for up to six months following her application. The article said that Steve Choi Morrison who is a Korean adoptee and founder of Mission to Promote Adoption in Korea (MPAK) fought against the Special Adoption Law. The article said that Morrison was against the Special Adoption Law because Morrison said that Korean culture is a culture where saving face is important. The article said that Morrison said that Korean birth mothers would fear the record of the birth becoming known, and men will not marry them afterwards. The article said that Morrison predicted that forcing Korean birth mothers to register the births would lead to abandonments.

A 2015 article in the Washington International Law Journal suggested that the Special Adoption Act may have been a factor in more babies being abandoned after the enactment of the Special Adoption Act on August 5, 2012.

===Revised Special Adoption Act===
The Revised Special Adoption Act which was enacted in South Korea in 2012 made domestic adoptions in South Korea recorded as the biological children of the Korean adoptive parents.

A 2014 article in NPR said that the Revised Special Adoption Law did not make adopting Korean children equal to adding a blood relative in the minds of Koreans regardless of how domestic Korean adoptions would now be considered for legal purposes.

==Countries which Korean adoptees were sent to==

A 2010 book about Korean adoption said that there are Korean adoptee groups in cities that are in areas with many Korean adoptees residents such as in Stockholm, Copenhagen, Oslo, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Minneapolis, Seattle, Portland, Chicago, Boston, and Seoul.

===Adoptees in the United States===

An archived web page of the Bureau of Consular Affairs website that said that it was last updated in 2009 said that US couples who wanted to adopt Korean children needed to meet certain requirements. The web page said that the couples needed to be between 25 and 44 years old with an age difference between spouses of no more than 15 years, the couples needed to be married for three years, the couples needed to have an income higher than the US national average, and the couples could not already have more than five children. The web page said that US couples had to pay a fee between $9,500 and $10,000 to adopt a Korean child, and the web page said that it took one to four years after applying for the adopted Korean child to arrive in the United States. The web page said that the wait time after applying for US couples who wanted to adopt was about three years for a healthy Korean child and one year for a Korean child with special needs.

A 1988 article originally published in &quot;The Progressive&quot; and reprinted in &quot;Pound Pup Legacy&quot; said that there were 2,000,000 couples who wanted to adopt children in the United States, but only 20,000 healthy children were available for domestic adoption in the United States. The 1988 news article said that the lack of children for domestic adoption caused couples in the United States to look to other countries to adopt children, and the fastest increase of American couples&#x27; adoptions from other countries at this time was from South Korea.

A 2010 book about Korean adoption said that Korean adoptees comprise about ten percent of the total Korean American population according to an estimate in a 2010 book about South Korean adoption. The book said that, in the United States, the majority of Korean adoptees were adopted close to adoption agencies, so they were mostly adopted in the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Nebraska, Michigan, Montana, South Dakota, Oregon, Washington, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Vermont, Utah or Idaho.

===Adoptees in Sweden===
A 2002 article in the Embassy of Sweden, Seoul, said that due to the Swedish welfare state of the 1960s more Swedish families started adopting Korean children. The article said that the Swedish welfare system allowed for unwed Swedish mothers to better support themselves and not feel the need to give up their children for adoption. The article said that, as a consequence, there were fewer Swedish orphans in Sweden for domestic adoptions, so Swedish families who wanted to adopt children had to adopt from other countries. The article said that the reason for Korean adoptions, specifically, was that some Swedish families had already adopted Koreans in the 1950s, so later families continued this trend.

==Psychological effects==
===Perception of who the adoptees&#x27; &quot;real&quot; parents are===
In a 2016 study of 16 Korean American transnational adult adoptees, some of the Korean adoptees viewed their adoptive parents as their &quot;real&quot; parents and some viewed their biological parents as their &quot;real&quot; parents.

===Pronunciation of Korean===

A 2017 article in BBC News said that an article published in &quot;Royal Society Open Science&quot; said that Dutch-speaking Korean adoptees who were retrained in the Korean language were able to pronounce Korean better than expectations. Korean adoptees who were about 30 years old and who were adopted as babies to Dutch-speaking families were used in the study. The Korean adoptees were compared to a group of adults who had not been exposed to Korean as children. Following a short training course, the Korean adoptees were asked to pronounce Korean consonants for the study. The Korean adoptees did better than expectations after training.

===Sex work===

In her Ph.D. thesis, Sarah Y. Park cited Kendall (2005) and Kim (2007) when Park said that female Korean adoptees are commonly told that they may have become a prostitute if they were not adopted out of Korea.

===Social problems===
A 2002 study in &quot;The Lancet&quot; of intercountry adoptees in Sweden of various ethnic backgrounds, most of whom were of Korean, Colombian or Indian (from India) extraction, who were adopted by two parents who were born in Sweden found that intercountry adoptees had the following increased likelihoods relative to the rest of the children who were born in Sweden to two parents who were themselves also born in Sweden: intercountry adoptees were 3.6 times more likely to die from suicide, 3.6 times more likely to attempt suicide, 3.2 times more likely to be admitted for a psychological disorder, 5.2 times more likely to abuse drugs, 2.6 times more likely to abuse alcohol and 1.6 times more likely to commit a crime.

===Abandonment===

A 2006 article in New America Media said that an increasing number of South Korean parents were paying elderly American couples to adopt their children for the purpose of having their child receive US education and US citizenship. However, the article said that according to Peter Chang, who led the Korean Family Center in Los Angeles, Korean children who were put up for adoption for the purpose of receiving US education and US citizenship frequently felt betrayed by their biological parents. The article said that getting US citizenship this way required the adopted child to be adopted before their sixteenth birthday and stay with their adoptive family for at least two years.

In a 1999 study of 167 adult Korean adoptees by The Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute, the majority of the adult Korean adoptees struggled with the thought of how their birth mother could have given them up for adoption.

===Korean culture socialization===
A 2012 study in the Journal of Adolescent Research of Korean adoptees in the United States found that white parents of Korean adoptees whose average age was 17.8 years old tended to try to socialize their adopted Korean children to Korean culture by doing overt actions such as going to Korean restaurants or having them attend Korean culture camp rather than having conversations with them about Korean ethnic identity or being a racial minority in the United States. The study said that for many families doing these overt actions was easier and more comfortable for them than discussing the personal issues of ethnic identity or being a racial minority in the United States.

In a 2005 article, a 38-year-old Korean adoptee who was adopted in the United States said that social workers told her adoptive parents to not raise her with ties to South Korea, because the social workers said that doing that would confuse her. The 2005 article said that adoptive parents were no longer trying to cut ties with the culture of their adopted child&#x27;s birth country as of 2005, and adoptive parents were instead trying to introduce their adopted kid to the culture of their birth country. In 2005, one popular way for adoptive parents to expose their adopted child to the traditions and food of their birth country was for them to attend &quot;culture camps&quot; which would last for one day.

===Cross-race effect===
A 2005 study in American Psychological Society of the cross-race effect used Korean adoptees whose average age was 27.8 years old who were adopted when they were between 3 and 9 years old by French families and the study also used recent Korean immigrants to France. The study had the participants briefly see a photograph of a Caucasian or Japanese face, then the participants had to try to recognize the same Caucasian or Japanese face which they had just seen from a pair of either Caucasian or Japanese faces. The Korean adoptees and French people could recognize the Caucasian faces better than they could recognize the Japanese faces, but the recent Korean immigrants could recognize the Japanese faces better than they could recognize the Caucasian faces, suggesting that the cross-race effect can be modified based on familiarity with certain types of faces due to experiences starting after three years of age.

===Implicitly raised as white===
C. N. Le, a lecturer at the sociology department at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, said that Korean adoptees and non-white adoptees in general who are raised by white families are raised to implicitly think that they are white, but since they are not white, there is a disconnect between the way they are socialized at home and the way the rest of society sees them. Le further said that most white families of non-white adoptees are not comfortable talking with their adopted children about the issues that racial minorities face in the United States, and Le further advised white families who adopt transracially that just introducing their kids to Asian culture, telling them that race is not important and/or telling them that people should get equal treatment in society is insufficient. Le said that the social disconnection between how they were raised and the reality of American society causes &quot;confusion, resentment about their situation, and anger&quot; for adoptees who were transracially adopted by white families.

Many of the South Korean children adopted internationally grew up in white, upper or middle-class homes. In the beginning adoptive families were often told by agencies and social workers to assimilate their children and make them as much as possible a part of the new culture, thinking that this would override concerns about ethnic identity and origin. Many Korean adoptees grew up not knowing about other children like themselves. This has changed in recent years with social services now encouraging parents and using home studies to encourage prospective adoptive parents to learn about the cultural influences of the country. With such works as &quot;Beyond Culture Camp&quot; which encourage the teaching of culture, there has been a large shift. Though, these materials may be given, not everyone may take advantage of them. Also, adoption agencies started to allow the adoption of South Koreans by people of color in the late 1990s to early 2000, and not just white people, including Korean-Americans. Such an example of this is the rapper GOWE, who was adopted by a Chinese-American family.

As a result of many internationally adopted Korean adoptees growing up in white areas, many of these adoptees avoided other Asians in childhood and adolescence out of an unfamiliarity and/or discomfort with Asian cultures. These adoptees sometimes express a desire to be white like their families and peers, and strongly identify with white society. As a result, meeting South Koreans and Korean culture might have been a traumatic experience for some. However, other Korean adoptees, often those raised in racially or culturally diverse communities, grew up with ties to the Korean community and identify more strongly with the Korean aspect of their identities. 

===Adoptees&#x27; feelings about South Korea===
In a 1999 study of 167 adult Korean adoptees by The Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute, group discussions about the topic of how they felt about South Korea led to many feelings. There was anger about the negative way Koreans view adopted Koreans. There was concern over Korean orphans in South Korean orphanages, and there was a feeling of obligation to help the Korean orphans who remained in the South Korean orphanages. There was a feeling of responsibility to change Koreans&#x27; views of domestic adoption, so that adopting an orphan in South Korea would not be something that Koreans in South Korea would be ashamed of doing.

===Adoptees&#x27; memories of orphanages and initial adoption===
In a 1999 study of 167 adult Korean adoptees by The Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute, there were adoptees who mainly remembered experiencing poverty as orphans such as one adoptee who remembered eating much oatmeal with flies in it as an orphan in South Korea. Some adoptees remembered feeling a sense of loss of the relationships that they had with people when they left their South Korean orphanages. Some of the adoptees remembered being scared of their new living situation with adoptive parents in a new country when they had just been adopted out of South Korea.

==Discrimination==
===Discrimination for being adopted===
A 2014 article in NPR said that Koreans in South Korea were prejudiced against Korean adoptees, and the 2014 news article said that Korean adoptees who were adopted domestically by other Koreans in South Korea often became outcast and bullied by other Koreans at their South Korean school.

===Discrimination for race and appearance===
In a 1999 study of 167 adult Korean adoptees by The Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute, the majority of respondents (70%) reported their race being the reason they were discriminated against while growing up, and a minority of respondents (28%) reported their adoptee status as being the reason they were discriminated against while growing up. One of the study&#x27;s respondents said that growing up in a small town of white people made him an oddity that few people wanted to associated with, and he said that he had wanted to be like other people instead of being different. Other respondents said that the discrimination they received growing up caused them to deny their Korean heritage.

In a 2010 book, Kim Rasmussen gave an example of a Korean adoptee from the United States who returned to South Korea and tried to apply for the job of an English teacher in South Korea only to be denied the job due to her race. The Korean adoptee was told that she was rejected for the job, because the mothers of the students wanted their children to be taught English from a white person.

In a 2015 article in The Straits Times, Korean adoptee Simone Huits who was adopted to a Dutch family in the Netherlands made the following remark about growing up in a small Dutch town, &quot;All the children wanted to touch me because I looked different. It was scary and overwhelming.&quot;

===Discrimination for not speaking Korean===
In a 1999 study of 167 adult Korean adoptees by The Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute, the majority of respondents (72%) reported that they had no ability with the Korean language, and only a minority of respondents (25%) reported that they had any ability with the Korean language. Of the study&#x27;s respondents who visited South Korea, 22% described their visit as a negative experience, and about 20% described their visit as a both negative and positive experience. Inability to speak Korean was mentioned as being a cause of their visit being a negative experience by more than one respondent, and inability to speak Korean was generally the cause of the negative parts of the visit for the respondents who reported both a positive and negative experience. One respondent said that they felt that Koreans in South Korea looked down on them for their inability to speak Korean. Another respondent said that the Koreans in South Korea were initially nice to them, but the respondent said that Koreans in South Korea became rude to them after finding out that they could not speak Korean. Many of the adoptees felt like they were foreigners while visiting South Korea.

A 2007 book about Korean adoption said that it was uncomfortable for Korean adoptees who do not speak Korean and who do not have Korean last names to associate with Korean-speaking children of Korean immigrants in school districts with children of Korean immigrant families.

==Korean adoptee camps==

===Holt adoptee camps===
Holt adoptee camps are places where transracial and/or international adoptees can talk about feelings of not fitting in and isolation in a safe space. Each day there are group discussions about issues of identity, adoption and questions regarding race that last about an hour. The locations of the camps are Corbett, Oregon; Williams Bay, Wisconsin; Ashland, Nebraska and Sussex, New Jersey.

===Camp Moo Gung Hwa===
Camp Moo Gung Hwa is a Korean culture camp for Korean adoptees in Raleigh, North Carolina. The camp first started in 1995 with the name Camp Hodori, and the camp changed its name to Camp Moo Gung Hwa in 1996. The purpose of the camp is to improve the Korean adoptees&#x27; knowledge of Korean culture and improve their self-esteem.

===Korean Adoption Means Pride===
Korean Adoption Means Pride (KAMP) is a camp in Dayton, Iowa for Korean adoptees and their families. The camp exposes camp attendees to Korean culture. Korean culture classes cover Korean cuisine, Korean dance, Korean language, taekwondo and Korean arts and crafts.

=== Heritage Camps for Adoptive Families ===
Heritage Camps for Adoptive Families (HCAF) was founded in 1991 and consists of nine different camps for varying adoptee groups, one of which is Korean Heritage Camp. KHC is held annually at Snow Mountain Ranch in Fraser, Colorado. It brings adoptees and their families together each year to learn about adoption and Korean culture.

=== Sae Jong Camp ===
Founded in 1976, Sae Jong Camp is an overnight Korean American summer camp held each year in Roscommon, Michigan for Korean children entering third grade to twelfth grade. Each day, campers participate in Korean language, culture and identity classes, alongside a mix of traditional camp activities, such as archery, canoeing and swimming, and Korean electives, including Korean cooking and Korean crafts. Sae Jong Camp is the nation’s oldest continuously running Korean-American summer camp.

==Adoptees returning to South Korea==
===Adoptees visiting South Korea===
In a 1999 study of 167 adult Korean adoptees by The Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute, most of the adult Korean adoptees felt that younger Korean adoptees should visit South Korea, 57% of the 167 adult Korean adoptees reported that they have visited South Korea and 38% of the 167 adult Korean adoptees reported visiting South Korea as a means with which they explored their Korean heritage.

Eleana J. Kim, Assistant Professor of Anthropology at the University of Rochester, said that South Korea developed programs for adult Korean adoptees to return to South Korea and learn about what it means to be Korean; these programs included wearing hanboks and learning to make kimchi.

===Adoptees returning to live in South Korea===
When International Korean Adoptees turned into adults, many of them chose to return. These countries include Sweden, United States of America, the Netherlands, France, and Belgium. In this respect the so-called re-Koreanization of the Korean adoptees is often reproduced in South Korean popular media (e.g. the blockbuster &quot;Kuk&#x27;ka Taep&#x27;yo/National Representative/Take Off&quot;). The &#x27;re-Koreanization&#x27; can be reflected in Korean ethnic based nationalism (both north and south of the 38th parallel).

A 2005 article in &quot;Hyphen: Asian America Unabridged&quot; said that an increasing number adoptees were moving back to live in South Korea to try to help other Korean adoptees, and it said that many of these returning Korean adoptees were critical of South Korea&#x27;s adoption system. The article said that one returning Korean adoptee, for example, made a confrontational exhibition where he posted photos of 3,000 Korean adoptees in South Korea&#x27;s three largest cities with the hope that South Koreans would see these photos and question why South Korea was still sending many Korean children abroad as adoptees. The article said that another returning Korean adoptee created an organization based in South Korea called Adoptee Solidarity Korea (ASK) to end the international adoption of South Korean orphans, and the article said that ASK intended to accomplish this goal by &quot;preventing teenage pregnancy through sex education, monitoring orphanages and foster care, increasing domestic adoption and expanding welfare programs for single mothers.&quot; The article said that other Korean adoptees who returned to live in South Korea did volunteer work in orphanages.

The article went on to say Korean adoptees who return to live in South Korea choose to use a Korean name, their adopted name or a combination of both while living in South Korea. The article said that one returning adoptee said that they chose to use a combination of both names to indicate their status as a Korean adoptee. The article said that another returning Korean adoptee chose to use a Korean name, but the name they decided to go by was one that they chose for themselves and not the Korean name which was originally assigned to them by their orphanage when they were an orphan. The article said that another returning Korean adoptee decided to go by their original Korean name over their adopted Belgian name, because their Belgian name was difficult for other people to pronounce.

The article also claimed that Korean adoptees who return to live in South Korea from the United States generally hold higher paying jobs in South Korea that involve speaking English and teaching while Korean adoptees who return to live in South Korea from European countries that use other languages generally get involved with lower paying jobs in restaurants, bars and stores while living in South Korea.

A 2015 article in &quot;The Washington Times&quot; said that mixed-race Korean adoptee Thomas Park Clement who was born during the middle of the Korean War remembered being abandoned by his birth mother when he was four and half years old after Clement&#x27;s birth mother told him to walk down a street and not turn around. Clement lived on the streets before being put in an orphanage. Two years after, Clement was adopted by a family in North Carolina. Clement later received a degree in electrical engineering from Purdue University, and Clement founded Mectra Labs, a medical device company, in 1988. Clement was not planning on looking for his birth mother.

A 2013 article in &quot;The Berkshire Eagle&quot; said that Clement&#x27;s 2012 biography was called &quot;Dust of the Streets: The Journey of a Biracial Orphan of the Korean War&quot;.

A 2016 article in &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; said that Korean adoptee Thomas Park Clement founded Mectra Labs which is a medical-manufacturing company, and it said that Clement has pledged $1,000,000 worth of DNA testing kits for donation. Clement has given 2,550 DNA testing kits to Korean adoptees and Korean War veterans, and he has given 450 DNA testing kits to 325Kamra which is a volunteer organization to give to people in South Korea. Clement said, &quot;I have throughout the years experienced so many of my fellow Korean adoptees&#x27; frustrations with birth-relative searches&quot;, and Clement said, &quot;DNA is shortcutting the search process and bringing all parties in direct communication with each other.&quot;

A 2015 article on the Public Radio International website said that Clement was paying for the DNA kits from 23andMe.

===Adam Crapser===
A 2016 article on the Q13 Fox website said that Immigration Judge John O&#x27;Dell chose to deport Adam Crapser, a Korean adoptee who was not a US citizen, due to Crapser&#x27;s criminal record.

===Kyung Eun Davidson===
A 2016 article in &quot;The Korea Herald&quot; covered the story of Korean adoptee Kyung Eun Davidson. The article said that Davidson was a Korean adoptee who was given up for adoption when she was three years old by her birth father. Davidson grew up in Oregon after being adopted. Davidson was in Korea from 2005 to 2007 to find her birth mother. Davidson reunited with her birth father in 2007, but after their first reunion he disappeared. Davidson went back to the United States from Korea in 2007. Davidson&#x27;s birth father had lied to her birth mother that he had been raising her for more than twenty years when in reality he had put her up for adoption. Davidson&#x27;s birth mother went to Holt in 2008 after Davidson&#x27;s birth mother found out about her biological daughter being put up for adoption by Davidson&#x27;s birth father. Davidson became aware that her birth mother did not relinquish her for adoption in 2016. Davidson found her birth mother through a DNA match, and Davidson and her birth mother were going to meet each other in person.

===Amy Davis===
A 2017 article in the &quot;Duluth News Tribune&quot; covered the story of Korean adoptee Amy Davis. Davis was adopted in the 1970s, and Davis grew up in Cloquet, Minnesota, in a community of mostly white people. Davis&#x27;s adoptive parents were told that Davis had been abandoned, so there was no way to contact Davis&#x27;s birth parents. In 2016, Davis went to Korea to search for her birth parents, and Davis&#x27;s case manager told Davis that her biological aunt had been looking for her seven years ago. Davis&#x27;s case manager originally did not tell Davis the name of her biological aunt, because it was against Korea&#x27;s privacy laws for the case manager to tell Davis this information, but the case manager eventually broke the law and told Davis the information. Davis found her biological aunt, and Davis found her birth father who was proven to be her birth father through DNA testing. Davis&#x27;s birth parents had split up when Davis was one year old, and Davis&#x27;s birth father had been leaving Davis with his mother (Davis&#x27;s biological grandmother) while Davis&#x27;s birth father went to work. Davis had long thought that she was abandoned in a police station, but, in reality, it was her biological grandmother who had put her up for adoption without her birth parents&#x27; consent or awareness, and this act had caused her birth family to become estranged. Davis&#x27;s 97-year-old biological grandmother asked for forgiveness for what she had done to Davis, and Davis forgave her.

===Karen Hae Soon Eckert===
A 2000 article on the PBS website covered the story of Korean adoptee Karen Hae Soon Eckert. Eckert was discovered at a police station in Seoul on February 21, 1971, with no accompanying written information left with her. Because she had no written information left with her, she was given the name Park Hae-soon. Officials estimated Eckert&#x27;s birthday to be February 12, 1971, because they said that she looked about 10 days old. Eckert was in a hospital for four months after she was born before being put in Holt International&#x27;s foster care. When Eckert was 9 months old, she was adopted, and she grew up in Danville, California. Eckert&#x27;s brothers and parents were white people. Five years after she was eighteen years old, Eckert joined a group of adult adoptees. Eckert liked encountering other adoptees, she liked sharing experiences and she liked being able to empathize.

===Layne Fostervold===
A 2017 article on the PRI website covered the story of Korean adoptee Layne Fostervold. Fostervold&#x27;s birth mother, Kim Sook-nyeon, was unwed when she became pregnant with Fostervold in 1971, and Kim Sook-nyeon&#x27;s family would have encountered a lot of stigma and prejudice if she had kept Fostervold. Fostervold was adopted when he was 2 years old, and Fostervold grew up in Willmar, Minnesota. Fostervold said that he had the feeling for almost all of his life that his birth mother did not want to give him up for adoption. Kim Sook-nyeon said that she had to promise not to go looking for Fostervold in the future. Kim Sook-nyeon said that she had prayed for Fostervold, worried about Fostervold and wanted Fostervold to have a good life. Fostervold went to Korea in 2012, and he talked to Korea Social Service (KSS) which was the agency which had done his adoption. A social worker for KSS told Fostervold that a person who claimed to be his birth mother looked for him in 1991 and 1998, but nobody from KSS had told his adoptive family this information. Fostervold reunited with his birth mother. Fostervold moved to South Korea in 2016, and Fostervold was living with his birth mother in 2017. Fostervold was trying to learn the Korean language in order to obtain a professional job, and Fostervold changed his last name from Fostervold back to Kim on social media.

===Steven Haruch===
A 2000 article on the PBS website covered the story of Korean adoptee Steven Haruch.

===Shannon Heit===
A 2014 article in &quot;MinnPost&quot; covered the story of Korean adoptee Shannon Heit. Heit was on &quot;K-pop Star&quot; in 2008 for the purpose of trying to find her birth mother who she believed had given her up for adoption more than twenty years ago. Heit&#x27;s appearance on TV and Heit&#x27;s singing ability led to her being reunited with her birth mother. Heit learned that she had been put up for adoption by her biological grandmother when her birth mother was away working which was contrary to the story her adoptive family had been told. Heit was supportive of the Special Adoption Law which went into effect in August 2012. In 2014, Heit was living in South Korea, was married and was working as an editor and translator. Also in 2014, Heit was working with civic groups to help unwed mothers and she was counseling adopted children. Heit remained in contact with her adoptive parents in the United States, and Heit said, &quot;my case shows how traumatic adoption can be, even when the adoptive parents are loving and have the best intentions.&quot;

=== Sara Jones ===
Born in South Korea in the 1970s, Sara&#x27;s father made the tough decision to place her in an orphanage in order to ensure she received the care she deserved. Prior to placing her in the orphanage, her father gave each member of his family a special tattoo.

At the age of 3, Sara was adopted by a white family from Utah, USA. Her new parents relocated her to Utah, gave her a new name, and had her mysterious tattoo removed. She was then raised as the only minority in a predominantly white community. As a result of her upbringing, Sara identified more with being a White female than an Asian female. Sara went on to graduate with honors from The University of Utah with a B.S. in chemical engineering, graduate cum laude from Brigham Young University, become a female CEO, and co-founded the Women&#x27;s Tech Council.

Despite her success, Sara yearned to find her birth family and embrace her Asian heritage. She used modern resources and her mysterious tattoo to begin the search for her birth family. 42 years after she was adopted, Sara was reunited with her birth family. She now uses her unique experience of being a Korean adoptee, growing up a minority in a predominately white community, reuniting with her birth family, and being a female leader working in a field dominated by white males to help others. Most recently, she was featured by Ted.com for her 2019 TedxSaltLakeCity talk entitled &quot;My Story of Love and Loss as a Transracial Adoptee&quot;.

Sara is currently the CEO of InclusionPro, a consulting firm specializing in helping organizations create inclusive work environments. She has keynoted the Silicone Slopes Tech Summit as well as being featured in numerous articles, publications, and podcasts. As a result of her work, Sara received a Distinguished Alumna award from the University of Utah College of Engineering. Other awards she has received include CEO of the year, being honored as a Women to Watch, and receiving the Utah Innovation award.

===Dong-hwa Kim===
A 2017 article in &quot;Korea JoongAng Daily&quot; covered the story of Korean adoptee Kim Dong-hwa. The article said that Kim and his birth sister were abandoned by their birth mother when they were both infants. Kim and his birth sister flew out of South Korea in 1979. The two were adopted to a family in Portland, Oregon, and Kim said that it lasted for about a year. Kim and his sister were then sent to a foster family in Denver, Colorado, for about five years, and that family was busted for physical abuse of children. Kim and his sister were then put in foster care. In 1986, Kim and his sister were put into a foster family with foster parents of Mexican descent who were undocumented immigrants in East Los Angeles, California. Kim said that this new foster family beat him and his sister, and Kim said that they beat him with big sticks. Kim said that he had a feeling that his sister was being sexually abused, because Kim said that &quot;She started doing weird things, so... you know&quot;. Kim got two years in juvenile detention after hitting his foster father in the head with a hammer after Kim heard neighbors praising the foster father. Kim was later convicted of assault, gang affiliation and possession of a firearm which got Kim five years in jail, and Kim was charged with assault with a deadly weapon three years into this five-year jail term. Kim&#x27;s lawyer suggested to Kim that he could avoid jail time by accepting lifetime deportation, since the paper work was never completed for Kim to become a US citizen. Kim said, &quot;I just didn&#x27;t want to sit in jail&quot;, and Kim went to South Korea. In South Korea, Kim taught English before starting a Mexican restaurant with another person with the help of loans.

===Dan Matthews===
A 2016 documentary on &quot;NBC News&quot; covered the story of Korean adoptee Dan Matthews who is an alternative rapper.

===Madoc Hyunsu O&#x27;Callaghan===
A 2016 article in WUSA 9 covered the story of Korean adoptee Madoc Hyunsu O&#x27;Callaghan. The article said that O&#x27;Callaghan who was three years old was killed by his adoptive father, Brian O&#x27;Callaghan, after only having been adopted for three months when his adoptive father threw him against the wall. The lawyer for the adoptive father argued that his Marine Corps veteran client had PTSD which caused him to go into a rage and lose control. Korean adoptee Annalie Yi felt that the adoptive father&#x27;s prison sentence which made it so he could be released from prison after only four years was a &quot;slap on the wrist&quot;. The Korean adoptee community was upset that O&#x27;Callaghan&#x27;s grave had just a marker with his name over it rather than a headstone over it, and the Korean adoptee community offered to buy a headstone for O&#x27;Callaghan&#x27;s grave, but the Korean adoptee community has now accepted the adoptive mother&#x27;s statement that she was going to move the body.

A 2016 article in DCW 50 said that Brian O&#x27;Callaghan got 12 years in prison with eligibility for parole in around 5 years.

A 2016 article in The Washington Post said that Circuit Judge John Debelius was in agreement that the adoptive father&#x27;s PTSD was a factor in the death of O&#x27;Callaghan, and Debelius said that he did not believe that O&#x27;Callaghan&#x27;s death was a premeditated killing by his adoptive father.

A 2015 article in 89.3KPCC covered the story of Korean adoptee Nicky Sa-eun Schildkraut. Schildkraut&#x27;s precise age at adoption was not known, and she grew up near Boston in the United States. Schildkraut went to South Korea two times to try to find information about her birth family. Schildkraut said, &quot;The fact that I&#x27;ll never be able to find my biological family and relatives. I feel like that kind of loss is interminable, it&#x27;s just ongoing loss.&quot; Schildkraut said, &quot;I have all these privileges growing up in my westernized family, all my education and degrees I would not be able to have if I had still been in Korea, so I feel fortunate in that sense.&quot;

===Brooke Thiele===
A 2017 article in the &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot; covered the story of Korean adoptee Brooke Thiele. Thiele was born in Daegu, and she was adopted when she was 9 months old to a white family in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Thiele was awarded a Mary L. Nohl Fellowship grant of $10,000 to work on her project about interracial adoption.

===Veronica Thompson===
A 2017 article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; covered the story of Korean adoptee Veronica Thompson. In 1974, Thompson was discovered all by herself in a bag outside of a South Korean police station. Thompson has twice tried to find out about her origins and both of these attempts were unsuccessful. Thompson was going to perform a solo show called &quot;Flights of Fancy&quot; at the Soho Theatre. Flights of Fancy was about imaginary talks with Thompson&#x27;s birth mother, and Flights of Fancy was about Thompson&#x27;s journey from the police station, continuing to adoption and a childhood in a town near Seattle with a white family and coming to the United Kingdom in the early 2000s. &quot;Flights of Fancy&quot; delved into identity politics, migration and belongingness.

===Jane Jeong Trenka===

A 2010 article in &quot;MinnPost&quot; said that Korean adoptee Jane Jeong Trenka was concerned that children adopted from Haiti, only a month after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, could be trafficked, misidentified or removed from adults who could care for them.

== Kidnapping and fraud ==
Many Korean children were kidnapped or adopted without the consent of their parents. Several governments engaged in &quot;existence of illicit practices of a systemic nature&quot;, including falsifying documents. This was to meet the demand for children in western countries. Adoption agencies charged $9,000 or $12,000 to &quot;order&quot; a child. Many children experienced abuse after being adopted, and are twice as likely to encounter the psychiatric system as other adoptees. The South Korean government stopped adoptions to Sweden, Denmark and Norway but continued after they made sent diplomats to make 9 requests for more children. Adoptions were approved to &quot;promote international friendships&quot; between the ROK and other countries.

== In popular culture ==
Korean adoptees to the USA are a common component of South Korean television series. The adoptees depicted are generally born of two Korean parents, speak Korean, and are successful in the United States. Examples of this include &quot;You Are My Destiny&quot; (character: Daniel Pitt) and &quot;Her Private Life&quot; (character: Ryan Gold).

&quot;Blue Bayou&quot;, a film written and directed by Justin Chon, depicts a Korean-American man who was adopted by a white family and is at risk for deportation because his parents did not file for his citizenship. The movie is based on true stories about interracial adoption, which is related to the Child Citizenship Act of 2000.

<doc id="663096" wikidata="Q16996114" url="?curid=663096" title="Legal consequences of marriage and civil partnership in England and Wales">
<text>This is a list of legal consequences of forming a [[marriage]] or [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|civil partnership]] in England and Wales.

*For the purposes of capital gains tax, a married couple and civil partners can claim private residence relief for only one dwelling, even if they live apart.
*Married couples and civil partners can possess joint property without needing to agree a contract.
*A spouse of a British citizen is entitled to a residence permit if the spouse is from the EU. If not, to apply for residence the British spouse must meet a minimum income requirement.
*A person may not be compelled by a criminal court to disclose private communications with their spouse.
*When a married couple or civil partners separate, the courts have wide powers to divide their property and may set aside prenuptial agreements.
*Wills are revoked on marriage or formation of a civil partnership (unless made in contemplation of marriage/formation of a civil partnership). Similarly, a divorced former spouse cannot benefit from a will made before divorce/dissolution.
*No inheritance tax is payable on an estate inherited by a surviving spouse or civil partner, if they are UK domiciled.
*The surviving spouse inherits part or all of the estate of a spouse who dies intestate. The rules around intestacy are different in the countries of the UK. In England and Wales, if there are children, the survivor inherits the first £125,000 plus personal possessions plus a life interest in half the remainder; if there are no children but the deceased has surviving parents or siblings, the surviving spouse inherits the first £200,000 plus personal possessions plus half the remainder; otherwise the survivor inherits the whole estate.
*The surviving spouse is paid a proportion of their deceased spouse&#x27;s pension. The exact amount has been a subject of legal challenge following the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013: same-sex couples are only entitled to pass on a proportion of their pension since the 2005 introduction of civil partnerships, considerably lowering the amount of pension provision they could pass on in the event of their death, compared to the position if they had been married to an opposite-sex partner. A legal challenge to change this failed in 2015.
*Women who become spouses to male peers and knights usually receive titles which last for the length of a marriage. Men who are married to women who are made dames do not receive titles. In the case of same-sex partnerships, whether civil partnerships or marriages, the male spouse of an ennobled man does not get any title—nor would the female partner of a similarly ennobled woman. David Furnish, the husband of Sir Elton John, has argued that there remains a legal inequality on this matter.

<doc id="663102" wikidata="Q332357" url="?curid=663102" title="Mark Steyn">
<text>Mark Steyn (; born December 8, 1959) is a Canadian author and a radio, television, and on-line presenter. He has written several books, including &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestsellers &quot;America Alone&quot;, &quot;After America&quot;, and &quot;Broadway Babies Say Goodnight&quot;. In the US he has guest-hosted the nationally syndicated &quot;Rush Limbaugh Show&quot;, as well as &quot;Tucker Carlson Tonight&quot; on Fox News, on which he regularly appeared as a guest and fill-in host.

In 2021, Steyn began hosting his own show on British news channel GB News. He left GB News in early February 2023, saying that the channel wanted him to pay fines issued by the UK media regulator Ofcom, which was investigating complaints of COVID-19 vaccination scepticism aired on &quot;The Mark Steyn Show&quot;. He has since moved his show to his own website.

==Early life==
Steyn was baptized a Catholic and was later confirmed in the Anglican Church, which he left to become a Baptist. He has stated that &quot;the last Jewish female in my line was one of my paternal great-grandmothers&quot; and that &quot;both my grandmothers were Catholic&quot;. His parents were married in Elliot Lake, Ontario. Steyn&#x27;s great-aunt was artist Stella Steyn. His mother&#x27;s family was Belgian.

Steyn was educated at King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham, in the United Kingdom, the same school that author J.R.R. Tolkien attended and where Steyn was assigned a Greek dictionary that had also been used by Tolkien. Although it was reported by &quot;The Age&quot; in 2006 that Steyn had left school at age 16, his name appears in the King Edward&#x27;s School yearbook for 1977-78 as a member of &quot;Cl.VI&quot;, that is, the &quot;Classics [Upper] 6th form&quot;, which is the normal final year for students at that school.

==Career==
Steyn worked as a disc jockey before becoming musical theatre critic at the newly established &quot;The Independent&quot; in 1986. He acted as TV critic for Channel 4&#x27;s breakfast show The Channel 4 Daily and was appointed film critic for &quot;The Spectator&quot; in 1992. After writing predominantly about the arts, Steyn shifted his focus to political commentary and wrote a column for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, a conservative broadsheet, until 2006.

He has written for many publications, including &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;, &quot;Orange County Register&quot;, &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, &quot;National Review&quot;, &quot;The New York Sun&quot;, &quot;The Australian&quot;, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, &quot;National Post&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, &quot;Western Standard&quot;, and &quot;The New Criterion&quot;. He subsequently stepped back from writing and now devotes most of his time to his show.

Steyn&#x27;s books include &quot;Broadway Babies Say Goodnight: Musicals Then and Now&quot;, a history of the musical theatre, and the political &quot;America Alone: The End of the World as We Know It&quot;, a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller which predicts the downfall of the West. He has also published collections of his columns and celebrity obituaries, as well as profiles from &quot;The Atlantic&quot;.

Steyn held a Eugene C. Pulliam Visiting Fellowship in Journalism at Hillsdale College in spring 2013. As of 2010, Steyn was no longer the back-page columnist for the print edition of &quot;National Review&quot;, conservative writer James Lileks having taken over that space. Steyn&#x27;s back-page column for &quot;National Review&quot;, &quot;Happy Warriors&quot;, resumed with the issue of March 21, 2011.

Steyn has contributed to the blog Ricochet.com and recorded numerous podcasts with the organization.

Steyn frequently guest-hosted &quot;The Rush Limbaugh Show&quot;.

From December 2016 to February 2017, Steyn hosted &quot;The Mark Steyn Show&quot; on the CRTV Digital Network. CRTV abruptly cancelled the show after two months and went to arbitration, with both sides claiming breach of contract. Steyn also sued to keep the show on the air during arbitration, saying it was on behalf of his employees. Former show supervisor Mike Young called this &quot;bullshit&quot; when quoted in &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;. Former employees provided sworn declarations that Steyn was &quot;incredibly disorganised&quot;, tyrannical, and impossible to work with. Steyn was awarded damages for breach of contract, which was confirmed on appeal, as well as attorneys&#x27; fees.

In October 2021, Steyn began covering for Nigel Farage on his prime time show &quot;Farage&quot; on GB News on Fridays and was a relief presenter for Farage on other days. On November 19, 2021, Steyn received a permanent prime time host billing on GB News, with the Friday show renamed &quot;Mark Steyn&quot;. In January 2022, the show began airing five nights a week, Monday to Friday, which in February was reduced to Monday to Thursday. In March 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Steyn presented the show from Western Ukraine.

In December 2022, Steyn suffered a heart attack while broadcasting the Mark Steyn Show on GB News TV. He did not recognise the symptoms as a heart attack, but later suffered a second, while in France, where he was hospitalised.

Steyn quit GB News in February 2023, in protest at the channel wanting to change his contract to make him personally liable for any fines issued by the UK&#x27;s media regulator Ofcom, which was then investigating 411 complaints from viewers about Covid vaccine scepticism aired on Steyn&#x27;s show, in potential breach of the Broadcasting Code. Steyn also complained changes in his contract would force him and his staff to attend regulatory compliance training sessions, which he referred to as &quot;re-education classes&quot;.

On 6 March 2023, Steyn was found by Ofcom to have breached its rules during a GB News programme about COVID-19 vaccines. Ofcom said the Steyn programme had &quot;presented a materially misleading interpretation of official data without sufficient challenge or counterweight&quot;.

==Positions==
===Criticism of the news media===
In a May 2004 column, Steyn commented that editors were encouraging anti-Bush sentiments after the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; had published faked pictures, which originated on American and Hungarian pornographic Web sites, of British and American soldiers supposedly sexually abusing Iraqis. Steyn argued that the media only wanted to show images to Westerners &quot;that will shame and demoralize them.&quot;

In a July 2005 column for &quot;National Review&quot;, Steyn criticized Andrew Jaspan, then the editor of &quot;The Age&quot;, an Australian newspaper. Jaspan was offended by Douglas Wood, an Australian kidnapped and held hostage in Iraq, who after his rescue referred to his captors as &quot;arseholes.&quot; Jaspan claimed that &quot;the issue is really largely, speaking as I understand it, he was treated well there. He says he was fed every day, and as such to turn around and use that kind of language I think is just insensitive.&quot; Steyn argued that there is nothing at all wrong with insensitivity toward murderous captors, and that it was Jaspan, not Wood, who suffered from Stockholm syndrome. He said further, &quot;A blindfolded Mr. Wood had to listen to his captors murder two of his colleagues a few inches away, but how crude and boorish would one have to be to hold that against one&#x27;s hosts?&quot;

===Conrad Black trial===

Steyn wrote articles and maintained a blog for &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; covering the 2007 business fraud trial of his friend and financial patron Conrad Black in Chicago, from the point of view of one who was adamantly convinced Black never committed any crime. Doing this, he later wrote, &quot;cost me my gig at the [Chicago] &quot;Sun-Times&quot;&quot; and &quot;took me away from more lucrative duties such as book promotion&quot;. Steyn expressed dismay at &quot;the procedural advantages the prosecution enjoys—the inducements it&#x27;s able to dangle in order to turn witnesses that, if offered by the defence, would be regarded as the suborning of perjury; or the confiscation of assets intended to prevent an accused person from being able to mount a defence; or the piling on of multiple charges which virtually guarantees that a jury will seek to demonstrate its balanced judgment by convicting on something. All that speaks very poorly for the federal justice system.&quot;

After Black&#x27;s conviction, Steyn published a long essay in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; about the case, strongly criticizing Black&#x27;s defense team.

===Muslim immigration views===
Steyn opposes unfettered Muslim immigration to the United States, which he describes as dangerous. According to Steyn, the West faces a choice &quot;between liberty and mass Muslim immigration.&quot;

Steyn believes that if mass Muslim migration to Europe is not stopped, Europe will turn into what he calls &quot;Eurabia&quot;, a future society where the European continent will be dominated by Islam. He has written: &quot;much of what we loosely call the Western world will not survive this century, and much of it will effectively disappear in our lifetimes, including many, if not most Western European countries.&quot;

In his book &quot;America Alone&quot;, Steyn likened Europe to Bosnia in the lead-up to its civil war and genocide: 

When some critics claimed that Steyn was advocating genocide in this passage, he wrote: 

Steyn has written about Muslim demographic projections to back up Bat Ye&#x27;or&#x27;s Eurabia theory and has been on the board of advisors of the International Free Press Society, both key components of the international counter-jihad movement. In 2012, he also participated in the international counter-jihad conference in Brussels, billed as the &quot;International Conference for Free Speech &amp; Human Rights&quot;.

===Support of the invasion of Iraq===
Steyn was an early proponent of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In 2007, he reiterated his support while attacking Democrat John Murtha, stating that Murtha&#x27;s plan for military action in Iraq was designed &quot;to deny the president the possibility of victory while making sure Democrats don&#x27;t have to share the blame for the defeat. ... [Murtha] doesn&#x27;t support them in the mission, but he&#x27;d like them to continue failing at it for a couple more years&quot;.

In 2013, Steyn blamed the United States&#x27; lack of success in Iraq on &quot;geopolitical ADHD&quot;, writing &quot;the unceasing drumbeat of &#x27;quagmire&#x27; and &#x27;exit strategy&#x27; communicated to the world an emptiness at the heart of American power...An awareness that America lacks &quot;credibility&quot; and &quot;will&quot; is what caused crowds to attack U.S. embassies and the consulate in Benghazi.&quot; Steyn&#x27;s column prompted &quot;The Atlantic&quot; to call him an &quot;unapologetic hawk&quot;, observing how his column failed to take account of his own declarations of victory in Iraq in 2004 when Steyn wrote: &quot;After 15 months of running Iraq, the Americans are out...the Americans have bequeathed them a better Iraq than the one the British invented for them eight decades ago...So I&#x27;m relaxed about Iraq: its future lies somewhere between good enough and great.&quot;

==Books==
===&quot;The Story of Miss Saigon&quot;===
In one of his first books, &quot;The Story of Miss Saigon&quot; (1991) co-written with Edward Behr, Steyn offered up his stance on the &quot;Miss Saigon&quot; controversy of 1990. Steyn accused the Asian-American activists opposed to the musical &quot;Miss Saigon&quot; of a &quot;new tribalism&quot; that threatened to bring in &quot;a new era of conformity and sanctimoniousness&quot;.

===&quot;America Alone&quot;===

Steyn&#x27;s work &quot;America Alone: The End of the World as We Know It&quot; is a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselling nonfiction book published in 2006. It deals with the global war on terror and wider issues of demographics in Muslim and non-Muslim populations. It was recommended by George W. Bush. The paperback edition, released in April 2008 with a new introduction, was labeled &quot;Soon to Be Banned in Canada&quot;, alluding to a possible result that Steyn then anticipated from the Canadian Islamic Congress&#x27; human rights complaints against Maclean&#x27;s magazine.

====Response to &quot;America Alone&quot;====
In an essay about &quot;America Alone&quot;, Christopher Hitchens wrote that &quot;Mark Steyn believes that demography is destiny, and he makes an immensely convincing case,&quot; then detailed many points at which he disagreed with Steyn. Hitchens believed Steyn erred by &quot;considering European Muslim populations as one. Islam is as fissile as any other religion, and considerable friction exists among immigrant Muslim groups in many European countries. Moreover, many Muslims actually have come to Europe for the advertised purposes; seeking asylum and to build a better life.&quot; Nevertheless, Hitchens expressed strong agreement with some of Steyn&#x27;s points, calling the book &quot;admirably tough-minded.&quot;

===&quot;After America&quot;===

In 2011, Steyn published &quot;After America: Get Ready for Armageddon&quot;, a follow-up to &quot;America Alone&quot;. In it, he argues that the U.S. is now on the same trajectory towards decline and fall as the rest of the West due to unsustainable national spending and the subsequent borrowing involved to pay for expanding government. Within its pages, &quot;After America&quot; discusses the U.S. federal debt specifically and more generally the rise of bureaucratic state control as individual initiative declines.

Should decline continue to affect peoples&#x27; lives and the expansion of debt go on, Steyn&#x27;s ultimate worries are apocalyptic, with him declaring,
&quot;After America&quot; peaked at number four on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list for non-fiction, but tagged with a dagger for bulk orders. Although written in a polemical style about controversial issues, praise came from publications such as &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, where Steyn received comparison to George Orwell, and &quot;The Spectator&quot;, where Steyn&#x27;s sense of prose received comparison to pyrotechnics.

On August 17, 2011, Steyn discussed the book and a variety of related issues while delivering the first lecture in &quot;The NHIOP Bookmark Series&quot;, a program of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire. C-SPAN recorded Steyn&#x27;s comments.

== Legal issues ==
===Canadian Islamic Congress human rights complaint===

In 2007, a complaint was filed with the Ontario Human Rights Commission related to Steyn&#x27;s article, entitled &quot;The Future Belongs to Islam&quot;, published in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine. The complainants alleged that the article and the refusal of &quot;Maclean&quot;&#x27;s to provide space for a rebuttal violated their human rights. The complainants also claimed that the article was one of twenty-two (22) &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; articles, many written by Steyn, about Muslims. Further complaints were filed with the Canadian Human Rights Commission, later stripped of its mandate by the Canadian parliament in 2011, and the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal.

The Ontario Human Rights Commission refused in April 2008 to proceed, saying it lacked jurisdiction to deal with magazine content. However, the Commission stated that it &quot;strongly condemns the Islamophobic portrayal of Muslims ... Media has a responsibility to engage in fair and unbiased journalism.&quot; Critics of the Commission claimed that &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; and Steyn had been found guilty without a hearing. John Martin of &quot;The Province&quot; wrote, &quot;There was no hearing, no evidence presented and no opportunity to offer a defence—just a pronouncement of wrongdoing.&quot;

The OHRC defended its right to comment by stating, &quot;Like racial profiling and other types of discrimination, ascribing the behaviour of individuals to a group damages everyone in that group. We have always spoken out on such issues. &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; and its writers are free to express their opinions. The OHRC is mandated to express what it sees as unfair and harmful comment or conduct that may lead to discrimination.&quot;

Steyn subsequently criticized the Commission, commenting that &quot;Even though they (the OHRC) don&#x27;t have the guts to hear the case, they might as well find us guilty. Ingenious!&quot;

Soon afterwards, the head of the Canadian Human Rights Commission issued a public letter to the editor of &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine. In it, Jennifer Lynch said, &quot;Mr. Steyn would have us believe that words, however hateful, should be given . History has shown us that hateful words sometimes lead to hurtful actions that undermine freedom and have led to unspeakable crimes. That is why Canada and most other democracies have enacted legislation to place reasonable limits on the expression of hatred.&quot; The &quot;National Post&quot; subsequently defended Steyn and sharply criticized Lynch, stating that Lynch has &quot;no clear understanding of free speech or the value of protecting it&quot; and that &quot;No human right is more basic than freedom of expression, not even the &quot;right&quot; to live one&#x27;s life free from offence by remarks about one&#x27;s ethnicity, gender, culture or orientation.&quot;

The federal Canadian Human Rights Commission dismissed the Canadian Islamic Congress&#x27; complaint against &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; in June 2008. The CHRC&#x27;s ruling said of the article that, &quot;the writing is polemical, colourful and emphatic, and was obviously calculated to excite discussion and even offend certain readers, Muslim and non-Muslim alike.&quot; However, the Commission ruled that overall, &quot;the views expressed in the Steyn article, when considered as a whole and in context, are not of an extreme nature, as defined by the Supreme Court.&quot;

Steyn later wrote a lengthy reflection of his turmoil with the commissions and the tribunals. The reflection appears as the introduction to &quot;The Tyranny of Nice&quot;, a book authored by Kathy Shaidle and Pete Vere on Canada&#x27;s human rights commissions.

=== Defamation lawsuit ===
In February 2024, a civil trial jury in Washington found that Mark Steyn and Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) blogger Rand Simberg defamed and injured climatologist Michael E. Mann in blog posts. The jury awarded Mann $1 in compensatory damages from each writer. It awarded punitive damages of $1,000 from Simberg and $1 million from Steyn, after finding that the pair made their statements with &quot;maliciousness, spite, ill will, vengeance or deliberate intent to harm.&quot; 

The defamatory statements were from 2012, when Simberg accused American climatologist Mann of &quot;deception&quot; and &quot;engaging in data manipulation&quot; and alleged that the Penn State investigation that had cleared Mann was a &quot;cover-up and whitewash&quot; comparable to the recent Jerry Sandusky sex scandal, &quot;except that instead of molesting children, he has molested and tortured data.&quot; The CEI blog editor then removed the sentence as &quot;inappropriate&quot;, but a &quot;National Review&quot; blog post by Steyn cited it and alleged that Mann&#x27;s hockey stick graph was &quot;fraudulent&quot;.

Mann asked CEI and &quot;National Review&quot; to remove the allegations and apologize, or he would take action. The CEI published further insults, and &quot;National Review&quot; Editor Rich Lowry responded in an article headed &quot;Get Lost&quot; with a declaration that, should Mann sue, the discovery process would be used to reveal and publish Mann&#x27;s emails. Mann&#x27;s lawyer filed the defamation lawsuit in October 2012.

Before the case could go to discovery, CEI and &quot;National Review&quot; filed a court motion to dismiss it under anti-SLAPP legislation, with the claim that they had merely been using exaggerated language which was acceptable against a public figure. In July 2013, the judge ruled against this motion, and when the defendants took this to appeal a new judge also denied their motion to dismiss, in January 2014.&quot; National Review&quot; changed its lawyers, and Steyn decided to represent himself in court. Journalist Seth Shulman, at the Union of Concerned Scientists, welcomed the judge&#x27;s statement that accusations of fraud &quot;go to the heart of scientific integrity. They can be proven true or false. If false, they are defamatory. If made with actual malice, they are actionable.&quot;

The defendants again appealed against the decision, and on August 11, 2014, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press with 26 other organizations, including the ACLU, Bloomberg, Gannett (&quot;USA Today&quot;), Comcast (NBCUniversal), Time, Fox News and The Seattle Times Company, filed an amicus brief arguing that the comments at issue were constitutionally protected as opinion. Steyn chose to be represented by attorney Daniel J. Kornstein.

An appeal to have the lawsuit thrown out, filed by Steyn&#x27;s co-defendants (&quot;National Review&quot;, CEI and Simberg), was heard in the D.C. Court of Appeals on November 25, 2014. Steyn was present for oral arguments but did not join the appeal, preferring to go to trial. On December 22, 2016, the D.C. appeals court ruled that Mann&#x27;s case against Simberg and Steyn could go ahead. A &quot;reasonable jury&quot; could find against the defendants, and though the context should be considered, &quot;if the statements assert or imply false facts that defame the individual, they do not find shelter under the First Amendment simply because they are embedded in a larger policy debate.&quot;. A counterclaim Steyn filed through his attorneys on March 17, 2014, was dismissed with prejudice by the D.C. court on August 29, 2019, leaving Steyn to pay litigation costs.

The defendants filed for &quot;certiorari&quot; with the U.S. Supreme Court in the hope it would hear their appeal. On November 25, 2019, it denied the petition without comment. In a dissenting opinion, associate justice Samuel Alito wrote that he had favored hearing the case on the basis that, even though the defendants might yet prevail in the case or the outcome itself come before the Court for review, the expense of litigating the case this far may itself have a chilling effect which would deter speakers. Mann said that he looked forward to the trial.

On February 8, 2024, after a jury trial in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, each of the co-defendants was ordered to pay Mann $1 in compensatory damages. Mann was awarded $1,000 in punitive damages from Simberg and $1 million from Steyn. Steyn, who had self-represented, said through his manager he would be appealing the punitive damages, as did Simberg, through his lawyer. 

Regarding the one dollar compensatory damage award, Steyn indicated it vindicated his belief that Mann never suffered any actual injury. The two writers had argued during the trial that Mann become famous in the years after their remarks.

==Critical reception==
Steyn&#x27;s writing has drawn supporters and detractors for both content and style. Martin Amis, who was harshly criticized in &quot;America Alone&quot; but gave it a positive review, said of the style: &quot;Mark Steyn is an oddity: his thoughts and themes are sane and serious—but he writes like a maniac.&quot; His style was described by Robert Fulford as &quot;bring[ing] to public affairs the dark comedy developed in the Theatre of the Absurd.&quot; Longtime editor and admirer Fulford also wrote, &quot;Steyn, a self-styled &#x27;right-wing bastard,&#x27; violates everyone&#x27;s sense of good taste.&quot; According to Simon Mann, Steyn &quot;gives succour to the maxim the pen is mightier than the sword, though he is not averse to employing the former to advocate use of the latter.&quot; Dan Kennedy, professor of journalism at North Eastern University, has described Steyn&#x27;s journalistic technique as &quot;write, twist, smear and sneer, repeat!&quot; Charlie Pierce told the &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot; in 2004 that &quot;If a guy who is that nakedly, intellectually dishonest can become a successful conservative writer, then conservative intellectualism is dead in this country. If it began with Buckley and the people who taught him, it ends with the likes of Mark Steyn.&quot;

Susan Catto in &quot;Time&quot; believed Steyn had an interest in controversy: &quot;Instead of shying away from the appearance of conflict, Steyn positively revels in it.&quot; Canadian journalist Steve Burgess wrote: &quot;Steyn wields his rhetorical rapier with genuine skill&quot; and that national disasters tended to cause Steyn &quot;to display his inner wingnut.&quot;

In 2009, Canadian journalist Paul Wells accused Steyn of dramatically exaggerating the rise of fascist political parties in Europe. Wells also accused Steyn of repeatedly &quot;shrieking&quot; about Islam in his political writings.

===Awards===
In 2005, Steyn received the Henry Salvatori Prize in the American Founding at the Claremont Institute established by philanthropist and conservative leader Henry Salvatori. It is awarded in honour of those who &quot;distinguish themselves by an understanding of, and actions taken to preserve and foster the principles upon which the United States was built&quot;.

Steyn was awarded the 2006 Eric Breindel Award for Excellence in Opinion Journalism for writing which &quot;best reflects love of this country and its democratic institutions&quot;. Roger Ailes of Fox News presented the prize, which included a check for $20,000.

Steyn received the Center for Security Policy&#x27;s Mightier Pen award in 2007, receiving it at an event featuring a convocation by Jewish scholar and rabbi Yitz Greenberg and remarks by Board of Regents Honorary Chairman Bruce Gelb. In 2010, Steyn was presented the Sappho Award from the International Free Press Society in Copenhagen, Denmark for what was described as both &quot;his ample contributions as a cultural critic&quot; and &quot;his success in influencing the debate on Islam, the disastrous ideology of multiculturalism and the crisis of the Western civilization.&quot;

Steyn received the inaugural George Jonas Freedom Award at a gala hosted by the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms in Toronto in 2018.

==Personal life==
Steyn lives and works mainly in Woodsville, New Hampshire, U.S. He has three children.

<text>Dunstable Downs are part of the Chiltern Hills, in southern Bedfordshire, England; and are located near (and named after) the town of Dunstable. They are a chalk escarpment forming the north-eastern reaches of the Chilterns. At , Dunstable Downs are the highest point in the county of Bedfordshire.

Because of its elevation, Dunstable Downs hosted a station in the shutter telegraph chain which connected the Admiralty in London to its naval ships in the port of Great Yarmouth during the years 1808 to 1814.

Whipsnade Zoo has cut an enormous lion shape into the chalk on the side of one of the hills. The lion can be seen from the B489 (Aylesbury to Dunstable road).

The downs are used by gliders, kite fliers, hang gliders and paragliders in the area because of their height. The London Gliding Club is based at the foot of the downs.

Much of the downs is managed by the National Trust as part of the Dunstable Downs &amp; Whipsnade Estate property.

==Ascents==
Central Bedfordshire Council and the National Trust commissioned Archetype architects to build a visitor centre known as the Chilterns Gateway Centre, on the very top of Dunstable Downs. The summit is right next to the B4541 road that crosses the hill, and so an ascent of the hill requires nothing more than getting out of a car at the highest point and walking across to the trig point.

For those who wish to climb the hill from the base, it is possible to do a circular walk from the village of Whipsnade by following the Icknield Way Path and Chiltern Way, both of which are marked on Ordnance Survey maps. This circuit can be extended to take in the northern top of Five Knolls. The hill can also be ascended from Dunstable to the north.
The Icknield Way Trail, a horse rider and off-road cycle route, has been established following a similar route to the Icknield Way Path which passes over the Dunstable Downs.

== Archaeological sites ==

The Five Knolls Barrow Cemetery is located at the northern tip of the Dunstable Downs. First described by antiquarian William Stukeley in the 18th century, the site contained burials from the late Neolithic to Saxon eras prior to excavation. They include the &quot;Five Knolls Woman&quot;, aged between 35 and 40 years, buried on her side with a flint knife. A , buried with a number of echinoid fossils were also found, dating approximately from the early Bronze Age. The site is also known for the deviant burial of executed Saxon criminals.

==Natural history==

The downs are home to a wide variety of wildlife including many rare wild flowers, such as the bee orchid, and butterfly species, like the marbled white and the chalkhill blue.

Areas of the west-facing slope were notified in 1987 under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) called Dunstable and Whipsnade Downs. Blow&#x27;s Down is a continuation of the Dunstable Downs escarpment on the eastern side of Dunstable. It is also an SSSI and most of it is managed by the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire (as Blow&#x27;s Downs).

<doc id="663107" wikidata="Q3814839" url="?curid=663107" title="Kevin O'Neill (basketball)">
<text>Kevin James O&#x27;Neill (born January 24, 1957) is an American basketball coach with experience as the head coach of various college and National Basketball Association (NBA) teams. Most recently he was the coach of the USC Trojans basketball team.

O&#x27;Neill was born in Malone, New York and attended McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He lettered in basketball for three years in college, 1976–79, and in 1978 the McGill Redman had a school-record 28 win season and entered the Canadian Interuniversity Sport men&#x27;s basketball championship tournament. He graduated from McGill in 1979 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in education, and later earned his master&#x27;s degree in secondary education from Marycrest College in 1983, where he also served as head coach of the NAIA basketball team for the 1982–83 season.

==Early life==
Born in Malone, New York, O&#x27;Neill grew up in nearby Chateaugay and graduated from Chateaugay Central School in 1975.

==Early coaching career==

O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s head coaching career began with tenures at North Country Community College (Saranac Lake, New York), Marycrest College (Davenport, Iowa), Marquette, Tennessee and Northwestern. During his tenure as the Northwestern coach O&#x27;Neill is most notably remembered for a game with Indiana where the rowdy Northwestern faithful chanted &quot;Hoosier Daddy&quot; (a play on &quot;Who&#x27;s Your Daddy?&quot;) at opposing coach Bob Knight. Of course this did not sit well with Knight as he and O&#x27;Neill got into it during the contest. However all was settled under a practice gym basket well after the game as ESPN camera crews caught the coaches talking their issues out. He would eventually become an assistant coach under Jeff Van Gundy with the New York Knicks. In 2001, he joined the Detroit Pistons under head coach Rick Carlisle.

==Marquette Golden Eagles==
As the head coach at Marquette, O&#x27;Neill led the then-Warriors to two 20+ win seasons, two NCAA tournament appearances, and a Great Midwest Conference Championship. O&#x27;Neill played a prominent role in the 1994 Oscar-nominated documentary, Hoop Dreams.

==Toronto Raptors 2003–04==
The McGill University graduate returned to Canada in June 2003 as the head coach of the Toronto Raptors. His tenure was marked by inconsistency among his players, but the team was 25–25 after 50 games and in a position to return to the playoffs. However, injuries to key players resulted in the team going 8–24 to finish the season three games out of a playoff spot. On April 17, 2004, O&#x27;Neill was fired in the aftermath of a disappointing 2003–2004 season, after making some remarks which were taken to question the team&#x27;s commitment to winning.

==Indiana Pacers==
In the 2004–2005 season he was hired as an assistant coach with the Indiana Pacers where he rejoined head coach Rick Carlisle.

==Arizona Wildcats 2007–08==
On May 1, 2007, it was announced that O&#x27;Neill would replace Jim Rosborough as the assistant coach to Hall of Famer Lute Olson at the University of Arizona. O&#x27;Neill was an assistant under Olson during Arizona&#x27;s rise to national prominence in the 1980s, and used it as a launching board to attain his first major head coaching position at Marquette.

On November 4, 2007, Olson announced that he was taking an &quot;indefinite leave of absence&quot;, and that O&#x27;Neill would assume Olson&#x27;s head coaching duties in his absence. On December 6 Olson released a statement stating that he would be extending his leave of absence for the remainder of the season. He cited personal family reasons that required his immediate attention; the next day, his attorney revealed that Olson had filed for divorce from his second wife. The same day it was announced that O&#x27;Neill would remain the interim head coach for the rest of the season.

Later the same month, on December 18, Arizona athletic director Jim Livengood announced O&#x27;Neill as the designated successor to Olson. Olson said at the time he planned to return for the 2008–09 season; Livengood stated that O&#x27;Neill would succeed Olson upon his retirement. In March 2008, Olson confirmed that he would return as head coach for the 2008–2009 season, and said that he planned to coach until his contract ended in 2011. With the announcement of Olson&#x27;s return, the O&#x27;Neill succession plan was thrown into question amidst media rumors of disagreement between Olson and O&#x27;Neill.

Only a month later, Lute Olson announced that O&#x27;Neill would not be retained on the University of Arizona staff. After spending the spring and summer preparing for the upcoming season, Olson abruptly and unexpectedly announced his permanent retirement from the Arizona basketball program in October 2008; his personal physician cited health concerns as the reason.

==Memphis Grizzlies 2008–09==
In May 2008, O&#x27;Neill was hired as an assistant coach &amp; special assistant to the GM for the Memphis Grizzlies.

==USC Trojans 2009–2013==
On June 20, 2009, O&#x27;Neill was named head coach of the USC men&#x27;s basketball team.

O&#x27;Neill along with noted USC booster Nik Visger were involved in an altercation with an Arizona Wildcats booster at his hotel on March 10, 2011. As a result, O&#x27;Neill was suspended for the rest of the Pac-10 tournament, which resulted in a 67–62 loss for the Trojans.

O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s 2012–2013 entered the season with high hopes based around a number of transfers coming in from other programs. The team started the season 3–6, fueling speculation that it would be O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s last at USC. Much of this speculation was due to the fact that O&#x27;Neill sold his Los Angeles home, and relocated to Coronado, CA, which is located over 125 miles away from USC.

On January 14, 2013 Pat Haden, USC Athletic Director, announced that O&#x27;Neill had been relieved of his duties at the university after beginning the season 7–10 (2–2 Pac-12).

==Broadcasting career==
In October 2013, O&#x27;Neill joined Fox Sports as a college basketball analyst.

<text>Top Cow Productions is an American comics publisher, an imprint of Image Comics. It was founded by Marc Silvestri in 1992.

==History==

During the early years of Image Comics, founder Marc Silvestri shared a studio with Jim Lee. In this studio, he created his first creator-owned comic book, &quot;Cyberforce&quot;, as part of Image&#x27;s initial line-up. After setting up his own studio, Top Cow Productions, he expanded into other comics, launching &quot;&quot;, a new &quot;Cyberforce&quot; series and various spin-offs.

Top Cow attracted several professionals including artist Brandon Peterson, writer Garth Ennis and former Marvel staffer David Wohl. The company also helped launch the careers of various writers and artists, such as Christina Z, Joe Benitez, Michael Turner and David Finch. Benitez, Turner and Finch have since worked for DC and Marvel Comics.

In 1996, Top Cow briefly parted ways with Image during a power struggle with Image associate Rob Liefeld. Liefeld left the company shortly after Top Cow&#x27;s departure, and Top Cow returned to the partnership. At the same time, Top Cow was moving more into the fantasy genre with new properties &quot;Witchblade&quot; and &quot;The Darkness&quot;. Thanks to the success of &quot;Witchblade&quot;, Top Cow was able to expand, adding new titles to its lineup including &quot;The Darkness&quot;, &quot;Magdalena&quot;, &quot;Aphrodite IX&quot;, and others. Silvestri was heavily involved in training and developing new talent through the studio and Top Cow was known for a time for its &quot;house style&quot; (standardized elements of illustration across multiple titles produced by Top Cow), though former publisher Filip Sablik has argued that the company never truly had a house style.

In addition to its company-owned properties, Top Cow has worked with creators to develop creator-owned properties. These properties have included Michael Turner&#x27;s &quot;Fathom&quot; (which eventually ended up at Aspen Comics), and Joe&#x27;s Comics, created exclusively for J. Michael Straczynski, which included &quot;Rising Stars&quot; and &quot;Midnight Nation&quot;. Top Cow is also known for bringing &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;&#x27;s Lara Croft to comics.

In 2006, Top Cow made a business agreement with Marvel Comics to publish crossovers such as &quot;Darkness/Wolverine&quot; and &quot;Witchblade/Punisher&quot;. As part of this agreement, several Top Cow artists also provided art chores on various Marvel series. Tyler Kirkham worked on &quot;Phoenix: Warsong&quot; and &quot;New Avengers/Transformers&quot;; Mike Choi worked on &quot;X-23: Target X&quot;; and Silvestri himself worked on &quot;X-Men: Messiah Complex&quot;. At the 2007 San Diego Comic-Con, an announcement was made by Marvel Comics extending the deal into 2008.

At the 2007 New York Comic Con Top Cow announced that they would be one of the first major comics publishers to offer online distribution, through a partnership with IGN. The initial titles offered included &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;, &quot;The Darkness&quot;, and &quot;Witchblade&quot;, at $1.99 per issue. They also announced a deal with Zannel to license their comics as mobile comics.

In 2022, Top Cow Productions reprinted the early issues of &quot;Cyberforce&quot; for the first time since 1994 in a 30th anniversary commemorative hardcover edition The project was funded through Kickstarter, and the commemorative edition was exclusively available through the platform. The book collected &quot;Cyberforce&quot; #0, &quot;Tin Men of War&quot; #1-4, &quot;WildCATS&quot; #5-7, &quot;Cyberforce&quot; volume 2 #1-13, &quot;Origins&quot; #1 (&quot;Cyblade&quot;) and #2 (&quot;Stryker&quot;), and &quot;Cyberforce Annual&quot; #1. Later in the same year the book was reprinted in a trade paperback with the same contents.

In 2024, the company announced a new &quot;Witchblade&quot; series written by Marguerite Bennett and drawn by Giuseppe Cafaro.

==Titles==
==Media adaptations==
===&quot;The Darkness&quot;===

====Film====
In December 2004, Dimension Films paid an undisclosed six-figure sum to develop a movie based on the comic, possibly for release in 2008. The film was pitched as a movie similar to &quot;The Crow&quot;, which was also produced by Dimension. There have been no further developments.

====Video games====
In March 2005, &quot;The Darkness&quot; was licensed by Majesco Entertainment for a console game to be developed by Starbreeze Studios. 2K Games later obtained the rights to the game, and a first-person shooter adaptation was released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 console systems on June 25, 2007, in the United States. In the EU, the game was released for Xbox 360 on June 29, 2007, and for PS3 on July 20 of the same year.

To promote the video game, a five-issue mini-series was released, with each issue chronicled a chapter of the game. In June 2007, the mini-series was collected into a trade paperback.

In February 2012, a sequel to the video game, entitled &quot;The Darkness II&quot;, was released for PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The script for the game was written by comic book writer Paul Jenkins, who previously worked on &quot;The Darkness&quot; comic series. Unlike the first game, the graphics for &quot;The Darkness II&quot; were developed using a cel-shading technique, emulating the aesthetic of its graphic novel namesake. The game received positive reviews from critics.

===&quot;Witchblade&quot;===

====Television series====
Following a pilot film in August 2000, the cable network TNT premiered a television series based on the comic book series in 2001. The series was directed by Ralph Hemecker and written by Marc Silvestri and J.D. Zeik. Yancy Butler starred as Sara Pezzini. Although critically acclaimed and popular with audiences, it was canceled in September 2002. The cancellation was announced as a production decision, but there was widespread speculation that the true reason for its cancellation was Butler&#x27;s alcohol addiction; Butler was ordered to enter rehab for alcohol addiction a year later, after being arrested for wandering intoxicated amidst traffic.

&quot;Witchblade&quot; ran for two 12–episode seasons on TNT. The first episode aired on June 12, 2001, and the last episode aired on August 26, 2002. On April 1, 2008, Warner Home Video announced a long-anticipated DVD release. &quot;Witchblade: The Complete Series&quot; — a seven-disc collectors set including the original made-for-TV movie, all 23 episodes of the series, and special features — was released July 29, 2008.

====Reboot====
In January 2017, NBC announced that it would be developing a &quot;Witchblade&quot; reboot, with Carol Mendelsohn and Caroline Dries serving as executive producers.

====Film adaptation====
An American superhero film based on the series was announced in 2008. The film was to be directed by Michael Rymer, who directed the 2002 film &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot; and several episodes of &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, and was to be written by Everett De Roche.

The film was one of the two being produced and financed back-to-back by Platinum Studios, IDG Films and Relativity Media. The film was to be produced by Arclight&#x27;s Gary Hamilton and Nigel Odell, Platinum Studios&#x27; Scott Mitchell Rosenberg, and Steve Squillante of Havenwood Media. Top Cow&#x27;s Marc Silvestri and Matt Hawkins were to be executive producers with Platinum Studios&#x27; Rich Marincic and Greenberg Group&#x27;s Randy Greenberg. Filming was announced to begin in September 2008, with China and Australia among the possible locations being considered for filming. Megan Fox was approached for the role of Sara Pezzini at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con.

The film&#x27;s website and teaser poster were released in May 2008, but the project was later cancelled.

====Anime series====

In 2004 Japanese animation studio GONZO announced an anime version of &quot;Witchblade&quot;, with a subsequent manga adaptation. The anime version is considered controversial by some, because GONZO has announced that the main character of the anime is of Japanese ethnicity but is not Itagaki, one of the previous bearers of the Witchblade. Instead the main character is a new character named Masane. Although this series centers around all new characters and tells a new story not contained in the source material, it is set in the same continuity as the comic book. The anime series began broadcast during April 2006 and ran for 24 episodes.

<doc id="663120" wikidata="Q7087425" url="?curid=663120" title="Oliver Brown (American activist)">
<text>Oliver Leon Brown (August 2, 1918 – June 20, 1961) was an African-American welder who was the plaintiff in the landmark 1954 U.S. Supreme Court case &quot;Oliver Brown, et al. v. Board of Education of Topeka, et al&quot;. 

== Biography and Supreme Court case ==
Brown was recruited to be part of the Topeka NAACP legal action to desegregate the city&#x27;s public elementary schools in 1950. At the time, he was a welder for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and was studying to become a minister. Attorney Charles Scott, his childhood friend, asked him to join the roster of parents who would become plaintiffs in the organization&#x27;s case against the Topeka Board of Education.

By the fall of 1950, the Topeka NAACP had assembled a group of 13 parents to serve as plaintiffs for the case that would eventually be filed under the name of one of the parents, Oliver Brown, becoming known as &quot;Oliver L. Brown et al. v. the Board of Education of Topeka (KS)&quot;. In the Topeka NAACP case, parents involved were concerned that their children had to be bused many blocks away from their neighborhoods when there were schools nearby. However, those schools were segregated, and for white children only. African-American children were assigned to one of the only four segregated schools for them.

After an unsuccessful attempt in federal district court, the NAACP case was appealed to the United States Supreme Court, where it was joined with cases from Delaware, South Carolina, Virginia and Washington, D.C.

After the initial arguments in early 1953, the high court suffered the loss of Chief Justice Fred Vinson, who died suddenly. President Dwight Eisenhower then appointed former California Governor Earl Warren, who set a schedule for the cases to be reargued in late 1953. After several months of oral arguments, led by attorney Thurgood Marshall who was Director/Counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund (and would later be a Supreme Court justice himself), on May 17, 1954, Chief Justice Warren announced the court&#x27;s landmark unanimous decision in favor of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs included several hundred parents in addition to the 13 families in the Topeka case. 

This decision overturned the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine that had been used as the standard in civil rights lawsuits since the &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; case in 1896, in effect declaring it unconstitutional to have separate public schools for Black and white students. The decision is considered a major milestone in the Civil Rights Movement.

== Death and legacy ==
Brown was only 42 in 1961, when he became ill and died suddenly of a heart attack on the Kansas Turnpike just outside of Lawrence. He had been riding with fellow pastor Maurice Lange en route to Topeka where his wife and daughters were visiting her parents.

In 1988, the nonprofit Brown Foundation for Educational Equity, Excellence and Research was founded by Oliver Brown&#x27;s family, along with Topeka community members, to preserve the legacy of the Brown decision. His daughter Cheryl Brown Henderson is the founding president of the foundation.

On October 26, 1992, after two years of work by the Brown Foundation, President George H. W. Bush signed the &quot;Brown v. The Board of Education National Historic Site Act&quot;, establishing the former Monroe Elementary School, one of the four formerly segregated African American elementary schools, as a national historic site.

Oliver and Leola’s eldest daughter Linda Brown Thompson died on March 25, 2018, at the age of 75. When she died, the media reported erroneously that she had been the center of the Brown case, when in fact the focus of the arguments was on behalf of numerous plaintiffs from the five cases consolidated by the United States Supreme Court.

<text>Jeffrey Glen Jones is an American comics artist who is known for his work on titles such as &quot;Wanted&quot; and &quot;Final Crisis&quot;.

==Early life==
Jones hails from Walker, Louisiana and attended Louisiana State University and the University at Albany, SUNY where he received his Master of Fine Arts degree.

==Career==
J. G. Jones made his debut in the comics industry in 1994 by drawing &quot;Dark Dominion&quot; for Defiant Comics. He is best known for his work as cover artist on various comic book series, including a stint on Brian K. Vaughan&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and for DC Comics, the six-issue limited series &quot;Villains United&quot; written by Gail Simone, as well as all 52 covers for the maxi-series &quot;52&quot;.

In 1999, Jones and writer Devin K. Grayson introduced the Yelena Belova character in the &quot;Black Widow&quot; limited series. The following year, Jones worked with writer Grant Morrison on the &quot;Marvel Boy&quot; limited series. Jones&#x27; other interior art credits include &quot;Wonder Woman: The Hiketeia&quot; written by Greg Rucka and Mark Millar&#x27;s &quot;Wanted&quot; published by Top Cow Productions.

Jones was intended to be the sole artist on the Grant Morrison DC limited series &quot;Final Crisis&quot;. Due to delays, Jones was assisted by artists Carlos Pacheco, Marco Rudy, and Doug Mahnke for issues #4–6, and replaced for issue #7 by Mahnke. Jones noted that &quot;Any problems completing the series are my own. I love Doug Mahnke&#x27;s art, and he would have probably been a better choice to draw this series in the first place.&quot;

Since then Jones has been mostly providing covers for DC Comics on titles such as &quot;Batman and Robin&quot;, &quot;Doc Savage&quot;, &quot;Frankenstein, Agent of S.H.A.D.E.&quot; and &quot;Mister Terrific&quot;. Writer Brian Azzarello and Jones collaborated on the &quot;Before Watchmen: Comedian&quot; limited series in 2012–2013. Jones and writer Mark Waid produced &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; for Boom! Studios in July 2015.

<doc id="663122" wikidata="Q1399669" url="?curid=663122" title="Duke of Swabia">
<text>The Dukes of Swabia were the rulers of the Duchy of Swabia during the Middle Ages. Swabia was one of the five stem duchies of the medieval German kingdom, and its dukes were thus among the most powerful magnates of Germany. The most notable family to rule Swabia was the Hohenstaufen family, who held it, with a brief interruption, from 1079 until 1268. For much of that period, the Hohenstaufen were also Holy Roman Emperors. With the death of Conradin, the last Duke of Hohenstaufen, the duchy itself disintegrated although King Rudolf I attempted to revive it for his Habsburg family in the late 13th century.

==Successor states==

In the 13th century, the Duchy of Swabia disintegrated into numerous smaller states. Some of the more important immediate successor states were:

During the following century, several of these states were acquired by the County of Württemberg or the Duchy of Austria, as marked above. In 1803 Bavarian Swabia was annexed by Bavaria and shortly afterwards became part of the Kingdom of Bavaria.

<doc id="663127" wikidata="Q281245" url="?curid=663127" title="Frederick I, Duke of Swabia">
<text>Frederick I (c. 1050 – 1105 before 21 July) was Duke of Swabia from 1079 to his death, the first ruler from the House of Hohenstaufen (&quot;Staufer&quot;).

==Life==
Frederick was the son of Frederick of Büren (c. 1020–1053), Count in the Riesgau and Swabian Count Palatine, with Hildegard of Egisheim-Dagsburg, a niece of Pope Leo IX, daughter of Otto II, Duke of Swabia and founder of the Abbey of Saint Faith in Schlettstadt, Alsace. When Frederick succeeded his father, he had Hohenstaufen Castle erected on the eponymous mountain in the Swabian Jura range, which became the ancestral seat of the dynasty. He also founded a Benedictine abbey at the site of former Lorch castle about 1100. By his mother he ruled over large Alsatian estates around Schlettstadt and Hagenau.

When during the Investiture Controversy the Swabian duke Rudolf of Rheinfelden was elected anti-king to King Henry IV of Germany, Frederick remained a loyal supporter of the ruling Salian dynasty. In turn Henry vested him with the Swabian ducal dignity in 1079 and also gave him the hand of his seven-year-old daughter Agnes of Waiblingen. Contested by Rudolf&#x27;s son Berthold of Rheinfelden and Berthold of Zähringen, Frederick only ruled over the northern parts of the Swabian duchy down to Ulm and the Danube River. Finally in 1098, he and Berthold of Zähringen reached a compromise, whereby his rival confined himself to the title of a &quot;Duke of Zähringen&quot;.

In the last years of his reign, Frederick was able to expand the Hohenstaufen territories northwards, when he assumed the office of a &quot;Vogt&quot; (reeve) of Weissenburg Abbey and the Bishopric of Speyer in Rhenish Franconia.

==Marriage and issue==
About 1086/87, Frederick married Agnes, daughter of Emperor Henry IV. They had several sons and daughters, amongst whom were:
* Frederick II (1090–1147), succeeded as Duke of Swabia in 1105, father of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa
* Conrad III, King of Germany (1093–1152), elected King of the Romans in 1138
* Berta of Boll (d. before 1142), married Adalbert of Ravenstein, Count of Elchingen, their daughter Liutgard married Conrad, Margrave of Meissen
* Heilika, who married Frederick III of Pettendorf-Lengenfeld-Hopfenche, their daughter Heilika of Pettendorf-Lengenfeld married Otto IV, Count of Wittelsbach
* Gertrud, married Hermann III of Stahleck, Count Palatine of the Rhine
* Richildis, married Hugh I, Count of Roucy
After Frederick&#x27;s death, Agnes secondly married the Babenberg margrave Leopold III of Austria in 1106. Both are buried in Klosterneuburg Monastery.

Ikaalinen became an independent municipality in 1641. The associated market town was founded in 1858. The market town and the municipality were united in 1972 and Ikaalinen became a town in 1977.

The centre of Ikaalinen is on lake Kyrösjärvi near the highway 3 (E12).

==Transport==
The private coach company OnniBus route Helsinki—Seinäjoki—Vaasa has a stop at Ikaalinen.

<doc id="663134" wikidata="Q3414020" url="?curid=663134" title="Queen &amp; Country">
<text>Queen &amp; Country is an American comic book published by Oni Press and written by Greg Rucka with various artists illustrating.

It was inspired by the British ITV television series &quot;The Sandbaggers&quot; (1978–1980), which was created and primarily written by Ian Mackintosh. Mackintosh is heavily praised in an essay by Rucka in Issue #1 of &quot;Queen &amp; Country&quot;.

==Publication history==

The first series began in March 2001 and ran for 32 issues, finishing in August 2007.

Three &quot;Queen &amp; Country: Declassified&quot; spin-off mini-series have also been published, the first two written by Rucka and the third by Antony Johnston under Rucka&#x27;s supervision. They deal specifically with the past missions of various characters. Events of the first Declassified miniseries in particular influence what happens in later issues of the main series; it is best read before &quot;Operation Stormfront&quot;.

Translated editions of the collected volumes are available in Polish, French and German, and several volumes are available in Spanish.

==Plot==

The series is centered on Tara Chace, an operative of the Special Operations Section of SIS, known as the Minders. It attempts to portray the bureaucracy and politics which the agents deal with realistically, as well as including the dangerous missions typical of the spy genre.

Other recurring characters in the series alongside Tara Chace include Director of Operations Paul Crocker, Deputy Chief of Service Donald Weldon, Chief of Service Frances Barclay (known as &quot;C&quot;), Mission Control Officer and Main Communications Officer Alexis and former Head of Special Section Tom Wallace.

<doc id="663136" wikidata="Q723809" url="?curid=663136" title="Peter Wilhelm Lund">
<text>Peter Wilhelm Lund (14 June 1801 – 25 May 1880) was a Danish Brazilian paleontologist, zoologist, and archeologist. He spent most of his life working and living in Brazil. He is considered the father of Brazilian paleontology as well as archaeology.

Lund was the first to describe dozens of species of Pleistocene megafauna, including the saber-toothed cat &quot;Smilodon populator&quot;. He also made the then ground-breaking discovery that humans co-existed with long-extinct animal species, something which possibly prompted him to terminate his scientific work. His comprehensive collections are today found at the Danish Natural History Museum in Copenhagen.

== Early life and education ==
Peter Wilhelm Lund was born into a wealthy family in Copenhagen. He showed an early interest in natural sciences and was working towards a career in medicine, but following the death of his father, his passion for natural history prompted him instead to opt for that study at the University of Copenhagen. As a student, he wrote two prize-winning dissertations. One of them, published in German, won him international recognition.

== First trip to Brazil and return to Europe ==
Due to growing tuberculosis, he traveled to Brazil in 1825 and spent the following three and a half years collecting specimens of plants, birds, and insects in the area around Rio de Janeiro, and writing about ants, snails and birds of the region.

Back in Europe in 1829, he achieved a doctoral degree at the University of Kiel, traveled to Italy and later established himself in Paris, where he came under the influence of Georges Cuvier, professor of comparative anatomy at the Muséum National d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle and the most influential naturalist and zoologist of the time.

In his &quot;Discours sur les révolutions de la surface du globe&quot; (1825), Cuvier theorized that the extinction of species was caused by natural catastrophes in certain regions of the world. When that happens, the fauna from other regions migrate to populate the now uninhabited area. This became known as catastrophism or the catastrophic theory, and would become the motto of Lund&#x27;s scientific career.

== Return to Brazil and turn to paleontology ==

In 1832 Lund returned to Brazil, never to return to Europe. He spent the first two years collecting mainly botanical specimens in the provinces of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Charles Darwin also passed through Rio in 1832, but it is unknown whether the two naturalists met.

In 1835, Lund was traveling inland through the province of Minas Gerais, and in Lagoa, an area characterised by a peculiar Karst geology, discovered several caves full of fossilized bones from extinct Ice Age megafauna species. He eventually settled in the small town of Lagoa Santa, and dedicated the next eight years to excavating, collecting, classifying and studying more than 20,000 bones of extinct species, including mastodons and ground sloths. With him was the Norwegian painter Peter Andreas Brandt who assisted him throughout his work as an illustrator. He was also assisted by the Danish botanist Eugen Warming from 1839 to 1859.

Lund was the first to describe dozens of species, among them the saber-toothed cat &quot;Smilodon populator&quot;. His exploration took place mainly in the region of Lagoa Santa, which is rich in caves and karst formations and nowadays comprises the northern part of Greater Belo Horizonte. He was also one of the first to recognize, appreciate, and record prehistoric rock and cave paintings in South America.

Then in 1843, Lund made a remarkable discovery. During a severe drought, he discovered, deep in a flooded cave, the fossilized skulls and bones of 30 humans. These individuals were found among the remains of long-extinct species, leading him to realize that humans and prehistoric animals had co-existed, something which was in frontal opposition to Cuvier&#x27;s catastrophic theory.

== Early retirement and late life ==
Only a year after his ground-breaking finds of human remains, Lund suddenly stopped the work in the caves, citing lack of resources to finance the excavations. He then donated his huge collection to the king and the people of Denmark. Alleging fragile health conditions, he decided to stay in Lagoa Santa, never to return to Europe. Whereas Lund possibly took badly to his own findings, Darwin embraced them with enthusiasm.

The next 35 years were spent exchanging letters with the curators of his collections in Copenhagen, as well as receiving the visits of young European naturalists. The complete study of his collections, &quot;E Museo Lundii&quot;, was published only in 1888.

While living in Lagoa Santa, he hosted several European naturalists, such as the Danish botanist Eugenius Warming. Lund never married and died in Lagoa Santa three weeks before reaching the age of 79.

== Legacy ==

The cave where Lund made his discovery of &quot;Lagoa Santa Man&quot; is now protected by the Sumidouro State Park, created in 1980.
The journal &quot;Lundiana&quot; is named in his honour as is a town in Lagoa Santa. Lund is considered the &quot;Father of Brazilian paleontology and archeology.&quot; His voluminous correspondence with Brazilian scientists and institutions is still uncollected.

A species of Brazilian lizard, &quot;Heterodactylus lundii&quot;, is named in his honor.
Also a flowering genus of plants from Central America was named Lundia in his honour in 1838.

== Cultural references ==
* Danish writer novel &quot;The Road to Lagoa Santa&quot; is a fictional account of Lund&#x27;s life, focussing on his early and sudden retirement which is thought to have been motivated by religious doubts caused by his scientific findings.

<text>Oni Press is an American independent comic book and graphic novel publisher based in Portland, Oregon, best known for publishing such series as &quot;Scott Pilgrim&quot; and &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;. In 2019, it became an imprint label following the company&#x27;s merger with Lion Forge Comics. The merged company, Oni–Lion Forge Publishing Group (OLFPG), is owned by Polarity. Oni Press has remained the &quot;predominant name used for publishing comics&quot; by OLFPG.

==Overview==
The company name derives from &quot;oni&quot;, the word for the ogre demons popular in Japanese folklore. 

Oni Press used the term &quot;real mainstream,&quot; coined by Stephen L. Holland of the UK comic shop Page 45, to suggest that the subject matter it publishes is more in line with the popular genres of other media, such as thrillers, romances and realistic drama. For the most part, Oni Press avoids publishing superhero titles, unless interesting creators approach these concepts from an unusual angle. However, at one point, Rich Johnston of &quot;All The Rage&quot; reported that Oni Press and Marvel Comics were creating a publishing deal for Oni creators to work on Marvel superhero characters, but the deal fell apart.

Oni Press publishes few comic books on an ongoing monthly basis - Marc Guggenheim&#x27;s &quot;Resurrection&quot;, Antony Johnston and Christopher Mitten&#x27;s &quot;Wasteland&quot; and Brian Hurrt and Cullen Bunn&#x27;s &quot;Sixth Gun&quot;. Greg Rucka&#x27;s &quot;Queen &amp; Country&quot; was published monthly from 2001 to 2007. Most of its titles are either irregular recurring miniseries, often published in four to six monthly installments, or original graphic novels.

Oni Press material initially released as comic books is usually later collected into trade paperbacks. They have published well over 100 titles, with multiple books undergoing reprints due to sustained popularity. Several of their books have won the Eisner Award including: Bryan Lee O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s &quot;Scott Pilgrim&quot;, Rick Spear and Chuck BB&#x27;s &quot;Black Metal&quot;, Hope Larson&#x27;s &quot;Grey Horses&quot;, and Greg Rucka&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and &quot;Queen &amp; Country&quot;, with many more receiving nominations.

==History==

It was founded in 1997 by Bob Schreck and Joe Nozemack with the goal of publishing comics and graphic novels they would want to read. Unsatisfied with the material that was dominating the industry, they believed firmly that sequential art could be used to tell virtually any story. Schreck left the company in 1999, leaving Oni Press owned by Nozemack and Jamie S. Rich. In 2004, Rich left the company; Oni Press was then owned by Nozemack, James Lucas Jones, and Charlie Chu.

Oni Press had a film and television production unit, Closed on Mondays, headed by Eric Gitter and located in Los Angeles, California. However, in 2015, because of creative differences originating from the geographical distance between offices, Oni and Gitter parted ways, and Oni established a new film and production arm, Oni Entertainment.

In 2016, the publisher launched Limerence Press, an imprint for erotic and sex-education comics, &quot;focused on positive, diverse, and approachable stories that reflect a wide variety of emotional and intimate experiences&quot;.

Oni Press underwent a reorganization in January 2018, with Nozemack acting as founder and chief financial officer, Jones as publisher, Chu as vice president of creative &amp; business development. and other staff also promoted. In January 2019, Sarah Gaydos was promoted to editor in chief. In March 2019, Oni was the 9th or 10th ranked publisher on Diamond&#x27;s Direct Market market share chart, by unit share or dollar share.

===Merger===
In May 2019, Oni Press merged with Lion Forge Comics, becoming Oni–Lion Forge Publishing Group (OLFPG), a subsidiary of Polarity. Nozemack stepped down as president in an advisory role. Jones remained as publisher and president, and Chu remained as vice president of creative &amp; business development. Multiple layoffs due to the merger were also reported. The company began emphasizing the Oni brand, with the Lion Forge name becoming &quot;largely dormant&quot;. In June 2021, Gaydos stepped down as editor-in-chief. Jones became interim editor-in-chief. In June 2022, Jones stated that &quot;OLFPG has a staff of roughly 30 and expects to add more&quot; and that it &quot;plans to publish 40 original graphic novels in 2022 (60, counting books delayed by supply chain issues), in addition to an extensive list of periodical comics,&quot; with Simon &amp; Schuster as their book distributor.

Following the merger with Lion Forge, which had published the memoir &quot;Gender Queer&quot; by Maia Kobabe, the company became involved in controversy and legal actions involving the book. In June 2022, Virginian politicians Tim Anderson and Tommy Altman sued Kobabe and OLFPG over &quot;Gender Queer&quot; under state law, alleging that the graphic novel was &quot;obscene for unrestricted viewing by minors&quot;. OLFPG filed a &quot;Demurrer and Motion to Dismiss&quot; which arguing the plaintiffs misrepresent the nature of the book and further lacks standing to sue.

In June 2022, Jones and Chu were fired by Polarity, followed by publicity director Tara Lehmann leaving the company. In July, the company laid off senior VP of sales and marketing Alex Segura, sales manager Henry Barajas, senior editor Amanda Meadows, and editor Jasmine Amiri. Senior vice president of games and operations Steve Ellis and associate publisher Michelle Nguyen remained with the company. Additionally, Oni Press cancelled both their floor space and their panels at the upcoming San Diego Comic-Con. Also in July 2022, Christina &quot;Steenz&quot; Stewart – an Oni freelancer and former Lion Forge editor – alleged on social media that Oni Press wasn&#x27;t paying creators their royalties, with several Oni creators responding with similar complaints.

In December 2022, Hunter Gorinson was appointed publisher and president of OLFPG. Sierra Hahn was then named the company&#x27;s new editor-in-chief in February 2023.

<doc id="663147" wikidata="Q552414" url="?curid=663147" title="Frederick II, Duke of Swabia">
<text>Frederick II (, 1090 – 6 April 1147), called the One-Eyed (), was Duke of Swabia from 1105 until his death, the second from the Hohenstaufen dynasty. His younger brother Conrad was elected King of the Romans in 1138.

==Life==
=== Early career ===
Frederick II was the eldest son of Duke Frederick I of Swabia and his wife Agnes of Waiblingen, a daughter of the Salian emperor Henry IV. He succeeded his father in 1105 and together with his brother Conrad continued the extension and consolidation of the Hohenstaufen estates. Frederick had numerous castles erected along the Rhine river and in the Alsace region. 

Frederick accompanied King Henry V on his campaign against King Coloman of Hungary in 1108. In 1110, he and Henry V embarked on an expedition to Italy, where in Rome Henry enforced his coronation by Pope Paschal II. In turn, the emperor appointed Conrad Duke of Franconia and both brothers German regents when he left for his second Italian campaign in 1116, who put down a revolt by Archbishop Adalbert of Mainz.

About 1120 Frederick married Judith, a daughter of Duke Henry IX of Bavaria and member of the powerful House of Welf. Their first son Frederick was born in 1122.

=== Salian war of succession ===
Upon the death of Emperor Henry V in 1125, the Salian dynasty became extinct. Frederick II, Henry&#x27;s nephew, stood for election as King of the Romans with the support of his younger brother Conrad and several princely houses. However, he lost in the tumultuous round of elections, led by Archbishop Adalbert of Mainz, to the Saxon duke Lothair II. Frederick at first rendered homage to the new king, however, he refused the feudal oath and insisted on the inheritance of the Salian family estates along the Middle Rhine. 

At the 1125 &quot;Hoftag&quot; diet in Regensburg, the king officially requested the surrender of the Salian possessions. After he imposed an Imperial ban on the Hohenstaufens, a conflict erupted between Frederick and his supporters, and Lothair: encouraged by Archbishop Adalbert and several princes, the king occupied Hohenstaufen lands in Upper Lorraine and Alsace. However, an attack by Welf forces on the Swabian core territory failed, like the siege of Nuremberg by Lothair in 1127. Frederick relieved the siege and moreover gained the support from his brother Conrad, who had just returned from a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. During the fighting, Frederick lost an eye, whereafter he was no longer eligible as German king.

In December 1127 Conrad declared himself King of the Romans, while the next year Duke Frederick II occupied the Salian city of Speyer. The attempt of Duke Henry X of Bavaria to capture his brother-in-law Frederick during the negotiations failed. However, afterwards the supporters of Lothair won a number of victories both in Germany and in Italy. Speyer (1129), Nuremberg (1130) and Ulm (1134) were captured; moreover Frederick&#x27;s consort Judith of Bavaria died in 1130. His second wife, Agnes of Saarbrücken, was a niece of his old enemy Adalbert of Mainz; Frederick married her about 1132. 

After Lothair was crowned emperor in 1133, Frederick saw himself stuck between the Saxon and Bavarian forces. He eventually submitted to him in the spring of 1135 at Bamberg. Both were finally reconciled and Emperor Lothair renounced further attacks against the Hohenstaufens. 

=== Last years ===
After Lothair&#x27;s death in 1137 and the following election of Conrad as King of the Romans, Frederick supported his brother in the struggle with the Welfs. According to Otto of Freising, Frederick was &quot;so faithful a knight to his sovereign and so helpful a friend to his uncle that by valor he supported the tottering honor of the realm, fighting manfully against its foes...&quot;

Duke Frederick II died in 1147 at Alzey. He was buried at the Benedictine abbey of Walburg in Alsace. His son Frederick succeeded him as Swabian duke and was elected German king (as Frederick Barbarossa) in 1152.

==Marriage and children==

<text>Atticus Kodiak is the fictional protagonist of a series of novels written by Greg Rucka. The series concerns Atticus&#x27;s career as a professional bodyguard.

==Novels featuring Atticus Kodiak==

Second in the series (1997). Atticus tries to protect the runaway daughter of his former commanding officer.

===&quot;Smoker&quot;===
Third in the series (1998). Atticus gets a chance to rehabilitate his reputation as a bodyguard when he is hired to protect a witness in a high-profile tobacco lawsuit.

===&quot;Shooting At Midnight&quot;===
Fourth in the series (1999). Atticus merely guest-stars as Rucka turns most of the narration duties over to Bridgett Logan, Atticus&#x27;s ex-girlfriend. Bridgett must deal with the demons of her past when a close friend asks Bridgett to help her murder someone.

===&quot;Walking Dead&quot;===
Seventh entry in the series (2009). While living in hiding with Alena (&quot;Drama&quot; in earlier titles), Atticus witnesses the murder of a neighbor family and kidnapping of their daughter. In effort to find the missing girl, Atticus must infiltrate the seedy world of international human trafficking.

===Major characters===

====Atticus Kodiak====
Born in San Francisco, Atticus was well-trained as a bodyguard in the Army&#x27;s Executive Protection program, and he now relies on that training in his career as a personal security consultant (or bodyguard) in New York City. The series follows Atticus as he attempts to establish himself professionally and stabilize his often rocky personal life. This is difficult, however, since his profession and personal relationships are often intertwined.

====Bridgett Logan====
Atticus&#x27; most complicated romantic relationship is with Bridgett Logan, a private investigator. Bridie&#x27;s tough exterior hides her emotional vulnerability and dangerous past. She is a devotee of Porsches, Life Savers, and Altoids, and she takes center stage in the novel &quot;Shooting At Midnight&quot;, which reveals Bridie&#x27;s past as a heroin addict. When Bridgett feels obligated to help out a friend accused of murder, she finds that old habits are the hardest to break.

====Natalie Trent====
Natalie is a professional bodyguard specializing in sniper and counter-sniper work. Thanks to her father, Elliot Trent, she is very well-off, although she does not get along with him. Atticus acknowledges that she is the best bodyguard in the group, even better than himself.

====Elliot Trent====
The owner of Sentinel, a large Manhattan-based security firm. He is Natalie&#x27;s father.

====Erika Wyatt====
Erika is the teenage daughter of Atticus&#x27; former commanding officer from his days in the Army. Atticus becomes her legal guardian, and she lives with him for several years before moving out to attend New York University (NYU). Atticus regards her as a sister, and his only family.

====Robert Moore====
Moore first appears as an operative of the SAS, but later leaves the service to become the personal bodyguard of a minor British Royal. He develops a close friendship with Atticus.

====Scott Fowler====
When Atticus requires contact with Federal authorities, he tends to contact Special Agent Scott Fowler, who Atticus&#x27;s old friend used to call &quot;Special Agent Dude.&quot;

====&quot;Drama&quot;====
&quot;Drama&quot; is the code-name for a highly talented female assassin who comes to respect Atticus&#x27; skills, character, and determination.

==Other stories set in the world of Atticus Kodiak==
There are no other stories overtly connected to the Kodiak series, other than the seven official novels. However, there are multiple stories that take place in the same fictional world by virtue of minor shared characters.

===&quot;A Fistful of Rain&quot;===
&quot;A Fistful of Rain&quot; (2003) stars Miriam &quot;Mim&quot; Bracca, a rock star with a troubled past, who returns home from a tour to have her life derailed by a stalking voyeur and a murder. Rucka has revealed &quot;there&#x27;s a very oblique link between &quot;Critical Space&quot; and &quot;Fistful&quot; - so oblique, in fact, just about everyone in the world missed it, I think. So the Kodiak universe is, in fact, the same universe as Mim Bracca&#x27;s.&quot;

===&quot;Contact and Cover&quot;===
&quot;Contact and Cover&quot; (2008) is a short story starring Tracy Hoffman, one of the detectives from &quot;A Fistful of Rain&quot;. It was published in the Michael Connelly edited collection, &quot;The Blue Religion&quot;.

===&quot;Stumptown&quot;===
&quot;Stumptown&quot; is a modern-day Detective fiction comic book that follows the cases of Dex Parios, a P.I. in Portland, Oregon. The second storyline of the series has Dex working a case for Mim Bracca, the star of &quot;A Fistful of Rain&quot;, thereby establishing its setting as that of the world of Atticus Kodiak.

<text>The Clionidae are a family of sea angels, which are a group of pelagic marine gastropods.

They resemble angels, complete with flapping &quot;wings&quot;, hence their common name. They are gelatinous, mostly transparent pteropods, and they only have shells in their embryonic stage. They are mostly very small, with the largest species (&quot;Clione limacina&quot;) reaching .

==External anatomy==
The Clionidae use winglike flaps for rhythmical locomotion, as if flying in the sea. These &quot;wings&quot; are attached to the anterior part of the body. The posterior part is gelatinous and mostly transparent.

The orange visceral sac is confined to the anterior part.

==Life habits==
Mating is carried out ventrally for mutual fertilization. The following spring, this results in a free-floating, gelatinous egg mass.

==Taxonomy==
Clionidae d&#x27;Orbigny, 1851 is unfortunately also the name of a family of sponges in the order Hadromerida, class Demospongiae. Within the ICZN there has been a proposed emendation of spelling to Clionaidae for the sponge family. The ICZN has ruled the correct name of gastropod family is Clionidae Gray, 1847, with type genus &quot;Clione&quot; Pallas, 1774.

These two subfamilies have been recognized in the taxonomy of Bouchet &amp; Rocroi (2005):
* subfamily Clioninae Rafinesque, 1815 – synonyms: Fowlerininae Pruvot-Fol, 1926
* subfamily Thliptodontinae, Kwietniewski, 1902 – synonyms: Pteroceanidae Meisenheimer, 1902; Cephalobranchiinae Pruvot-Fol, 1926

==Genera==
Genera within the family Clionidae include:

subfamily Clioninae
*&quot;Clione&quot; Pallas, 1774 – type genus
*&quot;Fowlerina&quot; Pelseneer, 1906

subfamily Thliptodontinae
* &quot;Cephalobrachia&quot; Bonnevie, 1912
* &quot;Thliptodon&quot; Boas, 1886

subfamily ?
*&quot;Paedoclione&quot; Danforth, 1907 – with the only species &quot;Paedoclione doliiformis&quot; Danforth, 1907
*&quot;Paraclione&quot; Tesch, 1903
* &quot;Thalassopterus&quot; Kwietniewski, 1910 – with the only species &quot;Thalassopterus zancleus&quot; Kwietniewski, 1910

<text>John Herbert Rees is a British right-wing journalist and government informant resident in the United States. He was active in the Western Goals Foundation and the John Birch Society.

==Biography==
Rees was born in Britain. In the early 1960s, Rees worked in a business position for the London &quot;Daily Mirror,&quot; but was fired for misusing personal accounts, according to an FBI memo. Agents in the FBI office at the London U.S. Embassy also found that during 1962 Rees, who was married and had five children, was dating an FBI stenographer, who resigned. Rees moved to the United States in 1963 for a reporting job that fell through.

Rees became the lover of &quot;Peyton Place&quot; author Grace Metalious. Metalious, who had cirrhosis from heavy drinking, changed her will hours before her death at age 39 in 1964, and left her whole estate to Rees. There was a public furor, and Rees dropped claims to the estate, which was insolvent.

Rees remarried. He launched at a job training program in Newark, New Jersey, in 1967; it was partly funded by the United States Labor Department, which cut off funding when it determined Rees had overcharged the city. Rees became a police informant in Newark. He began his newsletter &quot;Information Digest&quot; in 1967. He also marketed his new organization called National Goals, &quot;specializing in areas of education, training and law enforcement&quot;. He sought work with the FBI, which rebuffed him, determining in a 1968 internal memo that he was unethical. Rees went undercover in Chicago, covertly taping political meetings for testimony he gave to the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). He married his third wife, Sheila Louise O&#x27;Connor, and they moved to Washington in 1971. He was a police informant in Washington. She became an office manager at the National Lawyers Guild, which was representing activists and antiwar groups; he gave internal Guild documents to the FBI. In 1975, Congressman Larry McDonald hired Rees to his office staff.

Rees traded information with police and informants, publishing some of it in &quot;Information Digest&quot;. Political Research Associates said Rees&#x27;s network had better placed infiltrators among college activist campus groups than the FBI&#x27;s agents. Ross Gelbspan wrote that the FBI began to work with Rees around 1980. Rees forwarded information to the Director of Intelligence at FBI headquarters, especially when there was a credible risk to students. From there it would be forwarded to field offices. These activities were part of a network of private right-wing groups that the FBI used to gather intelligence on cults active on campus, government critics and activists opposed to the Reagan Administration&#x27;s foreign policy in Central America.

In 1976, an investigation by the New York State Assembly concluded that police had used reports published by Rees in &quot;Information Digest&quot; to assemble dossiers on many activists who had committed no crimes.

In 1979, Rees worked with McDonald and John K. Singlaub to create the Western Goals Foundation, where Rees&#x27;s title was editor. Rees set up the foundation&#x27;s computer database to track suspected radicals, and wrote many of the foundation&#x27;s published reports about domestic subversives, terrorism and communist threats. People in law enforcement sometimes leaked derogatory intelligence to Western Goals, which Rees then published in newsletters. These in turn were entered into the Congressional Record by McDonald, which shielded him from libel. Western Goals would then cite McDonald&#x27;s statements in its own public reports. Rees left Western Goals in 1983 after McDonald&#x27;s death.

Rees founded the Maldon Institute, a nonprofit funded by the Scaife family.

==Publishing==
Rees was associated with &quot;Review of the News&quot; and &quot;American Opinion&quot;, published by the John Birch Society, with which Rees was an active collaborator.

Rees published &quot;Information Digest,&quot; a newsletter that touted reporting on &quot;the operations and real capabilities of social movements and political groups&quot;. Annual subscriptions were $500. According to &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, copies circulated among intelligence officials and conservative politicians including Ronald Reagan. Rees was noted for criticizing Lyndon LaRouche and the LaRouche movement, which he wrote had &quot;taken on the characteristics more of a political cult than a political party&quot; and a cult-like &quot;blind obedience.&quot;

Rees launched and managed another newsletter, &quot;International Reports: Early Warning&quot;. Rees was also an editor for &quot;Conservative Digest&quot; magazine.

<text>Fermanagh District Council was a local council in Northern Ireland. It was created out of Fermanagh County Council and later merged with Omagh District Council in April 2015 under local government reorganisation to become Fermanagh and Omagh District Council.

The borders of the district were very similar to those of the traditional County Fermanagh, containing all of that county plus a small section of County Tyrone in the Dromore Road (Irvinestown ward) and Kilskeery Road areas. Council headquarters were in Enniskillen.

==Electoral history==

===1973 to 1981===

The elections of 1973 produced a dead heat with 10 Unionists and 10 Nationalists elected. For a while it looked as though Unionists might gain a majority due to an elected independent nationalist John Joe McCusker being ineligible, however in the end he held his seat. The deadlock raised the prospect of the British government having to intervene as both opposing blocs could not agree on the election of chairmen. Eventually however a compromise was reached for the next four years.

Nationalists gained control of the council in 1977 with an 11–9 advantage. However this came to an end with a Unionist gain in 1981 which restored the previous 10-10 balance.

The elections of this period saw many smaller parties winning seats. On the Nationalist side Unity equalled the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) with four seats in 1973 although this had declined to two seats in 1977. Their successors, the Irish Independence Party became the largest Nationalist party in terms of votes in 1981 and won four seats.

On the Unionist side, after a poor showing in 1973 when they failed to win any seats, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) failed to put up any candidates in 1977. This left the field clear for the United Ulster Unionist Party who counted this as their best area with three seats in 1977. The area was the political base of their leader Ernest Baird. However the UUUP had declined by 1981 and did not contest the elections of that year. (One of their former councillors had defected to the DUP and was re-elected as a DUP candidate.)

===1984 boundary changes===
Boundary changes came into effect for 1985. Previously the council had five electoral areas each of which elected four councillors. A change in legislation meant that it was no longer permitted to have four member electoral areas and thus despite an increase in the number of wards to 23 the number of electoral areas was reduced by one. From then on, Fermanagh District Council area consisted of four electoral areas: Enniskillen and Erne East, West and North. The council was therefore made up of 23 Councillors elected every four years.

===1985 election===
The area had been a major growth area for Sinn Féin in the four years proceeding the council elections of 1985 with the victories in Westminster by-elections of Bobby Sands and Owen Carron (although they were technically elected as Anti H-Block candidates with Sinn Féin backing). Carron was one of five assembly members elected for Sinn Féin in October 1982. The party was further boosted by the defection of sitting independent councillor JJ McCusker in 1984. A former SDLP councillor Tom Murray who had lost his seat as an independent in 1981 was also an SF candidate in 1985. Consequently, Sinn Féin made a major breakthrough winning eight seats in 1985, almost wiping out the Irish Independence party who lost three of their four seats. These gains gave Nationalists a 13–10 advantage over Unionists.

===Enniskillen and the 1989-1993 elections===
The Cenotaph bomb of 1987 had a significant and negative impact on the Sinn Féin vote as it took it 16 years to return to 1985 levels. In the 1989 elections their representation was halved to four seats. Crucially they lost two seats to the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) giving Unionists a one-seat majority on the council, which they retained in 1993.

===The 1997 election===
Nationalists were expected to regain control of the council in 1997 but ultimately could only gain one seat from Unionists. This left the council deadlocked with 11 Unionists and 11 Nationalists with an Independent Socialist (formerly Workers&#x27; Party) councillor, Davy Kettyles, holding the balance of power.

===The 2001 and 2005 elections===
Nationalists finally regained control in 2001 with 13 seats against nine Unionists and one Independent. They consolidated this lead in 2005 when the SDLP gained the seat vacated by the independent who did not stand again.

At the 2005 election the members elected were from the following political parties: nine Sinn Féin, five Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), five Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and four Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The chairman of the council was Councillor Stephen Huggett from Sinn Féin and the vice-chairman of the council was Councillor Cyril Brownlee from the DUP.

=== 2011 elections ===
==Local government structure==

The local government structure here actually pre-dated the setting up of the other 25 Local Councils in Northern Ireland in 1973 – Fermanagh County Council had merged with the district or borough councils in its area before 1973 and had created a model County Council which was seen as a good example of local pragmatic government.

In elections for the Westminster Parliament, Fermanagh is part of the Fermanagh &amp; South Tyrone constituency.

==Review of Public Administration==
Under the Review of Public Administration (RPA) the council was due to merge with Omagh District Council in 2011 to form a single council for the enlarged area totalling 2829 km2 and a population of 105,479. The next election was due to take place in May 2009, but on 25 April 2008 Shaun Woodward, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland announced that the scheduled 2009 district council elections were to be postponed until the introduction of the eleven new councils in 2011.

==Population==
The area covered by Fermanagh District Council had a population of 61,805 residents according to the 2011 Northern Ireland census.

<text>Macula (pl. maculae ) is the Latin word for &#x27;spot&#x27;. It is used in planetary nomenclature to refer to unusually dark areas on the surface of a planet or moon. They are seen on the icy surfaces of Pluto, Jupiter&#x27;s moon Europa, Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan, Neptune&#x27;s moon Triton, and Pluto&#x27;s moon Charon. The term was adopted for planetary nomenclature when high resolution pictures of Europa revealed unusual new surface features.

<text>Daniel John Gilvezan (born October 26, 1950) is an American actor, known for playing Peter Parker / Spider-Man in the 1981 animated series &quot;Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends&quot; and Bumblebee in the original 1984-1987 &quot;The Transformers&quot; series.

==Early life and career==
Gilvezan was born in St. Louis, Missouri. He graduated from Webster University with a B.A. in drama and later earned a master&#x27;s degree from The Catholic University of America. Soon afterwards he began touring with the National Players company in Washington D.C. From the mid-to-late 1970s, he appeared in plays in summer stock, dinner theater, and children&#x27;s theater. In 1973 Gilvezan performed in Wayside Theatre&#x27;s touring group along with Kathy Bates.

In 1980, while doing an on-camera commercial he met an agent from The Tisherman agency and signed on with them. His first voice-over role was as Spider-Man in &quot;Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends&quot;, which continued for three seasons.

In 1984, he voiced Bumblebee on &quot;Transformers&quot;.
According to an interview in the Transformers Collectors Club magazine, Gilvezan auditioned for both the part of Spike Witwicky and the part of Bumblebee in &quot;The Transformers&quot;, but was only given the role of Bumblebee because the producers did not want the two characters to be played by the same person. Dan Gilvezan also voiced Outback, Hot Spot and Snapdragon on the show and reprised Bumblebee in the 1986 feature film &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot;.

Gilvezan also worked on &quot;Jem&quot;, providing a few guest roles on various episodes, though he did play (with a British accent) a recurring character called Sean Harrison, one of Kimber&#x27;s many crushes, who almost proposed to her at the end of the second season.

Later, he voiced Slip Stream on &quot;G.I. Joe&quot;, Brick Bradley/Bugman on &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; for two episodes, as well as Dirk Courage in &quot;Spiral Zone&quot;. Gilvezan also played Cooler in Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s &quot;Pound Puppies&quot; TV series, Questar on &quot;Dino-Riders&quot;, Rolf in &quot;The Legend of Prince Valiant&quot; and Henry Mitchell and Ruff the Dog on the short-lived &quot;The All-New Dennis the Menace&quot; series.

Gilvezan returned to the Spider-Man Universe to lend his voice to Miguel O&#x27;Hara/Spider-Man 2099 in &quot;Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions&quot;. In an interview with 2D-X.com, he stated &quot;After a 25 year hiatus, I feel I finally have a grasp of the character. Seriously, the whole experience has been a delight.&quot; Gilvezan later reprised his role as Bumblebee in the video game &quot;&quot;.

Gilvezan voiced Pat Dugan in the direct-to-video film &quot;Justice League: Gods and Monsters&quot;.

Gilvezan is also a published author, having written books such as &quot;Drowned in the Grenadine&quot;, a fictional story of a failed actor seeking to make a comeback, and &quot;Bumblebee and Me: Life as a G1 Transformer&quot;, an autobiographical recollection of his work on the original &quot;Transformers&quot; animated series and its effect on his life and career.

==Television guest starring roles==
He has also guest starred on many television shows, including &quot;The Bernie Mac Show&quot;, &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, &quot;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&quot;, &quot;Family Ties&quot;, &quot;ALF&quot;, &quot;thirtysomething&quot;, &quot;Punky Brewster&quot;, &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot;, &quot;Newhart&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot;, &quot;Moonlighting&quot;, &quot;Normal, Ohio&quot;, &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;, &quot;Sisters&quot;, &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot;, &quot;Step by Step&quot;, &quot;Evening Shade&quot;, &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Bette&quot;, &quot;Bones&quot; and &quot;Boston Legal&quot;.

Gilvezan played a reporter on two episodes of &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, appeared as Kent Beudine on several episodes of &quot;Diagnosis Murder&quot; and starred as Skip Seville on &quot;She-Wolf of London&quot;. Between 1981 and 1988, he appeared in commercials as the spokesperson for Jack in the Box restaurants, attempting to compare their menu items to those of McDonald&#x27;s and other fast-food chains, to no avail; hence the slogan of &quot;There&#x27;s No Comparison&quot; was used at the time.

<doc id="663180" wikidata="Q3075332" url="?curid=663180" title="Terminating vista">
<text>In urban design, a terminating vista is a building or monument that stands at the end or in the middle of a road, so that when one is looking up the street the view ends with the site.

==Function==
Terminating vistas are considered an important method of adding aesthetic appeal to a city, and to emphasize important structures or monuments. Common terminating vistas include government buildings, war memorials, courthouses and other important structures. Standing at the end of a street adds grandeur to a structure, and legislature and palaces are thus often placed in such a locale. Also, especially on east–west streets, terminating vistas provide sunshade for pedestrians.

A notable disadvantage of terminating vistas is that they make traffic more complicated and prevent a simple grid system of city blocks. To accommodate them, large traffic circles or other techniques have to be employed to manage traffic around the monument. Cities on a grid system such as New York City thus have few terminating vistas. A prominent NYC exception is the controversial MetLife Building, which was built &quot;on top&quot; of Park Avenue.

==Examples of terminating vistas==
A city particularly known for its terminating vistas is Paris, where many of the largest streets end in monuments and structures such as the Arc de Triomphe, Palais Garnier or the Panthéon. Another well-known example is Washington, D.C., where, most notably, the United States Capitol provides the terminating vista for North, South, and East Capitol Streets, as well as the National Mall and either side of Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland, and Pennsylvania Avenues (which are all bisected by the Capitol, turning into pedestrian walkways around the edifice). Other notable terminating vistas include Buckingham Palace, located at the end of The Mall, and St. Peter&#x27;s Square, at the end of Via della Conciliazione.

Philadelphia&#x27;s City Hall is another example, situated on Penn Square where Broad and Market Streets intersect. The two streets form the north–south and east–west axes of the city&#x27;s core grid, leaving the large masonry structure visible from all sections of the city.

An unusual situation exists on Bay Street in Toronto, where the clock tower of Old City Hall lies at the northern end of the segment south of Queen Street West. However, Bay Street is a through street that curves to the west, intersecting Queen Street West at a 45-degree angle before curving back north along the western edge of Old City Hall and continuing towards Davenport Road. In a similar manner, the Thomson Building and Munich Re Centre office towers act as a vista for the northern section of Bay Street heading south.

<text>In cryptography, DEAL (Data Encryption Algorithm with Larger blocks) is a symmetric block cipher derived from the Data Encryption Standard (DES). Its design was presented by Lars Knudsen at the SAC conference in 1997, and submitted as a proposal to the AES contest in 1998 by Richard Outerbridge.

DEAL is a Feistel network which uses DES as the round function. It has a 128-bit block size and a variable key size of either 128, 192, or 256 bits; with 128-bit and 192-bit keys it applies 6 rounds, or 8 rounds with 256-bit keys. It has performance comparable to Triple DES, and was therefore relatively slow among AES candidates.

<doc id="663186" wikidata="Q552000" url="?curid=663186" title="Flash Thompson">
<text>Eugene &quot;Flash&quot; Thompson is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, the character first appeared in &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #15 (August 1962).

Flash Thompson is a star high school football player, who mercilessly bullies his high school classmate Peter Parker, but greatly admires Spider-Man, an irony in which the superhero takes some gratification. In time, they become close friends in college after Flash matures and he later discovers Peter is Spider-Man. After graduation, he joins the United States Army, but becomes haunted by his combat experiences, leading to alcoholism. After losing both of his legs in the Iraq War, Flash Thompson turns into the superhero Agent Venom after being bound to the Venom symbiote, which he controls via drugs. Eventually during an argument between him and Eddie Brock regarding the Venom symbiote, he became the new host of the Anti-Venom symbiote, causing him to assume his current alias of Agent Anti-Venom.

Thompson has appeared in several other media adaptations. Notably, he was portrayed by Joe Manganiello in the Sam Raimi &quot;Spider-Man&quot; trilogy, Chris Zylka in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, and Tony Revolori in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

==Publication history==
Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, Flash Thompson first appeared in &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #15 (August 1962), the same issue Spider-Man first appeared in. He was a regular character in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; series for its first four years, leaving the cast in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #47 (April 1967) to serve in the Vietnam War. Though he reappeared in the comic a few times while on leave, he did not return to the regular cast until issue #105 (Feb. 1972).

Though the relationship between Flash Thompson and Spider-Man&#x27;s alter ego Peter Parker gradually became more cordial over the years, the major turning point towards their becoming friends was in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #138 (Nov. 1974), in which Thompson lets Parker room with him after all his other friends and acquaintances turned him away.

Thompson&#x27;s childhood is explored in &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; #-1 (July 1997), titled &quot;That Thompson Boy&quot;. Writer J. M. DeMatteis commented, &quot;Despite our human tendency to want to fit people into convenient pigeonholes, no one is any one thing all the time. The main point of &#x27;That Thompson Boy&#x27; was to show that there were other sides to Flash, to look behind the curtain and see the vulnerability, and depth, that was there. &#x27;Flash&#x27; is a mask. Eugene is a complex, wounded human being. I think the character&#x27;s history, even going back to Stan [Lee]&#x27;s stories, is a constant battle between the two, a seeking to find balance.&quot;

The character made his first appearance as the new incarnation of Venom in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #654 (February 2011). A second volume of &quot;Venom&quot; started in May 2011 with Flash Thompson as the titular character. As Venom, he appeared as a regular character in the 2010–2013 &quot;Secret Avengers&quot; series, from issue #23 (April 2012) through its final issue, #37 (March 2013). As Venom, he appears in the 2012 &quot;Red Hulk&#x27;s Thunderbolts&quot; series by Daniel Way and Steve Dillon. After the Superior Spider-Man event, Agent Venom is seen in space in &quot;The Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; vol. 3, #14. He was eventually spun off into his own solo series, &quot;Venom: Space Knight&quot;, written by Robbie Thompson and drawn by Ariel Olivetti. It was canceled after 13 issues. In the premier issue of &quot;Venom&quot; volume 3, Flash Thompson is seen without the symbiote.

==Fictional character biography==
===High school===

Eugene &quot;Flash&quot; Thompson is the nephew of actress Lea Thompson and a bully of high school classmate Peter Parker. Flash was physically abused by his alcoholic father Harrison Thompson, leading to Flash&#x27;s own violent, bullying nature. Thompson dubs Peter with the derogatory nickname &quot;Puny Parker&quot; and humiliates Parker daily at school. Not knowing that Parker is Spider-Man, he forms the first &quot;Spider-Man Fan Club&quot; and vocally supports his idol, even criticizing and insulting J. Jonah Jameson in person for the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;″s anti-Spider-Man editorials. When Spider-Man is seen committing robberies, Flash is one of the few to stand up for him claiming that he could still be innocent. When it is revealed that Spider-Man was framed by Mysterio, Flash boasts about how he is always right. Peter, who openly states that he would not &quot;trust [Spider-Man] any further than I can throw him&quot;, takes some secret pleasure in that Flash supported his alter-ego.

In a very early issue, Flash and Peter squared off for a boxing match in the school gym. Initially expecting an easy victory, Flash was astonished to discover that he simply could not lay a hand on Peter (due to his opponent&#x27;s enhanced speed and reflexes), and a single tap from Parker&#x27;s fist knocked him clear out of the ring. After this episode, Flash&#x27;s bullying was restricted mostly to verbal harassment. Over the next few years, as the two became rivals for Liz Allan&#x27;s affections, Flash was willing to confront Peter only when backed up by his friends. Peter began to laugh off his threats with good-natured comebacks (much to Flash&#x27;s annoyance as well as bewilderment). This subtle reversal of their positions was typical of Lee-Ditko character developments in the title.

Towards the end of Ditko&#x27;s run on the title, Flash was employed mainly as comic relief, more a local buffoon than a serious threat. Major changes in his personality took place subsequently to &quot;&#x27;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #39, when John Romita, Sr. took over as artist for &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;. Following Romita&#x27;s take in place, Flash was made into a more sympathetic character and his clean-cut image was similarly emphasized to give him an &quot;All-American&quot; persona.

===College and adulthood===

After Flash Thompson entered Empire State University, his relationship with Peter Parker became progressively less hostile. While the two still traded the occasional insult, Flash had grown to respect Peter&#x27;s intelligence and was surprised by his popularity with women, particularly Gwen Stacy and Mary Jane Watson. Both Flash and Peter were friends with the wealthy Harry Osborn. Harry&#x27;s presence served to defuse the tension between the former rivals.

While in university, Flash joined the United States Army and serves in the Vietnam War (although this was later retconned to unspecified overseas conflict due to Marvel&#x27;s floating timeline). Unlike many students of the time, Flash was never conscripted—instead, he volunteers for service of his own free will. Although Flash was absent from the strip for months at a time, his frequent stateside visits kept him familiar with the readers. He returned from the war a decorated hero. Flash&#x27;s tour of duty profoundly changed him from a reckless and immature youth to a tormented and conflicted man. Finding no comfort in his military decorations, Flash turned to alcohol for years.

While in Vietnam, Flash&#x27;s unit bombed an ancient temple whose acolytes had earlier sheltered Flash when he was wounded. Flash tried and failed to stop them. When he returned to America, he dropped his antagonism toward Peter. Peter, in turn, began to respect Flash&#x27;s newfound maturity and the two became close. However, Flash soon finds himself tailed by mysterious assassins, former acolytes of the temple who thought that Flash had betrayed them. Spider-Man held off the assassins long enough for Flash to explain his side of the story. Sha Shan, the leader of the assassins, forgave Flash and even dated him for a while, but left him when she found out he was cheating on her. When Sha Shan was attacked by the Hobgoblin, Flash made the mistake of insulting the villain on television. Hobgoblin took revenge by abducting Flash and framing him as Hobgoblin&#x27;s true identity. Spider-Man was aghast that his old friend was a villain, but Flash was legally exonerated when Hobgoblin&#x27;s true identity was revealed. It was around this period that Flash Thompson would serve as best man at the wedding of Parker and Mary Jane.

After a bout of severe depression, Flash went drunk-driving and was badly injured in a car crash. Soon afterward Norman Osborn offered him a job at Oscorp as his personal aide to annoy Peter. Not knowing the reasons behind this, Flash became loyal to Norman for giving him a second chance and turning his life around. During this time, Flash met the hero Prodigy, not realizing he was also Spider-Man in disguise. Later, as part of a plan of driving Spider-Man to murderous violence by attacking his family and friends, Osborn kidnapped Flash (under the pretense of picking him up from an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting), force-feeds him whiskey and has him crash a truck into Midtown High School, where Peter works. Flash survived, thanks to his excellent physical condition, but he suffered severe brain damage that left him in a coma. Liz, although widowed and raising her son Normie all on her own, became Flash&#x27;s caretaker, and hired a full-time nurse to care for him. May Parker had come up with the idea to have Flash moved into Peter&#x27;s apartment building so he could be among friends in the hopes it would aid in his recovery. Peter, blaming himself for what happened to Flash, was eager to help and started spending his free time with him, lending emotional support and companionship. Although Flash remained in a largely unresponsive state after coming out of the coma, Peter&#x27;s constant companionship led to his condition slowly improving over time.

Flash awakens from his coma during &quot;The Other&quot; story arc. Flash takes a job as the physical education teacher at Midtown High School, where Peter teaches science. However, Flash suffers from severe memory gaps and again treats Peter like a nerd and picks on him, as he did in their high school days. Flash also flirts with Miss Arrow, unaware that she is a villain there to attack Peter. When Peter unmasks himself as Spider-Man, Flash dismisses it as a trick. But after witnessing Peter fighting with Daniel Berkhart and Francis Klum, Flash&#x27;s memories come back to him and he re-establishes his friendship with Peter. Flash briefly appeared at the beginning of the &quot;Brand New Day&quot; story arc, attending a welcome home party for Harry. Flash and the rest of the world&#x27;s population no longer remembers that Peter is Spider-Man, due to the machinations of the demon Mephisto.

===Iraq War===
After the events of &quot;One More Day&quot;, Flash Thompson willingly leaves his place as a P.E. instructor to rejoin the Army and fight in the Iraq War out of patriotic zeal, inspired by the selfless life of his lifelong idol Spider-Man. He is still in a close friendship with Peter Parker, as he is seen, lying in his hospital camp bed, with a greeting card by his best friend, and an iPod loaded by Peter himself with &quot;Christmas in Fallujah&quot;.

Flash&#x27;s platoon is ambushed, and Flash suffers several bullet wounds in both legs but continues on in an attempt to save his superior officer from danger. He willingly endangers himself, reasoning that Spider-Man had often committed the same sacrifices for everyone else, and glad to have had the opportunity to imitate him. His actions further damage his legs. This results in the need for them to be amputated below the knees. Flash&#x27;s sacrifice is enough to earn him a recommendation for the Medal of Honor. He returns to New York, only to shock Peter with the loss of his legs. He reveals to Peter that Spider-Man was his inspiration in Iraq. Harry rents a condo just for Flash, to help him out. He later competes in a disabled athletes sporting event at the local YMCA, managing to come in first place.

Flash later accepts an offer to join Mayor Jameson&#x27;s office of veteran&#x27;s affairs. He attends the wedding of May Parker. When the Chameleon (disguised as Peter) meets Flash at the subsequent press conference, he cruelly mocks him, calling him &quot;puny Flash&quot;. Flash is seen going through the so-called &quot;stages of grief&quot; backwards, even so far as to use dangerous experimental procedures to regain his legs, but seems to come to terms with his condition, thanks to the support of his friends, family, and his new rehabilitation trainer Sha Shan.

===Agent Venom===

In a January 2011 interview with Newsarama, Flash Thompson was revealed &quot;by accident&quot; as the new host of Venom. Marvel confirmed Flash was to have his own comic using a military style version of Venom. Despite previously seeming to come to terms with the loss of his legs, Flash jumps at the dangerous offer of being bonded to the Venom symbiote, as the alien will be able to replace his legs with its own bio-mass, allowing him to walk again. He was written as a hero working for the military, and encountered many heroes and villains of the Marvel Universe. He made his premiere as Agent Venom in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #654 (Feb. 2011), and continues in his own &quot;Agent Venom&quot; ongoing series following the special &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #654.1.

He cannot stay bonded to the Venom symbiote for more than 48 hours at a time, or the symbiote may gain complete control over him. The consequences of this are first seen when the suit causes Flash to go berserk and brutally slaughter a group of enemy operatives during his second mission, and again during a brawl with the Jack O&#x27;Lantern, ending with the suit putting a grenade in Jack O&#x27;Lantern&#x27;s mouth. While on a mission in the Savage Land, Flash finds himself being hunted by Kraven the Hunter who mistakes him for Spider-Man.

During the 2011 &quot;Spider-Island&quot; storyline, Agent Venom is sent in to capture the Spider-King that is fighting Firestar and Gravity. Agent Venom manages to capture the Spider-King who he later discovers is Steve Rogers under the influence of The Queen. Flash uses the symbiote to reform himself as the Spider-King to track the infestation to its source. The Queen and the Jackal send him to kill Anti-Venom because he is curing people who have gained spider-powers, but his superiors order him to take him to Reed Richards to help develop a cure. Flash and the Venom symbiote fight each other because Flash wants to bring Anti-Venom to Richards and the symbiote wants to kill Anti-Venom for previously rejecting it. This leads to Venom and Anti-Venom fighting. Venom wins the fight and delivers Anti-Venom to Richards. Venom teams up with Red Hulk, X-23, Ghost Rider, and Johnny Blaze to fight Blackheart.

He joins the &quot;Secret Avengers&quot; as Agent Venom. As an Avenger, Flash apprehends the Human Fly, but the Human Fly escapes via a prisoner transport to the Raft when the new Hobgoblin attacks the transport trying to kill the Human Fly for stealing money from the Kingpin. Flash tries to assassinate the third Crime Master for threatening his family, but Eddie Brock attacks him as he is about to fire. This causes the Crime Master to have his new Savage Six attack Flash and Betty Brant. While trying to protect Betty from Jack O&#x27;Lantern he reveals his identity to her. Thunderbolt Ross recruits Venom to be part of his Thunderbolts team.

Flash relocates to Philadelphia after fighting the U-Foes there. While trying to capture a serial killer infected with some of the alien technology the U-Foes were trying to sell, so Beast could try to cure the man, he is attacked by Toxin. While in Philadelphia, he adopts a protege in his teenage neighbor Andrea &quot;Andi&quot; Benton, who upon bonding to a duplicate of the symbiote becomes the antiheroine Mania.

Flash returns to New York when Betty Brant contacts him with information that the Crime Master has resurfaced. Flash infiltrates and attacks Crime Master and his men until the Superior Spider-Man (Otto Octavius&#x27;s mind in Spider-Man&#x27;s body) and his Spiderlings intervene. Crime Master then reveals himself to be a small-time hood who had purchased the name and mask from Hobgoblin and turns himself in. Superior Spider-Man then turns his attention to Agent Venom with the intent on destroying him. Flash escapes in a puff of smoke and hides in a hospital before going to Peter&#x27;s apartment. Seizing opportunity, &quot;Peter Parker&quot; invites Flash to his company to give Flash prosthetic legs. After doing so, Superior Spider-Man detains the symbiote in a cage from which it soon breaks free and bonds to Superior Spider-Man to be the Superior Venom. The symbiote tries to flee back to Flash, but Superior Spider-Man keeps it for himself, even going as far as to injure Cardiac when Cardiac tries to separate them. Iron Man arrives to Parker Industries to assist both Cardiac and Flash to take him to the battle-zone and reunite him with the symbiote. The Avengers are starting to fall against the power of Superior Venom who boasts about his superiority until Iron Man arrives to distract him allowing Flash (wearing Iron Man&#x27;s armor) attack from behind and attempt to retake the symbiote. With the unexpected assistance from Spider-Man&#x27;s conscience, the Venom symbiote finally leaves Superior Spider-Man&#x27;s body and reunites with Flash, bonding together again. The Avengers are still in disbelief about Superior Spider-Man&#x27;s argument until they ask Flash to check his mind-link with the symbiote to see anything wrong about Superior Spider-Man&#x27;s motives. Flash replies that he sees &quot;two different radio stations playing in the same frequency&quot;.

Following the conclusion of &quot;The Superior Spider-Man&quot; and the return of Peter Parker as Spider-Man, the latter learns that his friend Flash is Venom and became angry at the Avengers that they did not tell him. The Avengers confess that because Flash was a good soldier and the secret identities in the Avengers&#x27; rules goes both ways.

Seeking to maintain a connection with the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Avengers placed Venom on said team as their new envoy. At a point the Symbiote began to act strangely considering anyone as an enemy as something was tapping into its mind signalling it. Flash became extremely worried and, since he was left behind when the other Guardians were captured, he began to try to find a way back to Earth which the Symbiote encouraged. However, in its fear it killed people if they refused. Eventually Gamora found them but they attacked her thinking her as an enemy. Star-Lord manages to subdue the Symbiote but Flash goes into a coma. The Symbiote breaks out on the ship and takes the ship to its planet of origin. The planet of Symbiotes explains to the Guardians their origins of the Klyntar. However, Flash and the Venom Symbiote have created the perfect savior the Symbiotes want. This heals the Symbiote and allows Flash to tap into the full potential of the Symbiote.
Venom then becomes the new intergalactic ambassador of Earth and an Agent of the Cosmos.

During the 2016 &quot;Civil War II&quot; storyline, Flash is called back to Earth along with the other Guardians, during which he comes into conflict with Spider-Man, and repeatedly subdues him for not being the Spider-Man he knows. Prompting Miles to electrocute him with the Venom Blast, which blasted him into the open. Andrea, who is host to the Mania symbiote, becomes more ruthless in her actions to the point of killing everyone she encountered. Venom manages to separate the symbiote from Mania, and absorb it into the Venom symbiote, though Andrea is corrupted by a demonic sigil called the Hell-Mark. Flash resolves to remain on Earth to care for Andi until he can find a way to remove the Hell-Mark permanently.

Venom is later shown to have been somehow separated from Flash and it finds a new host in Lee Price. It is eventually revealed that Flash was separated from Venom during a fight with an FBI agent outfitted with high-tech battle suit. The agent used a special weapon that agitated the Symbiote and sent it into a crazed state, which led to it fleeing into the city, where it eventually encountered Price, then reunites with Eddie Brock.

===Agent Anti-Venom and death===
During the &quot;Venom Inc.&quot; arc, Flash talks to Mania through her crimefighting, before she is taken down by Lee Price and a gang of thugs. Price is making good on his promise to re-take the Venom symbiote as he forcibly separates Mania from her symbiote and takes it himself. Meanwhile, Brock struggles to cope with the symbiote which has become increasingly violent and difficult to control. He turns to Alchemax to make a serum to help him out, but the medicine being created there is still experimental and may have some side effects. As Flash attempts to find Brock and get the symbiote back, Spider-Man is attempting to get rid of the symbiote once and for all, bringing the three together in a fantastic showdown as both Brock and Flash attempt to convince the symbiote to bond to them. As they struggle, Spider-Man chooses to douse them both with a vat of the Anti-Venom Serum. Instead of destroying the symbiotes, a new Anti-Venom arises: Flash Thompson. After Flash, Mania, Spider-Man, Black Cat, and Venom defeat Price, Flash entrusts the Venom symbiote to Eddie and goes back to heroics as Agent Anti-Venom.

In the &quot;Go Down Swinging&quot; storyline, Norman Osborn returns with the Carnage symbiote bonded to him, making him the Red Goblin. He attacks New York City, and Silk, Clash, Spider-Man, Human Torch and Agent Anti-Venom tried to stop him. Flash uses his Anti-Venom to heal any of Peter&#x27;s friends and family that were infected by the Carnage symbiote, and discovers Spider-Man&#x27;s secret identity in the process. Norman critically wounds Flash, who can no longer heal due to using the Anti-Venom to save the others. Peter offers to use the Venom symbiote to heal him, but Flash refuses, worrying that it would die with him and knows Peter needs an edge over Norman&#x27;s new powers. He dies in Peter&#x27;s arms and is honored by Peter and his friends at his funeral.

Maker later obtains a piece of the symbiote taken from Flash&#x27;s time as Agent Venom, which contains a copy of his consciousness. The sample is dubbed as a codex by the Maker. The brain dead symbiote absorbs the sample during Venom&#x27;s escape from Project Oversight, and with Eddie Brock&#x27;s permission the copy takes control and transforms into Agent Venom. Flash&#x27;s consciousness burns out shortly after.

===King in Black===

It was later revealed however, that Flash still existed within the Symbiote hive-mind. He joined Rex Strickland&#x27;s army of former symbiote hosts when the dark symbiote god Knull started invading Earth, recovering his Anti-Venom symbiote replica. When Eddie Brock died and joined Rex&#x27;s army, Flash was there to greet him. When Eddie&#x27;s son Dylan and Thor began freeing hosts from their symbiotes and fighting Knull, a red gash appeared - formed from the dissolved symbiotes of the recently freed hosts - and Flash followed Eddie and Rex through it into the core of the Hive-Mind, the place where they were before having been a &quot;purgatory&quot; for codices. The three of them noticed that the symbiotes freed from Knull&#x27;s control were being imprisoned and formulated a plan to bond to them the way Flash once had the Venom symbiote. Despite Eddie&#x27;s protests, Flash volunteered to free the imprisoned symbiotes and &quot;download&quot; himself into one of them, acknowledging this was his mission from the beginning and that Eddie was a hero too. Their plan worked, and Flash was incarnated in the world of the living as a symbiote dragon resembling his Anti-Venom symbiote. Informed by Eddie of what had happened when Cletus Kasady&#x27;s corpse had bonded to a symbiote-dragon, Flash flew to the cemetery where his body had been buried and reanimated himself, bursting from his grave in a recreation of his human form.

==Powers and abilities==
The Venom symbiote grows a pair of legs for him while he has on the suit. Due to his military training and former boxing career, Flash is an experienced hand-to-hand fighter and a trained marksman. After later gaining the power of the Anti-Venom symbiote, Flash inherits the healing abilities of this suit as well, along with the ability to heal others&#x27; physical injuries, and the original Anti-Venom&#x27;s cleansing powers.

==Other versions==
===Amalgam Comics===
In the Amalgam Comics universe, Flash is a member of the New York Special Crimes Unit. He is also highly distrustful of Spider-Boy, believing him to be in league with the villains he fights.

===Heroes Reborn===
In the &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; event, a change in the timeline results in a continuity in which the Squadron Supreme are Earth&#x27;s mightiest heroes while the Avengers never came to be. In this continuity, Flash unintentionally stops Peter from becoming Spider-Man by pushing him out of the way of the radioactive spider right before it bites him. After attending Capitol University, he ran for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, but lost to Kyle Richmond. While attending the University, he fell in love with Gwen Stacy. His obsession with her drove him mentally unstable, leading him to kill her stalker, Miles Warren, and succeed him as the new Jackal. He eventually deduced that Gwen was the vigilante Nightbird and began killing people connected to her. Gwen eventually defeated him and had him committed to Ravencroft Asylum, where no one believed him when he claimed that Gwen was Nightbird.

===House of M===
During the 2005 House of M storyline, Flash is a commentator for the program &quot;Sapien Deathmatch&quot; in which sentient beings fight violent battles for the entertainment of the mutant ruling class. In his first noted performance, Flash narrates a battle between a robotic Sentinel and the human Tony Stark.

===MC2===
In the MC2 continuity (the alternate future of Spider-Girl), Flash Thompson is now on the faculty of his old high school. He is the coach of the girls&#x27; basketball team. He married Felicia Hardy, but they later divorced after they had two children (Felicity and Eugene Jr.). He still is unaware of the fact that Peter Parker was Spider-Man, and is similarly unaware that Peter&#x27;s daughter is Spider-Girl. Felicity, on the other hand, is aware of all of this and briefly assumed the Scarlet Spider identity in attempt to partner with Spider-Girl.

===&quot;Spider-Man: Life Story&quot;===
&quot;Spider-Man: Life Story&quot; features an alternate continuity where the characters age naturally, with the story beginning with Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man in 1962. In 1966, Flash volunteers to serve as a soldier in the Vietnam War. When Peter asks him why he&#x27;d be willing to go after the effects the previous war had on his father, Flash says that he believes it&#x27;s what Spider-Man would do. Flash is later killed in action in 1974, leading Peter to question if he could have saved Flash by volunteering as well.

===&quot;Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane&quot;===
In &quot;Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane&quot;, Flash is the star football quarterback at Midtown High. Flash bullies Peter and refers to him as Puny Parker. Flash recently started dating Liz Allan again; this ended after she dumped him at homecoming for declaring his love to Mary Jane in front of the whole school.

===Spider-Verse===

* On Earth-51412, Flash&#x27;s counterpart Gene is in a relationship with Sarah Jane (this universe&#x27;s Mary Jane) and bullies Patton Parnell (this universe&#x27;s Peter Parker).
* Earth-11&#x27;s Flash Thompson starts off having a friendly relationship with Penelope Parker (Earth-11&#x27;s Peter Parker), even before the spider bites her and after she becomes Spider-Girl.
* A version of Captain Spider appears as one of the spider-themed heroes recruited by Spider-UK to help combat the Inheritors. He is killed by Morlun.

===Spider-Island===
Flash Thompson (as Agent Venom) is the main protagonist in this Secret Wars Warzone version of &quot;Spider Island&quot;. He leads the resistance after most of the heroes and citizens have been mutated into spider monsters by the Spider Queen. Inspired by the sacrifice of Spider-Man, he leads the resistance (consisting of Werewolf by Night, Jessica Drew, and Vision) into stopping the Queen. His plans to release some heroes from the Spider Queen&#x27;s control by mutating them into other monsters (such as Curt Connors&#x27; Lizard formula and Morbius&#x27; vampire formula) succeed and he is able to get monstrous versions of Captain America, Captain Marvel, the Hulk, and Iron Man on his side. When they go get Stegron to help in the cause, they discover Spider-Man&#x27;s alive and Flash finds out he&#x27;s Peter Parker. They rescue both to help in their cause. Flash eventually leads the rebellion to successfully stop the Spider Queen, but at the cost of his own life (due to requiring the symbiote to possess the Spider Queen to take her down). Peter becomes the new baron of the place and plans to honor Flash&#x27;s memory.

===Marvel Adventures===
In the &quot;Marvel Adventures&quot; continuity, Jack Russel&#x27;s family home is in Queens, New York. This brings Werewolf into conflict with Spider-Man after he reluctantly turns the somewhat innocent Flash Thompson into a werewolf. Fortunately Dr. Strange&#x27;s knowledge of Romanian lycanthropy saves Flash.

===Venomverse===
In Venomverse a version of Agent Venom is part of the Venoms army gathered by a Venomized Doctor Strange to fight the Poisons. He tries to calm down both Eddie (from the main universe) and Spider-Man (from a universe who didn&#x27;t get rid of the symbiote), but they&#x27;re attacked by the Poisons and he himself is killed by a Poison Hulk.

===Ultimate Marvel===

The Ultimate Marvel incarnation of the character is Fredrick &quot;Fred&quot; Thompson, a high school jock who bullies Peter Parker and is friends with fellow student Kenny &quot;Kong&quot; McFarlane. Unlike most versions, he does not idolize Spider-Man (something that Kenny does instead) and is generally portrayed unsympathetically. When Flash challenges Peter to a fight, Peter merely blocks a punch from Flash and manages to break his hand. When Peter joins the basketball team, Flash&#x27;s attitude changes, on account of his tendency towards loyalty to his teammates. When Flash suddenly wants to talk to Peter alone for a moment on at least two occasions, Peter turns him down rather furiously, believing he just wanted to bully in private. After Gwen Stacy&#x27;s death, it is revealed that Flash had a crush on Gwen and was actually trying to ask Peter for help in approaching Gwen for a date. During Silver Sable&#x27;s hunt of Spider-Man, Flash is kidnapped after being mistaken by the Wild Pack for Spider-Man, having only moments before disappeared into an alley Flash happened to be standing in. After realizing their mistake, the group considers killing him but Flash is able to escape. This experience gives Flash a new level of popularity within the school, especially after a TV movie is made about his ordeal. After Peter&#x27;s apparent death as Spider-Man, Flash realizes that he is the only one who did not know that his former bullying victim and the young hero are the same person.

===&quot;What If?&quot;===

In &quot;What if the Radioactive Spider Had Bitten Someone Else?&quot;, Flash is one of three characters bitten by the radioactive spider which is behind the Spider powers; the other two are Betty Leeds and John Jameson. After inadvertently killing the wrestler Crusher Hogan in the ring due to his underestimation of his new strength, Flash begins to fight crime under the name Captain Spider, but his career comes to a brutal stop when he fights the Vulture, is knocked out of the sky. Without any web-shooters to save him, he falls to his death. Only Peter bears witness to his demise.

In &quot;What if Peter Parker Had to Destroy Spider-Man?&quot; a darker twist to the &quot;Captain Spider&quot; story is depicted, with Flash still possessing his aggressive, selfish bully attitude from his early appearances. As Peter witnessed the spider-bite, he becomes Flash&#x27;s confidant, and Flash pressures Peter to make Flash a costume and weapons. Not wanting Flash to harm anyone permanently, and motivated by his concern for innocents after Mary Jane Watson is killed in a botched burglary, Peter devises the web-shooters, but Flash uses his powers to become a super-criminal called The Spider. A pep talk from Aunt May and Uncle Ben inspires Peter to do something, beginning with him inadvertently saving Otto Octavius from the accident that transformed him into Doctor Octopus in canon. With Octavius&#x27;s aid, Peter uses his scientific genius to create a robotic exo-skeleton similar to Doc Ock&#x27;s familiar tentacles, along with other methods that allow him to counter Flash&#x27;s powers and incapacitate him. Later, Mister Fantastic removes Flash&#x27;s powers (noted to only be possible because Flash was captured early enough that the changes weren&#x27;t infused into his DNA) and remarks that Peter has a bright future ahead, using technology rather than biological powers.

In &quot;What if J. Jonah Jameson Adopted Spider-Man?&quot;, JJJ adopts Peter after Chameleon&#x27;s attempt to hijack a NASA shuttle resulted in the deaths of Aunt May, John Jameson, and Chameleon himself. Jameson hires Flash to be Peter&#x27;s bodyguard, writing off their antagonism as youthful energy. Because Jameson remains convinced that Spider-Man is to blame for the shuttle accident, he hires Spencer Smythe to create the Spider-Slayers, only for Peter to sabotage them in secret. At the demonstration, Flash notices that Smythe has also created the Scorpion suit and takes it for himself, hoping to protect Spidey and possibly become a hero in his own right. However, the serum affects Flash&#x27;s mind, causing him to go berserk, and Peter (now maskless) goes to try to bring him down. Blinded by rage and addled by the serum, Flash refuses to believe that &quot;Puny Parker&quot; could be Spider-Man and attacks, nearly killing Peter until Jameson intervenes using a remote-controlled Spider-Slayer robot and shoots Flash with an antidote dart.

In &quot;What if Flash Thompson became Spider-Man?&quot;, the Unseen depicts another example of a timeline in which Flash Thompson is Spider-Man. In this timeline, just as Peter did, Flash starts out in wrestling before taking on a &#x27;heroic&#x27; role when he stops the burglar who would have killed Ben Parker, with J. Jonah Jameson finding solace in praising Spider-Man as a hero after the existing system fails to save his son from the shuttle accident that Peter would have saved him from in canon. Flash eventually drops out of school to act full-time as Spider-Man, living in a trailer park with no apparent official income. Peter still becomes Spider-Man&#x27;s photographer through more conventional methods, but when May Parker suffers serious complications and requires a rare drug to treat her disease, Peter tracks down Flash to ask for his help, only for Flash to accidentally kill Peter when he throws him into the wall of his trailer in a rage in the blind belief that Peter was making him look bad out of jealousy due to their history. Forced to face the fact that he is actually a brutal criminal rather than his perceived role as a hero after seeing the error of his ways, Flash takes action to confront Doctor Octopus and acquire the medicine for May, but subsequently turns himself in for Peter&#x27;s death.

<text>WWE Armageddon was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), a professional wrestling promotion based in Connecticut. The event was created in 1999, when the promotion was still called the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, renamed to WWE in 2002). It was held every December except in 2001, as that year, Vengeance replaced Armageddon as the event&#x27;s name was thought to be insensitive following the September 11 attacks, although Armageddon was reinstated in 2002 with Vengeance moving up to July. 

To coincide with the brand extension introduced in 2002, the event was made exclusive to the Raw brand in 2003 before becoming SmackDown-exclusive from 2004 to 2006. Following WrestleMania 23 in 2007, brand-exclusive PPVs were discontinued. The final event was held in 2008, with TLC: Tables, Ladders &amp; Chairs replacing Armageddon in 2009.

==History==
From May 1995 to February 1999, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) held a series of monthly pay-per-views (PPV) titled In Your House. The WWF discontinued the In Your House series to establish permanent names for the monthly PPVs that would be held annually. Armageddon was established that year to be held as the annual December PPV. The inaugural Armageddon was held on December 12, 1999, at the National Car Rental Center in Sunrise, Florida and it aired live on PPV. The first two Armageddon events were held when the promotion was still called the WWF. In 2001, Armageddon was replaced by Vengeance due to the September 11 attacks; the promotion felt that the name &quot;Armageddon&quot; would offend victims of the attacks. Armageddon, however, was reinstated in 2002 with Vengeance moving up to July.

In 2002, the WWF changed its name to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) due to a court order following a lawsuit from the World Wildlife Fund over the &quot;WWF&quot; initialism. The promotion also held their very first draft that year to split its roster into two distinctive brands of wrestling, Raw and SmackDown!, where wrestlers would exclusively perform—ECW was added as a third brand in 2006. The 2002 event featured wrestlers from both Raw and SmackDown!, but the 2003 event was held exclusively for the Raw brand. It was then held exclusively for the SmackDown! brand from 2004 to 2006. Following WrestleMania 23 in 2007, WWE discontinued brand-exclusive PPVs. The 2007 event was the last pay-per-view to be broadcast by WWE in 480p standard definition format. In January 2008, all WWE programming switched to 720p high definition. The 2008 event was the final event as Armageddon was discontinued and replaced by TLC: Tables, Ladders &amp; Chairs in 2009.

<doc id="663188" wikidata="Q4744200" url="?curid=663188" title="American Invitational Mathematics Examination">
<text>The American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) is a selective 15-question, 3-hour test given since 1983 to those who rank in the top 5% on the AMC 12 high school mathematics examination (formerly known as the AHSME), and starting in 2010, those who rank in the top 2.5% on the AMC 10. Two different versions of the test are administered, the AIME I and AIME II. However, qualifying students can only take one of these two competitions.

The AIME is the second of two tests used to determine qualification for the United States Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO), the first being the AMC.

The use of calculators is not allowed on the test, with only pencils, erasers, rulers, and compasses permitted.

==Format and scoring==

The competition consists of 15 questions of increasing difficulty, where each answer is an integer between 000 and 999 inclusive. Thus the competition effectively removes the element of chance afforded by a multiple-choice test while preserving the ease of automated grading; answers are entered onto an OMR sheet, similar to the way grid-in math questions are answered on the SAT. Leading zeros must be filled in on the OMR sheet; for example, answers of 7 and 43 must be recorded as 007 and 043.

Concepts typically covered in the competition include topics in elementary algebra, geometry, trigonometry, as well as number theory, probability, and combinatorics. Many of these concepts are not directly covered in typical high school mathematics courses; thus, participants often turn to supplementary resources to prepare for the competition.

One point is earned for each correct answer, and no points are deducted for incorrect answers. No partial credit is given, so AIME scores are integers from 0 to 15 inclusive.

Some historical results are:

A student&#x27;s score on the AIME is used in combination with their score on the AMC to determine eligibility for the USAMO or USAJMO. A student&#x27;s AMC score is added to 10 times their AIME score to compute the USAMO or USAJMO index.

Since 2017, the USAMO and USAJMO qualification cutoff has been split between the AMC A and B, as well as the AIME I and II. Hence, there will be a total of 8 published USAMO and USAJMO qualification cutoffs per year, and a student can have up to 2 USAMO/USAJMO indices (via participating in both AMC contests). The student only needs to reach one qualification cutoff to take the USAMO or USAJMO. 

During the 1990s, fewer than 2,000 students typically qualified for the AIME. However, in 1994, an unprecedented 99 students achieved perfect scores on the AHSME, causing delays in result distribution. The usual pamphlets were replaced by thick newspaper bundles.

==History==

The AIME began in 1983. It was given once per year on a Tuesday or Thursday in late March or early April. Beginning in 2000, the AIME is administered twice per year. The second date serves as an alternate test for students who miss the first due to conflicts such as spring break or illness. However, under no circumstances may a student officially participate both competitions. The alternate competition, commonly called the &quot;AIME 2&quot; or &quot;AIME II,&quot; is usually given exactly two weeks after the first test, on a Tuesday in early April. However, like the AMC, the AIME recently has been given on a Tuesday in early March, and on the Wednesday 8 days later, e.g. March 13 and 21, 2019. In 2020, the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic led to the cancellation of the AIME II for that year. Instead, qualifying students were able to take the American Online Invitational Mathematics Examination, which contained the problems that were originally going to be on the AIME II. 2021&#x27;s AIME I and II were also moved online., 2022&#x27;s AIME I and II were administered both online and in-person, and starting from 2023, all AIME contests must be administered in-person. 

==Sample problems==

where formula_1 and formula_2 are positive integers and formula_2 is as large as possible, find formula_4 (&quot;2003 AIME I #1&quot;)
:&quot;Answer: 839&quot;

*Find the number of ordered pairs of integers formula_5 such that the sequence

is strictly increasing and no set of four (not necessarily consecutive) terms forms an arithmetic progression. (&quot;2022 AIME I #6&quot;)
:&quot;Answer: 228&quot;

*If the integer formula_1 is added to each of the numbers formula_7, formula_8, and formula_9, one obtains the squares of three consecutive terms of an arithmetic series. Find formula_1. (&quot;1989 AIME #7&quot;)
:&quot;Answer: 925&quot;

*Complex numbers formula_11, formula_12 and formula_13 are the zeros of a polynomial formula_14, and formula_15. The points corresponding to formula_11, formula_12, and formula_13 in the complex plane are the vertices of a right triangle with hypotenuse formula_19. Find formula_20. (&quot;2012 AIME I #14&quot;)

<doc id="663189" wikidata="Q470005" url="?curid=663189" title="Joe Manganiello">
<text>Joseph Michael Manganiello ( ; , ; born December 28, 1976) is an American actor. His professional film career began when he played Flash Thompson in Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot;. His breakout role was as werewolf Alcide Herveaux in five seasons of the HBO series &quot;True Blood&quot;.

He is also known for his roles in films such as &quot;Magic Mike,&quot; &quot;Magic Mike XXL,&quot; &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Holiday,&quot; &quot;What to Expect When You&#x27;re Expecting&quot;, &quot;Sabotage&quot;, and &quot;Rampage&quot;. In late 2013, he became a published author when his first book, &quot;Evolution&quot;, was released by Simon &amp; Schuster&#x27;s Gallery Books. His directorial debut came in 2014 with the documentary feature &quot;La Bare&quot;, which he also produced and financed. He is also known for his role as Brad Morris in &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;. He is active with several charities, primarily UPMC Children&#x27;s Hospital of Pittsburgh for which he serves on the board of trustees. In 2016, he was cast as Slade Wilson / Deathstroke in the DC Extended Universe, making his first appearance in 2017&#x27;s &quot;Justice League&quot;.

==Early life==
Manganiello was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Susan and Charles Manganiello. His mother is of Croatian, German, and Armenian descent. Manganiello&#x27;s father was born in Massachusetts outside of Boston. Joe Manganiello was raised in Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania.

In the February 7, 2023, episode of PBS series &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot;, the researchers uncovered that Manganiello&#x27;s legal paternal grandfather, Emilio Manganiello, was not his biological grandfather, and that his biological great-grandparents were an African-American man named William Henry Cutler and a white woman named Nellie Alton. His biological paternal grandfather was one of Cutler and Alton&#x27;s three mixed-race African-American sons. Using this information, researchers traced Manganiello&#x27;s paternal lineage back to his great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, Plato Turner, an African slave who was freed before slavery was abolished in Massachusetts and who went on to fight for the Continental Army during the American Revolution. Manganiello&#x27;s maternal great-grandmother, Terviz &quot;Rose&quot; Darakjian, was a survivor of the Armenian genocide, where her husband and seven of her children were killed. Darakjian&#x27;s eighth child, an infant, drowned during Darakjian&#x27;s escape across the Euphrates River. Darakjian later encountered Karl Wilhelm Beutinger, a German soldier, in an internment camp for survivors. Rose became pregnant by him. Beutinger soon left to return to Germany. He resumed his life there with his German wife and children, and never saw Rose Darakjian again. Manganiello&#x27;s grandmother is the child of Beutinger and Rose Darakjian.

He has a younger brother, Nicholas. Raised Catholic, was a student at St. Bernard School, a Catholic elementary school in Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania and then attended Mt. Lebanon High School, where he graduated with honors in 1995 and won the school&#x27;s Great Alumni Award in 2011. Growing up, he was the captain of his football, basketball, and volleyball teams and went on to play at the varsity level in all three sports. He won the role of Jud Fry in his school&#x27;s senior year production of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; and was involved with the school&#x27;s TV studio. He would borrow equipment in order to write and direct films with his friends, which eventually inspired him to begin studying acting.

Manganiello suffered a series of sports injuries through High School, including a torn medial collateral ligament while returning a kickoff in a varsity football game against Ringgold High School. The time off allowed Manganiello to reevaluate his future and so he decided to audition for the Carnegie Mellon School of Drama during his senior year. He was not accepted, so he enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh and worked over the next year in the theater. He then reapplied to Carnegie Mellon a year later, and was awarded a scholarship, accepted into the acting program that year. There he performed in theater productions and wrote, produced, and acted in a student film entitled &quot;Out of Courage 2: Out for Vengeance&quot;. He graduated in 2000 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in acting. He then traveled to New York City and Los Angeles through his university to participate in group auditions, which provided him contacts in the entertainment business including an agent, a manager, and a screen test for Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot;.

==Career==
===Early career===

While a student at Carnegie Mellon University, Manganiello appeared in numerous productions in Pittsburgh&#x27;s theatre scene, including Ulfheim in Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;When We Dead Awaken&quot;, Lorenzo in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; for Quantum Theatre, and Joe in the Pittsburgh premiere of &quot;The Last Night of Ballyhoo&quot;. He moved to Los Angeles, California, after graduating from Carnegie Mellon. He quickly signed with a talent agent, and three days later, he auditioned for the role of Peter Parker in the Sam Raimi-directed film &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2002). He landed the role of Eugene &quot;Flash&quot; Thompson, Peter Parker&#x27;s nemesis in high school, as his first acting job out of college. He reprised the role several years later, making a brief cameo in &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; (2007).

Manganiello began finding work in television, playing Tori Spelling&#x27;s boyfriend on VH1&#x27;s &quot;So Notorious&quot; in 2006, and guest starred on &quot;Las Vegas&quot;, &quot;Jake in Progress&quot;, and &quot;Close to Home&quot;. That year, he also played John Leguizamo&#x27;s Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor in the CBS television pilot &quot;Edison&quot;. In 2007, he appeared in the &quot;Scrubs&quot; episode &quot;My No Good Reason&quot; and in the MyNetwork TV nighttime soap opera &quot;American Heiress&quot;. He also played Officer Litchman, the love interest to Linda Cardellini&#x27;s character, for a four-episode arc on NBC&#x27;s &quot;ER&quot;. He returned to the stage playing &quot;The Chick Magnet&quot; in May 2007 for the New York City premiere of &quot;Skirts &amp; Flirts&quot;, a monologue show by Gloria Calderon Kellett, for which he was a finalist for HBO&#x27;s Aspen Comedy Festival. He then played Stanley Kowalski in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; for the West Virginia Public Theatre in 2008, directed by his former Carnegie Mellon professor Geoffrey Hitch.

He starred as Leo Belraggio, a New York jazz musician, in the West Coast premiere of Terrence McNally&#x27;s &quot;Unusual Acts of Devotion&quot; in June 2009. The play was staged at the La Jolla Playhouse at the University of California, San Diego. The summer prior, Manganiello worked alongside McNally and director Leonard Foglia to create the role at the Ojai Playwrights Conference. He played the lawyer Brad Morris on several seasons of the CBS comedy &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;. In 2008, he joined the cast of The CW drama &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; for its fifth season, playing bartender Owen Morello. He shot the series in Wilmington, North Carolina, and returned for its sixth and seventh seasons.

Manganiello played Stu on the Fox sitcom &quot;&#x27;Til Death&quot; for two episodes, and starred in the short film &quot;Wounded&quot; that year, which he originated on the stage and won Best Short Film at the 2011 Big Island Film Festival. He starred in the direct-to-video war film &quot;Behind Enemy Lines: Colombia&quot; in 2009 playing Lt. Sean Macklin, a Navy SEAL squad leader. In order to add authenticity to the production, he trained for several months with a former Navy SEAL, for whom he paid to come to the set and stay in the cast&#x27;s hotel. The film was shot in Puerto Rico. He appeared in an episode of &quot;Medium&quot; in 2009, and has guest starred on all three series of CBS&#x27;s &quot;CSI&quot; television franchise (&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;). He had a role in the independent film &quot;Irene in Time&quot;. In 2010, he appeared in television commercials for Taco Bell, promoting its new product. He shot television pilots for &quot;100 Questions&quot; and the Pittsburgh-set sitcom &quot;Livin&#x27; on a Prayer&quot;.

===&quot;True Blood&quot;===
In late 2009, Manganiello was cast as werewolf Alcide Herveaux in the third season of HBO&#x27;s &quot;True Blood&quot;. His work on the show over the next five years would bring him both popular and critical recognition, including being voted The Favorite Pop-Culture Werewolf of All-Time by the readers of Entertainment Weekly Magazine, the 2011 Scream Award for Breakout Performance – Male, as well as a shared award for Best Ensemble, a Saturn Award for Best Guest Starring Role in Television and a NewNowNext Award. &quot;True Blood&quot; was his favorite television show before he joined the cast. He was originally brought in by casting for the role of Coot, another werewolf in the series, but was asked by the producers to read for Alcide instead. He familiarized himself with the novels while growing out his hair and beard. He also trained twice a day for months to add muscle to match the description of the character in the books. Manganiello also got a suntan to set himself apart from the vampires on the series and spent time studying live wolves.

In early 2011, Manganiello was asked to screen test for the title role of Superman in &quot;Man of Steel&quot;, for which he was rumored to be the front runner, but due to scheduling problems with &quot;True Blood&quot;, he was forced to drop out during the final stage. He told &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; in an interview: &quot;They wanted me to screen test and they actually asked for my measurements for the suit and everything... their shoot date switched and it would have taken up 11 weeks out of my &quot;True Blood&quot; schedule. At the end of the day, we couldn&#x27;t get the schedule to work... so, regrettably, I never got to screen test, I never got to put the suit on.&quot;

Upon completion of filming for season four of &quot;True Blood&quot;, he shot an episode of USA&#x27;s &quot;White Collar&quot; with his former drama school classmate Matt Bomer, and then shot the film adaptation of the best-selling book &quot;What to Expect When You&#x27;re Expecting&quot; before returning to Los Angeles to shoot an episode of &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; with Ashton Kutcher.

===&quot;Magic Mike&quot; and other projects===
Manganiello was cast as Big Dick Richie in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s &quot;Magic Mike&quot;, the story of a male stripper in Tampa, Florida, played by actor Channing Tatum. &quot;Magic Mike&quot; would go on to become a cultural and box office phenomenon spawning its 2015 sequel &quot;Magic Mike XXL&quot;.

In between &quot;Magic Mike&quot; films and finishing out his last two seasons of &quot;True Blood&quot;, Manganiello branched out in a multitude of different ways. He shot David Ayer&#x27;s &quot;Sabotage&quot; with his childhood idol Arnold Schwarzenegger, who would go on to become a friend and mentor to Manganiello, penning the foreword to his book &quot;Evolution&quot; which was released through Simon &amp; Schuster&#x27;s Gallery Books in the fall of 2013. That autumn also saw Manganiello&#x27;s return to the stage once again as Stanley Kowalski in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; but this time for the prestigious Yale Repertory Theater in New Haven, Connecticut.

A few months later, Manganiello would take his documentary film &quot;La Bare&quot;, which he financed, directed, and produced under his new production company banner 3:59 with his brother Nick, to Park City, Utah, for the Slamdance Film Festival. He received multiple offers from distributors in the lobby after the first screening and within 24 hours sold the International and Domestic rights, including sales to Showtime and Netflix. Manganiello was given the Triple Threat Award from the Maui International Film Festival later that year for his work on the film.

===After &quot;True Blood&quot;===
In August 2016, test footage of Slade Wilson/Deathstroke was posted to Twitter by writer/director Ben Affleck. A few weeks later, Geoff Johns, DC Comics&#x27; then President and CCO, who was tasked to co-write/co-produce the solo Batman film with Affleck, confirmed that Deathstroke would appear in the shared film universe, with Manganiello portraying the character. In 2019, he was confirmed to appear in the Ben Affleck Batman film. However, Affleck was asked to step down from the film and Manganiello&#x27;s future as the character has remained uncertain ever since.

In 2017, Manganiello won an Emmy as the narrator of the documentary &quot;Pittsburgh is Home: The Story of the Penguins&quot;, which documented the first 50 years of history of the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey team.

=== &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; / Fantasy ===
Over the years, Manganiello has worked extensively with &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; as a writer, official ambassador, and paid consultant. His characters, including Arkhan the Cruel, are a part of Dungeons &amp; Dragons canon, appearing in adventure modules, video games, and in toy stores. He has appeared in episodes of &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, &quot;Nerd Poker&quot;, &quot;CelebriD&amp;D&quot;, &quot;Critical Role&quot; and the web series &quot;Force Grey&quot; playing the game. In 2017, Manganiello and John Cassel wrote a spec-script for a film adaptation of the first &quot;Dragonlance&quot; novel for Warner Brothers. In 2018, he launched the company Death Saves which produces fantasy/heavy-metal themed streetwear as well as a range of high end jewelry, clothing and gaming accessories. Over the years, the company has created officially licensed products for the television series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; and &quot;The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance&quot;, the indie horror film &quot;Mandy&quot;, &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, and at one point had full reign over the catalog of the late fantasy painter, Frank Frazetta.

He worked as a game designer for Hasbro&#x27;s remake of the adventure board game Hero Quest to write a quest book as a stretch goal in 2020. Although the stretch goal was not reached, he later announced he worked with Hasbro to have the quest book and additional game pieces included anyway.

In October 2022, Hasbro&#x27;s eOne announced that Manganiello had been tapped to direct and produce the first, official documentary about the history of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons,&quot; along with co-director Kyle Newman and his brother and producing partner Nick under their 3:59 banner, to be timed to release during the 50th anniversary of the game in 2024.

==Personal life==
Manganiello is a lifelong fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers. He directed and produced the 2007 short documentary &quot;DieHardz&quot; about Steelers fans who meet up at bars in Los Angeles, California. He is also a Pittsburgh Penguins fan and hosted the 2017 NHL Awards and the 2017 NHL Expansion Draft.

On a trip to Sydney, Australia, he attended a Wests Tigers rugby league match.

He was once a roadie for the band Goldfinger and is friends with lead singer John Feldmann; he toured internationally with the group as a member of their security.

He became engaged to actress Sofía Vergara on Christmas Eve 2014 after six months of dating. They married in Palm Beach, Florida, on November 22, 2015. On July 17, 2023, Manganiello and Vergara announced to &quot;Page Six&quot; that they had separated and were planning to divorce after seven years of marriage. The divorce was finalized in February 2024. Since September 2023, he has been in a relationship with Caitlin O&#x27;Connor.

He is a longtime practitioner of Transcendental Meditation and learned at the David Lynch Foundation center in Los Angeles.

In October 2022, he was granted Italian citizenship through his paternal grandmother&#x27;s Sicilian ancestry.

<doc id="663191" wikidata="Q7059349" url="?curid=663191" title="Northfield, Birmingham">
<text>Northfield is a residential area in outer south Birmingham, in the county of the West Midlands, England, near the boundary with Worcestershire, which it was historically within. It is also a council constituency, managed by its own district committee. The constituency includes the wards of Kings Norton, Longbridge, Weoley Castle and the smaller ward of Northfield that includes West Heath and Turves Green.

Mentioned in the Domesday Book and formerly a small village, then included in north Worcestershire, Northfield became part of Birmingham in 1911 after it had been rapidly expanded and developed in the period prior to World War I. The northern reaches of Northfield fall within the Bournville model village and the southern housing estates were originally built by Austin Motors for their workforce.

A centre of the Midlands nail making industry during the 19th century and home to both the Kalamazoo paper factory and the Austin motor company&#x27;s Longbridge factory in the 20th century, today Northfield is predominantly a residential and dormitory suburb of metropolitan Birmingham. Northfield stands on either side of the main A38, heading south from the centre of Birmingham to Bromsgrove and onwards all the way to Cornwall.

==History==
===Pre-history===
Northfield was occupied or visited in the Stone Age as evidenced by a yellow Chert neolithic scraper discovered in Quarry Lane and a stone axe-head found on Tessall Lane, dated to the New Stone Age. It is also possible that Northfield was occupied in the Bronze Age as large burnt mounds of heat-shattered stones have been identified alongside Northfield&#x27;s streams evidencing occupation of the area over a lengthy period of time. One of these mounds found near Merritts Brook Lane is 16 metres across. Two further mounds, one on Griffin&#x27;s Brook near Woodlands Park Road and another at the foot of Bell Hill, were radiocarbon-dated to c1070 BCE and c1120 BCE respectively. The usage evidence is not totally conclusive, but the hot stones are believed to have either provided heating for domestic cooking or Bronze Age saunas.

===Roman, Saxon and Norman periods===
Before Roman times the area round Northfield most likely belonged to the Celtic tribe, Dobunii, there is little evidence of Saxon settlement and the area was probably mainly Celtic.
The name was original &quot;nord feld&quot;, an Anglo-Saxon phrase and Northfield was probably named because the area is to the north of Bromsgrove. Northfield was also near the northern edge of the Saxon kingdom called Hwicce as were Kings Norton and Yardley and was near the northern edge of the area settled by Saxons arriving from the south.

What is now the route of the Bristol Road South through Northfield had become known as the Upper Saltway (part of the historic Ryknild Street), because it was one of the routes used to transport salt extracted from the Droitwich brine springs all the way to Saltfleet on the Lincolnshire coast. The salt was then loaded onto ships and exported to France and Scandinavia for trading purposes.

The Romans also used the road that became the Upper Saltway as a frequent route between settlements and marching forts. Roman occupation evidence was discovered by chance near the Bristol Road South in Northfield when Pigeon House near Hill Top Road was demolished in c1921 (as the Bristol Road was being widened) and the &quot;Northfield hoard&quot; of 16 Roman coins was found buried. The trove included coins of Claudius II Gothicus (268–270 CE), Diocletian (284–305 CE), Maximian (285–286 CE), Constantius (305–306 CE), Constantine (306–337 CE) . The excavation also revealed a Roman aqueduct that indicated a Romano-British building of some status had once stood on the site. In 1963 a Roman coin was found in nearby Rednal by a Janet and Stephen Harris. The coin was a dupondius struck during the reign of the Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius who ruled Rome and Britain from 138 to 161 AD. The tiny coin was struck from brass and would have been worth about the price of a loaf of bread.

Northfield was in a Saxon settlement or a Celtic area that Saxons had conquered in North Worcestershire, which in 1086 became part of the lands of William Fitz-Ansculf, a Norman knight. The village Nordfeld is described in the Domesday Book as having a priest as well as seven villeins, sixteen bordars, six cottars, who shared enough land for thirteen ploughs, two serfs and a bondswoman (a slave). St. Laurence&#x27;s Church, Northfield dates from the 12th century, nearby is the Great Stone Inn with a medieval timber framed hall and the 17th Century village pound where stray animals were kept; the large rock in the pound, a glacial &quot;erratic&quot; (see Geology below), was formerly in the road at the corner of the inn, and was used as a mounting-block by horse-riders; it was removed in the interests of road safety in the 1950s. The area round the church, the inn and the pound are a conservation area because of their historic importance. A local joke describes Northfield as &quot;where they sell beer by the Stone and ale by the Pound&quot;.

===Civil War period===
During the English Civil War Northfield stood on the northern border of royalist Worcestershire and right next to parliamentary Warwickshire and there were regular minor skirmishes and conflicts between the forces of the two opposing sides. Hawkesley House in West Heath, which belonged to the royalist Middlemore family, was besieged and seized by parliamentary forces who fortified the building but were re-expelled subsequently by royalist forces in May 1645 and the house was then razed to the ground. Prince Rupert of the Rhine, commander of the Royalist cavalry, lived in Longbridge House and used it as his headquarters throughout the siege of Hawkesley House. Hawksley House is now an archaeological site.

There are traditions that Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond, slept in Selly Manor on his way to the Battle of Bosworth Field. Later Robert Catesby, of the Gunpowder plot fame, and Oliver Cromwell are both said to have also visited Northfield and also stayed at Selly Manor House.

===19th century===

Throughout the early part of the 19th century Northfield was known for its nail making industry based in cottages and small workshops next to the Church. Within the ward in 1831 there were 122 men recorded as being employed in the industry. However the industry was already in decline – in 1841 there were 74 nailers and in 1884 there were only 23 with seven of those in West Heath. Nailer&#x27;s workshops had been present in Northfield, Groveley, West Heath and Turves Green. By the start of the 20th century nailing had moved to central Birmingham factories, ceasing to be a cottage industry. Also nearby were a number of grain mills on the banks of the River Rea, where locally grown corn and wheat was ground.

Northfield was on the main road between Birmingham and Worcester. In 1762 this route was turnpiked and the Northfield tollgate was on the site of the modern-day corner of Rochester Road. Today the original turnpike is known as the Bristol Road South. The &#x27;Bell and Bluebell Inn&#x27; at the junction of Bell Lane and Bell Holloway was a coaching station for travellers until a new &#x27;Bell Inn&#x27; was built on the Bristol Road in 1803. There was a small separate hamlet on Bell Lane where several late 18th-century and early 19th-century cottages still survive. From 1766 a cross-country route was also turnpiked from Northfield to Wootton Wawen, Henley-in-Arden.

In 1868 N E S A Hamilton&#x27;s The National Gazetteer of Great Britain and Ireland described the parish as follows:

:&quot;Northfield, a parish in the upper division of the hundred of Halfshire, county Worcester, 6 miles South-West. of Birmingham, its post town, and 2 West of the King&#x27;s Norton station on the Gloucester railway. It is situated on the small river Rea, and on the road from Birmingham to Worcester.&quot;
:&quot;The parish contains the hamlets of Selly, Hay, Shendley, and Bartley. A portion of the inhabitants are employed in nail making. There are chemical works and freestone quarries. The surface is flat towards the East, but hilly in the West. The soil is a fertile loam, producing good crops of wheat and beans.&quot;

In 1870 Northfield railway station was opened providing new business opportunities. Charles Pegram, a local industrialist built houses for railway workers, also a roller skating rink and a temperance hotel all near the station.

===20th century===
Victoria Common was laid out and landscaped on the site of the former public common land called Bradley&#x27;s Field by Birmingham City Council as a municipal recreation area to mark Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee in 1897, was never completed and reopened to the public until 1901. The park has changed little since it was first opened (though trees have grown and matured), excepting the additions of several tennis courts laid in the 1930s and a children&#x27;s play area built in the 1950s and renewed since. A tributary of Griffin&#x27;s Brook ran through the park but was piped underground as far as St Lawrence Road during landscaping. The original grand entrance gates, park-keeper&#x27;s residential lodge, gardeners&#x27; workshops and nursery greenhouse all stood on the Bristol Road South where the Northfield Shopping Centre precinct now stands.

During the first decade of the 20th century Austin Motor Works and Kalamazoo both entered the area, providing plentiful and well paid employment for Northfield residents.

In 1900 visitors arriving via Northfield railway station could visit the skating rink on West Heath Road next to the bridge over the River Rea. Unfortunately the skating rink was used during the First World War as a munitions factory and following an accident the rink was destroyed by fire. Another notable building of the area was &quot;The Bath Tub&quot; open air lido (now demolished), opened on 1 July 1937 in Alvechurch Road, where 20,000 people had gathered to watch the opening ceremony by Gracie Fields with Mantovani and his orchestra and the M.P. for Northfield and Kings Norton, Ronald Cartland, the brother of Dame Barbara Cartland, the novelist. The lido which had been built by Percy Hollier, who intended it to be &quot;Birmingham&#x27;s brightest entertainment spot&quot; and which included a 180-foot-by-90-foot swimming pool as well as a putting green, lawn for archery and a children&#x27;s playground, only operated for three years and was closed due to commercial failure. Laughtons took over the site with Eddystone Radio during World War II, when its semi-rural location helped it to avoid attack by German air raids. The lido site is now covered by a housing estate.

Northfield Library serves the area. It was opened in 1906, but was destroyed by fire in 1914 in a suspected arson attack by the Suffragettes. It was rebuilt in the same year by the Free Libraries Committee. The façade remains the same; however, in 1984, the library building was doubled in size to accommodate more books. The library celebrated its centenary in 2006. West Heath library also serves the area.

As recently as 1900 Northfield was still a village within the rural north Worcestershire countryside. The residential Austin Village was built during World War I to house factory workers. Later a succession of private and council housing developments had completely swallowed Northfield up into the City of Birmingham. The extensive housebuilding continued before and after World War II through extensions to the Bournville Model Village and several estates of temporary Prefab housing in West Heath, although new house provision has slowed down to a much less dramatic rate since the 1970s. 

In 1911 the civil parish had a population of 31,395. On 9 November 1912 the parish was abolished and merged with Birmingham.

By 1900 a large mansion on the Bristol Road South near St Lawrence Road called Gainsborough House, originally built in the 17th century, was renamed The Priory and became home to the Convent of our Lady of Charity housing up to twenty nuns and girls. The grounds of the Priory nearly reached Heath Road South and included a circuitous woodland walk and a large lake. Demolished in the 1990s the Priory and its grounds are now covered by a modern housing estate and an extension to the Royal Orthopedic Hospital.
Birmingham Corporation Tramways operated a network of electric trams in Birmingham between 1904 until 1953. It was the largest narrow-gauge tramway network in the UK, built to a gauge of 3 ft 6 inches and the fourth largest tramway network in the UK after London, Glasgow and Manchester. The tram-tracks ran in both directions along the central grassed reservation of the Bristol Road South but also ran right through the centre of Northfield, with cars and commercial vehicles having to give way to the trams on the rails set into the road. Both routes that ran through Northfield, Route 70 (Navigation Street to Rednal) and Route 71 (Navigation Street to Rubery) were closed down on 5 July 1952. Eventually, over a number of years, the rails were covered by tarmac during several road -repair schemes during the 1950s and 1960s.

A major housing development in Northfield was the Egghill Estate in the west of the district. It was built by the city council during the 1950s and 1960s, with hundreds of properties being built. There were several multi-storey blocks of flats as well as lower blocks of flats and a shopping centre among the concentration of low-rise housing. By the 1980s, however, the estate was plagued by crime and the declining quality of the housing stock. In 2000, the city council decided to demolish the entire estate to make way for a new housing development. A decade on, however, the redevelopment is far from complete. Some of the old houses remain, while only a small number of new housing association properties have been built, and the bulk of the estate remains derelict and undeveloped. When the redevelopment is finally completed, it is expected that the new Egghill Estate will include improved shopping and community facilities.

There are many pre-war and post war council houses, maisonettes, flats and tower blocks in Northfield Constituency.

==Geography==

===Geology===

Northfield is built on a well-drained stretch of gravel and sand that had been laid down under a prehistoric shallow sea and enriched by sediments from ice age glaciers. The natural heath land had grown on a flatter area between the nearby Lickey Hills and Redhill. The Northfield area includes a wide geological range of rocks of various ages. The stratigraphic sequence, which is the basis for the area&#x27;s diversity of landscape and habitat, comprises:

*Barnt Green rocks – Precambrian tuffs and volcanic grits
*Lickey Quartzite – a Cambrian quartzite
*Rubery sandstone – a fossiliferous sandstone of lower Silurian age
*Keele Clay – a Carboniferous clay
*Clent Breccia – a Permian breccia that consists of angular fragments mostly of volcanic rock embedded in a sandy matrix of the same general composition. Clent breccia is the most common sandstone under central Northfield.
*Bunter Pebble Beds – beds of Triassic water-worn pebbles
*Keuper marl – a late Triassic sandstone. Deep wells, sunk through the Keuper formation into the Bunter sandstones below were used to supply the whole of Birmingham with drinking water before the Elan Valley scheme was carried through. Examples of such wells occurred in Northfield, Selly Oak and at Longbridge.

Northfield stands on a small part of the &quot;Northfield—Dudley plateau&quot;, which constitutes part of the South Staffordshire Uplands and was covered by a massive glacier that stretched all the way from Wales during the last ice age approximately 10,000 – 13,000 years ago. The evidence for this lies in the occurrence of numerous Erratic boulders or far-travelled ice-borne stones, some of which are of immense size, as well as the vast deposits of glacial sands and gravels in the district. The composition of many of these boulders shows that they originated from as far away as Scotland or Snowdonia in Wales, such as the massive boulder discovered while Rowheath playing fields were laid out. Another large boulder is the one after which the Great Stone Inn is named. This glacial erratic from North Wales stood for ten thousand years at the corner of Church Hill and Church Road until it was moved several metres into the adjacent pound during the 1950s. Others indicate a more local origin, such as the Wrekin district in Shropshire. The subsoil layers under Northfield, West Heath and Turves Green also contains a coal seam that would indicate that an extensive prehistoric tropical forest once existed here.

===Waterways===

The River Rea runs through Northfield on its way from its source to the North Sea.
The river rises in Waseley Hills Country Park and after dropping in the first mile passes through Northfield, West Heath and onwards to Kings Norton, Selly Oak and Digbeth in the centre of Birmingham. Near Gravelly Hill Interchange, about from its source, the Rea becomes a tributary of the River Tame and its waters eventually discharge into the North Sea via later connections with the River Trent and eventually the Humber Estuary. Although now culverted for much of its route through Birmingham and often reduced to a sluggish trickle, due to changes in agricultural usage and other demands, the River Rea was once a major waterway and served several working mills in West Heath and provided water for the skating rink and open air lido (now both demolished).

A tributary of Griffin&#x27;s Brook flows through Northfield&#x27;s Victoria Common and parallel to Heath Road South on its way to Bournville although it is piped underground now for most of its route since the 1970s, surfacing only briefly to feed the pond near Hole Farm Road, then in Woodlands Park and next near the Valley Pool boating lake, after which it joins up with Griffin&#x27;s Brook proper which is then renamed the Bourn Brook until it flows into the River Rea. In the 18th century Griffin&#x27;s Brook was prone to flooding and in the summer of 1786 was reported as being &quot;eight times swollen to such a degree as to interrupt or greatly incommode carriages and passengers on the Bristol Road.&quot;

Merritt&#x27;s Brook rises as springs in fields to the south-west of Northfield, crossing Bell Holloway and flowing parallel to the Bristol Road South until it flows into the lake at Manor Farm. From there the brook flows into Griffin&#x27;s Brook just west of the A38 near Griffin&#x27;s Brook Lane.

===Roads===
The A38 Bristol Road South, which runs between Birmingham and Worcester and eventually Cornwall, passes to the west. The M42 and M5 Motorways are also close, providing national connections.

==Industry==

Northfield is perhaps most famous for the Longbridge plant, the Austin Rover car factory located in the Longbridge Ward. This factory was built in 1905 making Austin cars, and gradually expanded over the next 70 years to build higher volumes of vehicles by successive carmaking combines including BMC, British Leyland, Austin Rover, Rover Group and most recently MG Rover. In April 2005 MG Rover went into administration with the loss of more than 6,500 jobs. The company assets were bought by Chinese carmaker Nanjing Automobile three months later, and low volume production began in May 2007 with just over 200 workers employed at the factory making MG TF sports cars. However, the majority of the factory site was demolished, with plans to regenerate the area with a new town centre for Longbridge, new shops, parks and homes, which it is claimed will help with the unemployment suffered by the former workers of the Rover factory. Other developments are a park and ride for the station, with some buildings owned by Network West Midlands demolished to make way for it.

In 1913 Oliver Morland and local Quaker businessman F Paul Impey moved their Kalamazoo paper factory from central Birmingham to an extensive site near the Bristol Road South between Northfield and Longbridge. The factory developed as a major supplier of business stationery and computer multi-part forms, employing predominantly female factory workers, until it closed in the 1980s. Kalamazoo moved into the IT industry, specialising in ERP systems for automotive dealerships, with their headquarters located nearby. In 2001 an American firm, UCS acquired Kalamazoo Computer Group PLC and the business was re-branded as Kalamazoo Ltd until 2003 where it was renamed Kalamazoo-UCS Ltd. After the 2006 UCS merger of Reynolds and Reynolds, the UK company was renamed Kalamazoo-Reynolds Ltd. In November 2012 Kalamazoo-Reynolds rebranded to Reynolds and Reynolds Ltd. Reynolds and Reynolds UK still operate at the site in Northfield today.

==Demography==
The 2001 Population Census recorded that 23,042 people were living in the ward with a population density of 4,417 people per km2 compared with 3,649 people per km2 for Birmingham. The percentage of the population represented by ethnic minorities is low in comparison to other wards with a figure of 4.9% (1,130) as opposed to 29.6% for Birmingham in general.

The 2021 Population Census recorded that 10,404 people were living in the ward with a population density of 4,470 people per km2. The percentage of the population represented by ethnic minorities is low in comparison to other wards with a figure of 16.4% (1,711) as opposed to 51.3% for Birmingham in general. The largest religious group was Christianity at 56.5% (5,549).

==Education==

==Local services==

===Hospitals===

Northfield is served by the NHS Trust Selly Oak Hospital, now part of the University Hospital Trust and due to close shortly to move into new premises, occupies the premises of the former Kings Norton Union Workhouse although the infirmary buildings have not been used as wards for many years, but as offices and consulting rooms. Currently, part of the hospital is used as the main treatment centre for military casualties from Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as hosting the main prosthetic limb production and fitment centre in the West Midlands.
The specialist Royal Orthopaedic Hospital stands on the Bristol Road South, George Cadbury bought the Woodlands, as it was originally called, and gave it to the Crippled Children&#x27;s Union in 1909 to be used as a hospital. 
A new £8 million out-patients department was opened in May 2011. The addition contains 24 consultation rooms, treatment rooms and other facilities replaced the temporary out-patients buildings that had been used since 1992.

Hollymoor Hospital, a psychiatric facility on Tessal Lane in Northfield, was built as an annexe to Rubery Lunatic Asylum by the Birmingham Corporation, opening in 1905. Hollymoor Hospital served as Northfield Military Hospital in the Second World War: it closed in 1995 and has largely been demolished.

===Retail===

The former Grosvenor shopping centre, has been renamed &#x27;Northfield Shopping Centre&#x27; and contains several leading retail stores including Wilko, Iceland, WH Smiths, Greggs, New Look and Holland and Barrett. The shopping centre is also home to the Northfield Cobbler for shoe repairs and key cuttings. The shops in Northfield town centre run along what used to be the main A38 (Bristol Road South; the A38 proper now bypasses the town centre) and include Home Bargains, Aldi, B &amp; M (opened March 2011), plus a Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket on the junction with Frankley Beeches Road (previously based in the Grosvenor shopping centre). There is also a covered market in the Bristol Rd shopping area. This shopping area serves a large region and is used by residents outside Northfield ward itself.

In June 2010, Northfield Radio Link scheme was launched across the town centre to allow shops to quickly share information with each other, security and the police to make the town safer.

A traditional farmers&#x27; market is held on the second Saturday of the month from 9-1:30 at Kings Norton Green and a car boot sale is held most Saturdays during the year in a field on Merrits Brook Lane.

Northfield is centred on the main A38 road, which runs southwards from Birmingham and leads to Bromsgrove, Worcester, Gloucester, Bristol, Exeter and eventually Bodmin in Cornwall. The section of this road through Northfield was traditionally very congested around the old village centre, but in 2006 a relief road was built, which has significantly improved the situation. The relief road involved widening a part of an existing road Bell Lane, a new by pass was also built and named, &quot;Sir Herbert Austin Way&quot; in recognition of Herbert Austin, 1st Baron Austin who started producing cars at the Longbridge plant and built Austin Village in the Northfield part of Turves Green.
