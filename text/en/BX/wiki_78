<text>Rosarito is a coastal city in Playas de Rosarito Municipality, Baja California, on the Pacific Coast of Mexico. As of 2010, the city had a population of 65,278. Located south of the US–Mexico border, Rosarito is a part of the greater San Diego–Tijuana region and one of the westernmost cities in Mexico. Rosarito is a major tourist destination, known for its beaches, resorts, and events like Baja Beach Fest.

==History==

Evidence of the presence of Paleo-Indians in the region has been dated as early as 2,000 BC. By 1,000 BC, a group emerged that is recognizable as the Yuman ancestors of the Kumeyaay, who continued to inhabit the northern portion of the Baja California Peninsula at the time of European contact. The Kumeyaay referred to the area now known as Rosarito as &quot;Wa-cuatay&quot;, which translates to &quot;big houses&quot; in the Kumeyaay language.

===Spanish era===
After conquering the Aztec Empire, Hernán Cortés sent expeditions to explore what he believed to be the Island of California. In 1533, mutineer Fortún Ximénez was the first European to land in Baja California, at La Paz, Baja California Sur. In September 1542, Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo passed through the Rosarito area on his way from Ensenada to San Diego Bay. The year of 1697 saw the establishment of the first permanent European settlement in Baja California in a Jesuit mission at Loreto. Rosarito would soon be caught in a power struggle between Jesuits, Dominicans, and Franciscan friars for decades.

In 1773, a frontier was defined separating Nueva (&quot;new&quot;) or Alta (&quot;upper&quot;) California, under the jurisdiction of the Franciscans, from Antigua (&quot;old&quot;) or Baja (&quot;lower&quot;) California, which was entrusted to the Dominicans. In 1788, Luis de Sales, a Dominican priest, redrew the boundary, extending Baja California to the Rosarito Arroyo, known at the time as the Barrabas Arroyo.

Because Mission San Miguel, to the south, was frequently flooded by the Río Guadalupe, Dominican missionary Tomás de Ahumada sought another site on higher ground for at El Descanso. Additional advantages of the northerly location were good grazing and plentiful arable land. In 1817, Ahumada founded the Misión El Descanso or Misión San Miguel la Nueva among the Kumeyaay people to the south of the present-day Rosarito.

===Rancho era===
The property of Rancho El Rosario, granted by José María de Echeandía in 1827 to Don José Manuel Machado, one of the first soldiers stationed at the Presidio of San Diego, was the first ranch in the modern-day Rosarito region. The 11 league rancho was bounded on the north by Rancho Tía Juana, on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the south by public lands. 

In 1830, Father Félix Caballero constructed an adobe church here and managed both missions from El Descanso, but in 1834, it ceased to function as a mission. At the time it had a population of just 254, including those from Mission San Miguel. By 1853 the mission was deserted. Ruins of Misión El Descanso remain within the community of El Descanso.

José Manuel Machado&#x27;s son, Don Joaquín Machado, applied for title to the land as Rancho Rosarito to President Porfirio Díaz. On May 14, 1885, Machado received his title and registered it in Ensenada, then the capital city of the Northern District of Baja California Territory. May 14 is now recognized and celebrated as Rosarito&#x27;s Foundation Day by the Historical Society of Rosarito.

===Modern era===

On December 1, 1995, Rosarito was converted from a suburb of Tijuana to an independent city. Hugo Torres Chabert, current owner of the Rosarito Beach Hotel led the incorporation drive and was subsequently appointed to a three-year term as mayor.

Playas de Rosarito lies on the coast of the Pacific Ocean on the North Baja California Peninsula. The city is positioned between the foothills of the Peninsular Ranges and the ocean. It maintains a relatively uniform topography and displays few variances in terrain.

Urbanization in 1950 marked the beginning of Rosarito&#x27;s contemporary-era development as planning and construction of streets and city blocks took place. As land sales soared, coupled with the construction of small restaurants, some shops and two hotels, the city began to take shape its present-day appearance. In the 1960s, Playas de Rosarito entered the commercial and industrial era with the constructions of a large thermoelectric power plant and the later installations of Pemex, the state-owned petroleum company.

The city maintains luxury resorts that take the form of skyscrapers on its coast. The majority of these buildings are located on Boulevard Benito Juárez, also the city&#x27;s main Boulevard. Residential and commercial highrises continue to go up along the coast, towards both Tijuana and Ensenada.

==Geography==
===Climate===

Rosarito has a semi-arid climate with Mediterranean-like precipitation patterns (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSh/BSk&quot;). The climate is strongly influenced by the cold California Current and, as a result, temperatures are mild throughout the year with average temperatures ranging between .

The average annual precipitation is , most of it being concentrated in the winter months. The wettest month is March with while the driest month is July. It has cool winters with an average temperature of in February and March, and warm summers with an average temperature of in August.

On December 16, 2008, the city center was flooded by heavy rains.

==Culture==
Rosarito has historically been centered on tourism. It began with the Ortiz family&#x27;s establishment of Rene&#x27;s (Bar, Restaurant, Trailer Park and Motel) in 1925. Rene served his town holding the position Delegado (Mayor) more than any other politician in Rosarito. Rene, a prominent businessman, helped create Rosarito from a ranch to a town which later became a city. When Rene was not able to serve his people any longer he chose as his successor Hugo Torres Chabert, a friend and owner of Hotel Rosarito.
While Prohibition was the law of the land, many U.S. residents began to cross the border into Mexico, where drinking was still legal. Tijuana seemed to attract a more speakeasy-oriented clientele, and Rosarito became a haven for the more well-heeled and Hollywood set. Rosarito was visited by Hollywood film stars such as Orson Welles and Dolores del Río who were attracted by hunting (deer, quail and rabbit) and fishing (lobster, abalone). While Rita Hayworth was married to Prince Aly Khan, son of Aga Khan III, the two would visit the Rosarito Beach Hotel, take over an entire floor, and bring their own staff, including a personal chef. Other Hollywood visitors included Mickey Rooney, Ava Gardner, Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn.

A descendant of Maria Luisa Chabert Uriarte, the young wife of Manuel P. Barbachano the founder of Rosarito Beach Hotel, her nephew Hugo Torres Chabert led the drive to incorporate the city in 1995, and was appointed to a three-year term as Mayor. In 2007, Torres Chabert ran for election and was overwhelmingly elected to a new three-year term. The subject of rising crime rates and police corruption were major issues in the campaign. Torres Chabert, as owner of the Rosarito Beach Hotel, was deeply concerned about the safety of tourists, and pledged strong action to deal with both issues. In early 2008, both federal and state police were ordered into the city (along with neighboring Tijuana) to reinforce the city&#x27;s efforts.

Rosarito was the source of rocks for the Pet Rock collectible of the 1970s.

In September 1996, James Cameron&#x27;s production team moved to the newly built Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, where a full scale RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; had been constructed for the 1997 film, in which Fox acquired of waterfront south of Rosarito. Some scenes for the movie Deep Blue Sea were also filmed here too, in the same studio as Titanic.

==Transportation==
Mexican Federal Highway 1 and tollway 1D connect Rosarito with western and Downtown Tijuana to the north and Ensenada to the south. 

The Corredor Tijuana-Rosarito 2000 freeway connects Rosarito with the Mesa de Otay area of northeast Tijuana and the Otay Mesa Port of Entry to the United States.

==Education==
Rosarito hosts a branch of the Autonomous University of Baja California, offering bachelor&#x27;s degree in Administration and Public Accounting, Social Sciences and Humanities, Commerce and International Relations, Communication, Journalism, Education and Pedagogy, Engineering and Technology, Psychology, and Social Sciences of Behavior.

<doc id="682231" wikidata="Q5323412" url="?curid=682231" title="EMD FP45">
<text>The EMD FP45 is a cowl unit type of C-C diesel locomotive produced in the United States by General Motors Electro-Motive Division (EMD). It was produced beginning in 1967 at the request of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, which did not want its prestigious &quot;Super Chief/El Capitan&quot; and other passenger trains pulled by freight style hood unit locomotives, which have external walkways.

==History and development==
The EMD SDP45 performed well in passenger service, but the Santa Fe Railway felt its utilitarian appearance was unsuitable for its passenger trains. EMD therefore designed a lightweight &quot;cowl&quot; body to cover the locomotive, though it did not, as in earlier cab units, provide any structural strength, which remained in the frame. The cowl provided sleeker looks, better aerodynamics at speed, and allowed the crew to enter the engine compartment en route for diagnostics and maintenance. Final drive gear ratio for passenger service was 57:20.

==Orders==
Santa Fe purchased nine of the locomotives (road numbers 100 through 108), and the Milwaukee Road bought five for its passenger service (road numbers 1 through 5). The Milwaukee Road units were delivered without dynamic brakes. Reportedly, Illinois Central Railroad was considering an order for five FP45s as well (EMD order #5742, serial #s 34952–34956), but canceled it. Such low production was feasible and profitable for EMD since the locomotive was fundamentally just a re-clothed SDP45. Power, as in the SDP45, was from a V20 645E3 engine (or prime mover) developing .

==Derivatives==
A freight-only derivative, the EMD F45, was sold in greater numbers (86) to Santa Fe, the Great Northern Railway, and the Burlington Northern Railroad. Amtrak purchased a similar passenger locomotive based on the SD40-2, the SDP40F. After a series of derailments and their subsequent withdrawal, Amtrak traded 18 units to the Santa Fe, where they were converted for freight use. The converted locomotives were designated as SDF40-2.

The last three F45s in service were on the Montana Rail Link and the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway in the northern and northeastern United States. These units were taken out of service in 2006 for the MRL and 2010 for the NYSW. Three are known to survive, with one located at the Izaak Walton Inn, now converted into a lodge. 

==Rebuilds==
Between April 1980 and December 1982, Santa Fe&#x27;s San Bernardino shops rebuilt eight FP45s 5940–5943, 5945–5948. They emerged as 5990–5993, 5995–5998, and were redesignated SDFP45s. The 5944 was retired in September 1981 on account of a wreck at Toland, Texas. Electrically they were upgraded to SD45-2 standards. Mechanically, they were re-geared from 59:18 to 60:17, reducing their top speed from 89 to 83 mph (143 to 134 km/h).

In the mid-1980s Santa Fe again re-geared them - this time to 62:15 for 71 mph (114 km/h).

==Withdrawal==
Milwaukee Road&#x27;s FP45s were all sold for scrap in 1981 and 1984. Santa Fe SDFP45 No. 5944 was wrecked in 1981, Santa Fe SDFP45 No. 96 was wrecked in 1994 on Cajon Pass. While No. 91 was sold to the Wisconsin Central in January 1995, becoming their #6652 and the rest stayed in service right up until the BNSF merger in 1996, and were retired shortly after the merger.

== Preservation ==
Those that were not wrecked in service, or sold to other railroads, are on display in museums:
* Santa Fe 90: was donated to the Oklahoma Railway Museum in Oklahoma City in a non-operational state. #90 was the last FP45 donated by the Santa Fe and had resided on a RIP track for two years before being delivered to the museum.
* Santa Fe 92: was donated to the Illinois Railway Museum in Union, Illinois. In 2010, volunteers restored 92&#x27;s control stand so that it could control other locomotives via MU. The locomotive was moved to National Railway Equipment in Silvis, IL during July 2017, where a replacement 20-645E3 engine, AR10 alternator, and a WBO air compressor (all purchased by the museum) were installed. This made the locomotive fully operational for the first time since at least 1997.
* Santa Fe 93: preserved at the Great Plains Transportation Museum in Wichita, Kansas. It was delivered in June 1999 and has recently undergone cosmetic restoration. A further restoration is planned.
* Santa Fe 95: preserved at the Western America Railroad Museum in Barstow, California.
* Santa Fe 97: preserved at the Museum of the American Railroad in Frisco, Texas. Currently under restoration, will be renumbered back to Santa Fe 107.
* Santa Fe 108: was donated in operating condition minus the cab&#x27;s air conditioner to the Southern California Railway Museum at Perris, California. This locomotive has the distinction of being the last passenger locomotive ever purchased by Santa Fe. Its restoration was completed in October, 2018 and it is now in operating condition for the first time since 2012.

<text>Juan Alberto Melgar Castro (20 June 1930 – 2 December 1987) was an army officer in the Honduran military who served as the head of state of Honduras from 22 April 1975 to 7 August 1978, when he was removed from power by others in the military.

==Presidency==
General Melgar Castro took power in the 1975 Honduran coup d&#x27;état which removed Oswaldo López Arellano after his bribery scandal with United Fruit Company.

During his rule, the process of land reform was slowed down, because of pressure from land-owning sectors and influential politicians.

==Biography==
His wife Nora Gúnera de Melgar was Mayor of Tegucigalpa. She was the nominee of the National Party (&quot;Partido Nacional&quot;) for President of Honduras in 1997, but lost to the Liberal Party nominee, Carlos Roberto Flores.

General Melgar Castro died of a heart attack near San Pedro Sula on 2 December 1987 .

<text>Jaleel Ahmad White (born November 27, 1976) is an American actor. He is best known for his role as Steve Urkel on the sitcom &quot;Family Matters&quot; (1989–1998) where he was originally intended to make one appearance. White eventually became the main protagonist of the show. 

White was the first American actor to voice the Sega video game character Sonic the Hedgehog, doing so in the animated series &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; (also known as &quot;Sonic SatAM&quot;) and &quot;Sonic Underground&quot;. After &quot;Family Matters&quot; ended, White starred in the short-lived UPN comedy series &quot;Grown Ups&quot; (1999–2000) and appeared in supporting roles in the film &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; (2006) and on television on &quot;Boston Legal&quot;, &quot;House&quot;, &quot;Castle&quot;, &quot;Psych&quot; and &quot;Bones&quot;.

== Early life ==
White was born in Culver City, California, the only child of Michael White, a dentist, and Gail White, who was a homemaker. His mother later became his manager. White attended John Marshall Fundamental High School in Pasadena, California, and South Pasadena High School, and later graduating from UCLA in 2001. On the advice of his preschool teacher, White began acting as a child. He got his start on TV commercials at age three. One of White&#x27;s notable commercial appearances was for Jell-O pudding pops alongside Bill Cosby.

== Career ==
White&#x27;s first television role was a guest stint on &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, in 1984. He later auditioned for the role of Rudy Huxtable on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;. According to White, he was cast in the role (the character was originally intended to be male) but was replaced by Keshia Knight Pulliam when Bill Cosby decided to mirror his television family after his real life family. The following year, he was cast as the son of Flip Wilson and Gladys Knight on the CBS sitcom &quot;Charlie and Company&quot;. The series was intended to be CBS&#x27; answer to the highly rated &quot;Cosby Show&quot; which debuted on NBC in 1984. Unlike &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, &quot;Charlie and Company&quot; did not catch on with audiences and was canceled in May 1986. In 1987, he appeared in the pilot episode for &quot;Good Morning, Miss Bliss&quot;, and had a guest role on &quot;Mr. Belvedere&quot;. In 1988, White had a supporting role in &quot;Cadets&quot;, a sitcom starring Soleil Moon Frye. The pilot episode aired during a preview special on September 25, 1988, on ABC. The series, however, was not picked up by the network. Also during the 1980s, he appeared in a few segments of NBC&#x27;s &quot;One to Grow On&quot;.

White had a role in the NBC television film &quot;Camp Cucamonga&quot;. The film features an ensemble cast including Sherman Hemsley, Jennifer Aniston, and Brian Robbins. Several other child actors of the era including Chad Allen, Candace Cameron, Danica McKellar, Josh Saviano, and Breckin Meyer also appear.

=== &quot;Family Matters&quot; ===
At the age of 12, White originated his most famous role, Steve Urkel, on &quot;Family Matters&quot; (1989–1998). The role was initially conceived as a one-time guest appearance, but the character proved to be popular, and White was given a full-time starring role. He also played several other members of the Urkel family, including his alter ego Stefan Urquelle and Myrtle Urkel. During the height of &quot;Family Matters&quot;″ popularity, the character of Urkel was marketed with breakfast cereal (Urkel-Os) and an Urkel doll. In addition to starring in the series, White also wrote several episodes, including one, at age 19, that was the series&#x27; highest rated for that year. The series was a staple of ABC&#x27;s TGIF lineup and became one of the longest-running sitcoms with a predominantly black cast in television history.

In 1992, he was featured in &quot;The Jaleel White Special&quot;, in which he played a fictionalized version of himself making a film, while also playing Steve Urkel.

By the time the series ended in 1998, White, who was then 21 years old, was disillusioned with the role, and had been shaken by the death of his close friend and co-star Michelle Thomas from an aggressive form of stomach cancer. Shortly after the series&#x27; cancellation, he stated in a 1999 interview, &quot;If you ever see me do that character again, take me out and put a bullet in my head and put me out of my misery.&quot; White was so tightly defined by his Urkel character that he encountered difficulty finding other roles.

In later years, White came to terms with the character. In a 2011 interview with &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, he addressed the 1999 &quot;bullet&quot; quote stating, &quot;It&#x27;s one of those things that it&#x27;s very unfortunate how quotes are taken out of context. I remember that interview very vividly. I loved playing those characters ... But the fact is that I was maturing. ... To be honest, I was retarding my own growth as a man to maintain the authenticity to what I thought that character should be.&quot; When asked if he would ever reprise the Steve Urkel role, White said, &quot;I&#x27;ll always say never say never; I&#x27;m a pretty creative person. I can&#x27;t envision how I could do it in a way that would be irreverent and fun for both me and the viewing audience&quot;.

=== Other career highlights ===

White was the original English-language voice of the popular video game character Sonic the Hedgehog, having been cast in 1993 (pre-dating Martin Burke and Ryan Drummond). He voiced the character in all of the DiC-produced animated series: &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, &quot;Sonic SatAM&quot;, and &quot;Sonic Underground,&quot; as well as the Christmas special, &quot;Sonic Christmas Blast&quot;. In &quot;Underground&quot;, White also voiced Sonic&#x27;s brother and sister, Manic and Sonia.

In 1999, White returned to television in the UPN sitcom &quot;Grown Ups&quot;. The series was based around White as a young man striking out into adulthood. He also co-produced and wrote some episodes for the show, in which he starred as &quot;J&quot;, a college graduate struggling to establish his role in life as an adult. The pilot episode featured another former child actor, Soleil Moon Frye, known for her role as Punky Brewster, as the girl whom he chose as a roommate. The show received poor reviews from critics but debuted in second place in the ratings upon its premiere. However, ratings soon dropped and UPN canceled the series after one season.

White&#x27;s acting roles have not been restricted to sitcoms. He has provided his voice to several animated projects including Warner Bros.&#x27; 1998 film &quot;Quest for Camelot&quot;. In 1999, he provided the voice for a teenaged Martin Luther King Jr., in &quot;Our Friend, Martin&quot;.

In 2001, White graduated from UCLA with a degree in film and television. He has continued acting and has had small parts in the films &quot;Big Fat Liar&quot; (in a cameo role) and &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;, and was featured as the lead role in the direct-to-DVD comedy &quot;Who Made the Potatoe Salad?&quot; in 2006. In 2007, he guest-starred on the CW series &quot;The Game&quot;, followed by a role as a law school graduate interviewing for a job at Crane, Poole and Schmidt in the ABC legal drama &quot;Boston Legal&quot;.

In June 2009, White began appearing in the web series &quot;Road to the Altar&quot;. In the series, White stars as Simon, a 30-something black man marrying a young Jewish girl named Rochelle. In September 2009, White guest starred on the USA Network series &quot;Psych&quot;, as an estranged college singing buddy of the character Gus.

In June 2010, White starred in the web series &quot;Fake It Till You Make It&quot;. He also serves as writer and producer of the series. The series, which premiered on Hulu, follows the exploits of former child star Reggie Cullen (White) turned image consultant and his three protégés as they hustle to navigate Hollywood. In March 2011, White guest starred on the TBS sitcom &quot;Are We There Yet?&quot;, which reunited him with fellow &quot;Family Matters&quot; cast member Telma Hopkins. Later that same year, White appeared as the star in Cee-Lo Green&#x27;s music video for his song &quot;Cry Baby&quot;.

In October 2011, White appeared in the season 8 premiere of &quot;House&quot;, titled &quot;Twenty Vicodin&quot;, where he appears as a well-connected inmate, occasionally helping Hugh Laurie&#x27;s character Gregory House to sneak contraband into the prison. In April 2012, White began hosting the Syfy game show &quot;Total Blackout&quot;.

In March 2012, White began competing on the 14th season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. He was partnered with two-time dance champion Kym Johnson. In the opening night&#x27;s performance, White and Johnson danced the Foxtrot to &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot;. They earned a total of 26 points out of 30. White was voted off the series in May 2012.

In 2015, White appeared in a Scion commercial.

In 2017, it was announced that CBS picked up his single camera comedy series &quot;Me, Myself &amp; I&quot; with Bobby Moynihan, that premiered in September 2017. After six episodes, it was pulled from the fall schedule, leaving seven episodes unaired, with the network airing the remaining episodes in the summer.

== Personal life ==
White is a Christian. He dated actress Christine Lakin from fellow TGIF show &quot;Step by Step&quot; in the early 1990s. White has one daughter, with ex-girlfriend Bridget Hardy. On May 4, 2024, White married Nicoletta Ruhl, a sports technology business executive, in a ceremony in Los Angeles.

White is a big fan of basketball and frequently played pickup games with George Clooney, who was taping &quot;ER&quot; in the studio next door.

In 2021, White announced the launch of his line of cannabis products featuring the Purple Urkle strain, set for debut on April 20 at California dispensaries.

White released an autobiography in November 2024, where he reflects on his career and life after playing the Urkel character.

White has a memorial set up in his home for his &quot;Family Matters&quot; co-star Michelle Thomas, who died in 1998 of stomach cancer, shortly after the series had wrapped up.

<doc id="682247" wikidata="Q7808710" url="?curid=682247" title="Tioga River (Chemung River tributary)">
<text>The Tioga River ( ) is a tributary of the Chemung River, approximately long, in northern Pennsylvania and western New York in the United States. It drains a region of ridges in the northern Allegheny Plateau in the watershed of the Susquehanna River.

In the 19th century, trees logged in the Tioga Valley were extensively used in shipbuilding. Logs were floated down the Tioga to the Chemung and on to the Susquehanna River, the Chesapeake Bay, and the shipyards of Baltimore.

==Course==

The Tioga River rises in the mountains of western Bradford County and flows initially southwest into Tioga County, passing through Tioga State Forest. In southern Tioga County it turns north, cutting gaps in four separate ridges while flowing past Blossburg and Mansfield, then through Tioga Reservoir. North of Tioga it receives Crooked Creek from the west, then crosses into Steuben County, New York, near Lawrenceville, Pennsylvania. It receives the Cowanesque River from the west approximately north of the state line, then receives the Canisteo River from the west in southeastern Steuben County, approximately southwest of Corning. It joins the Cohocton River at Painted Post, just west of Corning, to form the Chemung River, a tributary of the Susquehanna.

==Tioga Reservoir==
The Tioga River has one major impoundment, the Tioga Reservoir, formed by a dam just before the borough of Tioga, Pennsylvania. The lake has a surface area of and is administered by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which built the Tioga Dam from 1973 to 1979. Built together with the adjoining Hammond Dam and Hammond Lake (on Crooked Creek), the total project cost $200 million.

The dam projects were initially authorized by the United States Congress in the Flood Control Act of 3 July 1958 (Public Law 85-500). Construction was begun in the aftermath of the devastating floods caused by Hurricane Agnes in June 1972, which resulted in widespread damage along the rivers. A channel connects the two lakes so that Hammond Lake (which has greater storage capacity) may be used to store excess (flood) water from Tioga Lake.

In addition to supporting flood control on the Chemung and Susquehanna rivers, the dams are also meant to help improve water quality by decreasing the acidity of water in the Tioga River downstream of the dams; it is diluted by addition of the more neutral waters of Crooked Creek. The Tioga River&#x27;s acidity is caused by acid mine drainage.

The lakes also offer recreational opportunities, including camping, boating, fishing, swimming, and hiking on area trails.

<text>Set It Off is a 1996 American heist drama crime action film directed by F. Gary Gray and written by Kate Lanier and Takashi Bufford. The film stars Jada Pinkett, Queen Latifah, Vivica A. Fox, and Kimberly Elise (in her film acting debut). It follows four close friends in Los Angeles, California, who plan to execute a bank robbery—each doing so for different reasons—to achieve better for themselves and their families.

The film was a box office success, grossing over $41 million against a budget of $9 million. The film earned positive reviews from critics, who praised the characters, music and performances of the cast (particularly that of Pinkett and Latifah), as well as the chemistry of the four leading actresses. The soundtrack was a commercial success, peaking at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number three on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. Additionally, the singles &quot;Set It Off&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Go (Love)&quot;, &quot;Days of Our Livez&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;Come On&quot;, &quot;Let It Go&quot; and &quot;Missing You&quot; each charted.

== Plot ==
Francesca &quot;Frankie&quot; Sutton is a Los Angeles bank teller who is fired after a robbery because she recognized one of the robbers from her Southern Californian neighborhood; the investigating detective, Strode, falsely implicates her as an inside accomplice. Frankie is forced to take a menial job at Luther&#x27;s Janitorial Services with her three best friends, Lida &quot;Stony&quot; Newsom, Cleopatra &quot;Cleo&quot; Sims, and Tisean &quot;T.T.&quot; Williams. The owner, Luther, treats them with disrespect and pays them paltry wages.

Tired of being mistreated, Frankie plans to commit a bank robbery with her friends. Cleo agrees, but Stony and T.T. are reluctant. However, after Stony&#x27;s younger brother Stevie, is gunned down by the police after being mistakenly identified as one of the robbers and T.T.&#x27;s son is taken away from her by Child Protective Services due to her son accidentally poisoning himself after T.T. brought her son to work because she didn’t have money to pay for a babysitter, they too now have the motivation to join the robbery.

While casing a bank with T.T., Stony meets bank manager Keith Weston whom she starts dating. The four women embark on a series of successful bank robberies due to Frankie&#x27;s inside knowledge of bank protocol with money and security. An investigation by the LAPD ensues. Strode suspects that Cleo (because of her prior convictions), Frankie (because of her inadvertent connection to the earlier robbery and subsequent firing) and Stony (because of her brother&#x27;s death) are involved but is unable to bring any of them in as Frankie&#x27;s careful planning has left him without sufficient evidence.

Concerned with the safety of their money, the four women stash the money in an air vent at one of their work sites. However, when Cleo, Frankie, and T.T. show up for work one day and find a new boss in charge, they quickly realize that Luther has discovered the money and fled with it. While Stony attends a banking event with Keith, ending the night with passionate lovemaking, the three women track Luther to a motel where he is sleeping with a prostitute.

The women demand the return of their money, but Luther threatens them with a gun, forcing T.T. to shoot him dead in self-defense. Cleo is soon brought in by Strode for questioning for Luther&#x27;s murder but manages to intimidate the prostitute into not identifying her. Later, after hearing what happened, Stony is disappointed and angry with Frankie and T.T. about the missing money, Luther&#x27;s death, and Cleo being brought in for a lineup. They debate robbing another bank, but Stony is reluctant and feels that the police are catching up to them. Eventually, Frankie and Cleo persuade Stony that they will skip town after pulling one final robbery.

The women decide to rob the Downtown Federal bank, the city’s largest bank and Keith&#x27;s place of work. Concerned for Keith&#x27;s safety and not wanting him to know she&#x27;s a bank robber, Stony calls Keith and tells him to meet her at a café, far from the location of the bank. The four women quickly execute the robbery, but Cleo botches the timing when she and T.T. steal more money than planned.

Strode and his partner arrive on the scene and try to talk them into surrendering. As T.T. and Stony begin to put down their weapons, a bank security guard shoots T.T. in the back. A shootout ensues as Stony shoots the guard, and an enraged Cleo opens fire on the detectives. The women eventually drive away, with Cleo shooting at the cops, though T.T. succumbs to her wounds and dies in Stony&#x27;s arms. The three remaining women attempt to outrun the police in vain. Cleo tells Stony and Frankie that they have to split up and to take her share of the money with them.

The police find Cleo, who steals a car and leads them on a high-speed chase until she is cornered. She drives through a police barricade, disabling her car, and is gunned down when she opens fire on the pursuing cops to the dismay of her girlfriend Ursula and friends from the neighborhood watching the chase on TV. A short time later, Frankie is found, and Strode demands that she surrender. After defiantly sticking a gun in Strode&#x27;s face and reminding him of how he’s a catalyst for this situation in the first place, Frankie tries to flee before getting shot and killed. Stony, who managed to blend in with a tourist group heading to Mexico, tearfully watches Frankie&#x27;s death from a passing charter bus. Strode sees her from a distance, but out of guilt for his prior actions, lets her leave.

In Mexico, Stony cuts off her hair and mourns the losses of her friends and brother. She then calls Keith to assure him that she is all right and thanks him before smiling. After hanging up, she is seen driving through the mountains with her share of the money from the last robbery beside her.

==Production==
Takashi Bufford said that he wrote the script with Pinkett Smith and Queen Latifah in mind even though he had not yet met them. The script was offered to New Line three times before finally being accepted, and the studio filled in more about why the female leads turn to bank robbery in a way that wasn&#x27;t in the original script. Later Vivica A. Fox said: “Originally, with the script, we were throwing out pages daily. Like, &#x27;No.&#x27; But that’s what you do when you have a good director who knows what he has to turn in. We were given the freedom with him to create things, and dialogue that would make sense. Everyone; once it started making sense, we came up with little moments, and it really was a team effort, to make that movie so successful.&quot;

==Release==
The film had its premiere on November 4, 1996 at Mann&#x27;s Chinese Theatre. It opened on 1,014 screens in the United States and Canada on November 6, 1996.

==Reception==
===Box office===
On a budget of $9 million and an R-rating, &quot;Set It Off&quot; grossed $36,461,139 in the United States and Canada, $5,129,747 internationally, and total of $41,590,886 worldwide. &quot;Tribute&quot; stated that it was New Line Cinema&#x27;s highest-grossing film of 1996. The film opened on Wednesday, November 6, 1996 and grossed $1.8 million from 972 theaters on its opening day, placing first at the US box office, however, for the weekend it finished behind &quot;Ransom&quot; starring Mel Gibson, which opened on the Friday, and the second week of &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot;. &quot;Set It Off&quot; grossed $8.8 million for the weekend and $11.8 million in its first five days. The film&#x27;s target audience was young African-American women but the opening day grosses suggested it reached other audiences. The grosses were also believed to have been helped by the popularity of the soundtrack, which at the time was the fifth best-selling soundtrack album of 1996. Despite the good opening, there were reports of violence in some theaters showing the film, including a shooting in Lakewood, California which left three people injured.

===Critical response===
&quot;Set It Off&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics and audiences. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 70% based on 37 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4 out of 10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;It may not boast an original plot, but &quot;Set It Off&quot; is a satisfying, socially conscious heist film thanks largely to fine performances from its leads.&quot; Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;A&quot; on scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert stated that &quot;Set It Off&quot; is &quot;a lot more&quot; than a thriller about four women who rob banks. Comparing it to &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot;, but &quot;with a strong jolt of reality,&quot; he said, &quot;It creates a portrait of the lives of these women that&#x27;s so observant and informed.&quot; He gave the film three and a half stars, and added, &quot;The movie surprised and moved me: I expected a routine action picture and was amazed how much I started to care about the characters.&quot; Gene Siskel gave it a thumbs down.

Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; compared &quot;Set It Off&quot; to &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot;, stating, &quot;In formulaic Hollywood terms, &quot;Set It Off&quot; might be described as &quot;Thelma and Louise Ride Shotgun in the Hood While Waiting to Exhale.&quot; A pop psychologist might translate the story into a fable called &quot;Women Who Rob Banks and the Society That Hates Them.&quot;&quot; He added that among &quot;the long list of Hollywood heist movies that make you root for its criminals to steal a million dollars and live happily ever after, F. Gary Gray&#x27;s film &quot;Set It Off&quot; is one of the most poignantly impassioned,&quot; and that &quot;[i]f this messy roller coaster of a film often seems to be going in several directions at once, it never for a second loses empathy&quot; for the female robbers.

James Berardinelli said that if &quot;Set It Off&quot; owes any debt to films, those films are &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; and &quot;Dead Presidents&quot;, rather than &quot;Waiting to Exhale.&quot; He stated that &quot;[t]here&#x27;s a freshness and energy in the way director F. Gary Gray attacks this familiar material that keeps &quot;Set It Off&quot; entertaining, even during its weakest moments&quot; and that &quot;[t]he concept of four black action heroines makes for a welcome change in a genre that is dominated by: (a) rugged white males with a perpetual five o&#x27;clock shadow, (b) rugged white males who speak English with an accent, and (c) rugged white males with the acting ability of a fence post.&quot; Berardinelli added that although &quot;[t]he film doesn&#x27;t get off to a promising start&quot; and &quot;[t]he first half-hour, which details the various characters&#x27; motives for becoming involved in a bank robbery, is unevenly scripted,&quot; and that some aspects of the plot are contrived, &quot;[o]nce the setup is complete, however, things shift into high gear. The remainder of the film, which includes several high-adrenaline action sequences and some slower, more dramatic moments, is smoothly-crafted. There are occasional missteps, such as an out-of-place &quot;Godfather&quot; parody, but, in general, &quot;Set It Off&quot; manages to rise above these.&quot;

Humanities academic Kara Keeling asserts the film&#x27;s significance to queer film studies within her article &#x27;&quot;What&#x27;s Up with That? She Don&#x27;t Talk?,&quot; in which she establishes Cleo and Ursula&#x27;s lesbian relationship&#x27;s significance to butch/femme representation, utilizing concepts of blaxploitation and ghettocentrism.

== Legacy ==

=== Cultural impact ===
&quot;Set It Off&quot; became known as a staple in urban cinema as a cult classic. The film was also the center of many parodies and attracted spoofs in television, YouTube and social media alike with creators and actors recreating memorable scenes from the movie, particularly the rooftop scene; Stony&#x27;s desperate decision to obtain money for her brother; the fight between Cleo and Stony and the final standoff scene. Notable social media creators and stand-up comedian/actor &quot;KevOnStage&quot; appeared as a detective in one of the 2014 parodies with content creators All Def Women, as well as social media actor and comedian Minks &quot;(officalminks)&quot; recreated and spoofed the final standoff scene in 2018.

Queen Latifah reprised her role as Cleo in a 1997 MADtv sketch with Phil Lamarr.

Queen Latifah also surprised Anthony Anderson with the cast reunion as a spoof while presenting Best Male R&amp;B artist at the 2005 BET Awards trying to antagonize and rob him of his clothing.

The climactic song &quot;Up Against the Wind&quot; sung by Lori Perry became a popular viral internet meme sound bite in the late 2010s used in many TikTok and Instagram videos.

When asked in an interview with PeopleTV about a possible sequel to the film, Pinkett-Smith said: &quot;That has been going on for years...my answer always is, there&#x27;s no way I can do &quot;Set if Off&quot; without Vivica, Queen and Kimberly, that&#x27;s just not gonna happen. Sometimes you gotta let a classic be a classic and just don&#x27;t touch it.&quot; &quot;ET Live&quot; asked Fox about the possibility of Issa Rae creating a sequel, to which she replied, &quot;It&#x27;s a classic, leave it alone. There&#x27;s absolutely no reason to try to redo it, it&#x27;s been done, and we did it so well that people are absolutely going to compare it and I think that&#x27;s her taking on a tremendous chore because that film has become a cult classic and some things are better left (alone)...create your own thing...and if it&#x27;s not good they are going to slay her for it.&quot;

&quot;Time&quot; listed &quot;Set it Off&quot; as one of &quot;The 25 Best Heist Movies&quot; in 2017.

=== Stage play adaptation ===
Stage theater director and producer Je’Caryous Johnson, a well known renowned playwright in urban stage play productions, adapted Set It Off as an Off-Broadway play titled &quot;SET IT OFF: Live on Stage&quot;, with the blessing of creator and writer of the movie, Takashi Bufford. The stage play had a multi-city tour production run in 2018 and 2021 with Da Brat starring as Cleo in both 2018 and 2021 productions. The 2018 main cast featured Kyla Pratt as Stony, LeToya Luckett as Frankie and Demetria McKinney as Tisean (T.T.). The 2021 cast featured Keshia Knight Pulliam as Tisean, Lil&#x27; Mo and Vanessa Simmons as Frankie (alternating shows), Drew Sidora, LaToya London and Marquita Goings as Stony (alternating shows) and Leon Robinson as Keith Weston. The ensemble featured James &quot;Lil&#x27; JJ&quot; Lewis, Bakesta King, Michael Finn, Ericka Pinkett, Jason Raines, Steven J. Scott and Carson Pursley.

The 2020 production run was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic which led to a few rescheduling dates to premiere in early 2021 but was again delayed and resumed in October and officially closed with its final tour run in November 2021. The stage production ran for two and a half hours. The play was received with mixed reviews.

<text>Living Single is an American television sitcom created by Yvette Denise Lee that aired for five seasons on the Fox network, from August 22, 1993, to January 1, 1998. The show centers on the lives of six New York City friends who share personal and professional experiences while living in a Brooklyn brownstone.

==Episodes==

===Plot===
&quot;Living Single&quot; centered on six friends in their 20s living the single life in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn.

The series focused on two different households in one brownstone, one shared by a trio of independent women and another shared by two male friends who had known each other since childhood while living in Cleveland, Ohio. In the first apartment, Khadijah James (Queen Latifah), a hard-working editor and publisher of the fictional urban independent magazine &quot;Flavor&quot;, lived with her sweet but naive cousin Synclaire James (Kim Coles), an aspiring actress who worked as Khadijah&#x27;s receptionist and had an affinity for Troll dolls, and her childhood friend from East Orange, New Jersey, Regina &quot;Régine&quot; Hunter (Kim Fields), an image-conscious boutique buyer who was on a constant search for a well-to-do man to spend her life (and his money) with. Later in the series, Régine became a costume assistant for the soap opera &quot;Palo Alto&quot;. When the soap was canceled, she became a wedding planner and left the apartment to move in with her fiancé Dexter Knight (Don Franklin). Maxine &quot;Max&quot; Shaw (Erika Alexander), a sharp-tongued Attorney and Khadijah&#x27;s best friend from their college days at Howard University, frequently stopped by to share her unique insights and the events of her day, to make sure that the girls&#x27; refrigerator wasn&#x27;t overstocked, and to start trouble with Kyle, looking for any chance to make his life worse.

Kyle Barker (T.C. Carson) lived in the second apartment with Overton Wakefield Jones (John Henton). Overton was the friendly but bucolic maintenance man for the owner of their (and neighboring) building, who held a deep affection for Synclaire and plenty of hilarious homespun wisdom for everyone else. Kyle was a stockbroker whose constant verbal sparring with Max did little to mask their obvious sexual attraction to each other. Kyle and Max pursued a sexual relationship, but when he decided to take a job in London and invited Max to join him, she turned him down. Maxine subsequently became distraught over her decision and, after defending a man who claimed to be the second coming of Jesus (Harold Perrineau), she began to take her life more seriously. Through a series of events, Max decided that her purpose must be to become a mother. During the insemination process, she unknowingly picked Kyle&#x27;s sperm specimen based on a list of qualities she would like for her child to have. Kyle returned in the series finale, and the two reconciled. Overton and Synclaire also got together, and their relationship culminated in marriage by the end of the fourth season. In season five, they moved in together, leaving Overton and Kyle&#x27;s apartment open for new character Roni DeSantos (Idalis DeLeon), a New York-area D.J., to move in. It was eventually revealed that DeSantos had a fling with Ira Lee &quot;Tripp&quot; Williams III, (Mel Jackson), a songwriter whom Khadijah and Régine allowed to move in when Synclaire&#x27;s room became available. Synclaire joined a comedy improv troupe where she gained the attention of Tony Jonas, a Warner Bros. Television executive who cast her as a nun for a new comedy series he was developing.

Along with trying to make &quot;Flavor&quot; a success, Khadijah also looked for Mr. Right. She eventually found him in childhood friend Scooter (Cress Williams), with whom she left the brownstone for the final time in the series finale.

Warner Home Video released the complete first season of &quot;Living Single&quot; on DVD in Region 1 on February 14, 2006.
The entire series is also available for digital download on Amazon.com and the iTunes Store.

Warner Archive subsequently released seasons 2–5 on DVD in Region 1. These are Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) releases, available from Warner&#x27;s online store and Amazon.com.

==Production==
Queen Latifah and Kim Coles both had development deals with Fox. In March 1993, Fox announced that Queen Latifah and Coles would star in a comedy sitcom called &quot;My Girls&quot;, about roommates in New York City. The character of Khadijah was created for Queen Latifah. Khadijah is an entrepreneur who started an urban-lifestyle magazine, much as Latifah is an entrepreneur who started her hip-hop record label. Fox changed the show&#x27;s name to &quot;Living Single&quot; three weeks before its television debut.

Creator Yvette Lee Bowser&#x27;s initial goal was to develop a show about herself and her friends that would change the portrayal of young Black people on television. Her overall goal was to portray Black characters positively and less stereotypically. She also noted that the women represented on &quot;Living Single&quot; are four different sides of herself, saying in an interview, &quot;I&#x27;ve been as ditsy as Synclaire, as superficial as Regine, as bitter as Max, and as focused and driven as Khadijah.&quot;

In May 1997, Fox announced that it had ordered 13 episodes of the fifth season of &quot;Living Single&quot; but would be delayed until January 1998. Three months later, Fox made a change to its fall schedule, delayed the airing of a new comedy called &quot;Rewind&quot;, and decided to debut &quot;Living Single&quot;″s fifth season on September 11. The final episode of the fifth season aired on January 1, 1998.

==Crossovers==
*&quot;The Crew&quot;: In one episode &quot;The Mating Season&quot; of the short-lived Fox sitcom &quot;The Crew&quot;, Regine becomes a passenger on a flight and argues with a sassy stewardess in hopes of upgrading to first class. In another episode, &quot;The Worst Noel,&quot; Synclaire also becomes a passenger. The episode served as a bridge for &quot;The Crew&quot; and its lead-in show, &quot;Living Single&quot;.
*&quot;Half &amp; Half&quot;: Erika Alexander and T.C. Carson reprised their roles of Maxine Shaw and Kyle Barker on the UPN sitcom, &quot;Half &amp; Half&quot; (a series produced by &quot;Living Single&quot; creator Yvette Lee Bowser). In the episode (&quot;The Big Performance Anxiety Episode,&quot; third season), ambitious law student Dee Dee learns that her mother&#x27;s co-star,Kyle, in a play is engaged to Maxine, Dee Dee&#x27;s idol. However, her mother gets Maxine&#x27;s beau, fired because she fears he will take attention away from her. The episode also revealed that Maxine and Kyle remained a couple and were the proud parents of their seven-year-old daughter named Kyla.

==Syndication==
&quot;Living Single&quot; started reruns in syndication on September 22, 1997, through various Fox, UPN, and WB affiliates; these were later CW affiliates in terms of UPN and WB. The series formerly reran on USA Network, Logo TV, BET, and Oxygen. Syndication carriage on the local level fizzled out in 2006. Reruns of the series currently run daily on cable networks TV One, MTV2, Bounce TV, Dabl, WCIU and VH1. As of January 11, 2018, all episodes began streaming on Hulu, and on HBO Max as of September 22, 2022.

==Reunion specials==
An hour-long retrospective special, &quot;Living Single: The Reunion Show&quot;, aired on TV One on September 22, 2008. Coles, Henton, Fields, Carson and Alexander reunited to share fond memories with the fans. Queen Latifah and Mel Jackson were unavailable to participate. The special featured clips and revealing secrets of the cast from the show&#x27;s five-year run.

From August 24 to 26, 2018, TV One aired a weekend marathon of &quot;Living Single&quot; to highlight the 25th anniversary of the show. Coles, Henton, Fields, and Carson reunited once again to share memories with the fans, to share their thoughts on the characters they portrayed and provided a tribute to Rita Owens (Queen Latifah&#x27;s real-life and TV mother), who had passed in early 2018. Queen Latifah, Erika Alexander and Mel Jackson were unavailable to participate.

== Reception ==
During &quot;Living Single&quot;″s first season, it consistently garnered higher ratings than &quot;Martin&quot;, which aired in the time slot immediately before it on Thursday nights, and it quickly became the fourth highest-rated show aired on Fox among their 12 current series.

Throughout its run, &quot;Living Single&quot; became one of the most popular African-American sitcoms of its era, ranking amongst the top five in African-American ratings in all five seasons. Newspaper critics contrasted &quot;Living Single&quot; with the NBC sitcom &quot;Friends&quot; which was inspired by the post-college experiences of Marta Kauffman and David Crane and in development around November 1993 after the cult show premiered. &quot;Living Single&quot; featured successful Black characters including an attorney, a stockbroker, and a business owner, in contrast to &quot;Friends&quot;, which featured a White cast including a waitress, a folk singer, and an unemployed actor. Show creator Yvette Lee Bowser was disappointed that Warner Bros. Television did not promote &quot;Living Single&quot; nearly as much as it did &quot;Friends&quot;.

&quot;Living Single&quot; was never one of the highest-rated programs among audiences during its run from 1993 to 1998. Indeed, the show had struggled to break into lists of top television programs viewed by larger audiences and never broke into the Top 50, though it was a higher performer for the Fox network itself. Those who loved and watched the show regularly have told show creator Yvette Lee Bowser that they connect with its characters, love the cast, and are inspired by the positive, elegant, and professional portrayal of Black people on television. Bowser noted that &quot;People say our characters remind them of themselves, their friends or their relatives. They all know someone like one of the characters.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
In 1995 and 1996, &quot;Living Single&quot; was nominated for Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lighting Direction (Electronic) for a Comedy Series (Bryan Hays).

<text>Muse Watson Gravel (born Robert Gravel; July 20, 1948), commonly known as Muse Watson, is an American actor. He is notable for his recurring roles of Mike Franks on &quot;NCIS&quot; and Charles Westmoreland / D.B. Cooper in &quot;Prison Break&quot;, and film roles as Hank Corrigan in &quot;Something to Talk About&quot;, and Ben Willis, the killer in &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; and &quot;I Still Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;.

==Early life==
Watson was born and raised in Alexandria, Louisiana. His father died when he was five years old, and Watson and his three siblings were raised by their mother and maternal grandfather. Watson said his grandfather had a big influence on him, and after finding out that Robert Gravel was already registered with the Screen Actors Guild, he legally changed his name to Muse Watson Gravel, in honor of his grandfather. Watson graduated from Bolton High School in 1966, and then attended Louisiana Tech for two years on a music scholarship. After leaving Louisiana Tech, he transferred to Berea College in Berea, Kentucky. 

It was at Berea College where he became interested in acting, scoring a role as Petruchio in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;. He then left Berea and went on the road starring in productions of &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; and &quot;Promises, Promises&quot;. After a year of touring, he returned to Berea, but at graduation time, he was told his degree would be withheld because he hadn&#x27;t &quot;gone to church enough&quot;. He decided to leave school and moved to Oak Ridge, Tennessee to live with his sister. He worked for Pathway Bellows for seven years before moving to Chattanooga, Tennessee to work as a manufacturing representative, while still making time for auditions and plays. 

==Career==
Watson is credited with appearing in more than 60 movies and 50 television episodes. He is best known for his recurring roles of Mike Franks on &quot;NCIS&quot; and Charles Westmoreland in &quot;Prison Break&quot;, and as Ben Willis, the killer in the horror films, &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; and &quot;I Still Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;, and as the vampire C. W. Niles in &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn 2&quot;.

Other notable appearances include: &quot;American Outlaws&quot;, &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot;, &quot;A Day Without a Mexican&quot;, &quot;Dead Birds&quot;, &quot;Down in the Valley&quot;, &quot;IOWA&quot;, &quot;Morgan&#x27;s Ferry&quot; and &quot;Songcatcher&quot;.

When Watson was living in Chattanooga, he was hired to do extras casting for &quot;King Kong Lives&quot;. He also made connections with people in the North Carolina film industry and became a Teamster, building his own fleet of trucks that he hired out for productions on the East Coast. After a guest appearance on &quot;Matlock&quot; and his role in &quot;Something to Talk About&quot;, he moved to Los, Angeles where Marion Dougherty helped him in obtaining an agent. Watson said he considers his appearance in the film &quot;Something to Talk About&quot; as his &quot;breakout role&quot;.

He has also directed theater for the Tennessee Performing Arts Center and the Bessie Smith Foundation, taught acting at the Georgia State Prison, and taught reading and writing at Berea College&#x27;s literacy outreach program. Before changing his name to Muse Watson, he had credits as Robert Gavel, working as a stunt driver in &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; and &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot;. In the film &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;, Watson performed the majority of his own stunts, which included a very long underwater sequence. 

In 2002, he was nominated for best supporting actor for his role in &quot;If I Die Before I Wake&quot; at the Fangoria Chainsaw Awards, and in 2011, won best actor for his performance in &quot;A Christmas Snow&quot;, at the Trail Dance Film Festival.

Watson starred in a stage adaptation of the TV movie &quot;A Christmas Snow&quot; at the Starlite Theater in Branson, Missouri.

==Personal life==
Watson is married and has a daughter with autism, for which he has become an advocate.

<doc id="682270" wikidata="Q5291784" url="?curid=682270" title="Royal Hibernian Academy">
<text>The Royal Hibernian Academy of Arts (RHA) is an artist-based and artist-oriented institution in Ireland, founded in Dublin in 1823. Like many other Irish institutions, such as the Royal Irish Academy, the academy retained the word &quot;Royal&quot; after most of Ireland became independent as the Irish Free State in December 1922.

==History==

The RHA was founded as the result of 30 Irish artists petitioning the government for a charter of incorporation. According to the letters patent of 5 August 1823, The Royal Hibernian Academy of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture was established, which included a National School of Art. The first elected president was the landscape painter, William Ashford. In 1824 architect Francis Johnston was made president. He had provided headquarters for the RHA at Academy House in Lower Abbey Street at his own expense. The first exhibitions took place in May 1825 and were held annually from then on. To encourage interest in the arts, works displayed at the RHA were distributed by lot as prizes among subscribers. Works by Frederick William Burton, Daniel Maclise, J. M. W. Turner and David Wilkie, among others, were presented in this way. The exhibitions and school prospered and by the end of the 19th century the RHA was the leading Irish institution involved in promoting visual arts. 

Academy House was destroyed by fire in 1916 during the Easter Rising, as was most of the RHA&#x27;s collection. Over 500 pieces of art, including from artists Jack Butler Yeats, Madeline Green and John Lavery, were lost. The RHA was would not have its own exhibition premises for another 69 years, but continued with its established annual exhibitions.

In 1943, the Irish Exhibition of Living Art (IELA) was founded as a direct challenge to the RHA&#x27;s exhibition policies, which it saw as reactionary and hindering the development of modernism in Ireland. This later changed, with one of the founders of the IELA, Louis le Brocquy, becoming a member of the Honorary Council of the RHA. The RHA&#x27;s current mission statement explicitly values both contemporary and traditional art forms.

In the 1970s the RHA constructed a new building in Ely Place in Dublin. This building replaced the gallery&#x27;s previous premises, a Victorian house that had been home to Oliver St. John Gogarty. This was demolished and the property developer, Matt Gallagher, agreed to build a modern gallery on the site for the RHA. After the sudden death of Gallagher in January 1974, it emerged that he had left no provision in his will for the completion of the gallery. The building lay unfinished for a number of years before it was completed. The building was closed between 2007 and 2009 for renovations. This building houses six galleries; here the Academy mounts the annual exhibition. In addition, the Academy curates frequent exhibitions and frequently is responsible for major retrospectives of the work of Irish artists. The Academy has a large collection of Irish art, but this is not on display.

In 2009 the RHA refounded its school, the RHA drawing school. In Ely Place, it has a large drawing studio and 6 studios which are available to artists through open submissions. Other studios are also administered by the school, such as the Tony O&#x27;Malley residency in Kilkenny. It runs TUD-accredited courses (since 2018) in Painting and drawing techniques delivered by a faculty made up of Academy members and other artists. Current tutors are Colin Martin RHA (principal), Mick O&#x27;Dea PPRHA, Una Sealy RHA, Blaise Smith RHA, Geraldine O&#x27;Neill RHA, Sahoko Blake, Conor Walton, Raphael Hynes and Sean Molloy among others. It also holds workshops with international tutors and self-directed life-drawing sessions.

The Academy is funded by: the Arts Council of Ireland (An Chomhairle Ealaíon), through revenue from its Annual Exhibition, and from Benefactors, Patrons and Friends of the Academy.

== Selected exhibitions ==

The RHA has held an annual exhibition – an open submission art show – since 1826. It is &quot;the largest in Ireland and the longest-running&quot;.

FUTURES (originally EuroJet Futures) is an ongoing series of exhibitions featuring selected emerging artists from Ireland. It began in 2001 and has had three series – each with annual exhibitions. Additionally, each series has had an &#x27;anthology&#x27; presenting all of the artists from that series together.

==Membership==
The Academy recognises members, who may use &quot;RHA&quot;, associate members &quot;ARHA&quot;, and Honorary Council members &quot;HRHA&quot;.

<text>Wholesale Meats and Fish is the second album by the alternative rock band Letters to Cleo, released in 1995. The first single was &quot;Awake&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote that &quot;&#x27;Little Rosa&#x27;, the album&#x27;s highlight, is &#x27;60s-influenced jangle-pop genius.&quot; 

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; opined that &quot;too often singer Kay Hanley sounds like a petulant Juliana Hatfield on their soapy, overdramatic love songs.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; compared the album to its predecessor, calling it &quot;the same alt-rock in a different package&quot;. It said that, while Hanley&#x27;s &quot;bright, clear delivery often lifts Letters to Cleo above college-band status, her happiness can become wearing&quot;.

<text>The Preacher&#x27;s Wife is a 1996 American Christmas fantasy comedy-drama film directed by Penny Marshall and starring Denzel Washington, Whitney Houston (in her last film released during her lifetime), and Courtney B. Vance. It is a remake of the 1947 film &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Wife&quot;, which in turn was based on the 1928 novel of the same name by Robert Nathan.

It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score. The film was nominated for six NAACP Image Awards, including Outstanding Motion Picture, and won two—for Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture (Whitney Houston) and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture (Loretta Devine). In addition, the film won two awards at the Movieguide Awards, including the Epiphany Award for Most Inspiring Movie and the Best Movie for Families Award.

==Plot==
A voiceover by the preacher&#x27;s son Jeremiah Biggs guides the viewer through the film.

Reverend Henry Biggs is the pastor of a small struggling African American Baptist church in a poverty-stricken neighborhood of New York City. Membership is declining, Henry is pulled in a hundred directions by his parishioners&#x27; needs, and the church&#x27;s finances are in trouble. Henry is under intense pressure from real estate developer Joe Hamilton to sell the church&#x27;s property so that Hamilton can build luxury condominiums on the site. Henry has also become neglectful of his wife Julia and his son Jeremiah. Julia worries that her marriage is failing. Unsure that he can make a difference in his parishioners&#x27; lives and beginning to lose his faith, Henry prays to God for help, which comes in the form of Dudley, a witty and debonair angel. Dudley tells Henry that he is an angel sent by God to help him, but Henry is deeply suspicious of Dudley. Julia, however, is instantly charmed by the handsome and unflappable angel.

With Christmas approaching, Henry&#x27;s schedule becomes increasingly burdensome, and Dudley begins to spend most of his time with Julia and Jeremiah. Henry&#x27;s secretary Beverly becomes comically defensive and aggressive, believing Dudley is there to take her job. Julia&#x27;s wasp-tongued mother, Margueritte is also suspicious of Dudley, because she believes the newcomer will break up her daughter&#x27;s marriage. Dudley and Julia go ice skating, and then later spend an evening in the jazz club where Julia once performed. After Henry confronts Dudley, Dudley realizes that he is falling in love with Julia. So, Dudley turns his attention to Hamilton and manages to disrupt his schemes to get Henry to sell the church. Henry now realizes that his family is the most important thing in his life, and he resolves to be a better husband and father. At the church&#x27;s Christmas pageant, Henry finds his faith in God renewed and ties to his family restored.

With his work done, Dudley gives the Biggs family a fully decorated Christmas tree as a gift. Dudley then erases all memories of himself from everyone he has met, and although he attends morning service on Christmas Eve, no one recognizes him. However, Jeremiah, who has the faith of a child, still remembers Dudley, and wishes him a merry Christmas.

==Cast==
==Production==
The motion picture was developed by Denzel Washington&#x27;s Mundy Lane Entertainment. The screenplay was written by Nat Mauldin and Allan Scott. Credits are given to Robert E. Sherwood and Leonardo Bercovici for the 1947 film &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Wife&quot;, and to author Robert Nathan (for his novel &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Wife&quot;).

The role of Julia was written with Whitney Houston in mind. Denzel Washington says that he first considered Julia Roberts for the role, but quickly turned to Whitney Houston. Houston admitted that she was reluctant to accept, feeling she could not do justice to a role that required her to play a dowdy housewife. Only after reading the script a second time and seeing parallels between her own life and the role of Julia did Houston accept. Houston was paid $10 million to appear in the film, making her the highest paid black actress at the time and third highest paid film actress of 1996.

&quot;The Preacher&#x27;s Wife&quot; was the third film produced by Washington&#x27;s company &quot;Mundy Lane Entertainment.&quot; For Washington, the movie was a meaningful project due to its message about the value of family, community, and faith. Moreover, as Washington reflected to &quot;Variety&quot; magazine, the film provided opportunities for those underrepresented in show business:&quot;I’m happy to know that on a film like ‘Devil in a Blue Dress’ we put 100 or so many black people to work, and it was the same with ‘The Preacher’s Wife,’ [Washington] said. “And it will be the same thing with other films that I’m involved in, whether I’m on a producer level or not. We do it because they’re capable and because nobody else is necessarily looking out for them,” he says of African-American talent.Filming began in early January 1996. Trinity United Methodist Church in Newark, New Jersey, served as the Biggs&#x27; New York City church. The production leased the church, and began renovating it in February 1996. The interior was painted, new carpet laid, and the main doors repaired. The production team designed a pulpit and altar rails that more accurately reflected the design of Baptist churches. After filming, the church kept the pulpit, and the production crew worked with architects from the United Methodist Church to design and install rails more fitting of the Methodist style. Filming occurred there from March 11 to April 3, with about a quarter of the church&#x27;s membership hired as extras. (The church used the rental fees paid by the production to replace its boiler and HVAC system.)

Production was plagued by poor weather and accidents. Interior sets were constructed at Chelsea Piers, a film and television production facility in Manhattan, New York. Severe snowstorms in New Jersey (where scenes were shot in Paterson) and New York (where scenes were shot throughout New York City) cost the production several shooting days. Later, the cast and crew moved to Portland, Maine, to scenes which occur at an ice skating rink, but unseasonably warm weather turned the ice to water and forced the production to rent snow-making machines. The production filmed in several crime-ridden areas of New York City to achieve authenticity. Robberies were common in the area, leaving the cast and crew nervous. While filming exteriors and interiors at a church and parsonage in Yonkers, New York, a building a block away caught fire and two children died. One crew member rushed a ladder from the production to the burning building, and saved the life of a four-year-old child. Accidents also affected the production. The weekend before filming began at the church, an elderly parishioner fell, broke her hip and died. In the middle of filming, a crew member was struck by a car and killed. The production schedule was also impacted by Houston&#x27;s decision only to shoot scenes with vocal performances during the afternoon.

Filming was scheduled to wrap at the end of February, but the crew was still shooting at the beginning of May. Some final scenes shot were those at the Main Street Cafe in Tarrytown, New York. The entire street had to be dressed for Christmas in fake snow laid down along the street.

Lionel Richie made his acting debut in the film as the owner of the jazz club.

==Soundtrack==

&quot;The Preacher&#x27;s Wife&quot; is the best-selling gospel album of all time. The album also remained at number-one for a record twenty-six weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Gospel Albums Chart. The Georgia Mass Choir appears in the film. The soundtrack to the film (performed by Whitney Houston) consists of gospel numbers and includes performances by Monica, Faith Evans, the three members of New Edition who embarked on solo careers (Bobby Brown, who was Houston&#x27;s real-life husband at the time, Ralph Tresvant and Johnny Gill), Cissy Houston and Shirley Caesar among others. Houston sang Richard Smallwood&#x27;s in the film. A favorite song of hers since childhood, it gained renewed popularity when it was heard in the film.

==Reception==
Stephen Holden, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called the film &quot;sweetly uplifting&quot; and &quot;a shrewdly conceived update&quot;, and had high praise for actress Jenifer Lewis and the funny scene where the children in the Christmas pageant cannot recall their lines. Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; also found the film &quot;warm, sentimental, amusing yet serious&quot; and an &quot;inspired reworking&quot; of the 1947 original. He singled out Penny Marshall&#x27;s directing for being &quot;consistently wise and judicious&quot;, and praised Jenifer Lewis and Loretta Devine. Critic Roger Ebert gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, but was a bit equivocal in his review, concluding: &quot;&quot;The Preacher&#x27;s Wife&quot; is a sweet and good-hearted comedy about the holiday season. ... This movie could have done more, but what it does, it makes you feel good about.&quot;

Duane Byrge, writing for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, also felt the film uneven. Although he found it heart-warming, he wrote that it had a &quot;patchy narrative&quot; and felt the film made Washington and Houston such great characters that it was hard to see why the Biggs&#x27; marriage should survive. Too often, he concluded, the plot seemed nothing more than a means of stringing together terrific musical performances by Houston and the Georgia Mass Choir. Byrge found Penny Marshall&#x27;s directing slow at times but felt that casting director Paula Herold had done wonders. He singled out Courtney B. Vance as an appealing if downbeat husband, Jenifer Lewis as the &quot;sassy&quot; mother-in-law, and Loretta Devine as Bigg&#x27;s defensive, aggressive secretary who thinks Dudley is there to replace her. Marshall, Byrge said, was more effective directing these lively characters (and actors) than the film&#x27;s stars.

In contrast, Caren Weiner Campbell, writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, found Denzel Washington to be lackluster (though the gospel singing scenes were quite good). Her strongest criticism was directed at the screenplay. She felt the script had too many subplots, with the narrative by the character of Jeremiah was &quot;sappy&quot;, and was lacking in the &quot;fun miracles&quot; of the original. She also criticized Marshall&#x27;s directing for being slow and tedious. Unlike other reviewers, Jackie Potts in &quot;Miami Herald&quot; felt the characters were dated and not updated. She found Courtney B. Vance&#x27;s acting humorless, and was highly critical of Whitney Houston&#x27;s acting. &quot;[Houston] sleepwalks through scenes as the dignified mother, doing little more than tucking her 6-year-old son (Justin Pierre Edmund) in. It&#x27;s not a showy role, but Houston plays it as if the frost outdoors has settled on her shoulders&quot;. While she had high praise for Denzel Washington (he &quot;plays Dudley with a 100-watt smile and childlike sense of wonder&quot;), she had little to say for Penny Marshall&#x27;s directing. It was, she concluded, slow and the overall tone of the film &quot;strangely solemn&quot;—with only minor relief given by Jenifer Lewis&#x27; biting, scathingly funny turn as a tart-tongued mother.

&quot;The Preacher&#x27;s Wife&quot; currently holds rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Solid performances and a steady directorial hand help &quot;The Preacher&#x27;s Wife&quot; offer some reliably heartwarming – albeit fairly predictable – holiday cheer.&quot;

===Box office===
The film grossed $56,432,646 worldwide, of which $48,102,795 was in the US, ranking &quot;The Preacher&#x27;s Wife&quot; as #33 in domestic box office receipts for movies released in 1996. The movie&#x27;s US gross was only slightly below that of &quot;Evita&quot; ($50 million) and above those for &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot; ($46.3 million) and &quot;One Fine Day&quot; ($46.2 million).

Although considered a respectable performance, &quot;The Preacher&#x27;s Wife&quot; underperformed studio expectations given its $60 million production budget plus an additional $15 million in marketing expenses. Industry insiders had hoped that &quot;The Preacher&#x27;s Wife&quot; would attract a significant crossover audience due to its two high-profile mainstream stars and heavily promoted soundtrack album. &quot;Whitney is her own built-in marketing machine,&quot; a studio marketing chief told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; prior to the film&#x27;s release, referring to Houston&#x27;s widespread appeal at the time.

<text>Consenting Adults is a 1992 American thriller film directed by Alan J. Pakula, and stars Kevin Kline, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Kevin Spacey and Rebecca Miller. The original music score was composed by Michael Small. The film&#x27;s tagline is: &quot;Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor&#x27;s wife.&quot;

==Plot==
Composer Richard Parker and his wife Priscilla live an ordinary suburban life until they meet their new neighbors Eddy and Kay Otis. The two couples become friends. Kay&#x27;s talent for blues singing gets Richard&#x27;s attention, while Eddy is attracted to Priscilla. It becomes clear that Eddy is a scam artist when he fakes a neck injury after an auto accident for the insurance proceeds (the majority of which he offers to the Parkers as a gift). Eddy chastises Richard for not living dangerously, and suggests they swap mates for an evening.

The plot takes a nasty turn when Richard does sleep with Kay (supposedly without her realizing that he is not her husband) and Kay turns up dead the next morning, bludgeoned to death by a baseball bat. Later, it is revealed that Eddy spent the night elsewhere in order to establish an airtight alibi. Richard&#x27;s semen is found in her body, and his fingerprints are on the bat (from when the two couples played a friendly game of softball earlier the previous day), so he&#x27;s charged with the crime. Priscilla disowns and divorces Richard due to his infidelity. Eddy soon becomes Priscilla&#x27;s lover and a substitute father to Richard&#x27;s daughter, Lori.

A distraught Richard finally finds a ray of hope when he hears Kay singing in a radio talent show and realizes she&#x27;s alive. With the help of private investigator David Duttonville, who was hired by the insurance company from which Eddy is attempting to collect a $1.5 million indemnity claim, Richard tracks her down and learns the truth of how he was betrayed. Kay is guilt-ridden over her part in it, but terrified by Eddy&#x27;s threat to implicate her if she testifies. Eddy, anticipating what Richard intends to do next, murders Kay and slips away. Implicated in a second murder, Richard flees the scene as police sirens approach.

Priscilla discovers a plane ticket Eddy used on the night of the second murder. Realizing Eddy&#x27;s guilt, she worries over what to do about it. Richard performs a commando-style raid on Eddy&#x27;s house, but Eddy, anticipating this move as well, reveals to Priscilla his plan to murder her and shoot Richard as a homicidal intruder. Working together, Richard and Priscilla eventually kill Eddy using the original murder weapon, the baseball bat. Richard and Priscilla are later seen moving into a very secluded house with no neighbors visible for miles.

<doc id="682285" wikidata="Q1370588" url="?curid=682285" title="New Edition">
<text>New Edition is an American R&amp;B/pop group from the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, formed in 1978 by singer/rapper Bobby Brown. Their name is taken to mean a new edition of the Jackson 5. The group reached its height of popularity in the 1980s and is considered the blueprint for what would become the modern boy band. The lineup originally consisted of Ricky Bell, Michael Bivins, Ronnie DeVoe, Bobby Brown, and Ralph Tresvant. Brown left the group in late 1985 to begin a successful solo career, and they continued as a quartet for one album, before adding Johnny Gill to the lineup in 1987. Early hits included &quot;Candy Girl&quot;, &quot;Cool It Now&quot;, and &quot;Mr. Telephone Man&quot;. Tresvant was the lead singer on most of the songs. In 1990, both Gill and Tresvant released their own solo albums, while the remaining three members formed the trio Bell Biv DeVoe; the group ceased to work together for the first half of the 1990s.

All six members of New Edition reunited in 1996 to record the group&#x27;s sixth studio album &quot;Home Again&quot;. During the ill-fated &quot;Home Again Tour&quot;, both Brown and Bivins quit the group, forcing the remainder of the tour to be canceled. Various reunions have occurred since, usually with the 1987–1990 lineup, though occasionally also including Brown. Their last studio album was 2004&#x27;s &quot;One Love&quot;.

On May 3, 2011, New Edition issued a press release on their official website announcing that all six members were reuniting as New Edition to kick off the 30th anniversary celebration of &quot;Candy Girl&quot; with their fans. They received their star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on January 23, 2017. On January 24, 2017, a three-part docuseries, &quot;The New Edition Story&quot;, premiered on BET about the group&#x27;s career and personal life. It was later announced that all six members will reunite to record another album and go on tour. On February 17, 2022, the group was inducted into the Black Music &amp; Entertainment Walk of Fame.

On December 31, 2022, New Edition performed on &quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rocking Eve&quot; with Ryan Seacrest. All six members were in attendance and performed various songs from both their group and solo careers. On September 24, 2023, in Farmington Hills, Michigan, New Edition was inducted into the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame.

==Career==
===19781985: Rise to stardom===

The group was formed by Bobby Brown and his childhood friends in the Orchard Park Projects of Roxbury, Boston. The group then scored its big break in 1982, performing at the local Hollywood Talent Night held at Boston&#x27;s Strand Theatre by singer/producer Maurice Starr. The first prize was $500 and a recording contract. Although the group came in second place, an impressed Starr decided to bring the group to his studio the following day to record what would become their debut album, &quot;Candy Girl&quot;. Released on July 19th, 1983 on New York producer Arthur Baker&#x27;s Levi Belt Streetwise Records, the album featured the hits: &quot;Is This the End&quot;, &quot;Popcorn Love&quot;, and the title track &quot;Candy Girl,&quot; which went to number one on both the American R&amp;B singles chart and the UK singles chart.

Returning from their first major concert tour, the boys were dropped off back at their homes in the projects and were given a check in the amount of $1.87 apiece for their efforts. Tour budget and expenses were given as the explanation as to why they were not paid more. Due to these financial reasons, New Edition parted with Starr in 1984. Starr responded by promptly creating the group New Kids on the Block, essentially formatted after New Edition, but with white teenagers. Meanwhile, the group employed the law firm of Steven and Martin Machat and sued Streetwise for release from a contract that was unenforceable as well as materially breached by Streetwise. The Machats won the legal game and then secured the group a bigger recording deal with major label MCA Records, which won the bidding war among various other major labels. In need of management, the group signed with Steven Machat and his two management partners Rick Smith and Bill Dern. The management company, AMI, proceeded to escalate the group&#x27;s profile in both the urban and pop music worlds. Through the production affiliate of AMI, Jump and Shoot, MCA released the group&#x27;s self-titled second album the same year. Eclipsing their debut album, &quot;New Edition&quot; spun off the top five hit &quot;Cool It Now&quot; and the top twenty &quot;Mr. Telephone Man&quot;, and went on to be certified double platinum in the United States.

While promoting their second album, the group was dismayed to realize that they were not actually signed to MCA Records, but instead with the production company Jump and Shoot, which had its own deal with MCA; subsequently, all business matters pertaining to the group were controlled by the former. To buy themselves out of the stifling production deal, each of the five members borrowed $100,000 from MCA. Though it effectively separated the group from Jump and Shoot and allowed them to sign a new long-term contract to record for MCA directly, they were now in mortgage to the label. As a result, the group would be forced to continually record and tour during this period in order to pay off its debt.

New Edition&#x27;s third album, &quot;All for Love&quot;, was released in the latter half of 1985. While not duplicating the success of its predecessor, the album was certified platinum, and spawned the hits &quot;Count Me Out&quot;, &quot;A Little Bit Of Love (Is All It Takes)&quot;, and &quot;With You All the Way&quot;. The growing popularity of the group led to a guest appearance (as themselves) in the 1985 film &quot;Krush Groove&quot;, performing &quot;My Secret&quot;. Toward the year&#x27;s end, &quot;Christmas All Over the World&quot;, a holiday EP, was released as well as an oldies album of tunes from the &#x27;50s sung by the group with an &#x27;80s production style.

===19851989: Bobby Brown&#x27;s departure, Johnny Gill&#x27;s introduction and &quot;Heart Break&quot;===
Bobby Brown embarked on a solo career in 1986, while New Edition continued to promote &quot;All for Love&quot; as a quartet. In spite of their financial and internal conflicts, New Edition continued to peak. During this era of the group&#x27;s evolution, the group appeared in the episode of &quot;Knight Rider&quot; titled &quot;Knight Song&quot;, performing &quot;Count Me Out&quot;. As 1986 wound to a close, they recorded a cover of The Penguins&#x27; 1954 hit &quot;Earth Angel&quot; for the soundtrack to &quot;The Karate Kid, Part II&quot;. The song peaked at number twenty-one and inspired the group to record &quot;Under the Blue Moon&quot;, an album of doo-wop covers.

After having already lost a member when Brown was terminated from the group, New Edition&#x27;s future became uncertain when murmurings began to surface that Tresvant was eyeing a solo career as well. To pad his potential departure, singer Johnny Gill was voted into the group by Ricky Bell, Michael Bivins and Ronnie DeVoe in 1987, despite Tresvant ultimately deciding to remain in place. A native of Washington, D.C., Gill is the only non-Boston native among the group&#x27;s six members.

New Edition&#x27;s fifth studio release, &quot;Heart Break&quot;, was released in the summer of 1988. Primarily produced by the production team of Jimmy Jam &amp; Terry Lewis, the album was a departure from the group&#x27;s previous bubblegum sound, and instead took on a smoother, stronger, and more adult resonance. Spinning off five hit singles: &quot;If It Isn&#x27;t Love&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Not My Kind of Girl&quot;, &quot;Can You Stand the Rain&quot;, &quot;Crucial&quot; and &quot;N.E. Heartbreak&quot;; &quot;Heart Break&quot; became New Edition&#x27;s most commercially successful album up to that point, certified double platinum in the United States. The success of &quot;Heart Break&quot; would launch the group on a successful concert tour as well in the closing months of 1988, with N.E. serving as the headliners while Al B. Sure and former member Bobby Brown served as the opening acts.

===19901995: Solo projects===
Inspired by the substantial success Brown was having with his multi-platinum 1988 breakthrough album &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot;, after the run of &quot;Heart Break&quot;, New Edition went on hiatus to pursue side projects away from the group. At the suggestion of producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, Bell, Bivins and DeVoe formed a trio, Bell Biv DeVoe. Their 1990 debut album, &quot;Poison&quot;, went quadruple platinum. The same year, Tresvant and Gill (who had already recorded as a solo act prior to joining New Edition) released self-titled solo albums, which also achieved multi-platinum success. Later that year, the group, including Brown, had a semi-reunion of sorts when they performed at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards. In 1991, all six members again reunited to record a remix of the Bell Biv DeVoe track &quot;Word to the Mutha!&quot;; Brown, Gill and Tresvant also appeared in the music video. Prior to this, Brown also appeared in the music videos for Bell Biv DeVoe&#x27;s &quot;BBD (I Thought It Was Me)&quot; video, as well as Tresvant&#x27;s &quot;Stone Cold Gentleman&quot; and &quot;Sensitivity&quot; remix videos.

===19961997: &quot;Home Again&quot; reunion and hiatus===
By 1996, the members of New Edition had arguably achieved greater commercial success with their own side projects than the group had during its run. However, after having promised fans that there would be a reunion — and still contractually owing MCA Records another New Edition album — the group, with Brown, reunited to record &quot;Home Again&quot;, their first new album in eight years. The album debuted at number one on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and R&amp;B Albums chart, and became the most commercially successful album of the group&#x27;s career; reaching double platinum status in the United States. It also produced several hits, including the top ten pop hits: &quot;Hit Me Off&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Still in Love with You.&quot; However, the ensuing 1997 Home Again Tour would prove disastrous for the group. Despite not having toured together in close to a decade (and over ten years for Brown), old rivalries and struggles for on stage dominance resurfaced as if no time had passed. By the middle leg of the tour, one evening at a concert in Las Cruces, New Mexico as Brown was extending his solo set, DeVoe attempted to pull Brown off the stage. Brown responded by dropping his microphone and a fist fight between the two ensued. This led to both members&#x27; security guards confronting each other, gun play was brought in, and the concert was halted. Bivins and Brown left the tour early, while DeVoe, Bell, Gill, and Tresvant finished out the rest of the tour as a quartet. Brown later admitted during an interview that he was intoxicated during the tour. Each of the group members again went their separate ways, this time on more hostile terms than ever; resulting in an indefinite hiatus that appeared to be the swan song for New Edition.

Also in 1996, the three solo members of New Edition (Brown, Gill and Tresvant) joined Monica and Faith Evans to collaborate with Brown&#x27;s then-wife Whitney Houston on a recording of the gospel standard &quot;Somebody Bigger Than You and I&quot; that appeared on the soundtrack to Houston&#x27;s movie &quot;The Preacher&#x27;s Wife&quot;. They had also made an appearance on &quot;Family Matters&quot; season 8 episode 9 titled &quot;Home Again.&quot;

The following year, Gill formed the R&amp;B supergroup LSG, along with Gerald Levert and Keith Sweat, to release the album &quot;Levert.Sweat.Gill&quot;, which had the hit single &quot;My Body&quot;.

===20022004: Return to the spotlight and New Edition under Bad Boy===
After their second wave of solo pursuits proved less than successful, New Edition reunited once more as a five-piece without Brown and began touring clubs, casinos, and small arenas in 2002; including appearing on &quot;The Tom Joyner Sky Show&quot;. After having caught the attention of rapper/producer Sean Combs, who was present at one of their shows, he signed the group to his Bad Boy Records label, after their long-term contract with MCA Records finally ended.

In the fall of 2004, New Edition&#x27;s seventh studio album and Bad Boy debut, &quot;One Love&quot;, was released. Though the album debuted at number twelve on the Billboard 200, it had a steady descent from the chart. The lead-off single, &quot;Hot 2Nite&quot;, underperformed; peaking at number thirty-five and number eighty-seven on the R&amp;B and Pop singles charts, respectively. During production of the album, the group disagreed with Combs on its creative direction. In an interview, Bell revealed that Combs&#x27; had refused to pay New Edition&#x27;s long time producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis for a track that the group wanted on the album. Reportedly, Combs told the group they were over budget, despite their having used many of Bad Boy&#x27;s in-house team of writers and producers on the album. Ultimately, the group asked to be released from their Bad Boy contract. Despite the messy divorce with Bad Boy, New Edition soldiered on and continued to tour.

===2005present===
In 2005, New Edition appeared on an episode of the UPN reality competition series &quot;R U the Girl&quot; as part of an elimination challenge, assisting the remaining TLC members Tionne &quot;T-Boz&quot; Watkins and Rozonda &quot;Chilli&quot; Thomas in judging the show&#x27;s remaining finalists as they put together group performances opening up for a New Edition live concert. During the making of the episode, Thomas and Watkins discussed with New Edition how Bivins had inspired late member Lisa Lopes&#x27; nickname &quot;Left Eye&quot; in TLC&#x27;s early beginnings. In the fall of 2005, New Edition performed a medley of hits at BET&#x27;s 25th Anniversary Special. During their set, they brought Brown out onstage for an impromptu rendition of their 1985 hit &quot;Mr. Telephone Man&quot;. Brown also performed a rendition of &quot;My Prerogative&quot; with DeVoe and Tresvant as dancers. It was later announced on BET and &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; that Brown had reconciled with &quot;&#x27;New Edition&quot; and planned to rejoin the group for its future concert dates and studio albums.

On August 26, 2006, New Edition filmed a concert at the University of South Carolina&#x27;s Koger Center in Columbia set for a future DVD release, the concert was billed as &quot;Spend the Night with New Edition&quot;, a BET special presented by Lincoln with whom the group has advertised. Brown also made an appearance at the show.

In 2008, the group, minus Brown, recorded a new song with New Kids on the Block called &quot;Full Service&quot; for their latest album, &quot;The Block&quot;. Meanwhile, Brown, Tresvant and Gill formed a new side group called Heads of State, which performed at their 2 year 2 month tour called the Summit Tour which was held from November 2008 to January 2011. According to Gill, their group name was inspired by the original name for The Rat Pack, called &quot;The Summit&quot; or &quot;The Heads of State&quot;.

On June 28, 2009, the group performed a medley of Jackson 5 hits in tribute to Michael Jackson on the BET Awards. Led by Tresvant, Brown and Bell, New Edition sang and danced through classics such as &quot;I Want You Back&quot;, &quot;ABC&quot; and &quot;The Love You Save&quot;. Later that year, Bell and Gill joined New Kids on the Block onstage at a House of Blues benefit show for Toys for Tots in Boston, performing &quot;Full Service&quot; and &quot;This One&#x27;s for the Children&quot;.

Gill later confirmed that New Edition had signed with manager Irving Azoff, that they are currently signed with Geffen Records (which absorbed the group&#x27;s old label, MCA, and controls the group&#x27;s back catalog) and was slating to release a comeback album.

On July 3, 2011, in New Orleans, Louisiana, all six members of New Edition reunited at the Essence Music Festival to kick off and celebrate their 30th anniversary tour. &quot;This is just the beginning. We&#x27;re preparing for a world tour and many other exciting things that we&#x27;ll be announcing soon. The next chapter of New Edition is going to be an incredible celebration to thank our fans for all of their support over the last 30 years,&quot; said Bell speaking on behalf of the group.

In February 2012, Brown missed a handful of dates due to the death of ex-wife Whitney Houston. On March 9 and 11, 2012, Brown and Bell Biv DeVoe made their African debut by performing in Nigeria. From late 2011 to early 2012, New Edition went on a tour called #AllSix across the United States.

In late 2012, New Edition received the Lifetime Achievement Award during the Soul Train Awards ceremony. All six members appeared together onstage that evening.

In August 2015, BET announced a three-episode miniseries about the group would be made for release in January 2017. All six members were co-producers of &quot;The New Edition Story&quot;. Jesse Collins Entertainment was the executive producer of the original miniseries, which was BET&#x27;s first scripted music-focused miniseries. The group&#x27;s original choreographer and longtime manager Brooke Payne also served as a co-producer. On January 24–26, 2017, BET aired the biopic miniseries &quot;The New Edition Story&quot; which chronicles the band members life from their childhood in Boston into Hollywood fame as adults. It was directed by Chris Robinson and executive produced by Jessie Collins. The group served as co-producers. The miniseries brought in 28.4 million viewers to BET, through the initial run and subsequent encores over the week of the premiere.

In July 2021, New Edition signed with Creative Artists Agency and announced a Las Vegas Residency and an upcoming arena tour.

New Edition performed a medley of their hits alongside New Kids on the Block at the 2021 American Music Awards, marking their first performance at the award show since 1997.

In December 2021, New Edition announced The Culture Tour, presented by the Black Promoters Collective. The 30-city tour began in Columbus, Georgia on Feb. 16, 2022, and ended in Miami, Florida, on April 10, 2022.

In December 2022, New Edition announced that they would keep doing tours for the year of 2023. It was named The Legacy Tour and New Edition will be touring 31 cities across the United States. The tour will also have opening acts such as Keith Sweat, Tank, and the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop group, Guy. New Edition&#x27;s first concert will begin in Columbia, South Carolina, on March 9, 2023.

On November 6, 2023, New Edition announced a Vegas residency at the Encore at Wynn Las Vegas in early 2024, which will start on February 28 through March 9

<text>Gregory Thaumaturgus or Gregory the Miracle-Worker (, &quot;Grēgórios ho Thaumatourgós&quot;; ;  213 – 270), also known as Gregory of Neocaesarea, was a Christian bishop of the 3rd century. He has been canonized as a saint in the Catholic and Orthodox Churches.

==Biography==
Gregory was born around AD 213 to a wealthy pagan family in Neocaesarea (modern Niksar, then the capital of the area of Pontus in Asia Minor). Little is known of his pastoral work, and his surviving theological writings are in an incomplete state. This lack of knowledge partially obscures his personality, despite his historical importance, and his immemorial title Thaumaturgus, &quot;the wonder-worker&quot; in Latinized Greek, casts an air of legend about him. Nevertheless, the lives of few bishops of the third century are so well authenticated; the historical references to him permit a fairly detailed reconstruction of his work.

Originally he was known as Theodore (&quot;gift of God&quot;), not an exclusively Christian name. He was introduced to the Christian religion at the age of fourteen, after the death of his father. He had a brother Athenodorus, and on the advice of one of their tutors, the young men were eager to study at the Berytus in Beirut, then one of the four or five famous schools in the Hellenic world. At this time, their brother-in-law was appointed &quot;assessor&quot; (legal counsel) to the Roman Governor of Palestine; the youths had therefore an occasion to act as an escort to their sister as far as Caesarea in Palestine. On arrival in that town they learned that the celebrated scholar Origen, head of the Catechetical School of Alexandria, resided there. Curiosity led them to hear and converse with the master. Soon both youths forgot all about Beirut and Roman law, and gave themselves up to the great Christian teacher, who gradually won them over to Christianity.

In his panegyric on Origen, Gregory describes the method employed by that master to win the confidence and esteem of those he wished to convert; how he mingled a persuasive candour with outbursts of temper and theological argument put cleverly at once and unexpectedly. Persuasive skill rather than bare reasoning, and evident sincerity and an ardent conviction were the means Origen used to make converts. Gregory took up at first the study of philosophy; theology was afterwards added, but his mind remained always inclined to philosophical study, so much so indeed that in his youth he cherished strongly the hope of demonstrating that the Christian religion was the only true and good philosophy. For seven years he underwent the mental and moral discipline of Origen (231 to 238 or 239). There is no reason to believe that his studies were interrupted by the persecutions of Maximinus of Thrace; his alleged journey to Alexandria, at this time, may therefore be considered at least doubtful, and probably never occurred.

Before leaving Palestine, Gregory delivered in presence of Origen a public farewell oration in which he returned thanks to the illustrious master he was leaving. This oration is valuable from many points of view. As a rhetorical exercise it exhibits the excellent training given by Origen, and his skill in developing literary taste and the amount of adulation then permissible towards a living person in an assembly composed mostly of Christians, and Christian in temper. It contains, moreover, much useful information concerning the youth of Gregory and his master&#x27;s method of teaching. A letter of Origen refers to the departure of the two brothers, but it is not easy to determine whether it was written before or after the delivery of this oration. In it Origen exhorts his pupils to bring the intellectual treasures of the Greeks to the service of Christian philosophy, and thus imitate the Jews who employed the golden vessels of the Egyptians to adorn the Holy of Holies.

Gregory returned to Pontus with the intention of practising law. His plan, however, was again laid aside, for he was soon consecrated bishop of his native Neocaesarea by Phoedimus, Bishop of Amasea and metropolitan of Pontus. This fact illustrates in an interesting way the growth of the hierarchy in the primitive Church; the Christian community at Caesarea was very small, being only seventeen souls, and yet it was given a bishop. Ancient canonical documents indicate that it was possible for a community of even ten Christians to have their own bishop. When Gregory was consecrated he was forty years old, and he ruled his diocese for thirty years.

Nothing definite is known about his methods, but he must have shown much zeal in increasing the little flock with which he began his episcopal administration. He was wise, and people came to him for counsel. An ancient source attests to his missionary zeal by recording a curious coincidence: Gregory began with only seventeen Christians, but at his death there remained only seventeen pagans in the whole town of Caesarea. Presumably the many miracles which won for him the title of Thaumaturgus were performed during these years.

==Historicity of life==
Sources on the life, teaching, and actions of Gregory Thaumaturgus are all more or less open to criticism. Besides the details given by Gregory himself, there are four other sources of information, according to Kötschau all derived from oral tradition; indeed, the differences between them force the conclusion that they cannot all be derived from one common written source. They are: 
*&quot;Life and Panegyric of Gregory&quot; by St. Gregory of Nyssa (P.G., XLVI, col. 893 sqq.);
*&quot;Historia Miraculorum&quot;, by Rufinus;
*an account in Syriac of the great actions of Blessed Gregory (sixth-century manuscript);
*St. Basil, &quot;De Spiritu Sancto&quot;.

Drawing on family traditions and a knowledge of the neighbourhood, the account by Gregory of Nyssa is more reliably historical than other known versions of the Thaumaturge&#x27;s life. By the time of Rufinus (ca. 400), the original story was becoming confused; the Syriac account is at times obscure and contradictory. Even the life by Gregory of Nyssa exhibits a legendary element, though the facts were supplied to the writer by his grandmother, St. Macrina the Elder. He relates that before his episcopal consecration Gregory retired from Neocaesarea into a solitude, and was favoured by an apparition of the Blessed Virgin and John the Apostle, and that the latter dictated to him a creed or formula of Christian faith, of which the autograph existed at Neocaesarea when the biography was being written. The creed itself is important for the history of Christian doctrine.

Gregory of Nyssa describes at length the miracles that gained for the Bishop of Caesarea the title of Thaumaturgus. It is clear that Gregory&#x27;s influence must have been considerable, and his miraculous power undoubted. It might have been expected that Gregory&#x27;s name would appear among those who took part in the First Council of Antioch against Paul of Samosata; probably he took part also in the second council held there against the same heresiarch, for the letter of that council is signed by a bishop named Theodore, which had been originally Gregory&#x27;s name. To attract the people to the festivals in honour of the martyrs, Gregory organized profane amusements that might appeal to pagans, who were accustomed to religious ceremonies that combined solemnity with pleasure and merrymaking.

==Writings of Gregory ==
===Oratio Panegyrica===
The &quot;Oratio Panegyrica&quot; in honour of Origen describes in detail that master&#x27;s pedagogical methods. Its literary value consists less in its style than in its novelty: it is the first attempt at biography in Christian literature. This youthful work is full of enthusiasm and genuine talent; moreover, it proves how fully Origen had won the admiration of his pupils, and how the training Gregory received influenced the remainder of a long and well spent life.

Gregory tells us in this work (xiii) that under Origen he read the works of many philosophers, without restriction as to school, except that of the atheists. From this reading of the old philosophers he learned to insist frequently on the unity of God; and his long experience of pagan or crudely Christian populations taught him how necessary this was. Traces of this insistence are to be met with in the Tractatus ad Theopompum, concerning the passability and impassibility of God; this work seems to belong to Gregory, though in its general arrangement it reminds us of Methodius.

A similar trait was probably characteristic of the lost &quot;Dialogus cum Aeliano&quot; (Pros Ailianon Dialexis), which we learn of through St. Basil, who frequently attests the orthodoxy of the Thaumaturgus (Ep. xxviii, 1, 2; cciv, 2; ccvii, 4) and even defends him against the Sabellians, who claimed him for their teaching and quoted as his formula: (that the Father and the Son were two in intelligence, but one in substance) from the aforesaid Dialogus cum Aeliano. St. Basil replied that Gregory was arguing against a pagan, and used the words , i.e. in the heat of combat, not in calm exposition; in this case he was insisting, and rightly, on the Divine unity. He added, moreover, that a like explanation must be given to the words (created, made) when applied to the Son, reference being to Christ Incarnate. Basil added that the text of the work was corrupt.

===Epistola Canonica===
The &quot;Epistola Canonica&quot; (Ἐπιστολὴ κανονική) (Routh, &quot;Reliquiae Sacrae&quot;, III, 251–83) is valuable to both historians and canonists as evidence of the organization of the Church of Caesarea and the other Churches of Pontus under Gregory&#x27;s influence, at a time when the invading Goths had begun to aggravate a situation made difficult enough by the imperial persecutions. We learn from this work how absorbing the episcopal charge was for a man of conscience and a strict sense of duty. Moreover, it helps us to understand how a man so well equipped mentally, and with the literary gifts of Gregory, has not left a greater number of works.

===Exposition of the Faith===
The &quot;Ἔκθεσις τῆς πίστεως&quot; (&quot;Exposition of the Faith&quot;) is in its kind a theological document not less precious than the foregoing. It makes clear Gregory&#x27;s orthodoxy regarding the Trinity. Its authenticity and date seem settled definitively, between 260 and 270. Caspari has shown that this confession of faith is a development of the premises laid down by Origen. Its conclusion leaves no room for doubt, &quot;There is therefore nothing created, nothing greater or less (literally, nothing subject) in the Trinity (oute oun ktiston ti, he doulon en te triadi), nothing superadded, as though it had not existed before, but never been without the Son, nor the Son without the Spirit; and this same Trinity is immutable and unalterable forever&quot;. Such a formula, stating clearly the distinction between the Persons in the Trinity, and emphasizing the eternity, equality, immortality, and perfection, not only of the Father, but of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, proclaims a marked advance on the theories of Origen.

===Epistola ad Philagrium===
The &quot;Epistola ad Philagrium&quot; has reached us in a Syriac version. It treats of the Consubstantiality of the Son and has also been attributed to Gregory of Nazianzus (Ep. ccxliii; formerly Orat. xiv); Tillemont and the Benedictines, however, deny this because it offers no expression suggestive of the Arian controversy. Draeseke, nevertheless, calls attention to numerous views and expressions in this treatise that recall the writings of Gregory of Nazianzus.

===Other attributed works===
A &quot;Metaphrasis eis ton Ekklesiasten tou Solomontos&quot;, or paraphrase of Ecclesiastes, is attributed to him by some manuscripts; others ascribe it to Gregory of Nazianzus; St. Jerome (De vir. illust., chapter 65, and Com. in eccles., iv) ascribes it to our Gregory.

The brief Treatise on the Soul addressed to one Tatian, in favour of which may be cited the testimony of Nicholas of Methone (probably from Procopius of Gaza), is now claimed for Gregory.

The or Twelve Chapters on Faith do not seem to be the work of Gregory. According to Caspari, the &quot;Kata meros pistis&quot; or brief exposition of doctrine concerning the Trinity and the Incarnation, attributed to Gregory, was composed by Apollinaris of Laodicea about 380, and circulated by his followers as a work of Gregory (Otto Bardenhewer).

Finally, the Greek, Syriac, and Armenian Catenæ contain fragments attributed more or less correctly to Gregory. The fragments of the De Resurrectione belong rather to Pamphilus&#x27; &quot;Apologia&quot; for Origen.

== Patronage ==
In medieval Bosnia, &quot;Sveti Grgur&quot;, or Saint Gregory the Miracle-Worker, spread through the rise of the new territorial church, the schismatic Bosnian Church, after the Catholic episcopal see had to move out from Bosnia to Đakovo, in the first half of the 13th century. This prompted Bosnians to search for a new confessional identity, so in a fully autonomous act, unrecognized by papacy at the time, Bosnian political and ecclesiastical hierarchy turned the saint, also known for his state-building role, into both the ruling Kotromanić dynasty and the state patron of the Bosnian Kingdom. Patronage of Saint Gregory the Miracle-Worker will eventually get its recognition by Pope Pius II, in late 1461. Meanwhile, the cult of St. Gregory, maintained by the Bosnian Church, will see another manifestation in Gregory of Nazianzus in the first half of the 15th century, which will change to Saint Gregory the Great with King Thomas&#x27; conversion to Catholicism in late 1440s early 1450s. St. Gregory has been the patron saint of Bosnia and Herzegovina from the medieval times until 26 August 1752, when he was replaced by St. Elijah, and confirmed by papacy, at the request of a Bosnian Franciscan friar, Bishop Pavao Dragičević. The reasons for the replacement are unclear. It has been suggested that Elijah was chosen because of his importance to all three main religious groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina—Catholics, Muslims and Orthodox Christians. Pope Benedict XIV is said to have approved Bishop Dragičević&#x27;s request with the remark that &quot;a wild nation deserved a wild patron&quot;.

<doc id="682290" wikidata="Q242903" url="?curid=682290" title="Lynda Carter">
<text>Lynda Jean Cordova Carter (born July 24, 1951) is an American actress, singer, and beauty pageant contestant, best known for her portrayal of Wonder Woman in the television series &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, aired on ABC and later on CBS from 1975 to 1979. Before her acting career, she was crowned Miss World USA in 1972 and finished in the top 15 at the Miss World 1972 pageant.

Carter has appeared in a wide range of films and television series. She appeared in films such as &quot;Super Troopers&quot; (2001), and &quot;Sky High&quot; (2005), &quot;Super Troopers 2&quot; (2018), and &quot;Wonder Woman 1984&quot; (2020), where she made an uncredited cameo as Asteria. She also had a recurring role as U.S. President Olivia Marsdin on the series &quot;Supergirl&quot; (2016–2018). Additionally, she has participated in various television specials and series, including &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; (2013), and &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; (1980).

Carter has received several honors throughout her career . In 2014, she was awarded a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars. In 2016, she received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Gracie Awards. Carter was also honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2018. In 2022, she was recognized with the Sor Juana Legacy Award by the National Museum of Mexican Art for her contributions to the arts, and later that year, she was inducted into the California Hall of Fame.

== Early life ==
Carter was born in Phoenix, Arizona, the daughter of Juana (&quot;née&quot; Córdova) and Colby Carter. Her father is of English and Irish ancestry, and her mother, whose family hailed from Chihuahua, Mexico, is of Spanish and French descent. She has one brother, Vincent, and one sister, Pamela.
Carter made her public television debut on &quot;Lew King&#x27;s Talent Show&quot; at age 5. During high school, Carter performed in a band called Just Us. The band included a marimba, a conga drum, an acoustic guitar, and a stand-up bass which was played by another girl in the group. At age 15, Carter began singing in the local pizza parlor to earn extra money. When she was 16, she joined two of her cousins in another band called The Relatives. Actor Gary Burghoff was the drummer for the band. The group opened at the Sahara Hotel and Casino lounge in Las Vegas for three months; because Carter was under 21 she had to enter through the kitchen.

In 1970, Carter successfully auditioned for and then sang on tour with The Garfin Gathering and bandleader Howard (Speedy) Garfin. Their first performance together was at the Holiday Inn Chinatown, a San Francisco hotel so new that it had no completed sidewalk entrance. Consequently, they played mostly to the hotel staff and hotel guests who parked their cars in the underground garage. The Garfin Gathering toured the Nevada &quot;Silver Circuit&quot;, playing shows in many of the state&#x27;s casino lounges between Lake Tahoe, Carson City, Reno, and Las Vegas. In 1972, Carter decided to leave the Garfin Gathering to pursue an acting career, returning to Arizona.

== Career ==

In 1972, Carter won a local Arizona beauty contest and gained national attention in the United States by winning Miss World USA 1972, representing Arizona. In the international Miss World 1972 pageant, representing the United States she reached the Top 15. She took acting classes at several New York acting schools during the early 1970s. One of her acting partners during this time was future CBS president Les Moonves. Carter made her first acting appearance in &quot;Roots of Anger&quot;, an episode of the 1974 police drama &quot;Nakia&quot;. She began making appearances on such TV shows as &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot; and &quot;Cos&quot;, as well as appearances in several &quot;B&quot; movies.

=== &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; ===
Wonder Woman, the fictional superhero character, was created by the American psychologist and writer William Moulton Marston and artist Harry G. Peter in 1941 for DC Comics. Conceived in the wake of the popularity of Superman, Marston designed his creation as counter-programming to the Man of Steel. The Diana Prince/Wonder Woman character is also called the Amazing Amazon, the Spirit of Truth, Themyscira&#x27;s Champion, and the Goddess of Love and War. Wonder Woman was an instant hit with readers and became the most prominent DC comic book female superhero.

Carter&#x27;s acting career took off when she landed the starring role on &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; in 1975, as the title character and her secret identity, Diana Prince. The savings she had set aside from her days of touring on the road with her band to pursue acting in Los Angeles were almost exhausted. Carter has publicly stated that, on the day she got the part, she had $25 in the bank. She was close to returning to Arizona when her manager informed her that Joanna Cassidy had lost the role and Carter had the part of Wonder Woman. Carter&#x27;s earnest performance greatly endeared her to both fans and critics. As a result, she continues to be closely identified with Wonder Woman.

The &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; series lasted for three seasons, from 1975 to 1979. It first aired on ABC, and later on CBS. Carter&#x27;s performance, rooted in the character&#x27;s inherent goodness combined with a comic-accurate costume and a catchy theme song, made for a depiction that was considered iconic. After the show ended, Carter told &quot;Us&quot; that &quot;I never meant to be a sexual object for anyone but my husband. I never thought a picture of my body would be tacked up in men&#x27;s bathrooms. I hate men looking at me and thinking what they think. And I know what they think. They write and tell me.&quot; The 2018 journal article &quot;Casting a Wider Lasso: An Analysis of the Cultural Dismissal of Wonder Woman Through Her 1975-1979 Television Series&quot; argued that the show strongly adapted Wonder Woman&#x27;s ideals but &quot;was suppressed, undone, and discredited&quot; by American culture as part of a larger legacy suppressing the character.

In 2017, Carter explained her perspective of portraying the Diana Prince/Wonder Woman character. Carter says she got the role back in 1975 largely because she looked the part, which was both a blessing and—as one of the show&#x27;s producers warned her—a curse, saying that &quot;Oh, women are going to be so jealous of you.&quot; Carter had responded, &quot;Not a chance. They won&#x27;t be, because I am not playing her that way. I want women to want to be me, or be my best friend!&quot;. As Carter describes portraying Wonder Woman, &quot;There is something about the character where in your creative mind for that time in your life where you pretended to be her, or whatever the situation was, that it felt like you could fly&quot;.

In 1985, DC Comics named Carter one of the honorees, in the company&#x27;s 50th anniversary publication &quot;Fifty Who Made DC Great&quot;, for her work on the &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; series.

In 2007, DC Direct released a full-figure statue of Carter as Wonder Woman, limited to 5,000 pieces; it was re-released in 2010. Also in 2010, DC Direct began selling a bust of Carter&#x27;s Wonder Woman to celebrate the 75th anniversary of DC Comics.

During production of the 2017 &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; feature film, director Patty Jenkins approached Carter to appear in a cameo role in the film, as Carter confirmed, &quot;Patty asked me to do a cameo in this. She was in England, and I was doing my concerts,&quot; explaining she had singing engagements that made her unavailable. &quot;At that time we couldn&#x27;t get our timing together. So, this next time, if she writes me a decent part, I might do it.&quot; Carter did make a cameo in the post-credits scene of the sequel film, &quot;Wonder Woman 1984&quot; where she plays Asteria, the &quot;Golden Warrior&quot; of the Amazons.

Carter holds dear the new film and the character introduced more than 75 years ago. &quot;Many actresses or actors, they want to divorce themselves from a role because we are actors, we really aren&#x27;t the people that we play. But I knew very early on that this character is much more than me certainly, and to try to divorce myself from the experiences that other people have of the character is silly,&quot; she said.

=== Music and promotional work ===
While &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; was being produced, Carter was well recognized and in demand for promotional work. In 1978, Carter was voted &quot;The Most Beautiful Woman in the World&quot; by the International Academy of Beauty and the British Press Organization. She had also signed a modelling contract with Maybelline cosmetics in 1977. In 1979, she appeared in a Diet 7Up commercial along with comedian Don Rickles.

Carter was the first woman to provide a voiceover for a movie trailer, as she did for the 1975 film &quot;The Drowning Pool&quot;.

Carter continued to pursue her interest in music. During the late 1970s she recorded the album &quot;Portrait&quot;. Carter is credited in several variety television programs for being a co-writer on several songs and making numerous musical guest appearances. She also sang two of her songs in a 1979 &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; episode, &quot;Amazon Hot Wax&quot;.

In 1977, Carter released a promotional poster through Pro Arts at the suggestion of her then-husband and manager, Ron Samuels. The poster was very successful despite Carter&#x27;s dissatisfaction with it. In 1981 during an interview on the NBC television special &quot;Women Who Rate a 10&quot;, she said:

It&#x27;s uncomfortable because I just simply took a photograph. That&#x27;s all my participation was in my poster that sold over a million copies, was that I took a photograph that I thought was a dumb photograph. My husband said, &quot;Oh, try this thing tied up here, it&#x27;ll look beautiful&quot;. And the photographer said &quot;the back-lighting is really terrific&quot;. So dealing with someone having that picture up in their... bedroom or their... living room or whatever I think would be hard for anyone to deal with.

For &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (1979) she was originally cast in the role of &quot;Playboy&quot; Playmate Bunny, but the filming of her scenes was interrupted by the storm that wrecked the theater set prompting a delay of nearly two months for rebuilding. By the time director Francis Ford Coppola was ready to shoot again, Carter&#x27;s contractual obligations to &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; had forced her back to the States and her scenes were reshot with Colleen Camp. The only evidence remaining of Carter&#x27;s involvement are the &quot;Playboy&quot; centerfolds that were specially shot by the magazine as movie props, and a glimpse of Carter&#x27;s pinup in the &quot;Redux&quot; version.

=== Life after &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;: music, film and television ===
 
After &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; ended, Carter had many opportunities in music, film, and television. In 1980 Carter initially made a guest appearance on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;. In the episode&#x27;s running gag, Kermit the Frog repeatedly reminds the other Muppets that their guest is Carter and not Wonder Woman. This is to no avail as the Muppets ineptly attempt to become superheroes by taking a correspondence course and Miss Piggy portrays &quot;Wonder Pig&quot;, a spoof of Carter&#x27;s television character.

She was quickly given a variety of her own musical TV specials, including &quot;Lynda Carter&#x27;s Special&quot; (1980), &quot;Encore!&quot; (1980), &quot;Celebration&quot; (1981), &quot;Street Life&quot; (1982), and &quot;Body and Soul&quot; (1984). She landed the title role in a biographical film about actress Rita Hayworth (born Margarita Carmen Cansino) titled &quot;Rita Hayworth: The Love Goddess&quot; (1983).

Carter&#x27;s next major role after Wonder Woman was in the crime drama television series &quot;Partners in Crime&quot; with Loni Anderson in 1984. She then portrayed Helen Durant in the 1989 CBS television film &quot;Mike Hammer: Murder Takes All&quot; where she booby-traps Las Vegas entertainer Johnny Roman (Edward Winter), her husband Doctor Carl Durant, and his employee accountant Brad Peters (Jim Carrey) causing their deaths.

Throughout the 1990s, Carter appeared in a string of television movies which resulted in a resurgence in television appearances for her. She appeared in commercials for Lens Express (now 1-800 Contacts). Around that time Carter created her own production company, Potomac Productions. In 1993, Carter expanded her performance resume to include voice-over work as the narrator for the Sandra Brown book &quot;Where There&#x27;s Smoke&quot;.

=== New millennium ===
The new millennium saw Carter continuing to work in various areas. Because of the resyndication of &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; on cable networks like FX and SyFy, Carter participated in two scheduled on-line chat sessions with fans. In 2000, Carter hosted the &quot;I Love 1978&quot; episode of BBC2&#x27;s &quot;I Love the &#x27;70s&quot;. In 2004, she won an award for being the &quot;Superest Superhero&quot; on the &quot;Second Annual TV Land Awards&quot; the same year. When an announcer reported that an invisible plane was double-parked illegally and needed to be moved before it was towed, she performed her spinning transformation once again after 25 years, although a younger actress wore the star-spangled outfit at that moment.

Carter performed in a variety of film roles, making up a majority of her film work in the 2000s. In 2001, she was cast in the independent comedy feature &quot;Super Troopers&quot;, as Vermont Governor Jessman. The writers and stars of the film, the comedy troupe Broken Lizard along with the director Jay Chandrasekhar had specifically sought Carter for the role. Inspired by the character detour from her usual roles, she agreed to play a washed-up, former beauty queen in &quot;The Creature of the Sunny Side Up Trailer Park&quot; (2004) which was directed by Christopher Coppola.

Carter made her first appearance in a major feature film in a number of years in the big-screen remake of &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; (2005), also directed by Chandrasekhar. She appeared in Disney&#x27;s action comedy film &quot;Sky High&quot; (2005) as Principal Powers, the headmistress of a school for superheroes. The script allowed Carter to poke fun at her most famous character when she states: &quot;I can&#x27;t do anything more to help you. I&#x27;m not Wonder Woman, y&#x27;know.&quot; In 2006, she guest-starred in the made-for-cable vampire film &quot;Slayer&quot;. The following year Carter returned to the DC Comics&#x27; television world in the &quot;Smallville&quot; episode &quot;Progeny&quot; (2007), playing Chloe Sullivan&#x27;s Kryptonite-empowered mother.

Carter expanded her voice-over work to include video games, performing voices for the Nord and Orsimer (Orc) females in two computer games of &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; series beginning in 2002, and including &quot;The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind&quot;, &quot;The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion&quot;, and &quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim&quot;, as well as playing a singer in a subway-converted bar in 2015&#x27;s &quot;Fallout 4&quot;. These games were developed by Bethesda Softworks; her husband, businessman Robert A. Altman was chairman and CEO of Bethesda&#x27;s parent company, ZeniMax Media.

Carter decided to do a variety of theater projects. From September to November 2005, Carter played &quot;Mama Morton&quot; in the West End London production of &quot;Chicago.&quot; In 2006, her rendition of &quot;When You&#x27;re Good to Mama&quot; was officially released on the &quot;Chicago: 10th Anniversary Edition&quot; CD box set. In May 2007, Carter began touring the U.S. with her one-woman musical cabaret show, &quot;An Evening with Lynda Carter&quot;. She played engagements at such venues as Feinstein&#x27;s at Loews Regency in New York, Jazz at Lincoln Center, the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., the Razz Room in San Francisco, and the Catalina Jazz Club in Los Angeles. In June 2009, her second album, &quot;At Last&quot; was released and reached No. 10 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Jazz Albums Chart. In June 2011, Carter released her third album, &quot;Crazy Little Things&quot; which she describes as a delightful mix of standards, country, and pop tunes. In 2015, Carter wrote and recorded five original songs for the video game &quot;Fallout 4&quot; in which she herself stars. An EP of the songs from the game&#x27;s soundtrack was released on iTunes on November 6, 2015. The song &quot;Good Neighbor&quot; from the EP was nominated by NAVGTR for best song under the category of Song, Original or Adapted. In 2018, Carter released her fourth album titled &quot;Red, Rock n&#x27; Blues&quot; with her All-Star Band which featured two vocals with her daughter, Jessica Altman. She continues to perform her concerts nationally at venues including The Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., Catalina Jazz Club in Hollywood, Feinstein&#x27;s at the Nikko in San Francisco, the Franklin Theater in Nashville, and Jazz at Lincoln Center in NYC. Carter performs with her All-Star Band and presents her special guest, Jessica Altman. Jessica released her own EP &quot;No Rules&quot; in early 2020.

=== Recent work ===
Carter is among the interview subjects in &quot;Superheroes: A Never-Ending Battle&quot;, a three-hour documentary narrated by Liev Schreiber that premiered on PBS in October 2013.

Carter, fellow &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; actress Gal Gadot, DC Entertainment President Diane Nelson, &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; director Patty Jenkins, and U.N. Under-Secretary General Cristina Gallach appeared at the United Nations on October 21, 2016, the 75th anniversary of the first appearance of Wonder Woman to mark the character&#x27;s designation by the United Nations as its &quot;Honorary Ambassador for the Empowerment of Women and Girls&quot;. The gesture was intended to raise awareness of UN Sustainable Development Goal No. 5, which seeks to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls by 2030. However the decision was met with protests from UN staff members who stated in their petition to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that the character is &quot;not culturally encompassing or sensitive&quot;, and served to objectify women. As a result the character was stripped of the designation and the project ended on December 16.

In 2017, Carter rejoined the Warner Bros./DC Comics film and television family on the second season of The CW&#x27;s &quot;Supergirl&quot; television series in the role of President Olivia Marsdin. Executive producer Andrew Kreisberg described Carter&#x27;s presence on the show as &quot;a big stand to necessitate &quot;Supergirl&quot; (Melissa Benoist) and the DEO protecting her&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Lynda Carter and the French singer Michel Polnareff had a romantic relationship in 1973 before she played the role of Wonder Woman.

Carter has been married twice. Her first marriage was to her former talent agent, Ron Samuels, from 1977 to 1982, a period in which she has publicly stated that she was very unhappy. On January 29, 1984, she married Washington, D.C., attorney Robert A. Altman, law partner of Clark Clifford and later co-founder CEO of ZeniMax Media. She left Hollywood in 1985 to join her husband in Washington, D.C., for a few years. Carter and her husband have two children: James Altman (born January 14, 1988) and Jessica Carter Altman (born October 7, 1990). The couple lived in a Potomac, Maryland, home they built in 1987, shortly before the birth of their son. The 20,000-square-foot Georgian-style mansion was profiled in the premiere issue of &quot;Closer&quot; magazine in November 2013, as well as on HGTV.

In 1993, after a lengthy and highly publicized jury trial stemming from Altman&#x27;s involvement with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and its secret acquisition of First American Bankshares Inc., he was acquitted. Carter was seen on the TV news with her arm around him, declaring, &quot;Not guilty! Not guilty!&quot; to the gathered reporters. On February 3, 2021, Altman died at a hospital in Baltimore owing to a battle with myelofibrosis, a rare form of leukemia. He was 73.

Carter is a fan of ice hockey, and the Washington Capitals are her favorite team.

Carter is a Democrat who campaigned for Hillary Clinton during the 2016 United States presidential election. She also endorsed Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election and Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

In 2003, Carter revealed that her mother had suffered from irritable bowel syndrome for over 30 years, leading to Carter touring the country as an advocate and spokeswoman. Carter is also a staunch advocate and supporter of Susan G. Komen for the Cure, abortion rights, and legal equality for LGBT people. She was the Grand Marshal for the 2011 Phoenix Pride Parade, the 2011 New York Pride Parades, and the 2013 Capital Pride Parade in Washington, D.C. In 2010 she served as Grand Marshall for the Washington, D.C., AIDS Walk.

===Health and alcohol problems===
In a June 4, 2008, interview with &quot;People&quot; magazine, Carter stated that she had in the past entered a rehabilitation clinic for treatment of alcoholism and that she had been sober for nearly 10 years. When she was asked what the recovery process had taught her, Carter explained that the best measure of a human being is &quot;how we treat the people who love us, and the people that we love&quot;.

Carter states that she is committed to her recovery from alcoholism and addiction. She credits her husband&#x27;s intervention for her ultimate acceptance of personal powerlessness over alcoholism, stating in a 2016 Council on Recovery interview that, &quot;After 18 years of recovery, I live every day with immense gratitude. I am forever thankful for my family and friends who stood by me and encouraged me… and for those who helped me heal.&quot; 

The following is press material produced by Carter and her staff regarding her experience of alcoholism:

“Through her inspiring story, Carter shares the power and grace of vulnerability, faith, and surrender that she believes nourish lasting recovery. Celebrating over 20 years of sobriety, Carter continues to guest speak at various health and well-being events. Her recovery story and its message of hope is directed to every member of the family. It is a strong reminder that family support can make a huge difference to a recovering addict or alcoholic.”

== Honors ==
In 1985, DC Comics named Carter as one of the honorees in the company&#x27;s 50th anniversary publication &quot;Fifty Who Made DC Great&quot; for her work on the Wonder Woman series.

In 2014, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to Carter&#x27;s career. Carter&#x27;s dedication is the 369th honoree on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars.

In 2016, Carter received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Gracie Awards. The Gracie Awards ceremony is presented by the Alliance for Women in Media Foundation (AWM), since 1975.

On April 3, 2018, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce (HCC) proudly honored Carter with the 2,632nd star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The star is at 6562 Hollywood Boulevard in the television section. HCC President and CEO Leron Gubler unveiled the star with the assistance of guest speakers, director Patty Jenkins and former CBS chairman Leslie Moonves.

On September 17, 2022, the National Museum of Mexican Art in Chicago honored Carter with the Sor Juana Legacy Award for her outstanding contributions to the arts. The Sor Juana Legacy Award recognizes women of Mexican descent for their lifetime achievements.

On December 13, 2022, Carter was inducted into the California Hall of Fame, along with a handful of others.

<doc id="682293" wikidata="Q1389005" url="?curid=682293" title="Joe Higgins (politician)">
<text>Joe Higgins (born 20 May 1949) is an Irish former Socialist Party politician who served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin West constituency from 1997 to 2007 and from 2011 to 2016. He served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Dublin constituency from 2009 to 2011.

==Early life==
One of nine children of a small farming family, Higgins was born in 1949 in Lispole, part of the Dingle Gaeltacht in County Kerry. He went to school in the Dingle Christian Brothers School, and after finishing he enrolled in the priesthood. As part of his training he was sent to a Catholic seminary school in Minnesota, United States in the 1960s.

Higgins became politicised at the time of anti-Vietnam War protests and the civil rights movement. He is a brother of Liam Higgins, who played football with the Kerry GAA senior team in the 1960s and 1970s.

Higgins is bilingual in English and Irish.

==Political career==
===Early activism===
Higgins returned to Ireland and attended University College Dublin, studying English and French. For several years he was a teacher in several Dublin inner city schools. While at university he joined the Labour Party and became active in the Militant Tendency, an entryist Trotskyist group that operated within the Labour Party. Throughout his time in the Labour Party he was a strong opponent of coalition politics, along with TDs Emmet Stagg and Michael D. Higgins. He was elected to the Administrative Council of the Labour Party by the membership in the 1980s. In 1989, Higgins was expelled alongside 13 other members of Militant Tendency by party leader Dick Spring. The group eventually left the party and formed Militant Labour, which became the Socialist Party in 1996.

Higgins spent over half his salary on the Socialist Party and causes he supported. He was elected to Dublin County Council in 1991 for the Mulhuddart electoral area, and was until 2003 a member of Fingal County Council. In 1996, he campaigned against local authority water and refuse charges and contested the Dublin West by-election, losing narrowly to Brian Lenihan Jnr.

===Dáil Éireann: 1997–2007===

Higgins was first elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1997 general election, and re-elected at the 2002 general election. He lost his seat at the 2007 general election, but regained it at the 2011 general election. From 2002 to 2007, he was a member of the Technical Group in the Dáil which consisted of various Independent TDs, Sinn Féin and the Green Party grouped together for better speaking time.

In 2003, Higgins accused Taoiseach Bertie Ahern of having &quot;blood on his hands&quot; in relation to the use of Shannon Airport by American troops. He spoke out against the Iraq War while a TD, and addressed the Dublin leg of the 20 March 2003 International Day of Action.

In April 2003, Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform Michael McDowell addressed Higgins during a Dáil debate, saying &quot;I do not take lectures on democracy from a Trotskyite communist like Deputy Joe Higgins.&quot;

On 19 September 2003, Higgins was sentenced to one month in Mountjoy Prison as a result of his protest against the non-collection of refuse in his constituency during the Anti-Bin Tax Campaign. He was also prominent in the successful 2005 campaign to bring Nigerian school student Olukunle Eluhanla back to Ireland after he had been deported. Higgins remains an opponent of the deportation policy.

When President Mary McAleese telephoned Higgins in 2004 to inform him of her decision to seek re-election, he told her that her office was &quot;superfluous and should be abolished&quot;. McAleese was reported to have been left speechless.

At the 2004 European Parliament election, Higgins received 23,200 (5.5%) votes in the Dublin constituency, double his 1999 result, but did not win a seat.

Higgins used his platform in the Dáil to raise the issue of exploitation of migrant and guest workers in Ireland. He and others claimed that many companies were paying migrants below the minimum wage and, in some cases, not paying overtime rates. In March 2005, Higgins and a delegation of Turkish ex-employees of GAMA Endustri, a Turkish construction firm working in Ireland, travelled to Amsterdam, Netherlands, where they discovered that GAMA had been secreting up to €30 million in workers&#x27; wages without their knowledge. He expressed opposition in the Dáil to the jailing of the Rossport Five in July 2005. He raised the outsourcing of jobs by Irish Ferries in the Dáil in November 2005, requesting new legislation to regulate what he described as &quot;these modern slavers&quot;.

In May 2006, Higgins boycotted an address to the Dáil by Australian Prime Minister John Howard owing to Australia&#x27;s role in the Iraq War, the country&#x27;s &quot;criminal&quot; legislation on worker&#x27;s rights, and its theft of oil and gas from the poor people of East Timor, describing it as &quot;reminiscent of Margaret Thatcher&quot;.

In October 2006, Higgins requested the suspension of normal business in the Dáil after it emerged that Ryanair had upped its share in Aer Lingus overnight, amid concerns for workers&#x27; rights and passenger welfare.

In 2008, Higgins was a political opponent of the Irish government&#x27;s first Treaty of Lisbon referendum. He described the success of the &quot;No&quot; campaign as &quot;a huge rebuff to the Irish political establishment&quot;.

===European Parliament: 2009–2011===

Higgins successfully contested the 2009 European Parliament election for the Dublin constituency, beating two incumbents, Mary Lou McDonald of Sinn Féin and Eoin Ryan of Fianna Fáil, for the third and final seat. He was elected on the same day to Fingal County Council for the Castleknock electoral area, topping the poll. As Irish law prohibits politicians having a dual mandate, Higgins vacated this council seat in July 2009 and was replaced by Matt Waine. He was a member of the European United Left–Nordic Green Left (EUL–NGL) group in the European Parliament, the European Parliament&#x27;s Committee on International Trade, and the delegation for relations with the countries of South Asia. He was also a substitute member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the Committee on Petitions and the delegation for relations with the Mercosur countries.

In 2009, Higgins was a political opponent of the Irish government&#x27;s re-run of the Treaty of Lisbon referendum. He said the guarantees did not change the Treaty. Higgins said, &quot;The overall agenda here is quite simply the ruling classes, or the classes of Europe intend to stride on to the world stage as a powerful economic entity. And they want to be as powerful as the US, meaning they want a stronger foreign policy and a military wing to back them up.&quot; He also spoke out against Ireland&#x27;s Catholic bishops, who claimed neither a &quot;Yes&quot; nor a &quot;No&quot; vote would threaten the unborn, saying that EU spending on arms ought to be enough for the bishops to join the &quot;No&quot; campaign.

On 23 November 2010, Higgins walked out of a meeting of Irish MEPs with EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn, after two minutes in Strasbourg, prompting criticism from Fine Gael MEP Gay Mitchell. Higgins said he walked out as information Rehn was giving was to be confidential and that he felt it would have been a betrayal to stay, calling it &quot;unacceptable&quot;.

During a debate at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, Higgins described the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) as &quot;nothing more than another tool to cushion major European banks from the consequences of their reckless speculation on the financial markets&quot;. He claimed the EFSF was a &quot;mechanism to make working class people throughout Europe pay for the crisis of a broken financial system and a crisis-ridden European capitalism&quot;. He accused President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso and President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy of effectively transferring tens of billions of euros of private bad debts &quot;on to the shoulders of the Irish people&quot;. Barroso rejected the claims, instead blaming Irish banks and lax regulation for Ireland&#x27;s problems, saying: &quot;To the distinguished member of this Parliament who comes from Ireland, who asked a question suggesting that the problems of Ireland were created by Europe, let me tell you: the problems of Ireland were created by the irresponsible financial behaviour of some Irish institutions, and by the lack of supervision in the Irish market&quot;.

Paul Murphy replaced Higgins as an MEP when Higgins was re-elected to the Dáil.

===Dáil Éireann: 2011–2016===
Higgins was elected again as TD for Dublin West at the 2011 general election. He won the third seat (of four) with 8,084 first preference votes. In his first speech in the 31st Dáil, he opposed the nomination of Fine Gael&#x27;s Enda Kenny as Taoiseach. Higgins announced that he would &quot;put up a principled opposition to the Fine Gael-Labour coalition which is most likely&quot;, since they are &quot;going to carry on with the same policies as Fianna Fáil, making working-class people pay for the bankers&#x27; bad gambling debts&quot;. He promised to work with the other United Left Alliance TDs &quot;as a coherent, principled opposition&quot;. He suggested the creation of a national exploration company which would allow the state to retain any profits obtained from natural resources.

Ahead of the occasion of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s visit to the Republic of Ireland in May 2011, Higgins asked Enda Kenny in the Dáil if &quot;the might be politely asked to contribute to the cost of her bed &amp; breakfast during her visit to Ireland&quot;, observing that &quot;the Irish people needed the financial help since they could soon be sleeping rough, as the country faced bankruptcy to pay off the debts of German and French banks, which had recklessly gambled and lost in the Irish property bubble&quot;. On 4 May 2011, Enda Kenny was forced to apologise to Higgins in the Dáil after falsely accusing him of being a supporter of Osama bin Laden after Higgins offered criticism of his assassination by the CIA. Higgins had asked the Taoiseach: &quot;Is assassination only justified if the target is a reactionary, anti-democratic, anti-human rights obscurantist like bin Laden?&quot;.

He vowed there would be a nationwide campaign of &quot;people power&quot; against any household and water charges. In September 2011, Higgins committed to facilitating the nomination of Senator David Norris for a place on the ballot paper ahead of the 2011 Irish presidential election, despite multiple controversies enveloping the candidate. On the occasion of the publication of the Keane report on mortgage arrears in October 2011, Higgins criticised Enda Kenny&#x27;s government and said the report was &quot;a banker&#x27;s charter written by bankers&quot;. His description of allowing the banks to solve their own problems as being &quot;like sending a bunch of marauding foxes that had raided a henhouse back to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to their victims&quot; was quoted several times by other commentators in the media. Higgins addressed &quot;The EU in Crisis&quot; public debate, held at the Ireland Institute in Dublin in October 2011. He served as Ruth Coppinger&#x27;s election agent in the 2011 Dublin West by-election, held alongside the presidential election. At her campaign launch Higgins said Taoiseach Enda Kenny was engaging in a &quot;cynical manipulation of the political agenda&quot; by delaying the publication of his government&#x27;s comprehensive spending review until after the elections.

In the Dáil, Higgins accused Tánaiste Eamon Gilmore of doing nothing for the 14 Irish citizens being held &quot;incommunicado&quot; by Israel in November 2011. In December 2011, Higgins described as a disgraceful campaign of intimidation the fines imposed by the government on people who were unable to pay a new household charge brought in as part of the latest austerity budget and said to Enda Kenny that he would be &quot;the new Captain Boycott of austerity in this country&quot;. He asked that Minister for Finance Michael Noonan provide EBS staff with the 13th month end-of-year payment they were being denied.

In September 2012, he publicly disagreed with former Socialist Party colleague Clare Daly, saying it was &quot;unfortunate&quot; that she had resigned from the party, but that it was impossible for Daly under the banner of the Socialist Party to continue to offer political support to Mick Wallace, who was at that time embroiled in scandal.

He announced in April 2014 that he would not contest the next Dáil election. At the time he stated his belief that the &quot;baton of elected representation&quot; should be carried by another generation of Socialist Party politicians — like Ruth Coppinger and Paul Murphy.

<doc id="682294" wikidata="Q17090906" url="?curid=682294" title="Go! (Letters to Cleo album)">
<text>Go! is the third studio album by the alternative rock band Letters to Cleo. It was released in 1997 on Revolution Records. It was their first album without their original drummer, Stacy Jones, who was replaced by Tom Polce.

The album peaked at No. 45 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top Heatseekers chart.

==Production==
The album was produced by Peter Collins. It was recorded at Long View Farm, in North Brookfield, Massachusetts. Greg Hawkes played keyboards on &quot;Anchor&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Trouser Press&quot; called the album &quot;effective and likable,&quot; writing that &quot;Hanley explores the titular theme of dispatching an ex, singing her disillusioned and bitter lyrics ... with conviction and power against loud rock-pop that reaches its apogee in the nearly Breeders-like surge of &#x27;Anchor&#x27;.&quot; The &quot;Orange County Register&quot; considered it &quot;nothing special, each song an imitation of standard alternative music this decade without adding anything new to the mix.&quot;

<doc id="682296" wikidata="Q4821506" url="?curid=682296" title="Augustus Nicholas Burke">
<text>Augustus Joseph Nicholas Burke (28 July 1838 – 1891) was an Irish artist and an Academician of the Royal Hibernian Academy (RHA).

==Early life==
Burke was born into the Galway Burkes of Glinsk and was the sixth son of William Burke of Knocknagur, Tuam, County Galway. He was born at Waterslade House in the town. One of his brothers was Theobald Hubert Burke, 13th Baronet of Glinsk, while another brother was Thomas Henry Burke, Permanent Under Secretary at the Irish Office.

==Career==
He showed an early interest in drawing, displaying a love for depicting the people and land of Connemara. His career in the arts was initiated at the Royal Academy in London. He would exhibit at the Royal Academy and the Royal Hibernian Academy, from 1863 until his death, where he was also Professor of Painting. From 1870 to 1872 he resided in the Netherlands where he illustrated a handful of Dutch scenes. One of the earliest Irish artists to travel to Brittany, Burke exhibited fifteen Breton scenes at the Royal Hibernian Academy between 1876 and 1878. He painted further in his native Ireland, as well as Scotland and England. The 1880s brought Burke to Walberswick in Suffolk to an artist&#x27;s colony created by Philip Wilson Steer. A student of Burke, Walter Osborne, painted with him here.

==Later life==
Augustus, overcome with grief by his brother Thomas&#x27; murder during the Phoenix Park Murders in 1882, left his post at the Royal Hibernian Academy where he was Professor of Painting. He then moved with the remaining members of his family England and then later to Italy.

==Paintings==
Two of his most famous paintings, &quot;Connemara Girl&quot; and &quot;A Connemara Landscape&quot; hang at the National Gallery of Ireland. His work is relatively rare, mainly because the contents of his studio were destroyed during the fire that engulfed the Abbey Street buildings of the RHA in 1916. Furthermore, many of the paintings lay hidden in a cellar for over ninety years until their recent discovery.

<text>Halifax is a federal electoral district in Nova Scotia, Canada. It is one of a handful of ridings which has been represented continuously (albeit with different boundaries and different numbers of members) in the House of Commons since Confederation in 1867.

The riding of Halifax includes the communities of Spryfield, Sambro, Herring Cove, Harrietsfield, Williamswood, Prospect, Purcell&#x27;s Cove, Armdale, Cowie Hill, Fairmount, Kline Heights, and the Halifax Peninsula.

==History==

The electoral district was created at Confederation in 1867. It returned two members until 1968.

The most notable of the riding&#x27;s MPs was Robert Borden, who was Conservative leader from 1901 to 1920, and Prime Minister of Canada from 1911 to 1920. Borden represented the riding from 1896 to 1904 and again from 1909 to 1917. Another notable MP was Robert Stanfield, leader of the Progressive Conservative Party from 1967 to 1976, who represented the riding from 1968 to 1979.

Halifax was represented by the New Democratic Party from 1997 to 2015, with the Liberal Party coming in second in every election from 2000 to 2015. The riding&#x27;s boundaries were re-distributed in 2004. Before that date, it comprised the peninsula of Halifax, the community of Fairview, and part of Clayton Park.

Alexa McDonough stepped down as NDP leader in 2003, but stayed on to represent Halifax in the House of Commons. McDonough ran for re-election against popular city councillor Sheila Fougere in 2004, who came within 1000 votes of beating the incumbent. McDonough pulled ahead based in part on a strong showing in Halifax&#x27;s North End. On 2 June 2008, McDonough announced that she would not seek re-election.

Following the 2012 redistribution, the riding gained a small part of the riding of Halifax West, on the eastern side of Long Lake Provincial Park.

An exception is the five-tone from the north of Bali, which is what as many as seven keys. In four-tone groups, the flute players will occasionally use an implied fifth tone. Additionally, whereas many of the instruments in span multiple octaves of its pentatonic scale, most instruments only contain one octave, although some five-tone ensembles have roughly an octave and a half. The instruments are considerably smaller than those of the .

 is heard in Balinese temples, where it supplies musical accompaniment to temple anniversaries (). It is also characteristic of rituals related to death (), and is therefore connected in Balinese culture to the invisible spiritual realm and transitions from life to death and beyond. Because of their portability, instruments may be carried in processions while a funeral bier is carried from temporary burial in a cemetery to the cremation site. The musicians also often play music to accompany the cremation ceremony. Thus, many Balinese listeners associate music and its scale with strong emotions evoking a combination of sacred sweetness and sadness.

The structure of the music is similar to , although employing a four-tone scale. A pair of metallophones carries the basic melody, which is elaborated by &quot;gangsa&quot;, &quot;reyong&quot;, , flute, and small drums played with mallets. A medium-sized gong, called , is generally used to punctuate a piece&#x27;s major sections.

Most older compositions do not employ the &#x27;s more ostentatious virtuosity and showmanship. Recently, many Balinese composers have created -style works for or have rearranged melodies to fit the ″s more restricted four-tone scale. These new pieces often feature dance, so the is augmented with heavier gongs and larger drums. Additionally, some modern composers have created experimental instrumental pieces for the .

The Thai are typically tuned in the Thai tuning system of seven equidistant steps per octave, and each has three bamboo tubes tuned in three separate octaves rather than two, as is typical in Indonesia.

Formally introduced into Malaysia sometime after the end of the Confrontation, found immediate popularity. They are generally played using a pentatonic scale similar to the Indonesian &quot;slendro&quot;, although in the Philippines, sets also come in the diatonic and minor scales used to perform various Spanish-influenced folk music in addition to native songs in pentatonic.

<text>The Austin-Healey 3000 is a British sports car built from 1959 until 1967. It is the best known of the &quot;big Healey&quot; models. The car&#x27;s bodywork was made by Jensen Motors and the vehicles were assembled at BMC&#x27;s MG Works in Abingdon, alongside the corporation&#x27;s MG models.

During its production life, the car changed from an open sports car, albeit with a child-transporting 2+2 option, to a sports convertible. In 1963, 91.5 percent of all Austin-Healey 3000 cars were exported; mostly to North America. The 3-litre 3000 was a highly successful car, which won its class in many European rallies in its heyday and is still raced in classic car competitions by enthusiasts today.

British Motor Corporation ended manufacture in 1967, filling its place with a car with a new, though similar, engine in a newer monocoque chassis; the MGB variant named the MGC.

==History==
===Mark I===
====BN7, BT7 roadsters====
The Austin-Healey 3000 was announced on 1 July 1959 with a 3-litre BMC C-Series engine to replace the smaller 2.6-litre engine of the 100-6 and disc brakes for its front wheels. The manufacturers claimed it would reach 60 mph in 11 seconds and 100 mph in 31 seconds.

Other changes were minor compared to those between the original 100 and the 100–6. The wheelbase and body were unchanged as were the body-styles, a 2+2 or BT7 and a two-seater BN7.

Weather protection remained minimal, a folding plastic roof on a light demountable frame and above the doors detachable side screens holding sliding perspex panels. Wire wheels, overdrive gearbox, laminated windscreen, heater, adjustable steering column, detachable hard top for the 2+2, and two-tone paint were available as options.

13,650 Mark Is were built: 2,825 BN7 open two-seaters, and 10,825 BT7 2+2s

;Road test
A BT7 3000 with hardtop and overdrive tested by &quot;The Motor&quot; magazine in 1960 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0– in 11.7 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £1326 including taxes.

===Mark II===
====BN7, BT7 roadsters====
Engines fitted with three SU HS4 carburettors (total area 5.3 sq. inches) and an improved camshaft were announced at the end of May 1961. Other changes included a vertical barred front grille. Optional extras were similar to the Mark I. From August 1961 a brake servo was also available as an optional extra, which greatly improved braking performance. These were the last true Big Healey roadsters; the BN7 Mark II was discontinued in March 1962, and the BT7 Mark II in June 1962

;Road test
A 3000 Mark II BT7 (699DON) with hardtop and overdrive tested by the British magazine &quot;The Motor&quot; in 1961 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0– in 10.9 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £1362 including taxes.

====BJ7 sports convertible====
The 3000 sports convertible Mark II was launched at the end of August 1962. It was a true convertible with almost saloon car comfort, a new wrap-around windscreen, wind-up side windows, swiveling quarter lights and a quick-action folding roof. Twin SU HS6 carburettors replaced the triple SUs (total area 5.3 sq. inches, a 9.25% reduction). Austin-Healey claimed it could exceed 115 mph.

91.5 per cent of all 1963 Austin Healey 3000 cars were exported, with the majority going to North America.

11,564 Mark IIs were made: 355 BN7 open two-seaters, 5,096 BT7 2+2s, and 6,113 BJ7 2+2 sports convertibles
===Mark III===
====BJ8 sports convertible====
The 3000 sports convertible Mark III was announced in February 1964 with power increased from 136 bhp to 150 bhp by a new higher lift camshaft. SU HD8 carburettors replaced HS6 units increasing the choke size from 1.75 to 2 inches, or total area 6.3 sq. inches, increasing by 30.6%. Power-assisted braking became standard instead of optional. The new car&#x27;s fascia displayed its speedometer and tachometer directly in front of the driver. Upholstery was now in Ambla vinyl

The Mark III BJ8 remained in production until the end of 1967 when manufacture of the Austin-Healey 3000 ceased.

In May 1964 the &quot;Phase II&quot; version of the Mark III was released, which gained ground clearance through a modified rear chassis. In March 1965 the car received separate indicator lights.

17,712 Mark IIIs were manufactured.

===Mark IV===

As the life of the 3000 was drawing near, Healey considered various updates to help the car remain saleable while also meeting stricter emissions and safety regulations. Closest to reaching production was the 4000 Mark IV, of which three examples were finished in 1966 and 1967. Two were automatics and one was fitted with the four-speed manual transmission from the Jaguar E-type. The bodywork was wider, the interior altered and made more spacious due to the extra width, but the main change was the aluminium 3.9-litre Rolls-Royce engine – the same unit which was fitted to the Vanden Plas 4-litre R.

===Pininfarina &quot;grand tourer&quot;===
Pininfarina exhibited the 3000 as a closed roof grand tourer, designed by Pio Manzù, at the October 1962 Earls Court Show. It was the winning design from a competition by Swiss motoring publication &quot;Auto-Jahr&quot;.

===In racing===
Austin Healey 3000s have a long competition history, and raced at most major racing circuits around the world, including Sebring (USA), Le Mans (France), and Mount Panorama Circuit, Bathurst (Australia). The BMC competitions department rallied the 3000 from its introduction, but the development of the works cars effectively ended in 1965, mainly because of the success of the Mini Cooper &#x27;S&#x27;.

<text>GUADEC, formerly the GNOME Users And Developers European Conference, is an annual developer conference whose prime topic is the development of the GNOME desktop environment and its underlying base software such as GTK, GStreamer, etc.

The first GUADEC was organised by Mathieu Lacage as a one-off event and attracted around seventy GNOME contributors. It was the first time many of them had met in person. The conference was judged a success, and has been held annually in different locations since then, organised by local volunteers. The size has increased five-fold since the first conference.

<doc id="682323" wikidata="Q295858" url="?curid=682323" title="Nicolás Massú">
<text>Nicolás Alejandro Massú Fried (; born 10 October 1979), nicknamed &quot;El Vampiro&quot; (Spanish, &#x27;the vampire&#x27;), is a Chilean tennis coach and a former professional player. A former world No. 9 in singles, he won the singles and doubles gold medals at the 2004 Athens Olympics. He is the only man to have won both gold medals at the same Games since the re-introduction of Olympic tennis in 1988, and they were the first two Chile&#x27;s Olympic gold medals. Massú also reached the final of the 2003 Madrid Masters and won six singles titles. He was the coach of 2020 US Open champion and former world No. 3 Dominic Thiem from 2019 to 2023.

==Tennis career==
===Early years===
Massú is Jewish, as is his mother, Sonia Fried. His father, Manuel Massú, is of Lebanese and Palestinian ancestry. His mother is of Israeli and Hungarian-Jewish descent. His maternal grandfather, Ladislao Fried Klein, was a Hungarian-born Jew who survived the Nazi occupation of Hungary by hiding, as his parents did not survive. His maternal grandmother, Veronika (née Vegvari), was a Holocaust survivor who was imprisoned in the Auschwitz concentration camp.

Massú was introduced to tennis by his grandfather at age five. From age 12, he was trained at the Valle Dorado tennis academy, near Villa Alemana, by Leonardo Zuleta, with whom he perfected his forehand and double-handed backhand. He later trained at the Nick Bollettieri Academy, in Florida, alongside Marcelo Ríos, and later at the High Performance Center in Barcelona, Spain.

===Juniors===

Massú became a professional tennis player in 1997. That year, he won the prestigious juniors year-end Orange Bowl tournament and was doubles world champion, as well as No. 5 in singles. He also claimed the boys&#x27; doubles competitions at both Wimbledon and the US Open, partnering Peru&#x27;s Luis Horna at the former and countryman Fernando González at the latter.

===ATP Tour===
In August 1998, Massú won his first Futures tournament, in Spain. The following month, he claimed his first Challenger event, in Ecuador. He won his second Challenger tournament in June 1999, in Italy. In September 1999, he successfully defended his title in Ecuador. In November 1999, he won the Santiago Challenger event and cracked the top 100 in singles for the first time.

In May 2000, Massú reached his first ATP tournament final, at the U.S. Clay Court Championships in Orlando, Florida, where he lost to Fernando González. Later in August, he lost again to another Chilean—Marcelo Ríos—in his US Open debut. In January 2001, Massú reached his second ATP event final, in Adelaide, Australia.

Massú&#x27;s first ATP title came in February 2002 in Buenos Aires, where he defeated Argentine Agustín Calleri in a three-set final, after being down match point. At the 2003 event, Calleri took revenge and defeated him in the first round, a loss that pushed Massú out of the top 100 in singles and forced him to play Challengers once again. In April 2003, he reached the Bermuda Challenger final.

Massú claimed his second ATP title in July 2003 in Amersfoort, Netherlands. The following week, he reached the final of the Kitzbühel tournament, cracking the top 50 in singles for the first time. In September, he made three consecutive tournament finals, including a win at a Challenger event and his third ATP title in Palermo. In October, he reached the final at the Madrid Masters Series tournament, losing to Juan Carlos Ferrero in the final. He ended the year at world No. 12.

In mid-2004, Massú parted ways with Argentine coach Gabriel Markus, whom he replaced with Chilean Patricio Rodríguez. In July 2004, Massú won his fourth ATP title in Kitzbühel and then went on to win two gold medals at the 2004 Olympics (see below). Thanks to his outstanding performance at the Olympics, he reached his career-high ATP singles ranking of world No. 9. In November, he underwent groin surgery and therefore entered the 2005 season off top form. He ended an unremarkable 2005 with a six-match losing streak, although ironically 2005 also saw his best performance at a Grand Slam tournament as he reached the fourth round of the US Open, losing to Guillermo Coria.

He was the first player to be beaten by Stan Wawrinka in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament, at the 2005 French Open.

In January 2006, Massú lost to José Acasuso in the final of his hometown event at Viña del Mar. In February, he won his sixth ATP title in Costa do Sauipe, Brazil. In April, he reached the final of the Casablanca event in Morocco. In July, he lost to Novak Djokovic in the final of the Amersfoort tournament.

In January 2007, Massú repeated his Viña del Mar showing of 2006, losing to Luis Horna in straight sets. In July, he began an eight-match losing streak that ended in October in Saint Petersburg.

Massú had an early exit at the Viña del Mar tournament in January 2008, losing to Sergio Roitman in the first round. Because he was defending points from a final showing in 2007, the following week he fell to No. 97 in the world. In July, his singles ranking plummeted to No. 138, his worst since November 1999. Later in the year, he won the Florianópolis II Challenger event and was a finalist in two other tournaments at that level.

Massú began 2009 by not winning a match during his first five tournaments and losing his opening Davis Cup singles match against Croatia in March. He broke his losing streak at the Indian Wells Masters, beating Argentine Eduardo Schwank in three sets in the first round.

===Olympics===
Massú has represented Chile at three Summer Olympics: 2000 Sydney, 2004 Athens and 2008 Beijing. At the 2000 event&#x27;s opening ceremony, he was his country&#x27;s stand in flag bearer after Marcelo Ríos failed to show up. In his first-round match he beat Sláva Doseděl, but lost to Juan Carlos Ferrero in the next round.

The story was different in Athens, where Massú captured both singles and doubles titles. On August 21, he and Fernando González defeated Nicolas Kiefer and Rainer Schüttler of Germany to win the doubles competition, making history by giving Chile its first ever Olympic gold medal in any sport, after nearly a full century of Olympic participation. Massú and González came from four straight match points in the fourth set tie-break to claim the gold. The following day, he captured his second gold medal by defeating American Mardy Fish in five sets in the men&#x27;s singles final. Following his victory in singles, he was declared as &quot;Athlete of the Day&quot; by the 2004 Athens Olympics&#x27; organization.

Because of his low ranking, Massú was granted a wild card to compete in both singles and doubles events in Beijing. He only managed to reach the second round in singles and was ousted on his first match in doubles, where he partnered again with Fernando González. To this day, Massú is the only male player in the Open Era to have won gold medals in both singles and doubles at the same Olympic Games.

===Davis Cup===
Massú began playing for Chile in Davis Cup matches in 1996. He played in the World Group, representing Chile in the years from 2005 to 2007 and again from 2009 to 2011. He ended his participation with a record of 29–17, including 17–4 on clay.

In 2014, Massú took the position of captain of the Chile Davis Cup team, with former No. 1 Marcelo Ríos as coach. After five years since the start of his tenure as captain, the team achieved a comeback to the elite group of the competition and qualified for the 2019 Davis Cup Finals, eight years after its last participation.

===Maccabiah Games===
Massú is a veteran of the 2001 Maccabiah Games in Israel, the international Jewish Olympics.

==Coaching career==
Massú was the coach of Dominic Thiem, 2020 US Open Men&#x27;s Singles Champion and winner of the 2019 Indian Wells Masters 1000 tournament. Massú played one doubles tournament in 2019, partnering Dominic&#x27;s brother, Moritz Thiem.

He is currently coaching Hubert Hurkacz since November 2024.

==Playing style==
Massú was known for his fighting spirit, especially when playing for Chile, which he demonstrated at the 2004 Olympics and in numerous Davis Cup matches. He has also turned around difficult matches and had a style characteristic of a clay-court specialist, with strong baseline play characterized by a solid forehand and backhand.

<text>Izvestia (, &quot;The News&quot;) is a daily broadsheet newspaper in Russia. Founded in February 1917, &quot;Izvestia&quot;, which covered foreign relations, was the organ of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, disseminating official state propaganda. It is now described as a &quot;national newspaper&quot; of Russia.

The word &quot;&quot; in Russian means &quot;bring news&quot; or &quot;tidings&quot;, &quot;herald&quot; (an official messenger bringing news), derived from the verb &quot;izveshchat&quot; (&quot;to inform&quot;, &quot;to notify&quot;).

==History==
===1917–1991===
During the Soviet period, while &quot;Pravda&quot; served as the official mouthpiece of the Communist Party, &quot;Izvestia&quot; expressed the official views of the Soviet government as published by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Its full name was &quot;Izvestija Sovjetov Narodnyh Djeputatov SSSR&quot; (in Russian, &quot;Известия Советов народных депутатов СССР&quot;, the &quot;Reports of Soviets of Peoples&#x27; Deputies of the USSR&quot;).

The Izvestia Trophy ice hockey tournament was named after the newspaper between 1969 and 1996.

&quot;Nedelya&quot; was the weekend supplement of Izvestia.

===1992–present===
Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, &quot;Izvestia&quot; now describes itself as a &quot;national newspaper&quot; of Russia. The newspaper was owned by a vast holding company of Vladimir Potanin which had close ties with the government. A controlling stake in &quot;Izvestia&quot; was purchased by state-owned Gazprom on 3 June 2005, and included in the Gazprom Media holding. According to the allegations of the Committee to Protect Journalists, Raf Shakirov, editor-in-chief of &quot;Izvestia&quot;, was forced to resign because the government officials did not like the paper&#x27;s coverage of the Beslan school hostage crisis. Other sources informed that Potanin had asked him to leave for fear the Kremlin would be riled by the explicit photographs of the massacre published by &quot;Izvestia&quot;. As of 2005, the circulation of &quot;Izvestia&quot; was 240,967. Its 2007 circulation certified by TNS Gallup Media was 371,000 copies. Until his death on 1 October 2008, the chief artist was Boris Yefimov, the centenarian illustrator who had worked as Joseph Stalin&#x27;s political cartoonist.

In 2008, Gazprom Media sold &quot;Izvestia&quot; to National Media Group.

In May 2024, the European Union accused the newspaper of spreading propaganda and placed it on its sanctions list.

<doc id="682325" wikidata="Q5215389" url="?curid=682325" title="Kotekan">
<text>Kotekan is a style of playing fast interlocking parts in most varieties of Balinese Gamelan music, including Gamelan gong kebyar, Gamelan angklung, Gamelan jegog and others.

Kotekan are &quot;sophisticated interlocking parts,&quot; &quot;characteristic of gong kebyar and several other Balinese gamelan styles, that combine to create the illusion of a single melodic line that often sounds faster than any single human could possibly play.&quot; According to Colin McPhee: &quot;Composed of two rhythmically opposing parts which...interlock to create a perpetual flow of sound, the &quot;kotekan&quot; adds sheen and intensity to the music, ...calls for the utmost rhythmic precision...[and] lies in the top register of the gamelan.&quot;

In &quot;kotekan&quot; there are two independent parts called polos and , each of which fills in the gaps of the other to form a complete rhythmic texture. In Gamelan gong kebyar, Kotekan is usually played on the higher-pitched &quot;gangsa&quot; and &quot;reyong&quot; as embellishment to the main melody (&quot;pokok&quot;) played on the &quot;calung&quot; and &quot;ugal&quot;.

:&quot;Note: In the transliteration of Balinese used here, the letter &quot;c&quot; represents a sound similar to English &quot;ch&quot;.&quot;

== Nyog cag ==

&quot;Nyog cag&quot; is a straightforward alternation between &quot;polos&quot; and &quot;sangsih&quot;, each playing only every other note of a scale or other melodic figuration. Though structurally the simplest form of &quot;kotekan&quot;, &quot;nyog cag&quot; can be difficult to play accurately, especially because it is used at the fastest tempos.

== Nyok cok ==
&quot;Nyok cok&quot; is an ornamentation of the &quot;pokok&quot; melody in which &quot;polos&quot; and &quot;sangsih&quot; anticipate the next pitch of the &quot;pokok &quot;in unison and then each plays one of its neighbor tones.

== Kotekan telu ==

In &quot;kotekan telu&quot;, the &quot;polos&quot; and &quot;sangsih&quot; share a set of three pitches (&quot;telu&quot; means three in Balinese). One of the parts plays the low and middle pitches, the other plays the middle and high pitches. The middle pitch is always played in unison by both parts except if &quot;kotekan telu&quot; is played by the reyong, because the two or four players share the same set of pots.

== Kotekan empat ==

&quot;Kotekan empat&quot; is similar to &quot;kotekan telu&quot;, except in this case there are four pitches (&quot;empat&quot; means &quot;four&quot; in Balinese). One part plays the lower two and the other plays the upper two; there is no sharing of pitches. Usually the lowest and highest pitches are struck simultaneously, and the interval they form varies depending upon where the notes fall in the scale and the tuning of the ensemble.

== Kotekan theory ==
&quot;Kotekan&quot; are typically composed by elaborating the &quot;pokok&quot; melody. The subdivisions of the composite &quot;kotekan&quot; are usually played four or eight times faster than the &quot;pokok&quot;. Since the &quot;kotekan patterns&quot; are either three notes (&quot;telu&quot;) or three sounds (the &quot;kotekan empat&quot; has two solo pitches plus the open interval), the simple patterns do not repeat every four or eight notes. This can be illustrated in the following example:

 Kotekan 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 etc...
 Pokok 1 . . . 2 . . . 3 . . . 1 . . . etc...

The above is the most basic example of a kotekan &quot;telu&quot;. In the example the numbers refer to the different pitches being played. The &quot;kotekan&quot; is repeating the same pattern over and over. Note that the &quot;pokok&quot; is exactly the same pattern played four times slower. The &quot;kotekan&quot; would be divided into &quot;polos&quot; and &quot;sangsih&quot; as follows:

 Polos 1 2 . 1 2 . 1 2 . 1 2 . 1 2 . 1 etc...
 Sangsih . 2 3 . 2 3 . 2 3 . 2 3 . 2 3 . etc...
 Pokok 1 . . . 2 . . . 3 . . . 1 . . . etc...

If the &quot;pokok&quot; changes, the &quot;kotekan&quot; will follow it. Here is a simple example that is similar to the first example except that it changes direction.

 Kotekan 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 etc...
 Pokok 1 . . . 2 . . . 3 . . . 2 . . . etc...

Notice that this example can repeat over and over. Here is what the separate parts might look like:

 Polos 1 2 . 1 2 . 1 2 . 2 1 . 2 1 . 2 etc...
 Sangsih . 2 3 . 2 3 . 2 3 2 . 3 2 . 3 2 etc...
 Pokok 1 . . . 2 . . . 3 . . . 2 . . . etc...

Here is the same melody with &quot;kotekan empat&quot;:

 Polos 1 2 . 1 2 . 1 2 . 2 1 . 2 1 . 2 etc...
 Sangsih 4 . 3 4 . 3 4 . 3 4 3 . 4 3 . etc...
 Pokok 1 . . . 2 . . . 3 . . . 2 . . . etc...

The &quot;polos&quot; part is the same as the previous example. However, the &quot;sangsih&quot; part is very different.

<text>Highway 26, also known as the Barkerville Highway, is a minor east-west highway in the North Cariboo region of the Central Interior of British Columbia, Canada. First opened in 1967, it provides access to the community of Wells and the famous gold rush town of Barkerville at the foot of the Cariboo Mountains, respectively 75 and 81 km (47 and 51 mi) east of the highway&#x27;s junction with Highway 97 at Quesnel. Also accessed by the route is Bowron Lakes Provincial Park, a popular canoeing expedition circuit, the cutoff for which is between Barkerville and Wells. Since Highway 26 is very lightly travelled, it has not needed any major improvements since its opening. Its route is approximately the same as that of the Cariboo Wagon Road.

==History==
The electoral district was created in 1976 from Halifax—East Hants riding. This riding lost territory to South Shore—St. Margarets as a result of the 2012 federal electoral redistribution. Following the 2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution, it will gains the Fairmount area from Halifax and the Chebucto Peninsula from South Shore—St. Margarets and will lose the Bedford, Hammonds Plains and Lucasville areas to Sackville—Bedford—Preston. These changes will come into effect at the calling of the 2025 Canadian federal election.

<doc id="682329" wikidata="Q430067" url="?curid=682329" title="Postal codes in Spain">
<text>Spanish postal codes were introduced on 1 July 1984, when the introduced automated mail sorting. They consist of five numerical digits, where the first two digits, ranging 01 to 52, correspond either to one of the 50 provinces of Spain or to one of the two autonomous cities on the African coast.

== Two-digit prefixes ==

The first two digits of a Spanish postal code identify the province or autonomous city it belongs to. The numbers were assigned to the 50 provinces of Spain ordered alphabetically at the time of implementation. The official names of some of the provinces have since changed, either to the regional language version of the name (e.g. from the Spanish to the Basque ) or to adopt the name of the autonomous community instead of the provincial capital (e.g. Santander to Cantabria). In these cases, the originally assigned code has been maintained, resulting in some exceptions to the alphabetical order. In addition, Ceuta and Melilla were originally included within the postal areas of Cádiz and Málaga respectively; in 1995 they were assigned their own codes and hence ended up at the end of the list.

The list below includes all 52 two-digit prefixes assigned to the 50 provinces and two autonomous cities. Included in brackets are the names of the provinces that were used for alphabetical sorting at the time of implementation, if different from the current name used in English.

* 01 Álava
* 02 Albacete
* 03 Alicante
* 04 Almería
* 05 Ávila
* 06 Badajoz
* 07 Balearic Islands ()

* 45 Toledo
* 46 Valencia
* 47 Valladolid
* 48 Biscay ()
* 49 Zamora
* 50 Zaragoza
* 51 Ceuta
* 52 Melilla
==Following digits==
The third digit of a Spanish postal code is used to identify major cities or basic itineraries. A zero denotes a provincial capital, e.g. San Sebastián, as capital of the province of Gipuzkoa, uses the postal code 200xx.

The fourth and fifth digits are used to identify delivery areas, route itineraries or rural link itineraries.

Some codes are reserved for special use at the province capital:
* 070: official use by Correos
* 071: to address state agencies at the given province
* 080: P.O. boxes and mail lists

<doc id="682330" wikidata="Q2564633" url="?curid=682330" title="King's Official Birthday">
<text>The King&#x27;s Official Birthday is the selected day in most Commonwealth realms on which the birthday of the monarch is officially celebrated in those countries. It does not necessarily correspond to the date of the monarch&#x27;s actual birth.

The sovereign&#x27;s birthday was first officially marked in the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1748, for King George II. Since then, the date of the king or queen&#x27;s birthday has been determined throughout the British Empire and, later, the Commonwealth of Nations, either by royal proclamations issued by the sovereign or viceroy, or by statute laws passed by the local parliament.

The date of the celebration today varies as adopted by each country and is generally set around the end of May or start of June, to coincide with a higher probability of fine weather in the Northern Hemisphere for outdoor ceremonies. In most cases, it is an official public holiday, sometimes aligning with the celebration of other events. Most Commonwealth realms release a Birthday Honours list at this time.

==Australia==
Most Australian states and territories observe the King&#x27;s Birthday on the second Monday in June, except in Western Australia and Queensland. As Western Australia celebrates Western Australia Day (formerly known as Foundation Day) on the first Monday in June, the governor of Western Australia each year proclaims the day on which the state will observe the King&#x27;s Birthday, based on school terms and the Perth Royal Show. There is no firm rule to determine this date, though it is usually the last Monday of September or the first Monday of October. Some regional areas of Western Australia celebrate the King&#x27;s Birthday public holiday on alternative days for locally significant dates or events. In 2012, Queensland celebrated the holiday in October, as the June holiday was reserved to mark Elizabeth II&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee as Queen of Australia, after which the holiday then for three years reverted to its traditional date in line with the other eastern Australian states. However, starting in 2016, Queensland celebrates the holiday on the first Monday of October.
Norfolk Island celebrates Bounty Day on 8 June, so King&#x27;s Birthday is held on the Monday after the second Saturday in June. Christmas Island has other holidays and does not hold a King&#x27;s Birthday holiday at all.

The day has been celebrated since 1788, when Governor Arthur Phillip declared a holiday to mark the birthday of the king of Great Britain. Until 1936, it was held on the actual birthday of the monarch, but, after King George V died, it was decided to keep the date on the second Monday in June. This has more evenly spaced out public holidays throughout the year. While George V&#x27;s successor, Edward VIII, also celebrated his birthday in June, the three sovereigns since have not: George VI&#x27;s birthday was in December, very close to public holidays for Christmas, Boxing Day, and New Years; Elizabeth II&#x27;s birthday fell shortly after holidays for Good Friday and Easter and very close to ANZAC Day, while Charles III&#x27;s birthday is in November, shortly after Remembrance Day.

The King&#x27;s Birthday weekend and Empire Day (24 May) were the traditional times for public fireworks displays in Australia. The sale of fireworks to the public was banned in various states through the 1980s and by the Australian Capital Territory on 24 August 2009. Only Tasmania and the Northern Territory allow the sale of fireworks to the public. The King&#x27;s Birthday Honours List, in which new members of the Order of Australia and other Australian honours are named, is released around the date of the King&#x27;s Birthday weekend each June.

==Belize==
Belize celebrates the birthday of the King annually in May. The day is known as &quot;Sovereign&#x27;s Day&quot;, and is marked by parades in Belize City. Horse races, conducted by the National Sports Council, are held in Belize City&#x27;s National Stadium and Orange Walk Town&#x27;s People&#x27;s Stadium. A cycling race, also arranged by the National Sports Council, is held between the cities of Belmopan and Cayo. There is a flag-raising ceremony among other events held at schools and universities to commemorate Sovereign&#x27;s Day.

==Canada==
The monarch&#x27;s birthday has been observed in Canada since the reign of King George III, when it, 4 June, was considered &quot;the most important holiday of the year in early Upper Canada.&quot; The annual muster of the militia was held on the King&#x27;s birthday, in the most central or most convenient place in each district, and every able-bodied man between the ages of 18 and 60, aside from Quakers, Mennonites, and other pacifist sects, was to take part. The drill ended with three cheers for the King before the participants were free to mingle about; they were known to engage in horseshoe pitching contests, wrestling matches, and settling old scores by fights before, in the summer night, the settlers and their families visited the houses of their neighbours or patronised the taverns; for the latter, it was their most profitable day all year. For the officers, a dinner was held, during which toasts were made to the King, the Duke of York (the Commander-in-Chief), the Army and Navy, and the ladies.
It was in 1845 that the Parliament of the Province of Canada passed a statute to authorise the recognition of Queen Victoria&#x27;s birthday, 24 May, as a public holiday. After Victoria died in 1901, 24 May became Victoria Day and the official date in Canada of the reigning monarch&#x27;s birthday changed through various royal proclamations: for Edward VII, it continued by yearly proclamation to be observed on 24 May, but, was 3 June for George V and 23 June for Edward VIII (their actual birthdays).

Edward VIII abdicated on 11 December 1936, three days before the birthday of his brother and successor, George VI. The new King expressed to his ministers his wish that his birthday not be publicly celebrated, in light of the recent circumstances. However, the Prime Minister at the time, William Lyon Mackenzie King, the rest of Cabinet, and the Lord Tweedsmuir, the Governor General, felt otherwise, seeing such a celebration as a way to begin George&#x27;s reign on a positive note. George VI&#x27;s official birthday in Canada was thereafter marked on various days between 20 May and 14 June.
The first official birthday of Elizabeth II, daughter of George VI, was the last to be celebrated in June; the haphazard format was abandoned in 1952, when the Governor General-in-Council moved Empire Day and an amendment to the law moved Victoria Day both to the Monday before 25 May. The Canadian monarch&#x27;s official birthday in Canada was, by regular viceregal proclamations, made to fall on this same date every year between 1953 and 1957, when a royal proclamation issued on 5 February established the Queen&#x27;s official birthday as the last Monday before 25 May, making the link between Victoria Day and the sovereign&#x27;s official birthday permanent, though not expressed explicitly.

Though the holiday was called &quot;Sovereign&#x27;s Birthday&quot;, the 1957 proclamation itself designated the day as &quot;the Queen&#x27;s birthday&quot;. As such, in May 2023, following the accession of Charles III as King of Canada, a new proclamation declared &quot;the celebration in Canada of the birthday of the sovereign to be Victoria Day&quot;, thus applying the official birthday to all future monarchs, regardless of gender, and, by replacing the Monday before 25 May with Victoria Day, making the connection with Victoria Day explicit.

Nonetheless, the two holidays are entirely distinct in law (Victoria Day fixed by statute and the Sovereign&#x27;s Birthday determined by proclamation depending on the Interpretation Act, which requires the Sovereign&#x27;s Birthday to be observed either on the day itself or on a day proclaimed for its observance) except for being appointed to be observed on the same day; it is a general holiday in Nunavut and New Brunswick (there prescribed as a day of rest on which retail businesses must be closed). Though the media mention only Victoria Day and the public are therefore almost totally unaware of the existence of the official birthday, the sovereign&#x27;s official birthday is marked by the firing of an artillery salute in the national and provincial capitals and the flying of the Royal Union Flag on buildings belonging to the federal Crown, if there is a second flag pole available.
The Canadian monarch has been in Canada for his or her official birthday twice: The first time was 20 May 1939, when King George VI was on a coast-to-coast tour of Canada and his official birthday was celebrated with a Trooping the Colour ceremony on Parliament Hill. The second time was when Queen Elizabeth II was in Canada from 17 to 25 May 2005, to mark the centennial of the entries of Saskatchewan and Alberta into Confederation; no government-initiated events, aside from those dictated by normal protocol, were organised to acknowledge the official birthday. Charles III, who was Prince of Wales and heir apparent to the throne at the time, and his wife, Camilla, in 2012 attended events in Saint John, New Brunswick, and Toronto, Ontario, marking the Queen&#x27;s official birthday. In 2014, the couple attended a ceremony in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island.

==New Zealand==
Until 1936, New Zealand celebrated the actual birthday of the sovereign. After Edward VIII abdicated on 11 December 1936, and George VI was proclaimed king on his birthday, 14 December, two King&#x27;s Birthday holidays were celebrated that year. The second holiday that year caused some industrial confusion and loss. This led the government to introduce the Sovereign&#x27;s Birthday Observance Act 1937. It set the official birthday to be the first Monday in June (which it has been to this day), and this was first observed in 1937. The legislation was changed after Elizabeth II became Queen through the Sovereign&#x27;s Birthday Observance Act 1952. Although that act makes reference to &quot;Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second&quot;, it was still in place in 2023, the first time that New Zealand observed the King&#x27;s Birthday for Charles III. The Holidays Act 2003 refers to the holiday as &quot;the birthday of the reigning Sovereign&quot;.

King&#x27;s Birthday celebrations are mainly official, including the King&#x27;s Birthday Honours list and military ceremonies. There were proposals, with some political support, mainly affiliated with Labour, to replace the holiday with Matariki (Māori New Year) as an official holiday. In 2022, the Te Kāhui o Matariki Public Holiday Act declared Matariki as an official holiday separate from the Queen&#x27;s Birthday, making said proposals obsolete. The idea of renaming the Queen&#x27;s Birthday weekend to Hillary weekend, after mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary, was raised in 2009.

==Papua New Guinea==
The King&#x27;s Official Birthday is a public holiday in Papua New Guinea. In Papua New Guinea, it is usually celebrated on the second Monday of June every year. Official celebrations occur at hotels in Port Moresby, and much of the day is filled with sports matches, fireworks displays, and other celebrations and events. Honours and medals are given for public service to Papua New Guineans, who are mentioned in the King&#x27;s Birthday Honours List.

==Solomon Islands==
The King&#x27;s Official Birthday is a public holiday in Solomon Islands. In Solomon Islands, it is usually celebrated on the second Saturday of June every year. It is regarded as one of the most important events of the year in Solomon Islands. The day starts with the police marching band performing in the capital city of Honiara. Rallies are held all over the islands, which is followed by sporting events and custom dancing, and the celebrations and parties go long into the night.

The governor-general of Solomon Islands delivers a speech on the King&#x27;s Birthday, and honours and medals are given to those who have done valiant things and great service for Solomon Islands and its people.

==Tuvalu==
The King&#x27;s Official Birthday is a public holiday in Tuvalu. In Tuvalu, it is usually celebrated on the second Saturday of June every year. Tuvaluans celebrate it with church services and prayers, singing &quot;God Save the King&quot; and &quot;&quot;, flag hoisting, public speeches, a Royal Salute, and a parade. As the King&#x27;s Birthday is a public holiday, all government offices, educational institutions, and most businesses are closed for the day.

, Tuvaluans also celebrated the birthday of Charles, Prince of Wales, who at the time was heir to the Tuvaluan Throne. Heir to the Throne Day was a public holiday in November.

==United Kingdom==

The monarch&#x27;s birthday has been celebrated in the United Kingdom since 1748, during the reign of King George II. Even when their real birthday was in May or June, the celebration was often on a different date. Edward VII, who reigned from 1901 to 1910 and whose birthday was on 9 November, moved his official birthday to summer, in the hope of good weather. King George VI, born on 14 December, celebrated his official birthday from 7 to 12 June. Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s official birthday was (usually) the second Saturday in June. King Charles III&#x27;s first official birthday was on 17 June 2023, the third Saturday in June; and his second on 15 June 2024, also the third Saturday in June.

The day is marked in London by the ceremony of Trooping the Colour, which is also known as the King&#x27;s Birthday Parade. The list of Birthday Honours is also announced at the time of the Official Birthday celebrations. In British diplomatic missions, the day is treated as the national day of the United Kingdom. Although it is not celebrated as a specific public holiday in the UK, some civil servants are given a &quot;privilege day&quot; at this time of year, which is sometimes merged with the Spring bank holiday (last Monday in May) to create a four-day weekend. The King&#x27;s birthday is the last remaining privilege day, the other 1.5 days having been abolished in 2014 and replaced by a 1.5 day increase in civil servants&#x27; annual leave.

Parts of Scotland also mark Queen Victoria&#x27;s birthday on the last Monday before or on 24 May.

===British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies===

The King&#x27;s official birthday is a public holiday in most British Overseas Territories (those parts of Britain&#x27;s sovereign territory that lie outside the archipelago of the British Isles), including Anguilla, the Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, Montserrat, Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha and the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the Crown Dependencies (which are not parts of Britain&#x27;s sovereign territory, but are dependencies of the British Crown), including Guernsey and Jersey in the Channel Islands, and the Isle of Man. Bermuda formerly marked the occasion with a public holiday but in 2008 the Progressive Labour Party government of the territory decided the day would be, beginning the following year, replaced by National Heroes&#x27; Day, despite protests from some residents of the island, who signed a petition calling for retention of The Queen&#x27;s Official Birthday. The Queen&#x27;s Official Birthday continues, nonetheless, to be marked by a public parade on Front Street in the City of Hamilton (with the first King&#x27;s Birthday Parade since the death of King George VI held on 15 June, 2024), and by a &quot;Queen&#x27;s Birthday Party&quot; at Government House. The Falkland Islands celebrate the actual day of King Charles III&#x27;s birth, 14 November, as a public holiday. (November is a spring month in the southern hemisphere where the islands are located).

==Other Commonwealth countries==
In Saint Kitts and Nevis, the date of the King&#x27;s Official Birthday is set each year. The Cook Islands, a self-governing country in free association with New Zealand, also celebrates the holiday on the second Monday of June.

Despite Fiji abolishing the monarchy in 1987, following a second military coup d&#x27;état, the Queen&#x27;s Birthday continued to be celebrated each 12 June until 2012. That year, the military government of Commodore Frank Bainimarama announced the holiday would be abolished, despite Bainimarama being a monarchist himself.

<doc id="682332" wikidata="Q7790590" url="?curid=682332" title="Thomas Henry Burke (civil servant)">
<text>Thomas Henry Burke (29 May 1829 – 6 May 1882) was an Irish civil servant who served as Permanent Under Secretary at the Irish Office for many years before being assassinated during the Phoenix Park Murders on Saturday 6 May 1882. The assassination was carried out by an Irish republican organisation known as the Irish National Invincibles. 

The newly appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland, Lord Frederick Cavendish, although not the intended victim, was assassinated alongside him while they walked through Phoenix Park in Dublin. The victims were stabbed in the neck and chest with surgical blades.

Burke was the Invincibles&#x27; intended target because he had been working for the Dublin Castle administration as head of the Civil Service for many years and was a supporter of the Irish Coercion Acts during the Land War. Irish nationalists referred to Burke as the &quot;Castle rat&quot;.

==Life==
Thomas Henry Burke was one of six sons of William Burke of Knocknagur, Tuam, County Galway and Emma Dillon. He was born in Waterslade House, Tuam. He was educated at Oscott College, Sutton Coldfield, near Birmingham, and also in Belgium and Germany.

Burke&#x27;s family was descended from that of Sir Ulick Burke, 1st Bt of Glinsk, County Galway, on whom Charles I conferred a baronetcy in 1628. One brother was Sir Theobald Hubert Burke, 13th Baronet of Glinsk, another brother was the artist Augustus Nicholas Burke.

==Burke&#x27;s outlook==
Burke was in favour of both Home Rule and reform of land issues, although as a civil servant he did not make his views known publicly. Lord Spencer described him as a &quot;warm-hearted Irishman of strong national tendencies&quot;. Burke&#x27;s support of various Crimes Acts imposed in Ireland was an issue which marked him out for assassination. Burke supported the retention of the unpopular Act in 1882, though his position was somewhat soft.
Burke&#x27;s attitude towards land issues was demonstrated by his intervention on the Kirwan estate in Carraroe, County Galway in 1880. Numerous eviction notices were about to be served on tenants and the chances of confrontation were high. Burke used his personal acquaintance with the Kirwans to attempt to defuse the situation. Burke&#x27;s report to Forster lamented the

==Funeral and interment==
Burke was interred in a private ceremony at Prospect Cemetery, Glasnevin on Tuesday 9 May 1882. The grave is situated at Plot Zb 74 &amp; 75. His remains were removed from the Chief Secretary&#x27;s Lodge at 9 am, by hearse, followed by 43 carriages containing mourners. The coffin bearing the inscription, &quot;Thomas Henry Burke, Born 29th May 1829, Died 6th May 1882, R.I.P.&quot; The Very Rev. Monsignor Lee, Dean of Dublin officiated, assisted by the Rev. E.J. Quinn and Rev. W.J. Hurley. Thomas Burke was laid to rest beside his father William, under a Celtic cross. The ornamental carved stone cover of the grave bears the inscription, &quot;Sacred to the memory of Thomas Henry Burke Esq. Who was murdered in the Phoenix Park on May 6th, 1882. He pleased God and was beloved&quot;.

The second monument, composed mainly of black marble from Cong erected adjacent to the grave, bears the inscription,
Thomas&#x27; estate at death was £1901 11s. 4d. according to probate records of 7 June 1882.

==Memorial Prize==
The Department of Education in Northern Ireland administers the Burke Memorial Fund which was established in 1883, a trust fund from which the payment of an annual prize of £150 is awarded to the best entrant to GCSE examinations taken in Northern Ireland.

<doc id="682345" wikidata="Q10600986" url="?curid=682345" title="Ninja Burger">
<text>is a parody website started in late 1999, purporting that a sect of noble ninja have taken to secretly delivering fast food meals, anywhere, anytime, within 30 minutes or less. Failure to deliver within the ascribed time limit results in seppuku. Some of Ninja Burger&#x27;s rivals include Pirate Pizza, Otaku Bell, and Samurai Burger. The site riffs on many of the same points as Real Ultimate Power, another ninja parody website.

Ninja Burger became well known after appearing on and becoming an affiliate of Fark, and soon after it was turned into a role-playing game. The site has also spawned a series of comic strips, several short films, a second role-playing game, a card game, a multimedia CD, and a book. On March 9, 2003, portions of a commercial for the website aired on the Food Network; the full version of this commercial is now available on YouTube.

==RPGs==

===First Edition===
According to the Ninja Burger website, the first edition of the game was published by 9th Level Games in 2001 using a variant of the BEER Engine used in their Kobolds Ate My Baby! game.

===Second Edition===
A second edition of the &quot;Ninja Burger RPG&quot; was published as a PDF in March 2006, and is available in print through Key20 as of August, 2006 (). It uses an all new ruleset based on Atomic Sock Monkey Press&#x27; &quot;Prose Descriptive Qualities&quot; (&quot;PDQ&quot;) system. The game features a campaign set in San Francisco, California, which is (according to the back story) the home of Ninja Burger Headquarters. Unlike the original game, it allows players to take on specific roles within the organization—such as chef, driver, etc. -- in addition to the baseline role of &quot;ninja&quot;. It also greatly expands upon the scope and scale of the original setting; whereas the 9th Level Games&#x27; game was designed for 30-minute game sessions where just about everyone died at the end, the 2nd Edition is designed for longer campaigns that allow characters to grow and develop as they normally would in most RPGs.

Like other games utilizing the &quot;PDQ&quot; system (including &quot;Dead Inside&quot; (&quot;DI&quot;); &quot;Monkey, Ninja, Pirate, Robot: the RPG&quot; (&quot;MNPR:RPG&quot;); and &quot;Truth &amp; Justice&quot; (&quot;T&amp;J&quot;)), &quot;Ninja Burger&quot; is notable for the flexibility and simplicity of its rule systems. The core mechanic is to add 2d6 plus a freeform statistic or set of statistics, and compare to a difficulty number, either a fixed difficulty number or the opponent&#x27;s roll. In conflicts, the amount which you beat another character&#x27;s roll by is the amount of damage or failure ranks (see below). Player statistics are rated in five named ranks: Poor [-2], Average [+0], Good [+2], Expert [+4], and Master [+6].

Conflicts result in the accumulation of either &quot;failure ranks&quot; (which recover at the end of the contest) or &quot;damage ranks&quot; (which may take longer to heal). Each point of either type means that the loser must choose a statistic to downgrade by one rank. So if you lose a conflict roll by 3, you must lower three stats each by one rank, or one stat by three ranks (with a minimum of Poor: -2). You can choose any stat to take your damage in—i.e. you can downgrade your &quot;Accounting&quot; quality based on a hit in a fight. When you can&#x27;t lower your stats any more (i.e. a hit when all stats are at Poor [-2]), then you have lost the contest.

&quot;Ninja Burger&quot; adds several elements to the system, including various Honor mechanics (along with a Seppuku system should you lose too much honor) and Ninja Magic. Particularly noteworthy is the role of the Dispatcher; more than just a Game Master, the Dispatcher is an active participant in the game, being a member of the team and, in almost every respect, just another Player Character.

===No Honor Edition===
A special &quot;No Honor Edition&quot; edition of the &quot;Ninja Burger RPG&quot; premiered at Gen Con in August 2008 (). As the name suggests, one of the major changes was to remove the leveling mechanism (Honor) from the game, along with other features and content to produce a slimmed-down volume in the shape and spirit of the First Edition game.

==Card game==
A popular card game based on the Ninja Burger license was also published by Steve Jackson Games in November, 2003 (). 
It shares only the core concept with the &quot;Ninja Burger RPG&quot;, using a completely different set of rules and game mechanics designed and developed by Steve Jackson. It was illustrated by Greg Hyland, creator of &quot;Lethargic Lad&quot;.

A supplement to the card game entitled &quot;Sumo-Size Me&quot; was published in Spring, 2005 (), and was also illustrated by Greg Hyland. The supplement was bundled with the original rules and published in 2009 as the &quot;Ninja Burger Secret Ninja Death Touch&quot; edition (UPC 837654–320259).

A Russian translation of the original card game, entitled &quot;Ниндзя Бургер&quot;, was also released in 2009.

==Ninja Burger Employee Handbook==
The &quot;Ninja Burger: Honorable Employee Handbook&quot; originally appeared as a self-published PDF through the website RPGNow, and was published in 2006 through Citadel Press (). Originally slated for release on June 6, it appeared in bookstores two weeks early and was available over the Memorial Day weekend along with Maddox&#x27;s &quot;The Alphabet of Manliness&quot;, another release from Citadel&#x27;s Rebel Base Books line.

The &quot;Handbook&quot; purports to be a real employee handbook from Ninja Burger, and as such is an obvious parody of &quot;real-life&quot; employee handbooks. It includes material such as: Ninja Burger History, Fitness, Recipes, Safety Tips, Etiquette, Salary &amp; Benefits, Health Coverage and the company&#x27;s (literal) Termination policy. Also included are a Ninja Burger job application, menu and employee newsletter.

==Web comics==
Several long-running webcomics have appeared on the Ninja Burger website. The longest-running is called the NB Crew; drawn by Rocco Commisso, it documents the adventures of a small Ninja Burger crew (consisting of Max, Doughna, Steve, Minja and Jade) as they battle various enemies. Other strips include the original (and now defunct) Ninja Burger Comic Strip (by Lazarus Berry) and The Ninja Shift (by Recca Hanabishi). Each strip exists in its own Ninja Burger universe, and the characters, situations and laws of physics operate independently within each strip. None follows any &quot;official storyline,&quot; and each is developed independently of the others.

Ninja Burger has also been referenced on other webcomic sites, including All About Eda, Stalag 99, Sam and Fuzzy (coincidental, according to the author), Megatokyo, and Sluggy Freelance. It is also featured as a brief &quot;commercial&quot; in the &quot;S.T.E.A.M.&quot; anime fandub movie.

==Influences==
Though not directly influenced by it, Ninja Burger&#x27;s concept is similar to a Saturday Night Live sketch from the late 1970s by John Belushi entitled &quot;Samurai Delicatessen&quot; In this skit, Belushi played a samurai working in a New York City deli who would commit seppuku if customers were unhappy with his sandwiches (which he prepared using his katana). Other likely influences include &quot;Snow Crash&quot;, which features a ninja-like deliveryman named Hiro Protagonist who works for a Mafia pizzeria and would be assassinated if a delivery took longer than half an hour, and &quot;A Fistful of Yen&quot;, a short parody of &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; from &quot;Kentucky Fried Movie&quot;.

==Day of the Ninja==

In 2003, the creators of Ninja Burger declared that December 5 would be celebrated as Day of the Ninja. On this day, people are encouraged to dress as ninja, engage in ninja-related activities, and spread information on ninja online. December 5 was originally chosen because December 5, 2003 marked the release of Tom Cruise&#x27;s film &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; (which featured a scene where samurai battled ninja). Since then the focus has shifted towards the more familiar Pirates versus Ninjas conflict, and the day has served as a virtual counterpoint to International Talk Like a Pirate Day.

The first year&#x27;s events were small, but in 2004 the holiday gained international support from a group of French performers, who staged elaborate ninja poses in front of famous landmarks (such as the Eiffel Tower). This led to increased press coverage from, among other things, the French Disney magazine Picsou. The holiday drew support from the popular Ask a Ninja website in 2006; a podcast on November 30 of that year discussed an alternative explanation for the holiday&#x27;s origin, set 1400 years ago. The release of the Ask a Ninja DVD was timed to coincide with that year&#x27;s Day of the Ninja (Dec. 5, 2006), and helped garner additional press coverage. The DVD release party itself was heavily covered by the &quot;blogosphere&quot;, with numerous references to the Day of the Ninja. Perhaps not coincidentally, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest was also released on DVD on December 5, 2006; the Ask a Ninja website had already added to the Pirates vs Ninjas meme when &quot;the Ninja&quot; gave a blistering review of the film in an earlier podcast.

2007 saw official acknowledgment from the press including NPR&#x27;s Morning Edition, as well as a coordinated ninja-themed video game announcement from EA and the official release of the Pirates Vs. Ninjas Dodgeball website. G4 Network&#x27;s &quot;Attack of the Show!&quot; also celebrated 2007&#x27;s Day of the Ninja by replacing usual host Kevin with the &quot;Ask a Ninja&quot; Ninja, and the network also ran a Ninja Warrior marathon, with many more episodes than usual throughout the day. The Day of the Ninja is one of only two days of the year that players can get the &quot;Arr...&quot; badge in Saints Row II; it is one of the badges required for Kingpin.

Ninja Burger&#x27;s Day of the Ninja website features a Day of the Ninja PSA that was created by Fulltimeninjas.com.

Another site, ninjaday.org, has independently declared December 5 as International Creep Like a Ninja Day. Other possible names include Die Like a Pirate Day, Stalk Like a Ninja Day, Sneak Like a Ninja Day, Move Like a Ninja Day, or simply Ninja Day. According to the official website, this site and others of its kind are unrelated to Ninja Burger or the original Day of the Ninja website, although their efforts are supported.

<doc id="682346" wikidata="Q2499761" url="?curid=682346" title="Wright's stain">
<text>Wright&#x27;s stain is a hematologic stain that facilitates the differentiation of blood cell types. It is classically a mixture of eosin (red) and methylene blue dyes. It is used primarily to stain peripheral blood smears, urine samples, and bone marrow aspirates, which are examined under a light microscope. In cytogenetics, it is used to stain chromosomes to facilitate diagnosis of syndromes and diseases.

It is named for James Homer Wright, who devised the stain, a modification of the Romanowsky stain, in 1902. Because it distinguishes easily between blood cells, it became widely used for performing differential white blood cell counts, which are routinely ordered when conditions such as infection or leukemia are suspected.

The related stains are known as the buffered Wright stain, the Wright-Giemsa stain (a combination of Wright and Giemsa stains), and the buffered Wright-Giemsa stain, and specific instructions depend on the solutions being used, which may include eosin Y, azure B, and methylene blue (some commercial preparations combine solutions to simplify staining). The May–Grünwald stain, which produces a more intense coloration, also takes a longer time to perform.

Urine samples stained with Wright&#x27;s stain will identify eosinophils, which can indicate interstitial nephritis or urinary tract infection.

White blood cells stained with Wright&#x27;s stain:

<doc id="682348" wikidata="Q1376201" url="?curid=682348" title="Stigler's law of eponymy">
<text>Stigler&#x27;s law of eponymy, proposed by University of Chicago statistics professor Stephen Stigler in his 1980 publication &quot;Stigler&#x27;s law of eponymy&quot;, states that no scientific discovery is named after its original discoverer. Examples include Hubble&#x27;s law, which was derived by Georges Lemaître two years before Edwin Hubble; the Pythagorean theorem, which was known to Babylonian mathematicians before Pythagoras; and Halley&#x27;s Comet, which was observed by astronomers since at least 240 BC (although its official designation is due to the first ever mathematical prediction of such astronomical phenomenon in the sky, not to its discovery).

Stigler attributed the discovery of Stigler&#x27;s law to sociologist Robert K. Merton, from whom Stigler stole credit so that it would be an example of the law. The same observation had previously also been made by many others.

==Derivation==
Historical acclaim for discoveries is often assigned to persons of note who bring attention to an idea that is not yet widely known, whether or not that person was its original inventor – theories may be named long after their discovery. In the case of eponymy, the idea becomes named after that person, even if that person is acknowledged by historians of science not to be the one who discovered it. Often, several people will arrive at a new idea around the same time, as in the case of calculus. It can be dependent on the publicity of the new work and the fame of its publisher as to whether the scientist&#x27;s name becomes historically associated.

There is a similar quote attributed to Mark Twain:It takes a thousand men to invent a telegraph, or a steam engine, or a phonograph, or a photograph, or a telephone or any other important thing—and the last man gets the credit and we forget the others. He added his little mite—that is all he did. These object lessons should teach us that ninety-nine parts of all things that proceed from the intellect are plagiarisms, pure and simple; and the lesson ought to make us modest. But nothing can do that.

Stephen Stigler&#x27;s father, the economist George Stigler, also examined the process of discovery in economics. He said, &quot;If an earlier, valid statement of a theory falls on deaf ears, and a later restatement is accepted by the science, this is surely proof that the science accepts ideas only when they fit into the then-current state of the science.&quot; He gave several examples in which the original discoverer was not recognized as such. Similar arguments were made in regards to accepted ideas relative to the state of science by Thomas Kuhn in &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;.

The Matthew effect was coined by Robert K. Merton to describe how eminent scientists get more credit than a comparatively unknown researcher, even if their work is similar, so that credit will usually be given to researchers who are already famous. Merton notes: 
The effect applies specifically to women through the Matilda effect.

Boyer&#x27;s law was named by Hubert Kennedy in 1972. It says, &quot;Mathematical formulas and theorems are usually not named after their original discoverers&quot; and was named after Carl Boyer, whose book &quot;A History of Mathematics&quot; contains many examples of this law. Kennedy observed that &quot;it is perhaps interesting to note that this is probably a rare instance of a law whose statement confirms its own validity&quot;.

&quot;Everything of importance has been said before by somebody who did not discover it&quot; is an adage attributed to Alfred North Whitehead.

<text>The Commemorative Air Force (CAF), formerly known as the Confederate Air Force, is an American non-profit organization based in Dallas, Texas, that preserves and shows historical aircraft at airshows, primarily in the U.S. and Canada.

The CAF has about 13,000 members, more than 70 chapters, and more than 170 aircraft, including the world&#x27;s largest collection of airworthy warbirds.

==History==
The origin of the Commemorative Air Force is the organization called the &quot;Confederate Air Corps&quot; created by Oscar Harper in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1953. Led by the fictional character &quot;Thaddeus P. Throckmorton&quot; and his recruiting officer &quot;Jethro Culpepper&quot;, the CAC established several features that later became key characteristics of the CAF: folksy, tongue-in-cheek southern humor; a membership structure based on each member having the equal rank of colonel; and a rallying cry of &quot;Semper, Mint Julep&quot; (&quot;Always Mint Julep&quot;).

In 1957, Lloyd Nolen and four friends purchased a P-51 Mustang called &quot;Red Nose&quot;, splitting the $1,500 cost. In 1958, the group made their second purchase: two Grumman F8F Bearcats for $805 each. Along with the P-51, this gave the pilots two of the most-advanced piston-engine fighters to see service with the U.S. Army Air Forces and the United States Navy.

In 1960, the CAF began to seriously search for other World War II aircraft. The CAF colonels were shocked to find that the aircraft which played such a major role in winning World War II were being rapidly and systematically scrapped as obsolete with no efforts, not even by the Air Force or Navy, to preserve any for display for future generations. The warbirds that remained airworthy were mostly in private hands modified for air racing or had been converted for commercial use as air freighters and aerial firefighters.

On September 6, 1961, the CAF was chartered as a nonprofit Texas corporation to restore and preserve World War II-era combat aircraft. By the end of the year, the CAF owned nine aircraft. By 1963, the group had achieved their initial goal of acquiring one of each fighter plane operated by U.S. forces during World War II. They held their first airshow on March 10, 1963.
In 1965, the first museum building was completed at old Rebel Field, Mercedes, Texas. The CAF created a new Rebel Field at Harlingen, Texas, and moved there in 1968, occupying three large buildings including of museum space. By the end of the decade, the CAF fleet had added medium and heavy bombers such as the North American B-25 Mitchell, B-17, Consolidated B-24 Liberator. In 1971, they bought one of the two airworthy Boeing B-29 Superfortresses, &quot;FIFI&quot;.

In 1976, the CAF sponsored an air show where a B-29 bomber piloted by Paul Tibbets, the pilot who flew the B-29 which bombed Hiroshima during World War II, reenacted the atomic bombing of Hiroshima (including a mock mushroom cloud). This air show prompted the Japanese government to lodge a formal complaint with the United States Embassy, resulting in the U.S. government issuing an apology.

In 1983, the American Airpower Heritage Foundation was founded to financially support the CAF.

The group&#x27;s accomplishments were recognized in 1989 with a National Aviation Hall of Fame Spirit of Flight Award. That year, Texas Governor William Clements signed a resolution designating the CAF the air force of Texas.

In 1990, the CAF added two corporations. The first was the American Airpower Heritage Flying Museum, tasked with obtaining and maintaining the CAF&#x27;s aircraft titles. The second was the American Airpower Heritage Museum, which acquired and maintained the CAF&#x27;s non-aircraft pieces and static displays. In September 1990, CAF joined a statewide anti-littering campaign (Don&#x27;t Mess With Texas), filming a low-level, high-speed pass of the B-17 &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot; on a mock bombing run of a highway-littering pickup truck, as part of a 30-second television spot.

 In 1991, the CAF moved operations to Midland, Texas, where the group opened the CAF Airpower Museum and the American Combat Airman Hall of Fame. 

In April 2014, the CAF announced the move of their headquarters and all of the planes associated with the headquarters to Dallas Executive Airport in Dallas, Texas. The museum and its artifacts (including the nose art collection) were moved to the new headquarters, which it operates as the Henry B. Tippie National Aviation Education Center.

In 2015, the CAF acquired the C-47 &quot;That&#x27;s All, Brother&quot;, the plane that led the parachute assault on Normandy during D-Day.

===Accidents and incidents===
On September 28, 1995, a Martin B-26 Marauder operated by CAF crashed near Odessa, Texas, killing all five crew members. The NTSB found that the pilot failed to maintain minimum airspeed.

On April 14, 2001, the CAF pilot of a Fairchild PT-19A was killed in a crash shortly after takeoff at Midland International Airport; the plane&#x27;s one passenger survived. The NTSB cited the pilot&#x27;s &quot;failure to maintain airspeed which resulted in an inadvertent stall&quot;.

On May 14, 2001, both CAF crew members aboard a Vultee BT-13A died in a crash southeast of Odessa, Texas. The NTSB found that the pilot failed to maintain minimum airspeed.

On June 16, 2005, a PT-26 Cornell operated by CAF crashed in Williamson, Georgia, killing both crew members. The NTSB found that the pilot &quot;attempted a takeoff with flaps extended.&quot;

On November 12, 2022, during the Wings Over Dallas airshow, two planes owned and operated by CAF—a Bell P-63F and the Boeing B-17G &quot;Texas Raiders&quot;—suffered a mid-air collision that killed six people.

==Membership==
, the Commemorative Air Force had more than 13,000 members, in more than 70 regional groups, called wings or detachments, in 27 states and five countries. Several hundred members actively serve as pilots and flight and/or maintenance crew members committed to preserving American combat aviation heritage. The CAF is an all-volunteer organization, made up of members from all backgrounds. Membership is open to everyone age 18 or older, and cadet membership is available for those over 12 years of age. Although a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, tax-exempt group, the CAF has received financial incentives from state and local governments to move to Dallas and operate in Midland.

==Organization==
The American Airpower Heritage Group is the parent organization and is made up of four corporations:
*The Commemorative Air Force, the membership association
*A foundation that controls the financial assets and endowment
*A museum that manages the non-flying artifacts
*A flying museum that operates the flying aircraft

==Name==
The original name, Confederate Air Force, alluding to the Confederate States of America, started as a joke about the organization&#x27;s ragtag beginnings. As the collection of warbirds at Central Valley Airport in Mercedes, Texas, started to grow, one member painted the name on the side of the original North American P-51 Mustang &quot;Red Nose&quot;. The name stuck, and it grew to the point where the airport was renamed Rebel Field, all members were called &quot;colonels&quot; (a tradition which still remains), and it led to the creation of a fictitious leader named Colonel Jethro E. Culpepper. A blood chit written on the backs of flight suits and flight jackets stated, &quot;This is a CAF aviator. If found lost or unconscious, please hide him from Yankees, revive with mint julep and assist him in returning to friendly territory. CONFEDERATE AIR FORCE.&quot;
In November 2000, the group voted to rename, using the initials &quot;CAF&quot; until a permanent name was selected. Following a 2001 membership vote, the group changed its name to &quot;Commemorative Air Force&quot;, effective January 1, 2002. Many felt the name Confederate Air Force was confusing, did not accurately reflect the purpose of the organization, and was detrimental to fundraising efforts. According to CAF chief of staff Ray Kinney, &quot;In many people&#x27;s minds, the word &#x27;confederacy&#x27; brings up the image of slavery and discrimination. We, in no way, are associated with that kind of stuff. So, it gives us, in a way, a black eye.&quot;

==Aircraft==


, the CAF owned 179 aircraft, a collection known as the CAF Ghost Squadron. Its aircraft range from the small Stinson L-5 Sentinel and Ryan PT-22 to the giant Boeing B-29 Superfortress; the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress; and the Consolidated Liberator B Mk I/B-24A Liberator AM927. Many of the CAF aircraft are rare; the CAF operates one of only two flying examples of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, and the only remaining flightworthy Curtiss SB2C Helldiver. Others, such as the B-24/LB-30 Liberator; the Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero; and the Douglas SBD Dauntless are one of only two or three of that type left flying today. The CAF also operates Axis and Warsaw Pact aircraft such as the MiG 17 Fresco C.

==AIRSHO==
AIRSHO is a yearly event at Midland International Airport showcasing the CAF&#x27;s aircraft. Because its aircraft tend to be spread out over large geographic distances, and most Ghost Squadron aircraft rarely fly more than a few hours from their home base, AIRSHO is also an opportunity for CAF members to meet up. Ghost Squadron aircraft usually attend AIRSHO every other year. The CAF AIRSHO is the largest warbird air show in the world, with more than eighty warbirds flying per show.

<text>Ardent Records is an American record label based in Memphis, which was founded by John Fry in 1959. Ardent of the 1960s and 1970s featured pop music acts and was distributed by Stax Records from 1972 until 1975. It is best remembered today for Big Star, whose first two albums, released in 1972 and 1974, helped define the style known as power pop. The label was initially an attempt by the R&amp;B-focused Stax to move into rock music, but distribution problems prevented any releases from succeeding. Big Star became widely known through 1980s reissues and the long delayed first release of Third/Sister Lovers, recorded in 1974.

The label was revived in the 1990s with two divisions: Alternative Mainstream and Contemporary Christian. Former Big Star guitarist Alex Chilton released recordings on the Ardent mainstream division, which also released recordings by bands such as Spot, Jolene, Two Minutes Hate, The Idlewilds, Neighborhood Texture Jam, and Techno-Squid Eats Parliament. The mainstream division of Ardent Records was closed in the mid-1990s.

Ardent&#x27;s Christian label issued its first Christian releases in 1995. Initial projects included albums from Big Tent Revival, Skillet, and Smalltown Poets. To date, Ardent Records has released more than 35 albums by artists such as Todd Agnew, Jonah33, Smalltown Poets, Satellite Soul, Clear, All Together Separate, Brother&#x27;s Keeper, Justifide, Before You Breathe, NonFiction, and Joy Whitlock. In 2005, Ardent signed a deal with INO Records, a division of Integrity Media, to distribute and market its entire roster. The label&#x27;s albums are recorded at Ardent Studios in Memphis.

<doc id="682354" wikidata="Q4404065" url="?curid=682354" title="Chinatown, Washington, D.C.">
<text>Washington, D.C.&#x27;s [[Chinatown]] is a small, historic area of Downtown Washington, D.C. along H and I Streets between 5th and 8th Streets, Northwest. The area was once home to thousands of Chinese immigrants, but fewer than 300 remained in 2017. The current neighborhood was the second in Washington to be called “Chinatown” since 1931. Originally, the first Chinatown was built in the Federal Triangle on the south side of Pennsylvania Avenue some time after 1851, but was moved to the H Street area when a new federal building was built there. In 1986, a Chinese gate was built over H Street at 7th Street. By 1997, prominent landmarks such as the Capital One Arena, a sports and entertainment arena, occupied the area. The neighborhood is served by the Gallery Place station of the Washington Metro.

== History ==
The Chinatown area was once home to many Chinese immigrants, who began to move into the area in the 1930s, having been displaced from Washington&#x27;s original Chinatown along Pennsylvania Avenue by the development of the Federal Triangle government office complex. The newcomers marked it with Chinese signage and decorative metal latticework and railings. At its peak, Chinatown extended from G Street north to Massachusetts Avenue, and from 9th Street east to 5th Street.

Chinatown remained a strong community into the 1960s, but the 1968 Washington, D.C., riots that followed Martin Luther King&#x27;s assassination, and the ensuing decline of D.C.&#x27;s downtown area, led many of the Chinese residents of Chinatown to move to the suburbs of Maryland and Virginia. Throughout the 1970s, &quot;Eastern Wind: The Asian-American Community Newsletter of Washington, D.C.&quot; published editorials and opinions reacting to the changing neighborhood. An &quot;Open Letter to the Asian Community&quot; advocated for political engagement from the community to preserve Chinatown, and a petition sought to protest the displacement of residents by new plans for development in the area.

In the early 1980s, the D.C. government built a new convention center between 9th and 11th streets, displacing Chinese residents living in the area. 
In 1982, the city built the Wah Luck House apartments at 6th and H Streets, NW, to accommodate the displaced residents. Designed by architect Alfred Liu, the apartment building introduced modern Chinese design motifs due to the red-paneled balconies.

In 1986, the city dedicated the Friendship Archway, a traditional Chinese gate. This was a collaboration between the Washington DC government and its sister city Beijing. It was intended to attract visitors in addition to recognizing the local Chinese residents. As part of the same effort, the Metro station was given the name Gallery Place-Chinatown until 2011.

The MCI Center was completed in 1997 (renamed Verizon Center in 2006 and Capital One Arena in 2017). After the construction of the arena, &quot;AsianWeek&quot; said in 2000 that the neighborhood &quot;barely&quot; remains.

Numerous writers have cited Chinatown as an example of gentrification and an example of the commodification of culture. In 2015, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that only about 300 Chinese-Americans remained in the borough, and many of them were being forced out by their landlords. In 2022 Ruth Tam, et al. stated in a WAMU-FM article that Chinese ethnic activity moved to suburban areas outside of Washington, DC, and shopping for ethnic related goods is no longer done in Washington, DC itself.
===Annual parade===
Each year the Chinese Lunar New Year is celebrated with a parade that &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called, &quot;one of the city’s signature events for more than 50 years&quot;. Lunar New Year is a celebration of light with honors family and is said to wipe away bad luck. The annual parade is described as a &quot;massive parade&quot; features dragon dances. The parade was cancelled in 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.

On February 10, 2019, the parade celebrated the year of the pig. &quot;It featured traditional lion and dragon dances, firecrackers, beauty pageant winners and community groups&quot;. The parade route runs along 8th Street NW and in 2020 it featured a person dressed as Caishen and another dressed as a Giant panda. 2020 was the year of the rat and some parade goers had small rat toys.

Another parade which occurs in Chinatown is The Chinese Merchants Association parade. One such parade was hosted on September 10, 1957, William C. Beall was in the Chinatown section of Washington D.C. to photograph a parade. He worked as a staff photographer for &quot;The Washington Daily News&quot;. Two-year-old Allan Weaver attended the parade and he approached police officer Maurice Cullinane to ask if he was a US Marine. The image was printed in many publications and it also appeared on the back cover of Life (magazine) and it won the 1958 Pulitzer Prize for Photography. Beall named the image &quot;Faith and Confidence&quot;.

==Demographics==

In 2010, the census tract that contains Chinatown has around 3,000 residents. Chinatown is only 21% Asian, compared to 1990, when it had a majority Chinese American population. In 1990, its population was 66% Asian and 20% African American. Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Chinatown is relatively small in terms of size and number of Chinese residents in comparison to other major Chinatown neighborhoods in the U.S., such as those in San Francisco and in Manhattan. Approximately half of Chinatown&#x27;s residents live in the Wah Luck House, which has 153 units of apartment complexes. The closest Chinese supermarket, the Great Wall Supermarket, is fourteen miles west in Falls Church, Virginia.

After the deadly 1968 riots following the April assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., many Chinese people sought a more economically stable and safe environment and moved out of Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Chinatown, relocating to suburban neighborhoods in Fairfax County, Virginia, and Montgomery County, Maryland. In 1970, there were roughly 3,000 Chinese residents in Washington&#x27;s Chinatown; by 2016, the number was fewer than 600, many of them seniors residing in two low-income housing developments. North Potomac, Maryland, is 18.4% Chinese American, the highest of any community within the Washington metropolitan area. The Maryland city of Rockville also has a significant population of residents of Chinese descent, at eight percent. In Virginia, sizable Chinese American communities are located in Centreville, Chantilly, and Floris, south of Washington Dulles International Airport.

==Businesses and establishments==

Along with the development of the Verizon Center, historic buildings, mainly along the west side of 7th Street, were renovated and tenanted, primarily with nationally known brand shops and dining establishments. Within a short time, a significant mixed-use office-residential-retail development on the southeast corner of 7th and H streets commenced construction. These developments, which included restaurants, shops, a cinema complex, and a bowling alley, together with the Verizon Center, transformed the area into a bustling scene for nightlife, shopping, and entertainment. An anomaly is that most of the businesses are no longer representative of Chinatown, yet due to city design mandates put in place by the Chinatown Steering Committee in anticipation of urban development, even national chains hang their names in Chinese outside their stores. As a result, D.C.&#x27;s Chinatown can be categorized as semiotic landscape different than other Chinatowns. Chinatown has become home to many high-growth technology companies, such as Blackboard, Blue State Digital, LivingSocial, and The Knowland Group. It is also the location of the Washington branch of the Goethe-Institut.
Chinatown&#x27;s most prominent businesses are the approximately 20 Chinese and Asian restaurants, almost all of which are owned by Asian American families. Among the most well-known are Chinatown Express, Eat First, Full Kee, and Tony Cheng&#x27;s. One of the restaurants, Wok &amp; Roll, occupies what was once the Mary E. Surratt Boarding House — the meeting place for John Wilkes Booth and his conspirators in Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s assassination. Another is located in a house once owned by the On Leong Chinese Merchants Association, which was among the first Chinese organizations to move into the neighborhood; today the structure is on the National Register of Historic Places.

The neighborhood is home to a Chinese video store, several general stores, and numerous Chinese American cultural and religious charities. Chinatown has one Chinese church, Chinese Community Church, located at 500 I Street. Chinese Community Church was founded in 1935, initially at L Street, but relocated in 2006 to its current I Street location. The Sixth &amp; I Historic Synagogue has been restored and is the scene of cultural events.

The Washington DC Chinatown Community Cultural Center offers numerous activities, classes and services.

==Housing==
 the housing stock includes rowhouses, condominium complexes, and a few townhouses. Much of the housing is for rental use.

 the Wah Luck House () has many of the remaining ethnic Chinese residents, and this continued in 2018. The complex opened in 1982. In a period until 2018, the ownership of the complex had changed. The designer of the complex was Alfred H. Liu, who immigrated to the United States from Taiwan.

==Transportation==

The Gallery Place—Chinatown Washington Metro station (on the Red, Green, and Yellow Lines), which opened in 1976, serves the neighborhood. The name of the station was changed to Gallery Place-Chinatown in 1986. Two important Metrobus routes cross at 7th and H Streets.

, on a once monthly basis, a shuttle to a suburban shopping center allows the residents of Wah Luck House to shop for ethnic groceries.

==Cityscape==
The law of the District of Columbia requires businesses in the Chinatown zone to have some form of name in Chinese characters, in either the Traditional Chinese or Simplified Chinese scripts.

The chairperson of the Chinatown Development Corporation, Alfred Liu, designed the Friendship Archway, the community&#x27;s paifang, which was commissioned by the District of Columbia Government. Construction of the paifang began in June 1986. The idea came when Marion Barry visited China in May 1984 and conversed with the Mayor of Beijing, Chen Xitong. There was criticism from Lawrence Locke, the head of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association (CCBA), and other Chinatown residents who were aligned with the Republic of China on Taiwan, and who disagreed with influence from the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The CCBA had plans to create a different paifang, through it never materialized and the CCBA announced in 1988 that it nixed the idea.

==Education==
Residents are zoned to District of Columbia Public Schools. zoned schools are Walker-Jones Education Campus (a K-8 school) and Dunbar High School.

==In culture==
Within the FBI-commissioned film &quot;Game of Pawns&quot; the D.C. Chinatown is used as a stand-in for Shanghai.

<doc id="682371" wikidata="Q367805" url="?curid=682371" title="2007 FIFA Women's World Cup">
<text>The 2007 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, the fifth edition of the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, was an international football competition for women held in China from 10 to 30 September 2007. Originally, China was to host the 2003 edition, but the outbreak of SARS in that country forced that event to be moved to the United States. FIFA immediately granted the 2007 event to China, which meant that no new host nation was chosen competitively until the voting was held for the 2011 Women&#x27;s World Cup.

The tournament opened with a record-breaking match in Shanghai, as Germany beat Argentina 11–0 to register the biggest win and the highest scoring match in Women&#x27;s World Cup history, records which stood until 2019. The tournament ended with Germany defeating Brazil 2–0 in the final, having never conceded a goal in the entire tournament. The Germans became the first national team in FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup history to retain their title.

The golden goal rule for extra time in knockout matches was eliminated by FIFA, although no matches went to extra time (and therefore, none required a penalty shoot-out).

==Teams==
The qualified teams, listed by region, with numbers in parentheses indicating final positions in the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Ranking before the tournament were:
==Venues==
The venues selected to host the competition were:

==Squads==
==Match officials==
FIFA&#x27;s Refereeing Department selected 14 referees and 22 assistant referees from around the world to officiate the 32 games that made up the final tournament. Candidate referees for the tournament were placed under scrutiny from 2005 onwards and attended a series of training camps. Candidates refereeing standards were regularly monitored at various tournaments around the globe before a final list was prepared. This was followed by a training camp in the Canary Islands in January 2007 and a final period of preparation and training at the home of FIFA in Zürich in May. No referees were chosen from the Oceania Football Confederation at the finals. The original selection group was made up of 42 entrants, 6 of which failed fitness tests resulting in the final group of 36 being confirmed for China. The United States was the only country represented by two referees.

Unlike the men&#x27;s tournaments, the quartets of match officials do not necessarily come from the same country or confederation. This selection system was explained by Sonia Denoncourt, the head of women&#x27;s refereeing at FIFA&#x27;s Refereeing Department, &quot;We don&#x27;t have as many referees among the women and we certainly don&#x27;t want to sacrifice quality. What we are looking for above all is compatibility on the field of play and the closest possible language links in the team selected for each game. The most important thing for us is that the referees have a good performance in the match.&quot; A fourth official was chosen from those referees not officiating a game at that time.

The referees stayed together throughout the competition at their hotel base in Shanghai. From there they travelled to the various venues for their designated games, before returning to base camp to continue with their specialised training programmes. As well as fitness training, they attended regular theory sessions and reviewed previous matches to try to identify possible errors and improve their performance levels. A psychologist was also assigned to the group to help with their mental preparations ahead of games.



==Draw==
The group draw took place on 22 April 2007 at the Guanggu Science and Technology Exhibition Centre in Wuhan after the completion of the qualifying rounds.

FIFA automatically seeded the host and defending champions, slotting China and Germany into Group D and Group A, respectively. The FIFA Women&#x27;s World Ranking for March 2007 was used to determine the teams to occupy the other seeded positions, B1 and C1. United States were ranked first, Germany second and Norway third, so the United States and Norway were also seeded.

Also, no two teams from the same confederation could draw each other, except for those from UEFA, where a maximum of two teams from UEFA could be drawn into the same group. Group B quickly became dubbed the group of death since three of the top five teams in the world were drawn in this group – the USA (1st), Sweden (3rd) and North Korea (5th), according to the June 2007 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Rankings, the last to be released before the tournament. The same four teams were drawn together in Group A in the 2003 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, on that occasion the US and Sweden progressed to the knockout stages.

==Coverage==
Numerous TV stations around the world provided coverage of the tournament. One notable example is the Chinese-language channel CCTV-5, which also broadcast over the internet via TVUnetworks.

==Monetary rewards==
For the first time in FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup history, all teams received monetary bonuses according to the round they reached (all in USD):
* Champions: $1,000,000
* Runners-up: $800,000
* Third place: $650,000
* Fourth place: $550,000
* Quarter-finalists: $300,000
* First round exit: $200,000

===Other rewards===
UEFA used the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup as its qualifying tournament for the 2008 Olympic women&#x27;s tournament. The best three performing UEFA teams would qualify for the Olympics. Originally it was thought that, should England make the top three European teams, they would compete under the United Kingdom banner. However, on 6 September 2007, FIFA issued a press release indicating that England were ineligible to participate in the 2008 Olympics as England does not have its own Olympic Committee.
For the determination of the ranking only first through fourth place, quarterfinal elimination or group phase elimination counted. If there was a need to make a distinction between teams eliminated in the quarterfinal or between teams eliminated in the group phase these teams would meet in a play-off match. In no case would the points or goal difference count for teams eliminated before the semi-final.

Germany and Norway qualified for the Olympics at the World Cup, whereas Denmark and Sweden had to enter a play-off for the third Olympics spot. Sweden won both legs of the playoffs with a total of 7–3 on aggregate to qualify for the Olympics.

==Controversies==

Kenneth Heiner-Møller and Danish players accused the Chinese hosts of harassment and covert surveillance prior to China&#x27;s first round match against Denmark. China&#x27;s Swedish coach Marika Domanski-Lyfors and her assistant Pia Sundhage were unaware of the incidents and Heiner-Møller absolved them of any blame, although he refused to shake hands after the match.

<doc id="682372" wikidata="Q6808701" url="?curid=682372" title="Megan Marshack">
<text>Megan Ruth Marshack (October 31, 1953 – October 2, 2024) was an American journalist and producer who served as an aide to Nelson Rockefeller from 1975 until his death on January 26, 1979. She was with Rockefeller when he died, and it was widely alleged that she was his mistress.

==Background==
Born in Los Angeles on October 31, 1953, Marshack was adopted by Sidney and Credwyn () Marshack of Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles. She graduated from California State University, Northridge, in 1975.

==Career==
In 1975, Marshack worked briefly as a reporter for the Associated Press. She then joined Rockefeller&#x27;s staff.

===Nelson Rockefeller===
Marshack worked on Rockefeller&#x27;s vice-presidential staff, in Washington, D.C., for two years, and remained with his team after he left office in 1977 and returned to New York. There had been speculation in the press regarding the nature of the relationship between Marshack and the married Rockefeller. 

Marshack was with Rockefeller on the night of his death, and did not phone an ambulance for nearly an hour after his fatal heart attack. Longtime Rockefeller aide Joseph E. Persico claimed in the PBS documentary about the Rockefeller family, &quot;It became known that he had been alone with a young woman who worked for him, in undeniably intimate circumstances, and in the course of that evening had died from a heart attack.&quot; Initial reports of Rockefeller&#x27;s death stated that the former vice president had died in his office; these were later amended to say that his death occurred at a townhouse he owned. It has also been reported that he may have died at Marshack&#x27;s apartment.

News organizations widely reported that Marshack was a named beneficiary in Rockefeller&#x27;s will, which specified that personal loans he had made to Marshack totalling $45,000 were to be forgiven. The bulk of his estate was left to his wife, Margaretta L. &quot;Happy&quot; Rockefeller, with other large gifts going to museums.

===Later career===
Marshack remained largely out of the public eye afterward, and never commented on Nelson Rockefeller; the Rockefellers were reported to have had her sign a non-disclosure agreement. For about a year after Rockefeller died, she dated 68-year-old cartoonist Charles Addams, who lived in the same apartment building as she did. In the 1980s, she began working for CBS.

In 1992, it was reported that Marshack was still living in New York, working as a news writer for WCBS-TV, but &quot;The Washington Post&quot; noted she declined to comment, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t do interviews.&quot; She remained with WCBS until around 1998, when she moved to Placerville, California, and joined the staff of the &quot;Placerville Mountain Democrat&quot; newspaper. In 2003, she married fellow journalist Edmond Jacoby, Jr.

==Later life and death==
Marshack moved to Sacramento, California, in 2022, so she could live closer to her brother. The following year, Jacoby died from complications of injuries sustained in a car accident.

Marshack died from liver and kidney failure at a care facility in Sacramento, on October 2, 2024, at the age of 70. She authored her own obituary, which was published by a local funeral home. &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed that, while she largely maintained her silence about a relationship with Rockefeller in her writing, she may have made an oblique reference in the final line, in which she quoted the song &quot;What I Did for Love&quot;.

<text>Saab Automobile AB () was a car manufacturer that was founded in Sweden in 1945 when its parent company, Saab AB, began a project to design a small automobile. The first production model, the Saab 92, was launched in 1949. In 1968, the parent company merged with Scania-Vabis, and ten years later the Saab 900 was launched, in time becoming Saab&#x27;s best-selling model. In the mid-1980s, the new Saab 9000 model also appeared.

In 1989, the automobile division of Saab-Scania was restructured into an independent company, Saab Automobile AB. The American manufacturer General Motors (GM) took 50 percent ownership. Two well-known models to come out of this period were the Saab 9-3 and the Saab 9-5. Then, in 2000, GM exercised its option to acquire the remaining 50 percent. In 2010, GM sold Saab Automobile AB to the Dutch automobile manufacturer Spyker Cars N.V.
After many years establishing a sound engineering reputation and ultimately a luxury price tag, Saab failed to build its customer base beyond its niche following. After struggling to avoid insolvency throughout 2011, the company petitioned for bankruptcy following the failure of a Chinese consortium to complete a purchase of the company; the purchase had been blocked by the former owner GM, which opposed the transfer of technology and production rights to a Chinese company. On 13 June 2012, it was announced that a newly formed company called National Electric Vehicle Sweden (NEVS) had bought Saab Automobile&#x27;s bankrupt estate. According to &quot;Saab United&quot;, the first NEVS Saab 9-3 drove off its pre-production line on 19 September 2013. Full production restarted on 2 December 2013, initially the same petrol-powered 9-3 Aero sedans that were built before Saab went bankrupt, and intended to get the car manufacturer&#x27;s supply chain re-established as it attempted development of a new line of NEVS-Saab products. NEVS lost its license to manufacture automobiles under the Saab name (which the namesake aerospace company still owns) in the summer of 2014 and later produced electric cars based on the Saab 9-3 but under its own new car designation &quot;NEVS&quot;.

==History==
===Svenska Aeroplan AB (1948–1969)===

Saab, &quot;&quot;S&quot;venska &quot;A&quot;eroplan &quot;A&quot;ktie&quot;b&quot;olaget&quot; (Swedish for &quot;Swedish aeroplane corporation&quot;), a Swedish aerospace and defence company, was created in 1937 in Linköping. The company had been established in 1937 for the express purpose of building aircraft for the Swedish Air Force to protect the country&#x27;s neutrality as Europe moved closer to World War II. As the war drew to a close and the market for fighter planes seemed to weaken, the company began looking for new markets to diversify.

An automobile design project was started in 1945 with the internal name &quot;X9248&quot;. The design project became formally known as &quot;Project 92&quot;; the &quot;92&quot; being next in production sequence after the Saab 91, a single engine trainer aircraft. In 1948, a company site in Trollhättan was converted to allow automobile assembly and the project moved there, along with the car manufacturing headquarters, which has remained there since. The company made four prototypes named &quot;Ursaab&quot; or &quot;original Saab&quot;, numbered 92001 through to 92004, before designing the production model, the Saab 92, in 1949.

The Saab 92 went into production in December 1949. 20,000 cars were sold through the mid-1950s. The 92 was thoroughly redesigned and re-engineered in 1955, and was renamed as the &quot;Saab 93&quot;. The car&#x27;s engine gained a cylinder, going from two to three and its front fascia became the first to sport the first incarnation of Saab&#x27;s trademark trapezoidal radiator grill. A wagon variant, the Saab 95, was added in 1959. The decade also saw Saab&#x27;s first performance car, the Saab 94, the first of the Saab Sonetts.

1960 saw the third major revision to the 92&#x27;s platform as the Saab 96. The 96 was an important model for Saab: it was the first Saab to be widely exported out of Sweden. The unusual vehicle proved very popular, selling nearly 550,000 examples. Unlike American cars of the day, the 93, 95 and 96 all featured the 3-cylinder 2-cycle engine, which required adding oil to the petrol tank, front-wheel drive, and freewheeling, which allowed the driver to downshift the on-the-column manual shifter without using the clutch. Front seat shoulder belts were also an early feature.

Even more important to the company&#x27;s fortunes was 1968&#x27;s Saab 99. The 99 was the first all-new Saab in 19 years and a clean break from the 92. The 99 had many innovations and features that would come to define Saabs for decades: wraparound windscreen, self-repairing bumpers, headlamp washers and side-impact door beams. The design by Sixten Sason was no less revolutionary than the underlying technology, and elements like the Saab hockey stick profile graphic continue to influence Saab&#x27;s design language.

===Saab-Scania (1969–1989)===

In 1969, Saab AB merged with the Swedish commercial vehicle manufacturer Scania-Vabis AB to form Saab-Scania AB, under the Wallenberg family umbrella.

The 99 range was expanded in 1973 with the addition of a combi coupe model, a body style which became synonymous with Saab. The millionth Saab automobile was produced in 1976.

Saab entered into an agreement with Fiat in 1978 to sell a rebadged Lancia Delta as the Saab 600 and jointly develop a new platform. The agreement yielded 1985&#x27;s Saab 9000, sister to the Alfa Romeo 164, Fiat Croma and Lancia Thema; all rode atop a common Type Four chassis. The 9000 was Saab&#x27;s first proper luxury car but failed to achieve the planned sales volume.

1978 also was the first year for the 99&#x27;s replacement: the Saab 900. Nearly one million 900s would be produced, making it Saab&#x27;s best-selling and most iconic model. A popular convertible version followed in 1986, all of which were made at the Saab-Valmet factory in Finland, making up nearly 20% of 900 sales. Even today, the &quot;classic 900&quot; retains a cult following.
===General Motors and Investor AB (1989–2000)===

In 1989, the Saab car division of Saab-Scania was restructured into an independent company, Saab Automobile AB, headquartered in Sweden; General Motors and Investor AB controlled 50% each. GM&#x27;s investment of US$600 million gave it the option to acquire the remaining shares within a decade. In the fall of 1989 Saab opened a in Malmö. Located in the old Kockums shipyard, this was a novel kind of factory with extensive worker control and a focus on workers&#x27; comfort, an effort to increase productivity and retain skilled workers. With an annual capacity of 60,000 cars (to be increased to 90,000 cars by 1995), the factory began production at a time of shrinking sales and economic contraction and only built 10,176 cars in 1990 (the only full year of production). After a review by GM, the factory changed over to a standard assembly line but was nonetheless shuttered in June 1991, after 20,664 cars had been built in about two years.

General Motors&#x27; involvement spurred the launch of a new 900 in 1994. The new car shared a platform with the Opel Vectra. Due in large part to its success, Saab earned a profit in 1995 for the first time in seven years. However, the model never achieved the cult following of the &quot;classic 900&quot; and did not achieve the same reputation for quality.

1997 marked Saab&#x27;s 50th anniversary as a car manufacturer. The company used its jubilee owners&#x27; convention to launch a replacement for the aging 9000: the Saab 9-5. The 900 received a facelift and renaming complementary to its new larger sibling: it would now be called the Saab 9-3. The 9-5 was the first Saab without a combi coupé body style option in 20 years. Filling that space was a wagon variant, introduced in 1999.
===General Motors (2000–2010)===
GM exercised its option to acquire the remaining Saab shares in 2000, spending US$125 million to turn the company into a wholly owned subsidiary.

The new close relationship yielded its first product in 2003&#x27;s all-new 9–3. The new model, marketed as a sport sedan, dropped Saab&#x27;s iconic hatchback in favour of a more conventional four-door approach. The model shared a co-developed platform (GM&#x27;s &quot;global Epsilon 1 platform&quot;) and some other components with the Opel Vectra again, but the relationship was much more of a joint engineering effort than before.

Under GM&#x27;s direction, the badge-engineered Saab 9-2X (based on the Subaru Impreza) and Saab 9-7X (based on the Chevrolet Trailblazer) were introduced in the American market in 2005 with the hope of increasing sales. Both models were a critical and commercial failure and were cancelled a few years after production began. GM also delayed the 9-3 wagon by three years, shelved a hatchback derivative of the 9-3 sedan, stalled plans for all-wheel-drive capabilities in Saab models until 2008, cancelled a 9–5 replacement in 2005, and announced a planned shift of production away from Saab&#x27;s historic home in Trollhättan to Opel&#x27;s factory in Rüsselsheim.

Owing to fading fortunes across its entire business due to a slowing economy in 2007, GM announced that the Saab brand was &quot;under review&quot; in December 2008, a process which included the possibility of selling or shuttering the car maker.

As the talks progressed, GM&#x27;s support receded, and Saab went into administration, the Swedish equivalent of America&#x27;s Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Saab&#x27;s managing director Jan-Åke Jonsson said that this was &quot;the best way to create a truly independent entity that is ready for investment&quot;. For its part, the Swedish government was reluctant to become involved, with Maud Olofsson, industry minister, stating: &quot;The Swedish state and taxpayers in Sweden will not own car factories. Sometimes you get the impression that this is a small, small company but it is the world&#x27;s biggest automaker so we have a right to make demands.&quot;

On 16 June 2009, Koenigsegg announced its intention to purchase the brand from GM. The bid was backed by a group of Norwegian investors and the Chinese car maker Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Co Ltd (BAIC). The following month, both parties announced that GM had consented to the deal. There were outstanding financial details, but a loan from the European Investment Bank was expected to cover them. The loan was approved in October, but on 24 November 2009, Koenigsegg announced that it had &quot;come to the painful and difficult conclusion that it could no longer carry out the acquisition&quot; much because of the constant delays and the difficulties coordinating the involved parties: GM, the European Investment Bank, the Swedish National Debt Office and BAIC.

It was announced on 14 December 2009, that the Chinese car manufacturer would acquire the intellectual property rights and production equipment for the previous generation Saab 9-3 and Saab 9–5 in a deal worth about US$197 million, which was enough for the company to run for three months. BAIC expressed its intention to create a new brand around the purchased technology and admitted to the purchase of &quot;three overall vehicle platforms, two engine technologies and two transmission systems.&quot;

Following the collapse of talks with Koenigsegg, GM announced that the brand would be eliminated in 2010 if it failed to secure a buyer before the close of 2009. As talks with several firms failed, including the Netherlands-based boutique sports car maker Spyker, GM formally announced its intention to wind down the Saab brand.

Undeterred, a new offer round materialised. Earlier bidders Spyker and Merbanco revised their offers and were joined by a submission from Luxembourg-based Genii Capital, which boasted the support of F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone. GM continued accepting bids until a self-imposed deadline of 7 January 2010. Acknowledging that the chances of reaching a deal with any party were very slim, they pledged to evaluate each offer with due diligence.

===Spyker/Swedish Automobile (2010–2011)===
====2010 – purchase of Saab====
On 26 January, General Motors (GM) confirmed it had agreed to sell Saab to Spyker N.V. subject to regulatory and government approval; the sale was completed on 23 February 2010. General Motors would continue to supply Saab with engines and transmissions, and also completed vehicles in the shape of the new Saab 9-4x from GM&#x27;s Mexican factory. The deal included a loan from the European Investment Bank, guaranteed by the Swedish government. It comprised US$74m in cash up front, payable to GM by July 2010, and shares in Spyker to the tune of US$320m.

====2011 – bankruptcy====
On 25 February, Spyker Cars N.V. announced that it had agreed to sell the sports car arm to focus on Saab. Spyker intended to change its name, in May, to include the Saab name.

In early 2011, Saab began to run out of money, and Spyker were not able to cover the losses. Both companies stopped paying bills, and on 30 March several suppliers refused further deliveries to Saab&#x27;s factory in Trollhättan. Initially Spyker CEO Victor Muller blamed the media for the problems, and claimed that Saab had no problems with funding. On 5 April all production was halted at Saab&#x27;s plant in Trollhättan.

Spyker CEO Victor Muller tried to obtain funding from several different sources. On 30 March his former sponsor, Russian banker Vladimir Antonov, applied to Swedish authorities, the EIB and General Motors for permission to become a shareholder in Saab. His request was denied by the EIB, citing concerns about his business practices.

On 3 May, a joint venture between Saab and Chinese carmaker Hawtai was announced. This deal quickly unraveled and on 12 May Hawtai walked away from Saab.

Plans for a new joint venture with Chinese carmaker Youngman and Chinese automotive retailer Pang Da followed shortly. After months of negotiations the companies agreed to a joint US$140 million takeover of Saab Automobile and its UK dealer network unit from Swedish Automobile, with Youngman and Pang Da taking 60 and 40 percent stakes respectively.

On 6 December, GM announced that it would not continue its licenses to GM patents and technology to Saab if the company was sold to Pang Da and Zhejiang Youngman, stating that the new owner&#x27;s use of the technology is not in the best interest of GM investors. Because of this, Saab started working on a new proposal which would not change the original ownership structure and would not include a Chinese partner as an owner of the company, but instead as a 50% owner of a new daughter company.

On 19 December 2011, with no alternatives left after GM continued to block any form of involvement with a Chinese partner, Saab officially filed for bankruptcy after a three-year fight for survival. Under Sweden&#x27;s bankruptcy laws, a party that files for bankruptcy can be bought out of bankruptcy.

On 16 April 2012, a meeting on Saab&#x27;s bankruptcy was held at the District Court of Vänersborg. The official receivers in charge of the Saab liquidation valued the assets at US$500m and the debt at US$2,000m. After subtracting the value of the assets, Saab leaves a debt of US$1,500m.

====2012 – US$3 billion damages claim====
On 6 August 2012, Spyker, represented by the law firm Patton Boggs, filed a lawsuit against General Motors in the United States District Court of the Eastern District of Michigan claiming US$3 billion in damages for the actions GM took in the fall of 2011 to stop the various proposed deals between Spyker and Youngman concerning Saab Automobile where Youngman claimed to be ready to invest several billion dollars in Saab Automobile to guarantee its future. More precisely, under the Automotive Technology License Agreement (ATLA) between GM Global Technology Operations Inc (GTO) and Saab, GM refused licensing of the platforms and technology in Saab cars if any Chinese party were to be involved in Saab&#x27;s ownership structure.

To solve this issue, Spyker and Youngman came up with a deal where Youngman would provide Saab with a loan of €200 million which would be converted into an equity interest in Saab only after Saab ceased using GM technology in its vehicles. Despite this, GM maintained that it would still refuse licensing of platforms and technology needed for production of Saab cars in Trollhättan and also threatened to cease 9-4X production at GM&#x27;s plant in Mexico, should the deal go through.

Consequently, the deal finally collapsed and Saab was forced to file for bankruptcy. According to Spyker, the actions taken by GM were not legal. Since Saab had been in receivership since the bankruptcy, and would be until the deal with Nevs was closed, Spyker and the receivers of Saab Automobile had entered into an agreement where Spyker would bear the costs of the litigation in exchange for 90% of the claim if the case is successful.

====2013 – claim dismissed ====
In June 2013, the district court dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that General Motors was within its rights to block the sale. In October 2014, the circuit court of appeals upheld the dismissal.

===National Electric Vehicle Sweden (2012–2014)===

On 13 June 2012, a press conference was held announcing that the bankruptcy assets of Saab Automobile AB and its subsidiaries Saab Automobile Powertrain AB and Saab Automobile Tools AB as well as the Saab factory had been acquired by a Chinese consortium called National Electric Vehicle Sweden (NEVS). This company was founded by Hong-Kong based National Modern Energy Holdings (NME) and Japan based Sun Investment, for the sole purpose of acquiring Saab&#x27;s bankruptcy assets.

Saab Automobile Parts AB was excluded in the deal and the Swedish National Debt Office would continue as an owner of that company. NEVS&#x27; plan was to build only purely electric vehicles with an electric version of the current 9-3 model available in 2013/2014, as well as to continue development of the replacement to the 9–3, the PhoeniX. GM continued to refuse licensing of the technology in the Saab 9-5 and 9-4X, so these models would not be produced.

In August 2012, Scania AB announced that the griffin logo used in both Scania&#x27;s and Saab Automobile&#x27;s trademark would not be allowed for use on future Saab cars with NEVS as the owner of Saab Automobile. Scania believed the logo is of high value in China and feared that it would end up in the wrong hands through the Chinese interests behind NEVS.

In January 2013, due to Sun Investment withdrawing from the project, NEVS announced a new deal with Qingdao Qingbo Investment Co. Ltd, for a 22% stake in the company. In return, NEVS/Saab would receive SEK 2bn, along with a production facility for models sold in China. Cars sold in North America and most of Europe would continue to be produced at Trollhättan, Sweden. The possibility of using Fiat/Chrysler sourced drive train components for non- electric models was also being examined.

On 12 August 2013, the Saab plant at Trollhättan reopened its doors to welcome back employees for preparations and restructuring of the production line. Production of the existing 9–3 would commence shortly with a new electric motor, while Saab finished the preparations for the new 9-3 Phoenix.

In September 2013, the first pre-production Saab-branded vehicle produced by NEVS rolled off of the assembly line. This model was mostly aesthetically identical to the previous Saab 9-3 and mainly used to test new components and assembly line equipment. NEVS announced a facelift of the exterior to be shown on a finalised production model. On 29 November 2013 NEVS announced that full-scale production would commence on 2 December 2013, having replaced the 20 percent of parts originally sourced from former Saab owner General Motors.

Following negotiations with parts suppliers, small-scale production of the petrol version of the Saab 9-3 resumed in December 2013, with sales focused on the Swedish and Chinese markets. Production stopped in May 2014, initially only short term but was extended many times. According to NEVS, this was due to Qingdao insufficiently financing NEVS operations, forcing owner Kai Johan Jiang to fund operations through private funds as well as through assets in NEVS parent company National Modern Energy Holdings Ltd.

At this time, NEVS reportedly owed around $57 million to creditors, and sought bankruptcy protection with the aim of restructuring the company. Despite protection being granted, Saab revoked the right for NEVS to use the Saab brand name. Despite optimism from NEVS that the name may be re acquired, Saab AB confirmed again in 2016 that it was cancelling the licencing agreement between the two companies, meaning future cars would be produced under the name NEVS.

After securing deals with various Chinese consortiums, including the city of Tianjin, resulting in the construction of a new factory, NEVS was acquired by Chinese conglomerate Evergrande Group in 2019. Evergrande&#x27;s subsequent financial troubles resulted in NEVS being closed in March 2023, with the company going into &quot;Hibernation Mode&quot; to avoid bankruptcy, essentially liquidating the company.

==Production==
Saab&#x27;s total world production in 2008 was 89,143 Saab vehicles produced in five countries (Sweden, Austria, United States, Mexico and Germany). Production declined sharply in 2009, as new owners struggled to deal with the company&#x27;s mounting financial problems. Production was suspended until late 2013, when the new ownership launched a limited run of 2014 model year 9-3 sedans.
Saab manufactured various models at the Valmet Automotive plant in Uusikaupunki, Finland, between 1969 and 2003, in a joint venture established in 1968 together with Valmet. After 2003 Saab did not manufacture any cars in Finland, as the production of the &quot;9-3 convertible&quot; then moved to Graz, Austria. In 2010 production of the 9-3 convertible was moved again to Trollhättan. This marked the first time that Trollhättan manufactured the 9-3 convertible.

==Models==
A common feature of Saab car types was the use of the number &quot;9&quot; in the model numbers. The final models were the 9-3 and 9-5, both of which were manufactured in Trollhättan, Sweden. Until 2008, the 9-7X was manufactured by GM along with the Chevrolet Trailblazer and its platform-mates. The exception to this naming rule is the Saab-Lancia 600, which was a re-badged Lancia Delta.

In December 2013, Nevs announced that the Saab 9-3 sedan was back in regular production, with convertible, station wagon, and electric models to follow in the next year. Production stopped in 2014.

==Safety==
Safety has a high priority in the design of Saab cars. The cars are subjected to the &quot;Älgtest&quot; (elk test) as elk are a common cause of accidents in Sweden. Saab have compiled a database containing over 6,100 real-life accidents with Saabs. The first recorded event was in 1948 where Julian Shermis had an accident.

==Endurance records==
In October 1986, the Saab Long Run took place. Three standard Saab 9000 Turbos set two world records and 21 international records at the Talladega Superspeedway in Talladega, Alabama, United States. were covered with an average speed of 213.299 km/h (132.537 mph) and with an average speed of 213.686 km/h (132.778 mph).

Ten years later, in 1996, three standard Saab 900 (NG) Turbos driven by factory test drivers and two standard naturally aspirated Saab 900s driven by journalists set new world records on the same speedway.

In early December 2006, a Wisconsin traveling salesman donated his 1989 Saab 900 SPG (Special Performance Group) to the Wisconsin Automotive Museum after amassing on the original factory engine. This mileage was verified by Saab.

==Marketing and ownership==

Dating back to 1937, Svenska Aeroplan AB (Saab) created airplanes, introducing its first car, the Saab 92001, in 1947. Currently, Saab AB is separate from Saab Automobile and is best known for its old Saab 37 Viggen fighter aircraft (the Viggen badge would be shared by a 9-3) and its successor, the current export success low cost JAS 39 Gripen swing-role fighter. This has led to an ad campaign, &quot;Born From Jets&quot;, evoking the days when Saab produced both aircraft and automobiles. Saab is imported into many countries; each has a president of the subsidiary or importer. In the US, the first president was Mr. R. Millet.

In 1983, British commercial director Tony Scott made an advertisement for the company where a Saab 900 Turbo is shown racing a Saab 37 Viggen fighter jet. In 1987, Saab created a TV advertisement called &quot;Saab suite&quot; (subtitled &quot;Ballet in 3 acts for 8 Saab 9000 Turbos&quot;). In the film, stunt drivers show incredible driving with stock cars, such as one-wheeled burnouts, bumper-to-bumper driving through a slalom, cars slaloming from opposite directions on the same course, two-wheel driving, sliding in full speed, and jumping over passing cars—all on a closed airport runway with classical music playing in the background.

To commemorate its 40th anniversary, Saab formed a &quot;Performance Team&quot; in 1987, which laid on exhibitions of automobile acrobatics and formation driving. Initially this was done with Saab 9000s, as above, then later models, such as the Saab 900 (NG) were used. All of the team&#x27;s members have previously competed in rallies, but what&#x27;s unusual is that all five Performance Team members held regular jobs at Saab: there are two engineers, a quality controller, a technician and the head of Saab&#x27;s photo studio. The picture shows these vehicles on display at the Diamond Jubilee celebrations of the Saab Aircraft Company, at Linköping, in 1997.

A Hewlett-Packard CPU-support chip features a Saab 900 Turbo 16 Cabriolet etched into its structure.

===Ownership and brand loyalty===
As the brand has an unusual image in most markets, Saab owners tend to be correspondingly offbeat: intellectuals and enthusiasts. In his studies of brand communities, Albert Muniz, professor of marketing at DePaul University in Chicago, found significant characteristics of Saab owners which he called &quot;Snaabery&quot;. These included ownership of an original, pre-GM Saab; camaraderie with other Saab drivers and contempt for other brands such as BMW. Writer John Crace characterised the typical &quot;Snaab&quot; as a creative advertising executive with large spectacles and an asymmetric hairstyle. Rüdiger Hossiep, a psychologist at Ruhr University Bochum, found that Saab drivers have the highest level of psychological involvement with their cars, being over 10 times more passionate than the average Volkswagen driver. Saab&#x27;s main three markets were Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States.

===Slogans===
* The Swedish Car with Aircraft Quality (first English slogan)

==In motorsport==
Saab competed in the Trans Am Series in 1966, entering a 96 and a 850. Saab also entered its 9-3 in the Castrol Canadian Touring Car Championship.

Saab had a factory rally team with successful drivers, Erik &quot;On-the-Roof&quot; Carlsson, Tom Trana, Simo Lampinen, Stig Blomqvist and Per Eklund. The team stopped competing in 1980. In 2012 a new Saab rally team took part in the classic historic Midnattssolsrallyt (Rally to the Midnight Sun). The S2AB Historic Rally team entered four Saab 99 Turbos, driven by ex-champions Ola Strömberg, Erik Uppsäll, Travis Decker and Jörgen Trued. S2AB (Swedish Advanced Automotive Business) is the company led by Magnus Roland, former chassis manager at Saab.

<text>The Stewart–Cassiar Highway, also known as the Dease Lake Highway and the Stikine Highway, as well as the Kitimat Highway from Kitimat to Terrace, is the northwestern-most highway in the Canadian province of British Columbia. A scenic route through some of the province&#x27;s most isolated areas, the highway first gained designation as British Columbia Highway 37 in the year 1975. At that time, its southern terminus was at the community of New Hazelton on the BC Highway 16 (the Yellowhead Highway). In 1975, with the completion of a new bridge over the Kitimat River, the highway&#x27;s Yellowhead junction was relocated to a point on Highway 16 just south of the site of Kitwanga. Highway 37 was then extended south to Kitimat in 1986 superseding what was then designated Highway 25. At the north end, the highway briefly stretches into the Yukon, becoming Yukon Highway 37.

==Route details==

Highway 37 starts its 874 km (543 mi) journey in the south at Kitimat. 59 km (37 mi) north, Highway 37 reaches Terrace, where it merges onto the Yellowhead Highway. The Yellowhead coincides with Highway 37 east for 91 km (57 mi) to Kitwanga Junction, where the Yellowhead diverges east.

North of the Yellowhead&#x27;s Kitwanga junction, Highway 37 travels 76 km (47 mi) to Cranberry Junction, and then another 80 km (50 mi) north to Meziadin Junction, where Highway 37A begins and heads west via Bear River Pass to Stewart and Hyder, Alaska. Highway 37 travels north through the Skeena Mountains for 333 km (207 mi) to the Continental Divide communities of Eddontenajon, Iskut and Dease Lake, which straddles the Stikine and Dease River basins. Another 116 km (72 mi) north and Highway 37 reaches Jade City, where a junction to the former asbestos-mining community of Cassiar is located. North of Jade City, Highway 37 travels another 120 km (75 mi) to its crossing of the 60th parallel into the Yukon Territory, becoming Yukon Highway 37 and terminating at a junction with the Alaska Highway near Upper Liard just 3.4 km (2.1 mi) later. According to the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation, &quot;Most of the route is hard surface (either pavement or sealcoat) with approximately of gravel.&quot;

==History==
The Highway 37 of today is the result of highway extension projects began in 1959.

Originally, a roadway extended south from the Alaska Highway to serve the Cassiar mining district, eventually reaching Dease Lake and joining a road to Telegraph Creek (sometimes referred to as Highway 51, but not signed as such). To the south, logging roads extended north almost as far as Meziadin Junction.

By 1968, the route of what is now 37A extended past Meziadin Junction north. This was done to allow for asbestos from Cassiar to be shipped to market via sea from Stewart. By the middle of 1972, only a few miles remained to be built between Meziadin Junction and Iskut. Four bicyclists, whose journey from Alaska to Montana was chronicled in a May 1973 National Geographic article, braved the muddy gap.

Once this route was completed, travellers only had to contend with limited hours for using the logging roads south of Meziadin Junction, roads which were upgraded during the 1970s. The completion of a new bridge over the Skeena River at Kitwanga in Mid-November 1975 gave better access to the Yellowhead Highway. Work continued through the mid-to-late 70s to upgrade the stretch of highway.

The Highway 37 corridor is slated for infrastructure enhancements as resource extraction activities increase in the Northwest region of British Columbia. The Northwest Transmission Line was constructed by BC Hydro and runs from Terrace, British Columbia to Bob Quinn Lake, largely paralleling the highway.

<text>Banco de Sabadell, S.A. () is a Spanish multinational financial services company headquartered in Alicante and Barcelona, Spain. It is the 4th-largest Spanish banking group. It includes several banks, brands, subsidiaries and associated banks. It is a universal bank and specialises in serving small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and the affluent with a bias towards international trade.

As of March 2022, the total assets of Banco Sabadell Group amounted to €253,256 billion. It has a network of 1,594 branches, 18,985 employees and 12.1 million customers.

Since 2001, it is floated on the Bolsa de Madrid and is part of the IBEX 35.

Banco Sabadell has been designated as a Significant Institution since the entry into force of European Banking Supervision in late 2014, and as a consequence is directly supervised by the European Central Bank.

==Strategic plan==
In February 2014, Banco Sabadell started its 2014–2016 business plan, Triple, that aims to leverage its new size and margin-generating capability. The main goal of the 2014–2016 Triple Plan is profitability. Key themes of the new plan are transformation (transformation of the business, transformation of the production process and transformation of the balance sheet) and internationalization (laying the foundations for becoming more international in terms of structure and resources and entering new markets).

==History==

At the end of the &quot;19th century&quot;, the city of &quot;Sabadell&quot; was known as a bustling &quot;factory city&quot; with approximately 18,000 residents, 4,000 of whom were employed in the &quot;wool industry&quot;. Together with the nearby city of &quot;Terrassa&quot;, Sabadell accounted for 66% of Spain’s wool production. Mechanization processes, introduced from 1875 onwards, led to significant productivity increases—doubling output in some steam-powered factories. This newfound efficiency enabled local industrialists to accumulate capital, leading some to begin informally lending money among themselves.

Over time, these industrialists specialized in financial operations, but no institution offered the long-term credit necessary for purchasing raw materials, such as wool imported from &quot;Argentina&quot; or &quot;Australia&quot;. This unmet need spurred the idea of creating a bank tailored to the needs of local manufacturers. The goal was to establish an institution that could facilitate payments at the local level, provide short-term credit, and support investments in international raw materials.

Although Sabadell already had a savings institution (&quot;Caixa d&#x27;Estalvis de Sabadell&quot;), founded in 1859, it focused exclusively on promoting small-scale savings and could not handle the complex financial operations required by industrialists.

On December 31, 1881, a group of 127 entrepreneurs and merchants from Sabadell, led by the &quot;Gremi de Fabricants de Sabadell&quot; (Manufacturers&#x27; Guild), founded Banco Sabadell. Its purpose was to finance local industry and supply raw materials—such as wool and coal—on more favorable terms. The bank’s initial share capital was set at 10 million pesetas, contributed by 127 shareholders, the majority from Sabadell, with a handful from &quot;Barcelona&quot; and one from &quot;Barberà del Vallès&quot;.

The bank’s first office was located in the ground floor of the guild’s building. In addition to traditional banking, Banco Sabadell initially engaged in other business activities, including buying and selling raw materials, importing machinery, and establishing electrical installations. This phase lasted until 1907, when the bank decided to divest its non-banking activities and focus solely on commercial banking operations.

=== Mid-20th Century: Growth and Modernization ===
In 1953, Banco Sabadell’s shareholders signed a syndication agreement to ensure the bank&#x27;s independence, limiting individual shareholdings to 0.7% of the total capital. This move protected the institution from potential takeovers. A year later, in 1954, the bank opened its first purpose-built branch in &quot;Plaça de Sant Roc&quot; in Sabadell, strategically located between the city hall and the former &quot;Ateneu Sabadellenc&quot;. The branch’s iconic building was designed by renowned architect &quot;Lluís Bonet i Garí&quot;.

During the 1960s, Banco Sabadell began expanding its presence to nearby towns. Its first branch outside Sabadell opened in &quot;Sant Cugat del Vallès&quot; in 1965, followed shortly by branches in &quot;Cerdanyola del Vallès&quot;, &quot;Ripollet&quot;, and &quot;Castellar del Vallès&quot;. By 1970, the bank had established itself in &quot;Barcelona&quot;, marking a significant step in its territorial expansion.

=== National and International Expansion ===
In 1977, Banco Sabadell opened its first branch outside Catalonia and began its expansion to the rest of the communities in Spain, starting in &quot;Madrid&quot;, followed by its first international branch in &quot;London&quot; in 1978, strategically located in the heart of the &quot;City of London&quot;. By 1987, the bank had expanded further internationally, opening a branch in &quot;Paris&quot;.

Banco Sabadell became a pioneer in Spain’s banking sector by embracing technological innovation. In 1986, it launched &quot;Fonobanc&quot;, a telephone banking service, followed in 1988 by &quot;Infobanc&quot;, a computer-based banking platform. These initiatives set the stage for the introduction of &quot;BancSabadellNet&quot; in 1998, Spain’s first online banking service.

In 2023, Banco Sabadell consolidated its digital operations under a new subsidiary, &quot;Sabadell Digital&quot;. This subsidiary was tasked with overseeing app development, software innovation, and cybersecurity, marking a major step in the bank’s commitment to digital transformation.

=== Stock Market Debut and Strategic Acquisitions ===
Banco Sabadell underwent significant changes starting in 1996. Under the leadership of &quot;Josep Oliu i Creus&quot;, who became chairman in 1999, the bank began an aggressive expansion strategy. It entered the &quot;IBEX 35&quot; in 2004, shortly after its initial public offering in 2001.

Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, Banco Sabadell acquired numerous institutions, including &quot;NatWest España&quot; (1996), &quot;Banco Atlántico&quot; (2004), and &quot;Banco Urquijo&quot; (2006). Notably, it acquired &quot;Caja de Ahorros del Mediterráneo&quot; (CAM) in 2012 for the symbolic price of one euro, integrating its network into the Sabadell group.

These acquisitions allowed Banco Sabadell to extend its reach internationally, particularly in the &quot;United States&quot; and &quot;Mexico&quot;. In 2015, the bank acquired &quot;TSB Banking Group&quot; in the UK, further solidifying its position in global markets.

=== Challenges and Resilience ===
The political turmoil in Catalonia during the &quot;2017 independence referendum&quot; led Banco Sabadell to relocate its corporate headquarters to &quot;Alicante (in Valencia,&quot; another autonomous communitie of Spain on October 5, 2017, citing the need to ensure the stability of deposits and customer confidence. The move was facilitated by a government decree allowing expedited relocations. Despite this, the bank faced criticism and deposit withdrawals from some quarters.

Banco Sabadell was not immune to the financial impacts of the &quot;COVID-19 pandemic&quot;. Its stock price dropped significantly but recovered strongly in subsequent years. By November 2023, its stock had risen to €1.30 per share, making it one of the fastest-recovering companies on the IBEX 35.

In 2024, Banco Sabadell rejected a hostile takeover bid from &quot;BBVA&quot;, reaffirming its independence and strategic direction.

=== Legacy and Current Status ===
Banco Sabadell remains a key player in Spain’s banking sector and has continued its growth and strategic focus into 2023. The bank manages assets valued at approximately €235 billion, marking a 6.4% decrease year-over-year due to repayments on TLTRO III loans. It employs over 21,000 people globally and operates through around 1,600 branches, emphasizing digital transformation and cost efficiency.

In 2023, customer funds reached €201 billion, with €56.6 billion allocated to savings and investment products in Spain. The bank&#x27;s liquidity remains robust, with a Loan-to-Deposit ratio of 94% and a Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of 228%. Additionally, the non-performing asset (NPA) ratio improved, demonstrating solid risk management practices. The fully loaded CET1 capital ratio rose to 13.21%, reflecting a strengthened financial position.

<text>Phage therapy, viral phage therapy, or phagotherapy is the therapeutic use of bacteriophages for the treatment of pathogenic bacterial infections. This therapeutic approach emerged at the beginning of the 20th century but was progressively replaced by the use of antibiotics in most parts of the world after the Second World War. Bacteriophages, known as phages, are a form of virus that attach to bacterial cells and inject their genome into the cell. The bacteria&#x27;s production of the viral genome interferes with its ability to function, halting the bacterial infection. The bacterial cell causing the infection is unable to reproduce and instead produces additional phages. Phages are very selective in the strains of bacteria they are effective against.

Advantages include reduced side effects and reduced risk of the bacterium developing resistance, since bacteriophages are much more specific than antibiotics. They are typically harmless not only to the host organism but also to other beneficial bacteria, such as the gut microbiota, reducing the chances of opportunistic infections. They have a high therapeutic index; that is, phage therapy would be expected to give rise to few side effects, even at higher-than-therapeutic levels. Because phages replicate &quot;in vivo&quot; (in cells of living organism), a smaller effective dose can be used.

Disadvantages include the difficulty of finding an effective phage for a particular infection; a phage will kill a bacterium only if it matches the specific strain. However, virulent phages can be isolated much more easily than other compounds and natural products. Consequently, phage mixtures (&quot;cocktails&quot;) are sometimes used to improve the chances of success. Alternatively, samples taken from recovering patients sometimes contain appropriate phages that can be grown to cure other patients infected with the same strain. Ongoing challenges include the need to increase phage collections from reference phage banks, the development of efficient phage screening methods for the fast identification of the therapeutic phage(s), the establishment of efficient phage therapy strategies to tackle infectious biofilms, the validation of feasible phage production protocols that assure quality and safety of phage preparations, and the guarantee of stability of phage preparations during manufacturing, storage, and transport.

Phages tend to be more successful than antibiotics where there is a biofilm covered by a polysaccharide layer, which antibiotics typically cannot penetrate. Phage therapy can disperse the biofilm generated by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, the interactions between phages and biofilms can be complex, with phages developing symbiotic as well as predatory relationships with biofilms.

Phages are currently being used therapeutically to treat bacterial infections that do not respond to conventional antibiotics, particularly in Russia and Georgia. There is also a phage therapy unit in Wrocław, Poland, established in 2005, which continues several-decades-long research by the Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy of the Polish Academy of Sciences, the only such centre in a European Union country. Phages are the subject of renewed clinical attention in Western countries, such as the United States. In 2019, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved the first US clinical trial for intravenous phage therapy.

Phage therapy has many potential applications in human medicine as well as dentistry, veterinary science, and agriculture. If the target host of a phage therapy treatment is not an animal, the term &quot;biocontrol&quot; (as in phage-mediated biocontrol of bacteria) is usually employed, rather than &quot;phage therapy&quot;.

==History==


The discovery of bacteriophages was reported by British bacteriologist Frederick Twort in 1915 and by French microbiologist Felix d&#x27;Hérelle in 1917. D&#x27;Hérelle said that the phages always appeared in the stools of &quot;Shigella&quot; dysentery patients shortly before they began to recover. He &quot;quickly learned that bacteriophages are found wherever bacteria thrive: in sewers, in rivers that catch waste runoff from pipes, and in the stools of convalescent patients&quot;. Phage therapy was immediately recognized by many to be a key way forward for the eradication of pathogenic bacterial infections. A Georgian, George Eliava, was making similar discoveries. He travelled to the Pasteur Institute in Paris, where he met d&#x27;Hérelle, and in 1923, he founded the Institute of Bacteriology, which later became known as the George Eliava Institute, in Tbilisi, Georgia, devoted to the development of phage therapy. Phage therapy is used in Russia, Georgia and Poland, and was used prophylactically for a time in the Soviet army, most notably during the Second World War.

In the Soviet Union, extensive research and development soon began in this field. In the United States during the 1940s, commercialization of phage therapy was undertaken by Eli Lilly and Company.

While knowledge was being accumulated regarding the biology of phages and how to use phage cocktails correctly, early uses of phage therapy were often unreliable. Since the early 20th century, research into the development of viable therapeutic antibiotics had also been underway, and by 1942, the antibiotic penicillin G had been successfully purified and saw use during the Second World War. The drug proved to be extraordinarily effective in the treatment of injured Allied soldiers whose wounds had become infected. By 1944, large-scale production of penicillin had been made possible, and in 1945, it became publicly available in pharmacies. Due to the drug&#x27;s success, it was marketed widely in the US and Europe, leading Western scientists to mostly lose interest in further use and study of phage therapy for some time.

Isolated from Western advances in antibiotic production in the 1940s, Soviet scientists continued to develop already successful phage therapy to treat the wounds of soldiers in field hospitals. During World War II, the Soviet Union used bacteriophages to treat soldiers infected with various bacterial diseases, such as dysentery and gangrene. Soviet researchers continued to develop and to refine their treatments and to publish their research and results. However, due to the scientific barriers of the Cold War, this knowledge was not translated and did not proliferate across the world. A summary of these publications was published in English in 2009 in &quot;A Literature Review of the Practical Application of Bacteriophage Research&quot;.

There is an extensive library and research center at the George Eliava Institute in Tbilisi, Georgia. Phage therapy is today a widespread form of treatment in that region.

As a result of the development of antibiotic resistance since the 1950s and an advancement of scientific knowledge, there has been renewed interest worldwide in the ability of phage therapy to eradicate bacterial infections and chronic polymicrobial biofilm (including in industrial situations).

Phages have been investigated as a potential means to eliminate pathogens like &quot;Campylobacter&quot; in raw food and &quot;Listeria&quot; in fresh food or to reduce food spoilage bacteria. In agricultural practice, phages have been used to fight pathogens like &quot;Campylobacter&quot;, &quot;Escherichia&quot;, and &quot;Salmonella&quot; in farm animals, &quot;Lactococcus&quot; and &quot;Vibrio&quot; pathogens in fish aquaculture, and &quot;Erwinia&quot;, &quot;Xanthomonas&quot;, and others in plants of agricultural importance. The oldest use is, however, in human medicine. Phages have been used against diarrheal diseases caused by &quot;E. coli&quot;, &quot;Shigella&quot;, or &quot;Vibrio&quot; and against wound infections caused by facultative pathogens of the skin like staphylococci and streptococci. Recently, the phage therapy approach has been applied to systemic and even intracellular infections, and non-replicating phage and isolated phage enzymes like lysins have been added to the antimicrobial arsenal. However, actual proof for the efficacy of these phage approaches in the field or the hospital is not available.

Some of the interest in the West can be traced back to 1994, when James Soothill demonstrated (in an animal model) that the use of phages could improve the success of skin grafts by reducing the underlying &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; infection. Recent studies have provided additional support for these findings in the model system.

Although not &quot;phage therapy&quot; in the original sense, the use of phages as delivery mechanisms for traditional antibiotics constitutes another possible therapeutic use. The use of phages to deliver antitumor agents has also been described in preliminary in vitro experiments for cells in tissue culture.

In June 2015, the European Medicines Agency hosted a one-day workshop on the therapeutic use of bacteriophages, and in July 2015, the US National Institutes of Health hosted a two-day workshop titled &quot;Bacteriophage Therapy: An Alternative Strategy to Combat Drug Resistance&quot;.

In January 2016, phages were used successfully at Yale University by Benjamin Chan to treat a chronic &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; infection in ophthalmologist Ali Asghar Khodadoust. This successful treatment of a life-threatening infection sparked a resurgence of interest in phage therapy in the United States.

In 2017, a pair of genetically engineered phages along with one naturally occurring (so-called &quot;phage Muddy&quot;) each from among those catalogued by SEA-PHAGES (Science Education Alliance-Phage Hunters Advancing Genomics and Evolutionary Science) at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute by Graham Hatfull and colleagues, was used by microbiologist James Soothill at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in London to treat an antibiotic-resistant bacterial (&quot;Mycobacterium abscessus&quot;) infection in a young woman with cystic fibrosis.

In 2022, two mycobacteriophages were administered intravenously twice daily to a young man with treatment-refractory &quot;Mycobacterium abscessus&quot; pulmonary infection and severe cystic fibrosis lung disease. Airway cultures for &quot;M. abscessus&quot; became negative after approximately 100 days of combined phage and antibiotic treatment, and a variety of biomarkers confirmed the therapeutic response. The individual received a bilateral lung transplant after 379 days of treatment, and cultures from the explanted lung tissue confirmed eradication of the bacteria. In a second case, successful treatment of disseminated cutaneous &quot;Mycobacterium chelonae&quot; was reported with a single phage administered intravenously twice daily in conjunction with antibiotic and surgical management.

==Potential benefits==
Bacteriophage treatment offers a possible alternative to conventional antibiotic treatments for bacterial infection. It is conceivable that, although bacteria can develop resistance to phages, the resistance might be easier to overcome than resistance to antibiotics. Viruses, just like bacteria, can evolve resistance to different treatments.

Bacteriophages are very specific, targeting only one or a few strains of bacteria. Traditional antibiotics have a more wide-ranging effect, killing both harmful and useful bacteria, such as those facilitating food digestion. The species and strain specificity of bacteriophages makes it unlikely that harmless or useful bacteria will be killed when fighting an infection.

A few research groups in the West are engineering a broader-spectrum phage and also a variety of forms of MRSA treatments, including impregnated wound dressings, preventative treatment for burn victims, and phage-impregnated sutures. Enzybiotics are a new development at Rockefeller University that create enzymes from phages. Purified recombinant phage enzymes can be used as separate antibacterial agents in their own right.

Phage therapy also has the potential to prevent or treat infectious diseases of corals. This could mitigate the global coral decline.

==Applications==
===Collection===
Phages for therapeutic use can be collected from environmental sources that likely contain high quantities of bacteria and bacteriophages, such as effluent outlets, sewage, or even soil. The samples are taken and applied to bacterial cultures that are to be targeted. If the bacteria die, the phages can be grown in liquid cultures.

===Modes of treatment===
Phages are &quot;bacterium-specific&quot;, and therefore, it is necessary in many cases to take a swab from the patient and culture it prior to treatment. Occasionally, isolation of therapeutic phages can require a few months to complete, but clinics generally keep supplies of phage cocktails for the most common bacterial strains in a geographical area.

Phage cocktails are commonly sold in pharmacies in Eastern European countries, such as Russia and Georgia. The composition of bacteriophagic cocktails has been periodically modified to add phages effective against emerging pathogenic strains.

Phages in practice are applied orally, topically on infected wounds or spread onto surfaces, or during surgical procedures. Injection is rarely used, avoiding any risks of trace chemical contaminants that may be present from the bacteria amplification stage, and recognizing that the immune system naturally fights against viruses introduced into the bloodstream or lymphatic system.

Reviews of phage therapy indicate that more clinical and microbiological research is needed to meet current standards.

===Clinical trials===
Funding for phage therapy research and clinical trials is generally insufficient and difficult to obtain, since it is a lengthy and complex process to patent bacteriophage products. Due to the specificity of phages, phage therapy would be most effective as a cocktail injection, a modality generally rejected by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Therefore, researchers and observers have predicted that if phage therapy is to gain traction, the FDA must change its regulatory stance on combination drug cocktails. Public awareness and education about phage therapy are generally limited to scientific or independent research rather than mainstream media.

In 2007, phase-1 and 2 clinical trials were completed at the Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital, London, for &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; infections (otitis).
Phase-1 clinical trials were conducted at the Southwest Regional Wound Care Center of Lubbock, Texas, for a cocktail of phages against &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot;, &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, and &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, developed by Intralytix. , a phase-1 and 2 trial of phage therapy against &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot; wound infection in France and Belgium in 2015–17, was terminated early due to lack of effectiveness.

Locus Biosciences has created a cocktail of three CRISPR-modified phages. A 2019 study examined its effectiveness against &quot;E. coli&quot; in the urinary tract, and a phase-1 trial was completed shortly before March 2021. In February 2019, the FDA approved the first clinical trial of intravenously administered phage therapy in the United States.

In July 2020, the FDA approved the first clinical trial of nebulized phage therapy in the United States. This double-blind, placebo-controlled study at Yale University will be focused on treating &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot; infections in patients with cystic fibrosis.

In February 2020, the FDA approved a clinical trial to evaluate bacteriophage therapy in patients with urinary tract infections. The study started in December 2020 and aims to identify ideal bacteriophage treatment regimens based on improvements in disease control rates.

In February 2021, the FDA approved a clinical trial to evaluate bacteriophage therapy in patients with chronic prosthetic joint infections (PJI). The study was to begin in October 2022 and be conducted by Adaptive Phage Therapeutics, in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic.

===Administration===
====As pills====
If administered as pills, phages can be freeze-dried; this procedure does not reduce efficiency. Temperature stability up to 55 °C and shelf lives of 14 months have been shown for some types of phages in pill form.

====Liquid====
Application in liquid form is possible, stored preferably in refrigerated vials. Oral administration works better when an antacid is included, as this increases the number of phages surviving passage through the stomach. Topical administration often involves application to gauzes that are laid on the area to be treated. Liquid bacteriophages are also utilized for local applications, such as wound dressings and topical treatments, as well as external administration, including sprays and rinses.

====Via nebulizer====
The July 2020 application for FDA approval for the first clinical trial of nebulized phage therapy in the United States does not specify a particular type of nebulizer, such as a compressor or ultrasound type. Bacteriophages are studied as potential candidates for treating bacterial lung infections, especially those caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. In these studies, bacteriophage solutions are administered via nebulizers, mostly using the compressor type. The stability and viability of phages during nebulization are crucial for their therapeutic efficacy. Current studies focus on whether phages can remain viable and effective when delivered via nebulizers. The choice of nebulizer can impact the stability and delivery efficiency of phages. Compressor nebulizers are commonly used because they generate a fine mist that can reach the lower respiratory tract.

In contrast to the compressor nebulizers, the ultrasound nebulizers can impact the viability of bacteriophages. The ultrasonic waves used to generate the aerosol can cause physical damage to the phages, potentially reducing their effectiveness. Preliminary research suggests the high-frequency vibrations and heat generated during the nebulization process can lead to a significant loss of phage activity. Consequently, one of the main challenges is ensuring that the phages remain undamaged during the nebulization process. Studies have shown that phages can be sensitive to the shear forces generated during nebulization. Still, with proper formulation and device selection, it is possible to maintain their viability, as the current research suggests.

===Successful treatments===
Phages were used successfully at Yale University by Benjamin Chan to treat a &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; infection in 2016. Intravenous phage drip therapy was successfully used to treat a patient with multidrug-resistant &quot;Acinetobacter baumannii&quot; in Thornton Hospital at UC San Diego in 2017. Nebulized phage therapy has been used successfully to treat numerous patients with cystic fibrosis and multidrug-resistant bacteria at Yale University as part of their compassionate use program. In 2019, a Brownsville, Minnesota resident with a longstanding bacterial infection in his knee received a phage treatment at the Mayo Clinic that eliminated the need for amputation of his lower leg. Individualised phage therapy was also successfully used by Robert T. Schooley and others to treat a case of multi-drug-resistant &quot;Acinetobacter baumannii&quot; in 2015. In 2022, an individually adjusted phage-antibiotic combination as an antimicrobial resistance treatment was demonstrated and described in detail. The scientists called for scaling up the research and for further development of this approach.

===Treatment of biofilm infections===
Phage therapy is being used to great effect in the treatment of biofilm infections, especially &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; and &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;. From 78 recent cases of treatment of biofilm infections, 96% of patients saw clinical improvement using phage therapy, and 52% of patients saw complete symptom relief or a full expungement of the affecting bacteria. Biofilm infections are very challenging to treat with antibiotics. The biofilm matrix and surrounding bacterial membranes can bind to the antibiotics, preventing them from penetrating the biofilm. The matrix may contain enzymes that deactivate antibiotics. Biofilms also have low metabolic activity, which means antibiotics that target growing processes have much lower efficacy. These factors make phage therapy an enticing option for the treatment of such infections, and there are currently two ways to go about such treatment. The first is to isolate the initial bacteria and make a specific treatment phage to target it, while the second way is to use a combination of more general phages. The advantage of the second method is that it can easily be made commercially available for treatment, although there are some concerns that it may be substantially less effective.

==Limitations==
The high bacterial strain specificity of phage therapy may make it necessary for clinics to make different cocktails for treatment of the same infection or disease, because the bacterial components of such diseases may differ from region to region or even person to person. In addition, this means that &quot;banks&quot; containing many different phages must be kept and regularly updated with new phages.

Further, bacteria can evolve different receptors either before or during treatment. This can prevent phages from completely eradicating them.

The need for banks of phages makes regulatory testing for safety harder and more expensive under current rules in most countries. Such a process would make the large-scale use of phage therapy difficult. Additionally, patent issues (specifically on living organisms) may complicate distribution for pharmaceutical companies wishing to have exclusive rights over their &quot;invention&quot;, which would discourage a commercial corporation from investing capital in this.

As has been known for at least thirty years, mycobacteria such as &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; have specific bacteriophages. No lytic phage has yet been discovered for &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;, which is responsible for many nosocomial diseases, but some temperate phages (integrated in the genome, also called lysogenic) are known for this species; this opens encouraging avenues but with additional risks, as discussed below.

The negative public perception of viruses may contribute to the reluctance to embrace phage therapy.

===Development of resistance===
One of the major concerns usually associated with phage therapy is the emergence of bacteriophage-insensitive mutants (BIMs) that could hinder the success of this therapy. Several in vitro studies have reported a fast emergence of BIMs within a short time after phage treatment. The emergence of BIMs has also been observed in vivo using different animal models, although this usually occurs later than in vitro (reviewed in ). This fast adaptation of bacteria to phage attack is usually caused by mutations on genes encoding phage receptors, which include lipopolysaccharides (LPS), outer membrane proteins, capsules, flagella, and pili, among others. However, some studies suggest that when phage resistance is caused by mutations in phage receptors, this might result in fitness costs to the resistance bacterium, which will ultimately become less virulent. Moreover, it has been shown that the evolution of bacterial resistance to phage attack changes the efflux pump mechanism, causing increased sensitivity to drugs from several antibiotic classes. Therefore, it is conceivable to think that phage therapy that uses phages that exert selection for multidrug-resistant bacteria to become antibiotic-sensitive could potentially reduce the incidence of antibiotic-resistant infections.

Besides the prevention of phage adsorption by loss or modification of bacterial receptors, phage insensitivity can be caused by: prevention of phage DNA entry by superinfection exclusion systems; or degradation of phage DNA by restriction-modification systems or by CRISPR-Cas systems; and use of abortive infection systems that block phage replication, transcription, or translation, usually in conjunction with suicide of the host cell. Altogether, these mechanisms promote a quick adaptation of bacteria to phage attack and therefore, the emergence of phage-resistant mutants is frequent and unavoidable.

It is still unclear whether the wide use of phages would cause resistance similar to what has been observed for antibiotics. In theory, this is not very likely to occur, since phages are very specific, and therefore, their selective pressure would affect a very narrow group of bacteria. However, we should also consider the fact that many phage resistance systems are mounted on mobile genetic elements, including prophages and plasmids, and thus may spread quite rapidly even without direct selection. Nevertheless, in contrast to antibiotics, phage preparations for therapeutic applications are expected to be developed in a personalized way because of the high specificity of phages. In addition, strategies have been proposed to counter the problem of phage resistance. One of the strategies is the use of phage cocktails with complementary host ranges (different host ranges, which, when combined, result in an overall broader host range) and targeting different bacterial receptors. Another strategy is the combination of phages with other antimicrobials such as antibiotics, disinfectants, or enzymes that could enhance their antibacterial activity. The genetic manipulation of phage genomes can also be a strategy to circumvent phage resistance.

==Safety aspects==
Bacteriophages are bacterial viruses, evolved to infect bacterial cells. To do that, phages must use characteristic structures at cell surfaces (receptors), and to propagate they need appropriate molecular tools inside the cells. Bacteria are prokaryotes, and their cells differ substantially from eukaryotes, including humans or animals. For this reason, phages meet the major safety requirement: they do not infect treated individuals. Even engineered phages and induced artificial internalization of phages into mammalian cells do not result in phage propagation. Natural transcytosis of unmodified phages, that is, uptake and internal transport to the other side of a cell, which was observed in human epithelial cells, did not result in phage propagation or cell damage. Recently, however, it was reported that filamentous temperate phages of &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot; can be endocytosed into human and murine leukocytes, resulting in transcription of the phage DNA. In turn, the product RNA triggers maladaptive innate viral pattern-recognition responses and thus inhibits the immune clearance of the bacteria. Whether this also applies to dsDNA phages like &quot;Caudovirales&quot; has not yet been established; this is an important question to be addressed as it may affect the overall safety of phage therapy.

Due to many experimental treatments in human patients conducted in past decades, and to already existing RCTs (see section: Clinical experience and randomized controlled trials), phage safety can be assessed directly. The first safety trial in healthy human volunteers for a phage was conducted by Bruttin and Brüssow in 2005. They investigated the oral administration of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; phage T4 and found no adverse effects of the treatment.

Historical record shows that phages are safe, with mild side effects, if any. Still, administering bacteriophages can induce an immune response. Macrophages, key cells of the innate immune system, play a central role in mediating this response. The most frequent (though still rare) adverse reactions to phage preparations found in patients were symptoms from the digestive tract, local reactions at the site of administration of a phage preparation, superinfections, and a rise in body temperature. These reactions might have occurred because either toxins were released from bacteria destroyed by the phages—such toxin release from bacteria can also happen with antibiotic use—or due to leftover bacterial fragments or residual components from the bacterial growth medium (&quot;food for bacteria&quot;) present in the phage treatment when unpurified preparations were used.

When bacteriophages are introduced into the body, they may be recognized as foreign entities by macrophages through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). The binding of bacteriophages to these receptors triggers macrophage activation, leading to phagocytosis (macrophages engulf and digest the bacteriophages) and cytokine production: activated macrophages produce pro-inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines can modulate the immune response but generally do not result in significant fever when phages are used appropriately.

The route by which bacteriophages enter the body can affect the degree of immune activation. Applying bacteriophages directly to the mucosa targets the site of infection with minimal systemic exposure, leading to a localized immune response. Injecting bacteriophages into muscle tissue introduces them to a larger number of macrophages in the muscle and regional lymph nodes. In intravenous injection, direct introduction into the bloodstream exposes bacteriophages to macrophages throughout the body, including those in the spleen and liver. However, significant elevations in body temperature are uncommon and typically only observed in cases of rapid phage administration or high doses. Anticipating immune responses allows healthcare professionals to monitor patients appropriately and make treatment adjustments if necessary. Macrophages are integral to the body&#x27;s immune response to bacteriophage therapy, mediating any potential immune reactions. Intravenous administration of bacteriophages is conducted under strict medical supervision, by specialists in infectious diseases within a hospital setting, due to potential adverse reactions. Adverse reactions to intravenous bacteriophage therapy may include hypotension, i.e., a drop in blood pressure, leading to loss of consciousness. A sudden drop (chills) and rise (fever) in body temperature, known as the Jarisch–Herxheimer reaction, can occur due to the rapid lysis of bacteria and release of endotoxins. Rapid bacterial lysis releases endotoxins (e.g., lipopolysaccharides from gram-negative bacteria) that trigger systemic inflammatory responses, including &quot;cytokine storms&quot;. Continuous monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature to detect early signs of adverse reactions is done after the intravenous phage administration. Successful treatment of life-threatening infections with intravenous phage therapy has been documented. Patients have responded to therapy after one or several intravenous administrations, clearing infections that were unresponsive to conventional treatments: phages can disrupt biofilms, which are often resistant to antibiotics, enhancing infection clearance.

Bacteriophages must be produced in bacteria that are lysed (i.e., fragmented) during phage propagation. As such, phage lysates contain bacterial debris that may affect the human organism even when the phage itself is harmless. For these and other reasons, purification of bacteriophages is considered important, and phage preparations need to be assessed for their safety as a whole, particularly when phages are to be administered intravenously. This is consistent with general procedures for other drug candidates. In 2015, a group of phage therapy experts summarized the quality and safety requirements for sustainable phage therapy.

Phage effects on the human microbiome also contribute to safety issues in phage therapy. Many phages, especially temperate ones, carry genes that can affect the pathogenicity of the host. Even lambda, a temperate phage of the &quot;E. coli&quot; K-12 laboratory strain, carries two genes that provide potential virulence benefits to the lysogenic host, one that increases intestinal adherence and the other that confers resistance to complement killing in the blood. For this reason, temperate phages are generally to be avoided as candidates for phage therapy, although in some cases, the lack of lytic phage candidates and emergency conditions may make such considerations moot. Another potential problem is generalized transduction, a term for the ability of some phages to transfer bacterial DNA from one host to another. This occurs because the systems for packaging of the phage DNA into capsids can mistakenly package host DNA instead. Indeed, with some well-characterized phages, up to 5% of the virus particles contain only bacterial DNA. Thus in a typical lysate, the entire genome of the propagating host is present in more than a million copies in every milliliter. For these reasons, it is imperative that any phage to be considered for therapeutic usage should be subjected to thorough genomic analysis and tested for the capacity for generalized transduction.

As antibacterials, phages may also affect the composition of microbiomes, by infecting and killing phage-sensitive strains of bacteria. However, a major advantage of bacteriophages over antibiotics is the high specificity of bacteriophages. This specificity limits antibacterial activity to a sub-species level; typically, a phage kills only selected bacterial strains. For this reason, phages are much less likely (than antibiotics) to disturb the composition of a natural microbiome or to induce dysbiosis. This was demonstrated in experimental studies where microbiome composition was assessed by next-generation sequencing that revealed no important changes correlated with phage treatment in human treatments.

Much of the difficulty in obtaining regulatory approval is proving to be the risks of using a self-replicating entity that has the capability to evolve.

As with antibiotic therapy and other methods of countering bacterial infections, endotoxins are released by the bacteria as they are destroyed within the patient (Jarisch–Herxheimer reaction). This can cause symptoms of fever; in extreme cases, toxic shock (a problem also seen with antibiotics) is possible. Janakiraman Ramachandran argues that this complication can be avoided in those types of infection where this reaction is likely to occur by using genetically engineered bacteriophages that have had their gene responsible for producing endolysin removed. Without this gene, the host bacterium still dies but remains intact, because the lysis is disabled. On the other hand, this modification stops the exponential growth of phages, so one administered phage means at most one dead bacterial cell. Eventually, these dead cells are consumed by the normal house-cleaning duties of the phagocytes, which utilize enzymes to break down the whole bacterium and its contents into harmless proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids.

Temperate (or lysogenic) bacteriophages are not generally used therapeutically, since this group can act as a way for bacteria to exchange DNA. This can help spread antibiotic resistance or even, theoretically, make the bacteria pathogenic, such as in cases of cholera. Carl Merril has claimed that harmless strains of &quot;corynebacterium&quot; may have been converted into &quot;C. diphtheriae&quot; that &quot;probably killed a third of all Europeans who came to North America in the seventeenth century&quot;. Fortunately, many phages seem to be lytic only with negligible probability of becoming lysogenic.

==Regulation and legislation==
Approval of phage therapy for use in humans has not been given in Western countries, with a few exceptions. In the United States, Washington and Oregon law allows naturopathic physicians to use any therapy that is legal anywhere in the world on an experimental basis, and in Texas, phages are considered natural substances and can be used in addition to (but not as a replacement for) traditional therapy (they have been used routinely in a wound care clinic in Lubbock since 2006).

In 2013, &quot;the 20th biennial Evergreen International Phage Meeting ... conference drew 170 participants from 35 countries, including leaders of companies and institutes involved with human phage therapies from France, Australia, Georgia, Poland, and the United States.&quot;

In France, phage therapy disappeared officially with the withdrawal of the Vidal dictionary (France&#x27;s official drug directory), in 1978. The last phage preparation, produced by l&#x27;Institut du Bactériophage, was an ointment against skin infections. Phage therapy research ceased at about the same time across the country, with the closure of the bacteriophage department at the Pasteur Institute. Some hospital physicians continued to offer phage therapy until the 1990s, when production died out.

On their rediscovery, at the end of the 1990s, phage preparations were classified as medicines, i.e., &quot;medicinal products&quot; in the EU or &quot;drugs&quot; in the US. However, the pharmaceutical legislation that had been implemented since their disappearance from Western medicine was mainly designed to cater for industrially-made pharmaceuticals, devoid of any customization and intended for large-scale distribution, and it was not deemed necessary to provide phage-specific requirements or concessions.

Today&#x27;s phage therapy products need to comply with the entire battery of medicinal product licensing requirements: manufacturing according to GMP, preclinical studies, phase I, II, and III clinical trials, and marketing authorisation. Technically, industrially produced predefined phage preparations could make it through the conventional pharmaceutical processes, minding some adaptations. However, phage specificity and resistance issues are likely to cause these defined preparations to have a relatively short useful lifespan. The pharmaceutical industry is currently not considering phage therapy products. Yet, a handful of small and medium-sized enterprises have shown interest, with the help of risk capital and/or public funding. Currently, no defined therapeutic phage product has made it to the EU or US markets.

According to Jean-Paul Pirnay, therapeutic phages should be prepared individually and kept in large phage banks, ready to be used, upon testing for effectiveness against the patient&#x27;s bacterial pathogen(s). Intermediary or combined (industrially made as well as precision phage preparations) approaches could be appropriate. However, it turns out to be difficult to reconcile classical phage therapy concepts, which are based on the timely adaptation of phage preparations, with current Western pharmaceutical R&amp;D and marketing models. Repeated calls for a specific regulatory framework have not been heeded by European policymakers. A phage therapy framework based on the Biological Master File concept has been proposed as a (European) solution to regulatory issues, but European regulations do not allow for an extension of this concept to biologically active substances such as phages.

Meanwhile, representatives from the medical, academic, and regulatory communities have established some (temporary) national solutions. For instance, phage applications have been performed in Europe under the umbrella of Article 37 (Unproven Interventions in Clinical Practice) of the Helsinki Declaration. To enable the application of phage therapy after Poland had joined the EU in 2004, the Ludwik Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy in Wrocław opened its own Phage Therapy Unit (PTU). Phage therapy performed at the PTU is considered an &quot;experimental treatment&quot;, covered by the adapted Act of 5 December 1996 on the Medical Profession (Polish Law Gazette, 2011, No. 277 item 1634) and Article 37 of the Helsinki Declaration. Similarly, in the last few years, a number of phage therapy interventions have been performed in the US under the FDA&#x27;s emergency Investigational New Drug (eIND) protocol.

Some patients have been treated with phages under the umbrella of &quot;compassionate use&quot;, which is a treatment option that allows a physician to use a not-yet-authorized medicine in desperate cases. Under strict conditions, medicines under development can be made available for use in patients for whom no satisfactory authorized therapies are available and who cannot participate in clinical trials. In principle, this approach can only be applied to products for which earlier study results have demonstrated efficacy and safety, but have not yet been approved. Much like Article 37 of the Helsinki Declaration, the compassionate use treatment option can only be applied when the phages are expected to help in life-threatening or chronic and/or seriously debilitating diseases that are not treatable with formally approved products.

In France, ANSM, the French medicine agency, has organized a specific committee—Comité Scientifique Spécialisé Temporaire (CSST)—for phage therapy, which consists of experts in various fields. Their task is to evaluate and guide each phage therapy request that ends up at the ANSM. Phage therapy requests are discussed together with the treating physicians and consensus advice is sent to the ANSM], which then decides whether or not to grant permission. Between 2006 and 2018, fifteen patients were treated in France (eleven recovered) using this pathway.

In Belgium, in 2016 and in response to a number of parliamentary questions, Maggie De Block, the Minister of Social Affairs and Health, acknowledged that it is indeed not evident to treat phages as industrially made drugs, and therefore she proposed to investigate if the magistral preparation pathway could offer a solution. Magistral preparations (compounding pharmacies in the US) are not subjected to certain constraints such as GMP compliance and marketing authorization. As the &quot;magistral preparation framework&quot; was created to allow for adapted patient treatments and/or to use medicines for which there is no commercial interest, it seemed a suitable framework for precision phage therapy concepts. Magistral preparations are medicines prepared in a pharmacy in accordance with a medical prescription for an individual patient. They are made by a pharmacist (or under his/her supervision) from their constituent ingredients, according to the technical and scientific standards of pharmaceutical technology. Phage active pharmaceutical ingredients to be included in magistral preparations must meet the requirements of a monograph, which describes their production and quality control testing. They must be accompanied by a certificate of analysis, issued by a &quot;Belgian Approved Laboratory&quot;, which has been granted an accreditation to perform batch-release testing of medicinal products. Since 2019, phages have been delivered in the form of magistral preparations to nominal patients in Belgium.

The first phage therapy case in China can be traced back to 1958, at Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. However, many regulations were not yet established back then, and phage therapy soon lost people&#x27;s interest due to the prevalence of antibiotics, which eventually led to the antimicrobial resistance crisis. This prompted researchers in China as well as the Chinese government to pay attention to phage therapy again, and following the first investigator-initiated trial (IIT) by the Shanghai Institute of Phage in 2019, phage therapy rapidly flourished. Currently, commercial phage therapy applications must go through either one of two pathways. The first is for fixed-ingredient phage products. The second pathway is for personalized phage products, which need to go through IITs. This way, the products are considered restrictive medical technologies.

==Application in other species==
===Animals===
Phage therapy has been a relevant mode of treatment in animals for decades. It has been proposed as a method of treating bacterial infections in the veterinary medical field in response to the rampant use of antibiotics. Studies have investigated the application of phage therapy in livestock species as well as companion animals. Brigham Young University has been researching the use of phage therapy to treat American foulbrood in honeybees. Phage therapy is also being investigated for potential applications in aquaculture.

===Plants===
Phage therapy has been studied for bacterial spot of stonefruit, caused by &quot;Xanthomonas pruni&quot; (syn. &quot;X. campestris&quot; pv. &quot;pruni&quot;, syn. &quot;X. arboricola&quot; pv. &quot;pruni&quot;) in &quot;prunus&quot; species. Some treatments have been very successful.

==Cultural impact==
The 1925 novel and 1926 Pulitzer Prize winner &quot;Arrowsmith&quot; by Sinclair Lewis used phage therapy as a plot point.

Greg Bear&#x27;s 2002 novel &quot;Vitals&quot; features phage therapy, based on Soviet research, used to transfer genetic material.

The 2012 collection of military history essays about the changing role of women in warfare, &quot;Women in War – From Home Front to Front Line&quot; includes a chapter featuring phage therapy: &quot;Chapter 17: Women who thawed the Cold War&quot;.

Steffanie A. Strathdee&#x27;s book &quot;The Perfect Predator: An Epidemiologist&#x27;s Journey to Save Her Husband from a Deadly Superbug&quot;, co-written with her husband, Thomas Patterson, was published by Hachette Book Group in 2019. It describes Strathdee&#x27;s ultimately successful attempt to introduce phage therapy as a life-saving treatment for her husband, critically ill with a completely antibiotic-resistant &quot;Acinetobacter baumannii&quot; infection following severe pancreatitis.

<text>Menace II Society (pronounced Menace to Society) is a 1993 American teen crime drama film directed by the Hughes Brothers in their directorial debut. Set in the Watts and Crenshaw neighborhoods of Los Angeles, the film follows the life of Caine Lawson (Tyrin Turner) and his close friends. It gained notoriety for its scenes of violence, profanity, and drug-related content, and also received critical acclaim for the performances of Turner, Jada Pinkett (in her film debut), and Larenz Tate, the direction, and its realistic portrayal of urban violence and powerful underlying messages.

==Plot==
Kaydee &quot;Caine&quot; Lawson and his best friend Kevin &quot;O-Dog&quot; Anderson enter a liquor store to buy some malt liquor, but a Korean cashier and his wife closely watch and hurry them to buy their drinks and leave. As they leave, the cashier tells O-Dog &quot;I feel sorry for your mother.&quot; Enraged, O-Dog kills both the cashier and his wife. O-Dog subsequently takes the surveillance tape, robs the dead cashier&#x27;s wallet and the cash register, and flees with Caine. Caine recalls losing his parents Tat and Karen when he was 10 to an unsuccessful drug deal, and a heroin overdose respectively. Pernell, Tat&#x27;s business partner and Caine&#x27;s mentor, is jailed and serving life in prison. This led to Caine&#x27;s maternal grandparents raising him in the crime-ridden Jordan Downs housing projects.

Years later, Caine graduates high school. To celebrate, Caine and his cousin Harold attend a party, where O-Dog flaunts the surveillance tape to a group of their closest friends, much to Caine&#x27;s dismay. Later, when the cousins leave the party, they are carjacked. The carjackers kill Harold and wound Caine. After learning the carjackers&#x27; whereabouts, Caine, O-Dog, and their friend A-Wax locate and execute them, avenging Harold&#x27;s death.

Sometime later, Caine visits Ronnie, Pernell&#x27;s girlfriend, forms a bond with her son Anthony and ensures Ronnie is financially secure. One night, Chauncey (a friend of Caine and O-Dog), tasks Caine and O-Dog with stealing a car from a parking garage, but are arrested. O-Dog is released, but Caine is detained as his fingerprints match those on a dropped beer bottle during the liquor store murders. During an interrogation, a detective tries tricking Caine by changing the questions multiple times, but Caine is eventually released. Caine&#x27;s religious grandfather and Mr. Butler (Sharif&#x27;s father and a school teacher) give Caine advice to change his ways and warn him about being jailed or killed. Caine&#x27;s other friends Stacy and Sharif try to convince Caine to accompany them to Kansas, but fail. Caine, nonetheless, ignores all advice.

Influenced by his late parents’ and Pernell&#x27;s lifestyle of drugs and crime, Caine begins purchasing and cooking large amounts of crack cocaine, soon becoming a hustler. He meets a local girl named Ilena and has sex with her. One night, he and Sharif are stopped and assaulted by cops, who then dump them in a Hispanic neighborhood to be further assaulted by Hispanic gang members. Instead, the gang members take them to a hospital. During his hospitalization, Ronnie invites Caine to accompany her to her new secretarial job in Atlanta. Initially hesitant, he ultimately agrees. At a party, Caine witnesses a drunk Chauncey making sexual advances towards Ronnie. Angered, Caine pistol whips Chauncey, and is soon restrained by Stacy and Sharif. Chauncey retaliates by sending his copy of the surveillance tape to the police. Ilena calls Caine about her pregnancy, but he denies paternity and rejects her.

Ronnie and Caine visit Pernell in prison. Pernell encourages an emotional Caine to be a more positive influence for Anthony and relocate to Atlanta. Afterwards, Caine returns home when Ilena&#x27;s cousin approaches him outside his house. An argument about Ilena and her pregnancy ensues, causing Caine to brutally stomp on Ilena&#x27;s cousin in front of his onlooking neighbors. Caine&#x27;s grandfather promptly comes outside, stops Caine and brings him inside. Finally having enough of Caine&#x27;s violent, trouble-prone ways, Caine&#x27;s grandparents kick Caine out of their house and dismiss Caine&#x27;s plea to stay until he leaves for Atlanta. Learning from their friend Doc of Chauncey&#x27;s betrayal, a now-wanted Caine and O-Dog seek refuge at Ronnie&#x27;s and other friends&#x27; houses. O-Dog vows revenge on Chauncey while Ilena&#x27;s cousin gathers his friends to seek revenge on Caine.

As Caine and Ronnie prepare to leave for Atlanta, Ilena&#x27;s cousin and his friends drive by Ronnie&#x27;s house and engage in a drive-by shootout, instantly killing Sharif and fatally wounding Caine as he shields Anthony. After the shootout, Stacy and Ronnie emerge from the house, respectively tending to Caine and Anthony. As Caine&#x27;s life flashes before him, he recalls his grandfather asking him if he cares whether he lives or dies, and he realizes in his dying moment that he does.

==Production==

New Line Cinema announced the film on July 27, 1992. Rappers Spice 1 and Tupac Shakur were initially set to play Caine and Sharif respectively. Originally, rapper MC Ren was set to play A-Wax, but later turned down the role when he joined the Nation of Islam in late 1992. MC Eiht replaced MC Ren&#x27;s role as A-Wax. The Hughes brothers were hired to direct the film after working with Shakur in the music video for &quot;Brenda&#x27;s Got a Baby.&quot; 

In 2023, Allen Hughes claimed that Eazy-E was initially supposed to play O-Dog. However, this would never happen as Hughes deemed Eazy-E &quot;controlling.&quot;

Principal photography began in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles, with residents of Jordan Downs appearing as extras and the Grape Street Watts Crips working as security. However, Tupac and Spice 1 were fired shortly into filming, with director Allen Hughes stating that Shakur was causing trouble on the set. Shakur was angry for not being told why Sharif would turn Muslim. When Shakur was cast in the role of Sharif, described in the film as &quot;an ex-knucklehead turned Muslim&quot;, he did not agree with how the character was written. While many of his rap music contemporaries were portraying roles similar to their gangsta rap personas, Sharif would have required Shakur to portray the character as a stoic and pious Muslim. According to MC Eiht, who played A-Wax in the film:

Six months after the firing, Shakur assaulted Hughes, resulting in Shakur being found guilty of assault and battery. Nonetheless, after Tupac&#x27;s death, Allen Hughes praised the actor, stating &quot;If &#x27;Pac had been in the movie he would&#x27;ve outshined everyone.&quot;

== Reception ==
&quot;Menace II Society&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. The film has an 85% approval score on Rotten Tomatoes based on 46 reviews, with an average rating of 7.40/10. The consensus reads, &quot;Told with grit and verve by the Hughes brothers in their feature debut, &quot;Menace II Society&quot; is a gangland epic that breathes with authenticity while steeped in style.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a weighted average score of 76 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

&quot;Chicago Reader&quot; critic Jonathan Rosenbaum stated, &quot;This is a powerful, convincing, and terrifying look at teenage crime in contemporary Watts.&quot; Owen Gleiberman from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it a positive review, stating, &quot;&quot;Menace II Society&quot; is bleak, brilliant, and unsparing.&quot;

Emanuel Levy gave the film an A, saying it is &quot;The most stunning feature debut in the new African American cinema, even more so than &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot; to which the coming of age feature bears thematic resemblance.&quot; The film was placed on both Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert&#x27;s 10 best films of 1993 lists, with Ebert praising &quot;the way the filmmakers tell Caine&#x27;s story without making him seem either the hero or victim&quot;.

However, the film has also received some negative reviews. Geoff Andrew of &quot;Time Out&quot; stated, &quot;Regrettably, the Hughes Brothers&#x27; first feature is a compendium of clichés.&quot; Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated, &quot;If &quot;Menace II Society&quot; is terrific on ambiance, it is considerably less successful in revealing character.&quot; At the 1994 MTV Movie Awards, the film was awarded Best Movie, beating out the likes of &quot;Philadelphia&quot;,&quot; Jurassic Park&quot; and &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;. At the Independent Spirit Award, The film had nominated an for Best First Feature, but lost to &quot;El Mariachi&quot; (the first installment in the Robert Rodriguez&#x27;s &quot;Mexico Trilogy&quot;).

The film grossed $27.9 million in the United States and Canada and $1.6 million internationally for a worldwide total of $29.5 million.

<text>The Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC) is an international standardized test of English language proficiency for non-native speakers. It is intentionally designed to measure the everyday English skills of people working in an international environment.

There are different forms of the exam: the TOEIC Listening &amp; Reading Test consists of two equally graded tests of comprehension assessment activities totaling a possible 990 score; there are also the TOEIC Speaking and Writing tests. The TOEIC Speaking test is composed of tasks that assess pronunciation, intonation and stress, vocabulary, grammar, cohesion, relevance of content, and completeness of content. The TOEIC Writing test is composed of tasks that assess grammar, relevance of sentences to the pictures, quality and variety of sentences, vocabulary, organization, and whether opinions are supported with reason and/or examples. Both the Speaking and Writing assessments use a score scale of 0–200.

==History==
The basic idea of the TOEIC test was conceived by , a retired &quot;Time&quot; magazine staff member who noticed a lack of English communication ability among the Japanese population.

He proposed the idea to the US-based Educational Testing Service (ETS), but the organization rejected him since they preferred to collaborate with nonprofit organizations. He also failed to convince the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, who had already launched STEP Eiken. Instead, Kitaoka found his close friend , a retired official from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, to support him.

Kitaoka and Watanabe later established (WEIS), thus enabling Kitaoka to collaborate with ETS. WEIS later established a committee to developed TOEIC. The first TOEIC test was launched in 1979 and taken by 3,000 individuals.

In 1986, a newly created organization, the (IIBC), took over the administration of the TOEIC from WEIS. In 2006, ETS released a new version of the TOEIC test.

ETS&#x27;s major competitors are Cambridge University, which administers the IELTS, FCE, CAE, and CPE, and Trinity College London, which administers the GESE and ISE exams.

==Formats and content==

===TOEIC Listening &amp; Reading Test===

The TOEIC Listening &amp; Reading Test lasts two hours; 45 minutes for Listening, and 75 minutes for Reading. It consists of 200 multiple-choice items evenly divided between the listening and reading comprehension section. Each question is worth five points. Each candidate receives independent scores for listening and reading comprehension on a scale from 0 to 495 points. The total score adds up to a scale from 0 to 990 points. The TOEIC certificate exists in five colors, corresponding to the results achieved:
* orange (0–219)
* brown (220–469)
* green (470–729)
* blue (730–859)
* gold (860–990)

TOEIC test certificates are optional, unofficial documents that are meant for display only.

====2006 redesigned TOEIC tests====

A new version of the TOEIC Listening &amp; Reading test was released in 2006. The changes can be summarized as follows:
*Overall, passages are longer.
*Part 1 has fewer questions involving photograph descriptions.
*The Listening Section hires speakers of English from Britain, Australia, New Zealand and North America, and uses an equal distribution of the dialects. However, all the voice actors for the audio sections have lived in the United States for an extended period.
*Part 6 no longer contains an error-spotting task, criticized as unrealistic in a corporate environment, instead adopting the use of a task wherein the test taker fills in blanks in incomplete sentences.
*Part 7 contains not only single-passage questions, but also double- and triple-passage questions wherein the test taker reads and compares two or three related passages, such as an e-mail correspondence.

According to a survey conducted in 2006 by , 56.8% of the respondents who took both the older and the revised versions of the TOEIC test in Japan find the latter version more difficult. The lower the score the test taker achieves, the more marked this tendency becomes. As many as 85.6% of those who earned scores ranging from 0 to 395 points find the revised TOEIC test more difficult, while 69.9% of those who earned 400 to 495 points think this way, as do 59.3% of those who earned 500 to 595 points. Among those who achieved 600 to 695 points, 58.9% agreed with these findings; 48.6% of those who scored 700 to 795 points agreed; 47.9% of those who scored 800 to 895 points agreed; and 39.8% of those who scored 900 to 990 points agreed.

2006 also saw the addition of TOEIC Speaking &amp; Writing tests. In 2007 there were additional changes to the TOEIC Reading &amp; Listening test that decreased emphasis on knowledge of grammatical rules.

=====Test scores in redesigned TOEIC=====

Scores on the TOEIC Listening and Reading test are determined by the number of correct answers. The number of correct responses on each section is multiplied by five and converted to a scaled score. Three TOEIC Listening and Reading scaled scores are given for each examinee:

*οne for the Listening Section
*οne for the Reading Section
*οne Total Score that consists of the sum of the Listening Section and Reading Section sub-scores.

Each sub-score can range from 0 to 495 points. The Total Score ranges from 0 to 990. There is no negative scoring. The Total Score consists of the sum of the Listening Section and Reading Section sub-scores.

====2016 updated TOEIC L&amp;R tests====

In 2016, a new version of the TOEIC test was released in Japan and South Korea, including new types of questions. The updated TOEIC test became available worldwide in 2018.

Some of the changes to the test are as follows: 

Listening:
*Number of photograph and question response questions decreased, number of conversation questions increased instead 
*3 or more speakers in some conversations
*Shorter turns and more exchanges in some conversations
*Colloquial phases (e.g., &quot;gonna&quot;) and incomplete sentences/fragments (e.g., &quot;Yes, in a minute&quot;) in conversations
*New question types include:
**Identifying information using a graphic (a table, graph, etc.)
**Understanding the implied meaning of speakers within a conversation

Reading:
*Number of incomplete sentence filling questions decreased
*Addition of long text completion (fill-in-the-blank) questions
*New question type to test the understanding of three related passages
*Text messages, instant messages, or online chat conversations with multiple speakers

Despite these changes, the update to the test came with no change to score scale, test difficulty, number of items, or test length, according to ETS. 

===TOEIC Speaking &amp; Writing Test===

The TOEIC Speaking &amp; Writing Tests were introduced in 2006. Test takers receive separate scores for each of the two tests, or they can take the Speaking test without taking the Writing test and vice versa. The Speaking test assesses pronunciation, intonation and stress, vocabulary, grammar, cohesion, relevance of content, and completeness of content; while the Writing test assesses grammar, relevance of sentences to the pictures, quality and variety of sentences, vocabulary, organization, and whether the opinion is supported with reason and/or examples. The tests are designed to reflect actual English usage in the workplace, though they do not require any knowledge of specialized business terms. The TOEIC Speaking Test takes approximately 20 minutes to complete; the TOEIC Writing Test lasts approximately 60 minutes. Each test has a score range between 0–200, with test takers grouped into eight proficiency levels for Speaking and nine proficiency levels for Writing.

===Test accommodations===

Below are the types of accommodations commonly given:

* extended testing time
* additional rest breaks
* reader
* scribe
* recorder to mark answers
* headphones
* alternate test formats, e.g. Braille, enlarged print
* alternate response formats, e.g. computer for writing section
* wheelchair access

===TOEIC Bridge Test===
ETS also administers another version of the TOEIC test called the TOEIC Bridge. The TOEIC Bridge test targets beginning and intermediate learners and consists of 100 multiple-choice questions, requiring about one hour of testing time.

==By country==

===Chile===
The TOEIC Bridge was used in Chile as part of the 2010 SIMCE test.

===Europe===
In France, some &quot;grandes écoles&quot; require a TOEIC score of at least 785 for a diploma. This policy has been criticized, as it makes state-awarded diplomas dependent on a private institution, despite the fact that it was not the private institution that set the 785 mark but a recommendation from the &quot;Commission des titres d&#x27;ingénieur&quot; indicating a B2+ level on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages.
Students who fail to achieve a 785 score may validate their diplomas by other means in most schools. Some institutions delay awarding diplomas for one year after the end of studies in such cases.

In Greece, the TOEIC is accepted by ASEP, the organization responsible for hiring new employees to work for the government. It is administered by the Hellenic American Union and offered weekly in most major cities in Greece.

===Japan===
The administers the TOEIC test in Japan, where nearly 2.4 million people (as of 2014) take the test; 1.3M for institutional program (IP) and 1.1M for secure program (SP).

There are two ways to take the TOEIC test properly. One is called the , in which one can take the test individually or in a group on specified dates at a test center specified by the TOEIC Steering Committee. The other is the , in which an organization can choose the date and administer the test at its convenience in accordance with the TOEIC Steering Committee. The TOEIC SP Test was renewed in May 2006, followed by the TOEIC IP Test in April 2007 in line so that it would be with the SP Test.

More and more companies use TOEIC scores for personnel assessment instead of the homegrown STEP Eiken test organized by the . The TOEIC Speaking Test/Writing Test started on January 21, 2007, in addition to the TOEIC SP Test and the TOEIC IP Test.

====Scandal====
The Institute for International Business Communication (IIBC), the non-profit organization that administers the TOEIC in Japan, was the subject of a scandal in 2009.

In May and June 2009, articles in the Japanese weekly magazine &quot;FRIDAY&quot; accused the IIBC&#x27;s 92-year-old chairman Yaeji Watanabe of nepotism when he appointed his girlfriend&#x27;s son to the position of chairman of the IIBC board of directors. To force the appointment, half of the volunteers serving on the board were driven out by Watanabe. The magazine article also questioned why Watanabe only showed up for work about one day a week.

In his defense, Watanabe claimed that he held a ceremonial title and was chairman in name only. As a result, Watanabe claimed that he had little to do with the decision to appoint his girlfriend&#x27;s son to the position. The magazine article concluded by asking why someone who is chairman in name only and works only one day a week should receive an annual salary in excess of 25 million yen (approximately US$300,000).

In August 2009, the online version of the English-language newspaper &quot;The Japan Times&quot; published a two-part series examining the TOEIC&#x27;s origins and early history as well as the use of test-taker fees by the IIBC on the internet. The August 18 article examined the questionable uses of test fees, including a fivefold increase in utility expenses in one year, 13 million spent annually on research about adapting to Chinese culture, sponsorship of poetry readings by the Chinese Poetry Recitation Association, and membership fees to join the Beautiful Aging Association, for which Watanabe happened to be chairman.

The article also questioned the relationship between the IIBC and its for-profit partner International Communications School with which it shared office space. International Communications School is responsible for selling the TOEIC Institutional Program Test given by companies and schools; publishes IIBC-approved TOEIC preparation textbooks; and administers the TOEIC Japanese language website. One of International Communications School&#x27;s subsidiaries is E-Communications, which administers the TOEIC&#x27;s online application system and provides online TOEIC study materials.

In 2009, Watanabe suddenly resigned from the IIBC, leaving his girlfriend&#x27;s son in charge of the non-profit. Watanabe received a 25 million yen retirement payment.

The IIBC lowered the price of the TOEIC Secure Program Test from 6,615 yen to 5,985 yen starting with the September 13, 2009 test. The price had to be lowered due to pressure from the Ministry of Trade, which instructed the IIBC to reduce the profits being generated by the test.

In July 2010, the Tokyo Tax Bureau announced that International Communications School, IIBC&#x27;s for-profit partner, hid 100 million yen in income and had to pay 30 million yen in back taxes and fines.

===South Korea===
Historically, the International Communication Foundation (), a subsidiary of the language education company YBM Sisa (currently YBM Inc.), administered TOEIC tests in Korea from 1982 to 2006. Its role as administrator was transferred to the Korea TOEIC Committee (), another YBM subsidiary, in 2006.

TOEIC is one of the most well-known and popular English tests in Korea, and many universities and companies require TOEIC scores for graduation or job applications. According to the Committee, more than 2 million people took the exam in 2013 alone in the country.

Toward the end of 2005, there was a shift in South Korea, regarded as the second biggest consumer of the TOEIC per capita. However, a person&#x27;s TOEIC score is still a major factor in hiring people for most professional jobs in South Korea.
Starting in 2011, Korean universities were no longer permitted to use TOEIC and TOEFL scores as part of the admission process. However, many universities in Korea still require a minimum score of 900. Thus, many universities in Korea require TOEIC scores for graduation or selection of overseas trainees. This is apparently to discourage private English education (there are many private institutions that teach TOEIC-based classes). TEPS, another English proficiency test (developed by Seoul National University, Chosun Ilbo), has been created as an alternative to TOEIC tests. However, it is considered unlikely to replace the status of TOEIC.

===Taiwan===
Chun Shin Limited () administers the TOEIC test in Taiwan. In 2003, the Ministry of Education introduced English Graduation Benchmark Policy (EGB), enforcing universities in Taiwan to set English requirements for undergraduates. TOEIC benefited from this policy and its lower registration fees, and became a popular test for English proficiency in Taiwan. TOEIC has also became a widespread measurement of Taiwanese People&#x27;s English ability. For example, Rosalia Wu, a member of the Legislative Yuan, used the TOEIC score to advocate English as an official language.

The policy sparked controversies for various reasons. For the TOEIC, educators were concerned about undergraduates&#x27; economic burden from the TOEIC registration fee and the conflict of interest between universities and the company operating TOEIC.

In 2016, a National Chengchi University (NCCU) student sued NCCU to challenge the EGB policy. In September 2018, the Supreme Administrative Court ordered the policy to be discarded, while the NCCU abolished the policy in January.

===Thailand===
The Center for Professional Assessment offers regular institutional testing every Monday through Saturday at 9:00AM and 1:00PM (local time).

===United Kingdom===
The TOEIC was a Home Office-accredited test for students applying for a UK visa.

In 2014, an undercover investigation by the BBC program &quot;Panorama&quot; exposed systematic cheating and fraud by a number of organizations and individuals involved in running the test. Cheating was found to take place at Eden College International in London, where freelance invigilators used to conduct the exam. The college claimed no prior knowledge of the cheating, and had previously sacked three invigilators. ETS stated it does not hire the invigilators and that it does everything it can to prevent cheating.

On 17 April 2014, ETS decided not to renew its license as a provider of a Secure English Language Test (SELT). This means that these English language tests are no longer honored for the purpose of being issued a UK visa.

In June 2014, the Home Office undertook its own investigation and claimed to have found 46,000 &quot;invalid and questionable&quot; tests. It suspended the TOEIC exam as being valid for entry to the UK. It also canceled the visas of around 45,000 students, seventy percent of whom were Indian. Some left voluntarily, but the majority were deported.

In March 2016, a tribunal ruled that the evidence the Home Office used to deport the students was not strong enough. , over 300 legal appeals against the government were pending, and the National Audit Office had opened an investigation into the government&#x27;s handling of the issue, which some Members of Parliament had likened to the Windrush scandal.

===United States===
Both the TOEIC Listening &amp; Reading and the TOEIC Speaking &amp; Writing tests are now available in the United States. While the TOEIC Listening &amp; Reading test has been available for decades, the TOEIC Speaking &amp; Writing test was introduced in the United States only in 2009. Registration for the TOEIC Speaking &amp; Writing test is handled by the English4Success division of the nonprofit organization Amideast.

<text>A water jacket is a water-filled casing surrounding a device, typically a metal sheath having intake and outlet vents to allow water to be pumped through and circulated. The flow of water to an external heating or cooling device allows precise temperature control of the device.

==Applications==
Water jackets are often used for water cooling or heating. They are also used in laboratory glassware: Liebig, Graham, and Allihn condensers. Water jackets were used to cool the barrels of machine guns until several years after the First World War, but modern machine guns are air-cooled to conserve weight and hence increase portability.

In a reciprocating piston internal combustion engine, the water jacket is a series of holes either cast or bored through the main engine block and connected by inlet and outlet valves to a radiator.

Equipment such as tissue culture incubators may be enclosed in a water jacket kept at a constant temperature.

A water jacket is used in an Orsat analyzer to prevent any change in temperature from affecting the density of the gas being analyzed.

The concept gives its name to the water jacket furnace, a type of blast furnace, using a cold air blast, that was used for the smelting of non-ferrous metallic mineral ores. These furnaces are cooled by a water jacket arrangement. The terminology is also used for an indirect heating device used in the petroleum oil and gas industry, generally known as a water jacket heater or water bath heater.

<doc id="682403" wikidata="Q1151232" url="?curid=682403" title="Names of large numbers">
<text>Depending on context (i.e. language, culture, region, ...) some large numbers have names that allow for describing large quantities in a textual form; not mathematical. For very large values, the text is generally shorter than a decimal numeric representation although longer than scientific notation.

Two naming scales for large numbers have been used in English and other European languages since the early modern era: the long and short scales. Most English variants use the short scale today, but the long scale remains dominant in many non-English-speaking areas, including continental Europe and Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America. These naming procedures are based on taking the number &quot;n&quot; occurring in 103&quot;n&quot;+3 (short scale) or 106&quot;n&quot; (long scale) and concatenating Latin roots for its units, tens, and hundreds place, together with the suffix &quot;-illion&quot;.

Names of numbers above a trillion are rarely used in practice; such large numbers have practical usage primarily in the scientific domain, where powers of ten are expressed as &quot;10&quot; with a numeric superscript. However, these somewhat rare names are considered acceptable for approximate statements. For example, the statement &quot;There are approximately 7.1 octillion atoms in an adult human body&quot; is understood to be in short scale of the table below (and is only accurate if referring to short scale rather than long scale).

The Indian numbering system uses the named numbers common between the long and short scales up to ten thousand. For larger values, it includes named numbers at each multiple of 100; including lakh (105) and crore (107). 

English also has words, such as &quot;zillion&quot;, that are used informally to mean large but unspecified amounts.

== Standard dictionary numbers ==

Usage:
* Short scale: US, English Canada, modern British, Australia, and Eastern Europe
* Long scale: French Canada, older British, Western &amp; Central Europe

Apart from &quot;million&quot;, the words in this list ending with -&quot;illion&quot; are all derived by adding prefixes (&quot;bi&quot;-, &quot;tri&quot;-, etc., derived from Latin) to the stem -&quot;illion&quot;. &quot;Centillion&quot; appears to be the highest name ending in -&quot;illion&quot; that is included in these dictionaries. &quot;Trigintillion&quot;, often cited as a word in discussions of names of large numbers, is not included in any of them, nor are any of the names that can easily be created by extending the naming pattern (&quot;unvigintillion&quot;, &quot;duovigintillion&quot;, &quot;duoquinquagintillion&quot;, etc.).

All of the dictionaries included &quot;googol&quot; and &quot;googolplex&quot;, generally crediting it to the Kasner and Newman book and to Kasner&#x27;s nephew (see below). None include any higher names in the googol family (googolduplex, etc.). The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; comments that &quot;googol&quot; and &quot;googolplex&quot; are &quot;not in formal mathematical use&quot;.

== Usage of names of large numbers ==

Some names of large numbers, such as &quot;million&quot;, &quot;billion&quot;, and &quot;trillion&quot;, have real referents in human experience, and are encountered in many contexts, particularly in finance and economics. At times, the names of large numbers have been forced into common usage as a result of hyperinflation. The highest numerical value banknote ever printed was a note for 1 sextillion pengő (1021 or 1 milliard bilpengő as printed) printed in Hungary in 1946. In 2009, Zimbabwe printed a 100 trillion (1014) Zimbabwean dollar note, which at the time of printing was worth about US$30. In global economics, the name of a significantly larger number was used in 2024, when the Russian news outlet RBK stated that the sum of legal claims against Google in Russia totalled 2 undecillion (2) rubles, or US $20 decillion (US $2); a value worth more than all financial assets in the world combined. A Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, stated that this value was symbolic.

Names of larger numbers, however, have a tenuous, artificial existence, rarely found outside definitions, lists, and discussions of how large numbers are named. Even well-established names like &quot;sextillion&quot; are rarely used, since in the context of science, including astronomy, where such large numbers often occur, they are nearly always written using scientific notation. In this notation, powers of ten are expressed as &quot;10&quot; with a numeric superscript, e.g. &quot;The X-ray emission of the radio galaxy is .&quot; When a number such as 1045 needs to be referred to in words, it is simply read out as &quot;ten to the forty-fifth&quot; or &quot;ten to the forty-five&quot;. This is easier to say and less ambiguous than &quot;quattuordecillion&quot;, which means something different in the long scale and the short scale.

When a number represents a quantity rather than a count, SI prefixes can be used—thus &quot;femtosecond&quot;, not &quot;one quadrillionth of a second&quot;—although often powers of ten are used instead of some of the very high and very low prefixes. In some cases, specialized units are used, such as the astronomer&#x27;s parsec and light year or the particle physicist&#x27;s barn.

Nevertheless, large numbers have an intellectual fascination and are of mathematical interest, and giving them names is one way people try to conceptualize and understand them.

One of the earliest examples of this is &quot;The Sand Reckoner&quot;, in which Archimedes gave a system for naming large numbers. To do this, he called the numbers up to a myriad myriad (108) &quot;first numbers&quot; and called 108 itself the &quot;unit of the second numbers&quot;. Multiples of this unit then became the second numbers, up to this unit taken a myriad myriad times, 108·108=1016. This became the &quot;unit of the third numbers&quot;, whose multiples were the third numbers, and so on. Archimedes continued naming numbers in this way up to a myriad myriad times the unit of the 108-th numbers, i.e. formula_1 and embedded this construction within another copy of itself to produce names for numbers up to formula_2 Archimedes then estimated the number of grains of sand that would be required to fill the known universe, and found that it was no more than &quot;one thousand myriad of the eighth numbers&quot; (1063).

Since then, many others have engaged in the pursuit of conceptualizing and naming numbers that have no existence outside the imagination. One motivation for such a pursuit is that attributed to the inventor of the word &quot;googol&quot;, who was certain that any finite number &quot;had to have a name&quot;. Another possible motivation is competition between students in computer programming courses, where a common exercise is that of writing a program to output numbers in the form of English words.

Most names proposed for large numbers belong to systematic schemes which are extensible. Thus, many names for large numbers are simply the result of following a naming system to its logical conclusion—or extending it further.

== Origins of the &quot;standard dictionary numbers&quot; ==

The words &quot;bymillion&quot; and &quot;trimillion&quot; were first recorded in 1475 in a manuscript of Jehan Adam. Subsequently, Nicolas Chuquet wrote a book &quot;Triparty en la science des nombres&quot; which was not published during Chuquet&#x27;s lifetime. However, most of it was copied by Estienne de La Roche for a portion of his 1520 book, &quot;L&#x27;arismetique&quot;. Chuquet&#x27;s book contains a passage in which he shows a large number marked off into groups of six digits, with the comment:
Ou qui veult le premier point peult signiffier million Le second point byllion Le tiers point tryllion Le quart quadrillion Le cinqe quyllion Le sixe sixlion Le sept.e septyllion Le huyte ottyllion Le neufe nonyllion et ainsi des ault&#x27;s se plus oultre on vouloit preceder

(Or if you prefer the first mark can signify million, the second mark byllion, the third mark tryllion, the fourth quadrillion, the fifth quyillion, the sixth sixlion, the seventh septyllion, the eighth ottyllion, the ninth nonyllion and so on with others as far as you wish to go).
Adam and Chuquet used the long scale of powers of a million; that is, Adam&#x27;s &quot;bymillion&quot; (Chuquet&#x27;s &quot;byllion&quot;) denoted 1012, and Adam&#x27;s &quot;trimillion&quot; (Chuquet&#x27;s &quot;tryllion&quot;) denoted 1018.

== The googol family ==

The names &quot;googol&quot; and &quot;googolplex&quot; were invented by Edward Kasner&#x27;s nephew Milton Sirotta and introduced in Kasner and Newman&#x27;s 1940 book &quot;Mathematics and the Imagination&quot; in the following passage:

John Horton Conway and Richard K. Guy have suggested that &quot;N-plex&quot; be used as a name for 10N. This gives rise to the name &quot;googolplexplex&quot; for 10googolplex = 10. Conway and Guy have proposed that &quot;N-minex&quot; be used as a name for 10−N, giving rise to the name &quot;googolminex&quot; for the reciprocal of a googolplex, which is written as 10. None of these names are in wide use.

The names &quot;googol&quot; and &quot;googolplex&quot; inspired the name of the Internet company Google and its corporate headquarters, the Googleplex, respectively.

== Extensions of the standard dictionary numbers ==
This section illustrates several systems for naming large numbers, and shows how they can be extended past &quot;vigintillion&quot;.

Traditional British usage assigned new names for each power of one million (the long scale): ; ; ; and so on. It was adapted from French usage, and is similar to the system that was documented or invented by Chuquet.

Traditional American usage (which was also adapted from French usage but at a later date), Canadian, and modern British usage assign new names for each power of one thousand (the short scale). Thus, a &quot;billion&quot; is 1000 × 10002 = 109; a &quot;trillion&quot; is 1000 × 10003 = 1012; and so forth. Due to its dominance in the financial world (and by the US dollar), this was adopted for official United Nations documents.

Traditional French usage has varied; in 1948, France, which had originally popularized the short scale worldwide, reverted to the long scale.
The term &quot;milliard&quot; is unambiguous and always means 109. It is seldom seen in American usage and rarely in British usage, but frequently in continental European usage. The term is sometimes attributed to French mathematician Jacques Peletier du Mans (for this reason, the long scale is also known as the &quot;Chuquet-Peletier&quot; system), but the Oxford English Dictionary states that the term derives from post-Classical Latin term &quot;milliartum&quot;, which became &quot;milliare&quot; and then &quot;milliart&quot; and finally our modern term.

Concerning names ending in -illiard for numbers 106&quot;n&quot;+3, &quot;milliard&quot; is certainly in widespread use in languages other than English, but the degree of actual use of the larger terms is questionable. The terms &quot;milliardo&quot; in Italian, &quot;Milliarde&quot; in German, &quot;miljard&quot; in Dutch, &quot;milyar&quot; in Turkish, and &quot;миллиард,&quot; milliard (transliterated) in Russian, are standard usage when discussing financial topics.

The naming procedure for large numbers is based on taking the number &quot;n&quot; occurring in 103&quot;n&quot;+3 (short scale) or 106&quot;n&quot; (long scale) and concatenating Latin roots for its units, tens, and hundreds place, together with the suffix &quot;-illion&quot;. In this way, numbers up to 103·999+3 = 103000 (short scale) or 106·999 = 105994 (long scale) may be named. The choice of roots and the concatenation procedure is that of the standard dictionary numbers if &quot;n&quot; is 9 or smaller. For larger &quot;n&quot; (between 10 and 999), prefixes can be constructed based on a system described by Conway and Guy. Today, sexdecillion and novemdecillion are standard dictionary numbers and, using the same reasoning as Conway and Guy did for the numbers up to nonillion, could probably be used to form acceptable prefixes. The Conway–Guy system for forming prefixes:

:(*) When preceding a component marked S or X, &quot;tre&quot; changes to &quot;tres&quot; and &quot;se&quot; to &quot;ses&quot; or &quot;sex&quot;; similarly, when preceding a component marked M or N, &quot;septe&quot; and &quot;nove&quot; change to &quot;septem&quot; and &quot;novem&quot; or &quot;septen&quot; and &quot;noven&quot;.

Since the system of using Latin prefixes will become ambiguous for numbers with exponents of a size which the Romans rarely counted to, like 106,000,258, Conway and Guy co-devised with Allan Wechsler the following set of consistent conventions that permit, in principle, the extension of this system indefinitely to provide English short-scale names for any integer whatsoever. The name of a number 103&quot;n&quot;+3, where &quot;n&quot; is greater than or equal to 1000, is formed by concatenating the names of the numbers of the form 103&quot;m&quot;+3, where &quot;m&quot; represents each group of comma-separated digits of &quot;n&quot;, with each but the last &quot;-illion&quot; trimmed to &quot;-illi-&quot;, or, in the case of &quot;m&quot; = 0, either &quot;-nilli-&quot; or &quot;-nillion&quot;. For example, 103,000,012, the 1,000,003rd &quot;-illion&quot; number, equals one &quot;millinillitrillion&quot;; 1033,002,010,111, the 11,000,670,036th &quot;-illion&quot; number, equals one &quot;undecillinilliseptuagintasescentillisestrigintillion&quot;; and 1029,629,629,633, the 9,876,543,210th &quot;-illion&quot; number, equals one &quot;nonilliseseptuagintaoctingentillitresquadragintaquingentillideciducentillion&quot;.

The following table shows number names generated by the system described by Conway and Guy for the short and long scales.

<text>Vincenzo Galilei (3 April 1520 – 2 July 1591) was an Italian lutenist, composer, and music theorist. His children included the astronomer and physicist Galileo Galilei and the lute virtuoso and composer Michelagnolo Galilei. Vincenzo was a figure in the musical life of the late Renaissance and contributed significantly to the musical revolution that demarcates the beginning of the Baroque era.

In his study of pitch and string tension, Galilei produced perhaps the first non-linear mathematical description of a natural phenomenon known to history. Some credit him with directing the activity of his son away from pure, abstract mathematics and towards experimentation using mathematical quantitative description of the results, a direction of importance for the history of physics and natural science.

==Biography==
He was born in 1520 in Santa Maria a Monte, near Pisa, Tuscany and began studying the lute at an early age. His mother was from San Vincenzo near Livorno. Sometime before 1562 he moved to Pisa, where on 5 July he married Giulia Ammannati of a noble family. Galileo Galilei was the oldest of six or seven children; another son, Michelagnolo, born in 1575, became an accomplished lutenist and composer.

Galilei was a skilled player of the lute who early in life attracted the attention of powerful patrons. In 1563, he met Gioseffo Zarlino, the most important music theorist of the sixteenth century, in Venice, and began studying with him. Somewhat later he became interested in the attempts to revive ancient Greek music and drama, by way of his association with the Florentine Camerata, a group of poets, musicians and intellectuals led by Count Giovanni de&#x27; Bardi, as well as his contacts with Girolamo Mei, the foremost scholar of the time of ancient Greek music. 
Galilei composed two books of madrigals, as well as music for lute, and a considerable quantity of music for voice and lute; this latter category is considered to be his most important contribution as it anticipated in many ways the style of the early Baroque.

The use of recitative in opera is widely attributed to Galilei, since he was one of the inventors of monody, the musical style closest to recitative.

==Acoustics and music theory==

Galilei promoted equal temperament. In his exploration of tuning and keys, he composed 24 groups of dances, &quot;clearly related to 12 major and 12 minor keys&quot; (1584).

Some of Galilei&#x27;s most important theoretical contributions involve the treatment of dissonance: he had a largely modern conception, allowing passing dissonance &quot;if the voices flow smoothly&quot; as well as on-the-beat dissonance, such as suspensions, which he called &quot;essential dissonance&quot;. This describes Baroque practice, especially as he defines rules for resolution of suspensions by a preliminary leap away from, followed by a return to, the expected note of resolution.

Vincenzo Galilei was one of the pioneers in the systematic study of acoustics, mainly in his research (assisted by his son Galileo) in the mathematical formula of stretched strings. Galileo told his biographer that Vincenzo introduced him to the idea of systematic testing and measurement through their Pisa house basement, which was strung with lengths of lute string materials, each of different lengths, with different weights attached.

Galilei made discoveries in acoustics, particularly involving the physics of vibrating strings and columns of air. He discovered that while the ratio of an interval is proportional to string lengths — for example, a perfect fifth has the proportions of 3:2 — it varied with the &quot;square root&quot; of the tension applied (and the cube root of concave volumes of air). Weights suspended from strings of equal length need to be in a ratio of 9:4 to produce the 3:2 perfect fifth.

This work was taken further by Marin Mersenne, who formulated the current law of vibrating strings. Mersenne was only three years old when Vincenzo died, but he would later maintain a regular link to Galileo (and many other scientists). He treated Galileo as a prized member of his scientific network. He communicated Galileo&#x27;s ideas for a pendulum clock to Christiaan Huygens (who improved on it).

Despite being a priest, Mersenne defended Galileo when he came under attack by the church in 1633, but he also questioned Galileo&#x27;s claims and disputed the accuracy of some of Galileo&#x27;s findings. He conducted his own duplicate experiments, which improved on their accuracy.

<text>Galápagos (1985) is the eleventh novel published by American author Kurt Vonnegut. Set in the Galápagos Islands after a global financial disaster, the novel questions the merit of the human brain from an evolutionary perspective. The title is both a reference to the islands on which part of the story plays out, and a tribute to Charles Darwin, on whose theory Vonnegut relies to reach his own conclusions. It was published by Delacorte Press.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Galápagos&quot; is the story of a small band of mismatched humans who are shipwrecked on the fictional island of Santa Rosalia in the Galápagos Islands after a global financial crisis cripples the world&#x27;s economy. Shortly thereafter, a disease renders all humans on Earth infertile, with the exception of the people on Santa Rosalia, making them the last specimens of humankind. Over the next million years, their descendants, the only fertile humans left on the planet, eventually evolve into a furry species resembling sea lions: though possibly still able to walk upright (it is not explicitly mentioned, but it is stated that they occasionally catch land animals), they have a snout with teeth adapted for catching fish, a streamlined skull and flipper-like hands with rudimentary fingers (described as &quot;nubbins&quot;).

The story&#x27;s narrator is a spirit who has been watching over humans for the last million years. This particular ghost is the immortal spirit of Leon Trotsky Trout, son of Vonnegut&#x27;s recurring character Kilgore Trout. Leon is a Vietnam War veteran who is affected by the massacres in Vietnam. He goes AWOL and settles in Sweden, where he works as a shipbuilder and dies during the construction of the ship, the &quot;Bahía de Darwin&quot;. This ship is used for the &quot;Nature Cruise of the Century&quot;. Planned as a celebrity cruise, it was in limbo due to the economic downturn, and due to a chain of unconnected events the ship ended up allowing humans to reach and survive in the Galápagos. A group of girls from a cannibal tribe living in the Amazon rainforest, called the Kanka-bono girls also end up on the ship, eventually having children with sperm obtained from the ship&#x27;s captain.

The deceased Kilgore Trout makes four appearances in the novel, urging his son to enter the &quot;blue tunnel&quot; that leads to the afterlife. When Leon refuses for the fourth time, Kilgore pledges that he, and the blue tunnel, will not return for one million years, which leaves Leon to observe the slow process of evolution that transforms the humans into aquatic mammals. The process begins when a Japanese woman on the island, the granddaughter of a Hiroshima survivor, gives birth to a fur-covered daughter.

Trout maintains that all the sorrows of humankind were caused by &quot;the only true villain in my story: the oversized human brain&quot;. Natural selection eliminates this problem, since the humans best fitted to Santa Rosalia were those who could swim best, which required a streamlined head, which in turn required a smaller brain.

== Literary techniques ==

=== Form ===
The main story is told a-chronologically with a framing story told by a narrator from a point a million years in the future, interspersed with flashbacks and commentary about the outcomes of future events of the main storyline. As a gimmick, an asterisk is placed in front of a character&#x27;s name if they will die before sunset.

=== Quotations ===
The novel contains a large number of quotations from other authors. They are related to the story itself and are functionally inserted through Mandarax, a fictional voice translator that is also able to provide quotations from literature and history. The following authors are quoted (in order of their appearance in the book): Anne Frank, Alfred Tennyson, Rudyard Kipling, John Masefield, William Cullen Bryant, Ambrose Bierce, Lord Byron, Noble Claggett, John Greenleaf Whittier, Benjamin Franklin, John Heywood, Cesare Bonesana Beccaria, Bertolt Brecht, Saint John, Charles Dickens, Isaac Watts, William Shakespeare, Plato, Robert Browning, Jean de La Fontaine, François Rabelais, Patrick R. Chalmers, Michel de Montaigne, Joseph Conrad, George William Curtis, Samuel Butler, T. S. Eliot, A. E. Housman, Oscar Hammerstein II, Edgar Allan Poe, Charles E. Carryl, Samuel Johnson, Thomas Carlyle, Edward Lear, Henry David Thoreau, Sophocles, Robert Frost, and Charles Darwin.

== Adaptations ==
In 2009, Audible.com produced an audio version of &quot;Galapagos&quot;, narrated by Jonathan Davis, as part of its &quot;Modern Vanguard&quot; line of audiobooks.

In 2014, artists Tucker Marder and Christian Scheider adapted &quot;Galapagos&quot; into a live theatrical performance at the new Parrish Art Museum in Watermill, N.Y. Endorsed by the Kurt Vonnegut Estate, the multi-media production featured 26 performers including Bob Balaban; live orchestral underscoring composed and conducted by Forrest Gray featuring Max Feldschuh on vibraphone and Ken Sacks on mbira; animal costumes by Isla Hansen; a three-story scenic design by Shelby Jackson; experimental video projections by James Bayard; and choreography by Matt Davies.

In 2019, Canadian band The PepTides released a ten-song collection titled &quot;Galápagos Vol.1&quot;, inspired by the themes and characters in Galápagos.

<text>Highway 39 is a minor 29 km (19 mi) long spur route in the Regional District of Fraser-Fort George. It runs from a point on the John Hart Highway just north of Tudyah Lake northwest to the town of Mackenzie, near the southern arm of Williston Lake. Highway 39 and the town of Mackenzie were both built in the 1960s as a measure of support for workers on the construction project of the W. A. C. Bennett Dam (which is not on the same arm of Williston Lake as Mackenzie). The road did not gain its &#x27;39&#x27; designation until 1975.

<text>Girolamo Mei (27 May 1519 – July 1594) was an Italian historian and humanist, famous in music history for providing the intellectual impetus to the Florentine Camerata, which attempted to revive ancient Greek music drama. He was born in Florence, and died in Rome and also used the pseudonym Decimo Corinella da Peretola.

Mei was the first European after Boethius to do a detailed study of ancient Greek music theory. He compiled his findings in a major treatise, &quot;De modis musicis antiquorum&quot; (not formally published, but written 1568 to 1573). Many of his findings he communicated to Vincenzo Galilei through an extensive correspondence; this information was decisive in the formation of the new musical style which was developing in Florence at the end of the 16th century, the new recitative style (&quot;stile recitativo&quot;) from which developed monody, the first music dramas, and eventually opera. Galilei and the others in the Florentine Camerata were determined to revive the musical style of ancient Greek drama, and while they may have been mistaken, ultimately, in how it was actually performed, they began, using ideas from Mei, one of the greatest revolutions in music history.

Mei also edited and annotated the tragedies of Aeschylus and Euripides, as well as many other works by classical writers.

<text>Hugh McCulloch (December 7, 1808 – May 24, 1895) was an American financier who played a central role in financing the American Civil War. He served two non-consecutive terms as U.S. Treasury Secretary under three presidents. He was originally opposed to the creation of a system of national banks, but his reputation as head of the Bank of Indiana from 1857 to 1863 persuaded the Treasury to bring him in to supervise the new system as Comptroller of the Currency 1863–1865. As Secretary of the Treasury 1865–1869 he reduced and funded the gigantic Civil War debt of the union, and reestablished the federal taxation system across the former Confederate States of America. He tried but failed to make a rapid return to the gold standard.

He was the last surviving member of the Lincoln Cabinet.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born in Kennebunk, Maine, he was the son of Hugh McCulloch Sr., one of the largest shipbuilders in New England, and Abial Perkins. He was educated at Thornton Academy in Saco, Maine, and attended Bowdoin College for two years, leaving due to ill health. He taught school, then studied law in Boston, and in 1833 began practicing law at Fort Wayne, Indiana. He was cashier and manager of the Fort Wayne branch of the state chartered Bank of Indiana and president of the larger organization from 1835 to 1857, and president of its successor, the privately owned Bank of Indiana, from 1857 to 1863. Despite his early opposition to the National Banking Act of 1862, he was selected by Salmon P. Chase to be the first Comptroller of the Currency in 1863. During McCulloch&#x27;s 22 months in office, 868 national banks were chartered and no failures occurred. As the first Comptroller, McCulloch recommended major changes in the banking law and the resulting National Banking Act of 1864 remains the foundation of the national banking system.

===Bank of Indiana===
McCulloch began his banking career as the President of the Bank of Indiana. In 1833 the bank was established in response to the closure of the Second Bank of the United States. Indiana was still a wilderness and no eastern bank was willing to take charge of the fledgling state bank. McCulloch was one of the few prominent businessmen in the young state, and although he had no banking experience, he was appointed because he was the most qualified person willing to take the position.

He ran the bank with great efficiency making it one of the most stable in the nation. He remained president until the bank was closed in 1859 and the bank&#x27;s notes were exchanged for federal notes from the new national bank. He then went on to become president of the Second Bank of Indiana, where he remained until 1865.

===Government career===
A day or two after Lincoln&#x27;s second inauguration, Abraham Lincoln convoked him in his office at the White House to have a talk with him, and was offered the position of Treasury Secretary, which he didn&#x27;t expect and didn&#x27;t want at first. On March 9, 1865, he was appointed as the 27th Secretary of the Treasury by President Abraham Lincoln. His appointment was largely due to his influence with existing state banks. McCulloch later remarked that on the morning of Lincoln&#x27;s assassination, &quot;I never saw Mr. Lincoln so cheerful and happy...The burden which had been weighing upon him for four long years, and which he had borne with heroic fortitude, had been lifted; the war had been practically ended; the Union was safe.&quot;

McCulloch was also with him on his death bed until his last moments. As he was about to leave the White House, Abraham Lincoln took him by the hand and said : &quot;We must look to you, Mr. Secretary, for the money to pay off the soldiers&quot;, to which he replied: &quot;I shall look to the people... they have not failed us thus far, and I don&#x27;t think they will now&quot;. A few hours later, he saw the president becoming unconscious and saw him dying. The death bed scene was immortalized in number of paintings afterwards. He continued where it had been left by Mr. Lincoln, and served in the Presidential Cabinet of Andrew Johnson until the close of his administration in 1869.

Immediately confronted with inflation caused by the government&#x27;s wartime issue of greenbacks, he recommended their retirement and a return to the gold standard. In McCulloch&#x27;s first annual report, issued on December 4, 1865, he strongly urged the retirement of the legal tenders or greenbacks as a preliminary to the resumption of specie payments. However this would have reduced the supply of currency and was unpopular during the period of postwar reconstruction and westward expansion.
In accordance with this suggestion an act was passed, on March 12, 1866, authorizing the retirement of not more than $10,000,000 in six months and not more than $4,000,000 per month thereafter. This act met with strong opposition and was repealed on the February 4, 1868, after only $48,000,000 had been retired. The battle over its revival raged for the next fifty years. McCulloch was also disappointed by the decision of the United States Supreme Court upholding the constitutionality of the legal tenders.

During his tenure, McCulloch maintained a policy of reducing the federal war debt and the careful reintroduction of federal taxation in the South.

Soon after the close of his term of office McCulloch went to England, and spent six years (1870–1876) as a partner and member of the banking firm of Jay Cooke, McCulloch &amp; Co. Their firm received from the Secretary of the Navy, George M. Robeson, the contract for the deposits made in London for the payment of naval officers abroad, with most partners being close friends of General Grant. His partner, Jay Cooke, was the chief financier of Lincoln&#x27;s Union Army, and was the proprietor of America&#x27;s premier banking house before his fall.

From October 1884 until the close of President Chester A. Arthur&#x27;s term of office in March 1885, McCulloch again served as Secretary of the Treasury. During his six months in office at that time, he continued his fight for currency backed by gold, warning that the coinage of silver, used by then as backing for currency, should be halted.
After his death, McCulloch&#x27;s portrait was used on several issues of $20 U.S. national bank notes (specifically the 1902 series). 
===Reconstruction finance===

The Civil War had been financed primarily by issuing short-term and long-term bonds and loans, plus inflation caused by printing paper money, plus new taxes. Wholesale prices had more than doubled, and reduction of inflation was a priority for Secretary McCulloch. A high priority, and by far the most controversial, was the currency question. The old paper currency issued by state banks had been withdrawn, and Confederate currency was worthless. The national banks had issued $207 million in currency, which was backed by gold and silver. The federal treasury had issued $428 million in greenbacks, which was legal tender but not backed by gold or silver. In addition about $275 million of coin was in circulation.

The new administration policy announced in October would be to make all the paper convertible into specie, if Congress so voted. The House of Representatives passed the Alley Resolution on December 18, 1865, by vote of 144 to 6. In the Senate it was a different matter, for the key player was Senator John Sherman, who said that inflation contraction was not nearly as important as refunding the short-term and long-term national debt. the war had been largely financed by national debt, in addition to taxation and inflation. The national debt stood at $2.8 billion. By October 1865, most of it in short term and temporary loans. Wall Street bankers typified by Jay Cooke believe that the economy was about to grow rapidly, thanks to the development of agriculture through the Homestead Act, the expansion of railroads, especially rebuilding the devastated Southern railroads and n opening the transcontinental line to the West Coast, and especially the flourishing of manufacturing during the war.

The goal premium over greenbacks was hundred and $145 in greenbacks to $100 in gold, and the optimists thought that they heavy demand for currency in an era of prosperity would return the ratio to 100. A compromise was reached in April 1866, that limited the treasury to a currency contraction of only $10 million over six months. Meanwhile, the Senate refunded the entire national debt, but the House failed to act. By early 1867, postwar prosperity was a reality, and the optimists wanted an end to contraction, which Congress ordered in January 1868. Meanwhile, the Treasury issued new bonds at a lower interest rate to refinance the redemption of short-term debt. while the old state bank notes were disappearing from circulation, new national bank notes, backed by species, were expanding. By 1868 inflation was minimal.

==Personal==
McCulloch&#x27;s first marriage, to Eunice Hardy, ended when she died young. His second marriage was to Susan Man, a schoolteacher, whom he met in Fort Wayne in 1836 when he was a young widower. Susan was the aunt of Albon P. Man, cofounder with William E. Sawyer of the Electro-Dynamic Light Company, competitors of Thomas Edison. Hugh McCulloch was an early investor in the company with James Powell Kernochan. The couple had six children. One of his daughters, Marie Louise, married to John B. Yale, son of Linus Yale Jr., and brother of Julian L. Yale, members of the Yale family.

He died at his home, Holly Hill in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, near Washington, D.C., in 1895 and is buried in Rock Creek Cemetery in D.C. His wife, Susan McCulloch, died at the residence of her son-in-law, John B. Yale, in 1898. Her great uncle was Naphtali Daggett, President of Yale College, and her family members included Gen. Moores, Gen. Melanchton Woolsey, Congressman and Senator Jonas Platt, and Alida Livingston, member of the Schuyler and Livingston family.

McCulloch was also a millionaire of 1892, and was featured in the book of American Millionaires of that year.

==Legacy==
According to economic historian Allan Peskin, McCulloch&#x27;s career exemplifies the Western pioneer as banker, and also the banker as a Christian moralist. He was well-educated but had no business or banking experience. His honesty proved an essential asset in the age of rascality and dubious paper money. His greatest challenges came in building the brand-new national banking system during the war, and afterwards refinancing the enormous Union debt. The Confederate debt was repudiated and never repaid.

The biggest puzzle was dealing with $428 million in greenbacks, in an age where McCulloch like all orthodox economists, rejected paper money. His remedy was a rapid return to specie payment using gold and silver and retiring the greenbacks. This contraction policy removed money from circulation, lowered prices, wages and profits, and put heavy pressures on debtors. The Republican Party, however, backed McCulloch&#x27;s program, and his years at Treasury were highly prosperous. He left the government in 1869 to become a very rich international financier.

McCulloch Hall, a residence hall at Harvard Business School, was named in his honor.

The U.S. Revenue Cutter Service and its successor, the U.S. Coast Guard, each named cutters after McCulloch. The Revenue Cutter USS &quot;McCulloch&quot; served under George Dewey in the Battle of Manila during the Spanish–American War, and Coast Guard Cutter &quot;McCulloch&quot; served in World War II and the Vietnam War.

The chief authority for the life of McCulloch is his own book, &quot;Men and Measures of Half a Century&quot; (New York, 1888). McCulloch was the last surviving member of the Lincoln Cabinet.

His house at Fort Wayne, the Hugh McCulloch House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

<text>The Cross of Sitio Torril is probably the oldest religious relic in the town of Meycauayan, Bulacan in the Philippines. It is crafted in the late Baroque style and is dated by Philippine church history expert Regalado Trota Jose at around the late 17th century. Although it may be the oldest church relic found in Meycauayan, it is doubtful that it came from the parish founders Diego de Oropesa and Juan Plasencia.

The cross was erected by Franciscans. It was re-discovered by three members of the St. Francis parish&#x27;s Committee on Church Cultural Heritage in the year 2001. The cross was in the custody of the late Fidel Amparo of Barangay Bahay Pari, whose house is near the site of what is believed to be the original site of the first parish church and/or the first town center. Upon his death, the cross has been turned over to the barrio chapel. The cross is loaned every year to the parish church of St. Francis of Assisi on its feast day of October 4.

The cross is on Bahay Pari Chapel (Sitio Toril) and loaned every 3rd week of September to Meycauayan Church sign that the feast is near called (LAKBAYAN).

<text>The Canisteo River is a tributary of the Tioga River in western New York in the United States. It drains a dissected plateau, a portion of the northern Allegheny Plateau southwest of the Finger Lakes region, in the far northwestern reaches of the watershed of the Susquehanna River.

It rises in the hills of northern Allegany County, New York approximately southwest of Dansville, New York. It flows east into northern Steuben County, New York, then generally southeast past Hornell, New York and Canisteo, New York. It joins the Tioga from the west in southeastern Steuben County, approximately north of the Pennsylvania state line and southwest of Corning, New York.

The origin of the name of the river is obscure, likely from the Algonquian languages subfamily of American indigenous languages meaning either &quot;pickerel&quot; or &quot;head of water&quot;.

==History==
The Canisteo River empties via the Tioga into the Chemung River, and it into the Susquehanna River. This allowed goods transported on the Canisteo River to reach the Atlantic via the ports of Havre de Grace and Perryville, Maryland, midway between Baltimore and Philadelphia. Prior to the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825, this was western New York State&#x27;s most direct route for products going to market. As on other rivers in the Susquehanna basin, transportation on the Canisteo before the middle of the 19th century was often accomplished by arks up to long. Arkport, New York, on the Canisteo River, was the highest navigable point in the Susquehanna watershed.

Since the upper headwaters went through virgin forest, an early timber industry developed. Logs were floated down the river after being cut. Livestock and crops soon followed. 
In the floods of 1936, the river overflowed and inundated parts of the Canisteo and Hornell, leading to the construction of flood control systems in both communities. The only flooding since then was from Hurricane Agnes of 1972, in which the river destroyed the Erie Railroad line south of Hornell and New York Route 36 between Canisteo and Hornell, which was rebuilt further from the river.

<text>As borrowed from Yiddish, a &#x27; or &#x27; is &quot;a person of integrity and honor&quot;. American humorist Leo Rosten describes a as &quot;someone to admire and emulate, someone of noble character. The key to being &#x27;a real mensch&#x27; is nothing less than character, rectitude, dignity, a sense of what is right, responsible, decorous&quot;. The term is used as a high compliment, implying the rarity and value of that individual&#x27;s qualities.

==Overview==
In Yiddish, &quot;mentsh&quot; roughly means &quot;a good person&quot;. The word has migrated as a loanword into American English, in the original German spelling, with a &quot;mensch&quot; being a particularly good person, similar to a &quot;stand-up guy&quot;, a person with the qualities one would hope for in a friend or trusted colleague. &quot;Mentshlekhkeyt&quot; (; ) refers to the properties which make a person a &quot;mensch&quot;.

During the Age of Enlightenment, in Germany the term , in the philosophical sense of compassion, was used in Humanism to describe what characterizes a better human being. The concept goes back to Cicero&#x27;s &quot;humanitas&quot;, which was literally translated as in German, from which the Yiddish word &quot;mentsh&quot; derives.

The word and the underlying concept have had an impact on popular culture. &quot;The Mensch on a Bench&quot; is a 2012 Hanukkah-themed book and doll set parodying &quot;The Elf on the Shelf&quot;. A life-size version of the doll was adopted as the mascot of Team Israel at the World Baseball Classic in 2016. According to pitcher Gabe Cramer, &quot;The Mensch is a great way to have fun in the dugout while reminding us of why we&#x27;re here and who we&#x27;re representing&quot;.

<doc id="682456" wikidata="Q815943" url="?curid=682456" title="Belleville Bulls">
<text>The Belleville Bulls were a junior ice hockey team, founded in 1981 and based in Belleville, Ontario. The team played in the Eastern Division of the Eastern Conference of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). The team relocated to Hamilton, Ontario, at the end of the 2014–15 OHL season.

==History==
The Belleville Bulls started in 1979 as a Junior Tier II team in the OHA. In their second season in 1980–81, the Bulls won the Tier II title, defeating the Guelph Platers in the league finals. The Bulls then competed in the national championship for the Manitoba Centennial Trophy hosted in Halifax, Nova Scotia losing in the finals to the Prince Albert Raiders.

On February 2, 1981, the OHL granted an expansion franchise to the city of Belleville and the ownership group of Dr. Robert L. Vaughan &amp; Bob Dolan. Dr. Robert L. Vaughan remained an owner/co-owner of the team for over 20 years until he sold the team in 2004 to Gord Simmonds. Dr. Vaughan was awarded the Bill Long award in 1993 for distinguished service to the OHL.

In 1983, Belleville hosted the OHL All-Star Game, known then as the OHL Chrysler Cup.

The Bulls reached the OHL finals in 1986 versus a familiar foe from their Tier II days, the Guelph Platers. The Platers won the series in 6 games. In 1995 and 1996, the Bulls lost in the semi-finals to the Guelph Storm.

The 1999 season would be one for the memories when the Belleville Bulls would win it all. The Bulls defeated the London Knights 9–2 in game seven of the OHL championship series at the Yardmen Arena to win their first J. Ross Robertson Cup.

The Bulls competed in the 1999 Memorial Cup, hosted in Ottawa versus the Calgary Hitmen, Acadie–Bathurst Titan and Ottawa 67&#x27;s. Belleville finished third, losing to Ottawa 4–2 in the semifinal.

In the 2005–06 season, the Belleville Bulls celebrated their 25th anniversary in the OHL. The team also hosted the annual OHL All-Star game for the second time, on February 1, 2006. The Bulls set a season-best record of 102 points earned during the 2007–08 regular season.

In 2007–08, the Bulls made a trip to the Memorial Cup by virtue of Kitchener winning the Western Conference, and being the host, Belleville would get in as the OHL representative. The Bulls would lose the semi-final game 9–0 against the hosting team, the Kitchener Rangers, who would eventually lose to the Spokane Chiefs in the championship game.

On March 12, 2015, Michael Andlauer announced that he had acquired the Belleville Bulls and that they would move to Hamilton&#x27;s FirstOntario Centre for the 2015–16 season to become the Hamilton Bulldogs. The Hamilton Bulldogs, an American Hockey League franchise, was concurrently sold to the Montreal Canadiens and moved to St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, for the 2015–16 season as the St. John&#x27;s IceCaps (the True North Sports and Entertainment-owned IceCaps, which was affiliated with the Winnipeg Jets, moved back to Winnipeg to become the Manitoba Moose).

==Coaches==
Larry Mavety coached the Belleville Bulls for 14 seasons. He is third only to Brian Kilrea and Dale Hunter for amount of time coached with an OHL team.

Lou Crawford was groomed by Mavety to replace him behind the Bulls&#x27; bench. Lou Crawford is the brother of former NHL head coach Marc Crawford, who was also the head coach of the St. John&#x27;s Maple Leafs (now the Toronto Marlies) in the American Hockey League, which played in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador. Their father, Floyd Crawford, was team captain of the 1959 World Champion Belleville McFarlands.

Former head coaches Lou Crawford and Shawn MacKenzie both had brief NHL careers. George Burnett briefly coached with the Edmonton Oilers. James Boyd is the only former Bulls player to later coach the Belleville team.

==Geography==
The district includes the counties of Cumberland, and Colchester. Communities include the towns of Amherst, Oxford, Parrsboro, Springhill, Stewiacke and Truro, as well as the villages of Bible Hill, Pugwash and Tatamagouche.

==History==

This riding was created as &quot;Cumberland—Colchester North&quot; in 1966 from Cumberland and Colchester—Hants ridings. It consisted of the county of Cumberland and the northern part of the county of Colchester, including the town of Truro. It was abolished in 1976 when it was merged with the remainder of Colchester County into &quot;Cumberland—Colchester&quot; riding.

Cumberland–Colchester was abolished in 2003. The territory was combined with the largely rural Musquodoboit Valley portion of the Halifax Regional Municipality in a new riding called &quot;North Nova&quot;. After the election in 2004, the name was changed to &quot;Cumberland—Colchester—Musquodoboit Valley&quot;.

2009 By-election

In early 2009, Incumbent Bill Casey announced he would not be re-offering in the next Federal Election. He subsequently announced his resignation from Parliament to become the Senior Inter-Governmental Affairs Representative for Nova Scotia in Ottawa.

In April 2009 Scott Armstrong was confirmed as the next Conservative Party candidate in the riding. At the time, he was the president of the provincial Progressive Conservative Party.

In September 2009, Jim Burrows was selected as the next Liberal Party candidate in the riding having defeated 2008 candidate, Tracy Parsons. He received 175 of 206 votes cast. He is a dairy farmer from Green Oaks and Chair of the Board of Directors for Scotsburn Co-operative Services.

Mark Austin was selected to run for the New Democratic Party.

Christian Heritage Party ran Jim Hnatiuk, a retired military officer and the owner of Nova Scotia&#x27;s largest hunting and fishing store, in Lantz. Hnatiuk was chosen party leader in November 2008.

Green Party leader Elizabeth May had said she was interested in running in the by-election, but subsequently announced she would run in the riding of Saanich-Gulf Islands. The party instead ran Jason Blanch.

As per the 2012 federal electoral redistribution, this riding was largely dissolved into the new riding &#x27;Cumberland—Colchester&#x27;, with small portions going to Central Nova and Sackville—Preston—Chezzetcook.

Incumbent MP Bill Casey, re-elected in 2006 as a member of the Conservative Party, was expelled from the Conservative caucus in 2007 after voting against the 2007 budget, which he objected to on the grounds of alleged violations of the Atlantic Accord. He attempted to run for the Conservative nomination for the next federal election but was refused. Casey therefore ran for re-election as an independent. The Green Party endorsed Casey and did not nominate a candidate opposing his reelection.

<text>Highway 29, known locally as &quot;Don Philips Way&quot;, is a shortcut route from the John Hart Highway to the Alaska Highway in the Peace River Regional District. It is also the main access to the coal mining community of Tumbler Ridge, as well as the W. A. C. Bennett Dam facility near Hudson&#x27;s Hope. The highway gained its &#x27;29&#x27; designation from Chetwynd north to Hudson&#x27;s Hope in 1967, and then seventeen years later, the road from Chetwynd south to Tumbler Ridge was given the same number.

==Route details==
In Tumbler Ridge, the long Highway 29 starts at a junction with Highway 52, and travels north northwest for to its junction with the John Hart Highway at Chetwynd. It follows the John Hart Highway through Chetwynd for east, then turns northwest for past Moberly Lake to Hudson&#x27;s Hope, where a connector road to the W. A. C. Bennett Dam begins. northeast of Hudson&#x27;s Hope, Highway 29 finally meets the Alaska Highway north of Fort St. John near Charlie Lake.

<text>Emilio Marcos de Palma Morella (born 7 January 1978) is an Argentine man who was the first documented person born on the continent of Antarctica.

==Biography==
Palma was born in Fortín Sargento Cabral at the Esperanza Base, near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, and weighed . His father, Captain Jorge Emilio Palma, was head of the Argentine Army detachment at the base. While ten people have been born in Antarctica since, Palma&#x27;s birthplace remains the southernmost.

In late 1977, Silvia Morella de Palma, who was then seven months pregnant, was airlifted to Esperanza Base, in order to complete her pregnancy in the base. The airlift was a part of the Argentine solutions to the sovereignty dispute over territory in Antarctica. Emilio was automatically granted Argentine citizenship by the government since his parents were both Argentine citizens, and he was born in the claimed Argentine Antarctica. This is a sector of Antarctica claimed by Argentina as part of its national territory, although this claim is not internationally recognised and overlaps with British and Chilean claims.

He is featured in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; as the first person known to have been born on the continent.

<doc id="682473" wikidata="Q3294013" url="?curid=682473" title="Mark Brunell">
<text>Mark Allen Brunell (born September 17, 1970) is an American professional football coach and former quarterback who is the quarterbacks coach for the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL). He previously played in the NFL for 19 seasons, most notably with the Jacksonville Jaguars. For his accomplishments in Jacksonville, he was inducted to the Pride of the Jaguars in 2013.

Brunell played college football for the Washington Huskies and was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the fifth round of the 1993 NFL draft. After two seasons, Brunell was traded to the expansion Jaguars for their inaugural 1995 season. Within their second season, he helped the team obtain the franchise&#x27;s first winning record, playoff berth, postseason victories, and AFC Championship Game appearance. Brunell went on to guide Jacksonville to four consecutive playoff runs within their first five seasons, the first NFL expansion team to do so, and clinched the franchise&#x27;s first division title in 1999 en route to a second AFC Championship appearance. He also received three Pro Bowl selections with the Jaguars.

Following his 2004 departure from Jacksonville, Brunell played for the Washington Redskins, New Orleans Saints, and New York Jets until retiring in 2011. With the Saints, he was part of the team that won the franchise&#x27;s first Super Bowl title in Super Bowl XLIV, where he served as a backup and holder. Since retiring, he has pursued a coaching career and became the Lions&#x27; quarterbacks coach in 2021.

==Early life==
Brunell was the starting quarterback for the St. Joseph High School Knights of Santa Maria, California, in the 1985, 1986, and 1987 seasons. Brunell led his team to two league championships and one appearance in the CIF Central Section finals.

As a senior with SJHS, he completed 172 of 323 passes for 2,376 yards and 13 touchdowns, averaged 36.3 yards per punt, and added nine rushing touchdowns.

==College career==
Brunell signed with the University of Washington out of high school in 1988, joining a highly touted recruiting class that included future fellow NFL players Lincoln Kennedy and Steve Emtman.

Brunell saw his first action in his redshirt freshman year, and took over the starting duties in his sophomore season in 1990. Brunell&#x27;s abilities as a run-pass combo quarterback flashed potential from his first start. In his third start, Brunell led the Huskies in a 31–0 romp over a highly ranked USC team, which established the Huskies of the early 1990s as a potential force in Pac-10 football. While Brunell continued to develop throughout his first season as a starter, the Huskies climbed in the rankings. An early-season loss to the eventual national champion Colorado and a late-season 25–22 loss to UCLA were the only setbacks for what, by season&#x27;s end, was a dominant Husky team. With the Huskies crowned Pac-10 champions, Brunell played his best game yet in the Rose Bowl and was named the game&#x27;s MVP as Washington coasted to a 46–34 win over Big Ten Conference champion Iowa. After building a 39–14 lead after three quarters, Washington heavily substituted with reserves; the Hawkeyes scored twenty points in the fourth quarter.

Though the Huskies finished the season ranked 5th in the Associated Press poll, one poll crowned them national champions. Irrespective of their final ranking, the Huskies, with Brunell&#x27;s star rising, seemed set to soar to even loftier heights in 1991. Brunell was expected to lead the Huskies in 1991, but a devastating knee injury in the annual Husky spring game would sideline Brunell and cast the Husky hopes for a national championship run in doubt. Brunell, however, was capably replaced by Puyallup native Billy Joe Hobert, and the University of Washington went on to win their first two games in Brunell&#x27;s absence. Though Brunell was not yet fully recovered, he returned months ahead of schedule to action in Washington&#x27;s third game in 1991. Brunell received a standing ovation upon his return in the 56–3 victory over Kansas State.

Brunell would be given an opportunity to lead series on a part-time basis in the remainder of Husky games as the season progressed, typically at least one drive in each 2nd quarter in addition to the second half. The 1991 Washington team defeated every regular-season opponent with most games providing plenty of playing time for younger and backup players.

On January 1, 1992, Brunell played a small role (throwing a touchdown pass to Mario Bailey) in Washington&#x27;s second straight Rose Bowl victory, this time over Michigan. Washington finished the season ranked first in the coaches poll, winning the National Championship, and 2nd in the Associated Press poll, behind undefeated Miami.

In 1992, with two successful quarterbacks returning (Hobert and Brunell), Brunell was unable to wrestle the starting QB spot away from Hobert and as such contributed in a limited role during their first eight games (all wins). However, during the week of November 2, 1992, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; ran an exposé on Washington football wherein current starter Hobert was implicated in actions seemingly in violation of NCAA rules. As a result, Hobert was immediately suspended and Brunell was thrust back into the starting role for the Huskies. Now a senior, Brunell steered the devastated Huskies to one win in their last three regular-season games. The Huskies, however, again won the Pac-10 and Brunell started his second Rose Bowl game, this time against Michigan.

In 2015, Brunell was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
===Green Bay Packers===
The Green Bay Packers selected Brunell in the fifth round (118th overall) of the 1993 NFL draft. Brunell was the fourth quarterback drafted in 1993 and was the second quarterback drafted from Washington after Billy Joe Hobert was selected in the third round (58th overall) by the Los Angeles Raiders. This became only the second time two quarterbacks were drafted from the same school in the same draft. It was speculated that Brunell&#x27;s fall to the fifth round was due to fears that he might not be able to adapt to the pro game.

Brunell entered training camp as a backup quarterback and competed to be the primary backup against Ty Detmer. Brunell and Detmer ended up alternating as the primary backup quarterback, behind Brett Favre, throughout 1993 and 1994. As a rookie, Brunell did not appear in any games.

On October 20, 1994, Brunell made his professional regular season debut during a 13–10 overtime loss at the Minnesota Vikings in Week 8. Brunell entered the game during the second quarter after Brett Favre suffered a hip pointer. He immediately engineered a 49-yard drive that ended with his first career touchdown on a five-yard rush. Brunell finished the game completing 11 of 24 pass attempts for 79 passing yards and was held without a touchdown pass or interception.

Brunell became a restricted free agent after the 1994 NFL season and received a contract offer from the Philadelphia Eagles, who had just hired former Green Bay Packers’ defensive coordinator Ray Rhodes as their new head coach. Rhodes hired former Green Bay Packers’ wide receivers coach Jon Gruden to be the Philadelphia Eagles’ offensive coordinator and worked out a trade to acquire Brunell. Brunell was reluctant to accept the five-year contract offer from the Philadelphia Eagles as he did not want to spend his twenties as a backup quarterback behind Randall Cunningham. The Packers and Eagles agreed on the terms of a trade, but were unable to finalize the deal after Brunell declined to sign a long-term deal with the Philadelphia Eagles.

===Jacksonville Jaguars===
On 21 April 1995, in the first trade in the history of the new Jacksonville Jaguars, the franchise traded third (66th overall) and fifth round (170th overall) picks in the 1995 NFL draft to the Green Bay Packers in exchange for Brunell. The Jacksonville Jaguars signed Brunell to a three-year contract. Brunell started 13 games in 1995, completed 201 out of 346 passes, for 2,168 yards, with 15 touchdowns and 7 interceptions. He also rushed for 480 yards.
During his years in Jacksonville, Brunell was selected to the Pro Bowl three times, in 1997, 1998, and 2000 and awarded the Pro Bowl MVP in the 1997 game. With Brunell starting, the Jaguars won an AFC Central Division title and became the first NFL expansion team to make the playoffs three times in its first four seasons of play. The furthest he led the team was to the 1996 AFC Championship Game, which they lost to the New England Patriots. They returned again in 1999, but would lose to the Tennessee Titans.

Brunell was benched in favor of Byron Leftwich following halftime of the third game of the 2003 season. It would be the final time Brunell took the field as a member of the Jaguars. As a starter since their inaugural season, Brunell left the team holding all of the Jacksonville Jaguars passing records.

In December 2013, Brunell was inducted into the Pride of the Jaguars, the team&#x27;s Hall of Fame equivalent.

===Washington Redskins===
He was traded to the Washington Redskins prior to the 2004 season.

During the 2004 season, limited by a hamstring injury, Brunell struggled and would be benched midseason for backup quarterback Patrick Ramsey. Ramsey&#x27;s play towards the end of that season and following pre-season would lead to a quarterback controversy where Brunell would be benched going into the 2005 season. This would change in 2005 after Ramsey suffered an early season injury that thrust Brunell back into the starter&#x27;s role.

In 2005, Brunell played much better and led the team to a 10–6 record and a playoff victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He finished third in the 2005 NFL Comeback Player of the Year awards.

Brunell&#x27;s most prolific moment in the 2005 season was during Week 2, when he completed two long passes to wide receiver Santana Moss for two touchdowns in the final four minutes of the fourth quarter to defeat the Dallas Cowboys on Monday Night Football, 14–13.

On September 24, 2006, Brunell broke the NFL record for most consecutive completions in single game when he completed his first 22 passes against the Houston Texans. Brunell also set the Redskins franchise record for highest completion percentage in a single game (88.9%). The previous record was held by Hall of Fame quarterback Sammy Baugh for 66 years (87.5%).
On November 13, 2006, after winning only three of their first nine games of 2006, Brunell was benched in favor of Jason Campbell, Washington&#x27;s 2005 first round draft pick.

===New Orleans Saints===
On March 13, 2008, Brunell was signed by the New Orleans Saints. As the Saints have not issued number 8 since Archie Manning retired, Brunell changed his jersey number to 11, the only time in his career he would wear a jersey number besides his customary number 8.
He entered the 2008 season as the backup to Drew Brees, appearing in just two games. In 2009, he appeared in all 16 games as the holder on the Saints place-kicking unit, and saw his first playing time at quarterback in three years during a week 17 loss to the Carolina Panthers, as the Saints had already clinched homefield advantage and rested starter Drew Brees, as well as many other starters. Although he played little for the Saints, he was noted for his role as a veteran advisor to the Saints&#x27; starting quarterback, Drew Brees.

During the Saints playoff run on January 24, 2010, Brunell was the holder on the 40-yard field goal kicked by Garrett Hartley in overtime against the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC Championship Game to send the New Orleans Saints to the team&#x27;s first ever Super Bowl. On February 7, 2010, for the Super Bowl, Brunell served as the backup QB behind Drew Brees, and the holder for Garrett Hartley. Brunell and Hartley&#x27;s role as the kicking unit helped the Saints convert some critical kicks, going 3 for 3 on three long field goals (46 yards, 44 yards, 47 yards), and an extra point, to score a total of 10 points in the first three quarters, helping keep the score close going into the fourth quarter, with the Saints down by only one point (16–17). The Colts would never score again, as the momentum shifted the Saints way. Brunell earned his first and only Super Bowl ring with the New Orleans Saints when the team won its first franchise championship by defeating the Indianapolis Colts 31–17 in Super Bowl XLIV.

===New York Jets===
Brunell was a free agent after the 2009 season, and did not re-sign with the Saints. On July 28, 2010, he signed a two-year deal to play for the New York Jets. Brunell completed his first pass for the Jets on October 3 against the Buffalo Bills. In the last regular game of the 2010 season, while filling in for starting quarterback Mark Sanchez, Brunell threw his first scoring pass since 2006, a 17-yard touchdown pass to Santonio Holmes with 15 seconds left in the opening half. He then went on to throw a second scoring pass for 52 yards to Braylon Edwards in the second half. Brunell sat on the bench as the Jets made it to the AFC Championship but eventually lost to the Steelers 24–19.

After one season with the Jets, he was released on July 29, 2011. He was re-signed two days later at a reduced salary.

In April 2012, Brunell stated that he would like to play another season if the opportunity presented itself, contradicting a report from the &quot;Florida Times-Union&quot; that he was ready to retire.

===Legacy===
When Washington Redskins quarterback Jason Campbell, who played quarterback for the team after Brunell, was asked what player he learned the most from in his career, Campbell said it was Mark Brunell. Campbell said &quot;a nice tribute about how the man he replaced helped him become a better person off the field.&quot;

In 2012, Football Nation ranked Brunell the twenty-ninth best quarterback of the post-merger era.

<doc id="682476" wikidata="Q320491" url="?curid=682476" title="Ahmed Ghailani">
<text>Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani (, &quot;Aḥmad Khalifān al-Ghaīlānī&quot;; born March 14, 1974) is a Tanzanian conspirator of the al-Qaeda terrorist organization convicted for his role in the bombing of embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. He was indicted in the United States as a participant in the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings. He was on the FBI Most Wanted Terrorists list from its inception in October 2001. In 2004, he was captured and detained by Pakistani forces in a joint operation with the United States, and was held until June 9, 2009, at Guantanamo Bay detention camp; one of 14 Guantanamo detainees who had previously been held at secret locations abroad. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Ghailani told military officers he is contrite and claimed to be an exploited victim of al-Qaeda operatives.

Ghailani was transported from Guantanamo Bay to New York City to await trial in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in June 2009. When the case came to trial, the judge disallowed the testimony of a key witness. On November 17, 2010, a jury found him guilty of one count of conspiracy, but acquitted him of 284 other charges including all murder counts. Critics of the Obama administration said the verdict proves civilian courts cannot be trusted to prosecute terrorists since it shows a jury might acquit a defendant entirely. Supporters of the trial have said that the conviction and the stiff sentencing prove that the federal justice system works.

On January 25, 2011, U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, the presiding judge in the case, sentenced Ghailani, believed to be 36 years old at the time, to life in prison for the bombing, stating that any suffering Ghailani experienced at the hands of the CIA or other agencies while in custody at Guantanamo Bay pales in comparison to the monumental tragedy of the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, and left thousands injured or otherwise impacted by the crimes. The attacks were one of the deadliest non-wartime incidents of international terrorism to affect the United States; they were on a scale not surpassed until the September 11 attacks three years later. Ghailani, who had said he was never involved and did not intend to kill anyone, had been portrayed as cooperating with investigators—yielding information wanted by investigators—and as remorseful by his defense counsel, but that argument of relative non-involvement or remorse was not accepted. He is the fifth person to be sentenced. Four others were sentenced to life in prison in a 2001 trial in Manhattan federal court. Osama bin Laden was also named in the indictment.

==Early life==
Ghailani was born in 1974 in Zanzibar, Tanzania and is a Tanzanian citizen. He speaks Swahili and had served as a tabligh, a Muslim traveling preacher. The &quot;Denver Post&quot; printed a profile of Jeffrey Colwell, a former colonel in the United States Marine Corps, who had prepared to defend Ghailani, when he was in military custody. Colwell visited Ghailani&#x27;s family in Tanzania, in addition to getting to know Ghailani himself. According to Colwell &quot;he was a young kid at that time who was sort of lured and used as a pawn.&quot;

==1998 U.S. embassy bombings==
After joining al-Qaeda, he became an explosives expert and was assigned to obtain the bomb components in Dar es Salaam according to convicted fellow Embassy bombing conspirators Mohammed Sadiq Odeh and Khalfan Khamis Mohamed. This role was complicated by the fact that Ghailani could not drive so whatever purchases were too large or heavy for his bicycle such as oxygen and acetylene tanks would have to be picked up by another person in a car. Ghailani was in Nairobi, Kenya by August 6, 1998, where he is thought to have rented a room at the Hilltop Hotel used for meetings by the bombers and flew to Karachi on a Kenya Airways flight before the bombs exploded. At some time in Pakistan or Afghanistan, he married an Uzbek.

==Wanted and arrest for terrorist activities==
On May 26, 2004, United States Attorney General John Ashcroft and FBI Director Robert Mueller announced that reports indicated that Ghailani was one of seven al-Qaeda members who were planning a terrorist action for the summer or fall of 2004. The other alleged terrorists named on that date were Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, who had also been earlier listed with Ghailani by the FBI as a Most Wanted Terrorist for the 1998 embassy attack, and Abderraouf Jdey, Amer El-Maati, Aafia Siddiqui, Adam Yahiye Gadahn, and Adnan G. El Shukrijumah. Abderraouf Jdey was already on the FBI Seeking Information – War on Terrorism list since January 17, 2002, to which the other four were added as well.

American Democrats labeled the warning &quot;suspicious&quot;. Dismissing the threat, they claimed it was solely to divert attention from President Bush&#x27;s plummeting poll numbers and to push the failings of the Invasion of Iraq off the front page. CSIS director Reid Morden voiced similar concerns, saying it seemed more like &quot;election year&quot; politics, than an actual threat—and &quot;The New York Times&quot; pointed out that one day before the announcement, they had been told by the Department of Homeland Security that there were no current risks.

His arrest was made by the Intelligence Bureau Pakistan in a raid with police commandos. On July 25, 2004, a nearly eight-hour battle ensued in the town of Gujrat, Pakistan between security officials and terrorists. Ghailani and thirteen others, included his wife and children, were arrested. A police officer was wounded in the battle. Pakistani Interior Minister Makhdoom Faisal Saleh Hayat announced the capture of Ghailani on July 29, 2004. The US Government had offered a $5,000,000 USD bounty offered for information leading to the arrest of Ghailani.

Some press reports (including the American magazine &quot;New Republic&quot;) questioned whether the timing of the announcement of Ghailani&#x27;s capture was politically motivated. The announcement was made just hours before U.S. Presidential candidate John Kerry was due to make his acceptance speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, an event at which a candidate usually receives a significant boost in the polls. Hayyat made the announcement after midnight local time, despite having apparently known Ghailiani&#x27;s identity for some days beforehand. Pakistani officials denied there was any such motivation. Soon after the capture of Ghailani and the others with him, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, quoting a United Nations source, said that Ghailani was one of several al-Qaeda personnel who had been in Liberia around 2001, handling conflict diamonds under the protection of then-dictator Charles Taylor.

==Combatant Status Review==

Ghailani was among the 60% of prisoners who participated in the tribunal hearings. A Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for the tribunal of each detainee. The Ghailani memo accused him of the following:

The Department of Defense announced on August 9, 2007, that all fourteen of the &quot;high-value detainees&quot; who had been transferred to Guantanamo from the CIA&#x27;s black sites, had been officially classified as &quot;enemy combatants&quot;. Although judges Peter Brownback and Keith J. Allred had ruled two months earlier that only &quot;&quot;illegal&quot; enemy combatants&quot; could face military commissions, the Department of Defense waived the qualifier and said that all fourteen men could now face charges before Guantanamo military commissions.

==Charged before a military commission==

The al-Qaeda suspect alleged to have been involved in the 1998 United States embassy bombings that killed 223 people and injured approximately 4,085 faced nine war crimes charges, six of them offenses that could have carried the death penalty, if he was convicted by a military tribunal, it was reported on March 31, 2008. Scott L. Fenstermaker and David Remes were in a rare dispute as to who was authorized to assist Ghaliani.

In June 2009, Ghailani was transferred to New York to face trial in a federal court. The Department of Justice, under U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, directed the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara, not to seek the death penalty in an October 2009 memorandum.

==Transfer to the United States==
On August 31, 2009, &quot;Corrections One&quot;, a trade journal for the prison industry, speculated that Ghailani was one of ten detainees they speculated might be moved to a maximum security prison in Standish, Michigan. Instead, Ghailani was transferred to New York City to stand trial in a civilian court there. He learned that being transferred from military to civilian jurisdiction meant that he could no longer be assisted by Colonel Jeffrey Colwell and Major Richard Reiter.

On February 10, 2010, United States district court Judge Lewis A. Kaplan ordered the Prosecution to review the record of Ghailani&#x27;s detention in CIA&#x27;s network of black sites. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot; any materials that showed the decisions “were for a purpose other than national security” had to be turned over to Ghailani&#x27;s lawyers. It was reported that Kaplan was considering dismissing the charges on the grounds that due to Ghailani&#x27;s long extrajudicial detention he had been denied the constitutional right to a speedy trial.

On April 23, 2010, a 52-page unclassified summary of Ghailani&#x27;s 2007 Guantanamo interrogations was published in preparation for his trial.

Benjamin Weiser, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the summary, published during Ghailani&#x27;s civilian trial, revealed new details about his life as an Osama bin Laden bodyguard. According to Weiser, the interrogation summary asserted that during the year he was a bodyguard Ghailani met several other individuals who were among those who later became hijackers in the September 11 attacks. Following his work as a bodyguard, the summary asserts Ghailani became a forger, where he became &quot;very good with Photoshop&quot;.
Ghailani&#x27;s trial commenced on October 4, 2010, in the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Federal Court Building in lower Manhattan, in front of U.S. District Court Judge Lewis A. Kaplan. There were no protests or demonstrations during the trial, as observed by Human Rights First.

On October 6, 2010, in a short ruling that the judge said he would expand upon later that day, it was determined that a key witness, the Tanzanian Hussein Abebe, who may have issued statements crucial to implicating Ghailani during the time he was under CIA custody, would not be testifying in the trial. Judge Kaplan agreed to delay the start of the trial until the following Tuesday, October 12, 2010, pending a possible appeal of that ruling. On October 11, 2010, the government announced it would not appeal Judge Kaplan&#x27;s ruling. Steve Zissou, one of Ghailani&#x27;s lawyers, commented that the government&#x27;s decision not to appeal was &quot;a significant victory for the Constitution&quot;.

On November 17, 2010, Ghailani was convicted of conspiracy, but acquitted of all the other charges. On January 25, 2011, Ghailani was sentenced to life in prison.

On May 10, 2019, Ghailani was transferred from ADX Florence in Colorado, to United States Penitentiary, McCreary, in Kentucky as BOP number 02476-748.

<text>Chinese cabbage (&quot;Brassica rapa&quot;, subspecies &quot;pekinensis&quot; and &quot;chinensis&quot;) is either of two cultivar groups of leaf vegetables often used in Chinese cuisine: the Pekinensis Group (napa cabbage) and the Chinensis Group (bok choy).

These vegetables are both variant cultivars or subspecies of &quot;B. rapa&quot; and belong to the same genus as such Western staples as cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower. Both have many variations in name, spelling, and scientific classification, especially bok choy cultivars.

==History==
The Chinese cabbage was principally grown in the Yangtze River Delta region, but the Ming dynasty naturalist Li Shizhen popularized it by bringing attention to its medicinal qualities. The variant cultivated in Zhejiang around the 14th century was brought north, and the northern harvest of napa cabbage soon exceeded the southern one. These were then exported back south along the Grand Canal to Hangzhou and traded by sea as far south as Guangdong.

Napa cabbage became a staple in Northeastern Chinese cuisine for making &quot;suan cai&quot;, Chinese sauerkraut. In Korea, napa cabbage became &quot;baek-kimchi&quot;, which developed into kimchi. Chinese cabbage is now commonly found in markets throughout the world, catering both to the Chinese diaspora and to northern markets that appreciate its resistance to cold.

In 2017, aboard the International Space Station, a crop of Chinese cabbage from a plant growth device included an allotment for crew consumption, while the rest was saved for scientific study.

==Cultivar groups==
There are two distinct groups of &quot;Brassica rapa&quot; used as leaf vegetables in China, and a wide range of cultivars within these two groups. The binomial name &quot;B. campestris&quot; is also used.

===Pekinensis Group===
This group is the more common of the two, especially outside Asia; names such as napa cabbage, &quot;dà báicài&quot; (, &quot;large white vegetable&quot;); &quot;Baguio petsay&quot; or &quot;petsay wombok&quot; (Tagalog); &quot;Chinese white cabbage&quot;; &quot;wong a pak&quot; (Hokkien, Fujianese); &quot;baechu&quot; (), &quot;wongbok&quot;; &quot;hakusai&quot; () and &quot;suann-tang-pe̍h-á&quot; (Taiwanese) usually refer to members of this group. Pekinensis Group cabbages have broad green leaves with white petioles, tightly wrapped in a cylindrical formation and usually forming a compact head. As the group name indicates, this is particularly popular in northern China around Beijing (Peking).

===Chinensis Group===
Chinensis Group cultivars do not form heads; instead, they have smooth, dark green leaf blades forming a cluster reminiscent of mustard or celery. These cultivars are popular in southern China and Southeast Asia. Being winter-hardy, they are increasingly grown in Northern Europe. This group was originally classified as its own species under the name &quot;B. chinensis&quot; by Linnaeus.

<text>Jackson System Development (JSD) is a linear software development methodology developed by Michael A. Jackson and John Cameron in the 1980s.

== History ==
JSD was first presented by Michael A. Jackson in 1982, in a paper called &quot;A System Development Method&quot;. and in 1983 in &quot;System Development&quot;.
Jackson System Development (JSD) is a method of system development that covers the software life cycle either directly or, by providing a framework into which more specialized techniques can fit. Jackson System Development can start from the stage in a project when there is only a general statement of requirements. However, many projects that have used Jackson System Development actually started slightly later in the life cycle, doing the first steps largely from existing documents rather than directly with the users. The later steps of JSD produce the code of the final system. Jackson’s first method, Jackson Structured Programming (JSP), is used to produce the final code. The output of the earlier steps of JSD are a set of program design problems, the design of which is the subject matter of JSP. Maintenance is also addressed by reworking whichever of the earlier steps are appropriate.

JSD continued to evolve, and a few new features were introduced into the method. These are described in a 1989 collection of papers by John Cameron, &quot;JSP and JSD&quot;, and in the 1992 version (version 2) of the LBMS JSD manual.

Development of the JSD method came to an end in the early 1990s as Jackson&#x27;s thinking evolved into the Problem Frames Approach with the publication of &quot;Software Requirements and Specifications&quot; (1995) and &quot;Problem Frames: Analyzing and Structuring Software Development Problems&quot; (2000).

== Principles of operation ==
Three basic principles of operation of JSD is that:
* Development must start with describing and modelling the real world, rather than specifying or structuring the function performed by the system. A system made using JSD method performs the simulation of the real world before any direct attention is paid to function or purpose of the system.
* An adequate model of a time-ordered world must itself be time-ordered. Main aim is to map progress in the real world on progress in the system that models it.
* The way of implementing the system is based on transformation of specification into efficient set of processes. These processes should be designed in such a manner that it would be possible to run them on available software and hardware.

== JSD steps ==
When it was originally presented by Jackson in 1982, the method consisted of six steps:

# Entity/action step
# Initial model step
# Interactive function step
# Information function step
# System timing step
# System implementation step

Later, some steps were combined to create a method with only three steps.
# Modelling stage (analysis): with the &quot;entity/action step&quot; and &quot;entity structures step&quot;.
# Network stage (design): with the &quot;initial model step&quot;, &quot;function step&quot;, and &quot;system timing step&quot;.
# Implementation stage (realisation): the implementation step.

=== Modeling stage ===
In the modeling stage the designer creates a collection of &quot;entity structure diagrams&quot; and identifies the entities in the system, the actions they perform, the time-ordering of the actions in the life of the entities, and the attributes of the actions and entities. Entity structure diagrams use the diagramming notation of Jackson Structured Programming &quot;structure diagrams&quot;. Purpose of these diagrams is to create a full description of the aspects of the system and the organisation. Developers have to decide which things are important and which are not. Good communication between developers and users of the new system is very important.

This stage is the combination of the former entity/action step and the entity structures step.

=== Network stage ===
In the network stage a model of the system as a whole is developed and represented as a &quot;system specification diagram&quot; (SSD) (also known as a &quot;network diagram&quot;). Network diagrams show processes (rectangles) and how they communicate with each other, either via &quot;state vector&quot; connections (diamonds) or via &quot;datastream&quot; connections (circles). In this stage, the functionality of the system is defined. Each entity becomes a process or program in the network diagram. External programs are later added to the network diagrams. The purpose of these programs is to process input, calculate output and to keep the entity processes up-to-date. The whole system is described with these network diagrams and are completed with descriptions about the data and connections between the processes and programs.

The initial model step specifies a simulation of the real world. The function step adds to this simulation the further executable operations and processes needed to produce output of the system. System timing step provides synchronisation among processes, introduces constraints. This stage is the combination of the former ‘Initial model’ step, the ‘function’ step and the ‘system timing’ step.

=== Implementation stage ===
In the implementation stage the abstract network model of the solution is converted into a physical system, represented as a &quot;system implementation diagram&quot; (SID). The SID shows the system as a &quot;scheduler&quot; process that calls modules that implement the processes. Datastreams are represented as calls to inverted processes. Database symbols represent collections of entity state-vectors, and there are special symbols for file buffers (which must be implemented when processes are scheduled to run at different time intervals).

The central concern of implementation step is optimization of the system. It is necessary to reduce the number of processes because it is impossible to provide each process that is contained in specification with its own virtual processor. By means of transformation, processes are combined in order to limit their number to the number of processors.

=== Designing the diagrams ===
;Entity structure diagram (ESD)
The diagram shows how the action entities cooperate with the system. Entity structure diagram (ESD) notations:
* &quot;Entity&quot;: An entity is an object that is used on the system and by the system.
* &quot;Action&quot;: The actions that are carried out by entities and the actions that affect other entities.
* &quot;Construct-sequence&quot;: The JSD construct is identical to the SSADM Entity Life History construct. Use a SequenceConstruct to illustrate actions that are applied from left to right.
* &quot;Construct-selection&quot;: To reflect a choice between two or more actions. Mark the options in the topright corner with a &quot;o&quot; (option).
* &quot;Construct-recurrence&quot;: When an action repeats, place a small asterisk (*) in the topright corner.
Normally there would be only one action underneath a RecurringConstruct.
* &quot; Null component&quot;: A Null component can make sure nothing happens in an IF-ELSE statement.

;Network diagram (ND)
Network diagrams show the interaction between the processes. Sometimes they are referred to as system specification diagrams (SSDs). Network diagram (ND) notations:
* &quot;Process&quot;: Processes represent system functions. A process model represents the primary system functions. It generally has a relation with an outside entity through the datastream.
* &quot;Datastream connection&quot;: In a datastream connection, process A (the entity that writes the datastream) actively sends information to another process B.
* &quot;State vector inspection&quot;: In a state vector connection, process B (the entity that reads the state vector information) reads the state vector information of another entity A.

The difference between a state vector connection and a data stream connection lies in which process is active. In a datastream connection, the process with the information, A, is the active process; it actively sends a message to the datastream reader B at a time that it (A, the sender) chooses. In a state vector inspection, the process with the information, A, is passive; it does nothing but let the reader process B inspect its (A&#x27;s) state vector. B, the process doing the inspection, is the active process; it decides when it will read information from A. Roughly speaking, datastream connection is an abstraction of message passing, while state vector inspection is an abstraction for polling (and for database retrieval).
