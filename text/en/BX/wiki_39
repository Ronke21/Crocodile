<text>Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts, commonly referred to as Lang, is the seminar-style, undergraduate, liberal arts college of The New School. It is located on-campus in Greenwich Village in New York City on West 11th Street off 6th Avenue.

==History==
Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts was founded as the Freshman Year Program at The New School in 1972 as a pre-college program for high school graduates. Three years later, in 1975, the program was expanded to a full undergraduate program and renamed The Seminar College. In 1985, following a generous donation by Eugene Lang and his wife Theresa, the school was renamed Eugene Lang College. The college currently has an enrollment of over 1,555 students.

In 2005, the phrase &quot;The New School&quot; was inserted into the name of each division of The New School as part of a unification strategy initiated by the university&#x27;s President Bob Kerrey; thus, Eugene Lang College was renamed Eugene Lang College The New School for Liberal Arts. In 2015, The New School rebranded again by renaming the schools to better clarify the relationship between the university and its schools. Eugene Lang College&#x27;s formal title is The New School&#x27;s Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts.

==Curriculum==
===Academics===
The only required classes are a First-Year Seminar and two semesters of Writing the Essay for first-year students. These intensive writing classes have titles such as &quot;Memory and the Self,&quot; &quot;Poetry and the Conditions of Possibility,&quot; &quot;Human Rights,&quot; and &quot;Technology, Surveillance, and Climate Change.&quot; Students are encouraged to tailor their academic programs to their own interests and goals.

Eugene Lang College hosts some of The New School&#x27;s most experimental and avant-garde courses, including: &quot;Heterodox Identities&quot;, &quot;NYC: Graphic Gotham&quot;, &quot;The Mind-Game Film&quot; (taught by Silvia Vega-Llona), &quot;The Illusion of Color&quot;, &quot;Punk &amp; Noise&quot;, &quot;Masculinity in Asia,&quot; &quot;Queer Culture&quot;, &quot;Theories of Mind&quot;, and &quot;Play and Toil in the Digital Sweatshop&quot;.

The college places emphasis on interdisciplinary learning with a &quot;student-directed&quot; curriculum. All of its courses are seminars. Students at Lang may also cross-register for courses sponsored by other divisions of The New School, including Parsons School of Design and The New School College of Performing Arts. Students are allowed to double-major, minor in programs across The New School, and enroll in the bachelor&#x27;s/master&#x27;s program, which allows Lang students to complete a BA and MA through The New School&#x27;s graduate programs.

==Student publications==
Several of The New School&#x27;s major publications are produced by Lang students. Among these are: 
* &quot;The New School Free Press&quot; , a student-run newspaper published by the journalism concentration of the Writing department, has grown from a DIY zine-style pamphlet to a professionally printed broadsheet in the years since its founding in 2002, when it was known as &quot;Inprint&quot;. It is published monthly in print and it aims to serve both Lang and the wider New School community. The Free Press operates a blog and makes digital copies of the newspaper available on the Lang website.
* &quot;12th Street&quot;, nationally distributed literary journal; contains works from undergraduate writers in The New School&#x27;s Riggio Writing &amp; Democracy Honors Program
* &quot;Eleven and a Half&quot;, the literary journal of Eugene Lang College
* &quot;The Weekly Observer&quot;, an online newsletter showcasing major student and alumni achievements, special program announcements, and other university-wide news. Distributed via MyNewSchool web portal.

<text>Jules Pierre Verreaux (24 August 1807 – 7 September 1873) was a French botanist and ornithologist and a professional collector of and trader in natural history specimens. He was the brother of Édouard Verreaux and nephew of Pierre Antoine Delalande.

==Career==
Verreaux worked for the family business, Maison Verreaux, established in 1803 by his father, Jacques Philippe Verreaux, at Place des Vosges in Paris, which was the earliest known company that dealt in objects of natural history. The company funded collection expeditions to various parts of the world. Maison Verreaux sold many specimens to the Muséum National d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle to add to its collections.

In 1830, while travelling in modern-day Botswana, Verreaux witnessed the burial of a Tswana warrior. Verreaux returned to the burial site under cover of night to dig up the African&#x27;s body where he retrieved the skin, the skull and a few bones. Verreaux intended to ship the body back to France and so prepared and preserved the African warrior&#x27;s corpse by using metal wire as a spine, wooden boards as shoulder blades and newspaper as a stuffing material. Then he shipped the body to Paris along with a batch of stuffed animals in crates. In 1831, the African&#x27;s body appeared in a showroom at No. 3, Rue Saint Fiacre. He was later known as Negro of Banyoles, after being acquired by Francesc Darder, who exhibited it at the 1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition, and later moved it to the Darder Museum in Banyoles, Catalonia. It was only in the 1990s, following a campaign initiated by Dr Alphonse Arcelin, the mummified corpse was returned and buried in Botswana.

Verreaux travelled to Australia in 1842 to collect plants. He returned to France in 1851 with a natural history collection reported to contain 15,000 items. In 1864 he took over from Florent Prévost as assistant naturalist at the Paris Museum.

Verreaux also worked in China and South Africa, where he helped Andrew Smith found the South African Museum in Cape Town in 1825.

==Legacy==
He is commemorated in the names of: 
*Verreaux&#x27;s eagle (&quot;Aquila verreauxii)&quot;, 
*Verreaux&#x27;s eagle-owl (&quot;Bubo lacteus)&quot;, 
*Verreaux&#x27;s coua (&quot;Coua verreauxi)&quot;, 
*Verreaux&#x27;s sifaka (&quot;Propithecus verreauxi)&quot;, 
*the white-tipped dove (&quot;Leptotila verreauxi)&quot;, 
*the golden parrotbill (&quot;Paradoxornis verreauxi)&quot;, 
*Verreaux&#x27;s skink (&quot;Anomalopus verreauxii)&quot;, and the 
*Andaman giant gecko (&quot;Gekko verreauxi)&quot;.
*The Southern Conger Eel &quot;Conger verreauxi&quot; is also named after him.

<doc id="670376" wikidata="Q556030" url="?curid=670376" title="Power-flow study">
<text>In power engineering, the power-flow study, or load-flow study, is a numerical analysis of the flow of electric power in an interconnected system. A power-flow study usually uses simplified notations such as a one-line diagram and per-unit system, and focuses on various aspects of AC power parameters, such as Voltage, voltage angles, real power and reactive power. It analyzes the power systems in normal steady-state operation.

Power-flow or load-flow studies are important for planning future expansion of power systems as well as in determining the best operation of existing systems. The principal information obtained from the power-flow study is the magnitude and phase angle of the voltage at each bus, and the real and reactive power flowing in each line.

Commercial power systems are usually too complex to allow for hand solution of the power flow. Special-purpose network analyzers were built between 1929 and the early 1960s to provide laboratory-scale physical models of power systems. Large-scale digital computers replaced the analog methods with numerical solutions.

In addition to a power-flow study, computer programs perform related calculations such as short-circuit fault analysis, stability studies (transient and steady-state), unit commitment and economic dispatch. In particular, some programs use linear programming to find the &quot;optimal power flow&quot;, the conditions which give the lowest cost per kilowatt hour delivered.

A load flow study is especially valuable for a system with multiple load centers, such as a refinery complex. The power-flow study is an analysis of the system’s capability to adequately supply the connected load. The total system losses, as well as individual line losses, also are tabulated. Transformer tap positions are selected to ensure the correct voltage at critical locations such as motor control centers. Performing a load-flow study on an existing system provides insight and recommendations as to the system operation and optimization of control settings to obtain maximum capacity while minimizing the operating costs. The results of such an analysis are in terms of active power, reactive power, voltage magnitude and phase angle. Furthermore, power-flow computations are crucial for optimal operations of groups of generating units.

In term of its approach to uncertainties, load-flow study can be divided to deterministic load flow and uncertainty-concerned load flow. Deterministic load-flow study does not take into account the uncertainties arising from both power generations and load behaviors. To take the uncertainties into consideration, there are several approaches that has been used such as probabilistic, possibilistic, information gap decision theory, robust optimization, and interval analysis.

==Model==
An alternating current power-flow model is a model used in electrical engineering to analyze power grids. It provides a nonlinear system of equations which describes the energy flow through each transmission line. The problem is non-linear because the power flow into load impedances is a function of the square of the applied voltages. Due to nonlinearity, in many cases the analysis of large network via AC power-flow model is not feasible, and a linear (but less accurate) DC power-flow model is used instead.

Usually analysis of a three-phase power system is simplified by assuming balanced loading of all three phases. Sinusoidal steady-state operation is assumed, with no transient changes in power flow or voltage due to load or generation changes, meaning all current and voltage waveforms are sinusoidal with no DC offset and have the same constant frequency. The previous assumption is the same as assuming the power system is linear time-invariant (even though the system of equations is nonlinear), driven by sinusoidal sources of same frequency, and operating in steady-state, which allows to use phasor analysis, another simplification. A further simplification is to use the per-unit system to represent all voltages, power flows, and impedances, scaling the actual target system values to some convenient base. A system one-line diagram is the basis to build a mathematical model of the generators, loads, buses, and transmission lines of the system, and their electrical impedances and ratings.

==Power-flow problem formulation==
The goal of a power-flow study is to obtain complete voltage angles and magnitude information for each bus in a power system for specified load and generator real power and voltage conditions. Once this information is known, real and reactive power flow on each branch as well as generator reactive power output can be analytically determined. Due to the nonlinear nature of this problem, numerical methods are employed to obtain a solution that is within an acceptable tolerance.

The solution to the power-flow problem begins with identifying the known and unknown variables in the system. The known and unknown variables are dependent on the type of bus. A bus without any generators connected to it is called a Load Bus. With one exception, a bus with at least one generator connected to it is called a Generator Bus. The exception is one arbitrarily-selected bus that has a generator. This bus is referred to as the slack bus.

In the power-flow problem, it is assumed that the real power formula_1 and reactive power formula_2 at each Load Bus are known. For this reason, Load Buses are also known as PQ Buses. For Generator Buses, it is assumed that the real power generated formula_3 and the voltage magnitude formula_4 is known. For the Slack Bus, it is assumed that the voltage magnitude formula_4 and voltage phase formula_6 are known. Therefore, for each Load Bus, both the voltage magnitude and angle are unknown and must be solved for; for each Generator Bus, the voltage angle must be solved for; there are no variables that must be solved for the Slack Bus. In a system with formula_7 buses and formula_8 generators, there are then formula_9 unknowns.

In order to solve for the formula_9 unknowns, there must be formula_9 equations that do not introduce any new unknown variables. The possible equations to use are power balance equations, which can be written for real and reactive power for each bus.
The real power balance equation is:

formula_12

where formula_13 is the net active power injected at bus &quot;i&quot;, formula_14 is the real part of the element in the bus admittance matrix YBUS corresponding to the formula_15 row and formula_16 column, formula_17 is the imaginary part of the element in the YBUS corresponding to the formula_15 row and formula_16 column and formula_20 is the difference in voltage angle between the formula_15 and formula_16 buses (formula_23). The reactive power balance equation is:

formula_24

where formula_25 is the net reactive power injected at bus &quot;i&quot;.

Equations included are the real and reactive power balance equations for each Load Bus and the real power balance equation for each Generator Bus. Only the real power balance equation is written for a Generator Bus because the net reactive power injected is assumed to be unknown and therefore including the reactive power balance equation would result in an additional unknown variable. For similar reasons, there are no equations written for the Slack Bus.

In many transmission systems, the impedance of the power network lines is primarily inductive, i.e. the phase angles of the power lines impedance are usually relatively large and very close to 90 degrees. There is thus a strong coupling between real power and voltage angle, and between reactive power and voltage magnitude, while the coupling between real power and voltage magnitude, as well as reactive power and voltage angle, is weak. As a result, real power is usually transmitted from the bus with higher voltage angle to the bus with lower voltage angle, and reactive power is usually transmitted from the bus with higher voltage magnitude to the bus with lower voltage magnitude. However, this approximation does not hold when the phase angle of the power line impedance is relatively small.

==Newton–Raphson solution method==
There are several different methods of solving the resulting nonlinear system of equations. The most popular is a variation of the Newton–Raphson method. The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative method which begins with initial guesses of all unknown variables (voltage magnitude and angles at Load Buses and voltage angles at Generator Buses). Next, a Taylor Series is written, with the higher order terms ignored, for each of the power balance equations included in the system of equations. The result is a linear system of equations that can be expressed as:

formula_26

where formula_27 and formula_28 are called the mismatch equations:

formula_29
formula_30

and formula_31 is a matrix of partial derivatives known as a Jacobian:
formula_32.

The linearized system of equations is solved to determine the next guess (&quot;m&quot; + 1) of voltage magnitude and angles based on:

formula_33
formula_34

The process continues until a stopping condition is met. A common stopping condition is to terminate if the norm of the mismatch equations is below a specified tolerance.

A rough outline of solution of the power-flow problem is:
# Make an initial guess of all unknown voltage magnitudes and angles. It is common to use a &quot;flat start&quot; in which all voltage angles are set to zero and all voltage magnitudes are set to 1.0 p.u.
# Solve the power balance equations using the most recent voltage angle and magnitude values.
# Linearize the system around the most recent voltage angle and magnitude values
# Solve for the change in voltage angle and magnitude
# Update the voltage magnitude and angles
# Check the stopping conditions, if met then terminate, else go to step 2.

==Other power-flow methods==
* Gauss–Seidel method: This is the earliest devised method. It shows slower rates of convergence compared to other iterative methods, but it uses very little memory and does not need to solve a matrix system.
* Fast-decoupled-load-flow method is a variation on Newton–Raphson that exploits the approximate decoupling of active and reactive flows in well-behaved power networks, and additionally fixes the value of the Jacobian during the iteration in order to avoid costly matrix decompositions. Also referred to as &quot;fixed-slope, decoupled NR&quot;. Within the algorithm, the Jacobian matrix gets inverted only once, and there are three assumptions. Firstly, the conductance between the buses is zero. Secondly, the magnitude of the bus voltage is one per unit. Thirdly, the sine of phases between buses is zero. Fast decoupled load flow can return the answer within seconds whereas the Newton Raphson method takes much longer. This is useful for real-time management of power grids.
* Holomorphic embedding load flow method: A recently developed method based on advanced techniques of complex analysis. It is direct and guarantees the calculation of the correct (operative) branch, out of the multiple solutions present in the power-flow equations.
* Backward-Forward Sweep (BFS) method: A method developed to take advantage of the radial structure of most modern distribution grids. It involves choosing an initial voltage profile and separating the original system of equations of grid components into two separate systems and solving one, using the last results of the other, until convergence is achieved. Solving for the currents with the voltages given is called the backward sweep (BS) and solving for the voltages with the currents given is called the forward sweep (FS).
* Laurent Power Flow (LPF) method: Power flow formulation that provides guarantee of uniqueness of solution and independence on initial conditions for electrical distribution systems. The LPF is based on the current injection method (CIM) and applies the Laurent series expansion. The main characteristics of this formulation are its proven numerical convergence and stability, and its computational advantages, showing to be at least ten times faster than the BFS method both in balanced and unbalanced networks. Since it is based on the system&#x27;s admittance matrix, the formulation is able to consider radial and meshed network topologies without additional modifications (contrary to the compensation-based BFS). The simplicity and computational efficiency of the LPF method make it an attractive option for recursive power flow problems, such as those encountered in time-series analyses, metaheuristics, probabilistic analysis, reinforcement learning applied to power systems, and other related applications.

==DC power-flow==
Direct current load flow gives estimations of lines power flows on AC power systems. Direct current load flow looks only at active power flows and neglects reactive power flows. This method is non-iterative and absolutely convergent but less accurate than AC Load Flow solutions. Direct current load flow is used wherever repetitive and fast load flow estimations are required.

<text>Sébastien René Grosjean (; born 29 May 1978) is a French former professional tennis player. Grosjean reached the semifinals at the 2001 Australian and French Opens, and at Wimbledon in 2003 and 2004. He finished eight consecutive seasons ranked in the top 30 (1999–2006), peaking at world No. 4 in October 2002. Grosjean retired from professional tennis in May 2010.

In December 2018, he was named the Davis Cup captain for France. He is currently the director of the Open de Roanne.

==Career==
===Juniors===
As a junior, Grosjean posted a 90-20 singles record and a 58-12 doubles record, winning the 1996 French Open boys&#x27; doubles. He reached No. 1 in the world in both singles and doubles in December 1996.

===Pro tour===
Grosjean joined the professional tour in 1996. In 2003 and 2004, he reached the final of the Queen&#x27;s London Tournament. In the same two years, he also reached the semifinals of Wimbledon. He finished 2001 as the No. 1 player from his country and for the first time in the top 10 becoming the first Frenchman to finish a year in the top 10 since Cédric Pioline in 1993. In 2001, Grosjean won the Davis Cup with the French team.

Grosjean is known for his extreme forehand, his best shot, he utilizes something of a western grip, which is hit at high velocities. He has appeared in four Grand Slam semifinal matches. As well as his two Wimbledon runs, he also reached the French Open semifinals in 2001. His most famous chance was at the 2001 Australian Open against Arnaud Clément. Grosjean led two sets to love and had a match point in the fourth set before Clément prevailed. This was long considered the worst &#x27;choke&#x27; in five-set history, until the 2004 French Open final.

He won his fourth singles title at the 2007 Grand Prix de Tennis de Lyon, with a victory over countryman Marc Gicquel. He also won the doubles final with Jo-Wilfried Tsonga as a wildcard team, where they upset the first and third seeds.

Considered one of the more popular players on the circuit, he is lauded for his attractive, graceful style and classical skills. He is affectionately nicknamed &#x27;Big John&#x27; by fans, a literal translation of his surname into English.

==Personal life==
Grosjean married his wife Marie-Pierre on 16 November 1998 and has a daughter named Lola (born 11 October 1998), a son named Tom (2002), and a daughter named Sam (2006). The family resides in Boca Raton, Florida (U.S.), where Grosjean trains at the Evert Tennis Academy. He is sponsored by Lacoste in apparel and Head rackets. He used the Head Radical Tour TwinTube 630 XL under various paint jobs throughout his career.

<doc id="670380" wikidata="Q4934497" url="?curid=670380" title="Bob and Doug McKenzie">
<text>Bob and Doug McKenzie are a pair of fictional Canadian brothers who hosted &quot;Great White North&quot;, a sketch which was introduced on &quot;SCTV&quot; for the show&#x27;s third season when it moved to CBC Television in 1980. Bob is played by Rick Moranis and Doug is played by Dave Thomas. Although created originally as filler to both satisfy and mock network Canadian content demands, the duo became a pop culture phenomenon in both Canada and the United States. The characters became the focus of a bestselling comedy album, &quot;The Great White North&quot;, in 1981 and starred in a feature film, &quot;Strange Brew&quot;, in 1983. They were later revived for an animated series, &quot;Bob &amp; Doug&quot;, which premiered on Global in 2009.

==History==
&quot;Great White North&quot; (originally known as &quot;Kanadian Korner&quot;) is a panel show that played upon Canadian stereotypes. Bob and Doug, two dim-witted beer-swilling brothers wearing heavy winter clothing and tuques, would comment on various elements of Canadian life and culture, frequently employing the interjection &quot;Eh?&quot; and derisively calling each other &quot;hoser.&quot; Among the topics discussed were snow routes, the Canadian-built robot arm on the Space Shuttle, the inappropriateness of bedtime stories about dog fights, flat tires, and &quot;why there aren&#x27;t enough parking spaces at take-out donut shops.&quot;

The sketch was conceived when &quot;SCTV&quot; moved to the CBC television network. Due to the difference in the amount of time allocated for commercials, each episode to be broadcast on that network was two minutes longer than those syndicated to the United States. The CBC network heads asked the show&#x27;s producers to add specifically identifiably Canadian content for those two minutes, in line with government broadcast regulations. Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas thought that this was a ridiculous request, given that the show had been taped in Canada, with a mostly Canadian cast and crew, for two years. The request inspired them to create a parody that would incorporate every aspect of the humorous stereotype of Canadians.

The segments were videotaped at the end of a day&#x27;s shooting, with just Thomas and Moranis and a single camera operator. The sketches were for the most part improvised on the set, after which they would select the best ones for use on the program.

Moranis recalled, &quot;We went on the stage with no preparation, and did 15 [sketches]. Two of them were lousy, in three we cracked up and fell apart... maybe six were keepers.&quot; Added Dave Thomas in a 2000 interview, &quot;Rick and I used to sit in the studio, by ourselves – almost like happy hour – drink real beers, cook back bacon, literally make hot snack food for ourselves while we improvised and just talked. It was all very low key and stupid, and we thought, &#x27;Well, they get what they deserve. This is their Canadian content. I hope they like it.

To their shock, the comedians found that this filler material had become the most popular part of the show. Though initially intended for Canadian TV only, some of the two-minute &quot;Great White North&quot; segments would find their way into U.S. versions of the 30-minute shows due to a shortage of content that week. When NBC ordered the 90-minute shows for the 1981 season, they specifically cited good affiliate feedback on the &quot;two dumb Canadian characters&quot; and requested that the characters be included in every program.

They rode the crest of a fad, peaking in 1982–83, that produced one comedy album, &quot;The Great White North&quot;, and a movie, &quot;Strange Brew&quot;. The album released by Anthem Records in Canada and Mercury Records in the US, went platinum in sales, won a Grammy nomination and broke the Top 10 on Billboard&#x27;s Top LPs and Tapes list in March, 1982. It is noted for the song &quot;Take Off&quot; which featured fellow Canadian Geddy Lee of the rock group Rush chorusing between the McKenzies&#x27; banter. The song was #1 for 2 weeks on the CHUM Charts, December 12 and 19, 1981. On this album, they also sing their own improvised version of &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas&quot;, which is frequently played on the radio around the holidays in both Canada and the United States. While hugely popular in the U.S., the album was also #1 in Canada for six weeks, suggesting that Canadians appreciated the duo as an affectionate self-parody.

The &quot;Strange Brew&quot; movie was released by MGM in 1983. While receiving only minimal praise from critics, it performed fairly well at the box office — earning $8.5 million in the U.S. alone to cover its $4 million budget. After its theatrical release, &quot;Strange Brew&quot; remained a popular home-video title with a strong college cult following.

A second album, a &quot;soundtrack&quot; to their movie &quot;Strange Brew&quot;, was released in 1983. The album featured dialogue and music from the film, as well as new skits made specifically for the album that centred around the movie. The lead off track was appropriately entitled &quot;This Isn&#x27;t Our Second Album&quot;. The album sold poorly and was out-of-print soon after.

The sketch&#x27;s signature &quot;Coo loo coo coo, coo coo coo coo&quot; theme, according to Dave Thomas in an interview on &quot;CBC News: The Hour&quot;, is an exaggeration of the flute music used in 60-second Canadian television nature vignettes, such as &quot;Hinterland Who&#x27;s Who&quot;.

In 2023, Thomas and Moranis revived the characters for a Beer Canada commercial advocating for a freeze on new federal taxes on beer.

==Appearances on &quot;SCTV&quot;==
The duo had a total of 41 original segments on SCTV. Presumably filmed several at a time, most &quot;Great White North&quot; segments featured one two-minute sketch per SCTV episode. 25 segments were aired in the third season (1980–81).

Most of Season 4, Cycle 1 (1981) was made up of &quot;Great White North&quot; repeat segments. The only new appearances were in episodes 4/1-2 and 4/1-9, the final episode of the cycle. The final episode included a wraparound storyline which heavily featured the characters.

Growing in popularity, the characters returned for nine new segments in the second cycle of season 4. Cycle 2 (1981–82) featured a new &quot;Great White North&quot; segment in each episode.

Season 4, Cycle 3 (1982) was the last season to feature the characters. The first episode&#x27;s plot revolves around the growing popularity of Bob and Doug, and they are given their own variety show on &quot;SCTV&quot;, which turns into a catastrophe. The characters returned in the next episode for a new segment in their traditional studio set, but it had been cut to one minute (the episode&#x27;s storyline owing the reduced air time to their disastrous variety show). The two are then featured in three more new segments, each back to two minutes long, before Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas left &quot;SCTV&quot; to film &quot;Strange Brew&quot;.

==Legacy==
The duo revived the act in two award-winning television commercials for Pizza Hut in 1984 and 1986 and a two-year campaign for the Molson Brewing Company in 1999 and 2000 consisting of more than a dozen television and radio commercials which aired nationally in the U.S.

McFarlane Toys produced Bob and Doug McKenzie action figures in September 2000.

In the 2000 video game (and the 2018 remaster), the polar bear NPCs at the start and end of Icy Peak are named Bob and Doug.

In 2003, the fastest computer in Canada, which is used by the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Toronto, was named after Bob and Doug. The $900,000 computer is being used to simulate supermassive black holes and collisions of galaxies. The machine, nicknamed McKenzie, has 268 gigabytes of memory and 40 terabytes of disk space, and consists of two master nodes (Bob and Doug), 256 compute nodes, and eight development nodes.

They played a variant of the act for the Walt Disney Pictures animated feature film &quot;Brother Bear&quot; and its sequel, with their characters being the voices of a pair of goofy bull moose named Rutt and Tuke. They also recorded a commentary for the movie that is seen on the DVD.

A new special, &quot;Bob &amp; Doug McKenzie&#x27;s Two-Four Anniversary&quot;, aired on May 20, 2007, on CBC Television. It is a retrospective on the history of the characters and their popularity, featuring interviews with various celebrities, classic clips, and new material featuring the pair. It includes an introduction by former Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin and a cameo appearance by Rush lead singer Geddy Lee. On November 20, 2007, the special was released on DVD. The DVD, re-edited by Thomas himself, was twice as long as the broadcast and featured several classic McKenzie sketches from SCTV in their entirety, new footage filmed on the Great White North set and an hour&#x27;s worth of bonus features. A Bob and Doug McKenzie bottle opener was included with every DVD.

In 2007, on Rush&#x27;s Snakes &amp; Arrows Tour, a short film of Bob and Doug McKenzie was shown as an intro to the song &quot;The Larger Bowl&quot;.

Animax Entertainment, whose interactive division is currently headed by Dave Thomas, began producing a new animated series for the Global Television Network based on the characters debuting on April 19, 2009, simply entitled &quot;Bob &amp; Doug&quot;. Thomas reprised the character of Doug in the new series. Moranis chose not to voice the character of Bob. The part was instead voiced by Dave Coulier. Moranis was, however, involved in the series as an executive producer. The show aired 15 episodes.

They returned to the Great White North at a charity event held in Toronto in 2017 to help raise money for patients with spinal cord injuries. Jake Thomas, son of musician Ian Thomas and Dave&#x27;s nephew had been in a snowmobile accident that paralyzed him from the waist down. Raising money for the family was reason enough to convince Moranis, known for keeping a low profile, to reprise his role as Bob for the first time in 10 years. With celebrity friends such as Dan Aykroyd, Martin Short, Eugene Levy and Catherine O&#x27;Hara performing skits, the gig was sold out. Over $325,000 was raised and will go towards the Jake Thomas&#x27;s Road to Recovery GoFundMe campaign and the Spinal Cord Injury Ontario, in order to help others who have sustained spinal cord injuries.

The SYFY network show &quot;Z-Nation&quot; Season 4, Episode 8 - &#x27;Crisis of Faith&#x27;, featured the main characters entering Canada, and running into RCMP officers, a Hockey team bearing the Canada logo and of course, zombies very reminiscent of Bob &amp; Doug McKenzie. The cast members who confront the look-alikes used the GWN catch phrases &quot;eh&quot;, and &quot;hoser&quot; among others.

On March 24, 2020, a statue of Bob and Doug McKenzie was erected in Edmonton, Alberta, where the SCTV series was taped during most of the early 1980s. It depicts Bob and Doug enjoying a beer on a bench, and is near the Rogers Place arena. The statue was the result of a collaboration between local sculptor Ritchie Velthuis, the non-profit SCTV Monument Committee, and Calgary&#x27;s Bronzart Casting. Actors Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas provided input throughout the process.

Astronauts Robert L. Behnken and Douglas Hurley are likened to the McKenzies because of their friendship when they participated in the first commercial astronaut launch on 30 May 2020, SpaceX Crew Dragon Demo-2.

==Opinions of the creators==
In Dave Thomas&#x27;s behind-the-scenes book on &quot;SCTV&quot;, he reports that he and Moranis disliked the characters because they felt the network forced the characters on them and that they, as actors, were overly identified with the dimwitted, beer-drinking duo. However, in an interview accompanying the &quot;Two-Four Anniversary&quot; premiere, Thomas credited the McKenzie Brothers as a successful comedic creation of which he was quite proud.

<doc id="670386" wikidata="Q567072" url="?curid=670386" title="Bull Durham">
<text>Bull Durham is a 1988 American romantic comedy sports film directed by Ron Shelton. The film stars Kevin Costner as &quot;Crash&quot; Davis, a veteran catcher from the AAA Richmond Braves, brought in to teach rookie pitcher Ebby Calvin &quot;Nuke&quot; LaLoosh (Tim Robbins) about the game in preparation for reaching the major leagues. Baseball groupie Annie Savoy (Susan Sarandon) romances Nuke, but finds herself increasingly attracted to Crash. Also featured are Robert Wuhl and Trey Wilson, as well as &quot;The Clown Prince of Baseball&quot;, Max Patkin. The film is partly based upon Shelton&#x27;s experience in minor league baseball, and depicts the players and fans of the Durham Bulls, a minor-league baseball team in Durham, North Carolina.

&quot;Bull Durham&quot; was a commercial success, grossing over $50 million in North America, well above its estimated budget, and was a critical success as well. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; ranked it the #1 Greatest Sports Movie of all time. &quot;The Moving Arts Film Journal&quot; ranked it #3 on its list of the 25 Greatest Sports Movies of All-Time. In addition, the film is ranked #55 on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Funniest Movies.&quot; It is also ranked #97 on the American Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;100 Years...100 Laughs&quot; list, and #1 on Rotten Tomatoes&#x27; list of the 53 best-reviewed sports movies.

==Plot==
The Durham Bulls, a single-A Minor League Baseball team, are dealing with another sparsely attended losing season, with one thing working for them: Ebby Calvin LaLoosh, a hotshot rookie pitcher known for having a &quot;million dollar arm, but a five cent head,&quot; who has potential to become a major league talent. &quot;Crash&quot; Davis, a 12-year veteran in the minor leagues, is sent down from Triple-A as the team&#x27;s catcher to teach LaLoosh to control his haphazard pitching. Crash immediately begins calling Ebby by the degrading nickname of &quot;Meat&quot;, and they get off to a rocky start.

Thrown into the mix is Annie, a &quot;baseball groupie&quot; and lifelong spiritual seeker who has latched onto the &quot;Church of Baseball&quot; and has, every year, chosen one player on the Bulls to be her lover and student. Annie flirts with both Crash and Ebby and invites them to her house, but Crash walks out, saying he&#x27;s too much of a veteran to &quot;try out&quot; for anything. But before he leaves, Crash sparks Annie&#x27;s interest with a memorable speech listing the things he &quot;believes in&quot;, ending with, &quot;I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last three days... Good night&quot;.

Despite some animosity between them, Annie and Crash work, in their own ways, to shape Ebby into a big-league pitcher. Annie plays mild bondage games, reads poetry to him, gets him to try different mental approaches to pitching, and gives him the nickname &quot;Nuke&quot;.

Crash forces Nuke to learn &quot;not to think&quot; by letting the catcher make the pitching calls. After Nuke shakes off his signs, he twice tells the batters what pitch is coming, leading to both players hitting home runs; he also lectures him about the pressure of facing major league hitters who can hit his &quot;heat&quot; (fastballs). Crash talks about life in the major leagues, which he lived for &quot;the 21 greatest days of my life&quot; and to which he has tried for years to return. Meanwhile, as Nuke matures, the relationship between Annie and Crash grows, until it becomes obvious that the two of them are a more appropriate match.

After a rough start, Nuke becomes a dominant pitcher by mid-season, adding to the Bulls&#x27; good fortunes; in the end, he is called up to the major leagues. This incites jealous anger in Crash, who is frustrated by Nuke&#x27;s failure to value the rare talent he has. Nuke leaves, Annie ends their relationship, and Crash overcomes his jealousy enough to leave Nuke with some final words of advice.

The Bulls, now having no use for Nuke&#x27;s mentor, call up a younger catcher and release Crash. Crash presents himself at Annie&#x27;s house and the two consummate their attraction with a weekend-long lovemaking session. Crash then leaves Annie&#x27;s house to seek a further minor-league position.

Nuke is seen one last time, being interviewed by the press as a major leaguer, reciting the clichéd answers that Crash had taught him earlier. Crash joins another team, the Asheville Tourists, and breaks the minor-league record for career home runs. He then retires as a player and returns to Durham, where Annie tells him she&#x27;s ready to give up her annual affairs with &quot;boys.&quot; Crash tells her that he is thinking about becoming a manager for a minor-league team in Visalia. The film ends with Annie and Crash dancing in Annie&#x27;s candle-lit living room.

==Cast==
==Background==
The film&#x27;s name is based on the nickname for Durham, North Carolina, since 1874, when W. T. Blackwell and Company named its product &quot;Bull&quot; Durham tobacco, which soon became a well-known trademark. In 1898, James B. Duke purchased the company and renamed it the American Tobacco Company. By this time, the nickname &quot;Bull City&quot; had already stuck.

The film&#x27;s writer and director, Ron Shelton, played minor league baseball for five years after graduating from Westmont College in Santa Barbara, California. Initially playing second base for the Baltimore Orioles&#x27; farm system, he moved from the Appalachian League to California and then Texas before finally playing AAA baseball for the Rochester Red Wings in the International League. Shelton quit when he realized he would never become a major league player. &quot;I was 25. In baseball, you feel 60 if you&#x27;re not in the big leagues. I didn&#x27;t want to become a Crash Davis&quot;, he said.

He returned to school and earned a Master of Fine Arts in sculpture at the University of Arizona before moving to Los Angeles to join the city&#x27;s art scene. However, he felt more kinship in telling stories than in creating performance art. His break into filmmaking came with scriptwriting credits on the films &quot;Under Fire&quot; and &quot;The Best of Times&quot;.

According to Justin Turner, the bull in right field that was hit for a home run in the film is actually in left field at Durham Bulls Athletic Park.

== Production ==
According to Shelton, &quot;I wrote a very early script about minor league baseball; the only thing it had in common with &quot;Bull Durham&quot; was that it was about a pitcher and a catcher.&quot; That script was titled &quot;The Player To Be Named Later&quot;; a single anecdote from that script made it into &quot;Bull Durham&quot;. For &quot;Bull Durham&quot;, Shelton &quot;decided to see if a woman could tell the story&quot; and &quot;dictated that opening monologue on a little micro-recorder while I was driving around North Carolina.&quot; Crash was named after Lawrence &quot;Crash&quot; Davis but was modeled after Pike Bishop, the lead character William Holden played in &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;: a guy who &quot;loved something more than it loved him.&quot; Annie Savoy&#x27;s name was a combination of the nickname (&quot;Annies&quot;) that baseball players gave their groupies and the name of a bar; she was a &quot;High Priestess [who] could lead us into a man&#x27;s world, and shine a light on it. And she would be very sensual, and sexual, yet she&#x27;d live by her own rigorous moral code. It seemed like a character we hadn&#x27;t seen before.&quot; After Shelton returned to Los Angeles from his road trip, he wrote the script for &quot;Bull Durham&quot; in &quot;about twelve weeks.&quot;

Filming began on October 5, 1987, and wrapped on November 30, 1987, after 56 days of filming. When Shelton pitched &quot;Bull Durham&quot;, he had a hard time convincing a studio to give him the opportunity to direct. Baseball movies were not considered a viable commercial prospect at the time and every studio passed except for Orion Pictures who gave him a $9 million budget (with many cast members accepting lower-than-usual salaries because of the material), an eight-week shooting schedule, and creative freedom. Shelton scouted locations throughout the southern United States before settling on Durham in North Carolina because of its old ballpark and its location, &quot;among abandoned tobacco warehouses and on the edge of an abandoned downtown and in the middle of a residential neighborhood where people could walk&quot;. According to &quot;NO BULL: The Real Story of the Rebirth of a Team and a City&quot; by Ron Morris, Shelton decided because the city was &quot;run down with vacated tobacco warehouses and boarded up downtown storefronts&quot; it made a &quot;down-and-out, minor-league town that represented his story well.&quot; The Imperial Tobacco Warehouse, which is currently owned and has been renovated by Measurement Incorporated, was used as a filming location. The Queen Anne style James Manning House, built in 1880, was used for Annie Savoy&#x27;s romantic encounters.

Shelton cast Costner because of the actor&#x27;s natural athleticism. Costner was a former high school baseball player and was able to hit two home runs while the cameras were rolling and, according to Shelton, insisted &quot;on throwing runners out even when they (the cameras) weren&#x27;t rolling&quot;. He cast Robbins over the strong objections of the studio, who wanted Anthony Michael Hall instead. Shelton had to threaten to quit before the studio backed off.

Producer Thom Mount (who is part-owner of the real Durham Bulls) hired Pete Bock, a former semi-pro baseball player, as a consultant on the film. Bock recruited more than a dozen minor-league players, ran a tryout camp to recruit an additional 40 to 50 players from lesser ranks, hired several minor-league umpires, and conducted two-a-day workouts and practice games with Tim Robbins pitching and Kevin Costner catching. Bock made sure the actors looked and acted like ballplayers and that the real players acted convincingly in front of the cameras. He said, &quot;The director would say, &#x27;This is the shot we want. What we need is the left fielder throwing a one-hopper to the plate. Then we need a good collision at the plate.&#x27; I would select the players I know could do the job, and then we would go out and get it done.&quot;

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Bull Durham&quot; debuted on June 15, 1988, and grossed $5 million in 1,238 theaters on its opening weekend. It went on to gross a total of $50.8 million in North America, well above its estimated $9 million budget.

===Critical response===

The film was well-received critically. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 97%, based on 72 reviews, with an average rating of 8.00/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Kevin Costner is at his funniest and most charismatic in &quot;Bull Durham&quot;, a film that&#x27;s as wise about relationships as it is about minor league baseball.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 73 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

According to a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; poll of 100 film critics, &quot;Bull Durham&quot; was the second most acclaimed film of 1988, second to only to the documentary &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot;.

In David Ansen&#x27;s review for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, he wrote that the film &quot;works equally as a love story, a baseball fable and a comedy, while ignoring the clichés of each genre&quot;. Vincent Canby praised Shelton&#x27;s direction in his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;He demonstrates the sort of expert comic timing and control that allow him to get in and out of situations so quickly that they&#x27;re over before one has time to question them. Part of the fun in watching &quot;Bull Durham&quot; is in the awareness that a clearly seen vision is being realized. This is one first-rate debut&quot;.

Roger Ebert praised Sarandon&#x27;s performance in his review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;: &quot;I don&#x27;t know who else they could have hired to play Annie Savoy, the Sarandon character who pledges her heart and her body to one player a season, but I doubt if the character would have worked without Sarandon&#x27;s wonderful performance&quot;. In his review for &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, Steve Wulf wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s a good movie and a damn good baseball movie&quot;. Hal Hinson, in his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, wrote, &quot;The people associated with &quot;Bull Durham&quot; know the game ... and the firsthand experience shows in their easy command of the ballplayer&#x27;s vernacular, in their feel for what goes through a batter&#x27;s head when he digs in at the plate and in their knowledge of the secret ceremonies that take place on the mound&quot;. Richard Corliss, in his review for &quot;Time&quot;, wrote, &quot;Costner&#x27;s surly sexiness finally pays off here; abrading against Sarandon&#x27;s earth-mama geniality and Robbins&#x27; rube egocentricity, Costner strikes sparks&quot;.

===Legacy===
&quot;Bull Durham&quot; was named Best Screenplay of 1988 by New York Film Critics&#x27; Circle. The film became a minor hit when released, and is now considered one of the best sports movies of all time. In 2003, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; ranked &quot;Bull Durham&quot; as the &quot;Greatest Sports Movie&quot;. In addition, the film is ranked number 55 on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Funniest Movies.&quot; It is also ranked #97 on the American Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;100 Years...100 Laughs&quot; list, and #1 on Rotten Tomatoes&#x27; Top Sports Movies list of the 53 best reviewed sports movies of all time. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked &quot;Bull Durham&quot; as the fifth best DVD of their Top 30 Sports Movies on DVD. The magazine also ranked the film as the fifth best sports film since 1983 in their &quot;Sports 25: The Best Thrill-of-Victory, Agony-of-Defeat Films Since 1983&quot; poll and #5 on their &quot;50 Sexiest Movies Ever&quot; poll. In June 2008, AFI revealed its &quot;Ten top Ten&quot;—the best ten films in ten &quot;classic&quot; American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. &quot;Bull Durham&quot; was acknowledged as the fifth best film in the sports genre. The real life Durham Bulls, playing in the single-A Carolina League at the time of the film&#x27;s release, would later see the team open a new ballpark (Durham Bulls Athletic Park) in 1995, and would be promoted to the triple-A International League in 1998.

In 2003, a 15th anniversary celebration of &quot;Bull Durham&quot; at the National Baseball Hall of Fame was canceled by Hall of Fame president Dale Petroskey. Petroskey, who was on the White House staff during the Reagan administration, told Robbins that the actor&#x27;s public opposition to the US-led war in Iraq helped to &quot;undermine the U.S. position, which could put our troops in even more danger.&quot; Costner, a self-described libertarian, defended Robbins and Sarandon, saying, &quot;I think Tim and Susan&#x27;s courage is the type of courage that makes our democracy work. Pulling back this invite is against the whole principle about what we fight for and profess to be about.&quot;

For years, Ron Shelton has contemplated making a sequel and remarked, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t figure out in the few years right after it came out, what do you do? Nuke&#x27;s in the big leagues, Crash is managing in Visalia. Is Annie going to go to Visalia? I&#x27;ve been to Visalia. That will test a relationship ... It was not a simple fable to continue with – not that we don&#x27;t talk about continuing it, now that everyone&#x27;s in their 60s&quot;.

Actor Trey Wilson, who played Durham manager Joe Riggins, died of a cerebral hemorrhage at age 40, seven months after this film&#x27;s release.

<text>Anastasia Andreyevna Myskina ( ; born 8 July 1981) is a Russian former professional tennis player. Myskina won the 2004 French Open singles title, becoming the first Russian woman to win a major singles title. Due to this victory, she rose to No. 3 in the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association (WTA) rankings, becoming the first Russian woman to reach the top 3 in the history of the rankings. In September 2004, she reached a career-high ranking of No. 2.

==Tennis career==
===1999–2001===
Myskina was born in Moscow and turned professional in 1998, the year in which she broke into the WTA top 500. She won her first WTA title in Palermo in only her second appearance in the main draw of a WTA Tour tournament. She made her debut in a Grand Slam tournament at the US Open and the Fed Cup (playing doubles). In 2000, Myskina scored first career top-20 victory over No. 17 Barbara Schett en route to the Sopot semifinal. She debuted at Roland Garros (which she would later win) and Wimbledon. She played in the Sydney Olympics and reached her first Tier I quarterfinal in Zürich, where she lost to world No. 1 Martina Hingis. Myskina was plagued by injury that forced her to miss the Australian Open. As a result, she fell out of the top 100. She then had a solid indoor performance, reaching the quarterfinals in Leipzig and the semifinals in Moscow, her first career Tier I semifinal.

===2002===
2002 was a breakthrough season for Myskina. She scored her first top-10 win over defending champion Jelena Dokić in Rome, and entered so the top 20. Myskina reached back-to-back grass-court finals in Birmingham and Eastbourne, and rose to No. 15 in the rankings. She won her first Tier II Brasil Open title in Salvador, Bahia, and another runner-up finish in Leipzig confirmed her spot in WTA Tour Championships. She finished the 2002 season in the top 15 for the first time in her career.

===2003===
Myskina obtained an invite to play the Hong Kong Ladies Challenge and reached the Australian Open quarterfinals (her first Grand Slam quarterfinal appearance of six). After claiming the title in Doha and defeating friend Elena Likhovtseva in the first all-Russian final in WTA history, she cracked the top 10. Established her place among the game elite with a win in Sarasota, Myskina also had mediocre results during the summer season were followed by a quarterfinal appearance at the US Open, back-to-back titles in Leipzig (defeating No. 1 Kim Clijsters and No. 2 Justine Henin) and Moscow, which was her first Tier I title. She became the first Russian woman to win the Kremlin Cup), and she made the finals in Philadelphia. Myskina qualified for the Tour Championships. She earned more than US$ one million in prize money, and finished the year in the top 10 for the first time in her career.

===2004: French Open champion===
2004 was Myskina&#x27;s best season. Myskina successfully defended her Doha title, afterwards becoming the second Russian woman to break into the top 5, the first was Natasha Zvereva, who rose to No. 5 in the world in May 1989. The highlight of Myskina&#x27;s 2004 season was a victory at the French Open, where she saved match points in the fourth round against Svetlana Kuznetsova, then defeated former world No. 1 players Venus Williams and Jennifer Capriati, en route to a 6–1, 6–2 victory over compatriot Elena Dementieva in the first all-Russian Grand Slam final, thus making her the first female Russian to win a Grand Slam singles title. Prior to her French Open victory, she had never made it past the second round at Roland Garros. Following her win in Paris, she rose to No. 3 in the rankings. She reached the final in San Diego, breaking Maria Sharapova&#x27;s 14-match winning streak that included Wimbledon and beat Vera Zvonareva 17–15 in a third set tie-break, saving nine match points, winning the longest final set tie-break in WTA Tour history. She lost in the 2004 Athens Olympics semifinal to Justine Henin, having led 5–1 in the final set. She rose to a career-high No. 2 in the rankings. Myskina recovered from the tough loss to win the Kremlin Cup for the second straight year, and beat No. 2 Lindsay Davenport for the first time in five meetings &quot;en route&quot; to doing so. She finished on the top of her group at the WTA Championships, and scored her second win over a world No. 1 by again beating Davenport, but lost in the semifinals to the eventual champion Sharapova. Myskina led Russia to its first Fed Cup title, winning eight out of nine matches played, including winning all of her three matches in the final. Finished the season as world No. 3, a career-best year-end rank for a female Russian, and won over US$2 million in prize money, having scored ten top-10-wins during the 2004 season.

===2005===

2005 brought Myskina mixed fortunes. She spent the first half of 2005 poorly, due to personal issues regarding her mother&#x27;s health. Myskina surrendered her Doha and Roland Garros titles in the very first round, and became the first Roland Garros champion to lose in the opening round. Bringing an 8–10 win–loss record to the beginning of the grass court season, Myskina managed to turn it around at Wimbledon by reaching her career-first quarterfinal at the event with three comeback wins over Jelena Janković (from a 1–5 final set deficit), and over Dementieva (being 1–6, 0–3 down and facing match points in the second set tiebreak). She fell out of the top 10 in August. She then won her tenth career title in Kolkata beating lower-ranked opponents. She also beat the Wimbledon champion Venus Williams in Fed Cup semifinals, but then lost both of her matches in the final. Myskina finished inside top 15 for the fourth straight time.

===2006===
2006 was another disappointing season for Myskina. Having had several chances to return to the top 10, she failed to convert any of them. In Warsaw, she suffered her worst defeat in terms of the rankings on WTA Tour level, falling to a wildcard, Agnieszka Radwańska, then ranked No. 309. At Roland Garros, Myskina defeated 2005 quarterfinalist Ana Ivanovic in the third round before losing to the eventual champion Justine Henin in the fourth round.

She showed splashes of her old form during the grass season, having reached the Eastbourne final beautifully, losing to Justine Henin-Hardenne in a close final concluded in a third set tiebreak. She made the Wimbledon quarterfinals, but lost to eventual champion Amélie Mauresmo in three sets. She had solid performance at the first two majors, making the fourth round on each occasion. After Wimbledon, her game completely fell apart. Along with second straight runner-up finish at the Tier IV event in Stockholm, she did not manage to win a single match in North America, going 0–3 during the US Open Series. The downfall reached its nadir when she became the first person to lose a Grand Slam match against future world No. 1, Victoria Azarenka, at the US Open, having entered the event under an injury cloud carried over from New Haven. Anastasia sat out for a majority of the indoor season with a foot and toe injury, pulling out of Stuttgart and her home tournament in Moscow. She returned to play in Zürich, but lost to then unknown Swiss qualifier Timea Bacsinszky, 3–6, 3–6.

===2007: Struggles with injuries, final year===
Myskina only played two singles matches, having been injured. She lost both of those matches; including to Meghann Shaughnessy at the French Open, only winning one game.

==Playing style==
Myskina was a baseline player who combined excellent defensive skills with aggressive shot-making abilities. Her two-handed backhand was powerful, and was hit flat and with consistent depth, and was responsible for many of the winners she accumulated on court. Her forehand was also strong, especially when hit inside-out, and could be devastating when Myskina was in good form, but a lack of control sometimes led to a high number of unforced errors when employing this shot. Her serve was reliable, although not particularly strong, with her average first serve being delivered at , meaning that she did not ace frequently, although her serve speed had been recorded as fast as . Her second serve was weaker, typically being delivered at , and was susceptible to attack by aggressive players. When Myskina was nervous, her second serve became less reliable, leading to a relatively high double fault count. Myskina&#x27;s greatest strengths as a player were her exceptional speed and court coverage, detailed and precise footwork, anticipation, and ability to improvise as and when the situation required. She also possessed delicate touch, and was able to incorporate drop shots and lobs effectively into points, and frequently hit winners with these typically defensive shots. Due to her doubles experience, she was also an adept volleyer when she chose to approach the net. Myskina&#x27;s greatest weakness was her inconsistency, which was exacerbated by her fiery temper that was described as &quot;volcanic&quot; by some commentators.

==Endorsements and apparel==
Myskina was endorsed by Nike for clothing and apparel, and Head for rackets.

==Personal life==
Myskina dated HC Dynamo Moscow hockey player Aleksandr Stepanov.

In October 2002, she had a series of photos taken for &quot;GQ&quot; magazine by the photographer Mark Seliger for a spread in the October 2002 edition of &quot;GQ&quot;, in which one approved photo of her fully clothed was published. After she won the French Open in 2004, some photographs from the shoot, in which she appeared topless, were published in the Russian magazine &quot;Medved&quot; (&quot;Bear&quot;).

In August 2004, she filed a US$8 million lawsuit against &quot;GQ&quot; for allowing her topless photographs to appear in &quot;Medved&quot; without her consent. On 19 June 2005, U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey, later United States Attorney General, ruled Myskina could not stop the distribution of the topless photos, because she had signed a release. She had claimed that she did not understand the photo release form and that she was not fluent in English at the time.

Myskina has three sons, born in 2008, 2010, and 2012.

When she was interviewed about parenting with Tennis.com she said: &quot;Being a mother is so different; it’s not that it’s quieter or faster, it’s just different. Being a mom is tough. You understand what’s good for you and the babies, while tennis is just a game. It’s fun because you have a different life when you step on the court but when the baby is sick you go crazy. When I lost a match it was really bad time, now I know it was a great time, so being a mom is tougher.&quot; She also made a lot of statements about tennis more benefiting girls than boys: &quot;I think this is absolutely not a male sport. I don&#x27;t want to offend any male tennis player, but ... our game is not a team game, a sport for egoists. And if women somehow cope, then men – they are so weak. I am for team sports! Friendship, mutual assistance is the best that the team can give.&quot;

<doc id="670395" wikidata="Q7737995" url="?curid=670395" title="The Great White North (album)">
<text>The Great White North is a Canadian comedy album by the fictional television characters Bob and Doug McKenzie (portrayed by actors Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas), released in 1981 by Anthem Records (ANR-1-1036) and distributed in the United States by Mercury Records (SRM-1-4034). The title is a nickname for Canada, also used as the title of a &quot;Second City Television&quot; (SCTV) sketch featuring Bob and Doug. This album&#x27;s release tied in with &quot;SCTV&quot; at the height of the characters&#x27; popularity, and a still from the show is on its cover. In its sleeve is a newspaper parody called &quot;The Daily Hoser&quot;.

The complete story of how Anthem Records&#x27; Perry Goldberg fought to get the &quot;Great White North&quot; album made is at Billboard Canada: https://ca.billboard.com/fyi/how-gut-feeling-made-million-bob-doug-mckenzie

==Sales==
At least one million copies of the album were sold in North America, 350,000 of these in Canada alone; this earned a triple-platinum certification from the Canadian Recording Industry Association for the album.

&quot;The Great White North&quot; entered the &quot;RPM&quot; Canadian album charts at #3 on 12 December 1981 and rose to the #1 position the following week where it remained until 23 January 1982. Overall, &quot;RPM&quot; ranked the album #40 of albums released in Canada during 1981. It peaked at number 8 on the American &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart in 1982.

==&quot;Take Off&quot;==
The song &quot;Take Off&quot; (identified on the album as &quot;the hit single section&quot;), features guest vocalist Geddy Lee of Rush, an elementary schoolmate of Moranis. In it he utters the line, “Yeah, um, I, you know, ten bucks is ten bucks”, after a reminder of his deal with the brothers&#x27; lawyer. It was a hit, peaking at number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 100 singles chart in March 1982, five spots higher than Rush&#x27;s most popular U.S. song, &quot;New World Man&quot;, released a year later. It reached #14 on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; chart and #5 on WLS-AM in Chicago. On Canada&#x27;s CHUM Charts it was No. 1 for 2 weeks.

==Awards==
In 1982, this album received the Juno Award for Comedy Album of the Year.

In 1983, it was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album, but lost to &quot;Richard Pryor: Live on the Sunset Strip&quot;.

Side 2 of the original vinyl album also includes a very brief unlabeled track of Bob McKenzie (Moranis) saying the two words &quot;black hole&quot; and then laughing just before the &quot;You Are Our Guest&quot; segment. This is a callback to the fourth track on side 2 called &quot;Black Holes&quot;, in which Bob insists the spaces between tracks of a vinyl album are black holes.

==Reviews==
Liam Lacey&#x27;s review of the album in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; concluded on a negative sentiment, noting the production was &quot;entertaining listening - about twice. Other hosers are going to find it extremely confusing.&quot;

==In popular culture==
Track #7, &quot;Take Off&quot; is featured in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; Season 13 episode, &quot;The Bart Wants What It Wants&quot;.

&quot;Take Off&quot; is also featured in &quot;Ash vs. Evil Dead&quot; Season 2 episode, &quot;DUI&quot;.

Featured among other classic artists, track #15, &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas&quot; also appears on a compilation album entitled, &quot;A Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Christmas II&quot;.

<text>In statistics, ancillarity is a property of a statistic computed on a sample dataset in relation to a parametric model of the dataset. An ancillary statistic has the same distribution regardless of the value of the parameters and thus provides no information about them.
It is opposed to the concept of a complete statistic which contains no ancillary information. It is closely related to the concept of a sufficient statistic which contains all of the information that the dataset provides about the parameters.

A ancillary statistic is a specific case of a pivotal quantity that is computed only from the data and not from the parameters. They can be used to construct prediction intervals. They are also used in connection with Basu&#x27;s theorem to prove independence between statistics.

This concept was first introduced by Ronald Fisher in the 1920s, but its formal definition was only provided in 1964 by Debabrata Basu.

==Examples==

Suppose &quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; are independent and identically distributed, and are normally distributed with unknown expected value &quot;μ&quot; and known variance 1. Let

:formula_1

be the sample mean.

The following statistical measures of dispersion of the sample
*Range: max(&quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;) − min(&quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;Xn&quot;)
*Interquartile range: &quot;Q&quot;3 − &quot;Q&quot;1
*Sample variance:
:: formula_2
are all &quot;ancillary statistics&quot;, because their sampling distributions do not change as &quot;μ&quot; changes. Computationally, this is because in the formulas, the &quot;μ&quot; terms cancel – adding a constant number to a distribution (and all samples) changes its sample maximum and minimum by the same amount, so it does not change their difference, and likewise for others: these measures of dispersion do not depend on location.

Conversely, given i.i.d. normal variables with known mean 1 and unknown variance &quot;σ&quot;2, the sample mean formula_3 is &quot;not&quot; an ancillary statistic of the variance, as the sampling distribution of the sample mean is &quot;N&quot;(1, &quot;σ&quot;2/&quot;n&quot;), which does depend on &quot;σ&quot; 2 – this measure of location (specifically, its standard error) depends on dispersion.

=== In location-scale families ===
In a location family of distributions, formula_4 is an ancillary statistic.

In a scale family of distributions, formula_5 is an ancillary statistic.

In a location-scale family of distributions, formula_6, where formula_7 is the sample variance, is an ancillary statistic.

== In recovery of information ==
It turns out that, if formula_8 is a non-sufficient statistic and formula_9 is ancillary, one can sometimes recover all the information about the unknown parameter contained in the entire data by reporting formula_8 while conditioning on the observed value of formula_9. This is known as &quot;conditional inference&quot;.

For example, suppose that formula_12 follow the formula_13 distribution where formula_14 is unknown. Note that, even though formula_15 is not sufficient for formula_14 (since its Fisher information is 1, whereas the Fisher information of the complete statistic formula_3 is 2), by additionally reporting the ancillary statistic formula_18, one obtains a joint distribution with Fisher information 2.

==Ancillary complement==
Given a statistic &quot;T&quot; that is not sufficient, an ancillary complement is a statistic &quot;U&quot; that is ancillary and such that (&quot;T&quot;, &quot;U&quot;) is sufficient. Intuitively, an ancillary complement &quot;adds the missing information&quot; (without duplicating any).

The statistic is particularly useful if one takes &quot;T&quot; to be a maximum likelihood estimator, which in general will not be sufficient; then one can ask for an ancillary complement. In this case, Fisher argues that one must condition on an ancillary complement to determine information content: one should consider the Fisher information content of &quot;T&quot; to not be the marginal of &quot;T&quot;, but the conditional distribution of &quot;T&quot;, given &quot;U&quot;: how much information does &quot;T&quot; &quot;add&quot;? This is not possible in general, as no ancillary complement need exist, and if one exists, it need not be unique, nor does a maximum ancillary complement exist.

===Example===
In baseball, suppose a scout observes a batter in &quot;N&quot; at-bats. Suppose (unrealistically) that the number &quot;N&quot; is chosen by some random process that is independent of the batter&#x27;s ability – say a coin is tossed after each at-bat and the result determines whether the scout will stay to watch the batter&#x27;s next at-bat. The eventual data are the number &quot;N&quot; of at-bats and the number &quot;X&quot; of hits: the data (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;N&quot;) are a sufficient statistic. The observed batting average &quot;X&quot;/&quot;N&quot; fails to convey all of the information available in the data because it fails to report the number &quot;N&quot; of at-bats (e.g., a batting average of 0.400, which is very high, based on only five at-bats does not inspire anywhere near as much confidence in the player&#x27;s ability than a 0.400 average based on 100 at-bats). The number &quot;N&quot; of at-bats is an ancillary statistic because
* It is a part of the observable data (it is a &quot;statistic&quot;), and
* Its probability distribution does not depend on the batter&#x27;s ability, since it was chosen by a random process independent of the batter&#x27;s ability.
This ancillary statistic is an ancillary complement to the observed batting average &quot;X&quot;/&quot;N&quot;, i.e., the batting average &quot;X&quot;/&quot;N&quot; is not a sufficient statistic, in that it conveys less than all of the relevant information in the data, but conjoined with &quot;N&quot;, it becomes sufficient.

<text>The Multimedia PC (MPC) is a recommended configuration for a personal computer (PC) with a CD-ROM drive. The standard was set and named by the Multimedia PC Marketing Council, which was a working group of the Software Publishers Association (SPA, now the Software and Information Industry Association). The MPMC comprised companies including Microsoft, Creative Labs, Dell, Gateway, and Fujitsu. Any PC with the required standards could be called an &quot;MPC&quot; by licensing the use of the logo from the SPA.

==Background and reception==
CD-ROM drives were just coming to market in 1990, and it was difficult to concisely communicate to a consumer all the hardware requirements for using &quot;multimedia software&quot;, which mostly meant &quot;displaying video synced with audio on a PC via a CD-ROM drive&quot;. The MPC standard was supposed to communicate this concisely, so a consumer buying hardware or software could simply look for the MPC logo and be assured of compatibility.

The MPC program had mixed results primarily because of the vast number of PCs sold under different brands, and once Windows became ubiquitous on PCs, specifying minimum or recommended Windows versions and features was often clearer to consumers than the MPC nomenclature. As the standardized term failed to catch on, and as the Software Publishers Association turned away from consumer software in the late 1990s, interest in the MPC standard vanished. The problem of software labeling continues, especially in the field of computer games, where a multitude of 3D video cards has been manufactured with an extremely wide range of capabilities, and no common industry labeling standard to let consumers know whether their card is powerful enough to run a particular game.

No further specification beyond MPC Level 3 in 1996 was published; the Multimedia PC Marketing Council dissolved not too long afterward.

==Levels==
=== MPC Level 1 ===
The first MPC minimum standard, set in 1991, was:
* 16 MHz 386SX CPU

* 1× (single speed) CD-ROM drive using no more than 40% of CPU to read, with &lt; 1 second seek time
* Sound card (Creative Sound Blaster recommended as closest available to standard at the time) outputting 22 kHz, 8-bit sound; and inputting 11 kHz, 8-bit sound
* Windows 3.0 with Multimedia Extensions.

=== MPC Level 2 ===
In 1993, an MPC Level 2 minimum standard was announced:
* 25 MHz 486SX CPU
* 4 MB RAM
* 160 MB hard disk
* 16-bit color, 640×480 VGA video card

<text>IO Interactive A/S (IOI) is a Danish video game developer based in Copenhagen, best known for creating and developing the &quot;Hitman&quot; and &quot;Kane and Lynch&quot; franchises. IO Interactive&#x27;s most recent game is &quot;Hitman 3&quot;, which was released in January 2021.

The company was founded in September 1998 as a joint venture between the seven-man development team of Reto-Moto and film studio Nordisk Film. IO Interactive was acquired by publisher Eidos Interactive for in March 2004, which saw itself acquired by Square Enix and renamed as Square Enix Europe in 2009. In May 2017, Square Enix ceased funding for IO Interactive and started seeking a buyer for the studio. IO Interactive performed a management buyout in June 2017, becoming independent and regaining the rights to their &quot;Hitman&quot; and &quot;Freedom Fighters&quot; franchises. IO Interactive employs 200 people as of January 2021 and operates four subsidiary studios: IOI Malmö in Malmö, Sweden; IOI Barcelona in Barcelona, Spain, IOI Istanbul in Istanbul, Turkey, and IOI Brighton in Brighton, England.

== History ==

=== Background and foundation (1997–1998) ===

In 1997, Reto-Moto was founded as a video game developer in Copenhagen. Before the studio finished any games, they struck a partnership with Danish film studio Nordisk Film in 1998 that would lead to the creation of a developer jointly owned by the two companies. The resulting company, IO Interactive, was established on 16 September 1998, with Reto-Moto&#x27;s seven employees—Jesper Vorsholt Jørgensen, Rasmus Guldberg-Kjær, Martin Munk Pollas, Karsten Lemann Hvidberg, Jacob Andersen, Janos Flösser, and David Guldbrandsen—serving as the founders and initial staff of IO Interactive. Nordisk Film and the seven founders each held a 50% stake in the venture. By March 2004, Nordisk Film owned 40.3% in IO Interactive.

=== &quot;Hitman: Codename 47&quot; (1998–2000) ===
Early on, IO Interactive conceptualised a fantasy massively multiplayer online game (MMO) entitled &quot;Rex Dominus&quot;, however, Nordisk Film staff asked the development team to cease production on &quot;Rex Dominus&quot; and &quot;test [themselves]&quot; by developing a &quot;simple shooter&quot; instead. As such, the team opted for a run-and-gun action game, as it took less time to develop compared to an MMO, drawing inspiration from John Woo films, such as &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; and &quot;The Killer&quot;. They turned to develop for personal computers (PCs), because they were unable to acquire development kits for consoles, and had also found interest in the steady increase of PCs&#x27; 3D graphics capabilities.

A part of the development on the game, which would later become &quot;&quot;, was the creation of the Glacier, the studio&#x27;s proprietary game engine that fit their needs; co-founder Andersen stated: &quot;Since killing was the main theme of the game, we wanted to do something special. [...] Standard &#x27;death animations&#x27; just looked too static so some of the coders tried to see if they could use real-time inverse kinematics for the falling bodies. The first versions ran terribly slowly until one of the programmers figured out a way to fake the whole calculation.&quot; This led to the first use of advanced ragdoll physics in a video game. This physics system caught the eyes of British publisher Eidos Interactive, and especially staff member Jonas Eneroth, who thought that the system could greatly benefit &quot;Codename 47&quot; gameplay. Following six months of negotiations, a publishing deal was signed between IO Interactive and Eidos Interactive. Eneroth became executive producer on the project.

As executive producer, Eneroth encouraged the development team to stray away from the run-and-gun gameplay, and instead focus on a &quot;methodical experience&quot;, including dragging dead bodies around the scene to create tension. He had previously worked on &quot;Deus Ex&quot; and &quot;&quot;, which had heavily exposed him to the stealth game mechanics he wished to see in &quot;Codename 47&quot;. The game was released on 19 November 2000, with reception mixed due to the difficulty of the game.

=== Further ventures (2000–2004) ===
In October 2001, Eidos Interactive announced &quot;Hitman 2: Silent Assassin&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Codename 47&quot;. Following a slight delay in March 2002, it was released in October 2002, this time for Microsoft Windows, as well as PlayStation 2 and Xbox. To more easily overcome the challenge of bringing the game to consoles, IO Interactive grew &quot;considerably&quot; in headcount. The game was received well by critics; according to Greg Kasavin in his review for &quot;GameSpot&quot;, &quot;&quot;Hitman 2&quot; fixes virtually all of the problems of its predecessor&quot;. The success of &quot;Silent Assassin&quot; came as a surprise to the team, and was swiftly followed up with by porting the game to GameCube the following year.

In 2003, IO Interactive decided to open a Hungarian offshoot, named IO Interactive Hungary. To properly establish the studio, 50 Hungarian staff were hired and brought to the company&#x27;s Copenhagen headquarters for a six-month training programme. However, after the training had been finished, IO Interactive realised that there were 50 people with talent but no leadership that could guide them when in Hungary. Instead of fulfilling the Hungarian subsidiary, IO Interactive opted to offer all 50 people jobs at their headquarters, to which most of them agreed. In October that year, Electronic Arts released &quot;Freedom Fighters&quot;, an IO Interactive-developed third-person shooter which was previously announced as &quot;Freedom: The Battle for Liberty Island&quot; in May 2002. Although a sequel to &quot;Freedom Fighters&quot; has been anticipated, IO Interactive has been unable to comment on whether such a game was in development.

=== Acquisition by Eidos Interactive, further &quot;Hitman&quot; releases (2004–2006) ===
On 3 March 2004, Eidos Interactive announced that they were acquiring IO Interactive for in cash and stock, plus another linked to the studio&#x27;s performance in the following four years. The deal closed on 31 March that year. At the time, IO Interactive was Europe&#x27;s 10th largest video game developer, with 140 staff members employed at their offices. The sale was primarily negotiated by founding member Flösser.

The first game to release under Eidos Interactive&#x27;s management was &quot;&quot;, the third game in the &quot;Hitman&quot; franchise, which was announced and released in April that year. The game was developed in about nine months, from concept stage to console submission, but was under the influence of &quot;crunch time&quot; throughout the entire development. &quot;Contracts&quot; received positive reception. The next game, &quot;&quot;, was announced shortly afterwards, in November 2004. Released in May 2006, the game was praised by critics and retrospectively multiply referred to as the best game in the &quot;Hitman&quot; series.

=== Other games (2006–2010) ===
IO Interactive announced their next game, &quot;Kane &amp; Lynch: Dead Men&quot;, in August 2006. Unlike their &quot;Hitman&quot; games, &quot;Kane &amp; Lynch: Dead Men&quot; played as a linear, cooperative gameplay-focused third-person shooter, as opposed to &quot;Hitman&quot; sandbox solo stealth gameplay. Released in November 2007, the game gained mixed reviews, wherein some reviewers felt like the game had a disconnect with modern gameplay styles. On 11 April 2008, four of IO Interactive&#x27;s co-founders, Vorsholt Jørgensen, Pollas, Andersen and Guldbrandsen, announced that they had, together with former Eidos Interactive executive producer Neil Donnell, reformed Reto-Moto as an active developer. Guldbrandsen and Donnell became chief technology officer and chief executive officer, respectively. Six further IO Interactive employees followed to Reto-Moto in December that year. Co-founder and at the time managing director Flösser left the company in April 2008, and was succeeded by Niels Jørgensen, who had joined the company in 2002.

In January 2009, Eidos Interactive announced IO Interactive-developed &quot;Mini Ninjas&quot;, a family-friendly game, as opposed to all of the studio&#x27;s previous titles. Jørgensen explained that, using &quot;Mini Ninjas&quot;, the studio wanted to reach a broader demographic in the gaming market. Shortly after the announcement of &quot;Mini Ninjas&quot;, in April 2009, Eidos Interactive was acquired by Japanese video game conglomerate Square Enix for . Eidos Interactive was reorganised over the course of 2009 and became known as Square Enix Europe in November that year. Square Enix Europe continued to oversee their previously owned development studios, including IO Interactive. Speaking for IO Interactive, Karsten Lund stated that the studio experienced &quot;no loss of freedom&quot; following the buyout.

A sequel to &quot;Kane &amp; Lynch: Dead Men&quot;, titled &quot;Kane &amp; Lynch 2: Dog Days&quot;, was announced in November 2009, and released in August 2010. Critics found that most elements in the game had deliberately been made &quot;ugly&quot; to better fit into the well-told story of the game. In a November 2009 interview with gaming website &quot;Gamasutra&quot;, Jørgensen revealed that, due to the high costs associated with living in Scandinavia, much of the company&#x27;s graphic department had been outsourced to Shanghai. The Chinese office had been set up by two Danish representatives from IO Interactive, with one Dane permanently residing in Shanghai to look over the outsourcing progress. In March 2010, 35 of previously 200 employees were let go from the company. A further 30 people were laid off in November that year, supposedly due to the cancellation of a project that was in development for Microsoft.

=== Return to &quot;Hitman&quot; (2011–2016) ===
In May 2011, IO Interactive and Square Enix announced that they would be returning to the &quot;Hitman&quot; franchise through a new entry, &quot;&quot;. A spin-off demo, &quot;&quot;, was released in May 2012. &quot;Absolution&quot; was released in November that year, and, like &quot;Blood Money&quot;, saw highly positive reception from critics. However, many fans of the series, including the developers at IO Interactive, felt like &quot;Absolution&quot; was leaning too far into the mainstream, as a result of which they were losing their core player base. In February 2012, Square Enix opened a new Copenhagen office under the IO Interactive name. The following March, this new office was announced to be Hapti.co, a subsidiary studio focused on mobile games. Hapti.co was sold to Wargaming Mobile, the mobile games division of publisher Wargaming, in September 2017, and was renamed as Wargaming Copenhagen.

In June 2013, 70 staff members, half of IO Interactive&#x27;s workforce at the time, were made redundant due to &quot;internal adjustments to face the challenges of today&#x27;s market&quot;. Square Enix announced that, from that point on, IO Interactive would exclusively focus on the development of new entries in the &quot;Hitman&quot; franchise. At the same time, Hannes Seifert, who for the past three years had held the position of production director at IO Interactive, took over the company&#x27;s management as studio head. At a June 2015 press conference, Sony announced that a new game in the &quot;Hitman&quot; series, simply titled &quot;Hitman&quot;, had been slated for a December 2015 release. The game was shortly delayed to March 2016, and later announced to be released in an episodic model. As such, starting in March 2016, the first season for the game was released through six episodes, the last of which was released in October 2016. Around the same time, Ryan Barnard, previously director of the game &quot;The Division&quot;, left Massive Entertainment to join IO Interactive. At the time, IO Interactive had 170 employees, and was the largest video game developer in Denmark.

=== Management buyout, further &quot;Hitman&quot; games, &quot;Project 007&quot; (2017–present) ===
Seifert announced in February 2017 that he had left IO Interactive to return to his home country of Austria to pursue an unannounced project. Hakan B. Abrak, also formerly production director for the studio, took over his duties, becoming chief executive officer.

In May 2017, Square Enix announced that they had withdrawn funding from IO Interactive and would begin negotiating with potential investors that would want to purchase the studio. Several jobs were cut at IO Interactive shortly following that announcement. On 16 June 2017, IO Interactive announced that it had performed a management buyout, as a result of which they became independent. Square Enix retained a minor financial stake in IO Interactive. The buyout also included the intellectual property (IP) for &quot;Hitman&quot; and &quot;Freedom Fighters&quot;, but lacked that of &quot;Kane &amp; Lynch&quot; and &quot;Mini Ninjas&quot;. Yosuke Matsuda, president and chief executive officer of Square Enix at the time, stated that the company&#x27;s decision to divest itself of IO Interactive, alongside &quot;Hitman&quot;, was made because they felt like the series needed to go on, but would be in better hands with another partner or with IO Interactive itself. IO Interactive&#x27;s associate director, Eskil Mohl, said that, when Square Enix decided to withdraw from the studio, they were already working on &quot;Hitman 2&quot;, and the job cuts were a necessary step to make sure that the studio would remain viable without Square Enix&#x27;s backing; Mohl felt that this helped harden the studio to make &quot;Hitman 2&quot; a stronger game.

IO Interactive confirmed shortly after the split that all profits from 2016&#x27;s &quot;Hitman&quot; would from that point go directly to the studio. In August that year, the studio confirmed that another &quot;Hitman&quot; game was in development. In April 2018, IO Interactive partnered with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment (WBIE) to distribute a &quot;Definitive Edition&quot; of 2016&#x27;s &quot;Hitman&quot;, which was released in the following month. In June 2018, IO Interactive announced &quot;Hitman 2&quot;. Unlike 2016&#x27;s &quot;Hitman&quot;, &quot;Hitman 2&quot; does not feature an episodic release format. Published by WBIE, &quot;Hitman 2&quot; was released in November that year. On 16 January 2019, IO Interactive opened a subsidiary studio, IOI Malmö, in Malmö, Sweden. IO Interactive continued its partnership with WBIE and, by October 2019, had turned it into a multi-IP deal.

In June 2020, IO Interactive announced &quot;Hitman 3&quot;, the conclusion to their World of Assassination trilogy, which was released on 20 January 2021 for Windows computers and current and next-gen consoles, with IO publishing the game themselves.

In November 2020, the company announced &quot;Project 007&quot;, an original &quot;James Bond&quot; video game, working closely with licensors MGM and Eon Productions. IO studio director Hakan Abrak said they had spent about two years in preparing a pitch to the &quot;Bond&quot; license holders, knowing that the current rights holders, Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson were dissatisfied with the amount of violence in past &quot;Bond&quot; video games. IO&#x27;s Bond will be a wholly original character and not use any of the film actors&#x27; likenesses, and Abrak anticipates that this game would be the start of a trilogy of &quot;Bond&quot; games. Abrak expected that the game would require them to double their current staff of 200 employees to 400 by the time the first &quot;Bond&quot; game is released.

IOI Barcelona, based in Barcelona, Spain, was announced in April 2021. The studio is to assist IOI on its active projects, including &quot;Hitman&quot; and &quot;Project 007&quot; game.

In February 2023, IO Interactive announced &quot;Project Fantasy&quot;, this new IP is set to be an online fantasy RPG, a departure from IO&#x27;s &quot;Hitman&quot; games.

IOI Brighton, in Brighton, England, was announced by the company in July 2023. The studio initially will support IO&#x27;s &quot;Project 007&quot;, &quot;Project Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Hitman&quot;.

==== Partnership with Build A Rocket Boy ====
In 2024, IO Interactive introduced IOI Partners starting with the publication of MindsEye, a AAA title from Leslie Benzies&#x27;s Build A Rocket Boy. IOI is responsible for the game&#x27;s marketing and distribution and &quot;MindsEye&quot; serves as a demonstration of the Everywhere platform. Hakan Abrak, CEO of IO Interactive, mentioned that the game is well along in its development.

<text>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a 2007 fantasy film directed by David Yates from a screenplay by Michael Goldenberg. It is based on the 2003 novel &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; by J. K. Rowling. It is the sequel to &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; (2005) and the fifth instalment in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series. The film stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, alongside Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Harry&#x27;s best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger respectively. Its story follows Harry&#x27;s fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as the Ministry of Magic is in denial of Lord Voldemort&#x27;s return.

Filming took place in England and Scotland for exterior locations and Leavesden Film Studios in Watford for interior locations from February to November 2006, with a one-month break in June. Post-production on the film continued for several months afterwards to add in visual effects. The film&#x27;s budget was reportedly between £75 and 100 million ($150–200 million).

&quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; was released in 2D cinemas and IMAX formats in the United States on 11 July 2007 and in the United Kingdom on 12 July, by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and was nominated for many awards, including the BAFTA Award for Best Production Design and Special Visual Effects. With a worldwide five-day opening of $333 million and a total gross of $942 million, making it the second-highest-grossing film of 2007, the film was noted as a case of Hollywood accounting, as Warner Bros. claimed that it lost $167 million despite the total gross.

A sequel, &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;, was released in 2009.

==Plot==
While staying at the Dursleys&#x27;, Harry Potter and Dudley are attacked by Dementors. Harry repels them using a Patronus spell. The Ministry of Magic detects Harry using magic and expels him from Hogwarts, though he is later exonerated.

The Order of the Phoenix, a secret organisation founded by Albus Dumbledore, informs Harry that the Ministry of Magic is attempting to stonewall rumors about Lord Voldemort&#x27;s return. At the Order&#x27;s headquarters, Harry&#x27;s godfather, Sirius Black, mentions that Voldemort seeks an object he previously lacked; Harry believes it to be a weapon.

Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge has appointed Dolores Umbridge as Hogwarts new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. Umbridge&#x27;s refusal to teach defensive spells causes her and Harry to clash. Harry is forced to write lines for &quot;lying&quot; about Voldemort; a magic quill etches the words into his hand as he writes. Ron and Hermione are outraged, but Harry refuses to tell Dumbledore, who has distanced himself from Harry. As Umbridge gains more control over the school, Ron and Hermione help Harry form &quot;Dumbledore&#x27;s Army&quot;, a secret group to teach students defensive spells. Umbridge recruits Slytherins for an Inquisitorial Squad to spy on the other students. Meanwhile, Harry and Cho Chang develop romantic feelings for each other.

One night, Harry envisions Arthur Weasley being attacked at the Ministry, seeing it from the attacker&#x27;s perspective. Concerned that Voldemort will exploit this connection to Harry, Dumbledore has Severus Snape teach Harry Occlumency to defend his mind from Voldemort&#x27;s influence. During a lesson, Harry sees Snape&#x27;s memories of how his father, James, bullied and tormented Snape in school. The connection between Harry and Voldemort further isolates Harry from his friends. Meanwhile, Bellatrix Lestrange, Sirius&#x27;s deranged Death Eater cousin, escapes Azkaban prison along with nine other Death Eaters. At Hogwarts, Umbridge and her Inquisitorial Squad expose Dumbledore&#x27;s Army. Dumbledore, falsely accused of forming it, escapes as Fudge orders his arrest. Harry believes Cho betrayed Dumbledore&#x27;s Army to Umbridge, ending their budding relationship. Umbridge becomes the new Headmistress.

Harry experiences a vision that Voldemort is torturing Sirius. Harry, Ron, and Hermione rush to Umbridge&#x27;s office to alert the Order via the Floo Network. Umbridge catches them and, as she is about to severely punish Harry, Hermione claims Dumbledore has hidden a &quot;secret weapon&quot; in the Forbidden Forest. She and Harry lead Umbridge to where Hagrid&#x27;s giant half-brother, Grawp is kept. The centaurs confront them and kidnap Umbridge after she insults and attacks them. Harry, Hermione, Ron, Luna, Neville and Ginny fly to the Ministry of Magic on Thestrals to save Sirius.

The six enter the Department of Mysteries and recover the object that Voldemort is after, a bottled prophecy labelled with Harry&#x27;s name. Death Eaters ambush them, including Lucius Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange. Lucius reveals that Harry&#x27;s vision of Sirius being tortured was a ruse to lure him there. Harry refuses to give Lucius the prophecy, and a fight ensues. The Death Eaters overpower the students and force Harry to surrender the prophecy. When Harry hands it to Lucius, Sirius and Remus Lupin arrive with Order members, including Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley Shacklebolt and Mad-Eye Moody. Lucius accidentally drops the prophecy during the chaos, destroying it. Just as Sirius overpowers Lucius, Bellatrix kills Sirius.

Voldemort appears, but moments before he can kill Harry, Dumbledore arrives. A violent duel erupts, destroying much of the Atrium, while Bellatrix escapes. The two wizards are evenly matched, so Voldemort possesses Harry&#x27;s body, wanting Dumbledore to sacrifice him. The love Harry feels for his friends and family quickly drives out Voldemort. Ministry officials arrive before Voldemort disapparates; Fudge admits that Voldemort has returned and resigns in disgrace. Umbridge is dismissed and Dumbledore returns as Hogwarts headmaster. Dumbledore explains he had distanced himself from Harry to prevent Voldemort exploiting their connection. He also reveals the prophecy. As he grieves Sirius&#x27;s death, Harry tries to accept the prophecy: &quot;Neither can live while the other survives.&quot;

==Production==
===Development===
British television director David Yates was chosen to direct the film after &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; director Mike Newell, as well as Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Guillermo del Toro, Matthew Vaughn and Mira Nair, turned down offers. Yates believed he was approached because the studio saw him fit to handle an &quot;edgy and emotional&quot; film with a &quot;political backstory&quot;, which some of his previous television projects including &quot;State of Play&quot;, &quot;Sex Traffic&quot; and &quot;The Girl in the Café&quot; demonstrated. Producer David Heyman supported Yates&#x27;s comments about the film&#x27;s political theme, stating that &quot;[&quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;] is a political film, not with a capital P, but it&#x27;s about teen rebellion and the abuse of power. David has made films in the UK about politics without being heavy handed.&quot; On the film&#x27;s political and social aspects, Emma Watson stated that &quot;somehow it talks about life after 7 July, the way people behave when they&#x27;re scared, the way truth is often denied and all the things our society has to face. Facing the fact that the authority is corrupted means having a non-conformist approach to reality and power.&quot;

Steve Kloves, the screenwriter of the first four &quot;Potter&quot; films, had other commitments. Michael Goldenberg, who was considered to pen the first film in the series, filled in and wrote the script. Kloves subsequently returned to write all remaining instalments of the series.

Mark Day was the film editor, Sławomir Idziak was the cinematographer, and Jany Temime was the costume designer. Choreographer Paul Harris, who had previously worked with David Yates several times, created a physical language for wand combat to choreograph the wand fighting scenes.

===Casting===
Casting began as early as May 2005, when Radcliffe announced he would reprise his role as Harry. Across the media frenzy that took place during the release of &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;, most of the main returning actors announced their return to the series, including Grint, Watson, Lewis, Wright, Leung, and Fiennes.

The announcements of the casting of the rest of the new characters to the series was spanned across 2006. Evanna Lynch won the role of Luna Lovegood over 15,000 other girls who attended the open casting call, waiting in a line of hopefuls that stretched a mile long. Saoirse Ronan auditioned for the role but was considered too young.

Persistent rumours linked Elizabeth Hurley to the role of Bellatrix Lestrange, although Warner Bros. asserted there was &quot;no truth whatsoever&quot; to reports that she had been cast. As early as August 2005, rumours began linking Helen McCrory to the role. On 2 February 2006, it was announced that McCrory had indeed been cast as Bellatrix. However, in April 2006 she revealed that she was three months pregnant and withdrew from the film because she would not have been able to perform the intense battle sequences in the Ministry of Magic in September and October 2006. The announcement that Bonham Carter had been recast in the role was made on 25 May 2006. McCrory was subsequently cast as Narcissa Malfoy from &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot; onwards.

The inclusion or cutting of some characters sparked speculation from fans as to the importance of the characters in the final book of the series, which was released just ten days after the film. In April 2006, representatives of Jim McManus said he would be playing Aberforth Dumbledore, Albus&#x27;s brother and the barman of the Hog&#x27;s Head, in which Harry and his friends found Dumbledore&#x27;s Army. A week later WB announced that the role was &quot;very minor&quot;, allaying some of the speculation to the significance of the role, which, before the final book, was not even a speaking part. MTV reported in October 2006 that Dobby the house elf, who appeared in the second film, &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;, and in the fifth book, would be cut, opening up &quot;plot questions&quot; as to how the role of the elf would be filled. MTV also reported about a month before the release of the final book that Kreacher, the Black family&#x27;s house-elf, was cut from the film in one draft of the script. Rowling prodded the filmmakers to include him, saying, &quot;You know, I wouldn&#x27;t [cut him] if I were you. Or you can, but if you get to make a seventh film, you&#x27;ll be tied in knots&quot;, he was added back into the script.

Other minor roles were cut with subsequent drafts of the script. At the US premiere of &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;, series producer David Heyman said that former Hogwarts professor Gilderoy Lockhart, played by Kenneth Branagh in &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;, was in the first draft of the script for &quot;Phoenix&quot;. Neither Branagh nor the character of Lockhart appears in the final version. Tiana Benjamin was scheduled to return for the film in the role of Angelina Johnson, the captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, but she had to withdraw due to a commitment to playing Chelsea Fox in &quot;EastEnders&quot;. The character, as well as the entire Quidditch subplot, was ultimately cut from the film. Benjamin did record sound clips for the &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot; video game.

The family of footballer Theo Walcott made a cameo appearance in the film. They were signed on by director David Yates, who is the partner of Yvonne Walcott, Theo&#x27;s aunt. Theo himself was due to appear alongside his family, though his commitments to Arsenal Football Club forced him to pull out.

===Set design===
Stuart Craig returned as set designer, having designed the first four films&#x27; sets. There were a number of notable new sets in this film. The atrium in the Ministry of Magic is over 200 feet in length, making it the largest and most expensive set built for the &quot;Potter&quot; film series to date. Craig&#x27;s design was inspired by early London Underground stations, where, he said, architects &quot;tried to imitate classical architecture but they used ceramic tile&quot;, as well as a Burger King on Tottenham Court Road in London, where &quot;there&#x27;s a fantastic Victorian façade which just embodies the age&quot;. The set of Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place contains the Black family tapestry spread across three walls; when the producers told Rowling they wanted to visualise the details of each name and birth year, she faxed them a complete copy of the entire tree. The set of the Hall of Prophecies was entirely digitally built. During a fight scene which occurs there, prophecies crash to the ground and break; had it been an actual physical set, the reset time would have been weeks.

The set used for Igor Karkaroff&#x27;s trial scene in &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; was doubled in size for Harry&#x27;s trial in this film, while still protecting its symmetry. New professor Dolores Umbridge, though she teaches in a classroom that has appeared in films two through four, inhabits an office vastly different from those of her predecessors. The set was redressed with &quot;fluffy, pink filigree&quot; and a number of plates upon which moving kittens were animated in post-production. A 24-hour photo shoot was held to photograph and film the kittens for use on these plates. The quill which Umbridge gives Harry to write lines is designed by the set designers.

===Filming===

Rehearsals for &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot; began on 27 January 2006, and principal photography began on 7 February 2006 and wrapped in November 2006. Filming was put on a two-month hiatus starting in May 2006 so Radcliffe could sit his A/S Levels and Watson could sit her GCSE exams. The film&#x27;s budget was reportedly between £75 and 100 million (US$150–200 million). The largest budget of the other films in the series has been the £75 million it cost to make &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;. Though the producers explored options to film outside of the UK, Leavesden Film Studios in Watford was again the location on which many of the interior scenes, including the Great Hall, Privet Drive, and Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place were shot.

One of the locations in England is the River Thames, used for the flight of the Order of the Phoenix to Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place and the flight of Dumbledore&#x27;s Army to the Ministry of Magic. This sequence also includes such landmarks as the London Eye, Canary Wharf, Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, and . Filming at platform nine and three-quarters took place at King&#x27;s Cross station, as it has in the past. A red telephone booth near Scotland Yard was used as Harry and Arthur Weasley enter the Ministry, while the crew closed the Westminster tube station on 22 October 2006 to allow for filming of Arthur Weasley accompanying Harry to his trial at the Ministry of Magic. Other scenes were filmed in and around Oxford, specifically at nearby Blenheim Palace in Woodstock.

In Glenfinnan, the Hogwarts Express crosses a viaduct, as it has in the past films. Aerial scenes were shot in Glen Coe, Clachaig Gully, and Glen Etive, which, at the time of filming, was one of the few places in Scotland without snow, making it ideal for a backdrop.

Director David Yates stated in an interview that he had originally shot a three-hour cut of &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;. However, some material had to be cut out in the final edit, as the movie was 45 minutes too long. Therefore, several locations that were used for various scenes do not appear in the final cut of the film. In Virginia Water, scenes were shot where Professor McGonagall recovers from Stunning Spells, and Burnham Beeches was used for filming the scene where Hagrid introduces his fifth-year Care of magical creatures class to Thestrals. Harry skips stones in front of the Glenfinnan Monument in Glenfinnan in another cut scene.

===Visual effects===
The film required over 1,400 visual effects shots, and the London-based company Double Negative created more than 950 of them. Working for six months on previsualisation starting in September 2005, Double Negative was largely responsible for sequences in the Room of Requirement, the Forbidden Forest, the Hall of Prophecies, and the Death Chamber.

A new character in the film, Grawp, Hagrid&#x27;s giant half-brother, came to life by a new technology called Soul Capturing, developed by Image Metrics. Instead of building the character from scratch, the movements and facial expressions of actor Tony Maudsley were used to model Grawp&#x27;s actions.

===Music and soundtrack===

Nicholas Hooper was the composer for the soundtrack of the film, following John Williams, who scored the first three films, and Patrick Doyle, who did the fourth. In the new score, Hooper incorporated variations on &quot;Hedwig&#x27;s Theme&quot;, the series&#x27; theme originally written by Williams for the first film and heard in all subsequent instalments. In March and April 2007, Hooper and the Chamber Orchestra of London recorded nearly two hours of music at Abbey Road Studios in London. The score, like the film and book, is darker than previous instalments in the series. To emphasise this, the two new main themes reflect the sinister new character Dolores Umbridge, and Lord Voldemort&#x27;s invasion of Harry&#x27;s mind. A Japanese Taiko drum was used for a deeper sound in the percussion. The soundtrack was released by Warner Bros. Records on 10 July 2007, the eve of the film&#x27;s release. For his work on the film, Hooper was nominated for a World Soundtrack Discovery Award. The trailer prominently features the cues &quot;Divine Crusade&quot; by X-Ray Dog and &quot;DNA Reactor&quot; by Pfeifer Broz. Music.

The film also featured the song &quot;Boys Will Be Boys&quot; by The Ordinary Boys which played during a scene in the Gryffindor common room (at min. 31:35). According to Rupert Grint, David Yates used the song to create a more &quot;casual&quot; feel to the Common Room.

==Differences from the book==

At 766 pages in the British edition and 870 in the American edition, &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot; is the longest book in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, however the film is the second shortest. Screenwriter Michael Goldenberg described his task to cut down the novel as searching for &quot;the best equivalent way to tell the story. My job was to stay true to the spirit of the book, rather than to the letter&quot;. Goldenberg said that Rowling told him, the producers, and Yates that &quot;she just wanted to see a great movie, and gave [them] permission to take whatever liberties [they] felt [they] needed to take to translate the book into a movie she would love&quot;. Cutting down the book to meet the time frame of the film, Goldenberg explained, became &quot;clearer when [he] figured out that the organising principle of the screenplay was to narrate Harry&#x27;s emotional journey&quot;. He and Yates &quot;looked for every opportunity to get everything [they] could in there. And where [they] couldn&#x27;t, to sort of pay homage to it, to have it somewhere in the background or to feel like it could be taking place off-screen&quot;.

One cut Goldenberg had to make, which he &quot;hated&quot; to do, was the absence of Quidditch, the Wizarding sport. &quot;The truth is that any movie made of this book, whoever made it, that had included the Quidditch subplot would have been a lesser film&quot;, he said. In the book, Ron grows as a character by trying out for the Quidditch team. &quot;Ron facing challenges and coming into his own in the same way that Harry is, we tried to get that into the film in other ways, as much as possible. So, you feel like, if not the details of that story, at least the spirit of it is present in the film&quot;. The change disappointed actor Rupert Grint who had been &quot;quite looking forward to the Quidditch stuff&quot;.

In a significant scene in the book, Harry sees a memory of his own father humiliating Snape in their school days, and Snape insulting his mother after she stood up for him. In the film, it is abbreviated to an &quot;idea&quot;, in Goldenberg&#x27;s words. &quot;It&#x27;s an iconic moment when you realise your parents are normal, flawed human beings. ... Things get trimmed out, but I kept the meat of that in there – and that was what really gave me the coming-of-age story.&quot; Young Lily Potter did not appear at all, but promotional screenshots showed unknown teenager Susie Shinner in the role.

The scene at St Mungo&#x27;s, the hospital where Harry and friends run into classmate Neville Longbottom and learn that his parents were tortured into insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange, was cut because it required the construction of a new set. The main purpose of the action of the scene was relocated to the Room of Requirement after one of Dumbledore&#x27;s Army&#x27;s lessons. Also, to speed up the film&#x27;s climax, several events in the Ministry leading up to Harry&#x27;s battle with Voldemort were removed, including the brain room. Mrs. Weasley&#x27;s encounter with a boggart at Grimmauld Place, Ron, Hermione and Malfoy becoming prefects, the appearance of Mundungus Fletcher, and Firenze teaching Divination followed suit.

The character of Kreacher the house-elf, who was included in the script only at Rowling&#x27;s request, has a larger part in the book than the film. In the novel, he is seen saving some of the Black family&#x27;s artefacts which the Order of the Phoenix throw away, including a locket that ends up being extremely important in the seventh book. &quot;It was kind of tricky to raise that in our story, because it&#x27;s for so much later&quot;, Yates said. &quot;We figured we can probably introduce it later, and that&#x27;s the approach we took&quot;. Whilst Kreacher remained, all parts involving Dobby were cut, and his important actions were given to other characters.

Rita Skeeter, the journalist played by Miranda Richardson in &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;, was also removed. In the book, Hermione blackmails her into writing an article that supports Harry as the rest of the wizarding world denies his claims. Richardson noted that &quot;it&#x27;s never gonna be the book on film, exactly. ... They&#x27;ll take certain aspects from the book and make it something that they hope is going to be commercial and that people want to see&quot;.

==Release==
===Marketing===

The first trailer was released on 17 November 2006, attached to another WB film, &quot;Happy Feet&quot;. It was made available online on 20 November 2006, on the &quot;Happy Feet&quot; website. The international trailer debuted online on 22 April 2007 at 14:00 UTC. On 4 May 2007, the US trailer was shown before &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;.

Three posters released on the Internet that showed Harry accompanied by six classmates, including Hermione Granger, generated some controversy by the media. They were essentially the same picture, though one advertised the IMAX release. In one poster, the profile of Hermione, played by Emma Watson, was made curvier as the outline of her breasts was enhanced. Melissa Anelli, webmistress of noted fan site The Leaky Cauldron, wrote:

The video game version, designed by EA UK, was released 25 June 2007, as well as &quot;Harry Potter: Mastering Magic&quot; mobile game by EA Mobile. Lego produced just one set, a model of Hogwarts, the lowest number of sets for a film so far. NECA produced a series of action figures, while a larger array of smaller figures was also produced by PopCo Entertainment, a Corgi International company.

===Theatrical release===
The film was the third &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film to be given a simultaneous release in conventional theatres and IMAX. The IMAX release featured the full movie in 2D and the final 20 minutes of the film in 3D. According to estimates in March 2007, by Warner Bros., the film would debut on over 10,000 theatre screens during the summer.

Previews of the film began in March 2007 in the Chicago area. Under tight security to prevent piracy, WB had security guards patrol the aisles, looking for cell phone cameras or small recording devices, at a preview in Japan. The world premiere took place in Tokyo, Japan on 28 June 2007. MySpace users could bring copies of their online profiles to gain free admission to sneak previews in eight different cities across the country on 28 June 2007. The UK premiere took place on 3 July 2007 in London&#x27;s Odeon Leicester Square, during which author J. K. Rowling made a public appearance. The US premiere took place on 8 July in Los Angeles. After the premiere, the three young stars of the film series, Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson, were honoured with a ceremony where their handprints, footprints, and &quot;wandprints&quot; were placed in the cement in front of Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre.

Originally, Warner Bros. set the Australian release date as 6 September 2007, nearly two months after the majority of other release dates. However, after complaints from the Australian community, including a petition garnering 2,000 signatures the date was pulled back to 11 July 2007. The release dates of the film in the UK and US were also moved back, both from 13 July, to 12 and 11 July, respectively.

Even though the book is the longest in the series (over 700 pages), the film is 138 minutes long (2 hours and 18 minutes), the second shortest in the entire film series.

===Home media===
The DVDs included additional scenes, a feature showing a day in the life of Natalia Tena, who played Nymphadora Tonks, an A&amp;E documentary about the films and books, and a featurette on film editing in &quot;Phoenix&quot;. The DVD-ROM features a timeline and a sneak peek of the next film, &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot; (2009). The HD DVD and Blu-ray contain additional features, such as the &quot;in-movie experience&quot;, a video commentary in which members of Dumbledore&#x27;s Army share their favourite moments from the production of the film, and &quot;focus points&quot; featurettes on how certain scenes of the film were made. The HD DVD also includes an exclusive feature called &quot;community screening&quot;, which enables owners of the HD DVD to watch the film together over the Internet. &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot; was the seventh best-selling DVD of 2007, with 10.14 million units. The high-definition DVDs had combined sales of 179,500 copies, with more units coming from the Blu-ray version. The film overall made a revenue of $200.2 million from home video sales in the US.

There was also a third DVD with extras featuring a behind-the-scenes look at the sets of the movie. This can only be found in those purchased at Target stores (Future Shop in Canada) since it is a Target exclusive. The package included a one-time-only code that activated a digital copy of the film, which may be played on a computer with Windows Media Player. The digital copy is not playable on Macintosh or Apple Inc. iPod devices. This issue was partially addressed, with the film being made available on the iTunes Store in the UK but not the US.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened to a worldwide 5-day opening of $333 million, the fourteenth-biggest opening of all time. In the United States, tickets for hundreds of midnight showings of the film, bought from online ticket-seller Fandango, were sold out, making up approximately 90% of the site&#x27;s weekly ticket sales. In the US and Canada, midnight screenings (very early morning on 11 July) brought in $12 million from 2,311 midnight exhibitions making the showings &quot;the most successful batch of midnight exhibitions ever&quot;. In one-night earnings, &quot;Phoenix&quot; is behind only &quot;At World&#x27;s End&quot;, which had debuted four hours earlier on its date. In studio documents leaked in July 2010, it was revealed the film &quot;lost&quot; Warner Bros. about $167 million.

In North America, &quot;Phoenix&quot; earned an additional $32.2 million on Wednesday, post-midnight showings, making it the biggest single-day Wednesday gross in box office history, with a total of $44.2 million from 4,285 theatres. That amount topped Sony Pictures&#x27; &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;, which held the record since 2004 with its $40.4 million take on a Wednesday, until this record was broken in 2009 by &quot;&quot; with $62 million. It was also the fifth-biggest opening day for a movie in history, at the time, surpassing &quot;At World&#x27;s End&#x27;s&quot; $42.9 million. It earned $1.9 million from a record-breaking 91 IMAX screens, the highest opening day ever for any IMAX day of the week, beating &quot;Spider-Man 3&#x27;s&quot; $1.8 million. In the UK the result was similar. The film made £16.5 million during its opening 4-day run, breaking the UK box office record for the biggest 4-day opening weekend ever.

&quot;Phoenix&quot;″s gross was at $292.4 million in the US and Canada, making it the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2007 in these regions, and at £49.2 million, or $101.4 million in the UK. Internationally, it has grossed $648 million, the seventh-highest grosser ever overseas, for a worldwide total of $942 million making it the second-highest-grossing film of the year closely behind &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot;″s $960 million gross. It became the sixth-highest-grossing film in history at the time, the second-highest-grossing &quot;Potter&quot; film worldwide, and the second &quot;Potter&quot; film to break the $900 million mark, as well as the fourth-highest-grossing &quot;Potter&quot; film in the franchise behind &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot;″s $1.341 billion, &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;″s $974 million, &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot;″s $960 million and the highest-grossing 2007 film in Australia and the UK.

Pictures announced that the film has made over $35 million on IMAX screens, worldwide, with an impressive per-screen average of $243,000 making it the highest-grossing live-action IMAX release in history. In South Africa the film opened at number 1 with a total of $944,082.00, being screened at 87 theatres.

===Critical response===

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;It&#x27;s not easy to take the longest &quot;Harry Potter&quot; book and streamline it into the shortest HP movie, but director David Yates does a bang up job of it, creating an &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot; that&#x27;s entertaining and action-packed.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 71 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film 2.5 of 4 stars saying &quot;Harry no longer has as much joy.&quot; The review by Charles Frederick of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; was headlined &quot;Potter film is the best and darkest yet&quot;. Colin Bertram of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; gave the film four out of four stars, calling it the best &quot;Potter&quot; film yet and wrote that &quot;die-hard Potter addicts will rejoice that Yates has distilled J. K. Rowling&#x27;s broad universe with care and reverence&quot;. Mark Adams of &quot;The Sunday Mirror&quot;, while giving the film four out of five stars, called it &quot;a dark and delicious delight [and] a must-see movie&quot;. Rene Rodriguez of &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; gave the film three stars out of four and wrote that the film &quot;is the first installment in the soon-to-be series-of-seven that doesn&#x27;t seem like just another spinoff capitalizing on the money-minting Harry Potter brand name. Instead, Phoenix feels like a real &#x27;movie&#x27;&quot;.

Imelda Staunton&#x27;s performance as Dolores Umbridge and Helena Bonham Carter&#x27;s as Bellatrix Lestrange were widely acclaimed; Staunton was described as &quot;coming close to stealing the show&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot; and the &quot;perfect choice for the part&quot; and &quot;one of the film&#x27;s greatest pleasures&quot; by &quot;Variety&quot;. Bonham Carter was said to be a &quot;shining but underused talent&quot; by &quot;The Times&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; further praised Alan Rickman&#x27;s portrayal of Severus Snape, writing that he &quot;may have outdone himself; seldom has an actor done more with less than he does here&quot;. Newcomer Evanna Lynch, playing Luna Lovegood, also received good word from a number of reviewers, including the &quot;New York Times&quot;, which declared her &quot;spellbinding&quot;.

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also lauded the three principal actors&#x27; achievements, especially Radcliffe: &quot;One of the joys of this film is watching Daniel Radcliffe grow so impressively into the role of Harry. He digs deep into the character and into Harry&#x27;s nightmares. It&#x27;s a sensational performance, touching all the bases from tender to fearful&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s review also classified the film as better than the previous four instalments in the series, by losing the &quot;candy-ass aspect&quot; of the first two and &quot;raising the bar&quot; from the &quot;heat and resonance&quot; of the third and fourth. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the film &quot;the best of the series so far, [with] the laughs, the jitters and the juice to make even nonbelievers wild about Harry&quot;.

Leo Lewis of &quot;The Times&quot; (London) expressed disappointment that the three main actors were not able to fully advance the emotional sides of their respective characters, weakening the film. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; complained about a &quot;lousy&quot; storyline, alleging that the first twenty minutes of the film, when Harry is put on trial for performing magic outside of school and threatened with expulsion, but is cleared of all charges, did not advance the plot. Kirk Honeycutt of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote that &quot;Phoenix&quot; is &quot;quite possibly the least enjoyable of the [series] so far&quot;, and that despite &quot;several eye-catching moments&quot;, &quot;the magic – movie magic, that is – is mostly missing&quot;. The review also criticised the under use of the &quot;cream of British acting&quot;, noting the brief appearances of Helena Bonham Carter, Maggie Smith, Emma Thompson, David Thewlis, Richard Griffiths, and Julie Walters.

<text>John Joseph Podres (September 30, 1932 – January 13, 2008) was an American left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played in the majors from 1953 to 1969, spending most of his career with the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers. Podres won four World Series titles with the Dodgers. He is best known for pitching a shutout in game 7 of the 1955 World Series to give the Dodgers their first championship.

==Professional baseball career==
Podres was born in Witherbee, New York, in 1932. He was of Lithuanian–Polish descent.

Podres was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers as an amateur free agent before the 1951 season. He started his professional baseball career that year with the Hazard Bombers of the Mountain States League. With the Bombers, he had a 21–9 win–loss record and a 1.67 earned run average (ERA), leading the league in wins and ERA.

After spending one more season in the minors in 1952, Podres made his major league debut with the Dodgers in 1953. He went 9–4 and helped the Dodgers win the National League (NL) championship. In the 1953 World Series, he made one start, taking the loss, and the Dodgers lost the series. Podres then went 11–7 in 1954.

In 1955, Podres went 9–10, and the Dodgers won the NL pennant. After the Dodgers lost the first two games of the 1955 World Series to the New York Yankees, Podres pitched a complete game, seven-hit victory on his 23rd birthday in game 3. The series went to a deciding seventh game, with Podres getting the start. Considered one of the most unlikely game 7 starters in World Series history because of his regular season record, Podres pitched a 2–0 shutout to help the Dodgers win their first and only World Series title in Brooklyn. For his performance in the World Series, he was given the first-ever World Series Most Valuable Player Award and was presented with a red two-seater Corvette. He also won the Babe Ruth Award and was later named the Sportsman of the Year by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;.

Podres was out of baseball in 1956 due to military service. He returned to the Dodgers in 1957 and had his best season, going 12–9 and leading the NL with a 2.66 ERA, 155 ERA+, 1.082 WHIP, and six shutouts.

In 1958, after the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles, Podres went 13–15 and was an All-Star for the first time. In 1959, he went 14–9, helping the Dodgers win the NL. He made two starts in the 1959 World Series, going 1–0, and the Dodgers won the series.

In 1960, Podres went 14–12 and made both of the All-Star teams that year. In 1961, he went 18–5, setting his major league career-high in wins.

In 1962, Podres went 15–13 and was an All-Star for the fourth and final time. In 1963, he went 14–12, and the Dodgers won the NL. He made one start in the 1963 World Series, winning it, and the Dodgers won the series. From 1957 to 1963, Podres pitched over 180 innings and won over 10 games every year.

Podres&#x27; play then started to decline. He went 0–2 in limited action in 1964. In 1965, he went 7–6, and the Dodgers won the NL. Podres did not play in the 1965 World Series, which the Dodgers won.

In 1966, the Dodgers traded Podres to the Detroit Tigers, for whom he played through the 1967 season. He spent 1968 in the minors and then came back for one season with the San Diego Padres in 1969 before retiring as a player.

In his 15-year MLB career, Podres had a 148–116 record, a 3.68 ERA, 1,435 strikeouts, and a 105 ERA+. He was at his best in the World Series; in four World Series, he went 4–1 with a 2.11 ERA and 18 strikeouts. As a hitter, Podres had a .190 career regular season batting average and a .313 batting average in the World Series.

==Later life==
After his playing career ended, Podres served as the pitching coach for the Padres, Boston Red Sox, Minnesota Twins, and Philadelphia Phillies for 23 seasons between 1973 and 1996. Among the pitchers he worked with were Frank Viola and Curt Schilling.

In 2002, Podres was inducted into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame.

Podres later settled in Queensbury, New York. He died in Glens Falls, New York, in 2008 at age 75 after being hospitalized for heart and kidney ailments and a leg infection. Podres was survived by his wife of 41 years, the former Joni Taylor of Ice Follies fame, and his two sons, Joe and John Jr. He is interred at St. Peter and Paul Cemetery in Moriah, New York, which is in the Adirondack Park.

<doc id="670410" wikidata="Q5450897" url="?curid=670410" title="Finns Point">
<text>Finns Point is a small promontory in Pennsville Township, Salem County, New Jersey, and New Castle County, Delaware, located at the southwest corner of the cape of Penns Neck, on the east bank of the Delaware River near its mouth on Delaware Bay. Due to the wording of the original charter defining the boundaries of New Jersey and Delaware, part of the promontory is actually enclosed within the state of Delaware&#x27;s border, due to tidal flow and the manner in which the borders between New Jersey and Delaware were first laid out. Therefore, this portion of Finns Point, also called The Baja, is an exclave of Delaware, cut off from the rest of the state by Delaware Bay. The area, the westernmost point in New Jersey, is about south of the city of Wilmington, and directly across the Delaware River from the New Castle area, and the Delaware River entrance to the Chesapeake &amp; Delaware Canal. Pea Patch Island, part of the state of Delaware, sits in the channel of the river facing the promontory.

The area in Delaware was previously protected as Killcohook National Wildlife Refuge but is now a confined disposal facility used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

==17th century==
At the time of European colonization in the 17th century the Delaware River was known as the South River and the Salem River was known as Varkens Kill, or Hogg Creek.

Tradition holds that a settlement was first planted by Finns as part of the colony of New Sweden in 1638. among them, the family of Anders Sinicka, whose surname has many variations.

 This is recalled in the name of the road running along the shore south of the Port of Salem, Sinnicksons Landing Road. which bears the name of the a prominent Salem County family, including Thomas Sinnickson and his descendants.

In 1641, a group of 60 settlers (20 families) from the New Haven Colony (in today&#x27;s Connecticut) purchased land along the kill. In 1643, the Governor of New Sweden built Fort Nya Elfsborg, just east of present-day Salem, New Jersey, and allowed the Varkens Kill settlement to remain if they swore allegiance to Sweden.

In 1651, Fort Casimir was constructed directly across the river on the west bank of the Delaware and by 1655, the region came under the control of New Netherland, which it remained until 1664 when the English overran the settlements on the south banks of the Delaware. The peninsula on the east banks became West Jersey. The town at Salem was founded in 1675 by John Fenwick, a Quaker.

==Military facilities==
The promontory is the location of Finns Point National Cemetery, a military cemetery used in the American Civil War for Union and Confederate soldiers who died while at Fort Delaware on Pea Patch Island. It was also the location of Fort Mott, constructed after the Civil War and used up through World War I to protect the E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company facilities upriver at Carneys Point Township, New Jersey, as well as the port of Philadelphia. The fort is now part of Fort Mott State Park.

<doc id="670411" wikidata="Q3242002" url="?curid=670411" title="Tweed New Haven Airport">
<text>Tweed-New Haven Regional Airport is a public airport located three miles southeast of downtown New Haven, in New Haven County, Connecticut, United States.

New Haven Airport is partly located in the City of New Haven (which owns the airport) and partly in the Town of East Haven. It one of two airports with regularly scheduled commercial service in Connecticut, the other being Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks.

Tweed Airport is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021, in which it is categorized as a non-hub primary commercial service facility.

Until 1961, the airport was known as New Haven Municipal Airport – at which time it was renamed for its first airport manager, John H. Tweed.

==History==
Ground-breaking ceremonies for New Haven Municipal Airport occurred on November 11, 1929. The facility was later dedicated and opened for traffic on August 29, 1931, as the New Haven Municipal Airport. On June 25, 1961, it was renamed in honor of John H. &quot;Jack&quot; Tweed – its first airport manager.

=== Historical airline service ===
The first airline to serve New Haven was Li-Con Airways, Inc., (Long Island-Connecticut Airways) of Islip, Long Island, New York. That carrier commenced service on November 10, 1933, and provided passenger and airmail service until July 1934. In the fall of 1934, American Airlines began serving New Haven as a stop on flights between New York and Boston and continued service until 1960. The American service was then replaced by Allegheny Airlines and Allegheny Commuter (with the latter being operated by commuter air carriers Suburban Airlines and Pennsylvania Airlines). Allegheny operated British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven jets into Tweed in the mid-1970s. Eastern Airlines initiated service in 1948 and then left in 1970 due to legal challenges pertaining to a runway extension. Eastern returned briefly from 1972 to 1974 with Boeing 727 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 &quot;Whisperjet&quot; service nonstop to Baltimore-Washington (BWI), Washington-National (DCA) and Boston. The carrier also offered one-stop service to Miami (MIA) and Atlanta (ATL).

====1970s and 1980s====
Fixed base operator (FBO) New Haven Airways started scheduled flights in 1978 and became New Haven&#x27;s hometown airline, NewAir, in 1980. The airline operated flights to New York&#x27;s JFK and LaGuardia Airports, Philadelphia, Baltimore/Washington International, and Washington National Airports, with de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter, Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante and Short 360 commuter turboprop aircraft. NewAir ended all service in 1985.

Competing was Pilgrim Airlines based at Groton–New London, to New York–JFK and LaGuardia, Boston, Washington (DCA) on de Havilland Canada Twin Otters and Fokker F27 turboprops. By the mid-1980s the two airlines merged and were then purchased by Hartford-based Business Express Airlines, which initially flew only from Brainard Airport to Boston and Philadelphia. Business Express established a code-sharing relationship with Delta Air Lines and became a Delta Connection feeder airline in 1985.

In 1987 Hyannis-based Provincetown-Boston Airlines (PBA), a commuter airline for PeoplExpress Airlines (which was subsequently merged into Continental Airlines), began flights to New Haven. PBA operating as Continental Express flew Embraer EMB-110s from Tweed to Continental&#x27;s hub at Newark and also to Hyannis and Nantucket, Massachusetts.

USAir Express (operated by commuter air carriers PSA, Piedmont, Allegheny) flew to Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Washington, DC area airports, utilizing Shorts 360, Dash-8 100/300, Dornier 328 and Beechcraft 1900 turboprop aircraft.

Jet flights from New Haven to Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport started in 1985–86, initially on Air Wisconsin&#x27;s BAe-146s operating code sharing service as &quot;United Express&quot; on behalf of United Airlines. From 1991 to 1996, United Airlines Boeing 737-300s and 737-500s flew non-stop to O&#x27;Hare. Tweed was also served by Atlantic Coast Airlines operating code sharing service as United Express flying Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia turboprops to Washington Dulles Airport.

Continental Express (flown by PBA) service continued with Beechcraft 1900 and ATR 42 turboprops, while Business Express flights were operated with Saab 340 and Beechcraft 1900 turboprops.

Other small air carriers serving New Haven over the years include Ocean Airlines, Astec Air East, East Hampton Aire, Trans International Express, Trans World Express operated by Pocono Airlines on behalf of Trans World Airlines (TWA), and Northwest Airlink operated by Precision Airlines and Northeast Express Regional Airlines on behalf of Northwest Airlines.

====1990s====
By the late 1990s service began to decline to the airport. Business Express service ended, as it put its Saab-340s out of service after its acquisition by AMR Corporation. Continental Express flights ended in 1994, returned in 1995, and then left again on December 17, 1997.

===21st century===
Comair (Delta Connection) began service to HVN in 2004 with three daily flights to Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky International Airport using CRJ-200 aircraft. The airline ceased operations at HVN in January 2006.

Pan Am Clipper Connection, operated by Boston-Maine Airways, began non-stop flights to Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, Hanscom Field, and Pease International Airport on March 8, 2007, using 19-seat Jetstream 31 aircraft. Service ended on July 30, 2007.

This left US Airways Express (Piedmont) as the only airline at Tweed, which in 2015 became American Eagle following the American Airlines-US Airways merger.

American Eagle was the only airline serving New Haven year-round. As of November 29, 2017, PSA replaced Piedmont&#x27;s Dash 8-100 turboprop service with three daily round trips to and from Philadelphia on Canadair CRJ-200, Canadair CRJ-700 and occasionally Canadair CRJ-900 regional jets. Weekly flights to Charlotte Douglas International Airport started on December 22, 2018. Service by Republic Airways to Philadelphia and flying the Embraer E-175 commenced on May 3, 2019. On September 9, 2020, all service was shifted to Charlotte then subsequently canceled one month later on October 7, 2020. American Eagle service resumed on January 5, 2021, after a renewal of the government-subsidized CARES Act created by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Service was shifted back to Philadelphia with one daily flight; however, all service ended once again on September 30, 2021.

United Airlines connects to New Havens&#x27; Union Station in downtown New Haven via Amtrak train to/from Newark Liberty International Airport ; the airport code for New Haven, in this case, is , but United does not fly to Tweed.

Today, the airport is operated by AFCO AvPORTS of Dulles, Virginia – a subsidiary of Goldman Sachs, under contract with the Tweed-New Haven Regional Airport Authority.

On April 18, 2019, Shoreline Aviation – based at the airport – announced a merger with Cape Air. This popular seaplane service was expected to continue connecting HVN with the New York Skyports Seaplane Base in New York City.

On June 14, 2019, Southern Airways Express, a Florida-based-Part 135 commuter carrier, began seasonal nonstop service between Tweed and Nantucket, Massachusetts.

On May 6, 2021, Houston-based low-cost startup Avelo Airlines announced that it would be opening its first East Coast base at Tweed New Haven. The airline operates a fleet of Boeing 737-700 aircraft and initial routes from Tweed would be to Fort Lauderdale, Fort Myers, Orlando, and Tampa beginning on November 3, 2021. Before service even started, two more routes were announced to Sarasota and West Palm Beach. Service began as planned on November 3 with the first flight departing New Haven to Orlando. As of 2024, service had been expanded to 25 cities.

On August 7, 2024, Breeze Airways announced it will be launching 10 flights in direct competition with Avelo Airlines current routes from New Haven. This will expand operations from Tweed New Haven by adding more flight operations to the already small airport and increase competition. Breeze Airways will begin operating these new routes out of New Haven in December 2024 and February 2025.

==== Airport expansion ====
In October 2024, the airport received a $4 million grant for the construction of a new, terminal on its east side. When complete, the new, six-gate terminal will replace the existing one on the west side, built in 1931 and functionally obsolete. The project is expected to cost between $70,000,000 and $100,000,000.

The runway will also be expanded as part of this long-awaited airport expansion project. Additional funding was secured for the expansion project in February 2024, when the airport received a $2 million grant.

===== Expansion controversy =====
The future of the airport has been the subject of disagreement between the City of New Haven and the Town of East Haven. New Haven has advocated airport runway expansion, which would be required to attract more commercial air service and larger planes. Some groups of local residents have historically been opposed, saying that expansion would negatively affect the local environment and health of New Haven and East Haven residents.

In 2002, the FAA and the State of Connecticut had approved the airport&#x27;s layout plan which specified the installation of safety overruns and extending the length of Tweed&#x27;s main runway 02–20. In 2007, the FAA and the State of Connecticut approved the addition of safety overruns to Tweed&#x27;s main runway. The City of New Haven issued the wetlands and building permits for the project, but officials in East Haven voted to reject the upgrade proposal and deny permits for work on the East Haven (north) side; the Airport Authority and the City of New Haven filed a lawsuit against the Town of East Haven to allow work on the north overrun, and won.

Since the lawsuit, the Airport Authority has completed the work for the $25 million safety overruns on the New Haven (south) side of the airport, as well as the East Haven (north) side.

On March 16, 2009, New Haven and East Haven announced that an agreement had been reached, keeping the main runway at , with all obstructions in the approach zones to be removed. Departures are to be capped at 30 per day, with a passenger cap of 180,000 boardings per year.

In July 2014, the Tweed New Haven Airport Authority and the City of New Haven sought federal grant money as a part of the Small Community Air Service Development Program. Language within this air service proposal described the airport&#x27;s hope to lengthen the main runway past . In the same month, the airport also sought an increase in annually-appropriated State of Connecticut funds, specifically to pave the runway safety areas in order to expand the length of the runway. This legislation was not enacted and federal money for air service development was not granted. In 2015, Mayor Toni Harp of New Haven and Rep. Rosa DeLauro wrote a joint letter to residents pledging their support for runway expansion.

Opposition to the airport runway expansion was strong among some local residents, resulting in the formation of a small grassroots campaign. Tensions flared up at community meetings on May 20 and 21, 2015. East Haven voters and Mayor Joseph A. Maturo, Jr. continued to oppose Tweed&#x27;s expansion proposals.

In November 2015, the Airport Authority&#x27;s board of directors voted to sue the State of Connecticut in Federal court.

Tim Larson, former executive director and State Senator for East Hartford, described Tweed as &quot;an airport at a critical juncture. Commercial carriers are interested in servicing the Southern Connecticut market but will not consider coming to Tweed until the runway is lengthened.&quot; He added that &quot;American (formerly US Airways), may discontinue our existing service when in the next few years they replace the current Dash-8 aircraft with planes that require a longer runway.&quot; Activist residents responded with a new effort against the expansion and a reporting app for noise, health, and quality of life complaints. East Haven Mayor Maturo described the lawsuit as &quot;foolish&quot;.

In July 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled in favor of the airport. In a unanimous opinion, the court ruled that the state statute limiting the length of the runway is preempted by federal law, and is therefore invalid.

In December 2019, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong submitted an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States seeking a challenge to the runway expansion.

On March 23, 2020, the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear Connecticut&#x27;s appeal to the proposed runway expansion. Having exhausted all legal options, the state can no longer prevent the airport from expanding its runway and adding additional services.

On May 6, 2021, Avelo Airlines announced that their new East Coast hub would be located at Tweed and would hire 100 new employees to be based in New Haven. Avelo Airlines announced that flights would begin in the third quarter of 2021. It was also announced that AFCO AvPORTS would build a new terminal on the East Haven side of the airport in addition to expanding the length of the runway. Service began with flights to four destinations in Florida, but it quickly expanded to 14 destinations in eight states. During Avelo&#x27;s first full year of service, over 340,000 enplanements were recorded, an all-time record for the airport. The growth in passenger totals further highlighted the need for the expansion, with the existing terminal experiencing overcrowding issues and no longer being able to efficiently handle the airport&#x27;s needs.

The Federal Aviation Administration approved the expansion plans in December 2023. The airport received grants in 2024 for the new terminal&#x27;s construction.

==Facilities and aircraft==

==Accidents and incidents==

* On March 1, 1958, an American Airlines Convair CV-240-O with eight passengers destined for Bridgeport Airport crashed on the runway after the landing gear was retracted before the aircraft had lifted off. The plane landed on its belly and a small engine fire occurred. There were no injuries.
* On June 7, 1971, an Allegheny Airlines Convair 580 with 30 passengers arriving from Groton-New London Airport crashed, striking cottages from the runway. 28 occupants died. It was blamed on pilot error.
* On January 7, 2011, a Bombardier Dash 8-100, operating as Piedmont Airlines flight 4507 from Philadelphia International Airport to New Haven was struck by lightning over the Long Island Sound. The captain reported electrical problems and diverted safely to Long Island MacArthur Airport due to better weather. The flight carried 33 passengers who were subsequently bused to New Haven.
* On August 9, 2013, a Rockwell International Turbo Commander 690B from Teterboro Airport in New Jersey crashed into two houses in an East Haven residential neighborhood while on approach to this airport. The impact and the resulting fires destroyed both houses. The incident resulted in the deaths of both people on the plane (the 54-year-old pilot Bill Henningsgaard and his 17-year-old son Maxwell) and two children in one of the homes (13-year-old Sade Brantley and her 1-year-old sister Madisyn Mitchell).
* On February 22, 2017, a single-engine Piper PA-38-112, which was operated by the Connecticut Flight Academy, crashed southeast of Runway 2 in a swamp. This is the second deadliest crash for the flight academy. The student pilot was killed on impact, the flight instructor was listed in critical condition. Eyewitnesses reported seeing the plane nosedive prior to crashing. The NTSB wrapped up its investigation and published a final report on the accident on February 12, 2018. A plastic valve inside the fuel selector was found to have failed in such a position as to restrict fuel flow to the engine, resulting in a total loss of engine power due to fuel starvation. Final blame was shared between the flight school, whom the NTSB said failed to properly address progressive wear and binding of the part, as well as the flight instructor&#x27;s exceeding the critical angle of attack for the plane while attempting an emergency return to the airport, resulting in an aerodynamic stall/spin.
* On June 30, 2022, at about 5:20 pm, a single-engine prop plane headed from Florida to Massachusetts crashed into the Quinnipiac River after the plane began to experience some engine troubles over New Haven. The two people on board radioed into Tweed New Haven Airport alerting them to the engine troubles. Tweed Airport personnel advised the pilot to attempt to make it to the airport to land the plane. The pilot stated that he would not make it and would ditch into the river. Both persons and a dog were rescued thanks to nearby boaters and bystanders at the Quinnipiac Marina. Fire crews along with other partners were able to safely pull the plane out of the water. The incident is being investigated by the NTSB and FAA.

<text>The Param Vir Chakra (PVC) is India&#x27;s highest military decoration, awarded for displaying distinguished acts of valour during wartime. Param Vir Chakra translates as the &quot;Wheel of the Ultimate Brave&quot;, and the award is granted for &quot;most conspicuous bravery in the presence of the enemy&quot;. , the medal has been awarded 21 times, of which 14 were posthumous and 16 arose from actions in Indo-Pakistani conflicts. Of the 21 awardees, 20 have been from the Indian Army and one has been from the Indian Air Force. Major Somnath Sharma was the first recipient. A number of state governments of India as well as ministries of the central government provide allowances and rewards to recipients of the PVC (or their family members in case of the recipient&#x27;s death).

The history of present-day Indian gallantry awards can be traced back to the rule of the East India Company, when the first formal award was instituted by Lord William Bentinck in 1834 as the Order of Merit, later renamed the Indian Order of Merit in 1902. During the First World War, the British awards system was adopted and continued through the Second World War. Post-independence, new awards were instituted on 26January 1950, with retroactive effect from 15August 1947. The PVC is equivalent to the Victoria Cross in the United Kingdom and the Medal of Honor in the United States.

== History ==
The history of modern-day Indian gallantry awards can be traced back to the rule of the East India Company. Gold medals were awarded to Indian officers for the first time in 1795, with the first recipient being Subedar Abdul Kader of the 5thMadras Native Infantry. The chain of the gold medal awarded to Kader was inscribed with the words &quot;For Conduct and Courage on All Occasions&quot;. In 1834 the Order of Merit was established by the then Governor-General of India, Lord William Bentinck. The decoration was renamed the Indian Order of Merit (IOM) in 1902, and Indians considered it to be &quot;the most coveted gallantry award&quot; until the Victoria Cross (VC)—the highest award for gallantry in the British Empire—was extended to Indians in 1911. The VC was awarded to 153 Indian and British soldiers of the British Indian Army, and civilians under its command, from 1857 until Indian independence in 1947.

During the First World War, in addition to the IOM, the award system of the British Indian Army was expanded. Based on the British practice for recognising actions of gallantry, senior officers would be awarded the Distinguished Service Order, junior officers the Military Cross, and enlisted men with the Military Medal. This system continued through the Second World War.

Post-independence, the British honours and awards system in India informally came to an end. A short time later, Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru decided to give gallantry awards for the ongoing conflict in Jammu and Kashmir. Although India and Pakistan still had the option to award British honours, the leaders felt that it would not make sense to give the same honour to personnel from opposing forces. Accordingly, in June 1948 it was decided to institute new Indian awards for gallantry: the Param Vir Chakra(PVC), Maha Vir Chakra(MVC), and Vir Chakra(VrC). After the PVC, the MVC and VrC are the second and third highest gallantry awards during wartime.

Nehru entrusted the implementation of the PVC to Major General Hira Lal Atal, the first Indian Adjutant general of India. He in turn requested Savitri Khanolkar, the wife of an Indian Army officer, Vikram Khanolkar of the Sikh Regiment, to design the medal for the PVC. Coincidentally, the first PVC would be awarded to Major Somnath Sharma, the brother-in-law of Khanolkar&#x27;s daughter.

Despite gaining independence from British rule, India still remained a dominion of the United Kingdom. This meant that the Governor-General of India could not approve the establishment of the awards without assent from the British Crown. Therefore, a draft of the Royal Warrant was sent to London for approval by King George VI. However, by mid-1948 it became clear that the King&#x27;s ratification would not be forthcoming for some time. As author Ian Cardozo suggests: &quot;How could the King sanction awards for a war between two members of the Commonwealth? Also, the King would have not even have been a symbolic presence on the awards.&quot;

Therefore, the draft warrants to formally establish the new gallantry awards were not put into effect. On 1January 1949, a ceasefire was implemented in Jammu and Kashmir, and as it was becoming too late to honour acts of heroism from the 1947–1948 Indo-Pakistani War, Nehru forwarded the draft warrants to Governor-General Chakravarti Rajagopalachari to &quot;institute the awards as your own&quot;. But Rajagopalachari felt that, as India was still a dominion, it would be inappropriate for him to establish the awards without the King&#x27;s approval. He instead suggested to Nehru that, as India was to become a republic on 26January 1950, it would be appropriate to announce the establishment of the awards on that date, but with retroactive effect from 15August 1947.

On 26January 1950, now celebrated as Republic Day of India, the PVC was established by Rajendra Prasad, the first President of India, with effect from 15August 1947 (Independence Day of India). Provision was made in the event a PVC recipient was to receive a further award of the medal; if this were to arise, the recipient would receive a bar to their existing PVC, along with a gift of a replica of the &quot;vajra&quot; (club), the weapon of Indra, the god of heaven. , no instances of an individual being conferred with a second PVC have arisen. The medal carries with it the right to use &quot;PVC&quot; as a post-nominal.

== Regulations ==
The regulations of the PVC were set out in &quot;The Gazette of India&quot; the day the award was established, 26 January 1950, as follows:
An amendment to the above regulations on 26 January 1980 saw Clause 12 deleted, and the remaining clauses renumbered accordingly.

== Design specifications ==

The name of the award translates as the &quot;Wheel of the Ultimate Brave&quot;. The medal is a circular bronze disc in diameter. On the obverse, or front, the National Emblem of India appears in the centre on a raised circle surrounded by four copies of the &quot;vajra&quot;, the weapon of Indra, the ancient Vedic king of the gods. The motif symbolizes the sacrifice of Rishi Dadhichi, who gave his bones to the gods to make the &quot;vajra&quot; to kill the demon Vritra. The medal is suspended from a straight-swiveling suspension bar. On the reverse, around a plain centre, are two legends separated by lotus flowers. The words &quot;Param Vir Chakra&quot; are written in Hindi and English. A purple ribbon, long, holds the Param Vir Chakra.

== Recipients ==

The PVC has been awarded 21 times, of which 14 were awarded posthumously and 16 arose from actions in Indo-Pakistani conflicts. Of the 21 awardees, 20 have been from the Indian Army, and one has been from the Indian Air Force. The Grenadiers, with three awards, have received the greatest number of Param Vir Chakras. The various Gorkha Rifle regiments of the Indian Army have received three awards, with the 1, 8, and 11 Gorkha Rifle regiments each having one PVC recipient.

, Flying Officer Nirmal Jit Singh Sekhon, who was awarded the Param Vir Chakra posthumously in 1971, is the only Indian Air Force officer to have been honoured with the medal. Subedar Major Bana Singh, Subedar Sanjay Kumar and Subedar Yogendra Singh Yadav, are the only living recipients of the award.

== Allowances and rewards for the awardees ==
The PVC also carries a cash allowance for those under the rank of lieutenant (or the appropriate service equivalent), and in some cases a cash award. Upon the death of the recipient, the pension is transferred to the spouse until their death or remarriage. In the case of a posthumous recipient who is unmarried, the allowance is paid to their parents. In the case of the award being conferred posthumously on a widow or widower, the allowance is to be paid to their son or unmarried daughter. A monthly stipend of 20,000 is given to the awardee along with their regular pay. The award amount and pension benefits are exempted from income tax. In addition, different ministries under the central government have various financial awards for PVC awardees.

A relatively unknown convention in the Indian Army is for a PVC recipient to be saluted, when in ceremonial uniform, by everyone in the Army irrespective of rank, although no legal provision exists.

=== Allowances by state governments ===
Many Indian states have established individual pension rewards that far exceed the central government&#x27;s stipend for recipients of the PVC.
== Memorials ==

In 2009 Balidan Stambh, the war memorial in Jammu paid tribute to nine Param Vir Chakra awardees who attained martyrdom in Jammu and Kashmir by inscribing their name on the pillars erected in semi circumference for the respective wars in which they participated. Their names are displayed near the eternal flame and as relief mural on the semi circumference wall. 

In September 2014 a memorial has been built in the memory of PVC recipients at Marina Park, Port Blair, in Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It was inaugurated by the Lieutenant Governor of Andaman and Nicobar Lieutenant General Ajay Kumar Singh, in the presence of the Commander-in-Chief Andaman and Nicobar Command, Vice Admiral Pradeep Kumar Chatterjee.

On 2 May 2017, at a ceremony conducted in the National Media Center, New Delhi, Minister of State for Defence Subhash Bhamre inaugurated a campaign to build a &quot;wall of valour&quot; in a thousand educational institutions across the country. The campaign was initiated by the two serving receipts of PVC, Subedar Yogendra Singh Yadav and Naib Subedar Sanjay Kumar. The campaign was named &quot;Vidya Veerta Abhiyan&quot;. The objective is to build a wall of at various educational campuses with the voluntary contributions from the students and the faculty of respective institutions. These walls are to portray all 21 recipients of the PVC along with relevant information.

In 2019 Bronze Busts of all 21 recipients are installed in the Param Yodha Sthal, which is a part of the National War Memorial. The site is adjacent to the main memorial and has informative plaques displaying the citations of the heroes.

On January 23, 2023 (birth anniversary of Subhash Chandra Bose), the Indian government named 21 large uncharted islands in the Andaman Islands after the 21 recipients of the Param Vir Chakra.

== In popular culture ==

<doc id="670421" wikidata="Q940967" url="?curid=670421" title="Musepack">
<text>Musepack or MPC is an open source lossy audio codec, specifically optimized for transparent compression of stereo audio at bitrates of 160–180 (manual set allows bitrates up to 320) kbit/s. It was formerly known as MPEGplus, MPEG+ or MP+.

Development of MPC was initiated in 1997 by Andree Buschmann and later assumed by Frank Klemm, and as of 2004 is maintained by the Musepack Development Team (MDT) with assistance from Buschmann and Klemm. Encoders and decoders are available for Microsoft Windows, Linux and Mac OS X, and plugins for several third-party media players available from the Musepack website, licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) or BSD licenses, and an extensive list of programs supporting the format.

== Technical details ==
Musepack was developed using the MP2 codec as a starting point, but many features have since been added, including:
* subband selectable M/S encoding (as in AAC)
* Huffman coding (as in MP3 and AAC, but more efficient). Since SV8 the bitstream is compressed by highly optimized canonical huffman tables that yields 2% smaller files and faster decoding
* noise substitution techniques (as in ATSC A-52 and MPEG-4 AAC V2)
* pure variable bitrate between 0 and 1300 kbit/s (when needed)

The psychoacoustic model of MPC is based on MPEG ISO model 2, but is extended by CVD (clear voice detection). The quantization algorithm of the MPC encoder performs spectral shaping of the noise, called &quot;adaptive noise shaping&quot; (ANS), in order to overcome the low frequency resolution of the polyphase quadrature filter bands.

MPC uses the APEv2 tag metadata container.

Musepack is mainly optimized for transparent encoding at the &quot;--standard&quot; preset (175-185 kbit/s). Very few optimisations have been made at lower bitrates (like 128 kbit/s). Nevertheless, various listening tests have been conducted in which Musepack has performed well at both lower and higher bitrates.

== Features ==
* Container-independent format. An SV8 MPC is a container file for a Musepack stream. Raw stream encoding is possible.
* Packetized stream allows muxing into audio and video containers (e.g. MKA/MKV, NUT).
* Sample-accurate, fast seeking independent of file length.
* Sample-accurate cutting. Application included in download package (mpccut) allows losslessly cutting stream segments based on selected start/end samples.
* Chapters. Chapter editor (mpcchap) included, for embedding chapters into MPC files.
* No internal clipping.
* Streamable.

== Test results==
Despite being optimized for 100% transparency at moderately high bitrates, MPC has also scored highly on many 128 kbit/s tests. In May 2004, a series of double-blind listening tests (as reported on Slashdot) suggested that Musepack and Ogg Vorbis (which was the 1.1 &quot;aoTuV&quot; fork at the time) were the two best available codecs for high-quality audio compression at bitrates around 128 kbit/s, beating MP3, AAC, WMA, and ATRAC.

Listening tests of MPC:
* 2004 – rjamorim&#x27;s second 128 kbit/s group listening test – between 14 and 27 listeners. MPC and Vorbis tied for first.
* 2003 – rjamorim&#x27;s first 128 kbit/s group listening test – between 14 and 29 listeners. AAC, MPC, Vorbis, and WMA tied for first.
* 2002 – ff123&#x27;s second 128 kbit/s group listening test
* 2001 – ff123&#x27;s 128 kbit/s group listening test

==Hardware and software support==
Devices supporting The Core Pocket Media Player can play MPC. This includes devices running Palm OS, Symbian OS, Windows, Windows CE and Windows Mobile (Pocket PC). All devices with software audio decoding that are supported by Rockbox, including older revisions of iPod, can also play Musepack files. Playback on Roku Photobridge HD is supported with a plugin.
There is a plethora of media players for Android supporting Musepack (among them is the ported Rockbox media player).

Musepack distributes the &quot;libmpcdec&quot; library for decoding MPC content. Various plugins have been developed, using that library, including for the XMMS player (on Unix). Asunder and Jack! The Knife allows ripping Audio CD tracks directly into Musepack files.

<doc id="670425" wikidata="Q1891143" url="?curid=670425" title="Mansfield District">
<text>Mansfield District is a local government district in Nottinghamshire, England. It is named after the town of Mansfield, where the council is based. The district also contains Mansfield Woodhouse (which forms part of the Mansfield urban area) and Warsop.

The neighbouring districts are Bassetlaw, Newark and Sherwood, Ashfield and Bolsover.

==History==
The town of Mansfield had been governed by improvement commissioners from 1823. They were replaced in 1891 when it was incorporated as a municipal borough.

The modern district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The new district covered the whole area of three former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Mansfield Municipal Borough
*Mansfield Woodhouse Urban District
*Warsop Urban District

The new district was named Mansfield after its main town. Unusually for a district taking the same name as a former borough, the new Mansfield district was not granted borough status. Instead charter trustees were established for the area of the former borough of Mansfield, with responsibility for looking after the civic regalia of the town.

Since 2002 the council has been led by a directly elected mayor.

==Governance==
Mansfield District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Nottinghamshire County Council. Warsop is also a civil parish, which is a third tier of local government for that part of the district.

===Political control===
The council has been under Labour majority control since the 2023 election.

The first election to the modern district council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Since 1974 political control of the council has been as follows:

===Leadership===

From 1974 until 2002, political leadership was provided by the leader of the council. Only one person served as leader in that time:
In 2002 the council changed to having a directly elected mayor. The mayors since 2002 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and a By-election in June 2024, the composition of the council (excluding the elected mayor&#x27;s seat) was:

On 25 October 2024, three long standing members of Mansfield Independent Forum defected to Reform UK, marking a new political group on the council.

The next full election is due in May 2027.
===Elections===


Since the last boundary changes in 2023 the district has been divided in 36 wards, each of which elects one councillor. Elections are held every four years.

===Premises===
The council is based at the Civic Centre on Chesterfield Road South in Mansfield. The building was purpose-built for the council at a cost of £6.7million and opened on 1 September 1986.

==Geography==
Mansfield and Mansfield Woodhouse form a single urban area, which also includes Forest Town. The only civil parish in the district is Warsop; the rest of the district, corresponding to the combined area of the pre-1974 borough of Mansfield and Mansfield Woodhouse urban district, is an unparished area. The parish of Warsop contains the settlements of Market Warsop, Church Warsop and Meden Vale plus surrounding rural areas, including areas of woodland which form part of Sherwood Forest. Part of the urban area of Pleasley, most of which is in the Bolsover district of Derbyshire, extends across the boundary into Mansfield district.

<text>Nadezhda Viktorovna &quot;Nadia&quot; Petrova ( ; born 8 June 1982) is a Russian former professional tennis player. A former top-five player in both singles and doubles, she reached a career-high ranking of No. 3 in the world in both disciplines (doing so in doubles on 21 March 2005, then in singles on 15 May 2006). Petrova won a total of 37 titles on the WTA Tour in her career, 13 in singles and 24 in doubles, as well as over $12.4 million in prize money, making her one of the most successful Russian tennis players of all time.

Petrova&#x27;s career highlights in singles include reaching a total of nine Grand Slam quarterfinals across all four major tournaments (including two Grand Slam semifinals at the French Open in 2003 and 2005), and qualifying for the WTA Tour Championships on three separate occasions. Her largest singles titles came at two Tier-I tournaments, Charleston and Berlin in 2006 (during a span in which she won three consecutive tournaments and a career-best 15 matches in a row), one Premier 5 title in Tokyo in 2012, and winning the year-end Tournament of Champions in 2012. From June 2003 to September 2013, Petrova was continuously ranked inside the top 30 (a period of 538 weeks), was inside the top 20 for over 500 of them, and spent over 150 weeks ranked inside the top 10. Over a 10 year period from 2003 to 2012, she finished the year ranked inside the top 30 on every single occasion, and inside the top 20 in all of them except 2011.

Equally successful in doubles, Petrova&#x27;s career highlights included winning the year-ending WTA Championships twice, with Meghann Shaughnessy in 2004, and with compatriot Maria Kirilenko in 2012. With Kirilenko, she also won the bronze medal in the doubles competition at the 2012 Summer Olympics. She also reached two major finals in doubles, doing so at the 2010 US Open with Liezel Huber and the 2012 French Open with Kirilenko. She also won a total of nine Tier I/Premier Mandatory titles (including three in Miami in 2004, 2012 and 2013), was a seven-time Grand Slam doubles semifinalist, a twenty-time major quarterfinalist, and finished with a year-end top-ten ranking four times.

Petrova announced her retirement from professional tennis on 11 January 2017 at the age of 34, due to a multitude of injuries and a nearly three-year absence from the tour (she played her last pro match in April 2014).

==Biography==
===Early life===
Petrova was born in Moscow. Her father Viktor was a hammer thrower, while her mother Nadezhda Ilyina won a bronze medal at the 1976 Montreal Olympics in the 400 m relay. Her father is still an athletics coach, and her mother was an athletics coach until her death in 2013. As a child, Nadia did a lot of travelling around the world with her parents. She eventually settled in Egypt, where she trained with Mohammed Saif and her parents.

===Playing style===
Petrova is an all-court aggressive player who is capable of hitting winners off both wings, but particularly off her back-hand and which she hits flat and with slice. Nadia&#x27;s weaknesses are her movement and exhibiting mental fragility during key points in highly contested matches.

==Career==
===Early years===
As a junior, Petrova won the 1998 French Open, beating Jelena Dokic in the final. The same year, she finished runner-up at the Orange Bowl to Elena Dementieva and she also finished runner-up at the junior event of the 1999 US Open to Lina Krasnoroutskaya. In May 1998, she played her first WTA tournament at the J&amp;S Cup as a wildcard entrant. She also received a wildcard for her home event in Moscow, the Kremlin Cup, where she picked up her first top-20 win over Iva Majoli. By the end of 1999, Petrova had reached the top 100.

In 2000, she reached the third round of the Australian Open and the quarterfinals of the Miami Open, beating Julie Halard-Decugis for her first top-ten win before losing to Lindsay Davenport. She finished the season at No. 50. She reached the fourth round of both French Open and the US Open in 2001 and her ranking hit a high of No. 38 during the season. Petrova also broke through in doubles in 2001, winning her first two WTA Tour titles in Rosmalen and Linz (the latter of which alongside Dokic, by then a top-10 player). However, her 2002 season was marred by injuries causing her singles ranking to drop out of the top 100. During this time, Petrova mainly focused on doubles, reaching the semifinals of the US Open with Nicole Pratt, two Tier I finals in Moscow and Zurich with Dokic, and reaching the top 20.

===2003–2004: First major semifinal, doubles prominence, and top 10 rankings===
At the 2003 Australian Open, Petrova defeated Gréta Arn 6–2, 6–1 and then upset 21st seed Ai Sugiyama 6–4, 6–4 in the second round. She then lost to world No. 15, Patty Schnyder, 2–6, 6–4, 3–6 in the third round.

Petrova was ranked world No. 76 going into the French Open. In the first round, she beat the three-time champion and world No. 12, Monica Seles 6–4, 6–0, on what was to be Seles&#x27; last professional match. She then defeated Silvija Talaja 6–1, 6–1 and Marissa Irvin 6–1, 6–1 to reach the fourth round. Here, Petrova stunned seventh seed and 2001 French Open champion Jennifer Capriati, 6–3, 4–6, 6–3. In the quarterfinals, she won again in three sets over 21st seed Vera Zvonareva 6–1, 4–6, 6–3 to reach her first ever Grand Slam semifinal. Petrova faced world No. 2, Kim Clijsters, and despite having a set point in the first set, Petrova was beaten in straight sets 7–5, 6–1. However, her ranking increased to world No. 30.

Petrova reached the semifinals of Rosmalen, defeating Elena Dementieva en route but lost to world No. 3, Justine Henin, in three sets. At Wimbledon, Petrova was seeded 29th and made it to the third round, before losing to Venus Williams, 1–6, 2–6.
She was seeded 19th at the US Open and defeated 14th seed Amanda Coetzer, 6–0, 6–1 in the third round. In the fourth round, Petrova lost to third seed Lindsay Davenport 0–6, 7–6, 2–6. She continued her success by reaching the semifinals of Zurich, beating fellow Russian, world No. 8 and US Open finalist, Elena Dementieva, before losing to Henin 4–6, 4–6.

The following week in Linz, Petrova beat Paola Suárez and Patty Schnyder to reach her first WTA Tour singles final. However, she fell to Ai Sugiyama 5–7, 4–6. Petrova ended 2003 ranked world No. 12, with a 45–23 singles record.

Petrova reached her second singles final at Gold Coast, losing once again to Sugiyama 6–1, 1–6, 4–6. Although seeded 10th at the 2004 Australian Open, she was upset in the first round by Anikó Kapros, losing 3–6, 3–6.

In March 2004, she entered the top 10 singles rankings, after reaching the semifinals of the Tier-1 Miami Open, climbing to No. 9 in the world. She reached the semifinals at Amelia Island, beating second-seeded Serena Williams, before losing to Lindsay Davenport. After this, her ranking elevated to a career high of No. 7. However, she failed to defend her semifinal points from the 2003 French Open, losing to Marlene Weingärtner in the third round, 3–6, 2–6. Petrova fared slightly better at Wimbledon, reaching the fourth round before losing to Capriati.

At the US Open, she pulled off the biggest win of her career by defeating world No. 1 and defending champion, Justine Henin-Hardenne, 6–3, 6–2 in the fourth round. It was Petrova&#x27;s first victory over a world No. 1. She lost in the quarterfinals to eventual champion Svetlana Kuznetsova, 6–7, 3–6.

Petrova reached the semifinals of Linz, losing to Elena Bovina in three sets, before reaching the semifinals of Philadelphia, losing to Vera Zvonareva. She finished the year ranked world No. 12 in singles (with a 40–25 record) but qualified for the WTA Championships in doubles for the first time with Meghann Shaughnessy after a season that saw the pair win six doubles titles (including three at Tier I level). The pair defeated the second seeds Kuznetsova and Elena Likhovtseva in the semifinals, then beat Cara Black and Rennae Stubbs to win the title, the biggest of Petrova&#x27;s career. As a result of her doubles success in 2004, she finished the year inside the top 10 for the first time at world No. 7.

===2005: Second French Open semifinal, first career singles title, and top 10 finish===
Petrova reached the fourth round of the Australian Open, losing to the eventual champion Serena Williams, in three sets. Over the next two months, her best result was a semifinal appearance at the Open Gaz de France. In doubles, she reached the final at Indian Wells with Meghan Shaughnessy, where they lost to Paola Suárez and Virginia Ruano Pascual. Following Indian Wells, Petrova rose to her career-high doubles ranking of No. 3 in the world.

After making the semifinals in Amelia Island and the quarterfinals in Charleston, Petrova reached her third career final (and first at Tier I level) at the German Open in May, beating Mary Pierce, Amélie Mauresmo and Jelena Janković, before losing to Justine Henin-Hardenne. This performance lifted her ranking to No. 9, starting a two-plus year period of continuously being ranked inside the top 10.

At the French Open, Petrova defeated 17-year-old Ana Ivanovic in the quarterfinals before losing to Henin-Hardenne 6–2, 6–3 in the semifinals; her performance at the tournament saw her ranking rise to world No. 8. She also reached the semifinals in doubles with Shaughnessy, but the pair would split shortly afterwards to Shaughnessy&#x27;s multiple injuries. A few weeks later at Wimbledon, she reached the quarterfinals before losing to defending champion Maria Sharapova, 6–7, 3–6. After Wimbledon, she was defeated in the quarterfinals of the next five tournaments she entered. This included the events in Los Angeles, Toronto, Luxembourg, and Filderstadt. Between Toronto and Luxembourg, Petrova also competed at the US Open, where she made her third consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinal. However, she was beaten by Sharapova (the new world No. 1) in straight sets for the second time in a row at Grand Slam level.

After losing the final in Bangkok to 16 year-old Nicole Vaidišová, Petrova finally won her first singles title on her fifth attempt at the Generali Ladies Linz (where she had reached her first ever WTA final in 2003) with a comeback three-set win over Patty Schnyder in the final. Her successful singles season meant she qualified for the WTA Championships in Los Angeles. She thrashed Maria Sharapova 6–1, 6–2, but lost here other two singles matches to Patty Schnyder and Lindsay Davenport meaning she exited at the round robin stage. She ended 2005 ranked world No. 9 (her first top-10 finish) and a 56-22 record, a career-high single season wins total.

===2006: Five singles titles, top 3 ranking in both singles and doubles===
At the Australian Open, Petrova was seeded sixth and defeated Sophie Ferguson, Martina Müller, Maria Elena Camerin, and Elena Vesnina on her way to her first quarterfinal at the Australian Open, the only major in which she had not yet advanced to that round. She lost to fourth-seeded Maria Sharapova, 6–7, 4–6 in the quarterfinals.

At the Qatar Ladies Open, Petrova picked up her first title of the year and second overall by beating second-ranked and top-seeded Amélie Mauresmo, 6–3, 7–5, in the final. The victory took her ranking to No. 7. She followed it with a quarterfinal showing at the Miami Open, losing to Mauresmo, 3–6, 1–6.

Petrova then began a run that would take her to three titles, winning fifteen straight matches. At Amelia Island, she defeated Francesca Schiavone in the final to pick up her third career title. One week later, she won her second consecutive title and the biggest of her career in Charleston with a victory over Patty Schnyder. This was Petrova&#x27;s first Tier I title.

She next entered the German Open in Berlin, defeating Justine Henin-Hardenne in three sets for her fifth career singles title, her third consecutive singles title, and her second consecutive Tier I title. With this win, Petrova extended her winning streak to a career-best 15 matches and ascended to her career-high singles ranking of world No. 3.

However, despite being one of the favorites for the French Open, Petrova suffered an ankle injury during training just days before the start of the tournament and was upset in the first round by Akiko Morigami, 2–6, 2–6. This marked the first time Petrova lost in the opening round of a major since the 2004 Australian Open – Women&#x27;s singles, snapping her 15-match winning streak, as well as her streak of four consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinals. Petrova&#x27;s injury forced her to later withdrew from Wimbledon. Her return a few weeks later went poorly as she did not win a match in the US Open Series, going 0–3. During this time, however, she won her first doubles title since the 2004 WTA Championships at the Tier I Canadian Open, alongside the great Martina Navratilova. More significantly, this was the 177th and final WTA Tour doubles of Navratilova&#x27;s career (an all-time record) before her permanent retirement at the end of the year. The US Open went poorly, however, as Petrova was upset in the third round by French teenager Tatiana Golovin.

After winning just one match in her next two tournaments, Petrova rebounded by winning the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix. She avenged her loss at the US Open to Golovin by beating the 18-year old in straight sets to earn her fifth title of the year and her first since the ankle injury. She then continued her return to form by reaching her seventh singles final of the year at the Kremlin Cup in Moscow, losing to compatriot Anna Chakvetadze.

At the WTA Championships in Madrid in November 2006, her lone victory was over top-ranked Amélie Mauresmo, 6–2, 6–2. She finished the year at No. 6 (her best ever year-end ranking) and a 48-19 match record.

===2007: Dip in form===
At the Australian Open, Petrova reached the third round, before falling to Serena Williams, the eventual champion, after holding a 5–3 lead in the second set.
At the Open Gaz de France in Paris, Petrova picked up her seventh career tour title and first of the season by beating Lucie Šafářová. Petrova reached the quarterfinals in Key Biscayne, losing to Justine Henin. Petrova then reached the final in Amelia Island where she was the defending champion, but lost to Golovin. After choosing not to compete in Charleston, Petrova failed to defend her title in Berlin, losing to Svetlana Kuznetsova in the quarterfinals, before retiring from her third-round match at the Italian Open due to low back pain.

She was the eleventh-seeded player at the French Open, but was upset by Květa Peschke, 5–7, 7–5, 0–6. After the loss, she claimed that the lower-back pain sustained in Rome had been bothering her. It was her second consecutive first-round loss at the French Open because of an injury. At Wimbledon, Petrova lost to 19 year-old Ana Ivanovic 1–6, 6–2, 4–6 in the fourth round.

In the 2007 Fed Cup tie against the U.S. team in July, Petrova played a pivotal role in securing the victory for her team. While losing on the first day against Venus Williams, she won her singles match against Meilen Tu on the second day, and then teamed with Elena Vesnina to beat Williams and Lisa Raymond in the decisive doubles rubber.

At the LA Championships, Petrova reached her third final of the year, losing to Ana Ivanovic in straight sets. At the US Open, Petrova was seeded seventh, but lost to Ágnes Szávay in the third round, 4–6, 4–6. The loss meant that she had not gone past the fourth round of any Grand Slam tournament all year, the first time since 2002.

She finished 2007 ranked No. 14, her lowest year-end ranking in five years.

===2008: Wimbledon quarterfinal, multiple titles===
Petrova started her 2008 season on a two-match losing streak going into the Australian Open, losing in the first round in Gold Coast as the second seed to Tathiana Garbin, 7–5, 5–7, 3–6, and in Sydney 5–7, 3–6 to Sybille Bammer. She still managed to reach the fourth round of the Australian Open though as the 14th seed with wins over Nicole Pratt, Anne Kremer, and Ekaterina Makarova, all in straight sets. There she played Agnieszka Radwańska, who beat her 6–1, 5–7, 0–6. Petrova held a 6–1, 3–0 lead and looked to be on her way to an easy victory. In the third set, she won just four points.

Petrova&#x27;s injuries continued to strike -when she was forced to retire in the second round of Miami with a right quad strain while trailing 1–2 in the first set against Zheng Jie.

At the German Open in Berlin, Petrova returned to action as the 16th seed and defeated Katarina Srebotnik in a three-setter the first round, before losing in the second to Maria Kirilenko, 3–6, 3–6. As a result, she dropped out of the top 20 for the first time since August 2003. Petrova was once again defeated by Kirilenko in the first round of Rome, but this time in three sets. At her final warm-up tournament in Istanbul, Nadia was seeded third and got past Lilia Osterloh in the first and Marta Domachowska in the second round. She lost to Akgul Amanmuradova in three sets in the quarterfinals.
These losses put Petrova in poor stead going into the French Open. As the 25th seed, she beat Aravane Rezaï and Alisa Kleybanova, in straight sets, before being thrashed by Kuznetsova in the third round, 6–2, 6–1.

Petrova&#x27;s grass-court season began at Eastbourne, where she reached her first final of the year showing good form. She was beaten in a close match by Agnieszka Radwańska, 6–4, 6–7, 6–4.

At Wimbledon, Petrova was 21st seed and was on track after wins over Olga Govortsova and Mara Santangelo. Petrova then pulled off an excellent win over the in-form teenager and 16th seed Victoria Azarenka in the third round. In the fourth round, she faced unseeded Alla Kudryavtseva who just came off a win over third seed Maria Sharapova; Petrova won to reach her second quarterfinal at Wimbledon, and her seventh at major level. This was also the first time that Petrova had reached a Grand Slam quarterfinal since the 2006 Australian Open. She lost a tough two and a half hour marathon match against the fifth seed Elena Dementieva, 1–6, 7–6, 3–6. Petrova rallied from 6–1, 5–2 down and saved match points throughout the second set, but eventually lost the match in the third set. Her ranking improved to world No. 17 after the tournament.

Bouncing back from a first-round defeat at Stanford to Dominika Cibulková, Petrova reached the quarterfinals at Los Angeles, defeating fifth seed Zvonareva en route, before losing to Janković, 5–7, 4–6. At Montreal, she again suffered a surprise defeat by Cibulková in the third round, this time losing 6–7, 2–6.

Nadia then played in Cincinnati, as she did not gain entry into the Beijing Olympics because she was not in the top-four ranked Russian players at the time. After easy wins over Galina Voskoboeva, Julie Ditty, and Lilia Osterloh, Petrova once again found herself up against Maria Kirilenko for a place in the final. This time though, Petrova was victorious, coming back from a set down to win, 1–6, 6–2, 6–1. Petrova then thrashed Nathalie Dechy, 6–2, 6–1, in the final to win her first singles title of the year, the eighth of her career, and her first since February 2007. She also won the doubles title in Cincinnati, partnering with Kirilenko, beating Hsieh Su-wei and Yaroslava Shvedova in the final in a third-set tiebreak. This marked Petrova&#x27;s 13th career doubles title and her first in two years.
Petrova was in good form heading into the final Grand Slam tournament of the year at the US Open, where she was seeded 19th. She handidly beat Olivia Sanchez in the first round and Hsieh Su-wei in the second but was ousted, 4–6, 6–4, 6–3, by the 16th seed Flavia Pennetta in the third round.

Petrova bounced back to good form at the Bali Tennis Classic. Seeded fourth, Nadia defeated fifth seed Francesca Schiavone in the quarterfinals, but she lost in the semifinals to second seed and eventual champion Patty Schnyder, 5–7, 1–6.

At the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, Petrova was unseeded, but beat two top–10 players, Ana Ivanovic, the second seed in the second round, and Agnieszka Radwańska to reach the semifinals, where she lost 1–6, 0–6 to Dinara Safina, the eventual champion. In the doubles tournament with Vania King, the duo managed to beat three out of the four seeded teams to win the title. Two weeks later in Stuttgart, she reached her third final of the season, after an impressive run, beating Barbora Záhlavová-Strýcová, Patty Schnyder, Li Na, and Victoria Azarenka in straight sets. She failed to win the title, this time losing to Jelena Janković, the world No. 2, 4–6, 3–6. Despite not winning the title, Petrova&#x27;s ranking moved back to world No. 14, as a result of reaching the final.

Petrova was a quarterfinalist at her home event, the Kremlin Cup in Moscow, beating teenager Caroline Wozniacki, before losing to compatriot and third seed Elena Dementieva, 4–6, 6–4, 6–7. However, she won the doubles title (her third of the season) with Katarina Srebotnik as the pair defeated the defending champions, Cara Black and Liezel Huber, in the final. She was also a quarterfinalist in Linz, losing 3–6, 2–6 to Radwańska.

At her final tournament of the season in Quebec City, Petrova won her second title of the year (and ninth of her career), beating lucky loser Angela Haynes in the semifinals and Bethanie Mattek-Sands, 4–6, 6–4, 6–1, in the final. This title also secured her status as the second alternate for the Tour Championships should a second player withdraw. This did indeed happen, and Petrova came in replacing Serena Williams, who pulled out after her second round-robin with a stomach injury. She lost her only match to Dementieva, 4–6, 6–4, 4–6.

Petrova finished the 2008 season ranked world No. 11 with a 47-24 match record.

===2009: Poor results===
Petrova started 2009 playing at the Sydney International, where she was seeded seventh. She lost in the first round to Alizé Cornet, 2–6, 4–6. Petrova was seeded tenth at the Australian Open in Melbourne. She lost to seventh–seeded Vera Zvonareva in the fourth round, 5–7, 4–6. Nevertheless, because of defending champion Maria Sharapova&#x27;s absence due to shoulder surgery and Ana Ivanovic&#x27;s third round loss, Petrova&#x27;s ranking moved back inside the top 10 for the first time since early 2007.

Petrova did not play in the Indian Wells, a Premier Mandatory event due to injury. In Miami, Nadia entered as ninth seed, but lost to world No. 54, Ekaterina Makarova, in the third round, 5–7, 1–6.

Petrova next headed to Ponte Vedra Beach as the top seed, where she defeated Olga Govortsova, Madison Keys (who had just won her first main-draw match), and Alona Bondarenko. She fell in the semifinals to eventual finalist Aleksandra Wozniak, 4–6, 6–4, 2–6. Petrova fell in the second round at Charleston to Melinda Czink, but won the doubles title partnering Bethanie Mattek-Sands. At the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix, Petrova was seeded sixth, but lost in the second round to Flavia Pennetta, 2–6, 2–6. Despite the poor singles result, she did well in doubles once more, winning the title with Mattek-Sands. She next went to the Rome Masters as eighth seed, where she had a first-round bye before defeating giant-killer Carla Suárez Navarro. In the third round, Petrova was ousted by María José Martínez Sánchez, 4–6, 7–6, 4–6.
Petrova&#x27;s next tournament was Wimbledon, the third Grand Slam of the year, where she was the tenth seed. She beat Anastasiya Yakimova in the first round. Petrova won her second-round match against Shahar Pe&#x27;er, and then came from a set down to beat Gisela Dulko. Petrova lost to Victoria Azarenka in three sets in the fourth round.

Petrova began her US Open Series campaign at Stanford, where she was seeded fifth. After defeating her doubles partner Bethanie Mattek-Sands in three sets in the first round, Petrova lost again to Sharapova, 1–6, 2–6, in just over an hour. In Los Angeles, she was also seeded fifth, but lost to tenth seed Flavia Pennetta, 3–6, 3–6, in the third round. Petrova then headed to Cincinnati, where she was the defending champion and the tenth seed. She was unable to defend her title, losing in the first round to Alona Bondarenko, 2–6, 3–6. This caused her ranking to slip out of the top 10 (where she had been since the end of the Australian Open) to world No. 12. Petrova next played in Toronto as the tenth seed, where her poor form continued as she fell again to Maria Sharapova in the first round. Continuing her campaign on the US Open Series, she then received a wildcard as the fourth seed at the New Haven, but again lost to compatriot Anna Chakvetadze in the first round.
Her next tournament was the final major of the year, the US Open. Petrova was the 13th seed and defeated Katarina Srebotnik and Julie Coin in the first and second round in straight sets. Petrova then got past world No. 22, Zheng Jie. Petrova was defeated in the fourth round by the 17 year-old unseeded American Melanie Oudin, 1–6, 7–6, 6–3. However, her ranking improved one spot to world No. 12.

Petrova then headed to Quebec to defend her title at the Bell Challenge. Petrova was the top seed and advanced to the quarterfinals with wins over Carly Gullickson and Madison Brengle in straight sets. Here, Petrova faced fifth seed Melinda Czink and was a set down when she was forced to retire due to a viral illness. Czink would go on to win the title. However, Nadia quickly returned to action in Tokyo as 13th seed, but continued a dismal season, losing in the second round to Magdaléna Rybáriková, 2–6, 2–6. She slipped to world No. 17 as a result of this bad form.
Nadia then participated at China Open, where she was 13th seed. She beat Alla Kudryavtseva in the first round and world No. 24, Daniela Hantuchová in the second round. She played one of her best matches in 2009 by beating Serena Williams in a thriller three-set match in the third round, despite the fact that Williams was just about to snitch back the world No. 1 ranking from Dinara Safina the following week. Petrova then survived another three-setter against Peng Shuai in the quarterfinals. This was only Petrova&#x27;s second semifinal of the year, but she lost to the reigning French Open Champion, Svetlana Kuznetsova, 1–6, 3–6.

Petrova then competed in the Kremlin Cup in both singles and doubles. Seeded fifth, she defeated Yana Buchina in the first round, but fell to Alona Bondarenko in the second round.

Petrova finished her poor year with a 30–21 singles record and ranked world No. 20. It was by far her worst year on tour as she captured no singles titles for the first time since 2004, and failed to reach at least one final for the first time since 2002. Her highlights of the year are reaching the semifinals in Ponte Vedra Beach and Beijing and reaching the quarterfinals in Quebec City.

===2010: Two major singles quarterfinals, first doubles Grand Slam final===

In the third round, she caused a huge upset by mothballing 15th seed Kim Clijsters 6–0, 6–1 in just 52 minutes. Clijsters, who had won the 2009 US Open in just her third tournament after coming back from retirement, was the bookmaker&#x27;s second favourite to win the tournament. Petrova followed that with another upset in the fourth round over third seed and 2009 French Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova. This was the second time in her career that she had reached the quarterfinals at the Australian Open. She fell to former world No. 1 and eventual runner-up Justine Henin (who had just come out of retirement herself), 6–7, 5–7, in a tight match after leading 3–0 in the second set.

After a first-round defeat to Stefanie Vögele in Dubai, Petrova next competed at the Premier Mandatory events in Indian Wells and Miami. Seeded 16th at Indian Wells and receiving a bye to the second round, she dispatched Patty Schnyder and then Peng Shuai, before losing in the fourth round to second seed Caroline Wozniacki.

The pair was able to reach the finals of both events, but could not come away with the elusive Sunshine Double, falling to Květa Peschke and Katarina Srebotnik at Indian Wells and Gisela Dulko and Flavia Pennetta in Miami. Nevertheless, these results brought Petrova back into the top 10 in doubles for the first time since August 2005.

Petrova began her clay-court season in Charleston and won her first two matches in straight sets against Vania King and Aleksandra Wozniak, before losing to Wozniacki in the quarterfinals.

In the third round, she fell a set behind against the in-form 15th seed and recent Madrid champion Aravane Rezaï, before coming back to take the second set. In the third set, Petrova saved three match points, as Rezaï served for the match at 5–4, before Petrova came back to serve for the match herself at 7–6. She too held three match points. Rezaï, however, broke back, and the match was postponed due to bad light. The match was completed the following day, when Petrova won, 6–7, 6–4, 10–8. She continued her success in the fourth round, where she stunned the world No. 2, Venus Williams, 6–4, 6–3, to advance to her ninth career major quarterfinal and her first at the French Open since 2005. Petrova led by a set in her quarterfinal match against fifth seed Elena Dementieva, but required treatment twice by the trainer during the match and limped to the finish line with Dementieva winning 2–6, 6–2, 6–0. Despite this loss, her quarterfinal run caused her ranking to improve to world No. 13. Playing doubles with Stosur, the fourth seeds retired in their third round match due to Petrova&#x27;s ailment.

Beginning the grass-court season in Eastbourne, Petrova was unseeded and came back from a set down to win in a final set tie-break against Karolina Šprem in the first round.

<text>A potter&#x27;s field, paupers&#x27; grave or common grave is a place for the burial of unknown, unclaimed or indigent people. &quot;Potter&#x27;s field&quot; is of Biblical origin, referring to Akeldama (meaning &quot;field of blood&quot; in Aramaic), stated to have been purchased after Judas Iscariot&#x27;s suicide by the chief priests of Jerusalem with the coins that had been paid to Judas for his identification of Jesus. The priests are stated to have acquired it for the burial of strangers, criminals, and the poor, the coins paid to Judas being considered blood money. Prior to Akeldama&#x27;s use as a burial ground, it had been a site where potters collected high-quality, deeply red clay for the production of ceramics, thus the name potters&#x27; field.
==Origin==

The term &quot;potter&#x27;s field&quot; comes from Matthew 27:3–27:8 in the New Testament of the Bible, in which Jewish priests take 30 pieces of silver returned by a remorseful Judas:

The site referred to in these verses is traditionally known as Akeldama, in the valley of Hinnom, which was a source of potters&#x27; clay. After the clay was removed, such a site would be left unusable for agriculture, being full of trenches and holes, thus becoming a graveyard for those who could not be buried in an orthodox cemetery.

The author of Matthew was drawing on earlier Biblical references to potters&#x27; fields. The passage continues, with verses 9 and 10:

This is based on a quotation from Zechariah (). However, Matthew attributes the quote to Jeremiah. The author of Matthew may have been mistaken. There are two other possible reasons for the reference. First, Jeremiah also speaks of buying a field, in . That field is a symbol of hope, not despair as mentioned in Matthew, and the price is 17 pieces of silver. The author of Matthew could have combined the words of Zechariah and Jeremiah, while only citing the &quot;major&quot; prophet. Secondly, &quot;Jeremiah&quot; was sometimes used to refer to the Books of the Prophets &quot;in toto&quot; as &quot;The Law&quot; is sometimes used to refer to Moses&#x27; five books – Genesis through Deuteronomy, the Pentateuch.

Craig Blomberg suggests that the use of the blood money to buy a burial ground for foreigners in Matthew 27:7 may hint at the idea that &quot;Jesus&#x27; death makes salvation possible for all the peoples of the world, including the Gentiles.&quot; Other scholars do not read the verse as referring to Gentiles, but rather to Jews who are not native to Jerusalem.

==Examples==
*Blue Plains, in the Anacostia area of Washington, D.C., contains remains of executed international spies including Nazi spies from Operation Pastorius.
*Eloise Cemetery in Westland, Michigan, was used by the Eloise hospital complex; some 7,000 people were buried there between 1894 and 1948.
*Golden Gate Cemetery in San Francisco, California, was used from 1870 to 1909, with some 29,000 burials in sections, one of which was a potter&#x27;s field.
*Hart Island in the Bronx is New York City&#x27;s current potter&#x27;s field and one of the largest cemeteries in the United States with at least 800,000 burials.
*Holt Cemetery in New Orleans contains the remains of known and unknown early jazz musicians, including Charles &quot;Buddy&quot; Bolden. The battered remains of Robert Charles, at the center of the 1900 New Orleans race riot were briefly interred there, then dug up and incinerated.
*Hudson County Burial Grounds in Secaucus, New Jersey.
*Kings County Cemetery or Kings County Farm Cemetery, Brooklyn, New York City.
*Lincoln Park, on Chicago&#x27;s North Side, found its origin in the 1840s as Chicago City Cemetery. The southernmost portion of the cemetery, where one may now find a number of baseball fields (north of LaSalle Dr., west of North Avenue Beach), was the location of the City Cemetery potter&#x27;s field from 1843 to 1871. More than 15,000 people, including 4,000 Confederate soldiers, were buried here on marshy land near the water&#x27;s edge. The baseball fields have occupied these grounds since 1877.
*Madison Square Park, Washington Square Park and Bryant Park in New York City originated as potter&#x27;s fields.
*Music Hall in Cincinnati, Ohio was built over a 19th-century potter&#x27;s field.
*Potter&#x27;s Field (Omaha) in Omaha, Nebraska
*Queen Lane Apartments. Work on the project was delayed by the discovery of a potter&#x27;s field on an adjacent plot.
*Shockoe Hill African Burying Ground in Richmond, Virginia, came to be labeled as Potter&#x27;s Field on maps in the 1870s. It was/is likely the largest burial ground for free people of color and the enslaved in the United States. The number of estimated interments made between 1816 and 1879 is upwards of 22,000.
*Strangers&#x27; Burying Ground, Toronto open from 1826 to 1855 with total 6,685 burials.
*Washington Park (Albany) was the site of the State Street Burying Grounds, a municipal cemetery which included a potter&#x27;s field. Some maps identify the section as the &quot;strangers&quot; burial ground.

<text>Ruth Elke Lawrence-Neimark (, born 2 August 1971) is a British–Israeli mathematician and a professor of mathematics at the Einstein Institute of Mathematics, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and a researcher in knot theory and algebraic topology. In the public eye, she is best known for having been a child prodigy in mathematics.

==Early life==
Ruth Lawrence was born in Brighton, England. Her parents, Harry Lawrence and Sylvia Greybourne, were both computer consultants. When Lawrence was five, her father gave up his job so that he could educate her at home. She is Jewish. 

==Education==
At the age of nine, Lawrence gained an O-level in mathematics, setting a new age record (later surpassed in 2001 when Arran Fernandez successfully sat GCSE mathematics aged five). Also at the age of nine she achieved a Grade A at A-level pure mathematics.

In 1981 Lawrence passed the Oxford University entrance examination in mathematics, joining St Hugh&#x27;s College in 1983 at the age of 12.

At Oxford, her father continued to be actively involved in her education, accompanying her to all lectures and some tutorials. Lawrence completed her bachelor&#x27;s degree in two years, instead of the normal three, and graduated in 1985 at the age of 13 with a congratulatory first and special commendation. Attracting considerable press interest, she became the youngest British person to gain a first-class degree, and the youngest to graduate from the University of Oxford in modern times.

Lawrence followed her first degree with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in physics in 1986 and a Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil) degree in mathematics at Oxford in June 1989, at the age of 17. Her doctoral thesis title was &quot;Homology representations of braid groups&quot; and her thesis adviser was Sir Michael Atiyah.

==Academic career==
Lawrence and her father moved to America for Lawrence&#x27;s first academic post, which was at Harvard University, where she became a junior fellow in 1990 at the age of 19. In 1993, she moved to the University of Michigan, where she became an associate professor with tenure in 1997.

In 1998, Lawrence married Ariyeh Neimark, a mathematician at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and adopted the name Ruth Lawrence-Neimark. The following year, she moved to Israel with him and took up the post of associate professor of mathematics at the Einstein Institute of Mathematics, a part of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

==Research==
Lawrence&#x27;s 1990 paper &quot;Homological representations of the Hecke algebra&quot;, in &quot;Communications in Mathematical Physics&quot;, introduced, among other things, certain novel linear representations of the braid group — known as Lawrence–Krammer representations. In papers published in 2000 and 2001, Daan Krammer and Stephen Bigelow established the faithfulness of Lawrence&#x27;s representation. This result goes by the phrase &quot;braid groups are linear.&quot;

==Awards and honors==
In 2012 she became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.

<text>The University of Rostock () is a public university located in Rostock, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany. Founded in 1419, it is the third-oldest university in Germany. It is the oldest university in continental northern Europe and the Baltic Sea area, and 8th oldest in Central Europe. It was the 5th university established in the Holy Roman Empire.

The university has been associated with three Nobel laureates: Albrecht Kossel, Karl von Frisch and Otto Stern. It is a member of the European University Association. According to a ranking published by &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; in 2018, it is the most beautiful university in Germany and the fourth most beautiful university in all of Europe. The language of instruction is usually German and English for some postgraduate studies.


==History==
===1419–1919===
The university was founded in 1419 by confirmation of Pope Martin V and thus is one of the oldest universities in Northern Europe.

In Germany, there are only five universities that were founded earlier, while only Heidelberg and Leipzig operated continuously since then: Heidelberg (1386), Cologne (1388/1919), Erfurt (1392/1994), Würzburg (1402/1582) and Leipzig (1409).
That makes Rostock University the third oldest German university in continuous operation.

Throughout the 15th and 16th centuries, the University of Rostock had about 400 to 500 students each year and was among the most important universities in Germany and Northern Europe at the time, with many of its students originating from the Low Countries, Scandinavia or other countries bordering the Baltic Sea.

In the course of political struggles and due to pressure from the church, the university moved to Greifswald in 1437 and remained there until 1443. From 1487 to 1488 teaching took place in Lübeck. A few years after the city of Rostock, the university became Protestant in 1542. Henceforth, Humanism and Lutheranism were defining characteristics of the university.

In the 16th century, Rostock was the first university to teach Copernicanism, which was introduced by Professor Duncan Liddel. After the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648), however, for about two centuries the University of Rostock played only a regional role. After the &quot;ownership&quot; of the university had moved from the city to the state (Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin) in 1827, however, things changed for the better. The second half of the 19th century saw generous building activity in Rostock&#x27;s &quot;alma mater&quot; and the university soon regained its old reputation amongst German universities.

===1919 to present===

On the occasion of the 500th anniversary of the university, Albert Einstein and Max Planck received honorary doctorates on 12 November 1919. This made the University of Rostock the world&#x27;s first institute of higher learning to award this honour to Einstein. The doctorate was not revoked during the Nazi rule in Germany (1933–1945), despite such orders by the Nazis. The reason for this remains unknown. Psychologist David Katz and professor of dentistry and dean of the medical faculty lost their posts in 1933 among others.

The end of the Second World War in 1945 brought many changes. The university, now finding itself in the Soviet Zone of Germany (the later German Democratic Republic), was re-opened on 24 February 1946. The Faculty of Law was closed in 1951, a Faculty of Agriculture was introduced in 1950 and in 1951 saw the opening of a Department of Shipbuilding (renamed Faculty of Technology in 1963). The University of Rostock was the first traditional university in Germany to open a technical faculty. In 1952, the Faculty of Aviation was opened, but eventually relocated to Dresden.

In 1976 the university was renamed Wilhelm-Pieck-Universität after Wilhelm Pieck, the first president of the German Democratic Republic. The renaming was annulled after the German reunification.

External funding increased by 83 % between 2005 and 2010 alone and currently is above 65 million euros per year. Over 500 million Euros have been invested in the university infrastructure since 1991, reaching 750 million euros by 2015. The numbers of young people from Germany and of international students who choose Rostock as a place to study are increasing every year. As of today [when?], students from at least 99 different countries have studied at Rostock. In 2007, the University of Rostock reorganized its research capacities into three profile lines: &quot;Life, Light &amp; Matter&quot;, &quot;Maritime Systems&quot;, and &quot;Aging of Individuals and Societies&quot;. In 2010, a fourth profile was added, called &quot;Knowledge – Culture – Transformation&quot;.

==Organization and structure==

<text>The Fourth Brazilian Republic, also known as the &quot;Populist Republic&quot; or as the &quot;Republic of 46&quot;, is the period of Brazilian history between 1946 and 1964. It was marked by political instability and the military&#x27;s pressure on civilian politicians which ended with the 1964 Brazilian coup d&#x27;état and the establishment of the Brazilian military dictatorship.

This period was marked by often tumultuous presidencies of Eurico Gaspar Dutra, Getúlio Vargas, Café Filho, Juscelino Kubitschek, Jânio Quadros and João Goulart. In 1945, president Getúlio Vargas was deposed by a bloodless military coup, but his influence in Brazilian politics remained until the end of the Fourth Republic. During this period, three parties dominated national politics. Two of them were pro-Vargas — the Brazilian Labour Party (&quot;Partido Trabalhista Brasileiro&quot;, PTB) to the left and the Social Democratic Party (&quot;Partido Social Democrático&quot;, PSD) in the center — and another anti-Vargas party, the rightist National Democratic Union (&quot;União Democrática Nacional&quot;, UDN).

==End of the Estado Novo, 1945==
As the Second World War ended with Brazil participating on the Allied side, then president Getúlio Vargas moved to liberalize his own fascist-influenced &quot;Estado Novo&quot; regime. Vargas decreed an amnesty to political prisoners, including the chief of the Communist Party, Luís Carlos Prestes.

He also introduced an electoral law and allowed political parties to campaign. Three political parties introduced themselves into the national political scene. The liberal and rightist parties of the opposition against Vargas created the National Democratic Union. The bureaucrats and supporters of the &quot;Estado Novo&quot; grouped in the Brazilian Social Democratic Party. Vargas also created the Brazilian Labour Party, to the left, to group the workers&#x27; and the laborers&#x27; unions. The Brazilian Communist Party, weakened during the dictatorship, was also legalised.

The &quot;Estado Novo&quot; ended when two of his most rightist supporters, the Minister of War Eurico Gaspar Dutra, and Army Chief-of-Staff Pedro Aurélio de Góis Monteiro led a military coup on 29 October 1945. The president of the Supreme Federal Court, José Linhares, was inaugurated as president of Brazil. Linhares guaranteed free and regular elections and Vargas was forced into retirement. General Eurico Gaspar Dutra was elected president.

==Dutra, 1946–1951==

On 18 September 1946, the fifth constitution of Brazil was adopted, marking the country&#x27;s return to democratic rule. That same year, the government created the Social Service of Industry (SESI) and Social Service of Commerce (SESC), and the General Staff, the future General Staff of the Armed Forces (EMFA). 
In 1946, Dutra ordered the closing of casinos and prohibited &quot;gambling&quot; in the country. In 1947, he appointed Osvaldo Aranha as representative of Brazil to the United Nations, outlawed the Brazilian Communist Party, ended diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and organized the Inter-American Conference of Peacekeeping and Security of the Continent in Petrópolis, which was attended by U.S. president Harry Truman. In October 1948, his government set up the Superior School of War (ESG), with American support. Closer relations with the United States were displayed by the formation of the Joint Commission of Brazil-United States, known as Abbink Mission, headed by John Abbink and Minister Octavio Gouveia de Bouillon.

The development strategy of the government included the &quot;Salte Plan&quot;, which put emphasis on health, food, transportation and energy. Proposed in 1947, the plan aimed at better management of public spending and investment in key sectors in the country but only began to receive funding from the budget in 1949, being forgotten in 1951. During this period, measurements of the country&#x27;s economic growth by calculating the Gross Domestic Product were first regularly published. The average annual growth of the Brazilian economy during the Dutra administration was 7.6%.

On 6 August 1947 the Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB) was founded, but remained minor at the time.

In 1950, Brazil hosted 1950 FIFA World Cup for which the famous Maracanã Stadium was built.

During the Dutra government, construction of the hydroelectric plant of Paulo Afonso, in Bahia, and the Presidente Dutra highway, linking Rio to São Paulo, was initiated.

==Vargas, 1951–1954==

In 1950, Vargas was elected president and returned to national politics. The Vargas administration was hampered by an economic crisis, congressional opposition, and impatience among his supporters. He announced an ambitious industrialization plan and pursued a policy of nationalization of the country&#x27;s natural resources. To reduce foreign dependency, he founded Petrobras, the Brazilian state oil enterprise.

By 1954, Vargas faced opposition from the UDN and the military. The murder of major Rubens Vaz, an associate of opposition newspaper editor Carlos Lacerda, by some of the president&#x27;s bodyguards, known as the crime of &quot;Rua Tonelero&quot;, led to a reaction against Vargas. Army generals demanded his resignation.

After failing to negotiate a temporary leave of absence, Vargas declared &quot;he would only leave the Catete (Presidential Palace) dead&quot;. Acknowledging that the chances that a democratic government would succeed him were none, and that another military coup was coming, with probably worse results than 1950s one, Vargas kept his word and shot himself in the heart on 24 August 1954, after writing a letter blaming &quot;international groups&quot; and &quot;revolted national groups&quot; for the current situation. The results were immediate: opposition newspapers were closed, the people took to the streets and in a last shown of political force and popularity, Vargas postponed the military dictatorship by 10 years.

===Collapse of Brazilian populism===
Vargas&#x27; ever-shifting populist dictatorship helped to rein in the agrarian oligarchs, paving the way for the democratization of the 1950s and 1960s which was ended by the right-wing 1964 military coup. But the state still maintained a loose variation of Getúlio Vargas&#x27; populism and economic nationalism. Between 1930 and 1964, as Brazilian populism itself guided changes in the structure of Brazil&#x27;s economy (Vargas&#x27; policies promoted industrial growth), Vargas and his successors were forced to shift the makeup of particular kinds of class alliances reconciled by the state.

After Vargas&#x27; suicide in 1954, awaiting a seemingly inevitable military coup, the support base for Brazilian populism began to deteriorate. Vargas&#x27; first ouster from 1945–1951 and his suicide demonstrated that Brazilian populism had been deteriorating for some time. Brazilian populism lingered for another decade but in new forms. If corporatism was the hallmark of the 1930s and 1940s, nationalism and developmentalism characterized the 1950s and early 1960s. Each of these contributed to the crisis that gripped Brazil and resulted in the authoritarian regime after 1964.

Thus, as the historical context shifted, so did the ideology of Brazilian populism. Between 1934 and 1945, Brazilian populism was a reactionary phenomenon, exhibiting parallels to European fascism. In contrast, under the presidency of João Goulart (1961–64) — a protégé of Getúlio Vargas and another &quot;gaúcho&quot; from Rio Grande do Sul, the closeness of the government to the historically disenfranchised working class and peasantry and even to the Communist Party led by Luís Carlos Prestes was remarkable. 

Goulart appeared to have been co-opting the Communist movement in a manner reminiscent of Vargas&#x27; co-optation of the Integralists shortly — and not coincidentally — before his ouster by reactionary forces. Eventually, the 1964 junta and the ensuing military dictatorship proved that the establishment forces that ushered Goulart&#x27;s mentor into power in the first place, and the bourgeoisie that Vargas helped rear found the left-leaning turn of Brazilian populism intolerable.

==Interim Presidents, 1954–1956==
After the suicide of Vargas, Vice President Café Filho assumed the Presidency of the Republic from August 24, 1954 until November 8, 1955 when, due to illness, he transferred his powers to the President of the Chamber of Deputies. Acting President Carlos Luz (November 8 - 11) was quickly removed by the National Congress under pressure of the Minister of the Army. Vice President of the Federal Senate Nereu Ramos took over as Interim President until 31 January 1956, when President-elect Juscelino Kubitschek was inaugurated.

==Kubitschek, 1956–1961==


Kubitschek&#x27;s presidency was marked by a time of political optimism. Campaigning on a platform of &quot;fifty years [of progress] in five&quot; he presented a plan of national development that had 31 goals distributed in six large groups: energy, transport, food, base industries, education and the main goal: the construction of new capital city Brasília. This plan sought to stimulate the diversification and expansion of the Brazilian economy, based on industrial growth and closer integration of the country&#x27;s territory. Kubitschek promoted the development of the automobile industry, naval industry, heavy industry, and the construction of hydro-electric power plants. With the exception of the hydro-electric industry, Kubitschek practically created an economy without state-owned companies.

Kubitschek sought to achieve this progress with the aid of foreign investment, which in turn would be given generous incentives, such as profit remittances, low taxes, privileges for the importation of machinery, and land donations. However, the exemption was made only if the foreign capital was associated with the national capital (&quot;associated capital&quot;). This influx of foreign capital threatened domestic industry, which was unable to compete with efficiency and expertise of foreign companies. Domestic manufacturers, once the core base of support for economic nationalism, become managers or partners of the multinational companies. The urban bourgeoisie — the original base of Vargas&#x27; coalition — had little use for Brazilian populism any more, having outgrown state planning phase.

In 1958, Brazil won the 1958 FIFA World Cup.

By the end of his term, the foreign debt had grown from 87 million dollars to 297 million dollars. The inflation and wealth inequality had grown larger, with the occurrence of rural-zone strikes that expanded to the urban areas.

==Quadros, 1961==
Jânio Quadros was elected president of Brazil by a landslide in 1960, running as the candidate of the National Labor Party (PTN). When Quadros took office, on 31 January 1961, it was the first time since Brazil became a republic in 1889 that an incumbent government peacefully transferred power to an elected member of the opposition. It was also the first time in 31 years that the presidency was not held by an heir to the legacy of Getúlio Vargas.

Quadros laid the blame for the country&#x27;s high rate of inflation on his predecessor, Juscelino Kubitschek. As president, Quadros outlawed gambling, banned women from wearing bikinis on the beach, and established relations with the Soviet Union and Cuba, trying to achieve a neutralist international policy. The re-establishment of relations with the Socialist Bloc in the middle of the Cold War cost him the support of the UDN in Congress, so he was left with no real power.

===Resignation crisis===
Quadros resigned on 25 August 1961, citing foreign and &quot;terrible forces&quot; in his resignation letter. His resignation is commonly thought to have been a move to increase his own power, as he expected to return to the presidency by the acclamation of the Brazilian people or by the request of the National Congress of Brazil and the military. This maneuver, however, was immediately rejected by Congress, which accepted his resignation and called on the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Pascoal Ranieri Mazzilli, to assume office until the vice president, João Goulart, came back from his trip to Communist China.

==Goulart, 1961–1964==

Goulart faced strong opposition from conservative politicians and military officers in his bid to assume the presidency, triggering the Legality Campaign. The crisis was solved by the &quot;parliamentarian solution&quot; – an arrangement that decreased his powers as president by creating a new post of Prime Minister, which was filled by Tancredo Neves, and instituting a Parliamentary republic. Goulart finally assumed office on 7 September 1961.

Brazil returned to a presidential government in 1963 after a referendum and, as Goulart&#x27;s powers grew, it became evident that he would seek to implement his &quot;base reforms&quot;, such as land reform and nationalization of enterprises in various economic sectors, regardless of assent from established institutions such as Congress. Goulart had low parliamentarian support, due to the fact that his centrist attempts to win support from both sides of the spectrum gradually came to alienate both.

On 1 April 1964, after a night of conspiracy, rebel troops made their way to Rio de Janeiro, considered a loyalist bastion. São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s generals were convinced to join the coup. To prevent a civil war, and knowing that the U.S. would openly support the army, Goulart fled first to Rio Grande do Sul, and then went into exile in Uruguay.

<text>Pierre Antoine Delalande (27 March 1787 – 27 June 1823) was a French naturalist, taxidermist, explorer and painter.

==Life==
Pierre Antoine Delalande was the son of a taxidermist in the National Museum of Natural History in Paris. He was employed at the museum from a young age, where he became an assistant of the naturalist Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. He took painting classes from the Flemish animal painter Jean-Baptiste Berré, who was an official painter at the Jardin des Plantes and exhibited landscapes and animal paintings in the Salons of Paris.

Delalande was employed by the National Museum of Natural History to collect natural history specimens. He accompanied the botanist Augustin Saint-Hilaire in 1808 on a zoological collecting trip to Portugal, and was sent to the coast of Provence in 1813 to collect fishes and molluscs. He traveled to Brazil in 1816 to collect specimens for the museum.

In 1818 he began an expedition to South Africa with his nephew Jules Verreaux, who was around 12 years old at the time, to collect specimens. Delalande and Verreaux travelled and collected in South Africa for three years. On their return in 1821, they took back an astounding 131,405 specimens, mostly plant material. Their collection included 288 mammals, 2205 birds, 322 reptiles, 265 fish, 3875 shellfish, and various human skulls and skeletons from a Cape Town cemetery and from the 22 April 1819 Battle of Grahamstown between the British forces under Colonel Willshire and the Xhosa under Nxele.

He is honoured in the specific names of the butterfly, &quot;Papilio delalandei&quot; ; the birds, &quot;Corythopis delalandi&quot;, &quot;Coua delalandei&quot;, and &quot;Stephanoxis lalandi&quot; ; the frog, &quot;Tomopterna delalandii&quot; ; the lizards, &quot;Chioninia delalandii&quot;, &quot;Nucras lalandii&quot;, and &quot;Tarentola delalandii&quot; ; and the blindsnake, &quot;Rhinotyphlops lalandei&quot;.

<text>Love Me Tender is a 1956 American musical Western film directed by Robert D. Webb, and released by 20th Century Fox on November 15, 1956. The film, named after the song, stars Richard Egan, Debra Paget, and Elvis Presley in his acting debut. It was the only time in his acting career that he did not receive top billing.

&quot;Love Me Tender&quot; was originally to be titled &quot;The Reno Brothers&quot;, but when advanced sales of Presley&#x27;s &quot;Love Me Tender&quot; single passed one million—a first for a single—the film&#x27;s title was changed to match. 
&quot;Love Me Tender&quot; was the first of three films in which he played an historical figure. The others were &quot;Frankie &amp; Johnny&quot; (which takes place in the 1890s) and &quot;The Trouble With Girls&quot; (which takes place in 1927).

==Plot==
Presley plays Clint Reno, the youngest of the four Reno brothers, who stays home to take care of his mother and the family farm as older brothers Vance, Brett and Ray fight in the American Civil War for the Confederate Army. The family is mistakenly informed that eldest brother Vance has been killed on the battlefield. After four years of war, the brothers return home and find that Vance&#x27;s former girlfriend Cathy has married Clint. Although Vance accepts this wholeheartedly, the family has to struggle to reach stability with this issue. It is clear from the outset upon the Reno brothers&#x27; return home that Cathy still loves Vance, although she is true to the younger Clint. Honor prevails for Vance, but jealousy leads Clint into irrational rivalry for Cathy&#x27;s love.

In the film&#x27;s opening scenes, the three Reno brothers, serving as Confederate cavalrymen, attack a Union train carrying a federal payroll of $12,000, not knowing that the war had ended only a day before. The Confederates come to a decision to keep the money as spoils of war. A conflict of interest ensues when Vance tries to return the money against the wishes of some of his fellow Confederates, all of whom are being sought by the U.S. Government for robbery. The film reaches its tragic climax with Clint&#x27;s death during a final shootout. In the end, the money is returned, the Reno brothers are released, the other three ex-Confederates are arrested, and Clint is laid to rest at the family farm.

==Production==
===Development===
The film was originally called &quot;The Reno Brothers&quot; based on a story by Maurice Geraghty. Fox bought the screen rights in August 1952 and assigned Robert L. Jacks to produce.

The film was not put into production immediately. A somewhat more realistic film telling the story of the Reno Brothers, &quot;Rage at Dawn&quot; starring Randolph Scott, had been released by RKO Radio Pictures in 1955.

Robert Buckner wrote a script and David Weisbart became a producer with Robert D. Webb to direct. In August 1956, Richard Egan signed to play the lead. Debra Paget was also signed before Presley.

Producer Weisbert said &quot;we signed Elvis later for the younger brother (at $100,000) when we heard he was available.&quot;

====Casting Presley====

Presley had shown interest in becoming an actor before achieving major success as a singer. His first No. 1 hit single, &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;, topped &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top 100 chart in April 1956, a few weeks after his screen test for this film. He had worked as a cinema usher in his youth and would often watch his screen idols James Dean, Marlon Brando, and Tony Curtis during shifts, studying their acting and learning lines from their movies. When he first met his future manager, Colonel Tom Parker, he expressed an interest in acting in film.

In interviews during his rise to fame, Presley would often talk about his hopes of attending somewhere like the Actors Studio. He also insisted that he would not like to sing in any of his movies because he wished to be taken seriously as a film star. However, Parker had a plan to cross-promote Presley&#x27;s films with his music and this led to soundtracks being as important, if not moreso, than the scripts.

Presley screen-tested for Hal Wallis on March 26, 1956 at Paramount Studios. The test lasted three days and included Presley performing two scenes from &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;, and lip-syncing to &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot;.

Wallis&#x27; partner, Joe Hazen, commented: &quot;As a straight actor, the guy has great potentialities.&quot; His first screen test, a scene from the William Inge play &quot;The Girls of Summer&quot;, resulted in drama coach Charlotte Clary declaring to her class of students, &quot;Now &quot;that&quot; is a natural born actor&quot;.

On April 2, Wallis offered Presley a contract for one motion picture, with options on six more. The contract was finalized on April 25, and also stipulated that Presley was free to make at least one picture a year for other studios.

Wallis, who had produced classics such as &quot;Casablanca&quot;, &quot;Little Caesar&quot;, and &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, had promised Presley that he would look for dramatic roles to let the singer take his acting career seriously.

Wallis considered Presley for a role in &quot;The Rat Race&quot;, a film about a &quot;naive, innocent boy&quot; who was struggling to make it as a musician in Manhattan, but he decided against it after another studio executive said, &quot;Elvis Presley just doesn&#x27;t look like that&quot;. The film was eventually made in 1960 with Tony Curtis in the lead role. Another possibility Wallis mulled over was to pair Presley with Jerry Lewis. Lewis had just separated from his comedy partner Dean Martin after a successful run of seventeen movies together, but again the idea was shelved.

On April 10, Presley confidently announced during a radio interview that his debut feature would be &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; with Burt Lancaster and Katharine Hepburn. However, despite this belief, and due to Wallis being unable to find a project &quot;good enough for the debut of Elvis Presley&quot;, he was loaned out to &quot;20th Century Fox&quot; on August 13 and began work on &quot;Love Me Tender&quot; on August 22.

Presley&#x27;s role had originally been turned down by both Jeffrey Hunter and Robert Wagner because the part was too small. According to Presley&#x27;s then girlfriend, June Juanico, he was reluctant to take the role after realizing that his character died at the end, but he was persuaded to do it after she told him that the characters audiences were most likely to remember were the ones who had a tragic fate.

By August 17 Fox announced the four brothers would be played by James Drury, Cameron Mitchell, Presley and Egan. The &quot;New York Times&quot; called Presley&#x27;s casting &quot;somewhere between fantasy and drama&quot; and said his next film would be for Paramount, &quot;The Lonesome Cowboy&quot;. William Campbell played another brother. Cameron Mitchell eventually turned down his role and was replaced by Neville Brand.

The moment Presley&#x27;s casting was announced, Fox was deluged with queries about the film from Presley&#x27;s fans. It was decided to expand his part and give him some songs to sing.

===Filming===
Presley arrived for filming with all of his lines learned, as well as the lines for all the other parts. He found filming quite taxing, once commenting to a friend that he had spent a whole day &quot;behind a team of mules&quot;. In little more than a month Presley had recorded all the songs for the film and had finished filming his scenes.

Filming of the movie&#x27;s climactic sequence, including the death scene for Presley&#x27;s character, took place at the Bell Moving Picture Ranch in the Santa Susana Mountains west of the San Fernando Valley on the outskirts of Los Angeles. The exact filming location, sometimes referred to among historians as the &quot;Rocky Hill&quot;, remained elusive for almost 60 years, until the site was discovered on an expedition by filming location researchers in early 2015. The party was able to locate the site by combining details from &quot;Love Me Tender&quot; and the Victor Mature movie &quot;Escort West&quot;, which also filmed on the &quot;Rocky Hill.&quot;

Weibsart said during the shoot Presley was &quot;humble, polite, solicitous... He was co operative with us, never late, and very serious about acting. This was another kind of career for him.&quot;

When Presley appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; during a break in filming the movie, on September 9, he performed &quot;Love Me Tender&quot; for the first time. Two weeks later RCA confirmed that advanced sales of the single had resulted in it going Gold before even being released—an industry first. (It sold one million copies pre ordered and ultimately ended up selling two million copies.)

On 2 September, Fox announced the film&#x27;s title would be changed from &quot;The Reno Brothers&quot; to &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;.

&quot;I think he provides tremendous additional value in the role&quot;, said Weisbart. &quot;He will surprise a lot of people who go to see him because his presence is just a gimmick. Actually he plays an acting part in a legitimate story and he does it very well. He sings but the script is so constructed that the situations are logical... when the family is together after the war... [or] at a bazar and picnic. These are folk tunes or hoedowns that – except for the title piece, a ballad – have Elvis&#x27; rhythms. With his long brown hair and sideburns he looks legitimate too in terms of the period.&quot;

===Previews and reshoots===
Test screenings of the film resulted in people being upset at the death of Presley&#x27;s character. Attempting to reach a compromise between the death and pleasing his fans, Presley filmed an extra scene and recorded an extra verse to the title track to be played over the end credits.

==Release==
&quot;Love Me Tender&quot; premiered on November 15, 1956, at the Paramount Theatre in New York City, and was released nationally on November 21. Though studios typically released were only 200-300 prints, 20th Century Fox released a record-breaking 575 prints. On November 20 Presley attended a private screening at Loew&#x27;s State Theater in Memphis, during which his mother, Gladys, cried over the death of her son&#x27;s character. Presley responded by insisting that his characters never die on screen again.

===Box office===
The film grossed $540,000 in its first week of release, claiming the No. 2 at the box office and earning back the money it cost the studio to produce it. &quot;Giant&quot;, starring James Dean, earned the No. 1 spot.
Within weeks &quot;Love Me Tender&quot; had recouped the costs of the negatives and, despite being released in November, was the 23rd highest-grossing film of the year.

===Critical reception===
Many critics gave the film a lukewarm reception, though some viewed it in a positive light. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Elvis can act. S&#x27;help me the boy&#x27;s real good, even when he isn&#x27;t singing.&quot;

Presley would later express regret at making the film and disappointment that the additions of songs helped shape his Hollywood career.

In his book &quot;Me And A Guy Named Elvis&quot;, Jerry Schilling recounts the atmosphere inside Loew&#x27;s State Theater in Memphis during the premiere screening: &quot;The screams of the girls around me made it just about impossible to follow the story. This was the first time I&#x27;d seen an audience treat a film like it was a live concert, loudly responding to every move made and word uttered by their favorite star.&quot;

Presley would later tell his friend that he found this type of reaction from his moviegoing fans embarrassing, and that it prevented him from being viewed as a serious actor.

==Soundtrack==

The movie has four Elvis Presley songs: &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;, &quot;Let Me&quot;, &quot;Poor Boy&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;re Gonna Move.&quot;

==Home media==
The film was released on videocassette by Key Video in February 1985 as part of the release of 11 videos to mark the 50th anniversary of Presley&#x27;s birth. In the summer of 2006, the film was released on DVD in a special 50th anniversary issue. It was featured in a slipcase, and included a set of 4 lobby card reproductions. The disc contains the movie in its original widescreen letterbox format, plus audio commentary by noted Elvis historian, and Memphis Mafia member, Jerry Schilling. The disc includes three featurettes: &quot;Elvis Hits Hollywood&quot;, &quot;The Colonel &amp; The King&quot;, and &quot;Love Me Tender: The Birth &amp; Boom of the Elvis Hit&quot;. Also part of the disc are original trailers for &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;, &quot;Flaming Star&quot; and &quot;Wild in the Country&quot;.

<text>Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) is a continuously updated catalog of human genes and genetic disorders and traits, with a particular focus on the gene-phenotype relationship. , approximately 9,000 of the over 25,000 entries in OMIM represented phenotypes; the rest represented genes, many of which were related to known phenotypes.

== Versions and history ==
OMIM is the online continuation of Victor A. McKusick&#x27;s &quot;Mendelian Inheritance in Man&quot; (MIM), which was published in 12 editions between 1966 and 1998. Nearly all of the 1,486 entries in the first edition of MIM discussed phenotypes.

MIM/OMIM is produced and curated at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine (JHUSOM). OMIM became available on the internet in 1987 under the direction of the Welch Medical Library at JHUSOM with financial support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. From 1995 to 2010, OMIM was available on the World Wide Web with informatics and financial support from the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The current OMIM website (OMIM.org), which was developed with funding from JHUSOM, is maintained by Johns Hopkins University with financial support from the National Human Genome Research Institute.

== Collection process and use ==
The content of MIM/OMIM is based on selection and review of the published peer-reviewed biomedical literature. Updating of content is performed by a team of science writers and curators under the direction of Ada Hamosh at the McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine of Johns Hopkins University. While OMIM is freely available to the public, it is designed for use primarily by physicians and other health care professionals concerned with genetic disorders, by genetics researchers, and by advanced students in science and medicine.

The database may be used as a resource for locating literature relevant to inherited conditions, and its numbering system is widely used in the medical literature to provide a unified index for genetic diseases.

== OMIM classification system ==
=== OMIM numbers ===

Each OMIM entry is given a unique six-digit identifier as summarized below:
* 100000–299999: Autosomal loci or phenotypes (entries created before May 15, 1994)
* 300000–399999: X-linked loci or phenotypes
* 400000–499999: Y-linked loci or phenotypes
* 500000–599999: Mitochondrial loci or phenotypes
* 600000 and above: Autosomal loci or phenotypes (entries created after May 15, 1994)

In cases of allelic heterogeneity, the MIM number of the entry is followed by a decimal point and a unique 4-digit number specifying the variant. For example, allelic variants in the HBB gene (141900) are numbered 141900.0001 through 141900.0538.

Because OMIM has responsibility for the classification and naming of genetic disorders, these numbers are stable identifiers of the disorders.

=== Symbols preceding MIM numbers ===
Symbols preceding MIM numbers indicate the entry category:
* An asterisk (*) before an entry number indicates a gene.
* A number symbol (#) before an entry number indicates that it is a descriptive entry, usually of a phenotype, and does not represent a unique locus. The reason for the use of the number symbol is given in the first paragraph of the entry. Discussion of any gene(s) related to the phenotype resides in another entry (or entries) as described in the first paragraph.
* A plus sign (+) before an entry number indicates that the entry contains the description of a gene of known sequence and a phenotype.
* A percent sign (%) before an entry number indicates that the entry describes a confirmed Mendelian phenotype or phenotypic locus for which the underlying molecular basis is not known.
* No symbol before an entry number generally indicates a description of a phenotype for which the Mendelian basis, although suspected, has not been clearly established or that the separateness of this phenotype from that in another entry is unclear.
* A caret (^) before an entry number means the entry no longer exists because it was removed from the database or moved to another entry as indicated.

<doc id="670453" wikidata="Q1603101" url="?curid=670453" title="Helly family">
<text>In combinatorics, a Helly family of order is a family of sets in which every minimal &quot;subfamily with an empty intersection&quot; has or fewer sets in it. Equivalently, every finite subfamily such that every -fold intersection is non-empty has non-empty total intersection. The -Helly property is the property of being a Helly family of order .

The number is frequently omitted from these names in the case that . Thus, a set-family has the Helly property if, for every sets formula_1 in the family, if formula_2, then formula_3.

These concepts are named after Eduard Helly (1884–1943); Helly&#x27;s theorem on convex sets, which gave rise to this notion, states that convex sets in Euclidean space of dimension are a Helly family of order .

== Examples ==
* In the family of all subsets of the set {&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;}, the subfamily has an empty intersection, but removing any set from this subfamily causes it to have a nonempty intersection. Therefore, it is a minimal subfamily with an empty intersection. It has four sets in it, and is the largest possible minimal subfamily with an empty intersection, so the family of all subsets of the set {&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;} is a Helly family of order 4.
* Let &quot;I&quot; be a finite set of closed intervals of the real line with an empty intersection. Let &quot;A&quot; be the interval whose left endpoint &quot;a&quot; is as large as possible, and let &quot;B&quot; be the interval whose right endpoint &quot;b&quot; is as small as possible. Then, if &quot;a&quot; were less than or equal to &quot;b&quot;, all numbers in the range [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;] would belong to all intervals of &quot;I&quot;, violating the assumption that the intersection of &quot;I&quot; is empty, so it must be the case that &quot;a&quot; &gt; &quot;b&quot;. Thus, the two-interval subfamily {&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;} has an empty intersection, and the family &quot;I&quot; cannot be minimal unless &quot;I&quot; = {&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;}. Therefore, all minimal families of intervals with empty intersections have two or fewer intervals in them, showing that the set of all intervals is a Helly family of order 2.
* The family of infinite arithmetic progressions of integers also has the 2-Helly property. That is, whenever a finite collection of progressions has the property that no two of them are disjoint, then there exists an integer that belongs to all of them; this is the Chinese remainder theorem.

== Formal definition ==

More formally, a Helly family of order &quot;k&quot; is a set system (&quot;V&quot;, &quot;E&quot;), with &quot;E&quot; a collection of subsets of &quot;V&quot;, such that, for every finite &quot;G&quot; ⊆ &quot;E&quot; with

:formula_4

we can find &quot;H&quot; ⊆ &quot;G&quot; such that

:formula_5

and

:formula_6

In some cases, the same definition holds for every subcollection &quot;G&quot;, regardless of finiteness. However, this is a more restrictive condition. For instance, the open intervals of the real line satisfy the Helly property for finite subcollections, but not for infinite subcollections: the intervals (0,1/&quot;i&quot;) (for &quot;i&quot; = 0, 1, 2, ...) have pairwise nonempty intersections, but have an empty overall intersection.

== Helly dimension ==
If a family of sets is a Helly family of order &quot;k&quot;, that family is said to have Helly number &quot;k&quot;. The Helly dimension of a metric space is one less than the Helly number of the family of metric balls in that space; Helly&#x27;s theorem implies that the Helly dimension of a Euclidean space equals its dimension as a real vector space.

The Helly dimension of a subset S of a Euclidean space, such as a polyhedron, is one less than the Helly number of the family of translates of S. For instance, the Helly dimension of any hypercube is 1, even though such a shape may belong to a Euclidean space of much higher dimension.

Helly dimension has also been applied to other mathematical objects. For instance defines the Helly dimension of a group (an algebraic structure formed by an invertible and associative binary operation) to be one less than the Helly number of the family of left cosets of the group.

== The Helly property ==

If a family of nonempty sets has an empty intersection, its Helly number must be at least two, so the smallest &quot;k&quot; for which the &quot;k&quot;-Helly property is nontrivial is &quot;k&quot; = 2. The 2-Helly property is also known as the Helly property. A 2-Helly family is also known as a Helly family.

A convex metric space in which the closed balls have the 2-Helly property (that is, a space with Helly dimension 1, in the stronger variant of Helly dimension for infinite subcollections) is called injective or hyperconvex. The existence of the tight span allows any metric space to be embedded isometrically into a space with Helly dimension 1.

== The Helly property in hypergraphs ==
A hypergraph is equivalent to a set-family. In hypergraphs terms, a hypergraph &quot;H&quot; = (&quot;V&quot;, &quot;E&quot;) has the Helly property if for every &quot;n&quot; hyperedges formula_7 in &quot;E&quot;, if formula_8, then formula_9. For every hypergraph H, the following are equivalent:

* &quot;H&quot; has the Helly property, and the intersection graph of &quot;H&quot; (the simple graph in which the vertices are &quot;E&quot; and two elements of &quot;E&quot; are linked iff they intersect) is a perfect graph.
* Every partial hypergraph of &quot;H&quot; (i.e., a hypergraph derived from &quot;H&quot; by deleting some hyperedges) has the Konig property, i.e., its maximum-matching size equals its minimum-transversal size.
* Every partial hypergraph of &quot;H&quot; has the property that its maximum degree equals its minimum edge coloring number.

There is a shift in the largest union communities Australian Council of Trade Unions and New Zealand Federation of Labour towards a global solidarity. This shift can be seen through the cultural recognition of a Trans-Tasman world of work.

=== Arts and culture ===
Cultural relations in the Trans-Tasman support a cooperative relationship with the sharing of art between Australian and New Zealand galleries. However, the two become competitors when seeking to secure international blockbuster exhibitions and audiences.

=== Food standards ===
The harmonization of trans-Tasman food standards led to lower compliance costs for industry, fewer regulatory barriers, and more consumer choice.

=== Economic relations ===
The New Zealand and Australian economies are deeply enmeshed as both nation&#x27;s economic traffic receive flow from a single economic market. Prime Minister Fraser from Australia and Prime Minister Muldoon from New Zealand committed themselves to a liberalisation of the economy for goods from both countries and proposed tax reductions. Since then, future prime ministers have reflected this trade liberalisation. The Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement signed in 1983 has been used to guide trade between Australia and New Zealand.

The two nations have an economic power imbalance however, as Australia plays a more important role in the New Zealand economy than New Zealand does for Australia. Australia in comparison will conduct more trade with North and East Asia. As such their bilateral relationship can be uneven and relies on the consulting and weighing of concerns.

=== Memorandum of Understanding 1992 ===
In 1996, Australia and New Zealand agreed to create a single market for air transport that was distinct from the previous agreements which were more restrictive. Some notable changes that affect Trans-Tasman travel include allowing Australia and New Zealand to operate in each other&#x27;s domestic markets.

This was followed by an endorsement of the open skies agreement under the International Civil Aviation Organization in 2007 which further allowed Australia and New Zealand&#x27;s international flights to operate in each other&#x27;s domains beyond to third countries without restriction.

=== Defence and security ===
The two countries defence forces are complementary, and co-operate closely on the international scale, and in maintaining Trans-Tasman security. The equipment is often shared to defend the borders of the nations in the south pacific given the common security purpose of the nations.

== Trans-Tasman crossing ==

The modes of transport for crossing the Trans-Tasman Sea include by sea and by flight.

=== By sea ===
The Trans-Tasman crossing can be undertaken by sailing ships, passenger liners and smaller vessels. There are a range of cruise ships including those from companies Princess Cruises, Royal Caribbean Group, Holland America, Silversea and Oceania Cruises. Private vessels are also allowed to cross this Sea.

=== By flight ===
Flights across the Tasman have been made by a range of aircraft including winged aircraft, airships, and balloons. Flight are available with airlines Qantas, Air New Zealand, Jetstar and Virgin Australia.

The aviation market in the Trans-Tasman region has experienced growth since the introduction of low-cost carriers, specifically Jetstar. Low fares are an important factor for the patronage of flights, alongside check in procedures and airport features. Air transport can significantly affect the economy of the Trans-Tasman through its impact on the tourism, logistics and high value-added manufacturing sectors.

== Trans-Tasman migration ==

There has been significant migration between New Zealand and Australia since the 20th century. Economic and social history between the two countries during early colonial time was influenced by the sealing and whaling industry which saw Trans-Tasman migration. In the 21st century the movement is enabled by the Trans-Tasman travel arrangement which governs the regulatory frameworks and supports high international mobility across the Tasman. There has been a cyclical movement between the two countries, but a strong net movement towards Australia since the late 1960s. Many migrants between the countries have reported a sense of transnationalism where they are able to feel at home in both Australia and New Zealand.

This migration is attributable to economic development driven by globalisation, technological change, business cycles, demographic dynamics, and perceptions. Migration specifically from New Zealand to Australia can be attributable to dissatisfaction and desire for change or a sense of newness. However, 15% of people have stated their migration to Australia was because of temporary travel, and then a decision to stay.

However, there are differences in culture, strategic outlook and governance between the nations that contribute to the distinct differences of the two nations and play a role in migration. Evident differences include topography and geography, both of which influence culture, seasonality, and trade. Australia&#x27;s population size and proximity to Asia contribute to its greater presence in international trade whilst New Zealand&#x27;s landscape and natural surroundings have contributed to the nation&#x27;s political and governance decisions.

== Trans-Tasman travel bubble ==
Trans-Tasman bubble refers to the proposed quarantine free travel bubble for the Trans-Tasman region during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is also known as the COVID-safe travel zone. The travel bubble allows entry across the other country&#x27;s borders. During 2020, there were also plans to extend Australia and NZ&#x27;s planned COVID-safe travel zone to Pacific island countries to mediate the effects of the pandemic on the economy of the Pacific island countries.

In June 2021, the marine industry has also raised the potential for a sea bubble for superyachts and cruises to travel across the Tasman.

== Trans-Tasman legal proceedings ==
There has been historically a legal connection between the case law of the two countries. As such the Trans-Tasman Proceedings Act 2010 was created to streamline the process of managing both civil and criminal proceedings with elements spanning across Australia and New Zealand. This act has provisions regarding service of Australian documents in New Zealand, the granting of interim relief for civil proceedings commencing in the other country, the service of subpoenas, remote appearances, and enforcement of judgments in the other country. This Act concerns largely administrative law and governs the procedural practice across these two countries. Problem solving courts within this region are evolving to better capture Trans-Tasman relations.

== Trans-Tasman sports ==
Sports is popular across both Australia and New Zealand, and both countries participate together in a range of sporting competitions. The nations share an interest in sports law and the governing rules of leagues for sports they compete together on, and those which they compete in separately. Legislators across the nations have taken to addressing legal concerns cooperatively and independently. An instance of influence across the Trans-Tasman for sports law is New Zealand&#x27;s adoption of anti-doping regulations similar to Australia.

=== History ===
Sporting contacts between Australia and New Zealand began shortly before the federation of the Australian colonies in 1901. These contacts embodied a shared sporting culture influenced by Trans-Tasman migration, the induction of Trans-Tasman governing bodies and the sharing of sportsmen for competing in international competitions.

The role of sport has influenced the relationship between the two nations, and history has seen poor sportsmanship have a dampening effect in the Trans-Tasman space. An instance is the 1981 cricket series between Australia and New Zealand where the under-arm bowling incident struck controversy between the nations.

Sport holds a particular importance for New Zealand, and is described by academics as one of their greatest soft powers in the context of politics and diplomatic relations. It has a considerable influence across the Trans-Tasman for its function at the intersection of culture, tourism, economics and health.

=== Sporting competitions ===
Australia-New Zealand Sports rivalries exist across a range of sports, most prominently cricket, rugby league, netball and rugby union. The Bledisloe Cup is a Rugby Union competition which has particular notoriety for sparking Trans-Tasman rivalry. Other major sporting trophies between the countries include the Trans-Tasman Trophy in test cricket, the Chappell–Hadlee Trophy in One Day International cricket, the ANZAC Test in rugby league and the Constellation Cup in netball. The two nationals also share a strong soccer rivalry and formerly played for the Trans-Tasman Cup.

<text>Jean Baptiste Édouard Verreaux (16 September 1810 – 14 March 1868) was a French naturalist, taxidermist, collector, and dealer. Botanist and ornithologist Jules Verreaux was his older brother.

== Career ==
In 1830, Verreaux travelled to South Africa to help his brother pack up a large consignment of specimens. He returned in 1832 before continuing to Sumatra, Java, the Philippines and Indo-China. In 1834, he took control of the family&#x27;s natural history business in Paris.

=== &quot;Lion Attacking a Dromedary&quot; ===

Verreaux designed and constructed the orientalist taxidermy diorama &quot;Lion Attacking a Dromedary&quot; for the Paris Exposition of 1867, where it won a gold medal. After the exposition, it was sold to the American Museum of Natural History, who exhibited it at the 1876 Centennial Exposition. The diorama was sold to the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in 1898, where it was displayed until its removal in 2020. The museum cited the work&#x27;s lack of cultural accuracy and concerns raised by the Black Lives Matter movement as the reasons for the removal. In 2021, the diorama was put back on display at the Pittsburgh museum.

<text>Vera Igorevna Zvonareva (; born 7 September 1984) is a Russian inactive professional tennis player. Her career-high singles ranking by the WTA is No. 2 and in doubles world No. 7. Zvonareva has won twelve career singles titles, including the 2009 Indian Wells Open, and reached the finals of the 2008 WTA Tour Championships, 2010 Wimbledon Championships, and 2010 US Open. She was also a bronze medalist at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

In doubles, Zvonareva has won five major titles. Three came in women&#x27;s doubles, first at the 2006 US Open, partnering Nathalie Dechy, and the 2012 Australian Open, with Svetlana Kuznetsova. Following her return to tennis, Zvonareva won her third women&#x27;s doubles major title at the 2020 US Open, partnering Laura Siegemund. Her other two major titles came in mixed doubles, the first at the 2004 US Open with Bob Bryan, and her second at the 2006 Wimbledon Championships, with Andy Ram. She also won the doubles title at the 2023 WTA Finals partnering Siegemund.

==Early life==
Zvonareva was born in 1984 in Moscow to Igor Zvonarev and Natalia Bykova. Igor played Bandy in the USSR championship with Dynamo Moscow, and Nataliya played field hockey and was the bronze medalist at the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games. Zvonareva was introduced to tennis at age six by her mother.

==Career==
===1999–2002: Early career, ITF titles and top 50===
Zvonareva started to compete on the ITF Women&#x27;s Circuit in 1999, debuting at a tournament in Tbilisi, Georgia. She won three qualifying matches there to reach the main draw before losing in the first round.

The following year 2000, she turned professional and won an ITF event in Moscow, without dropping a set, despite being unranked. The event was just the second event she had played in her professional career. Five weeks later, she made her WTA-level debut at the Tier I tournament in Moscow, beating world No. 148, Elena Bovina, before losing to world No. 11, Anna Kournikova, in the second round. In 2001, she failed to qualify for WTA Tour events in Key Biscayne and Moscow, but reached a semifinal at the ITF tournament in Civitanova, Italy. During this time, she won the Orange Bowl Under-18s event in 2000 and 2001.

In 2002, Zvonareva won her second ITF title in Naples, Florida and in July reached her first singles final on the WTA Tour at Palermo, losing to Mariana Díaz Oliva, in three sets. She also achieved semifinal finishes in Warsaw and Sopot, plus a quarterfinal finish in Bol, Croatia. Zvonareva won three qualifying matches at the French Open to reach the main draw for the first time at a Grand Slam tournament. She lost there in the fourth round to eventual champion, Serena Williams, in three sets. Her ranking was high enough for a direct entry into the Wimbledon Championships, where she lost in the second round to the 23rd seed Iva Majoli. At the US Open, Zvonareva lost to world No. 7, Kim Clijsters, in the third round. Her ranking rose into the top 100 after the French Open and into the top 50 after the US Open.

===2003–2004: French Open quarterfinal, top-10 debut and first major doubles title===
In 2003, Zvonareva won the title at the Tier-III event in Bol, beating Conchita Martínez Granados in the final, and reached three other semifinals (including the Tier-II event in Linz). She defeated a top-10 player for the first time when she beat world No. 10, Anastasia Myskina, in Berlin. At the French Open, Zvonareva defeated world No. 3, Venus Williams, in the fourth round, before losing in the quarterfinals to world No. 76, Nadia Petrova. Her French Open results caused her ranking to enter the top 20. She reached the quarterfinals in six out of the seven Tier I events she contested. Her debut for Russia in Fed Cup was in the World Group quarterfinals against Slovenia. Russia won 5–0, but lost to France 2–3 in the semifinals. In doubles, she reached her first WTA Tour final at Moscow with Myskina. She ended the year ranked No. 13.

In 2004, Zvonareva won her first career Grand Slam title, winning the mixed doubles competition at the US Open with Bob Bryan. She won one singles title, in Memphis and reached the final of the events in Cincinnati and Philadelphia, losing to top-10 players Lindsay Davenport and Amélie Mauresmo. In the final of the Memphis event, Zvonareva trailed hometown favorite Lisa Raymond 5–2 in the third set, before saving three match points and winning the last five games of the match to win the title. In addition to this, she reached the semifinals of three Tier-I tournaments in Rome, San Diego, and Montreal. She lost in San Diego to fellow Russian Anastasia Myskina in a match that featured a final set tiebreak that ended 17–15. Zvonareva and Myskina teamed in the final of the Fed Cup, playing in the crucial final rubber against Marion Bartoli and Émilie Loit, which the pair won, 7–6, 7–5, to seal Russia&#x27;s first Fed Cup title.

Zvonareva ended 2004 the year ranked world No. 11. In August, she reached her then-career high of world No. 9. Because of several withdrawals, Zvonareva was able to compete at the WTA Championships, an event reserved for the top eight players in the world. She was unable to win a match and exited at the round-robin stage.

===2005: First injury===
Zvonareva obtained an invitation from the Hong Kong Tennis Patrons&#x27; Association to play in the Watsons Water Champions Challenge. She defended her Memphis title, defeating Meghann Shaughnessy but she was injured in the second half of 2005. Her ranking dropped from No. 11 to 42.

===2006: Two major doubles titles===

In 2006, Zvonareva won her first women&#x27;s doubles major tournament at the US Open, partnering Nathalie Dechy of France. She obtained a second mixed doubles title at Wimbledon, partnering Andy Ram of Israel. They defeated Bob Bryan and Venus Williams, in straight sets. She garnered some success in singles competition, winning two titles in a season for the first time in her career. This included her first tournament win on grass, at the Birmingham Classic in England. Her other title came in Cincinnati, where she played a nearly flawless match against Serena Williams in the semifinals, and beat Katarina Srebotnik in the final.

===2007: Second injury===
The 2007 season was a year of mixed fortune for Zvonareva. At Indian Wells, she stunned world No. 1, Maria Sharapova, who was the defending champion, in three sets in the fourth round, marking her first victory over a reigning world No. 1. However, she fell in the next round to Li Na. At her next tournament, the Charleston Open, she retired when playing Dinara Safina and down a set, due to a left wrist injury. This injury kept her out of the European clay-court season, the grass-court season, and most of the North American hard-court season. On returning to the tour, she reached the third round of the US Open, losing to Serena Williams. At the remaining tournaments on her schedule, she reached the quarterfinals or better at four out of five, with semifinal finishes in Luxembourg and Quebec. Her one final came during the first week of the year, in Auckland, New Zealand.

===2008: Back into top 10, Olympic bronze and WTA Tour Championships final===

==Rivalries==
===Zvonareva vs. Wozniacki===
Zvonareva and Caroline Wozniacki have met nine times, with Zvonareva leading their head-to-head 5–4.

They have met in three finals, Wozniacki winning two of them: in rain-delayed finals at the 2010 Rogers Cup and the China Open, the latter of which was contested whilst they reigned as two of the top three players in the world, whilst Zvonareva prevailed in Qatar in 2011. In 2010, they met in two important semifinals: Zvonareva winning at the US Open and Wozniacki prevailing at the 2010 WTA Tour Championships in a match which decided which of the two would finish 2010 ranked world No. 1.

===Zvonareva vs. Radwańska===

Zvonareva had a rivalry with the Polish player Agnieszka Radwańska, which began in 2007. Radwańska led the series 4–2.

Throughout their meetings, Radwańska matched Zvonareva&#x27;s pace and movements around the court, with Zvonareva considered the more powerful of the two, but Radwańska noted as more focused at times, utilizing what &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;&#x27;s Courtney Nguyen dubbed &quot;selective aggression&quot; during their matches in 2011.

At the 2007 Kremlin Cup, Zvonareva won their first meeting in straight sets. The two did not play again until 2011, when Radwańska won four of their five matches, including the finals of the Mercury Insurance Open and the Pan Pacific Open. Their final meeting of 2011 was an acclaimed match at the WTA Championships. In the third set, Zvonareva served for the match while leading 5–3. However, Radwańska saved three match points and went on to win 1–6, 6–2, 7–5. The victory marked Radwańska&#x27;s fourth straight win against Zvonareva, whom she described as &quot;very consistent and always tough to beat.&quot;

===Zvonareva vs. Clijsters===
Zvonareva has a 3–7 record against Kim Clijsters.

The Belgian won their first five matches, from 2002 until Clijsters&#x27; first retirement in 2007. When Clijsters returned in 2010, Zvonareva won the next three matches, including one at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships, then lost the US Open final. Clijsters won their meeting at the 2011 Australian Open. They met for the final time at Wimbledon 2012, where Zvonareva retired after the second set for medical reasons. 

===Zvonareva vs. Stosur===
Zvonareva has a 3–8 head-to-head record against Samantha Stosur. She lost eight times in a row to the Australian before coming from behind to win 4–6, 6–2, 6–2 at the 2020 Indian Wells Challenger. Zvonareva has never lost to any other player eight times in a row.

Stosur puts heavy topspin onto the ball, which has proven detrimental to Zvonareva&#x27;s ball-striking ability. Stosur&#x27;s style has impeded Zvonareva&#x27;s ability to predict where Stosur is going to place the ball when she runs around her backhand to hit her forehand inside out.

==Personal life==
In 2007, Zvonareva graduated from the Russian State University of Physical Education with a degree in Physical Education. She studied for a second degree in international economic relations at the Diplomatic Academy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Moscow.

On 23 August 2016, Zvonareva announced her marriage. Her husband Alexander Kucher is a former officer who worked in the administration of the Moscow Oblast and currently works in the logistic division of the German hardware store OBI. Their daughter Evelina was born in 2016.

=== Legal issues ===
In July 2023, Zvonareva was controversially denied entry into Poland after she tried entering with a French visa to play at the 2023 WTA Poland Open.

<text>Television Centre (TVC), formerly known as BBC Television Centre, is a building complex in White City, West London, which was the headquarters of BBC Television from 1960 to 2013, when BBC Television moved to Broadcasting House. After a refurbishment, the complex reopened in 2017 with three studios in use for TV production, operated by BBC Studioworks. The first BBC staff moved into the Scenery Block in 1953, and the centre was officially opened on 29 June 1960. It is one of the most readily recognisable facilities of its type, having appeared as the backdrop for many BBC programmes. Parts of the building are Grade II listed, including the central ring and Studio 1.

Most of the BBC&#x27;s national television and radio news output came from Television Centre, and in later years most recorded television was output from the nearby Broadcast Centre at 201 Wood Lane, care of Red Bee Media. Live television events from studios and routing of national and international sporting events took place within Television Centre before being passed to the Broadcast Centre for transmission.

The building is west of central London, in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham. The nearest Underground stations are White City on the Central Line and Wood Lane on the Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City Lines.

==History==

On Friday 1 April 1949, Norman Collins, the Controller of the BBC Television Service, announced at the Television Society&#x27;s annual dinner at The Waldorf Hilton, London that a new TV centre would be built in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush. London broadcasts at the time came from Alexandra Palace and Lime Grove Studios (from 1949). It was to be the largest television centre in the world.

It was planned to be , but turned out to be twice the size. The building was commissioned in 1949 with work starting in 1950. However government restrictions on building, through its loan sanction and licensing of materials, ensured that building work was halted until 1953. Intended as stopgaps, the BBC remodelled the former Gaumont Studios at Lime Grove, the Riverside Studios in Hammersmith and the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire for television production spaces and studio use; many of these facilities were still being used by the corporation decades later.

Work resumed in 1953 on the TVC scenery block (Stage 1) and work began in 1954 on the canteen block (Stage 2), which doubled as a rehearsal space. Work on Stage 3, the central circular office block and studios, began in March 1955 on studios TC4, 5 and 2. The shells of studios TC1, TC6 and TC7 were constructed around the same time but they were not fitted out until a few years later. BBC Television Centre officially opened with TC3 operational on 29 June 1960. When it opened in June 1960, the Director of BBC television was Gerald Beadle, and the first programme broadcast was &quot;First Night&quot; with David Nixon in Studio Three.

In 1997, the BBC News Centre was opened, in a new complex at the front of the building. The decision to move radio news to this building was attributed to Director General John Birt, a move that was resisted by the managing director of BBC Radio, Liz Forgan, who resigned after failing to dissuade the governors. Birt&#x27;s decision caused problems; for example some politicians accustomed to travelling to interviews at Broadcasting House in Central London were reluctant to make the journey to White City, despite being only west.

===Redevelopment===

It was announced on 18 October 2007 that in order to meet a £2 billion shortfall in funding, the BBC intended to &quot;reduce the size of the property portfolio in west London by selling BBC Television Centre by the end of the financial year 2012/13&quot;, with the then Director General, Mark Thompson, saying the plan would deliver &quot;a smaller, but fitter, BBC&quot; in the digital age. A BBC spokesman has added that &quot;this is a full scale disposal of BBC Television Centre and we won&#x27;t be leasing it back&quot;. The corporation officially put Television Centre on the property market in June 2011.

BBC Sport and BBC Children&#x27;s moved to dock10, MediaCityUK in Salford Quays in 2012, with Children&#x27;s Learning, Radio 5 Live and part of BBC Future Media &amp; Technology. The move saw up to 1,500 posts at TV Centre and 700 posts at New Broadcasting House relocate to Salford Quays. &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot;, part of BBC News, moved to Salford in April 2012.

On 16 July 2012, the BBC agreed to sell the site to Stanhope for £200 million. The building closed on 31 March 2013 and was redeveloped to include flats, office space, a cinema and hotels. Studios 1, 2 and 3 along with part of the basement and offices have been refurbished and leased back to the BBC on a 15-year lease. The original schedule would have seen Studios 1, 2, &amp; 3 back in production by Autumn of 2014 however on 17 July 2014 the BBC announced that due to the extensive building work, programme production would not recommence at Television Centre until 2017 when much of the demolition and groundwork has been completed. The BBC&#x27;s commercial business, BBC Studios, will lease back Stage 6 as office space which is the part formerly occupied by BBC News.
All BBC News, national radio and BBC World Service broadcasts were relocated to Broadcasting House between July 2012 and March 2013, which is said to include one of the largest live newsrooms in the world. The final news broadcasts from Television Centre took place on 18 March 2013, when the BBC News channel and remaining news output completed the move to Broadcasting House. This was one of the final live broadcasts from the building.

A 90-minute documentary titled &quot;Tales of Television Centre&quot; was broadcast on BBC Four in 2012 ahead of the move out. On 22 March 2013, BBC Four devoted its evening schedule to programmes commemorating Television Centre. At the heart of the evening was &quot;Goodbye Television Centre&quot;, a two-hour history presented by former BBC1 controller and BBC chairman Michael Grade. The last live programme broadcast was &quot;Madness Live: Goodbye Television Centre&quot;, shown that day on BBC Four.

In March 2013, the BBC and Stanhope formed a joint venture, Television Centre Developments, to manage the redevelopment of the 14-acre site. Only three of the eight production studios were earmarked for continued use by the BBC, with the rest being demolished for flats, and it was argued that this would leave insufficient facilities in the capital for independent television production, and a &quot;Save Television Centre Studios&quot; website and petition was set up.

In December 2013, Stanhope was granted planning permission from the London Borough of Hammersmith &amp; Fulham.

In October 2014, UK magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; reported that having spent £60 million to remove broadcasting equipment from the building, the BBC planned to spend £12 million a year to lease back parts of the building. This decision was in direct contradiction of the BBC&#x27;s promise in 2007 that the sale of TVC was a &quot;full-scale disposal&quot; and that it would not be leasing back any part of the building.

Demolition work began in February 2015.

As of April 2016, only Studios TC1, TC2 and TC3 remained – the other studios TC4, TC5, TC6, TC7 and TC8 had all been demolished. The statue of Helios, the Greek God of Sun, had been removed for renovation before it returned later in 2016; developer Stanhope and construction manager Mace had carefully removed the gilded bronze figure with heritage experts PAYE Conservation for repair and renovation. The Helios has stood in the rotunda at Television Centre since the former BBC headquarters opened in 1960.

===Reopening===
BBC Studioworks, the commercial subsidiary of the BBC operate and maintain Studios 1, 2 and 3 and the production facilities at Television Centre. The newly refurbished facilities officially opened on 1 September 2017. As of April 2017, bookings for the renovated studios were being taken.

The first programme to transmit live from the newly refurbished studios was &quot;Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two&quot; on BBC Two on Monday 25 September 2017. It was hosted by Zoe Ball.

In April 2018, ITV&#x27;s daytime programmes &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot;, &quot;Lorraine&quot;, &quot;This Morning&quot;, &quot;Loose Women&quot; and political discussion programme &quot;Peston&quot; moved to Television Centre, due to the closure and redevelopment of The London Studios. However, in October 2018, it was announced that ITV would not be returning to the South Bank, and it is thought that ITV Daytime programmes will continue to be broadcast from Television Centre.

On 29 June 2020, Television Centre turned 60 years old and the Royal Television Society released a commemorative programme to celebrate.

==The building==

===Design===

The overall design from the air appeared to resemble a question mark in shape. The architect, Graham Dawbarn, (Norman &amp; Dawbarn), drew a question mark on an envelope (now held by the BBC Written Archives Centre) while thinking about the design of the building, and realised that it would be an ideal shape for the site. An article in &quot;The BBC Quarterly&quot;, July 1946, proposed a circular design, several years before Dawbarn drew up his plans.

The building featured a central circular block (officially known as the Main Block, but often referred to by staff as the &quot;doughnut&quot;) around which were studios, offices, engineering areas and the News Centre.

===Helios===

In the centre of the main block was a statue designed by T. B. Huxley-Jones of Helios, the Greek god of the sun, to symbolise the radiation of television around the world. At the foot of the statue were two reclining figures, symbolising sound and vision, the components of television. It was originally a fountain, but owing to the building&#x27;s unique shape it was too noisy for the staff in the overlooking offices, and there were problems with water leakage into the videotape area which for a long time was directly beneath. Even though there was a foundation stone marked &#x27;BBC 1956&#x27; in the basement of the main building, construction began in 1951.

Arthur Hayes worked on the building from 1956 to 1970 and was responsible for the creation of the original &#x27;BBC Television Centre&#x27; lettering on the façade of Studio 1. The lettering was later used all over the building, even in tile work outside lift entrances. Demands from Broadcasting House meant that Hayes had less time than he had thought to design a decor for the façade, leading to him puncturing a scale foam model of the wall with drawing pins, and thus the birth of the iconic : there are 26 across the façade of Studio 1, each one backlit and clearly visible at night.

The building as opened in 1960 was extended a number of times, notably along the &#x27;spur&#x27; towards Wood Lane in line with the original masterplan although the actual implementation was completed over a number of decades and by different architects. Despite a number of extensions, the BBC had to seek accommodation elsewhere, such as the nearby BBC White City complex comprising White City One, a 25,000 square metre office building, and the adjacent Broadcast and Media Centres.

===Listed status===
The development of the Westfield shopping centre nearby led to a sharp rise in property prices and placed the Television Centre under threat. In February 2008, with an amendment in November, English Heritage requested listed status for the scenery workshop, the canteen block adjoining the Blue Peter Garden, and the central building. Previously, under a longstanding deal between the BBC and English Heritage the building was not listed to allow the BBC to make changes necessary in a broadcasting centre. In return, the BBC agreed that if it left, the fabric of the building would be restored to its mid-1960s state, and English Heritage would list notable features.

On 17 June 2009 the Central Ring of the building and Studio 1, noting in particular the John Piper mosaic, central drum with its mosaic tiles, the Huxley-Jones gilded statue of Helios, full-height glazing of the stair and original clock in the Central Ring, received Grade II listed status from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. The &#x27;atomic dots&#x27; and name of Studio 1, and the cantilevered porch on its exterior were noted as important architectural features of that building. The department did not consider the other buildings, including all other studios, scenery block and canteen of sufficient special interest to warrant listing. Making the protection announcement, the architecture minister Barbara Follett noted that it was where &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; and &quot;Blue Peter&quot; were made: &quot;It has been a torture chamber for politicians, and an endless source of first-class entertainment for the nation—sometimes both at the same time.&quot;

===Current studios===

Currently, and in the later years of the BBC&#x27;s occupation of the centre, the studio facilities were run by the wholly owned commercial subsidiary BBC Studioworks. The studios vary in size and all studios were usually abbreviated to initials, such as TC1 (Television Centre 1) for Studio 1.

The studios have hosted a wide variety of television programmes covering a diverse range of genres for a range of broadcasters. Notable productions hosted at the centre prior to 2013 include &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, &quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s TV Burp&quot;, &quot;Match of the Day&quot;, &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot;, &quot;Miranda&quot;, &quot;The Alan Titchmarsh Show&quot;, &quot;The Armstrong &amp; Miller Show&quot;, &quot;8 Out of 10 Cats&quot; as well as big complex live productions such as Children in Need and Comic Relief. Classic BBC productions hosted at the site include some of Britain&#x27;s best known television programmes including &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;, &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;, the original &quot;Doctor Who&quot; series and most of the best known BBC drama series.

From the 1980s the use of the complex for such productions declined with the last major drama series to be shot there being &quot;The House of Eliott&quot;, which ended in 1994, and the last single drama recorded was &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, in 1995. The reason for the decline was because drama productions (except for soap operas) shifted almost entirely onto film or single-camera video, and Television Centre was a video-based, multi-camera production environment.

*Studio 1 - - Opened on 15 April 1964, it was the fourth largest television studio in Britain, and was one of the four studios to be equipped for HDTV production (along with TC4, TC6 and TC8). In May 2020, &quot;Loose Women&quot; temporarily moved from TC2 into TC1 to allow for social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic in London. In mid-July, Loose Women returned to TC2.

Programmes recorded or transmitted included:

*&quot;Sounds Like Friday Night&quot;
*&quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot;
*&quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot;
*&quot;The Jonathan Ross Show&quot;
*&quot;The Russell Howard Hour&quot;
*&quot;Blind Date&quot;
*&quot;BBC Radio 1&#x27;s Teen Awards&quot;
*&quot;The Last Leg&quot;

*Studio 2 - Opened in late 1960, the studio was home to many comedy programmes, among those being &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot;. Initially, it was not converted for colour production, and closed in 1969, with the studio space being used for storage until it reopened in 1981. It was used by BBC News until they moved in 1997, and has played host to the Sports and Children&#x27;s department. It was the main studio used for &quot;Blue Peter&quot; for the 2007 and 2008 series. It was vacated following the move of both departments to dock10. Studio 2 is currently the home of the ITV programmes &quot;Lorraine&quot;, &quot;Loose Women&quot; and &quot;Peston&quot;, in addition to Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Brunch&quot;.

*Studio 3 - - Opened on 29 June 1960, it was designed as a drama studio and had customised panels and fittings. The walls were slightly thicker to insulate it from noise from the Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines (then still part of the Metropolitan line) of the London Underground. It was the first studio to be completed and was upgraded to colour in 1969. Studio 3 currently broadcasts ITV programmes &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; and &quot;This Morning&quot;. It was one of two studios that hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 1963; the other being Studio 4.

===Former studios===
*Studio 0 - - Opened in 1989 as a music studios, it would later become a control room as Studio 12. Productions for UK Play and, later on, virtual reality programmes, were produced here. It was home to &quot;Liquid News&quot; between 2000 and 2002 and CBeebies in vision continuity between 2002 and 2008, with the studio subsequently used by BBC R&amp;D.

*Studio 4 - - Opened in January 1961, TC4 had a similar layout to TC3, and was designed as a light entertainment studio. It was upgraded for colour production in 1970 and to HDTV and surround sound production in 2008. Programmes such as &quot;Z-Cars&quot;, &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, and &quot;Room 101&quot; were recorded in TC4.

*Studio 5 - - Opened in August 1961, it was initially used to broadcast programmes from BBC Schools, with an adjacent area used for such programming that was linked to the studio. It was converted for colour production in 1973, and was closed in the mid-1980s. Following a two-year refurbishment in 1987, sports programmes such as &quot;Match of the Day&quot;, &quot;Football Focus&quot;, and &quot;Grandstand&quot; were recorded in TC5 until November 2011, when the Sports department moved to MediaCityUK in Salford.

*Studio 6 - - Coinciding with BBC Two&#x27;s switch to colour, TC6 opened in July 1967. It was the first such studio to be equipped for colour production. The initial plan was to build a split studio with a large, removable wall in the middle, but such idea was abandoned. Children&#x27;s programmes such as &quot;Live &amp; Kicking&quot; and &quot;Dick &amp; Dom in da Bungalow&quot;, and &quot;Pointless&quot; were recorded in TC6. Later, the control room of the studio was moved in 1993 and was used as the control room for the Red Button service. It was converted for HDTV production in July 2010, and later became the first 3D-capable studio in Britain.

*Studio 7 - - Opened in 1962, children&#x27;s programmes such as &quot;Going Live!&quot; and &quot;Play School&quot; were initially recorded in TC7. Following BBC News&#x27; move to the studio in 1997, news programmes such as &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot; and &quot;BBC News at Six&quot; were broadcast, with other news programmes transmitted from various studios in the News Centre. BBC Breakfast ended its broadcast in TC7 on 5 April 2012, with production moving to MediaCityUK, and BBC News at Six ended its broadcast on 15 March 2013, with news programming subsequently moving to Broadcasting House in central London.

*Studio 8 - - Opened in 1967, it was considered, by television producers, the best studio for use, owing to its size. It primarily broadcast comedy programmes, sitcoms and quiz shows such as &quot;Miranda&quot;, &quot;Tipping Point&quot; and &quot;Five Minutes to a Fortune&quot;. It was the first studio to be converted for HDTV production, having done so in January 2007.

*Studio 9 - - Built in 1955 as a foyer of the restaurant block, it was later converted to a store. It was converted to a studio in 1996 for CBBC, and was cited for its convenience and its roominess. CBBC left the studios in 2004, and all in-vision continuity was moved 2 years later to TC12. Programmes such as &quot;Sam &amp; Mark&#x27;s TMi Friday&quot; and &quot;SMart&quot; were recorded from TC9.

====Studio 10====
111 square metres (1,200 ft2)

Opened as N1 in September 1969, it was used for the BBC1 daytime news bulletins, and the home of BBC World (previously BBC World Service News) from 1993. Closed in spring 1999 when news bulletins moved to the News Centre section of Television Centre, and renamed as TC10. Used for some programmes by channel UK Play until the station&#x27;s closure. Between 2004 and 2006 it was used for in-vision continuity for CBBC on BBC One and BBC Two, before being used by some programming for CBBC such as &quot;Level Up&quot;. From 2010 to 2011 it was the home of CBeebies.

====Studio 11====
186 square metres (2,000 ft2)

Opened as N2 in September 1969, and the same size as N1, it was used for the BBC2 daytime news bulletins. Extended in 1985 to include props store and adjacent lobby, it became home to the &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock&quot; and &quot;Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;. In spring 1999, following the completion of the News Centre spur of Television Centre, the news moved out and it was renamed TC11. In 2002 it became home to &quot;Liquid News&quot; and later to the other BBC Three news programmes &quot;60 Seconds&quot; and &quot;The 7 O&#x27;Clock News&quot;. It briefly played host to the domestic BBC News bulletins while their studios were refurbished in 2006, before becoming general purpose. It was home to &quot;Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two&quot; until 15 December 2011, after which the studio was closed.

====Studio 12====
56 square metres (600 ft2)

Originally built as a control room for the music studio originally located in Studio 0. Studio 12 was converted into an ad-hoc studio in 2004 for CBBC programmes. It was also used for &quot;Sportsround&quot; for some years, but was eventually converted into a presentation studio in 2006. It was used for in-vision continuity for CBBC and changed into an in-vision continuity studio in summer 2007. The set was transferred to a mini studio in the East Tower. It was used by BBC Research.

====Pres A====
65 square metres (704 ft2)

Opened in 1960, designed for in-vision continuity for BBC 1, but was used as such for only three years. Became weather studio prior to the move to the BBC Weather Centre in 1990 (also in Television Centre), following which it was used by Children&#x27;s BBC to supplement presentation from the &#x27;Broom Cupboard&#x27;, and was used for slots such as birthdays and public holidays. It became full-time home of Children&#x27;s BBC in 1994 following the vacation of the &#x27;Broom Cupboard&#x27;. It closed following CBBC&#x27;s move to TC9 and was converted into additional presentation control rooms. The substantially thick wall between Pres A and B was removed and a mezzanine floor constructed to house a larger presentation control area for interactive and children&#x27;s channels CBBC and CBeebies.

====Pres B====
65 square metres (704 ft2)

Opened in 1964, Pres B was designed for in-vision continuity for BBC 2, but that channel did not use in-vision continuity for more than a few months after launch. Became a general purpose studio housing small productions such as &quot;Points of View&quot;, the &quot;Film&quot; series with Barry Norman and &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;. It closed in 1996 and initially remained disused until it was converted (along with Pres A) into additional presentation control rooms. The substantially thick wall between Pres A and B was removed and a mezzanine floor constructed to house a larger presentation control area for interactive and children&#x27;s channels CBBC and CBeebies.

====News studios====
In addition to these studios, BBC News used a number of studios for the frequent news bulletins. These studios have a different naming system owing to their permanent usage and were not included on most studio lists, as they were unavailable for hire.

* N1 – Previously BBC One daytime bulletins. Became TC10
* N2 – Previously BBC Two daytime bulletins. Became TC11
* N3 – Small studio off main newsroom, before being made part of newsroom, separated by glass panels.
* N4 – Studio, became part of the BBC Club bar
* N5 – Originally studio for BBC Arabic Television service, which closed in 1996. It was a storeroom until 2001 when it was used for the BBCi service, then from 2007 as a home for &quot;Click&quot; prior to its move to Broadcasting House in 2012.
* N6 – Formerly home to &quot;BBC News at One&quot;, &quot;BBC News at Ten&quot; and the BBC News channel.
* N8 – Home to BBC World News prior to its move to Broadcasting House in 2013, and by the BBC News channel from 1999 to 2008. BBC News channel still used the studio to allow the &quot;BBC News at Ten&quot; to rehearse in N6 until 2013
* N9 – Home to BBC World News until 2008 and BBC News 24 from 1997 to 1999, used as a contingency when N6/N8 unavailable due to technical work and for election coverage
* N10 – Formerly used by BBC Three to produce &quot;60 Seconds&quot;

These studios were located in Stage 5 &amp; Stage 6, commonly known as the BBC News Centre. BBC News moved out of Stage 6 in 2013 to the new BBC News Centre at New Broadcasting House in Central London. After redevelopment, Stage 6 became the new home to the commercial arm of the BBC, BBC Studios.

There was no N7, to avoid confusion with TC7, which housed &#x27;big&#x27; news programmes such as &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot;, &quot;Working Lunch&quot;, and &quot;Newsnight&quot;.

===Infrastructure===

In February 1996, the electricity and heating were transferred to a European Gas Turbines (EGT) 4.9MWe Typhoon gas turbine combined heating, power and cooling unit. It included a 6MW Thermax air conditioning (cooling) vapour absorption machine (VAM). The £6m HVAC system reduced energy costs by 35%, and paid for itself within three years. A second turbine was added, without a second chimney. However, in 2008 the BBC admitted that the energy system was being used for emergency purposes only as it had become cost-ineffective to use full-time. Excess electricity produced at night has not been returned to the National Grid, as originally planned. In November 2003, the turbine&#x27;s chimneys caught fire, bringing TV output to a halt. After the fire the turbines were no longer used regularly.

==Major events==
===Terrorist target===
On 4 March 2001, a bomb placed outside the news centre exploded, with no fatalities. It was attributed to the Real IRA and the culprits were eventually caught. The front of the building suffered moderate damage, but was soon repaired.

===Power failures===
Television Centre has suffered from power cuts that affected normal broadcasting, but these were not seen as a systemic problem. One such power cut caused the launch night of BBC2, on 20 April 1964, to be cancelled; programmes began the next day.

A major power failure occurred on 20 June 2000 at approximately 5 p.m., affecting the entire Television Centre resulting in services such as BBC One, BBC Two and BBC Radio 4 coming off air and/or altering their schedules. BBC News 24 went off air twice before being relocated to the BBC&#x27;s Westminster studios and simulcasting with BBC World (marking a rare occurrence where BBC World was broadcast to UK viewers). The &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot; suffered severe lighting problems and had to be cancelled halfway through, and the BBC&#x27;s backup generator caught fire. Troubles were experienced in the South East region, as &quot;Newsroom South East&quot; started later than planned. The fire alarms went off at Television Centre later that day, leaving only a skeleton crew. Eventually many programmes returned, from different locations: &quot;Newsnight&quot; was presented from the main news studio with intermittent technical problems. The issues were attributed to a failing substation in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush. Normal services resumed the following day.

Just before 8 a.m. on 28 November 2003 an electrical fault caused some equipment to overheat, which set off fire alarms. Although there was no fire, the fault caused widespread power cuts and prevented backup generators from providing alternative power. All output was affected with services transferred across London to alternative studios. The One O&#x27;Clock News and BBC News 24 broadcast for much of the day from the BBC&#x27;s Millbank Studios, and the &quot;Today&quot; programme and Five Live&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast&quot; morning radio shows fell off air for 15 minutes. The Millbank Studios are a fall-back for news operations in the event of TVC failure, and are continually recording the last hour of the BBC News Channel output (without in-vision clock) for this purpose. This power cut came on the week prior to the relaunch of News 24 as well as BBC World, which was postponed for another week to ensure that all problems had been remedied.

===Protests===
Programmes have been interrupted by protesters gaining access to Television Centre. In 1988, a group of lesbian protestors campaigning against Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988 gained access to the studio of the &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot; during a live broadcast. Newsreader Sue Lawley continued with the broadcast, while co-presenter Nicholas Witchell tackled the intruders off-camera.

On 20 May 2006, during the live broadcast of &quot;National Lottery: Jet Set&quot; the studio was invaded by members of the Fathers 4 Justice campaign group, causing the show to go briefly off air while the protesters were removed. This was also a problem as that night&#x27;s lottery broadcast ran straight into the Eurovision Song Contest 2006.

For &quot;Question Time&quot; on 22 October 2009, the BBC invited the leader of the British National Party, Nick Griffin, onto the programme for the first time, causing heated public debate and strong protests outside the studios. Television Centre had its security breached with around 30 anti-fascist protesters storming the reception area and several hundred protesters gathering outside. Police and security staff were forced to close gates leading into the centre and form barriers to prevent any further breaches of security.

On 9 August 2021, a number of anti-vaccine protestors upset with BBC News for &quot;promoting Covid-19 vaccines&quot; attempted to gain access to Television Centre. The BBC&#x27;s news operations were not on site as they had left the facility in 2013. Police were deployed to prevent the protestors entering BBC Studioworks, and some of the protesters later marched to Broadcasting House where BBC News is based.

<text>&quot;The Song of the Walloons&quot; (; ) is the regional anthem of Wallonia in Belgium. The original lyrics were written by Théophile Bovy in 1900 in the Walloon language. A year later, it was set to music composed by Louis Hillier. Performed for the first time in the city of Liège, the song quickly spread to other parts of French-speaking Belgium and established itself like a &quot;national&quot; anthem for Wallonia. 

It was approved on 15 July 1998 by the Parliament of Wallonia, along with the region&#x27;s coat of arms and flag.

==Lyrics==
Typically, only the first and third verses are performed.

<text>Klaus von Klitzing (; born 28 June 1943) is a German physicist, known for discovery of the integer quantum Hall effect, for which he was awarded the 1985 Nobel Prize in Physics.

==Education==
In 1962, Klitzing passed the Abitur at the Artland-Gymnasium in Quakenbrück, Germany, before studying physics at the Braunschweig University of Technology, where he received his diploma in 1969. He continued his studies at the University of Würzburg at the chair of Gottfried Landwehr, completing his PhD thesis entitled &quot;Galvanomagnetic Properties of Tellurium in Strong Magnetic Fields&quot; in 1972, and gaining habilitation in 1978.

==Research and career==
During his career Klitzing has worked at the Clarendon Laboratory at the University of Oxford and the Grenoble High Magnetic Field Laboratory in France (now LNCMI), where he continued to work until becoming a professor at the Technical University of Munich in 1980. He has been a director of the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research in Stuttgart since 1985.

The von Klitzing constant, &quot;R&quot;K = &quot;h&quot;/&quot;e&quot;2 = is named in honor of Klaus von Klitzing&#x27;s discovery of the quantum Hall effect, and is listed in the National Institute of Standards and Technology &quot;Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty&quot;. The inverse of the constant is equal to half the value of the conductance quantum.

More recently, Klitzing&#x27;s research focuses on the properties of low-dimensional electronic systems, typically in low temperatures and in high magnetic fields.

==Honours and awards==
Von Klitzing has won numerous awards and honours including:

* 1981 Walter Schottky Prize
* 1982 EPS Europhysics Prize
* 1982 Hewlett-Packard Prize
* 1985 Nobel Prize in Physics

<text>Alexander Ernst Alfred Hermann [[Freiherr]] von Falkenhausen (29 October 187831 July 1966) was a German general and military advisor to Chiang Kai-shek. He was an important figure during the Sino-German cooperation to reform the Chinese army. In 1938, Germany ended its support for China under pressure from Japan, and Falkenhausen was forced to return home. Back in Europe, he later became the head of the military government of Belgium from 1940 to 1944 during its German occupation.

== Early life and military career ==
Alexander von Falkenhausen was born at Blumenthal, near Neisse (now Nysa, Poland) in the Prussian province of Silesia, one of seven children of Baron Alexander von Falkenhausen (1844–1909) and his wife, Elisabeth. He attended a Gymnasium in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland) and then the cadet school at Wahlstatt (now Legnickie Pole). In his youth, Falkenhausen showed an interest in Eastern Asia and its societies. He travelled and studied in Japan, northern China, Korea and Indochina from 1909 to 1911.

In 1897 he was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the 91st Oldenburg Infantry Regiment of the Imperial German Army, taking part in quelling the Boxer Rebellion, and served as a military attaché in Japan from 1900 up until the First World War. He was awarded the prestigious Pour le Mérite award while serving with the Ottoman Army in Palestine. After the war, he remained in the Reichswehr (German Army) and in 1927 was appointed to head the Dresden Infantry School.

== Adviser to Chiang Kai-shek ==

In 1930, Falkenhausen retired from the service. In 1934, he went to China to join the German military advisors to the Chinese army. He became military advisor to Chiang Kai-shek, the leader of the Republic of China. Von Falkenhausen was responsible for most of the military training of the army. Both had studied abroad in Japan, and their conversations were conducted directly in Japanese. They said that their friendship deepened because they did not use an interpreter.The original plans by von Seeckt called for a drastic reduction of the Chinese army to 60 elite divisions modeled on the Wehrmacht. This would require disbanding some of the forces of regional leaders, and the question of which factions&#x27; troops would be axed remained a problem.

On 30 June 1934 Alexander&#x27;s brother Hans Joachim von Falkenhausen, SA-&quot;Oberführer&quot; and Chief of staff to SA-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; Georg von Detten, was killed by the SS in the Night of the Long Knives. 

The Germans trained 80,000 Chinese troops, in eight divisions, which formed the elite of Chiang&#x27;s army. However, China was not ready to face Japan on equal terms. Chiang&#x27;s decision to commit all of his new divisions in the Battle of Shanghai, despite objections from his own staff officers and von Falkenhausen, would cost him one-third of his best troops. Chiang switched his strategy to preserve strength for the eventual Chinese Civil War.

Von Falkenhausen recommended that Chiang fight a war of attrition as Falkenhausen calculated that Japan could not win a long-term war. He suggested that Chiang should hold the Yellow River line, and not attack until later in the war. Also, Chiang should give up a number of provinces in northern China including Shandong. He also recommended construction of fortifications at strategically important locations to slow the Japanese advance. Falkenhausen also advised the Chinese to establish a number of guerrilla operations behind Japanese lines.

In 1937, Nazi Germany allied with the Empire of Japan which was fighting the Second Sino-Japanese War with China. As a goodwill gesture to Japan, Germany recognized the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo, withdrew German support from China and forced Falkenhausen to resign by threatening to have his family in Germany punished for disloyalty. After a goodbye dinner party with Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s family, Falkenhausen promised that he would never reveal any of the battle plans he had devised to the Japanese.

According to some sources (especially from Communist Chinese ones in the late 1930s), Falkenhausen kept in contact with Chiang Kai-shek and occasionally sent European luxury items and food to him, the Chiang household, and his officers. On his 72nd birthday in 1950, Falkenhausen received a $12,000 cheque from Chiang Kai-shek as a birthday gift and a personal note declaring him a &quot;Friend of China&quot;.
On Falkenhausen&#x27;s 80th birthday in 1958, Wang Xiaoxi, the Nationalist Chinese ambassador to Belgium, awarded him the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred Tripod for his contributions in defending China.

== Military governor for Belgium ==
Recalled to active duty in 1938, Falkenhausen served as an infantry general on the Western Front, until he was appointed military governor of Belgium in May 1940, the same post his uncle Ludwig von Falkenhausen held 23 years prior during the First World War. Throughout his period of administration, Falkenhausen had co-operated with both Eggert Reeder and Dr. Werner Best, to try to apply the rules of the Hague Convention in their region, often against the wishes and instructions of their Wehrmacht and SS superiors.

Though opposed to Nazi extremism towards the Jewish population, he yielded to pressure from Reinhard Heydrich&#x27;s RSHA, leading in June 1942 to the deportation of 28,900 Jews. His deputy for economic affairs, Eggert Reeder, was in charge of the destruction of &quot;Jewish influence&quot; in the Belgian economy, leading to mass unemployment of Jewish workers, especially in the diamond business. While implementation of economic policy led to mass unemployment of Belgian Jewish workers, Reeder&#x27;s efforts preserved existing national administrative structures and business relations within Belgium and northern France during the German occupation. 2,250 of these unemployed Belgian Jews were sent to forced labor camps in Northern France, in order to build the Atlantic Wall for Organisation Todt.

To ensure that all the Belgian people co-operated in the German occupation, Reeder negotiated an agreement to allow native Belgian Jews to remain in Belgium. Part of this was the non-enforcement of the Reich Security Main Office order for all Jews to be marked by wearing a yellow Star of David at all times, until Helmut Knochen&#x27;s conference in Paris on 14 March 1942.

He intervened twice to prevent the execution of Belgians for resistance against the Germans, at the request of Qian Xiuling, a Chinese-Belgian woman whose elder cousin, Lieutenant General Qian Zhuolun, was a good friend of Falkenhausen during his time in China and in the post-war trial Qian Xiuling spoke in his defense, saying: &quot;Nothing I did could have been accomplished without General von Falkenhausen&#x27;s help. Even though he might not deserve an award, neither should he be put on trial, definitely not.&quot;

== Bomb plot ==
Falkenhausen was a close friend of the anti-Hitler conspirators, Carl Friedrich Goerdeler and Field Marshal Erwin von Witzleben and soon came to detest Adolf Hitler and the Nazi regime. He offered his support to Witzleben for a planned coup d&#x27;état against Hitler, but did not take any part in the coup. After the failure of the 20 July Plot to kill Hitler in 1944, Falkenhausen was relieved of his command and later arrested. Falkenhausen spent the rest of the war being transferred from one concentration camp to another. In late April 1945 he was transferred to Tyrol with about 140 other prominent inmates of the Dachau concentration camp.

The SS fled, leaving the prisoners behind and he was captured by the Fifth U.S. Army on 5 May 1945.

== Trial and pardon ==
Falkenhausen and Reeder were sent to Belgium for trial in 1948, where they were held on remand for three years. A trial for their role in the deportation of Jews from Belgium but not for their deaths in Auschwitz, began in Brussels on 9 March 1951 and they were defended by the lawyer Ernst Achenbach.

During the trial, Falkenhausen was vouched for by Qian Xiuling, former French Prime Minister Léon Blum and a number of Belgian Jews, who gave evidence that Falkenhausen and Reeder had tried to save Belgian and Jewish lives. Nevertheless, on 9 July 1951 they were convicted and sentenced to twelve years hard labour in Germany. On their return to West Germany three weeks after the end of the trial, having served one third of their sentence, as required by Belgian law, they were pardoned by Chancellor Konrad Adenauer.

== Later life ==

On return to Germany, he first lived near the then inner German border on the estate of his friend Franz von Papen near Grüsselbach and then, fearing kidnapping by East German agents, in Nassau an der Lahn.

In 1950, Falkenhausen became a widower; in 1960 he married his second wife, Cécile Vent (1906–1977), who had been a Belgian resistance fighter. He had met her during his imprisonment in 1948, when Vent was a member of the administrative commission of the prisons of Verviers.

<text>The coat of arms of Yukon is the heraldic symbol representing the Canadian territory of Yukon. The arms was commissioned by the federal Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and designed by well-known heraldry expert Alan Beddoe in the early 1950s. It was officially approved by Queen Elizabeth II in 1956.

The lower part of the shield represents Yukon&#x27;s mountains, with the gold disks (called &quot;bezants,&quot; a medieval gold coin) representing the territory&#x27;s mineral resources and its birth in the Klondike Gold Rush. The two white wavy lines represent the territory&#x27;s rivers.

The red cross in chief represents England. The roundel surmounting it is in a pattern called vair (i.e. squirrel fur), representing the territory&#x27;s wealth of fur-bearing animals.

The crest is an Alaskan Malamute dog standing on a mound of snow.

==Blazon==
Shield: &quot;Azure, on a pallet wavy Argent, a like pallet of the field, issuant from base two piles reversed Gules, fimbriated also Argent, each charged with two bezants in pale, on a chief Argent a cross Gules, surmounted of a roundel vair.&quot;

<text>Bolivia is a unitary state consisting of nine [[department (administrative division)|departments]] (). Departments are the primary subdivisions of Bolivia, and possess certain rights under the Constitution of Bolivia. Each department is represented in the Plurinational Legislative Assembly—a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. Each department is represented by four Senators, while Deputies are awarded to each department in proportion to their total population.

Out of the nine departments, La Paz was originally the most populous, with 2,706,351 inhabitants as of 2012 but the far eastern department of Santa Cruz has since surpassed it by 2020; Santa Cruz also claims the title as the largest, encompassing .

<doc id="670493" wikidata="Q1631888" url="?curid=670493" title="Parishes of Barbados">
<text>The country of Barbados is divided into sub-regions known as parishes.

==Terminology==
They are legally styled as the &quot;Parish of (&quot;parish name&quot;)&quot; as opposed to the American naming convention with &quot;Parish&quot; coming after the name. The use of the term &quot;parish&quot; derives from the island&#x27;s religious Anglican history under the Church of England.

==History==
The system of parish churches was originally based on the system of the Church of England and was the visible expression forming the basis of the parliamentary representation in Barbados. The differing size and shape of each parish were primarily influenced by the large plantation estates of cotton, sugar cane and tobacco that existed during the colonial years of Barbados. As various chapels of ease were created during the 17th century across the island, some local churches were elevated to parish church status, leading to the formation of new parishes surrounding those freshly created vestries.

By 1629, the English settlers after landing at James Town formed six original parishes on the island which were:
*The Parish of Christ Church,
*The Parish of St. James,
*The Parish of St. Lucy,
*The Parish of St. Michael,
*The Parish of St. Peter, and
*The Parish of St. Thomas

By 1645, the land holding of Barbados increased and the shape of the original six was reconfigured giving way to an additional five parishes. Some prior churches of the state within the existing parishes were elevated to the level of parish church and as a consequence they formed new parishes around those new vestries:
*The Parish of St. Andrew,
*The Parish of St. George,
*The Parish of St. John,
*The Parish of St. Joseph, and
*The Parish of St. Philip.

Thus Barbados was converted into the current eleven parishes of today corresponding to the earlier church parishes. As was common under the British system, each parish had a single main parishional church (or cathedral in the case of Bridgetown having been elevated to city status), which acted as a sort of capital for each parish. The parishes each held their own local government councils until these were abolished in 1959, following a brief administrative districting experiment within Barbados until 1967.

==List==

Within the country, travel is unrestricted to everyone in moving about from parish to parish. With increasing urban sprawl and new construction projects across the country many neighbourhoods and even parishional border-lines today are ill-defined.

The eleven parishes are:

<doc id="670497" wikidata="Q603773" url="?curid=670497" title="Lecture">
<text>A lecture (from ) is an oral presentation intended to present information or teach people about a particular subject, for example by a university or college teacher. Lectures are used to convey critical information, history, background, theories, and equations. A politician&#x27;s speech, a minister&#x27;s sermon, or even a business person&#x27;s sales presentation may be similar in form to a lecture. Usually the lecturer will stand at the front of the room and recite information relevant to the lecture&#x27;s content.

Though lectures are much criticised as a teaching method, universities have not yet found practical alternative teaching methods for the large majority of their courses. Critics point out that lecturing is mainly a one-way method of communication that does not involve significant audience participation but relies upon passive learning. Therefore, lecturing is often contrasted to active learning. Lectures delivered by talented speakers can be highly stimulating; at the very least, lectures have survived in academia as a quick, cheap, and efficient way of introducing large numbers of students to a particular field of study.

Lectures have a significant role outside the classroom, as well. Academic and scientific awards routinely include a lecture as part of the honor, and academic conferences often center on &quot;keynote addresses&quot;, i.e., lectures. The public lecture has a long history in the sciences and in social movements. Union halls, for instance, historically have hosted numerous free and public lectures on a wide variety of matters. Similarly, churches, community centers, libraries, museums, and other organizations have hosted lectures in furtherance of their missions or their constituents&#x27; interests. Lectures represent a continuation of oral tradition in contrast to textual communication in books and other media. Lectures may be considered a type of grey literature.

== Etymology ==

The noun &quot;lecture&quot; dates from 14th century, meaning &quot;action of reading, that which is read,&quot; from the Latin &quot;lectus&quot;, pp. of &quot;legere&quot; &quot;to read.&quot; Its subsequent meaning as &quot;oral discourse on a given subject before an audience for purposes of instruction&quot; is from the 16th century. The verb &quot;to lecture&quot; is attested from 1590.
The noun &quot;lectern&quot; refers to the reading desk used by lecturers.

==History==
The practice in the medieval university was for the instructor to read from an original source to a class of students who took notes on the lecture. The reading from original sources evolved into the reading of glosses on an original and then more generally to lecture notes. Throughout much of history, the diffusion of knowledge via handwritten lecture notes was an essential element of academic life.
Even in the twentieth century, the lecture notes taken by students, or prepared by a scholar for a lecture, have sometimes achieved wide circulation (see, for example, the genesis of Ferdinand de Saussure&#x27;s &quot;Cours de linguistique générale&quot;). Many lecturers were, and still are, accustomed to simply reading their own notes from the lectern for exactly that purpose. Nevertheless, modern lectures generally incorporate additional activities, e.g. writing on a chalk-board, exercises, class questions and discussions, or student presentations.

The use of multimedia presentation software such as Microsoft PowerPoint has changed the form of lectures, e.g. video, graphics, websites, or prepared exercises may be included. Most commonly, however, only outlines composed of &quot;bullet points&quot; are presented. Critics such as Edward Tufte contend that this style of lecture bombards the audience with unnecessary and possibly distracting or confusing graphics.

A modified lecture format, generally presented in 5 to 15 minute short segments, is now commonly presented as video, for example in massive open online courses (MOOCs) or in programs such as the Khan Academy.

==Research==

Bligh, in &quot;What&#x27;s the Use of Lectures?&quot;, argues that lectures &quot;represent a conception of education in which teachers who know give knowledge to students who do not and are therefore supposed to have nothing worth contributing.&quot; Based on his review of numerous studies, he concludes that lecturing is as effective, but not more effective, as any other teaching method in transmitting information. Nevertheless, lecturing is not the most effective method for promoting student thought, changing attitudes, or teaching behavioral skills.
Bligh summarises research on memory to show the significance of the meaningfulness of material on retention (Marks and Miller 1964) and the importance of immediate rehearsal of information (Bassey 1968). He relates his own research on arousal during lectures to suggest a decrement in attention during the first 25 minutes. Lloyd (1968) and Scerbo et al. (1992) showed that students take less and less notes as lectures proceed. Bligh shows that after a short break filled by buzz group discussion, attention will recover somewhat. 
The largest section of Bligh&#x27;s book is devoted to lecturing technique, particularly the organisation of lectures, how to make a point, the effectiveness of taking notes, the use of handouts, and ways of obtaining feedback.
Early editions of the book contained a reply paid evaluation card. This research showed that the section on alternative teaching methods within lectures was the most highly praised.

The conception of the lecture as needing to be a didactic event has been challenged by Meltzer and Manivannan (2002) and Sandry (2005) who maintain that lectures can involve active learning. However, Elliot (2005) sees difficulties in the encouragement of active learning with phenomena such as social loafing and evaluation apprehension causing audience members to be reluctant to participate. A possible solution to the encouragement of audience involvement in lectures is the use of an audience response system which allows audience members to participate anonymously. 

Shoufan (2020) argues that with a proper usage of learning technology, the lecture can be omitted and completely replaced by learning activities. 

===Advantages===
The effectiveness of traditional lecture is and has been debated. Some advantages of lecturing include: quick exposure to new material, greater teacher control in the classroom, an engaging format, which may complement and clarify course material, and facilitating large-class communication. Lecturing also permits the dissemination of unpublished or not readily available material. Another advantage would be for the lecturer to attract students. A vivid personality with a kind and respectful attitude in the classroom may help to recruit prospective Master and PhD students for a lecturer&#x27;s own academic research.

===Disadvantages===
There has been much debate as to whether or not lecturing actually improves student learning in the classroom. Commonly cited disadvantages of lecture include: placing students in a passive (rather than an active) role, encouraging one-way communication, requiring significant out-of-class time for students to engage with the material, and requiring the speaker to possess effective speaking skills.

The criticisms of lectures are often summarized by a quote generally misattributed to Mark Twain:
==Other forms==

While lecturing is generally accepted as an effective form of instruction, there have been some prominent educators who have succeeded without the help of lectures.
Many university courses relying on lectures supplement them with smaller discussion sections, tutorials, or laboratory experiment sessions as a means of further actively involving students. Often these supplemental sections are led by graduate students, tutors, teaching assistants, or teaching fellows rather than senior faculty. Those other forms of academic teaching include discussion (recitation if conducted by a teaching assistant), seminars, workshops, observation, practical application, case examples/case study, experiential learning/active learning, computer-based instruction, and tutorials. 
In schools, the prevalent mode of student-teacher interaction is lessons.

The term &quot;parlor lecture&quot; gained currency throughout the British Commonwealth of Nations and the United States of America during the mid-19th century. It referred to the custom of inviting noted speakers to deliver private lectures, which were typically hosted in the parlors of wealthy and socially influential families.

<text>Landscape archaeology, previously known as total archaeology is a sub-discipline of archaeology and archaeological theory. It studies the ways in which people in the past constructed and used the environment around them. It is also known as archaeogeography (from the Greek &quot;ancient&quot;, and &quot;earth study&quot;). Landscape archaeology is inherently multidisciplinary in its approach to the study of culture, and is used by pre-historical, classic, and historic archaeologists. The key feature that distinguishes landscape archaeology from other archaeological approaches to sites is that there is an explicit emphasis on the sites&#x27; relationships between material culture, human alteration of land/cultural modifications to landscape, and the natural environment. The study of landscape archaeology (also sometimes referred to as the archaeology of the cultural landscape) has evolved to include how landscapes were used to create and reinforce social inequality and to announce one&#x27;s social status to the community at large. The field includes with the dynamics of geohistorical objects, such as roads, walls, boundaries, trees, and land divisions.

==Introduction==
Landscape generally refers to both natural environments and environments constructed by human beings. Natural landscapes are considered to be environments that have not been altered by humans in any shape or form. Cultural landscapes, on the other hand, are environments that have been altered in some manner by people (including temporary structures and places, such as campsites, that are created by human beings). Among archaeologists, the term landscape can refer to the meanings and alterations people mark onto their surroundings. As such, landscape archaeology is often employed to study the human use of land over extensive periods of time.

Landscape archaeology can be summed up by Nicole Branton&#x27;s statement: 
:&quot;the landscapes in landscape archaeology may be as small as a single household or garden or as large as an empire&quot;, and &quot;although resource exploitation, class, and power are frequent topics of landscape archaeology, landscape approaches are concerned with spatial, not necessarily ecological or economic, relationships. While similar to settlement archaeology and ecological archaeology, landscape approaches model places and space as dynamic participants in past behavior, not merely setting (affecting human action), or artifact (affected by human action)&quot;.

The term space has commonly been used in place of cultural landscape to describe landscapes that are &quot;produced or mediated by human behavior to elicit certain behaviors&quot;. Defined in this manner, archaeologists, such as Delle, have theorized space as composed of three components: the material, social, and cognitive. Material space is any space that is created by people either through physical means or through the establishment of definitions, descriptions and rules of what a space is reserved for and how it should be used (Delle 1998:38). Social space is what dictates a person&#x27;s relationship with both others and the material space (Delle 1998:39). Social space is how one uses their material space to interact with others and navigate throughout their world. Cognitive space is how people comprehend their social and material spaces—it is how people understand the world around them and identify appropriate ways of conducting themselves in the many different environments they may occupy (Delle 1998:38-9). Alternatively, the terms constructed, conceptualized, and ideational have been used to describe: the constructed ways in which people engage with their environments, meanings and interactions people place onto specific landscapes, and imagined and emotional perspectives individuals place with their landscapes.

==Analysis of landscapes==
Many methods used to analyze archaeological sites are relevant to the analysis of landscapes. The archaeology of landscapes incorporates multiple research methods into its analysis in order to ensure that multiple sources of information are gathered; allowing for a sound interpretation of the site in question. These methods include pollen analysis, Geographic Information Systems, soil sampling, faunal analysis, ground penetrating radar, archival data (including maps and census data), and of course archaeological excavation methods. Pollen, soil, faunal, and floral analysis allows the archaeologist to understand the natural vegetation of an area, vegetation that was actively grown by area settlers, and the animal life that also lived in the area. An understanding of the plant and animal life specific to an area can lead to, for example, an analysis of the types of food available to members of the community, an understanding of the actual diet typical for a subset of a population, and site and skeletal dating. If landscape reconstruction and preservation, in particular, is a goal of an archaeological research project, pollen and soil analysis can aide in landscape archaeology to accurately interpret and reconstruct landscapes of the past (Schoenwetter pg 278).

Advances in survey technology have permitted the rapid and accurate analysis of wide areas, making the process an efficient way of learning more about the historic environment. Global Positioning System, remote sensing, archaeological geophysics, Total stations and digital photography, as well as GIS, have helped reduce the time and cost involved in such work.

* Geographic Information Systems
:Geographic Information Systems, commonly referred to as GIS, provides a way in which archaeologists can visually represent archaeological data, and can be done in two ways: data visualization and representative visualization. For example, researchers can create planar maps from orthophotos, then add multiple layers of historical data (such as changing topology or the locations of artificial structures) on the same map, allowing them to better see the duration and durability of past and present forms within a landscape.

:Viewshed Analysis has aided in the archaeologist&#x27;s ability to study behavioral relationships between humans, their landscape, and material culture, in order to study migration, settlement patterns, and agency. Viewshed analysis also provides means with which archaeologists can recreate through an ability to recreate the line of sights possible from one point on a landscape and to situate a person within a defined landscape.

*Excavation
:Site excavation has the potential to uncover building methods, such as the findings of postholes (which can mark the previous existence of fence lines or other site boundaries), timber, stones, and/or brick that marks the existence of man-made structures.

:Archaeological features often leave earthworks – signs of some type of modification to the natural environment that often appear as cropmarks, soil marks, or even as plough marks in fields that, if historical, can indicate cultivation methods of the past, or, particularly if more recent, can lift archaeological material to the surface and, therefore, ruin the stratigraphic layering of materials from youngest to oldest). Features can be discovered by archaeologists both through excavation and through field survey.
*Archival Data is used by any archaeologists that have any written texts available to them, and is used in a multiple number of ways, depending on the research project and objective of the research and the data available in the archives. Archives are often employed to confirm archaeological findings, to understand the construction of a site, settlement patterns.
* Pollen Analysis
:Pollen analysis has allowed archaeologists to analyze vegetation selectively cultivated by area residents, the &quot;native vegetation&quot; of a particular area, and allow archaeologists to map out land use over time (which can be ascertained from weeds). But collecting a suitable sample is not all that easy. Failure to collect a suitable sample can be due in part to not sampling from areas where suitable pollen samples can be gathered (e.g. lakes and bogs, sites that were sufficiently exposed to air-borne pollen, sites that had both a long exposure to air and are deeply buried into the ground), or because pollen is vulnerable to destruction by the oxidation process or soil microbes such as bacteria and fungi, it negatively impacts an archaeologist&#x27;s ability to collect a suitable pollen sample.

:Gerald K. Kelso and Mary C. Beaudry demonstrate how &quot;…changes in the complex mosaic of microenvironments in metropolitan situations are sensitively recorded in the pollen contributions of weedy taxa&quot;. Arboreal pollen indicates regional vegetation, while non-arboreal indicates local vegetation. Both arboreal and non-arboreal pollen can be gathered and used in archaeological studies to support documentary and archaeological evidence of changes in land use—initial settlement, resettlement of area by other groups, and decline and abandonment of area—for example non-arboreal pollen can indicate the replacement of vegetation native to a region within the United States by vegetation native to places in Europe, or to the clearance of large areas that would be expected to make way for cities and towns.

==Sociological aspects of landscape archaeology==

Within the discipline of historical archaeology, specifically within the United States, landscape archaeology initially gained prominence with efforts to preserve the homes and gardens of prominent North American figures (see George Washington&#x27;s Mount Vernon and Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s Monticello), the reconstruction of early colonial settlements (see Colonial Williamsburg) and the analysis of gardens (see Annapolis). Archaeologists studying the aforementioned, and other colonial sites throughout the United States, have excavated the gardens of wealthy men and women in order to reconstruct and ascertain the function of these gardens in colonial life. Scholars analyzing the colonial gardens have noticed that gardens were designed in a neat and orderly fashion, displaying symmetry and inspired by Baroque and Renaissance styles (this style is often described as indicative of a &quot;Georgian Worldview&quot; that became popular during the 17th and 18th centuries). Many interpretations have been advanced to explain the function of these gardens. Beginning in the mid-1700s, wealthy elites began to construct large, stately homes and neat, ordered gardens with the guise of mapping superiority and exclusive knowledge onto the landscape. Although the Baroque and Renaissance styles were out of date by the time elites in the United States employed them, this was intentionally done to communicate a knowledge and appreciation of British history that few within the community would have access to. Archaeologists have concluded that the symmetrical, geometric, designs of garden-scapes adopted by colonists in the mid eighteenth to nineteenth centuries made use of &quot;...converging and diverging lines of sight to manipulate the relationship between distance and focal point&quot;, making objects appear larger or further away than they really were. These optical illusions functioned to transform the home into a readily identifiable status symbol, and to mark the owners and occupants of these homes as socially distinct from others within the colonial community. Stately homes and gardens constructed by the colonial elite also served to assert authority and to naturalize a social hierarchy onto the colonial landscape. Such analysis and interpretations are neo-marxist in its approach to the understanding and interpreting landscapes of the past.

Stephen A. Mrozwoski has extended the conclusions drawn from the archaeological analysis of elite homes and pleasure gardens into the analysis of the developing middle and working class landscapes and ideologies among industrial communities, noting &quot;in the urban context economies of scale realized through spatial practice also contributed to a social landscape that between the eighteenth and early twentieth centuries was increasingly constructed along class lines&quot; and demonstrate the ways in which the elite constructed their industrial landscapes that worked to restrict perceived amoral behaviors (e.g. drinking, smoking) and to maintain an orderly landscape. The landscape also provided an area where &quot;values like orderliness, gentility, and abstinence were important elements of a middle-class culture that, while subject to variability, was nevertheless part of daily existence.&quot;

Historical archaeologists have incorporated Foucauldian theories into the understanding of plantation landscapes. On plantation sites throughout the Americas, plantation owners utilized surveillance methods to restrict the behaviors of the enslaved populations. James A. Delle notes that surveillance was often incorporated into the plantation landscape, noting &quot;the planter class who designed the estate landscapes actively constructed plantation spaces…as an active part of their strategy of social control&quot; and power. This was largely done through architectural techniques such as incorporating positions where panoptic views can be achieved into the construction of planters and/or overseers homes or by constructing slave villages that were in the plain view or line of sight of the homes of the overseer and/or plantation owner.

Archaeologists have pointed out that, although home spaces are generally considered to have become increasingly gendered, it is erroneous to assume that only women occupied the private (home) sphere and men the public. For more extensive information on this topic, see Household Archaeology.

Barbara Voss has done extensive archaeological work to reveal how ideas about gender, sexuality, marriage, and ethnic/racial intermarriage were mapped onto the landscape of Spanish Colonial mission sites in California (El Presidio de San Francisco). Voss&#x27; interpretations reveal the lived trauma that is often concealed by popular, romanticized, narratives of relationships established through colonial contact between indigenous peoples and Spanish colonizers The mission landscape became physical and conceptualized space where two genders (male/female) and heterosexuality were to be explicitly expressed and reinforced.

Landscape Archaeology has been useful in the analysis of cultural identities that developed among social and racial groups. It has been argued that the existence and continued use of yard spaces among Black Americans (along with other African-derived practices observed in the Americas) is proof of a distinct, new world, cultural identity. One feature that appears to be widespread throughout the African diaspora is the significant importance of yard spaces in the everyday lives of African-Americans. Sidney W. Mintz, in describing the &quot;house-and-yard pattern&quot; among African-American peasants residing in the Caribbean, explains &quot;…the house, particularly among poorer peasants, is not important in itself as a material representation (i.e. material culture/artifacts) of the domestic group or family&quot;. Mintz further states that while the house &quot;…is usually used mainly for sleeping and for storing clothing and other articles of personal value&quot; the yard is where &quot;…children play, the washing is done, the family relaxes, and friends are entertained&quot;.

Richard Westmacott, Barbara J. Heath and Amber Bennett have echoed Mintz&#x27;s statements about the use of yards among African-Americans in their accounts of present day and past African-American communities. Richard Westmacott provides an extensive ethnographic account of the role gardens and yards play in the lives of African Americans in the southern region of the United States in his book African-American Gardens and Yards in the Rural South. Westmacott provides a clear definition of the yard, defining it as a place where leisure activities and artistic expression often take place Similarly, Heath and Bennett describe the yard as a space in which &quot;…food production and preparation, care and maintenance of animals, domestic chores, storage, recreation, and aesthetic enjoyment&quot; often occur at. The use of the yard as an important and integral aspect of a home appears to be an element that many west African cultures hold, which indicates that the function of the yard within African-American households may be a facet of west African cultures that was maintained in the New World, as well as a cultural aspect that aided in the development of African American identities in the Americas.

Similarly, Mrozowski&#x27;s study of rear yards associated with the Boott Mill boardinghouses and tenements that housed workers revealed that these yards mainly served practical functions and were not primarily used to grow foodstuffs, and may not have served an integral part in the daily lives of the low-wage workers hired (99–100). Mrozowski also argues that yards also represented social distance and distinctiveness between socio-economic classes of people, due to the particular placement, use, and overall function. &quot;The result was a landscape that created social distance between the agents and the workers who lived only a few feet away. It also represents a significant transformation in the urban space. The ornamental yards of the agent&#x27;s house and overseers&#x27; block signal an important shift in the type of urban space being produced and the manner in which it was utilized.&quot;

== History of the field ==
Landscape archaeology has its origins in &quot;total archaeology&quot;, a term used by Christopher Taylor in 1974 to describe an approach which incorporated wider disciplines, such as folklore, historical map analysis and geology, alongside excavation in the understanding of archaeological sites. In his excavations of the Neolithic enclosure at Great Wilbraham, David Clarke defined &quot;total archaeology&quot; as the incorporation of a full range of interdisciplinary specialists and the incorporation of scientific methods, such as magnetometry and pollen analysis, in the reconstruction of a site. Total archaeology aimed to understand sites in their contexts, studying landscapes as a whole and incorporating methods traditionally used by historians, geographers, geologists and anthropologists. The term &quot;landscape archaeology&quot; was first used in a book title, as a replacement for &quot;total archaeology&quot;, in 1974, by Mick Aston and Trevor Rowley. 

The spatial archaeology trend was launched by Ian Hodder in 1976. It is an archaeological trend, such as ethnoarchaeology, cognitive archaeology and other archaeological approaches. Spatial archaeology was defined by Clarke in 1977. He pointed out three analysis levels: macro, micro and semi-micro (Clarke 1977: 11–15). This trend analyses the interaction between nature and culture.

Human geography uses location analysis to define models for the understanding of the territorial organisation. The archaeologists Higgs and Vita-Finzi began to apply Site Catchment Analysis (SCA) in 1970s. They proposed a new approach to know how people settled in prehistoric societies. They analysed economic resources with tools taken from Human Geography, these resources were 5–10 km from the archaeological sites. Some years later, in the 1970s, spatial archaeology was created, based on the use of several tools taken from 1960s English Human Geography that was focus on the study of location interdependence. Some archaeologists use these geographical techniques (Hodder &amp; Orton 1976; Hodder 1977, 1978; Clarke 1977). But these techniques were only used in isolated contexts. They did not fully constitute an archaeological method and lacked a theoretical basis.

In the 1980s some archaeologists began to criticize the classical view of Site Catchment Analysis (De Carlos 1988). The reason was related to the lack of a general method to study archaeological territory. In 1989, Javier de Carlos said that archaeology was only able to apply geographical techniques without being able to use a procedure integrated in a method.

== Centers of research ==

Archaeogeography is taught in France and Portugal. A Masters degree in Archaeology and Environment is given by the University of Paris I. Archaeogeography is also included in the University of Coimbra&#x27;s curricula of Centro de Estudos de Arqueologia, Artes e Ciências do Património.

<text>[[District|Districts]] () are the principal administrative divisions of Brunei. The country is divided into four districts, namely Brunei-Muara, Belait, Tutong and Temburong. Temburong is an exclave; it is physically separated from the three other districts by the Brunei Bay and Malaysian state of Sarawak. Each district has a town as its administrative and main economic centre, with the exception of Brunei-Muara, where the principal centre is Bandar Seri Begawan, a city and the country&#x27;s capital.

== History ==
The country previously had six districts, namely Brunei, Muara, Limau Manis (also known as Ulu Brunei), Tutong, Belait and Temburong. In 1908 Brunei and Limau Manis were merged, and in 1938 the districts were restructured to form the present-day four districts.

== Administration ==
Each district is administered by a District Office (), where District Offices are government departments under the Ministry of Home Affairs. The head of each department is a District Officer () and appointed by the government.

A district is further divided into mukims, and subsequently each mukim consists of several villages (). Each District Office manages the mukims and villages within its district.

<doc id="670507" wikidata="Q204829" url="?curid=670507" title="Courts of the Republic of Ireland">
<text>The Courts of Ireland consist of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, the High Court, the Circuit Court, the District Court and the Special Criminal Court. With the exception of the Special Criminal Court, all courts exercise both civil and criminal jurisdiction, although when the High Court is exercising its criminal jurisdiction it is known as the Central Criminal Court.

The courts apply the laws of Ireland. There are four sources of law in Ireland: the Constitution, European Union law, statute law and the common law. Under the Constitution, trials for serious offences must usually be held before a jury. Except in exceptional circumstances, court hearings must occur in public. The High Court, the Court of Appeal, and the Supreme Court have authority, by means of judicial review, to determine the compatibility of the common law and statute law with the Constitution. Similarly, the courts may determine the compatibility of the common law with statute law.

==Introduction==
The current system of courts is provided for in Article 34 of the Constitution of Ireland of 1937. However, it was not until the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Act 1961 became law that this system took effect. Between 1937 and 1961 the courts provided for by the Constitution of the Irish Free State and the Courts of Justice Act 1924 continued their work under the Transitory Provisions of the Constitution of 1937, in which Articles 34 to 37 deal with the administration of justice generally.

The Courts Service Act 1998 created the Courts Service to manage the courts and associated property, and provide assistance and facilities to their users, including judges. The Courts Service also provides information to the public. The Board of the Courts Service, which oversees policy formulation and implementation, is headed by a chief executive officer. Judges of the courts are independent of the service in their judicial functions and are in that capacity paid by the state and not the service.

==The courts==
===Superior courts===
The Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, and the High Court are provided for in the Constitution. The Supreme Court of Ireland is defined as the Court of Final Appeal, but usually hears appeals only on points of law. Its decisions as to the interpretation of the Constitution and the law are final. The Court of Appeal and the High Court also have authority to interpret the Constitution. The High Court also tries the most serious criminal and civil cases, and hears certain appeals from lower courts. When the high court sits as a criminal court it is called the Central Criminal Court and sits with a jury.

The High Court includes a Commercial Court division that &quot;deals with all types of business dispute including breach of contract, tort, property, trust and probate, IT disputes, judicial review, corporate mergers, global restructuring, insurance portfolio transfers, International Swaps and Derivatives or other investment disputes, and intellectual property disputes.&quot;  

The Court of Appeal is the newest of the superior courts having been established in 2014. It took over the former appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court (in civil appeals from the High Court), and the jurisdiction of the former Court of Criminal Appeal (in criminal appeals from the High Court and the Circuit Court).

===Lower courts===
The Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, and the High Court are the only courts specifically required by the Constitution. Other courts are established by law. Beneath the superior courts are the Circuit Court and the District Court. The Circuit Court deals with matters that must be tried before a jury. The District Court deals only with minor matters that may be tried summarily.

The Constitution provides for only two institutions in which a serious crime may be tried in the absence of a jury: a military tribunal, and a special court established by law to try serious offences whenever this is considered to be in the interests of justice or public order. Such a court has been established in the form of the Special Criminal Court, which has been used to try those accused of being members of paramilitary organisations such as the Provisional IRA, or of leading organised crime.

===Family Court===
The Family Court is a division of the District, Circuit and High Courts that deals with family law matters. It has historically been the subject of criticisms, which have led to its procedures being included in the Third Programme for Law Reform, as well as the attempted implementation of new procedures. According to Mark Garrett, director general of Ireland&#x27;s Law Society, these reforms began to take place in the 1970s. One of the Reform&#x27;s principal aims is the establishment of a Family District Court, a Family Circuit Court, and a Family High Court as divisions of the existing District Court, Circuit Court and High Court. In November 2022, Justice Minister Helen McEntee produced the Family Courts Bill 2022, which sought to establish a Family Law Court complex at Hammond Lane in Dublin&#x27;s legal quarter. In the following year, Justice Minister Simon Harris hoped that the addition of 24 judges would accelerate this process.

In principle, all hearings are and reporting is anonymous, restricted and issued quarterly by a single journalist.

==Judges==

===Appointment===
Judges are appointed by the President of Ireland, acting on the binding advice of the Government. The Government acts on the advice of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board who submit a list of seven recommended candidates. However the Government is not bound to follow the advice of the Board and may decide to appoint other qualified individuals. The Board advertises vacant positions but does not seek out candidates or conduct interviews.

Traditionally Superior and Circuit Court judges were barristers before being appointed to the bench, while District Court judges were solicitors. Michael White became the first solicitor to be appointed to the Circuit Court in 1996 and Michael Peart became the first solicitor to appointed to the High Court in 2002. White was made a High Court judge in 2011.

Judicial appointments are frequently thought to be politically motivated. In an interview in the Autumn 2012 edition of &quot;The Parchment&quot;, Peter Kelly, head of the Commercial Court and head of the Association of Judges of Ireland said the appointments to the Supreme Court were &quot;purely political&quot;. He went on to say the creation of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board (JAAB) in 1996 &quot;was done to create the semblance of independence as to how judges were appointed&quot; but &quot;the JAAB by common consent, doesn&#x27;t really work&quot;. He continued &quot;We all know of cases of people who would be excellent judicial appointments and are passed over in favour of people who are not so well qualified.&quot; He called for an independent body to appoint judges. In 2015 Mr Justice Kelly was appointed by the government as President of the High Court.

===Remuneration===
The Constitution originally mandated that judicial salaries could not be reduced as long as they remain in office. However, in 2011 the Twenty-ninth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland inserted a clause allowing which provides that:

:&quot;Where, before or after the enactment of this section, reductions have been or are made by law to the remuneration of persons belonging to classes of persons whose remuneration is paid out of public money and such law states that those reductions are in the public interest, provision may also be made by law to make proportionate reductions to the remuneration of judges.&quot;

In &quot;O&#x27;Byrne v Minister for Finance&quot; (1959), the Supreme Court had previously found that an increase in income tax which reduced judicial pay did not violate the constitutional prohibition on the reduction of judicial pay.

===Removal and resignation===
The procedure for removing a judge of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, or the High Court from office is specified in the Constitution, but by law the same mechanism applies to judges of the lower courts. A judge may be removed from office only for &quot;stated misbehaviour or incapacity&quot; and only if a joint resolution is adopted by both houses of the Oireachtas. After such a resolution is approved the judge is dismissed by the President. No judge has been removed from office since the foundation of the state in 1922.

In 1999 then Chief Justice Hamilton reported on the interventions of two judges, Justice Hugh O&#x27;Flaherty of the Supreme Court and Justice Cyril Kelly of the High Court, in the early release of Philip Sheedy, who had been convicted of causing death by dangerous driving. The Chief Justice described their actions as inappropriate and unwise. Following strong political reaction, and facing an Oireachtas debate on the report and a request by the executive to resign, both judges resigned. In their resignation statements they said they had done nothing wrong, but were resigning &quot;to restore faith in the judicial system&quot;.

In 2004 a motion to impeach a Circuit Court judge, Brian Curtin, was launched in the Dáil, the first time such a move has been made. This followed strong public reaction to his acquittal on charges of possession of child pornography, due to evidence seized by gardaí being ruled inadmissible, and the judge&#x27;s refusal of a Government request to resign. The Dáil established a joint committee to consider the evidence and report to the Dáil, a process that was upheld by the Supreme Court following a challenge by the judge. In November 2006, facing questioning by the committee, Judge Curtin resigned on health grounds, ending the impeachment process.

===First judge convicted of a serious crime===
On 20 November 2012, District Court judge Heather Perrin became the first judge in the history of Ireland to be convicted of a serious criminal offence. The jury found her guilty of deception by unanimous decision, the crime being committed while she was still a practising solicitor, a month before she was appointed to the judiciary. She subsequently resigned as a judge.

<doc id="670510" wikidata="Q1356704" url="?curid=670510" title="Pump-jet">
<text>A pump-jet, hydrojet, or water jet is a marine system that produces a jet of water for propulsion. The mechanical arrangement may be a ducted propeller (axial-flow pump), a centrifugal pump, or a mixed flow pump which is a combination of both centrifugal and axial designs. The design also incorporates an intake to provide water to the pump and a nozzle to direct the flow of water out of the pump.

== Design ==

A pump-jet works by having an intake (usually at the bottom of the hull) that allows water to pass underneath the vessel into the engines. Water enters the pump through this inlet. The pump can be of a centrifugal design for high speeds, or an axial flow pump for low to medium speeds. The water pressure inside the inlet is increased by the pump and forced backwards through a nozzle. With the use of a &quot;reversing bucket&quot;, reverse thrust can also be achieved for faring backwards, quickly and without the need to change gear or adjust engine thrust. The reversing bucket can also be used to help slow the ship down when braking. This feature is the main reason pump jets are so maneuverable.

The nozzle also provides the steering of the pump-jets. Plates, similar to rudders, can be attached to the nozzle in order to redirect the water flow port and starboard. In a way, this is similar to the principles of air &quot;thrust vectoring&quot;, a technique which has long been used in launch vehicles (rockets and missiles) then later in military jet-powered aircraft. This provides pumpjet-powered ships with superior agility at sea. Another advantage is that when faring backwards by using the reversing bucket, steering is not inverted, as opposed to propeller-powered ships.

=== Axial flow ===

An axial-flow waterjet&#x27;s pressure is increased by diffusing the flow as it passes through the impeller blades and stator vanes. The pump nozzle then converts this pressure energy into velocity, thus producing thrust.

Axial-flow waterjets produce high volumes at lower velocity, making them well suited to larger low to medium speed craft, the exception being personal water craft, where the high water volumes create tremendous thrust and acceleration as well as high top speeds. But these craft also have high power-to-weight ratios compared to most marine craft. Axial-flow waterjets are by far the most common type of pump.

=== Mixed flow ===

Mixed-flow waterjet designs incorporate aspects of both axial flow and centrifugal flow pumps. Pressure is developed by both diffusion and radial outflow. Mixed flow designs produce lower volumes of water at high velocity making them suited for small to moderate craft sizes and higher speeds. Common uses include high speed pleasure craft and waterjets for shallow water river racing (see River Marathon).

=== Centrifugal flow ===

Centrifugal-flow waterjet designs make use of radial flow to create water pressure.

Examples of centrifugal designs are the Schottel Pump-Jet and outboard sterndrives.

== Advantages ==

Pump jets have some advantages over bare propellers for certain applications, usually related to requirements for high-speed or shallow-draft operations. These include:

* Higher speed before the onset of cavitation, because of the raised internal dynamic pressure
* High power density (with respect to volume) of both the propulsor and the prime mover (because a smaller, higher-speed unit can be used)
* Protection of the rotating element, making operation safer around swimmers and aquatic life
* Improved shallow-water operations, because only the inlet needs to be submerged
* Increased maneuverability, by adding a steerable nozzle to create vectored thrust
* Noise reduction, resulting in a low sonar signature; this particular system has little in common with other pump-jet propulsors and is also known as &quot;shrouded propeller configuration&quot;; applications:
** Warships designed for low observability, for example the Swedish .
** Submarines, for example the Royal Navy and , the US Navy and , the French Navy and &quot;Barracuda&quot; class, and the Russian Navy .
** Modern torpedoes, such as the Spearfish, the Mk 48 and Mk 50 weapons.

== History ==

The water jet principle in shipping industry can be traced back to 1661 when Toogood and Hayes produced a description of a ship having a central water channel in which either a plunger or centrifugal pump was installed to provide the motive power.

On December 3, 1787, inventor James Rumsey demonstrated a water-jet propelled boat using a steam-powered pump to drive a stream of water from the stern. This occurred on the Potomac River at Shepherdstown, Virginia (now West Virginia) before a crowd of witnesses including General Horatio Gates. The 50-foot long boat traveled about one-half mile upriver before returning to the dock. The boat was reported to reach a speed of four mph moving upstream.

On December 21, 1833, Irish engineer John Howard Kyan received a UK patent for propelling ships by a jet of water ejected from the stern.

In April 1932, Italian engineer Secondo Campini demonstrated a pump-jet propelled boat in Venice, Italy. The boat achieved a top speed of , a speed comparable to a boat with a conventional engine of similar output. The Italian Navy, who had funded the development of the boat, placed no orders but did veto the sale of the design outside of Italy. The first modern jetboat was developed by New Zealand engineer Sir William Hamilton in the mid 1950s.

== Uses ==

Pump-jets were once limited to high-speed pleasure craft (such as jet skis and jetboats) and other small vessels, but since 2000 the desire for high-speed vessels has increased and thus the pump-jet is gaining popularity on larger craft, military vessels and ferries. On these larger craft, they can be powered by diesel engines or gas turbines. Speeds of up to can be achieved with this configuration, even with a displacement hull.

Pump-jet powered ships are very maneuverable. Examples of ships using pumpjets are the s, the s, s, the Stena high-speed sea service ferries, the Royal Navy &quot;Swiftsure&quot;, &quot;Trafalgar&quot; and &quot;Astute&quot;-class submarines, as well as the United States &quot;Seawolf&quot; and &quot;Virginia&quot;-classes, and the Russian &quot;Borei&quot;-class submarines. They are also used by the United States littoral combat ships.

<doc id="670512" wikidata="Q2581779" url="?curid=670512" title="Kaumualiʻi">
<text>Kaumualiʻi (c. 1778–May 26, 1824) was the last independent aliʻi nui (supreme ruler of the island) of Kauaʻi and Niʻihau before becoming a vassal of Kamehameha I within the unified Kingdom of Hawaiʻi in 1810. He was the 23rd high chief of Kauaʻi and reigned from 1794 to 1810.

Although he was sometimes known as George Kaumualiʻi, he should not be confused with his son, who is more commonly known by that name.

In Hanamāʻulu, the King Kaumuali&#x27;i Elementary School is named after Kauai&#x27;s last reigning chief.

== Family ==
Kaumualiʻi was the only son of the ruling High Chiefess Kamakahelei, aliʻi nui of Kauaʻi and Niʻihau, and her husband, Aliʻi Kāʻeokūlani (c. 1754–1794), regent of Maui and Molokaʻi. Kāʻeokūlani was the younger son of Kekaulike, the 23rd Aliʻi Aimoku and Moʻi of Maui. He became the co-king and effective ruler of Kauaʻi by his marriage.

When Kamakahelei died in 1794, she passed their titles and positions to the 16-year-old Kaumualiʻi, who reigned under the regency of Chief Inamoʻo until he came of age. His first wife and consort was his half-sister Kawalu of Oʻahu. His second wife was his half-sister Kaʻapuwai Kapuaʻamohu of Kōloa; his third and final wife was the queen regent Kaʻahumanu (1768–1832), Kamehameha&#x27;s widow.

== Unification ==

Kauaʻi and Niʻihau had eluded Kamehameha&#x27;s control since he first tried to add them to his kingdom in 1796, a year after Kaumualiʻi became king. At that time, the governor of the Island of Hawai&#x27;i led a rebellion against Kamehameha, forcing him to return home. Kamehameha tried again in 1803, but disease ravaged his armies, and he called a retreat to heal his men and work on his strategy. Over the next years, Kamehameha amassed the largest armada Hawaiʻi had ever seen: foreign-built schooners and massive war canoes armed with cannons to carry his vast army. Kaumualiʻi decided to negotiate a peaceful resolution rather than resort to bloodshed. The move was supported by Kamehameha as well as the people of Kauaʻi and the foreign sandalwood merchants on the island, whose trade was hurt by the constant feuding. In 1810, Kaumualiʻi met face to face with Kamehameha in Honolulu and negotiated a peaceful surrender, acknowledging Kamehameha as supreme ruler, Kauaʻi as a tributary domain under Kingdom of Hawaiʻi and was able to remain in power to govern the island. He agreed that Kamehameha&#x27;s heir would rule Kauaʻi after his own death.

In 1815, a ship from the Russian-American Company, the &quot;Bering&quot;, was wrecked on Kaua&#x27;i. RAC Governor Alexander Andreyevich Baranov dispatched another ship, the &quot;Isabella&quot;, to retrieve the cargo from the &quot;Bering&quot;. In 1816, Kaumualiʻi signed an agreement to let Georg Anton Schäffer and his Russian crew build the forts Alexander and Barclay-de-Tolly. The Hawaiian fort, Paʻulaʻula o Hipo, was renamed Fort Elizabeth in later decades and attributed to the Russians. Construction began in 1817 but, by fall of that year, the Russians were expelled.

In 1817, Kaumuali&#x27;i married Kekaihaʻakūlou, who became known as Deborah Kapule.

Kamehameha I died in 1819, and the Hawaiians grew fearful that Kaumualiʻi would sever Kauaʻi&#x27;s relationship with the united Hawaiʻi. Kamehameha&#x27;s widow, Kaʻahumanu, was the effective political force in the kingdom. On September 16, 1821, the new young King Kamehameha II arrived and invited Kaumualiʻi aboard his ship. That night, they sailed to Honolulu, where Kaumualiʻi was effectively under house arrest. To make the domination clear, Kaʻahumanu forced him to marry her to ensure the island chain&#x27;s stable union. They remained officially married until his death on May 26, 1824, but had no children. By his wishes, his body was taken to Maui, and buried next to Queen Keōpūolani at the tomb of Halekamani in Lahaina. Their remains were transferred to a tomb on the island of Mokuʻula sometime in 1837 and to the cemetery of Waiola Church in 1884.

Kaumualiʻi was popular among both his people and foreigners who visited and worked on his islands. Captain George Vancouver, who gave the young king a flock of sheep as a gift in 1792, was thanked with a lavish banquet and described his host glowingly. Kaumualiʻi was described as handsome, likeable, and courteous, as well as a capable leader. Upon his death, the people of Kauaʻi sincerely mourned him.

After Kaumualiʻi&#x27;s death in 1824, his son by sacred wife Kawalu, daughter of Kamakahelei and ali&#x27;i Kiha of Ni&#x27;ihau, George &quot;Prince&quot; Kaumualiʻi Humehume (1797–1826), also known as George Tamoree, attempted to reestablish the independence of Kauaʻi but was also eventually captured and taken to Honolulu, where he died of influenza. He had three offspring, a son who died young, a daughter born in 1821 who was given away to another chiefess on Kaua&#x27;i, and Harriet Kawahinekipi Kaumualiʻi. Humehume&#x27;s half-brother Kealiʻiahonui was also forced to marry Kaʻahumanu. Kaʻahumanu later abandoned Kealiʻiahonui and embraced Christianity. Kealiʻiahonui later married Princess Kekauōnohi, the governess of Maui and Kauaʻi and a widow of Kamehameha II.

King Kaumualiʻi&#x27;s granddaughter Kapiʻolani of Hilo (eldest daughter of Kaumualiʻi&#x27;s daughter Kekaulike Kinoiki) married King Kalākaua. In 1874, the Hawaiian legislature elected the couple king and queen of the Hawaiian Islands as King Kalākaua and Queen Kapiʻolani. Kapi&#x27;olani&#x27;s youngest sister, Princess Victoria Kuhio Kinoike Kekaulike of Hilo, was later appointed governor of Kauaʻi, princess and royal highness. Princess Victoria&#x27;s other sister, Princess Virginia Kapoʻoloku Poʻomaikelani, succeeded her sister as governor of Kauaʻi and was made Guardian of the Royal Tombs.

Hawaii Route 50 on Kauaʻi is named &quot;Kaumualiʻi Highway&quot; in the honor of Kaua&#x27;i&#x27;s last high chief.

<doc id="670514" wikidata="Q1616185" url="?curid=670514" title="Tom and Huck">
<text>Tom and Huck is a 1995 American adventure comedy-drama film based on Mark Twain&#x27;s 1876 novel &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot;, and starring Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Brad Renfro, Mike McShane, Eric Schweig, and Amy Wright. The film was directed by Peter Hewitt and produced/co-written by Stephen Sommers (who also worked on Disney&#x27;s adaptation of Twain&#x27;s 1884 novel, 1993&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Huck Finn&quot;). The film was released in North America on December 22, 1995.

In the film, mischievous young Tom Sawyer witnesses a murder by a vicious half-Native American criminal known as &quot;Injun Joe&quot;. Tom befriends Huck Finn, a boy with no future and no family, and is forced to choose between honoring a friendship or honoring an oath, when the town drunk is accused of the murder.

==Plot==
One dark stormy night, Native American crook Injun Joe goes to meet Dr. Jonas Robinson for some shady business. Meanwhile, a boy named Tom Sawyer runs away from home with his friends to become steamboat men. This ultimately fails as their raft collides on a rock in the Mississippi River, throwing Tom into the water. His friends find him washed up on the shore, and Tom finds it was Huckleberry &quot;Huck&quot; Finn who carried him to safety. Tom later meets Huck discovering an unusual way to remove warts - by taking a dead cat to the graveyard at night. There, they witness Joe and Muff Potter, the town drunk, digging up the grave of Vic &quot;One-Eyed&quot; Murrell for Robinson. A treasure map is discovered and Robinson assaults Muff and Injun Joe in an attempt to take it for himself. He manages to knock out Muff, but Joe fights back by fatally stabbing Doc with Muff&#x27;s knife.

The next morning, Muff is charged for the murder. Tom and Huck had signed an oath saying that if either of them came forward about it, they would drop dead and rot. The boys embark on a search for the treasure map Injun Joe has, so they can declare Muff innocent while preserving their oath. Eventually, however, Joe finds the lost treasure and asks his partner to hide it in a cave before burning the map. With the only evidence to prove Muff&#x27;s innocence destroyed, Tom and Huck&#x27;s friendship starts to decline, and Huck eventually leaves Hannibal. Joe then discovers that Tom was a witness to the crime. He finds Tom and threatens he will kill him if he ever tells anyone about the murder.

At Muff’s trial, Tom decides that his friendship with Muff is more important than his oath with Huck and exposes the truth. Joe unsuccessfully attempts to kill Tom before leaving Hannibal. The townspeople declare Tom as a hero for his bravery and plans to throw a festival to commemorate the occasion. Knowing that Joe wants him dead, Tom decides not to attend. Huck later sneaks into Tom&#x27;s bedroom one night, criticizing Tom for breaking their oath before leaving town again.

The next day during the festival, a group of children, including Tom and his love interest Becky Thatcher, enter the caves, where Tom and Becky become lost. Meanwhile, the judge is alerted by the sheriff that Joe ended up killing his partner. Huck, who secretly attends the festival, overhears all this and goes after Tom. Tom and Becky eventually stumble upon Injun Joe in McDougal&#x27;s Cave. He traps them, but Tom and Becky manage to escape. Tom and Becky later discover the spot where Joe hid his treasure. Tom then finds an opening in the cave and asks Becky to get her father.

Joe ultimately finds Tom and attempts to kill him before Huck suddenly shows up. After a brief struggle, Joe easily overpowers Huck. Just as Joe is about to land a finishing blow, Tom quietly empties the contents from the treasure chest and threatens Joe by throwing the treasure chest over a chasm. Joe then tries to get the chest from Tom, only to fall into the chasm to his death. The boys reconcile as they claim Joe&#x27;s treasure and are declared heroes by the people. Tom is praised on the front page of the newspaper, and Widow Douglas adopts Huck.

<text>This is a list of named geological features on [[Dione (moon)|Dione]], a moon of Saturn. Dionean geological features are named after people and places in Roman mythology.

==Catenae==
Catenae are crater chains. They are named after rivers in Roman mythology.

==Chasmata==
Dionean chasms or canyons are called chasmata . They are named after important locations in Roman mythology and history.

==Dorsa==
Dionean ridges are called dorsa. They are named after Roman hills.

==Fossae==

Dionean fossae (long narrow depressions) are named after cities, streets and rivers in Roman mythology.

<text>Lionel Murray, Baron Murray of Epping Forest, (2 August 1922 – 20 May 2004) was a British Labour Party politician and trade union leader. He served as the General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress from 1973 to 1984.

==Early life==
Murray was born in Hadley, Shropshire, the son of a young unmarried woman, Lorna Hodskinson, and was brought up by a local nurse, Mary Jane Chilton. He attended Wellington Grammar School, read English at Queen Mary College, London, and then joined the British Army.

===Army===
In the Second World War Murray was commissioned in the King&#x27;s Shropshire Light Infantry in April 1943 and took part in the Normandy landings on D-Day. Six days later, Murray was badly wounded and in October 1944 was invalided out of the army with the rank of lieutenant.

===Demobilisation===
Murray worked at an engineering works in Wolverhampton as storekeeper, before leaving to sell &quot;The Daily Worker&quot; on street corners and joining the Communist Party. Whilst selling &quot;The Daily Worker&quot;, he encountered his former headmaster, who informed him he was wasting his time. Determined to improve himself, shortly afterwards Murray gained a place at New College, Oxford, where he graduated with a First in PPE after two years&#x27; study under tutors including the future MP Dick Crossman and Sir John Hicks.

==Career==
Murray started as a manager for a Liverpool catering firm. He was a Trades Union Congress (TUC) employee from 1947, when he joined as an assistant in the economics department. Seven years later he was promoted to head of the department. He was elected assistant general-secretary in 1969.

In 1970 he was invited to deliver the Marlow (Scotland) Lecture to the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland. He chose the subject &quot;Trade Unions and the State – 1964 to 1970 in Retrospect&quot;.

He became General Secretary of the TUC in 1973, leading it during the Winter of Discontent and the confrontations with Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government.

==Personal life==
Murray married Heather Woolf, a nurse, in 1945. The couple had two daughters and two sons, the younger of whom, David, pursued a successful career in the Royal Air Force. They lived in Loughton, Essex.

Murray served as a TUC officer until his retirement in 1984, three years early. Upon his retirement in early May 1984, he made the following statement – &quot;There are places to go, books to read, flowers to smell and trees to look at. I would like to walk through Epping Forest&quot;.

He was active in Loughton Methodist Church. Murray died in hospital in 2004 from septicaemia and pneumonia.

==Honours==
Murray was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1966 New Year Honours.

Sworn of the Privy Council in 1976, he was created a life peer as Baron Murray of Epping Forest, of Telford in the County of Shropshire, on 14 February 1985. The Murray Hall in Loughton was named after him, and a blue plaque to him was unveiled on the family house, 29 The Crescent, in January 2019.

<doc id="670527" wikidata="Q1062445" url="?curid=670527" title="Local government in Fiji">
<text>Fiji is divided administratively into four divisions, which are further subdivided into fourteen provinces. Each province has a provincial council.

== Administrative divisions ==

Fiji is divided administratively into four divisions, which are further subdivided into fourteen provinces; the self-governing island of Rotuma and its nearby islets lie outside any of the four divisions. Each division is headed by a &quot;Commissioner,&quot; appointed by the Fijian government.

The divisions are basically agglomerations of provinces and have few administrative functions of their own, but serve to foster cooperation among the member provinces for providing services.

=== Provinces ===

== Provincial council ==
Each province has a &quot;provincial council&quot; which may make bylaws and impose rates (local taxes), subject to the approval of the iTaukei Affairs Board a government department. The board must also approve the appointment of the &quot;Roko Tui&quot;, or executive head of the provincial council, who is usually a high chief, although in recent years, commoners have sometimes been chosen.

The provinces used to have direct input into national affairs through the Great Council of Chiefs and the Senate. The Great Council of Chiefs was a traditional body which advised the government on indigenous affairs and also functioned as an electoral college to elect the President and Vice-President; 42 of the 55 members of the Great Council were chosen by the provincial councils, three from each province. In addition, 14 of the 32 members of the Senate, the upper house of the Fijian Parliament, were chosen by the provincial councils (one Senator each) and confirmed by the Great Council of Chiefs. The Military-backed interim government that seized power in a military coup on 5 December 2006 formally abolished the Great Council of Chiefs in 2012, and the 2013 Constitution promulgated by the regime similarly abolished the Senate. This effectively ended provincial input into national government affairs.

== Island of Rotuma ==
The island of Rotuma, north of the main archipelago, is a self-governing dependency according to the Rotuma Act promulgated in 1927. The Fiji government includes it in the Eastern Division for statistical purposes (such as the census), but it has its own council, which is empowered to legislate on most local matters. Like a province, Rotuma used to choose (through its council) 3 members of the Great Council of Chiefs and 1 Senator.

== Provincial administration ==
Below the provincial level, districts and villages, based on extended family networks, have their own chiefs and councils. Indigenous Fijian administration is based on the &quot;koro,&quot; or village, headed by a &quot;Turaga ni Koro&quot; elected or appointed by the villagers. Several koros combine to form a &quot;Tikina,&quot; two or more of which comprise a province. In addition, municipal governments have been established for the cities of Suva and Lautoka, and for ten towns. Each has a city or town council elected for a three-year term, presided over by a Mayor chosen by the councillors from among their own members. On 15 February 2006, the government announced legislation to change the local government term of office from three years to four.

Provincial administration, and its subdivisions, cater for ethnic Fijians, town and city councils cater for urban residents of all races. Local authorities have also been established for rural areas, with advisory powers, and these provide a voice to people of all races outside the provincial structure. The Ministry of Regional Development ensures that Fiji&#x27;s rural areas are provided with the access to opportunities and basic amenities that are enjoyed by the urban areas. This is done through its district administrations which are involved in community capacity building, coordinating the development projects like upgrading of rural roads, upgrading of cane access roads, development of roads for access to cash crops and other capital programs in their respective districts. They also attend to some statutory functions such as registration of births, deaths and marriages, liquor licences and acting as Third Class Magistrates.

== Districts ==
Fiji is divided into 17 districts, each with a district officer and five sub-districts with assistant district officers. The districts generally centre on towns and cities, but some follow provincial or tikina boundaries. The districts are: Ra, Tavua, Ba, Nadi, Nadarivatu, Keiyasi, Nausori, Navua, Vunidawa, Suva, Korovou, Macuata, Savusavu, Bua, Taveuni, Seaqaqa, Saqani, Tukavesi, Kadavu, Rotuma, Lomaiviti, Lautoka.

<doc id="670531" wikidata="Q1187620" url="?curid=670531" title="Perfect graph">
<text>In graph theory, a perfect graph is a graph in which the chromatic number equals the size of the maximum clique, both in the graph itself and in every induced subgraph. In all graphs, the chromatic number is greater than or equal to the size of the maximum clique, but they can be far apart. A graph is perfect when these numbers are equal, and remain equal after the deletion of arbitrary subsets of vertices.

The perfect graphs include many important families of graphs and serve to unify results relating colorings and cliques in those families. For instance, in all perfect graphs, the graph coloring problem, maximum clique problem, and maximum independent set problem can all be solved in polynomial time, despite their greater complexity for non-perfect graphs. In addition, several important minimax theorems in combinatorics, including Dilworth&#x27;s theorem and Mirsky&#x27;s theorem on partially ordered sets, Kőnig&#x27;s theorem on matchings, and the Erdős–Szekeres theorem on monotonic sequences, can be expressed in terms of the perfection of certain associated graphs.

The perfect graph theorem states that the complement graph of a perfect graph is also perfect. The strong perfect graph theorem characterizes the perfect graphs in terms of certain forbidden induced subgraphs, leading to a polynomial time algorithm for testing whether a graph is perfect.

==Definitions and characterizations==

A clique in an undirected graph is a subset of its vertices that are all adjacent to each other, such as the subsets of vertices connected by heavy edges in the illustration. The clique number is the number of vertices in the largest clique: two in the illustrated seven-vertex cycle, and three in the other graph shown. A graph coloring assigns a color to each vertex so that each two adjacent vertices have different colors, also shown in the illustration. The chromatic number of a graph is the minimum number of colors in any coloring. The colorings shown are optimal, so the chromatic number is three for the 7-cycle and four for the other graph shown. The vertices of any clique must have different colors, so the chromatic number is always greater than or equal to the clique number. For some graphs, they are equal; for others, such as the ones shown, they are unequal. The perfect graphs are defined as the graphs for which these two numbers are equal, not just in the graph itself, but in every induced subgraph obtained by deleting some of its vertices.
The perfect graph theorem asserts that the complement graph of a perfect graph is itself perfect. The complement graph has an edge between two vertices if and only if the given graph does not. A clique, in the complement graph, corresponds to an independent set in the given. A coloring of the complement graph corresponds to a clique cover, a partition of the vertices of the given graph into cliques. The fact that the complement of a perfect graph formula_1 is also perfect implies that, in formula_1 itself, the independence number (the size of its maximum independent set), equals its clique cover number (the fewest number of cliques needed in a clique cover). More strongly, the same thing is true in every induced subgraph of the complement graph. This provides an alternative and equivalent definition of the perfect graphs: they are the graphs for which, in each induced subgraph, the independence number equals the clique cover number.

The strong perfect graph theorem gives a different way of defining perfect graphs, by their structure instead of by their properties.
It is based on the existence of cycle graphs and their complements within a given graph. A cycle of odd length, greater than three, is not perfect: its clique number is two, but its chromatic number is three. By the perfect graph theorem, the complement of an odd cycle of length greater than three is also not perfect. The complement of a length-5 cycle is another length-5 cycle, but for larger odd lengths the complement is not a cycle; it is called an &quot;anticycle&quot;. The strong perfect graph theorem asserts that these are the only forbidden induced subgraphs for the perfect graphs: a graph is perfect if and only if its induced subgraphs include neither an odd cycle nor an odd anticycle of five or more vertices. In this context, induced cycles that are not triangles are called &quot;holes&quot;, and their complements are called &quot;antiholes&quot;, so the strong perfect graph theorem can be stated more succinctly: a graph is perfect if and only if it has neither an odd hole nor an odd antihole.

These results can be combined in another characterization of perfect graphs: they are the graphs for which the product of the clique number and independence number is greater than or equal to the number of vertices, and for which the same is true for all induced subgraphs. Because the statement of this characterization remains invariant under complementation of graphs, it implies the perfect graph theorem. One direction of this characterization follows easily from the original definition of perfect: the number of vertices in any graph equals the sum of the sizes of the color classes in an optimal coloring, and is less than or equal to the number of colors multiplied by the independence number. In a perfect graph, the number of colors equals the clique number, and can be replaced by the clique number in this inequality. The other direction can be proved directly, but it also follows from the strong perfect graph theorem: if a graph is not perfect, it contains an odd cycle or its complement, and in these subgraphs the product of the clique number and independence number is one less than the number of vertices.

== History ==
The theory of perfect graphs developed from a 1958 result of Tibor Gallai that in modern language can be interpreted as stating that the complement of a bipartite graph is perfect; this result can also be viewed as a simple equivalent of Kőnig&#x27;s theorem, a much earlier result relating matchings and vertex covers in bipartite graphs. The first formulation of the concept of perfect graphs more generally was in a 1961 paper by Claude Berge, in German, and the first use of the phrase &quot;perfect graph&quot; appears to be in a 1963 paper of Berge. In these works he unified Gallai&#x27;s result with several similar results by defining perfect graphs, and he conjectured both the perfect graph theorem and the strong perfect graph theorem. In formulating these concepts, Berge was motivated by the concept of the Shannon capacity of a graph, by the fact that for (co-)perfect graphs it equals the independence number, and by the search for minimal examples of graphs for which this is not the case. Until the strong perfect graph theorem was proven, the graphs described by it (that is, the graphs with no odd hole and no odd antihole) were called &quot;Berge graphs&quot;.

The perfect graph theorem was proven by László Lovász in 1972, who in the same year proved the stronger inequality between the number of vertices and the product of the clique number and independence number, without benefit of the strong perfect graph theorem. In 1991, Alfred Lehman won the Fulkerson Prize, sponsored jointly by the Mathematical Optimization Society and American Mathematical Society, for his work on generalizations of the theory of perfect graphs to logical matrices. The conjectured strong perfect graph theorem became the focus of research in the theory of perfect graphs for many years, until its proof was announced in 2002 by Maria Chudnovsky, Neil Robertson, Paul Seymour, and Robin Thomas, and published by them in 2006. This work won its authors the 2009 Fulkerson Prize. The perfect graph theorem has a short proof, but the proof of the strong perfect graph theorem is long and technical, based on a deep structural decomposition of Berge graphs. Related decomposition techniques have also borne fruit in the study of other graph classes, and in particular for the claw-free graphs. The symmetric characterization of perfect graphs in terms of the product of clique number and independence number was originally suggested by Hajnal and proven by Lovász.

==Families of graphs==
Many well-studied families of graphs are perfect, and in many cases the fact that these graphs are perfect corresponds to a minimax theorem for some kinds of combinatorial structure defined by these graphs. Examples of this phenomenon include the perfection of bipartite graphs and their line graphs, associated with Kőnig&#x27;s theorem relating maximum matchings and vertex covers in bipartite graphs, and the perfection of comparability graphs, associated with Dilworth&#x27;s theorem and Mirsky&#x27;s theorem on chains and antichains in partially ordered sets. Other important classes of graphs, defined by having a structure related to the holes and antiholes of the strong perfect graph theorem, include the chordal graphs, Meyniel graphs, and their subclasses.

===Bipartite graphs and line graphs===

In bipartite graphs (with at least one edge) the chromatic number and clique number both equal two. Their induced subgraphs remain bipartite, so bipartite graphs are perfect. Other important families of graphs are bipartite, and therefore also perfect, including for instance the trees and median graphs. By the perfect graph theorem, maximum independent sets in bipartite graphs have the same size as their minimum clique covers. The maximum independent set is complementary to a minimum vertex cover, a set of vertices that touches all edges. A minimum clique cover consists of a maximum matching (as many disjoint edges as possible) together with one-vertex cliques for all remaining vertices, and its size is the number of vertices minus the number of matching edges. Therefore, this equality can be expressed equivalently as an equality between the size of the maximum matching and the minimum vertex cover in bipartite graphs, the usual formulation of Kőnig&#x27;s theorem.

A matching, in any graph formula_1, is the same thing as an independent set in the line graph formula_4, a graph that has a vertex for each edge in formula_1 and an edge between two vertices in formula_4 for each pair of edges in formula_1 that share an endpoint. Line graphs have two kinds of cliques: sets of edges in formula_1 with a common endpoint, and triangles in formula_1. In bipartite graphs, there are no triangles, so a clique cover in formula_4 corresponds to a vertex cover in formula_1. Therefore, in line graphs of bipartite graphs, the independence number and clique cover number are equal. Induced subgraphs of line graphs of bipartite graphs are line graphs of subgraphs, so the line graphs of bipartite graphs are perfect. Examples include the rook&#x27;s graphs, the line graphs of complete bipartite graphs. Every line graph of a bipartite graph is an induced subgraph of a rook&#x27;s graph.

Because line graphs of bipartite graphs are perfect, their clique number equals their chromatic number. The clique number of the line graph of a bipartite graph is the maximum degree of any vertex of the underlying bipartite graph. The chromatic number of the line graph of a bipartite graph is the chromatic index of the underlying bipartite graph, the minimum number of colors needed to color the edges so that touching edges have different colors. Each color class forms a matching, and the chromatic index is the minimum number of matchings needed to cover all edges. The equality of maximum degree and chromatic index, in bipartite graphs, is another theorem of Dénes Kőnig. In arbitrary simple graphs, they can differ by one; this is Vizing&#x27;s theorem.
The underlying graph formula_1 of a perfect line graph formula_4 is a line perfect graph. These are the graphs whose biconnected components are bipartite graphs, the complete graph formula_14, and triangular books, sets of triangles sharing an edge. These components are perfect, and their combination preserves perfection, so every line perfect graph is perfect.

The bipartite graphs, their complements, and the line graphs of bipartite graphs and their complements form four basic classes of perfect graphs that play a key role in the proof of the strong perfect graph theorem. According to the structural decomposition of perfect graphs used as part of this proof, every perfect graph that is not already in one of these four classes can be decomposed by partitioning its vertices into subsets, in one of four ways, called a 2-join, the complement of a 2-join, a homogeneous pair, or a skew partition.

===Comparability graphs===

A partially ordered set is defined by its set of elements, and a comparison relation formula_15 that is reflexive (for all elements formula_16, formula_17), antisymmetric (if formula_18 and formula_19, then formula_20, and transitive (if formula_18 and formula_22, then formula_23). Elements formula_16 and formula_25 are &quot;comparable&quot; if formula_18 or formula_19, and &quot;incomparable&quot; otherwise. For instance, set inclusion (formula_28) partially orders any family of sets. The comparability graph of a partially ordered set has the set elements as its vertices, with an edge connecting any two comparable elements. Its complement is called an &quot;incomparability graph&quot;. Different partial orders may have the same comparability graph; for instance, reversing all comparisons changes the order but not the graph.

Finite comparability graphs (and their complementary incomparability graphs) are always perfect. A clique, in a comparability graph, comes from a subset of elements that are all pairwise comparable; such a subset is called a chain, and it is linearly ordered by the given partial order. An independent set comes from a subset of elements no two of which are comparable; such a subset is called an antichain. For instance, in the illustrated partial order and comparability graph, formula_29 is a chain in the order and a clique in the graph, while formula_30 is an antichain in the order and an independent set in the graph. Thus, a coloring of a comparability graph is a partition of its elements into antichains, and a clique cover is a partition of its elements into chains. Dilworth&#x27;s theorem, in the theory of partial orders, states that for every finite partial order, the size of the largest antichain equals the minimum number of chains into which the elements can be partitioned. In the language of graphs, this can be stated as: every finite comparability graph is perfect. Similarly, Mirsky&#x27;s theorem states that for every finite partial order, the size of the largest chain equals the minimum number of antichains into which the elements can be partitioned, or that every finite incomparability graph is perfect. These two theorems are equivalent via the perfect graph theorem, but Mirsky&#x27;s theorem is easier to prove directly than Dilworth&#x27;s theorem: if each element is labeled by the size of the largest chain in which it is maximal, then the subsets with equal labels form a partition into antichains, with the number of antichains equal to the size of the largest chain overall. Every bipartite graph is a comparability graph. Thus, Kőnig&#x27;s theorem can be seen as a special case of Dilworth&#x27;s theorem, connected through the theory of perfect graphs.
A permutation graph is defined from a permutation on a totally ordered sequence of elements (conventionally, the integers from formula_31 to formula_32), which form the vertices of the graph. The edges of a permutation graph connect pairs of elements whose ordering is reversed by the given permutation. These are naturally incomparability graphs, for a partial order in which formula_18 whenever formula_16 occurs before formula_25 in both the given sequence and its permutation. The complement of a permutation graph is another permutation graph, for the reverse of the given permutation. Therefore, as well as being incomparability graphs, permutation graphs are comparability graphs. In fact, the permutation graphs are exactly the graphs that are both comparability and incomparability graphs. A clique, in a permutation graph, is a subsequence of elements that appear in increasing order in the given permutation, and an independent set is a subsequence of elements that appear in decreasing order. In any perfect graph, the product of the clique number and independence number are at least the number of vertices; the special case of this inequality for permutation graphs is the Erdős–Szekeres theorem.
The interval graphs are the incomparability graphs of interval orders, orderings defined by sets of intervals on the real line with formula_18 whenever interval formula_16 is completely to the left of interval formula_25. In the corresponding interval graph, there is an edge from formula_16 to formula_25 whenever the two intervals have a point in common. Coloring these graphs can be used to model problems of assigning resources to tasks (such as classrooms to classes) with intervals describing the scheduled time of each task. Both interval graphs and permutation graphs are generalized by the trapezoid graphs. Systems of intervals in which no two are nested produce a more restricted class of graphs, the indifference graphs, the incomparability graphs of semiorders. These have been used to model human preferences under the assumption that, when items have utilities that are very close to each other, they will be incomparable. Intervals where every pair is nested or disjoint produce trivially perfect graphs, the comparability graphs of ordered trees. In them, the independence number equals the number of maximal cliques.

===Split graphs and random perfect graphs===

A split graph is a graph that can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set. It can be colored by assigning a separate color to each vertex of a maximal clique, and then coloring each remaining vertex the same as a non-adjacent clique vertex. Therefore, these graphs have equal clique numbers and chromatic numbers, and are perfect. A broader class of graphs, the &quot;unipolar graphs&quot; can be partitioned into a clique and a cluster graph, a disjoint union of cliques. These include also the bipartite graphs, for which the cluster graph is just a single clique. The unipolar graphs and their complements together form the class of &quot;generalized split graphs&quot;. Almost all perfect graphs are generalized split graphs, in the sense that the fraction of perfect formula_32-vertex graphs that are generalized split graphs goes to one in the limit as formula_32 grows arbitrarily large.

Other limiting properties of almost all perfect graphs can be determined by studying the generalized split graphs. In this way, it has been shown that almost all perfect graphs contain a Hamiltonian cycle. If formula_43 is an arbitrary graph, the limiting probability that formula_43 occurs as an induced subgraph of a large random perfect graph is 0, 1/2, or 1, respectively as formula_43 is not a generalized split graph, is unipolar or co-unipolar but not both, or is both unipolar and co-unipolar.

===Incremental constructions===
Several families of perfect graphs can be characterized by an incremental construction in which the graphs in the family are built up by adding one vertex at a time, according to certain rules, which guarantee that after each vertex is added the graph remains perfect.
* The chordal graphs are the graphs formed by a construction of this type in which, at the time a vertex is added, its neighbors form a clique. Chordal graphs may also be characterized as the graphs that have no holes (even or odd). They include as special cases the forests, the interval graphs, and the maximal outerplanar graphs. The split graphs are exactly the graphs that are chordal and have a chordal complement. The -trees, central to the definition of treewidth, are chordal graphs formed by starting with a -vertex clique and repeatedly adding a vertex so that it and its neighbors form a clique of the same size.

* The distance-hereditary graphs are formed, starting from a single-vertex graph, by repeatedly adding degree-one vertices (&quot;pendant vertices&quot;) or copies of existing vertices (with the same neighbors). Each vertex and its copy may be adjacent (&quot;true twins&quot;) or non-adjacent (&quot;false twins&quot;). In every connected induced subgraph of these graphs, the distances between vertices are the same as in the whole graph. If only the twin operations are used, the result is a cograph. The cographs are the comparability graphs of series-parallel partial orders and can also be formed by a different construction process combining complementation and the disjoint union of graphs.
* The graphs that are both chordal and distance-hereditary are called Ptolemaic graphs, because their distances obey Ptolemy&#x27;s inequality. They have a restricted form of the distance-hereditary construction sequence, in which a false twin can only be added when its neighbors would form a clique. They include as special cases the windmill graphs consisting of cliques joined at a single vertex, and the block graphs in which each biconnected component is a clique.
* The threshold graphs are formed from an empty graph by repeatedly adding either an isolated vertex (connected to nothing else) or a universal vertex (connected to all other vertices). They are special cases of the split graphs and the trivially perfect graphs. They are exactly the graphs that are both trivially perfect and the complement of a trivially perfect graph; they are also exactly the graphs that are both cographs and split graphs.

If the vertices of a chordal graph are colored in the order of an incremental construction sequence using a greedy coloring algorithm, the result will be an optimal coloring. The reverse of the vertex ordering used in this construction is called an &quot;elimination order&quot;. Similarly, if the vertices of a distance-hereditary graph are colored in the order of an incremental construction sequence, the resulting coloring will be optimal. If the vertices of a comparability graph are colored in the order of a linear extension of its underlying partial order, the resulting coloring will be optimal. This property is generalized in the family of perfectly orderable graphs, the graphs for which there exists an ordering that, when restricted to any induced subgraph, causes greedy coloring to be optimal. The cographs are exactly the graphs for which all vertex orderings have this property. Another subclass of perfectly orderable graphs are the complements of tolerance graphs, a generalization of interval graphs.

===Strong perfection===
The strongly perfect graphs are graphs in which, in every induced subgraph, there exists an independent set that intersects all maximal cliques. In the Meyniel graphs or &quot;very strongly perfect graphs&quot;, every vertex belongs to such an independent set. The Meyniel graphs can also be characterized as the graphs in which every odd cycle of length five or more has at least two chords.
A parity graph is defined by the property that between every two vertices, all induced paths have equal parity: either they are all even in length, or they are all odd in length. These include the distance-hereditary graphs, in which all induced paths between two vertices have the same length, and bipartite graphs, for which all paths (not just induced paths) between any two vertices have equal parity. Parity graphs are Meyniel graphs, and therefore perfect: if a long odd cycle had only one chord, the two parts of the cycle between the endpoints of the chord would be induced paths of different parity. The prism over any parity graph (its Cartesian product with a single edge) is another parity graph, and the parity graphs are the only graphs whose prisms are perfect.

==Matrices, polyhedra, and integer programming==
Perfect graphs are closely connected to the theory of linear programming and integer programming. Both linear programs and integer programs are expressed in canonical form as seeking a vector formula_16 that maximizes a linear objective function formula_47, subject to the linear constraints formula_48 and formula_49. Here, formula_50 is given as a matrix, and formula_51 and formula_52 are given as two vectors. Although linear programs and integer programs are specified in this same way, they differ in that, in a linear program, the solution vector formula_16 is allowed to have arbitrary real numbers as its coefficients, whereas in an integer program these unknown coefficients must be integers. This makes a very big difference in the computational complexity of these problems: linear programming can be solved in polynomial time, but integer programming is NP-hard.

When the same given values formula_50, formula_51, and formula_52 are used to define both a linear program and an integer program, they commonly have different optimal solutions. The linear program is called an integral linear program if an optimal solution to the integer program is also optimal for the linear program. (Otherwise, the ratio between the two solution values is called the integrality gap, and is important in analyzing approximation algorithms for the integer program.) Perfect graphs may be used to characterize the (0, 1) matrices formula_50 (that is, matrices where all coefficients are 0 or 1) with the following property: if formula_51 is the all-ones vector, then for all choices of formula_52 the resulting linear program is integral.

As Václav Chvátal proved, every matrix formula_50 with this property is (up to removal of irrelevant &quot;dominated&quot; rows) the maximal clique versus vertex incidence matrix of a perfect graph. This matrix has a column for each vertex of the graph, and a row for each maximal clique, with a coefficient that is one in the columns of vertices that belong to the clique and zero in the remaining columns. The integral linear programs encoded by this matrix seek the maximum-weight independent set of the given graph, with weights given by the vector formula_52.

For a matrix formula_50 defined in this way from a perfect graph, the vectors formula_16 satisfying the system of inequalities formula_48, formula_65 form an integral polytope. It is the convex hull of the indicator vectors of independent sets in the graph, with facets corresponding to the maximal cliques in the graph. The perfect graphs are the only graphs for which the two polytopes defined in this way from independent sets and from maximal cliques coincide.

==Algorithms==
In all perfect graphs, the graph coloring problem, maximum clique problem, and maximum independent set problem can all be solved in polynomial time. The algorithm for the general case involves the Lovász number of these graphs. The Lovász number of any graph can be determined by labeling its vertices by high dimensional unit vectors, so that each two non-adjacent vertices have perpendicular labels, and so that all of the vectors lie in a cone with as small an opening angle as possible. Then, the Lovász number is formula_66, where formula_67 is the half-angle of this cone. Despite this complicated definition, an accurate numerical value of the Lovász number can be computed using semidefinite programming, and for any graph the Lovász number is sandwiched between the chromatic number and clique number. Because these two numbers equal each other in perfect graphs, they also equal the Lovász number. Thus, they can be computed by approximating the Lovász number accurately enough and rounding the result to the nearest integer.

The solution method for semidefinite programs, used by this algorithm, is based on the ellipsoid method for linear programming. It leads to a polynomial time algorithm for computing the chromatic number and clique number in perfect graphs. However, solving these problems using the Lovász number and the ellipsoid method is complicated and has a high polynomial exponent. More efficient combinatorial algorithms are known for many special cases.

This method can also be generalized to find the maximum weight of a clique, in a weighted graph, instead of the clique number. A maximum or maximum weight clique itself, and an optimal coloring of the graph, can also be found by these methods, and a maximum independent set can be found by applying the same approach to the complement of the graph. For instance, a maximum clique can be found by the following algorithm:
*Loop through the vertices of the graph. For each vertex formula_68, perform the following steps:
**Tentatively remove formula_68 from the graph.
**Use semidefinite programming to determine the clique number of the resulting induced subgraph.
**If this clique number is the same as for the whole graph, permanently remove formula_68; otherwise, restore formula_68 to the graph.
*Return the subgraph that remains after all the permanent removals.
The algorithm for finding an optimal coloring is more complicated, and depends on the duality theory of linear programs, using this clique-finding algorithm as a separation oracle.

Beyond solving these problems, another important computational problem concerning perfect graphs is their recognition, the problem of testing whether a given graph is perfect. For many years the complexity of recognizing Berge graphs and perfect graphs were considered separately (as they were not yet known to be equivalent) and both remained open. They were both known to be in co-NP; for Berge graphs, this follows from the definition, while for perfect graphs it follows from the characterization using the product of the clique number and independence number. After the strong perfect graph theorem was proved, Chudnovsky, Cornuéjols, Liu, Seymour, and Vušković discovered a polynomial time algorithm for testing the existence of odd holes or anti-holes. By the strong perfect graph theorem, this can be used to test whether a given graph is perfect, in polynomial time.

==Related concepts==
Generalizing the perfect graphs, a graph class is said to be χ-bounded if the chromatic number of the graphs in the class can be bounded by a function of their clique number. The perfect graphs are exactly the graphs for which this function is the identity, both for the graph itself and for all its induced subgraphs.

The equality of the clique number and chromatic number in perfect graphs has motivated the definition of other graph classes, in which other graph invariants are set equal to each other. For instance, the domination perfect graphs are defined as graphs in which, in every induced subgraph, the smallest dominating set (a set of vertices adjacent to all remaining vertices) equals the size of the smallest independent set that is a dominating set. These include, for instance, the claw-free graphs.

<text>The University of Cape Town (UCT) (, ) is a public research university in Cape Town, South Africa. Established in 1829 as the South African College, it was granted full university status in 1918, making it the oldest university in South Africa and the oldest university in Sub-Saharan Africa in continuous operation.

UCT is organised in 57 departments across six faculties offering bachelor&#x27;s (NQF 7) to doctoral degrees (NQF 10) solely in the English language. Home to 30,000 students, it encompasses six campuses in the Capetonian suburbs of Rondebosch, Hiddingh, Observatory, Mowbray, and the Waterfront. It is the only African member of the Global University Leaders Forum (GULF) within the World Economic Forum, which is made up of 26 of the world&#x27;s top universities. 

Five alumni, staff members, and researchers associated with UCT have won the Nobel Prize. 88 staff members are part of the Academy of Sciences of South Africa.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The University of Cape Town was founded at a meeting in the Groote Kerk in 1829 as the South African College, a high school for young men. The college had a small tertiary-education facility, introduced in 1874 that grew substantially after 1880, when the discovery of gold and diamonds in the north – and the resulting demand for skills in mining – gave it the financial boost it needed to grow. The college developed into a fully fledged university during the period 1880 to 1900, thanks to increased funding from private sources and the government.

During these years, the college built its first dedicated science laboratories, and started the departments of mineralogy and geology to meet the need for skilled personnel in the country&#x27;s emerging diamond and gold-mining industries. The UCT crest was designed in 1859 by Charles Davidson Bell, Surveyor-General of the Cape Colony at the time. Bell was an accomplished artist who also designed medals and the triangular Cape stamp. Another key development during this period was the admission of women. In 1886 the professor of chemistry, Paul Daniel Hahn, convinced the council to admit four women into his chemistry class on a trial basis. Owing to the exceptional standard of work by the women students, the college decided to admit women students permanently in honour of Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee in 1887.

The years 1902 to 1918 saw the establishment of the Medical School, the introduction of engineering courses and a Department of Education. UCT was formally established as a university in 1918, on the basis of the Alfred Beit bequest and additional substantial gifts from mining magnates Julius Wernher and Otto Beit. The new university also attracted substantial support from well-wishers in the Cape Town area and, for the first time, a significant state grant.

In 1928, the university was able to move the bulk of its facilities to Groote Schuur on the slopes of Devil&#x27;s Peak, on land bequeathed to the nation by Cecil John Rhodes as the site for a national university. UCT celebrated its centenary the following year.

=== Apartheid era ===

Apart from establishing itself as a leading research and teaching university in the decades that followed, UCT earned itself the nickname &quot;Moscow on the Hill&quot; during the period 1960 to 1990 for its sustained opposition to apartheid, particularly in higher education.

The university admitted its first small group of black students in the 1920s. The number of black students remained relatively low until the 1980s and 90s, when the institution, reading and welcoming the signs of change in the country, committed itself to a deliberate and planned process of internal transformation. From the 1980s to the early 1990s, the number of black students admitted to the university rose by 35 percent. By 2004, nearly half of UCT&#x27;s 20,000 students were black and just under half of the student body was female. Today the university boasts having one of the most diverse campuses in South Africa.

=== Post-Apartheid era ===

Rhodes Must Fall (#RhodesMustFall on social media) was a protest movement that began on 9 March 2015, originally directed against a statue at the University of Cape Town (UCT) that commemorates Cecil Rhodes. The campaign for the statue&#x27;s removal received global attention and led to a wider movement to &quot;decolonise&quot; education across South Africa. On 9 April 2015, following a UCT Council vote the previous night, the statue was removed.

#FeesMustFall was a student protest movement which was arguably indirectly inspired by the RhodesMustFall. It formally began at the University of the Witwatersrand and spread to UCT and Rhodes University and then the rest of the South African universities. It called for the abolition of tuition fee increases for the 2016 academic year. Diverse demands arose such as the abolition of fees and decolonisation of higher education which led to substantial changes at South African public universities. At UCT, the Senate began a widespread curriculum reform process and the university began the process of the renaming of buildings on campus (the most notable example was when Jameson Hall was renamed to Sarah Baartman Hall in 2019).

In September 2019, Film and Media studies student Uyinene Mrwetyana went missing. After the community and police began searching, her body was discovered in the Cape Flats area of Cape Town and Luyanda Botha was arrested and convicted for her rape and murder. Her death and the rape and death of other women precipitated widespread public outcry that led to a campus shutdown and protests on campus, at the Parliament precinct in Cape Town CBD and at campuses around South Africa. Subsequently, President Ramaphosa announced reforms such as harsher punishments for sex offenders and the public disclosure of the National Register for Sex Offenders to stem sexual and physical violence against women and children. Moreover, the Uyinene Mrwetyana Foundation was established and a special fund in her name was created to provide scholarships to female students in the Humanities Faculty.

In March 2020, UCT opened the Neuroscience Institute at the Groote Schuur Hospital in collaboration with the Western Cape Provincial Government, the first dedicated cross- and interdisciplinary centre for the study of and development of treatments for neurological and mental disorders in Africa.

== Campus ==
The main teaching campus, known as Upper Campus, is located on the Rhodes Estate on the slopes of Devil&#x27;s Peak. This campus contains, in a relatively compact site, the faculties of Science, Engineering, Commerce, and Humanities (except for the arts departments), as well as Smuts Hall and Fuller Hall residences. Upper Campus is centered on Sarah Baartman Hall, the location for graduation and other ceremonial events, as well as many examinations. The original buildings and layout of Upper Campus were designed by JM Solomon and built between 1928 and 1930. Since that time, many more buildings have been added as the university has grown. Upper Campus is also home to the main library, The Chancellor Oppenheimer Library, which holds the majority of the university&#x27;s 1.3 million volume collection.

Contiguous with Upper Campus, but separated from it by university sports fields and the M3 expressway, are the Middle and Lower Campuses. These campuses, which are spread through the suburbs of Rondebosch, Rosebank and Mowbray, contain the Law Faculty, the South African College of Music, the School of Economics, most of the student residences, most of the university administrative offices, and various sporting facilities. The state of the art artificial grass soccer field has been approved by FIFA for training for World Cup teams. The Upper, Middle and Lower Campuses together are often referred to as the &quot;main campus&quot;.

The Faculty of Health Sciences is located on the Medical School campus next to the Groote Schuur Hospital in Observatory. The Fine Arts and Drama departments are located on the Hiddingh Campus in central Cape Town. The university&#x27;s original building, now known as the &quot;Egyptian Building&quot;, on the Hiddingh campus, was built in the Egyptian Revival style. The only other campus built in this style was the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond, Virginia in the United States. The UCT Graduate School of Business is located on the Breakwater Lodge Campus at the Victoria &amp; Alfred Waterfront.

The Baxter Theatre Centre, located on the Lower Campus, is part of the University of Cape Town; it is also the second largest performing arts complex in Cape Town, after the Artscape Theatre Centre. It has three venues:
*the 665-seat Main Theatre
*the 638-seat Concert Hall, with a Von Beckerath organ
*the 172-seat Golden Arrow Studio

For his contribution of the tract of land which the campus was founded on, a bronze statue of Cecil Rhodes was erected in 1934 on the Upper Campus, overlooking the university&#x27;s rugby fields. The statue was removed in April 2015 following pressure from student groups due to its representation of South Africa&#x27;s colonialist apartheid past and the university&#x27;s inadequate representation of black students, faculty, and staff.

The upper campus was affected by the Table Mountain fire in April 2021; the Jagger Library building, which housed rare books and documents including a large African Studies collection, was gutted.

===Residential halls===
The university has 19 student residences (or &quot;res&quot; as known colloquially), offering both single-gender and mixed-gender housing. The Department of Student Housing oversees the residence system College House is the oldest university residence in Africa, having been established in 1887. UCT&#x27;s residence system is composed of three tiers. Students living in residence are placed in a tier according to the length of time that they have been in the residence system, studying in the university and service or part-time employment in a residence. As a student progresses through their academic journey they are moved into a higher tier. Postgraduate students are usually housed in the third-tier residences unless employed in lower-tier residences.

==Organisation==
===Administration and governance===

The University of Cape Town was originally incorporated as a public university by a private act of Parliament, the University of Cape Town Act, 1916 (No. 14 of 1916) in 1918. At present it is incorporated and structured by an institutional statute issued under the provisions of the Higher Education Act, 1997.

The titular head of the university is the chancellor; this is a ceremonial position without executive power. The primary role of the chancellor is to confer degrees on behalf of the university, and to represent the university to the rest of the world. The current Chancellor is fashion entrepreneur and philanthropist Precious Moloi-Motsepe who was elected in November 2019 and assumed the role on 1 January 2020 after the expiration of Ms Graça Machel&#x27;s second consecutive 10-year term.

The University Council is the highest ranked decision-making and appointative structure in the university. With wide-ranging powers of governance over areas such as the strategy, well-being and mission of the university, it is directly accountable to the Government of the Republic through the Minister of Higher Education, currently Nobuhle Nkabane for matters relating to the university. It is composed of 30 broad stakeholder representatives such as students, academics, staff and appointees of the City of Cape Town, Convocation, Premier of the Western Cape and the Minister of Higher Education among others, and the presiding officer of the council, the chair, is currently Mr Norman Arendse (SC). The Registrar, who acts as the secretary of the Council and Senate, oversees academic registration and legal matters, and administers the Convocation, is currently Royston Pillay.

The Convocation, composed of alumni, the Vice Chancellor, Deputy Vice Chancellors, academic staff, emeritus professors and emeritus associate professors, is a statutory body administered by the Office of the Registrar, which provides a platform for former members of the university to participate and engage with matters affecting the university. Helmed by the President of the Convocation, currently Mr Kassi Carl Manlan, it can make recommendations and pass non-binding resolutions in its Annual General Meetings.

The Leadership Lekgotla is a coordinating and decision-making structure composed of senior executives of the university who oversee the day-to-day running of the university. It contrasts with the University Council which arises from the University Statute and exercises supreme governance over the university. The Leadership Lekgotla&#x27;s members are senior executives who oversee different areas of the university&#x27;s operations and policies.  The most senior executive is the Vice Chancellor (ranked below the Chancellor in the ceremonial protocol and order of precedence of the university) is the de facto head and chief executive of the university, (currently held by Mosa Moshabela), who is accountable to the council. Below the Vice Chancellor are the Deputy Vice Chancellors of Transformation (currently Professor Elelwani Ramugondo), of Research and Internationalisation (currently Susanne Harris) and of Teaching and Learning (currently Professor Harsha Kathard, acting). The Chief Operations Officer, currently Reno Morar, brings together and oversees the functional, support and technical areas of the university&#x27;s operations.

=== Academic divisions===
The university is composed of six Faculties (Commerce, Engineering and the Built Environment, Health Sciences, Law, Sciences and Humanities) which together comprise 57 departments. Faculties are helmed by a Dean and their administrative and operational matters are administered by a Director. The Senate has delegated substantial powers to the faculties in academic matters over their internal protocol and management such as on matters concerning class timetables, admission requirements, academic exclusion, examinations, research projects and so on. Faculties vary substantially in student size and in buildings occupied, with the Commerce faculty having the highest student population and the law faculty having the lowest while the Humanities faculty spans the most buildings followed by the Faculty of Health Sciences with the Commerce and Law faculties having (by far) the lowest physical footprint.

Notwithstanding interdisciplinary research units and centers, additional academic structures exist that eschew the faculty-based organisational structure. The multidisciplinary Center for Higher Education Development ranks on an equal level as the faculties and the UCT Graduate School of Business maintains substantial latitude over its internal affairs despite being nominally part of the Faculty of Commerce. The interdisciplinary School of Information Technology, comprising the Departments of Information Systems and of Computer Science in the Commerce and Science faculties is neither a faculty nor a department but a coordinating mechanism to promote IT education and research.

== Funding ==

The university&#x27;s endowment (the financial capital and investment funds on which it can draw to carry out its work) is deposited with the UCT Foundation (a legally independent nonprofit organisation) and it is managed by the Investment Office. Through the Distinguishing UCT fundraising campaign, the university is trying to raise its endowment. As of 2019, its designated endowment stands at R2.5 billion and its undesignated endowment stands at R676 million with R133 million raised for infrastructure projects (bringing the total undesignated endowment to R809 million which the university aims to increase to R1 billion).

There have been several campaigns at the university to divest its endowment. Fossil Free UCT was formally established in 2015 as a campaign by environmental activism lobbying groups and student organisations, most notably the Green Campus Initiative compel UCT to divest from fossil fuel companies which resulted in a non-binding resolution passed by UCT&#x27;s Convocation in 2017 to support the divestment. Student lobby groups, most notably the Palestinian Solidarity Front and the SRC called on the university&#x27;s management to divest from Israeli companies and organisations working in the Palestinian Occupied Territories (among other demands), which, in the end, the university refused to do.

The university&#x27;s income comes from a combination of government grants, tuition fees, donations, investment and research income. In the 2017–2018 financial year, the university received R1.415 billion in state subsidies, R1.428 billion in tuition fees and R539 million in other income. R1.2 billion was committed to student financial aid for both undergraduate and postgraduate students from the university, the government through the NSFAS scheme and the university&#x27;s partners and donors.

== Students and staff ==

, there were 27,907 students; 25% of whom were black South African, 22% were white South African, 18% identified as another race, 15% were international students. In 2016 there were 29,074 students enrolled (18,421 undergraduates and 10,653 postgraduates) and 4,542 staff were employed (1,179 academic and 3,363 professional, administrative, support and service staff).

The UCT Employment Equity Plan April (2010 to 2015) indicated moderate but consistent changes in the demographic makeup of the staff body. The five-year plan specified specific targets ranging from between about 5% to 10% adjustments in the representation of SA black staff. According to the plan the staff makeup would have changed by 2015 by achieving either parity or more SA black staff than SA white in all categories other than senior lecturer and professor positions.

UCT spokesperson Elijah Moholola noted that, in 2017, UCT employed 45 white professors, 38 black African, Cape Coloured or Indian South African professors, 67 foreign national professors and 7 who did not disclose their race.

== Student life ==
UCT had 36 different sports clubs in 2003, including team sports, individual sports, extreme sports and martial arts.

The university&#x27;s sports teams, in particular the rugby union team, are known as the &quot;Ikey Tigers&quot; or the &quot;Ikeys&quot;. The &quot;Ikey&quot; nickname originated in the 1910s as an antisemitic epithet applied to UCT students by the students of Stellenbosch University, because of the supposed large number of Jewish students at UCT. Stellenbosch is UCT&#x27;s traditional rugby opponent; an annual &quot;Intervarsity&quot; match is played between the two universities. The University of Cape Town Football Club also known as the &quot;Ikeys Warriors&quot; is the main team for association football (soccer), representing the university at tournaments such as Varsity Football.

As of 2007 there were more than 80 student societies at UCT, falling into five categories: 
* Academic societies for those interested in a particular field of study or studying a particular topic: The most prominent of these include the History and Current Affairs Society (HCA), the Space and Astronomy Society (SpaceSoc, also a SEDS South Africa chapter), the United Nations Association of South Africa (UNASA), and the Students for Law and Social Justice (SLSJ).
* Political societies, including branches of the youth wings of national political parties such as the South African Students Congress (SASCO), the Democratic Alliance Students Organisation (DASO), and the African National Congress Youth League.
* Religious societies, some of which are associated with religious denominations or local places of worship.
* National/cultural societies for students from particular countries or particular ethnic backgrounds.
* Special interest societies (such as RainbowUCT, the university&#x27;s LGBTI society, UCT Mountain &amp; Ski Club, UCT Ballroom and Latin dancing) for those interested in various activities or issues.

In addition to the plethora of student societies, there are several student organisations dedicated to the development of communities surrounding the university in the Cape Metropolitan Area.

== Controversies ==

=== The &quot;Mafeje Affair&quot; ===
University of Cape Town Council&#x27;s decision to rescind Archie Mafeje&#x27;s (black) offer for a senior lecturer position due to pressure from the Apartheid government angered students and led to protests on 15 August 1968 followed by a nine days sit-in at UCT administration building. Protesters faced intimidation from the government, anti-protestors and fellow Afrikaans students from other universities. The police swiftly squashed support for the sit-in. In the aftermath, Mafeje left the country and did not return until 2000.

=== Rhodes Must Fall ===
A debate at UCT over the removal of a statue of Cecil Rhodes spawned Rhodes Must Fall movement. The FeesMustFall movement, which began at Wits and spread to UCT, was inspired by the Rhodes Must Fall protests.

=== Destruction and censorship of art ===
Since the removal of the Rhodes statue, other art has been removed or destroyed. FeesMustFall students burned 23 of the university&#x27;s historical paintings in February 2016.

According to GroundUp, art experts connected to the university are concerned about intolerance towards art at the institution, as UCT has removed and censored 75 further &quot;vulnerable&quot; art which it claims are offensive to students.

An Artworks Task Team was set up in September 2015 to assess art at the university &quot;with a view to transformation and inclusivity&quot;, and went about finding &quot;artworks on campus that may be seen to recognize or celebrate colonial oppressors and/or which may be offensive or controversial&quot;, and specifically artworks deemed to be &quot;offensive&quot; in their depiction of black people. Both Stanley Pinker&#x27;s &quot;Decline and Fall&quot;, which makes ironic use of colonial iconology, and Breyten Breytenbach&#x27;s &quot;Hovering Dog&quot;, which shows a black person wearing a white mask and a white person wearing a black mask, were removed; and Diane Victor&#x27;s &quot;Pasiphaë&quot;, which depicts black farmers with allusions to Greek mythology, was covered by a wooden panel. In response, Breyten Breytenbach remarked that UCT were making fools of themselves, while Diane Victor thought UCT&#x27;s actions were &quot;slightly comical&quot; and her artwork was being understood on a &quot;simplistic level&quot;.

Jacques Rousseau, then chair of the Academic Freedom Committee, told GroundUp: &quot;There are a number of artworks in UCT&#x27;s collection that could legitimately be regarded as problematic. Even so, any piece of art is potentially offensive to someone, and the very point of art is to provoke reflection and sometimes discomfort.&quot; The Academic Freedom Committee noted with &quot;grave concern recent instances of threats to academic freedom&quot;.

The South African Human Rights Commission was investigating the matter as of May 2017, in order to determine whether the university was infringing on the constitutional right to freedom of expression, in particular the right to artistic creativity.

== Popular culture ==
The university was the shooting location of the 2019 film &quot;Critters Attack!&quot; where it was called Leroy College and the 2008 film &quot;Disgrace&quot;.

The university was the shooting location of Netflix movies &quot;The Kissing Booth&quot; and &quot;The Kissing Booth 2&quot; and the 2020 Netflix series &quot;Blood &amp; Water&quot;. The Upper Campus residence served as the grounds and building for the show&#x27;s fictional Parkhurst College.
