<text>Carl Solomon (March 30, 1928 – February 26, 1993) was an American writer. One of his best-known pieces of writing is &quot;Report from the Asylum: Afterthoughts of a Shock Patient&quot;.

==Biography==
Solomon was born in the New York City borough of the Bronx. His father&#x27;s death in 1939 profoundly affected his early life. Solomon later said, &quot;I drifted into indiscipline and intellectual adventure that eventually became complete confusion.&quot; Graduating from high school at 15, Solomon attended the City College of New York (CCNY) for a short time before joining the United States Maritime Service in 1944. In his travels overseas, Solomon was exposed to Surrealism and Dada, which inspired him throughout his life. In Paris, he witnessed Antonin Artaud give a screaming poetry reading. This so impressed him that he remained a disciple of Artaud for much of his life. It was shortly after this period that Solomon was voluntarily institutionalized, a gesture he made as a Dadaist symbol of defeat.

Solomon first met Beat poet Allen Ginsberg in the waiting room of the New York State Psychiatric Institute. Ginsberg dedicated his 1955 poem &quot;Howl&quot; to Solomon. The poem&#x27;s third section uses the refrain &quot;I&#x27;m with you in Rockland&quot;, an institution Solomon never attended. Solomon had many complaints about Ginsberg and &quot;Howl&quot;, including that he was &quot;never in Rockland&quot; and that the third section of the poem &quot;garbles history completely&quot;. The reference to Rockland appears to be a poetic fabrication. Ginsberg likely used the name because it was more appropriate and emphatic than &quot;New York State Hospital&quot; or &quot;Pilgrim&quot; (Pilgrim Psychiatric Center, another psychiatric hospital to which Solomon was admitted). The poem&#x27;s first section immortalizes a few of Solomon&#x27;s personal exploits, such as the line &quot;who threw potato salad at CCNY lecturers on Dadaism and subsequently presented themselves on the granite steps of the madhouse with shaven heads and harlequin speech of suicide, demanding instantaneous lobotomy.&quot;

It was at Ginsberg&#x27;s insistence that William S. Burroughs&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Junkie&quot; (1953), was published by Ace Books. Solomon&#x27;s uncle, Aaron A. Wyn, owned Ace Books, a purveyor of pulp fiction and nonfiction paperbacks. Solomon worked for Ace and was responsible for the Publisher&#x27;s Note in the first printing of &quot;Junkie&quot;, as well as the Introduction to the 1964 reprinting.

One of Solomon&#x27;s best-known pieces of writing is &quot;Report from the Asylum: Afterthoughts of a Shock Patient&quot;. It is an account of the electroconvulsive therapy used to treat patients in asylums, drawn directly from personal experience. It was written with Artaud somewhat in mind, because he had received the same treatment while unjustly institutionalized by the French government. The piece was included in the 50th-anniversary &quot;Howl&quot; facsimile, in an appendix.

In the late 1960s, Solomon published two chapbooks of prose poetry with Mary Beach&#x27;s &quot;Beach Books, Texts &amp; Documents&quot;, distributed by City Lights Books: &quot;Mishaps, Perhaps&quot; (1966) and &quot;More Mishaps&quot; (1968). &quot;Emergency Messages&quot; (1989) features selections from the two books along with some of Solomon&#x27;s other autobiographical, critical and poetic writings. He was a frequent contributor to &quot;New Directions Annual&quot;, &quot;American Book Review&quot;, and &quot;The New Leader&quot;.

<text>Hollywood Pictures Company was an American film production label of Walt Disney Studios, founded and owned by The Walt Disney Company. Established in 1989, by Disney CEO Michael Eisner and studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg, Hollywood Pictures was founded to increase the film output of the Walt Disney Studios, and release films similar to those of Touchstone Pictures. These films, featuring more mature themes, were targeted at adult audiences unlike the family-oriented productions of the studio&#x27;s flagship Walt Disney Pictures division. After years of hiatus, the label was closed in 2007. The studio&#x27;s most commercially successful film was M. Night Shyamalan&#x27;s &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, which grossed over $670 million worldwide upon its release in 1999.

== History ==
Hollywood Pictures Corporation was incorporated on March 30, 1984, and was activated on February 1, 1989. Ricardo Mestres was appointed the division&#x27;s first president, moving from Disney&#x27;s Touchstone Pictures. The division was formed to create opportunities for up-and-coming executives and to double Disney&#x27;s feature-film output in order to fill the gap left by the contraction in the industry, which included the closure of MGM/UA&#x27;s United Artists and financial problems at Lorimar-Telepictures and De Laurentiis Entertainment Group. With Touchstone aligned with Hollywood Pictures, the two Disney production divisions would share the same marketing and distribution staffs. Hollywood Pictures was expected to be producing 12 films a year by 1991 and to share funding from the Silver Screen Partners IV. The company&#x27;s first release was &quot;Arachnophobia&quot; on July 18, 1990.

On October 23, 1990, The Walt Disney Company formed Touchwood Pacific Partners to supplant the Silver Screen Partnership series as their movie studios&#x27; primary funding source.

After the collapse of their then-recently renewed deal at Paramount Pictures, Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer moved their production company to Hollywood Pictures on January 18, 1991.

The division issued primarily inexpensive comedies for the first six years with a few box office flops, amongst them &quot;Holy Matrimony&quot;, &quot;Aspen Extreme&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, &quot;Swing Kids&quot;, &quot;Blame It on the Bellboy&quot;, &quot;Born Yesterday&quot; and &quot;Guilty as Sin&quot;. The division only had one box office success, &quot;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle&quot;, and one critical success, &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot;, which did not outweigh the general anemic box office record of the division. On April 26, 1994, Mestres was forced to resign after the lackluster performance of the division. Mestres moved to long term production deal with the studio.

On June 27, 1994, Michael Lynton was appointed as new division president after moving from the Disney Publishing Group, where he was senior vice president and oversaw domestic publishing units including Hyperion Books. Mestres left Lynton a few potential hits: Robert Redford&#x27;s &quot;Quiz Show&quot;, the Sarah Jessica Parker-Antonio Banderas comedy &quot;Miami Rhapsody&quot;, and &quot;Dangerous Minds&quot;, starring Michelle Pfeiffer. In 1997, Lynton left for a position at Penguin Group. When Lynton left, it was briefly transferred to a releasing-only entity, making pictures by third-parties, as well as Caravan Pictures, and Cinergi, and its development slate was transferred to Touchstone Pictures, but David Vogel, who was president of Walt Disney Pictures took on the studio by producing films again. In 1998, the three units were transferred to the Buena Vista Motion Picture Group, and its development slate of projects by Hollywood Pictures, such as &quot;Bicentennial Man&quot;, and &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; was transferred to Touchstone. By 2001, Hollywood Pictures had produced 80 films, but its operation had been phased out and its management was merged with that of the flagship Walt Disney Pictures studio.

After being dormant for five years, the brand was reactivated for low-budget genre films. Films released by the repurposed Hollywood Pictures were two horror films: &quot;Stay Alive&quot; (released on March 24, 2006), and &quot;Primeval&quot; (released on January 12, 2007), and one thriller, &quot;The Invisible&quot; (released on April 27, 2007). After the latter release, Disney stopped producing and distributing under the label as it announced a focus on the company&#x27;s core brands of Disney, Touchstone, ABC, ESPN, and Pixar.

<doc id="680632" wikidata="Q3569769" url="?curid=680632" title="Women's Premier Soccer League">
<text>The Women&#x27;s Premier Soccer League (WPSL) is an amateur women&#x27;s soccer league in the United States.

== History ==
The WPSL is the longest-running active women&#x27;s soccer league as it enters its 25th season in 2023. The WPSL is also the largest women&#x27;s soccer league in the United States, North America and the world with 130 active teams as of 2023.

The WPSL started as the Western Division of the W-League, before breaking away to form its own league in 1998. The league is sanctioned by the United States Adult Soccer Association, an affiliate of the United States Soccer Federation (USSF). WPSL teams feature collegiate and post-collegiate players, who currently or previously played across all divisions of the NCAA, NAIA, and NJCAA. Former players of the WPSL have taken their playing careers to the next level by signing professional in the NWSL and top leagues overseas. WPSL Alumnae have also reached international status by making international rosters seen in the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup and the Olympics. Notable alumnae include Brandi Chastain, Kristine Lilly, Heather Mitts, Julie Foudy, Shannon Boxx, Alex Morgan and Leslie Osborne. The Jerry Zanelli Cup is awarded to the champion of each WPSL season.

When Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer (WPS) suspended play in 2012, WPSL moved forward with its ambitions toward professionalism and created the WPSL Elite League. The Elite League was a pro-am league, with at least four fully professional teams, including three former WPS teams. The Elite league operated for just the 2012 season, disbanding in 2013 with the formation of the NWSL, which the three former WPS teams joined.

=== WPSL Division II ===
In 2021, the WPSL announced its second division, WPSL U21, which is scheduled to begin play in mid-2021. In September 2024, WPSL announced a change to the WPSL U21 program, evolving it to the WPSL Division II, which provides a pathway for higher developmental opportunities. The new division is set to launch in 2025, with an emphasis on competition and standards through a fully connected developmental program.

=== WPSL PRO ===
On February 8, 2023, WPSL announced plans to create a Division III professional league named WPSL PRO. The league plans to start in 2025 with ten teams. In August 2023, five teams signed letters of intent to join the WPSL Pro. SouthStar FC, Sioux Falls City FC, Oklahoma City FC (WPSL), Austin Rise FC, and The Town FC will be five of the first ten teams to join WPSL Pro. On February 6, 2024, the league announced the sixth team will be Georgia Impact FC. The league needs six teams to conform with US Soccer Division III Professional League Standards On February 20, 2024, the league announced the seventh team signing a letter of intent was AC Houston Sur for the 2025 season. On February 22, 2024, the league announced the first team signing a letter of intent for the 2026 season was Dakota Fusion FC. To celebrate Women&#x27;s History Month, WPSL Pro revealed it&#x27;s temporary branding and new website. The league confirmed they would reveal their official branding later in the year. In July 2024, WPSL Pro announced their ninth LOI from a group led by Gina Prodan Kelly to bring a club to Northeast Ohio. WPSL Pro reached the milestone of their 10th LOI from Soda City FC from Columbia, South Carolina, in August 2024. In September 2024, WPSL Pro announced their 11th and 12th LOIs, the first from Wichita, Kansas, and the second Indios Denver FC from Denver, Colorado.

===League Affiliations===
On April 2, 2024, WPSL announced they had partnered with the Michigan Super League to provide support to the development of underrepresented leagues. The WPSL will partner with the United States Adult Soccer Association to provide support to these leagues. The Michigan Super League will consist of five teams for the 2024 season. On January 3, 2025, WPSL announced a partnership with Gulf Coast Premier League (GCPL). This partnership will have 8 of the 12 top GCPL teams form the Gulf Coast Conference for the 2025 season, allowing for the opportunity to participate in regional and national play-offs.

<text>Blackbird Creek is a river in northern Delaware in the United States.

==Course==

Blackbird Creek Reserve is on the Delaware Bayshore Byway and includes trails, pavilion and canoe/kayak launch. The reserve boasts several miles of trails through uplands and along the marsh, restoration demonstration areas as well as a variety of programs and volunteer opportunities for the community, teachers, students, and families.
Blackbird Creek rises in two branches both north and south of Dexter Corners in southern New Castle County, Delaware and flows generally northeast in a meandering course. The northerly branch is contained within Blackbird State Forest, while the southerly branch arises in a swampy wooded buffer in farmland. Both branches join just upstream of Blackbird Pond, which is southwest of the village of Blackbird, Delaware. Just downstream of Blackbird Pond and upstream of US 13, Barlow Branch enters from the left (north). Downstream of US 13, Sandom Branch enters from the right (south) and a little further downstream, Blackbird Creek becomes subject to tidal influence and widens considerably.

Upstream of Blackbird Landing Road, Herring Run enters from the left (north) in an area of freshwater tidal marsh. Downstream of Blackbird Landing Road, another tributary, Beaver Branch, enters from the left (north). Near the mouth of Blackbird Creek, three tidal tributaries enter from the right (south) and include Fishing Creek, Mill Creek, and Gravel Gut. The mouth of Blackbird Creek is located at the north end of Delaware Bay approximately south of the mouth of the Appoquinimink River and approximately north of Taylors Bridge.

==Watershed==

Blackbird Creek watershed is largely forested and rural. Near its mouth, it is surrounded by extensive salt marshes, with extensive populations of saltmarsh cordgrass (&quot;Spartina alterniflora&quot;) and common reed (&quot;Phragmites australis&quot;). The lower river upstream from Delaware State Highway 9 is protected as part of the Delaware National Estuarine Research Reserve, along with portions of the lower Appoquinimink. Blackbird State Forest covers large areas of the headwaters. One small village, Blackbird, is located totally within the watershed, while the city of Townsend is on the northern edge.

==River Modifications==

Blackbird Pond, a former millpond, is the only dam present on Blackbird Creek.

The damming of this creek was the subject of the 1829 Supreme Court case that gave rise to the theory of the Dormant Commerce Clause.

==Natural History==

 The Blackbird Creek watershed is a focus area in Delaware for “Delmarva Bays”, which are undrained depression deposits that may or may not have a sandy rim. These “bays” have fluctuating hydrology that provide breeding sites for amphibians and habitat for a number of rare plants. Larger versions are generally called “Carolina Bays.”

==Geology==

Blackbird Creek is located in the High Coastal Plain that originates from glacial outwash of continental deposits (Columbia Formation). The headwaters of Blackbird Creek are located in an area of undrained depression deposits of the Columbia Formation. The northeasterly course of Blackbird Creek takes it through the Lynch Heights Formation, Scotts Corners Formation, and into marsh deposits forming steep valleys along the way.

<text>&quot;Star of the County Down&quot; (Roud 4801) is an Irish ballad set near Banbridge in County Down, Northern Ireland. The words are by Cathal MacGarvey (1866–1927) from Ramelton, County Donegal. MacGarvey&#x27;s song was first collected in Herbert Hughes &quot; Irish Country Songs&quot;. The tune is traditional, and may be known as &quot;Dives and Lazarus&quot; or (as a hymn tune) &quot;Kingsfold&quot;.

The melody was also used in an Irish folk song called &quot;My Love Nell&quot;. The lyrics of &quot;My Love Nell&quot; tell the story of a young man who courts a girl but loses her when she emigrates to America. The only real similarity with &quot;Star of the County Down&quot; is that Nell too comes from County Down. This may have inspired MacGarvey to place the heroine of his new song in Down as well. MacGarvey was from Donegal. The chorus of a similar song, &quot;The Flower of the County Down&quot; names landmarks local to Down, in contrast to those in &quot;Star&quot; which are from across Ireland.

&quot;The Star of the County Down&quot; uses a tight rhyme scheme. Each stanza is a double quatrain, and the first and third lines of each quatrain have an internal rhyme on the second and fourth feet: [aa]b[cc]b. The refrain is a single quatrain with the same rhyming pattern.

The song is sung from the point of view of a young man who chances to meet a charming lady by the name of Rose (or Rosie) McCann, referred to as the &quot;star of the County Down&quot;. From a brief encounter the writer&#x27;s infatuation grows until, by the end of the ballad, he imagines himself marrying the girl.

<text>ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited (or simply ANZ) is a New Zealand banking and financial services company, which operates as a subsidiary of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited of Australia. ANZ is one of New Zealand&#x27;s big four banks, and is the largest bank in New Zealand with approximately 30% of market share as of March 2021. 

Australia and New Zealand Banking Group bought the National Bank of New Zealand from Lloyds Bank in 2003. The banks operated as separate brands until 2012, when they were unified under the ANZ brand. The company was renamed ANZ Bank New Zealand in 2012, following the withdrawal of the National Bank brand. ANZ provides a number of financial services, including banking services, asset finance, investments and payment services.

==History==
===19th century===
In 1840, Union Bank of Australia (UBA), a British bank with head office in London, agreed with the New Zealand Company to accompany settlers to New Zealand to provide them with banking services. UBA opened a branch in Petone, across the harbour from Wellington, where it transferred the branch shortly thereafter. Between 1840 and 1847 the Union Bank issued its own bank notes for circulation in New Zealand. These were initially issued under British law until 1844 when the New Zealand Governor signed an ordinance allowing the Bank to issue bank notes but required that these be a minimum of 1 pound and redeemable at demand for gold or silver.

In 1848, The Governor withdrew Union Bank&#x27;s right to issue bank notes and transferred these rights to the Colonial Bank of Issue (CBI). UBA notes in circulation were withdrawn and replaced with CBI bank notes. UBA objected, and every day it took whatever CBI notes it had received that day to the CBI and demanded redemption in gold; when UBA&#x27;s customers wanted to withdraw money, the bank paid them in gold rather than CBI notes. This policy, when combined with previous confusion related to the issue of NZ Government debt, and support from the local commercial community, resulted in the CBI ultimately being shut down. The same year, UBA opened a branch in Auckland, and a small number of branches elsewhere in the country followed. The following year, UBC resumed issuing bank notes in New Zealand under an act of the New Zealand Parliament. (The Paper Currency Act 1856). In 1864, Bank of Australasia, another London-based bank, opened branches in Auckland, Dunedin and Christchurch.

===20th century===
In 1951, UBA and the Bank of Australasia merged to become the Australia and New Zealand Bank. In 1968, ANZ Bank joined Databank Systems Limited consortium to provide joint data processing services. Two years later, ANZ Bank merged with a third London-based bank, the English, Scottish and Australian Bank, to form ANZ Banking Group. In 1976, ANZ moved its corporate headquarters to Melbourne, Australia. In 1979, An Act of Parliament permitted ANZ to incorporate its branches in New Zealand as ANZ Banking Group (New Zealand) Ltd. ANZ sold 25% of the shares to the public. In 1983, ANZ opened its New Zealand head office in Wellington. In 1989, ANZ bought PostBank (the Post Office Savings Bank) from the New Zealand government in a privatization. Two years earlier, the Government had separated the Post Office&#x27;s banking business into a separate entity to prepare it for sale. In 1999, ANZ launched internet banking.

===21st century===
In 2002, ING and ANZ formed a joint venture under the ING brand The following year, ANZ bought National Bank of New Zealand from Lloyds TSB. In 2008, ANZ launched a mobile application. The same year, ANZ announced around 400 jobs were to be moved to Bangalore, India. 

In 2009, ANZ Group CEO Mike Smith announced the Group&#x27;s &quot;super regional strategy&quot;, saying the Bank aims to not be &quot;Kiwi&quot; or &quot;Australian&quot; but a global bank. In September 2010, ANZ New Zealand became the sole owner of ING New Zealand Limited, which formed part of ING; ING provided investment advice for the investment and insurance products sold by ANZ and The National Bank. ING New Zealand Limited changed its name to OnePath Limited in November 2010. The same year, David Hisco replaces outgoing Jenny Fagg as CEO ANZ New Zealand. On 26 September 2012, ANZ National Bank CEO David Hisco announced that the National Bank would re-brand as &quot;ANZ&quot; by the end of October. The name of the company would change to &quot;ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited&quot;. The technology of the two banks was brought together from 29 October 2012, with customers being able to use branches branded ANZ or the National Bank from the same date. Branches branded the National Bank would change to the ANZ branding before the bank&#x27;s trademark license expired in 2014. In May 2019, the Reserve Bank stripped ANZ of its accreditation to set and manage its capital reserves over persistent failures since 2014.
In 2013, Onepath rebranded as ANZ Investments. In 2014, ANZ India got approval from Reserve Bank of India to open two branches in India. In 2015, ANZ announced ANZ ETFS joint venture with ETF Securities to offer 6 ETFs on ASX. In 2017, ANZ announced it would sell its online sharebroking service, Direct Broking, to investment bank, First NZ Capital (FNZC), for an undisclosed sum. The sale was completed in December 2018. In 2019, Antonia Watson replaced David Hisco as CEO of ANZ NZ.

In 2020, ANZ sold UDC Finance for $794 million to Shinsei Bank.

== Operations ==

=== Personal banking ===

As a part of ANZ&#x27;s personal banking services, the bank offers a number of different bank accounts, personal loans, home loans, a wealth management service, insurance and investment services.

==== Investment ====
ANZ Investments, is ANZ&#x27;s subsidiary (previously ING) that manages investments. Currently it is the largest fund manager in NZ with approximately 745,000 customers. It is one of the nine Kiwisaver scheme managers appointed by the New Zealand Government in 2014.

==== Insurance ====
ANZ offers a number of insurance products through partnerships with different insurance companies including life and living insurance (Cigna Insurance), house insurance (Vero), contents insurance (Vero), car insurance (Vero) and travel insurance (Allianz Australia). The bank used to offer credit card repayment insurance, however since 2020, it no longer provides new policies.

==== Wealth management ====
ANZ has a wealth management service called private bank. The service provides investment management services, lending services (for personal, investment and commercial property loans), foreign currency accounts and services for foreign investors.

== Advertising and sponsorship ==
ANZ NZ sponsors a number of sporting entities and charities including New Zealand Cricket, Netball New Zealand, Paralympics New Zealand, the New Zealand Olympic Committee and the New Zealand Cancer Society. As of 2020, ANZ NZ donates NZ$15 million annually.

In 2017, ANZ spent $25 million on advertising annually, higher than any other bank in New Zealand.

=== 2016 Olympic Games ===
For the 2016 Olympic Games, the New Zealand Olympic Committee and ANZ NZ developed a cross platform mobile app to cover the game. During this advertising campaign, which featured heavy ANZ branding, the company experienced a 2 basis point increase in brand consideration.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, ANZ NZ donated $2 million to the Women’s Refuge, Age Concern New Zealand, the Salvation Army, Red Cross and local charities in the Pacific, in addition to a $1 million grant to cricket and netball.

== Controversies ==

=== Hisco personal expenses ===
An internal review, by ANZ&#x27;s integrity unit, found that former CEO David Hisco was charging chauffeur driven cars and wine storage as expenses without authorisation. The report also found that the CEO &quot;took actions that reduced the likelihood of the personal expenses being detected, and did not report the benefit associated with the expenses&quot;.

=== Hisco family house purchase ===
In 2011, ANZ purchased a property in Auckland for $7.5 million and rented it to its then-CEO David Hisco free of charge. In 2017, the property was sold to Hisco&#x27;s wife for $6.9 million when the property&#x27;s capital value was $10.7 million according to quotable value data. While a Deloitte review cleared ANZ of wrongdoing, the Financial Markets Authority determined that the sale should have been disclosed in ANZ&#x27;s financial statements.

=== RBNZ censuring ===
In May 2019, the Reserve Bank revoked ANZ&#x27;s accreditation to model its own capital requirements due to &quot;persistent failure in its control and attenuation process&quot;. Consequently ANZ is required to use a standardised model and to increase its minimum capital held by approximately 60% to $760 million. A Deloitte review found that &quot;a historically complacent approach, the absence of a comprehensive compliance plan, diffused accountability and inadequate assurance processes, all contributed to the operational risk capital breach not being identified for more than five years&quot;. Although the RBNZ placed the responsibility on the directors, ANZ Chairman Sir John Key, maintains that the mistake was made by a junior employee.

=== Credit card repayment insurance ===
The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) accused ANZ NZ of issuing duplicate credit card repayment insurance policies to customers and failing to cancel policies for ineligible customers. The 390 customers with duplicate policies were still charged for the policies even though they provided no benefit. ANZ NZ acknowledged the bank took too long to report the issue to the FMA and attributed the issue to human error and systems issues. The bank has since issued an apology and compensation of NZD $440,000 to affected customers, however the bank still faces High Court proceedings from the FMA.

==Criticism==
ANZ has often been a finalist for the Roger Awards, which recognise &quot;The Worst Transnational Corporation[s] operating in New Zealand&quot; and are run by CAFCA and GATT Watchdog. Reports released by CAFCA criticised ANZ NZ for:

* The highest gross interest margin in 2009 (in the aftermath of the global financial crisis) out of the largest four banks operating in NZ (ANZ, Westpac, BNZ and ASB Bank). ANZ had a gross interest margin of 35.4% compared to Westpac (31%) and BNZ (30.3%).
* A high floating mortgage rate of 6.06% in 2009 compared to Westpac (5.69%) and BNZ (5.59%).

<doc id="680669" wikidata="Q3406536" url="?curid=680669" title="Tikanga Māori">
<text>Tikanga is a Māori term for Māori law, customary law, attitudes and principles, and also for the indigenous legal system which all iwi abided by prior to the colonisation of New Zealand. Te Aka Māori Dictionary defines it as &quot;customary system of values and practices that have developed over time and are deeply embedded in the social context&quot;. More broadly since the decline of tikanga Māori as New Zealand&#x27;s &quot;first law&quot; in favour of English law, tikanga has often been defined as a concept incorporating practices and values from mātauranga Māori, or Māori knowledge. Tikanga is translated into the English language with a wide range of meanings—culture, custom, ethic, etiquette, fashion, formality, lore, manner, meaning, mechanism, method, protocol, and style.

== Opinions ==
Māori scholar Hirini Moko Mead states that tikanga can be viewed from several perspectives. One view is that tikanga Māori &#x27;controls interpersonal relationships&#x27; as it guides the interactions of meetings, and provides identity to individuals. Another view is through ethics, that tikanga Māori is a practised code of conduct. The word tikanga is derived from the Māori word &quot;tika&quot; meaning &#x27;right&#x27; or &#x27;correct&#x27; so it follows that it involves moral judgements about what is the right way of doing something. Speaking on the pertinence of tikanga as a legitimate legal system, scholar Carwyn Jones has argued that the Treaty of Waitangi &quot;was signed within the context of Māori legal systems&quot;, and that tikanga is inextricably linked to the concept of mana. 

Scholars of Māori legal history view tikanga as having once been the law of the land. Lawyers view contemporary tikanga Māori through the lens of customary law, which comes from an authority rather than a normative system. This is being tested in the New Zealand judicial system through a few legal cases. For an interpretation of the conflicts between Tikanga Maori and Western/Pākehā jurisprudence, see the case of the burial of James Takamore (2011). In the course of her judgement on that case, Chief Justice of New Zealand Sian Elias stated that &quot;Māori custom according to tikanga is... part of the values of the New Zealand common law.&quot; Justice Joe Williams has written and studied tikanga and the New Zealand law. In his future vision there is a phase &quot;when tikanga Māori fuses with New Zealand’s common law tradition to form a hybrid law of Aotearoa that could be developed by judges, case by base.&quot;

From about the 1980s the word tikanga began to appear in common New Zealand English. This can be attributed to the Māori renaissance as well as acts of the New Zealand government including the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975 and the Resource Management Act (1991) that include the need for separate consultation with local &quot;iwi&quot; (tribal) representatives. 

In March 2001, the New Zealand Law Commission released a report on the influence of tikanga Māori on Pākehā (English) law conventions.

On 2 July 2011, the Waitangi Tribunal released its report into the Wai 262 claim, &quot;Ko Aotearoa Tēnei&quot; (&quot;This is Aotearoa (New Zealand)&quot;). The report considers more than 20 Government departments and agencies and makes recommendations as to reforms of &quot;laws, policies or practices relating to health, education, science, intellectual property, indigenous flora and fauna, resource management, conservation, the Māori language, arts and culture, heritage, and the involvement of Māori in the development of New Zealand’s positions on international instruments affecting indigenous rights.&quot; The second volume of the report contains a glossary of te reo Māori terms, including:
* tikanga: &quot;traditional rules for conducting life, custom, method, rule, law&quot;
* tikanga Māori: &quot;Māori traditional rules, culture&quot;
An example of applied tikanga is an approach by Māori weavers in the gathering of traditional materials such as harakeke. One tikanga is to never cut the inside leaves of the plant, the names of these leaves are the &quot;rito&quot; and this is metaphorically linked to growth of humans. Practically it ensures the life cycle of the plant, that the harvesting of the fibre does not kill the plant and it also connects the value of the resource to the people that use it.

<text>In graph theory, a critical graph is an undirected graph all of whose proper subgraphs have smaller chromatic number. In such a graph, every vertex or edge is a critical element, in the sense that its deletion would decrease the number of colors needed in a graph coloring of the given graph. Each time a single edge or vertex (along with its incident edges) is removed from a critical graph, the decrease in the number of colors needed to color that graph cannot be by more than one.

== Variations ==
A &quot;formula_1-critical graph&quot; is a critical graph with chromatic number formula_1. A graph formula_3 with chromatic number formula_1 is &quot;formula_1-vertex-critical&quot; if each of its vertices is a critical element. Critical graphs are the &quot;minimal&quot; members in terms of chromatic number, which is a very important measure in graph theory.

Some properties of a formula_1-critical graph formula_3 with formula_8 vertices and formula_9 edges:
* formula_3 has only one component. 
* formula_3 is finite (this is the De Bruijn–Erdős theorem).
* The minimum degree formula_12 obeys the inequality formula_13. That is, every vertex is adjacent to at least formula_14 others. More strongly, formula_3 is formula_16-edge-connected.
* If formula_3 is a regular graph with degree formula_14, meaning every vertex is adjacent to exactly formula_14 others, then formula_3 is either the complete graph formula_21 with formula_22 vertices, or an odd-length cycle graph. This is Brooks&#x27; theorem.
* formula_23.
* formula_24.
* Either formula_3 may be decomposed into two smaller critical graphs, with an edge between every pair of vertices that includes one vertex from each of the two subgraphs, or formula_3 has at least formula_27 vertices. More strongly, either formula_3 has a decomposition of this type, or for every vertex formula_29 of formula_3 there is a formula_1-coloring in which formula_29 is the only vertex of its color and every other color class has at least two vertices.

Graph formula_3 is vertex-critical if and only if for every vertex formula_29, there is an optimal proper coloring in which formula_29 is a singleton color class.

As showed, every formula_1-critical graph may be formed from a complete graph formula_21 by combining the Hajós construction with an operation that identifies two non-adjacent vertices. The graphs formed in this way always require formula_1 colors in any proper coloring.

A double-critical graph is a connected graph in which the deletion of any pair of adjacent vertices decreases the chromatic number by two. It is an open problem to determine whether formula_21 is the only double-critical formula_1-chromatic graph.

<doc id="680674" wikidata="Q533505" url="?curid=680674" title="Wendell Berry">
<text>Wendell Erdman Berry (born August 5, 1934) is an American novelist, poet, essayist, environmental activist, cultural critic, and farmer. Closely identified with rural Kentucky, Berry developed many of his agrarian themes in the early essays of &quot;The Gift of Good Land&quot; (1981) and &quot;The Unsettling of America&quot; (1977). His attention to the culture and economy of rural communities is also found in the novels and stories of Port William, such as &quot;A Place on Earth&quot; (1967), &quot;Jayber Crow&quot; (2000), and &quot;That Distant Land&quot; (2004).

He is an elected member of the Fellowship of Southern Writers, a recipient of the National Humanities Medal, and the Jefferson Lecturer for 2012. He is also a 2013 Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and, since 2014, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Berry was named the recipient of the 2013 Richard C. Holbrooke Distinguished Achievement Award. On January 28, 2015, he became the first living writer to be inducted into the Kentucky Writers Hall of Fame.

==Life==
Berry was the first of four children to be born to John Marshall Berry, a lawyer and tobacco farmer in Henry County, Kentucky, and Virginia Erdman Berry. The families of both parents had farmed in Henry County for at least five generations. Berry attended secondary school at Millersburg Military Institute and then earned a B.A. (1956) and M.A. (1957) in English at the University of Kentucky. In 1956, at the University of Kentucky he met another Kentucky writer-to-be, Gurney Norman. He completed his M.A. and married Tanya Amyx in 1957. In 1958, he attended Stanford University&#x27;s creative writing program as a Wallace Stegner Fellow, studying under Stegner in a seminar that included Larry McMurtry, Robert Stone, Ernest Gaines, Tillie Olsen, and Ken Kesey. Berry&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Nathan Coulter&quot;, was published in April 1960.

A Guggenheim Fellowship took Berry and his family to Italy and France in 1961, where he came to know Wallace Fowlie, critic and translator of French literature. From 1962 to 1964, he taught English at New York University&#x27;s University Heights campus in the Bronx. In 1964, he began teaching creative writing at the University of Kentucky, from which he resigned in 1977. During this time in Lexington, he came to know author Guy Davenport, as well as author and monk Thomas Merton and photographer Ralph Eugene Meatyard.

On July 4, 1965, Berry, his wife, and his two children moved to Lane&#x27;s Landing, a that he had purchased, and began growing corn and small grains on what eventually became a homestead of about . They bought their first flock of seven Border Cheviot sheep in 1978. Lane&#x27;s Landing is in Henry County in north central Kentucky near Port Royal, and his parents&#x27; birthplaces, and is on the western bank of the Kentucky River, not far from where it flows into the Ohio River. Berry has farmed, resided, and written at Lane&#x27;s Landing ever since. He has written about his early experiences on the land and about his decision to return to it in essays such as &quot;The Long-Legged House&quot; and &quot;A Native Hill&quot;.

From 1977 until 1980, he edited and wrote for Rodale, Inc. in Emmaus, Pennsylvania, including for its publications &quot;Organic Gardening and Farming&quot; and &quot;The New Farm&quot;. From 1987 to 1993, he returned to the English Department of the University of Kentucky. Berry has written at least twenty-five books (or chapbooks) of poems, twenty-four volumes of essays, and fifteen novels and short story collections. His writing is grounded in the notion that one&#x27;s work ought to be rooted in and responsive to one&#x27;s place.

==Activism==
Berry delivered &quot;A Statement Against the War in Vietnam&quot; during the Kentucky Conference on the War and the Draft on February 10, 1968, at the University of Kentucky in Lexington:

He debated former Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz at Manchester University in North Manchester, Indiana in November 1977. In this debate Berry defended the longstanding structure of small family farms and rural communities that were being replaced by what Butz saw as the achievements of industrial agriculture. &quot;My basic assumption when talking about agriculture is that there&#x27;s more to it than just agriculture. That you can&#x27;t disconnect one part of a society from all the other parts and just look at the results and that alone.&quot;

On June 3, 1979, Berry engaged in nonviolent civil disobedience against the construction of a nuclear power plant at Marble Hill, Indiana. He describes &quot;this nearly eventless event&quot; and expands upon his reasons for it in the essay &quot;The Reactor and the Garden.&quot;

On February 9, 2003, Berry&#x27;s essay titled &quot;A Citizen&#x27;s Response to the National Security Strategy of the United States&quot; was published as a full-page advertisement in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Berry opened the essay—a critique of the George W. Bush administration&#x27;s post-9/11 international strategy—by asserting that &quot;The new National Security Strategy published by the White House in September 2002, if carried out, would amount to a radical revision of the political character of our nation.&quot;

On January 4, 2009, Berry and Wes Jackson, president of The Land Institute, published an op-ed article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; titled &quot;A 50-Year Farm Bill.&quot; In July 2009 Berry, Jackson and Fred Kirschenmann, of The Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture, gathered in Washington DC to promote this idea. Berry and Jackson wrote, &quot;We need a 50-year farm bill that addresses forthrightly the problems of soil loss and degradation, toxic pollution, fossil-fuel dependency and the destruction of rural communities.&quot;

Also in January 2009, Berry released a statement against the death penalty, which began, &quot;As I am made deeply uncomfortable by the taking of a human life before birth, I am also made deeply uncomfortable by the taking of a human life after birth.&quot; And in November 2009, Berry and 38 other writers from Kentucky wrote to Gov. Steve Beshear and Attorney General Jack Conway asking them to impose a moratorium on the death penalty in that state.

On March 2, 2009, Berry joined over 2,000 others in non-violently blocking the gates to a coal-fired power plant in Washington, D.C. No one was arrested.

On May 22, 2009, Berry, at a listening session in Louisville, spoke against the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). He said, &quot;If you impose this program on the small farmers, who are already overburdened, you&#x27;re going to have to send the police for me. I&#x27;m 75 years old. I&#x27;ve about completed my responsibilities to my family. I&#x27;ll lose very little in going to jail in opposition to your program – and I&#x27;ll have to do it. Because I will be, in every way that I can conceive of, a non-cooperator.&quot;

In October 2009, Berry combined with &quot;the Berea-based Kentucky Environmental Foundation (KEF), along with several other non-profit organizations and rural electric co-op members&quot; to petition against and protest the construction of a coal-burning power plant in Clark County, Kentucky. On February 28, 2011, the Kentucky Public Service Commission approved the cancellation of this power plant.

On December 20, 2009, due to the University of Kentucky&#x27;s close association with coal interests in the state, Berry removed his papers from the university. He explained to the &quot;Lexington Herald-Leader&quot;, &quot;I don&#x27;t think the University of Kentucky can be so ostentatiously friendly to the coal industry … and still be a friend to me and the interests for which I have stood for the last 45 years. … If they love the coal industry that much, I have to cancel my friendship.&quot; In August 2012, the papers were donated to The Kentucky Historical Society in Frankfort.

On September 28, 2010, Berry participated in a rally in Louisville during an EPA hearing on how to manage coal ash. Berry said, &quot;The EPA knows that coal ash is poison. We ask it only to believe in its own findings on this issue, and do its duty.&quot;

Berry, with 14 other protesters, spent the weekend of February 12, 2011, locked in the Kentucky governor&#x27;s office to demand an end to mountaintop removal coal mining. He was part of the environmental group Kentuckians for the Commonwealth that began their sit-in on Friday and left at midday Monday to join about 1,000 others in a mass outdoor rally.

In 2011, the Berry Center was established at New Castle, Kentucky, &quot;for the purpose of bringing focus, knowledge and cohesiveness to the work of changing our ruinous industrial agriculture system into a system and culture that uses nature as the standard, accepts no permanent damage to the ecosphere, and takes into consideration human health in local communities.&quot;

In July 2020, Wendell Berry and his wife Tanya Amyx Berry sued the University of Kentucky to prevent the removal of a mural that has been criticized for being &quot;racially offensive.&quot; The mural was commissioned in the 1930s and was done by Ann Rice O&#x27;Hanlon, a relative of Tanya Amyx Berry.

In August 2022, at a public hearing of the Henry County, Kentucky planning commission, Wendell Berry spoke against re-zoning agricultural land to allow Angel&#x27;s Envy distillery to develop the property &quot;for bourbon-barrel storage and the development of an agritourism destination.&quot; Despite the testimony by Berry and others, the planning commission granted the re-zoning request.

==Ideas==
Berry&#x27;s nonfiction serves as an extended conversation about the life he values. According to him, the good life includes sustainable agriculture, appropriate technologies, healthy rural communities, connection to place, the pleasures of good food, animal husbandry, good work, local economics, the miracle of life, fidelity, frugality, reverence, and the interconnectedness of life. The threats Berry finds to this good simple life include: industrial farming and the industrialization of life, ignorance, hubris, greed, violence against others and against the natural world, the eroding topsoil in the United States, global economics, and environmental destruction. As a prominent defender of agrarian values, Berry&#x27;s appreciation for traditional farming techniques, such as those of the Amish, grew in the 1970s, due in part to exchanges with &quot;Draft Horse Journal&quot; publisher Maurice Telleen. Berry has long been friendly to and supportive of Wes Jackson, believing that Jackson&#x27;s agricultural research at The Land Institute lives out the promise of &quot;solving for pattern&quot; and using &quot;nature as model.&quot;

Jedediah Britton-Purdy has considered many of Berry&#x27;s major themes and concerns:Over the years, he has called himself an agrarian, a pacifist, and a Christian—albeit of an eccentric kind. He has written against all forms of violence and destruction—of land, communities, and human beings—and argued that the modern American way of life is a skein of violence. He is an anti-capitalist moralist and a writer of praise for what he admires: the quiet, mostly uncelebrated labor and affection that keep the world whole and might still redeem it. He is also an acerbic critic of what he dislikes, particularly modern individualism, and his emphasis on family and marriage and his ambivalence toward abortion mark him as an outsider to the left.The concept of &quot;Solving for pattern&quot;, coined by Berry in his essay of the same title, is the process of finding solutions that solve multiple problems, while minimizing the creation of new problems. The essay was originally published in the Rodale, Inc. periodical &quot;The New Farm&quot;. Though Berry&#x27;s use of the phrase was in direct reference to agriculture, it has since come to enjoy broader use throughout the design community.

Berry, who describes himself as &quot;a person who takes the Gospel seriously,&quot; has criticized Christian organizations for failing to challenge cultural complacency about environmental degradation, and has shown a willingness to criticize what he perceives as the arrogance of some Christians. He is an advocate of Christian pacifism, as shown in his book &quot;Blessed Are the Peacemakers: Christ&#x27;s Teachings About Love, Compassion and Forgiveness&quot; (2005).

Berry&#x27;s core ideas, and in particular his poem &quot;Sabbaths III, 1989 (Santa Clara Valley),&quot; guided the 2007 documentary feature film &quot;The Unforeseen&quot;, produced by Terrence Malick and Robert Redford. In the film Berry narrates his own poem. Director Laura Dunn went on to make the 2016 documentary feature &quot;Look &amp; See: A Portrait of Wendell Berry&quot;, again produced by Malick and Redford.

==Poetry==

Berry&#x27;s lyric poetry often appears as a contemporary eclogue, pastoral, or elegy; but he also composes dramatic and historical narratives (such as &quot;Bringer of Water&quot; and &quot;July, 1773&quot;, respectively) and occasional and discursive poems (&quot;Against the War in Vietnam&quot; and &quot;Some Further Words&quot;, respectively).

Berry&#x27;s first published poetry book consisted of a single poem, the elegiac &quot;November Twenty Six Nineteen Hundred Sixty Three&quot; (1964), initiated and illustrated by Ben Shahn, commemorating the death of John F. Kennedy. It begins,

&lt;poem&gt;We know
The winter earth
Upon the body
Of the young
   President,
   And the early dark
   Falling;&lt;/poem&gt;

and continues through ten more stanzas (each propelled by the anaphora of &quot;We know&quot;). The elegiac here and elsewhere, according to Triggs, enables Berry to characterize the connections &quot;that link past and future generations through their common working of the land.&quot;

The first full-length collection, &quot;The Broken Ground&quot; (1964), develops many of Berry&#x27;s fundamental concerns: &quot;the cycle of life and death, responsiveness to place, pastoral subject matter, and recurring images of the Kentucky River and the hill farms of north-central Kentucky.&quot;

According to Angyal, &quot;There is little modernist formalism or postmodernist experimentation in [Berry&#x27;s] verse.&quot; A commitment to the reality and primacy of the actual world stands behind these two rejections. In &quot;Notes: Unspecializing Poetry,&quot; Berry writes, &quot;Devotion to order that is not poetical prevents the specialization of poetry.&quot; He goes on to note, &quot;Nothing exists for its own sake, but for a harmony greater than itself which includes it. A work of art, which accepts this condition, and exists upon its terms, honors the Creation, and so becomes a part of it.&quot;

Lionel Basney placed Berry&#x27;s poetry within a tradition of didactic poetry that stretches back to Horace: &quot;To say that Berry&#x27;s poetry can be didactic, then, means that it envisions a specific wisdom, and also the traditional sense of art and culture that gives art the task of teaching this wisdom.&quot;

For Berry, poetry exists &quot;at the center of a complex reminding&quot; Both the poet and the reader are reminded of the poem&#x27;s crafted language, of the poem&#x27;s formal literary antecedents, of &quot;what is remembered or ought to be remembered,&quot; and of &quot;the formal integrity of other works, creatures and structures of the world.&quot;

=== The Sabbath Poems ===
From 1979 to the present Berry has been writing what he calls &quot;Sabbath poems.&quot; They were first collected in &quot;A Timbered Choir: The Sabbath Poems 1979–1997&quot;. This was followed by Sabbaths from 1998 to 2004 in &quot;Given: New Poems&quot;; and those from 2005 to 2008 are in &quot;Leavings&quot;. All Sabbath poems through 2012 are published in &quot;This Day: New and Collected Sabbath Poems 1979 – 2012&quot;. &quot;Sabbaths 2013&quot; has been published by Larkspur Press. &quot;A Small Porch&quot; contains nine Sabbath poems from 2014 and sixteen from 2015. One Sabbath poem, &quot;What Passes, What Remains&quot; (VIII from 2016), is published as the epilogue in &quot;The Art of Loading Brush&quot;. That poem, along with fourteen others, can also be found in &quot;Sabbaths 2016&quot;, published by Larkspur Press.

The poems are motivated by Berry&#x27;s longtime habit of walking out onto the land on Sunday mornings. As he puts it, &quot;I go free from the tasks and intentions of my workdays, and so my mind becomes hospitable to unintended thoughts: to what I am very willing to call inspiration.&quot; He writes in a poem from 1979,
&lt;poem&gt;The bell calls in the town 
Where forebears cleared the shaded land
And brought high daylight down
To shine on field and trodden road.
I hear, but understand
Contrarily, and walk into the woods.
I leave labor and load,
Take up a different story.
I keep an inventory
Of wonders and of uncommercial goods.&lt;/poem&gt;The Sabbath poems have been described as &quot;written from a particular place and on particular Sabbaths, and so should be read as part of a spiritual practice and as poems, in some sense, devoted to dwelling, to living thoughtfully in one place.&quot; Oehlschlaeger links Berry&#x27;s project to a key observation by Henry David Thoreau,

As Thoreau continues in &#x27;Life Without Principle,&#x27; he notes the constant busyness of Americans, so engaged in &#x27;infinite bustle&#x27; that &#x27;there is no sabbath.&#x27; And he notes later that &#x27;there is nothing, not even crime, more opposed to poetry, to philosophy, ay, to life itself, than this incessant business.&#x27; The logic is clear: destruction of the Sabbath is contrary to &#x27;life itself.&#x27; That, I suggest, is the context in which we should read the Sabbath poems that Berry has been writing for nearly the last thirty years.

==Fiction==

Berry&#x27;s fiction to date consists of eight novels and fifty-seven short stories—all of which are collected in &quot;That Distant Land&quot; (2004), &quot;A Place in Time&quot; (2012) and &quot;How It Went&quot; (2022)—and one verse drama which, when read as a whole, form a chronicle of the fictional small Kentucky town of Port William. Because of his long-term, ongoing exploration of the life of an imagined place, Berry has been compared to William Faulkner. Yet, although Port William is no stranger to murder, suicide, alcoholism, marital discord, and the full range of losses that touch human lives, it lacks the extremes of characterization and plot development that are found in much of Faulkner. Hence Berry is sometimes described as working in an idealized, pastoral, or nostalgic mode, a characterization of his work which he resists: &quot;If your work includes a criticism of history, which mine certainly does, you can&#x27;t be accused of wanting to go back to something, because you&#x27;re saying that what we were wasn&#x27;t good enough.&quot;

The effect of profound shifts in the agricultural practices of the United States and the disappearance of traditional agrarian life are two of the major concerns of the Port William fiction, though these themes are often only a background or subtext to the stories themselves. The Port William fiction attempts to portray, on a local scale, what &quot;a human economy … conducted with reverence&quot; looked like in the past—and what civic, domestic, and personal virtues might be elicited by such an economy, were it pursued today. Social as well as seasonal changes mark the passage of time. The Port William stories allow Berry to explore the human dimensions of the decline of the family farm and farm community under the influence of expanding post-World War II agribusiness. But these works rarely fall into simple didacticism, and are never merely tales of decline. Each is grounded in a realistic depiction of character and community. In &quot;A Place on Earth&quot; (1967), for example, farmer Mat Feltner comes to terms with the loss of his only son, Virgil. In the course of the novel, we see how not only Mat but the entire community wrestles with the acute costs of World War II.

Berry&#x27;s fiction also allows him to explore the literal and metaphorical implications of marriage as that which binds individuals, families, and communities to each other, and to Nature itself. Yet not all of Port William is happily or conventionally married. &quot;Old Jack&quot; Beechum struggles with significant incompatibilities with his wife, and with a brief yet fulfilling extramarital affair. The barber Jayber Crow lives with a forlorn, secret, and unrequited love for a woman he believes himself &quot;mentally&quot; married to, though she knows nothing about it. Burley Coulter never formalizes his bond with Kate Helen Branch, the mother of his son. Yet, each of these men finds himself firmly bound up in the community, the &quot;membership,&quot; of Port William.

Of his fictional project, Berry has written: &quot;I have made the imagined town of Port William, its neighborhood and membership, in an attempt to honor the actual place where I have lived. By means of the imagined place, over the last fifty years, I have learned to see my native landscape and neighborhood as a place unique in the world, a work of God, possessed of an inherent sanctity that mocks any human valuation that can be put upon it.&quot; Elsewhere, Berry has said, &quot;The only thing I try to accomplish in fiction is to show how people act when they love each other.&quot; The novels and stories can be read in any order.

In January 2018, the Library of America published a volume of Berry&#x27;s fiction—the first of a projected four volumes of his writing. &quot;Wendell Berry: Port William Novels &amp; Stories (The Civil War to World War II)&quot; contains four novels and twenty-three short stories in chronological order according to the stories&#x27; events. Berry is one of very few living writers currently featured in the Library of America catalog.

===&quot;Nathan Coulter&quot; (1960)===
In Berry&#x27;s first novel, young Nathan &quot;comes of age&quot; through dealing with the death of his mother, the depression of his father, Jarrat, the rugged companionship of his brother Tom, and the mischief of his uncle Burley. &quot;Kirkus Review&quot; concludes, &quot;A sensitive adolescent theme is handled rather poetically, but so uniform in tone that no drama is generated and no sense of time passing is felt.&quot; John Ditsky finds William Faulkner&#x27;s influence in &quot;Nathan Coulter&quot;, but notes, &quot;Not only does the work avoid the pitfalls encountered by Faulkner&#x27;s initial attempts to escape his postage stamp of native soil, but Nathan Coulter also seems a wise attempt to get that autobiographical first novel out of one&#x27;s system, and to do so [with] honesty.&quot;

===&quot;A Place on Earth&quot; (1967/1983)===
Set in the critical year of 1945, this novel focuses on farmer Mat Feltner&#x27;s struggle over the news that his son Virgil has been listed as missing in action while also telling multiple tales of the lives of other Port William residents, such as Burley Coulter, Jack Beechum, Ernest Finley, Ida and Gideon Crop. Reprinting by North Point Press in 1983 allowed Berry to radically revise the novel, removing almost a third of its original length. Jeffrey Bilbro believes that these substantial changes marked growth in Berry&#x27;s approach. &quot;In Berry&#x27;s revised edition, his technique caught up with his subject. He allows us, as readers, to participate in the ignorance of his characters, and in doing so, we may be able to understand more fully the painful difficulty of choosing fidelity to the natural order while living in the midst of mystery.&quot;

===&quot;The Memory of Old Jack&quot; (1974)===
This third novel of Port William begins with Jack Beechum as a very old man in 1952 and continues back into his youth and maturity to uncover his life and work as a dedicated farmer, conflicted husband, and living link to past generations. The story ranges from the Civil War to just past World War II. Josh Hurst comments on Berry&#x27;s ability to avoid certain narrative pitfalls, &quot;Jack&#x27;s story could be presented us either as heroic ballad or as cautionary [tale]—and there is much in his life to support both admiration and gentle tisk-tisking—but the gift of this book is how it allows a man&#x27;s memories to wash over us as though unshaped by narrative or conscious editorializing.&quot;

===&quot;Remembering&quot; (1988)===
In Berry&#x27;s fourth novel, an adult Andy Catlett wanders through San Francisco remembering, but feeling alienated from, his native Port William. He struggles to come to terms with himself, his marriage, his farm, and the distorted values of American society. Of Berry&#x27;s vision here, Charles Solomon writes, &quot;Wendell Berry contrasts modern American agribusiness—which he depicts as an artificial conglomeration of sterile flow charts, debts and mechanization—with the older ideal of farming as a nurturing way of life.&quot; But along these lines, Bruce Bawer finds a problem with the novel, &quot;Here, for the first time in a Port William novel, Berry seems more interested in communicating opinions than in portraying sympathetic characters in plausible situations; the opening episode, set at a conference on agricultural policy, paints the ideological conflict between Andy and his adversaries in broad, unsubtle strokes.&quot;

===&quot;A World Lost&quot; (1996)===
Young Andy Catlett&#x27;s uncle Andrew had been murdered back in 1944, and now an adult Andy is reconstructing the event and its aftermath. &quot;Looking back with a mixture of a young boy&#x27;s incomprehension and an older man&#x27;s nostalgia, Andy evokes the past not as a narrative but as a series of disembodied fragments in the flow of time.&quot; In this fifth novel of Port William, Berry considers the violence of men and its impact on the family and community that must come to terms with it. &quot;Berry shows us the psychic costs of misplaced family pride and social rigidity, and yet he also celebrates the benevolent blessing of familial love. This is simple, soul-satisfying storytelling, augmented by understated humor and quiet insight.&quot;

===&quot;Jayber Crow&quot; (2000)===
Port William&#x27;s barber recounts his life&#x27;s journey in Berry&#x27;s sixth novel. Jayber&#x27;s early life as an orphan near Port William is followed by studies towards a possible vocation to Church ministry. A questioning mind, however, sends him in other directions until he finds himself back in Port William with an ever-growing commitment to that place and its people. As &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; notes, &quot;Crow&#x27;s life, which begins as WWI is about to erupt, is emblematic of a century of upheaval, and Berry&#x27;s anecdotal and episodic tale sounds a challenge to contemporary notions of progress. It is to Berry&#x27;s credit that a novel so freighted with ideas and ideology manages to project such warmth and luminosity.&quot;

===&quot;Hannah Coulter&quot; (2004)===
Berry&#x27;s seventh novel presents a concise vision of Port William&#x27;s &quot;membership.&quot; The story encompasses Hannah&#x27;s life, including the Great Depression, World War II, the postwar industrialization of agriculture, the flight of youth to urban employment, and the consequent remoteness of grandchildren. The tale is told in the voice of an old woman twice widowed, who has experienced much loss yet has never been defeated. Somehow, lying at the center of her strength is the &quot;membership&quot;—the fact that people care for each other and, even in absence, hold each other in a kind of presence. All in all, &quot;Hannah Coulter&quot; embodies many of the themes of Berry&#x27;s Port William saga.

===&quot;Andy Catlett: Early Travels&quot; (2006)===
Andy Catlett, age nine, makes his first solo journey to visit with both sets of grandparents in Port William. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer notes, &quot;What the grown-up Andy recalls of that experience is transformed into &#x27;a sort of homage&#x27; to a now-vanished world. Title characters from Berry&#x27;s earlier Port William volumes — Jayber Crow, Old Jack, Hannah Coulter — appear here in affectionate cameos as the adult Andy, echoing Wordsworth, observes that &#x27;in my memory, all who were there ... seem now to be gathered into a love that is at once a boy&#x27;s and an aging man&#x27;s.&#x27;&quot;

<text>Smuggler&#x27;s Run is a video game developed by Angel Studios and published by Rockstar Games as a launch title for the PlayStation 2 on October 26, 2000. In the game, the player plays as a smuggler who has a number of different vehicles at his disposal including dune buggies, rally cars, and military vehicles. The vehicles are used to smuggle assorted cargo through three different large, open levels. The game, which was an early release for the Sony PlayStation 2, features career and 1- to 2-player arcade modes.

&quot;Smuggler&#x27;s Run&quot; became a part of the Sony Greatest Hits series of games that reached a particular sales milestone for the PlayStation 2.

==Gameplay==
Smuggler&#x27;s Mission:
New to a local smuggling gang, the player&#x27;s job is to smuggle cargo through three consecutive levels (forest, desert, and snow) with about ten missions per level. In nearly all missions they must evade the U.S. border patrol, the CIA, or rival smuggling gangs. This is essentially the career mode of the game. There are a total of 34 missions to complete here.

Turf War:
In this mode, players can play three different mini-games - two of which involve smuggling cargo while fighting against a rival gang. The final mini-game is a race through a popular spot through the level of their choice.

Joyriding:
This is a free roam mode where the player can explore the level of their choice without having to evade the border patrol. This is a good way to become familiar with the levels and find optimal routes through the level during Smuggler&#x27;s Mission.

==Reception==
The PlayStation 2 version received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;, while the Game Boy Advance version received &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. David Chen of &quot;NextGen&quot; said of the former console version, &quot;A truly next-generation launch title, it&#x27;s fast, fun, and free of constraints – just the way we like our cross-country crime sprees.&quot; In Japan, where the same console version was ported for release under the name and published by Syscom on December 28, 2000, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 28 out of 40.

Jake The Snake of &quot;GamePro&quot; said in one review that the PlayStation 2 version &quot;has so many variables that no two runs are alike, and you&#x27;ll enjoy replaying missions over and over. If you&#x27;re in the market for some highly addictive, heart-pounding action, socre a copy of &quot;Smuggler&#x27;s Run&quot;.&quot; In another &quot;GamePro&quot; review, Human Tornado said of the same console version, &quot;&quot;Smuggler&#x27;s Run&quot;″s go-anywhere experience frees you up to get a bit creative with your driving, and the high speeds combined with rugged off-road courses make for a wild ride.&quot; &quot;Edge&quot; gave the same console version a score of six out of ten, saying that it &quot;smacks of a game which has had a great deal of effort expended on its physics engine and raw playability, but very little on drawing up an overarching design.&quot;

==Sequel==

A sequel to the game was produced: &quot;Smuggler&#x27;s Run 2&quot;, which was released for the Sony PlayStation 2 on October 30, 2001. The sequel was later ported to the GameCube on August 7, 2002 and renamed &quot;Smuggler&#x27;s Run: Warzones&quot;.

<text>Smuggler&#x27;s Run 2: Hostile Territory or simply Smuggler&#x27;s Run 2 is a video game released for the PlayStation 2 in 2001. It is a sequel to the 2000 game &quot;Smuggler&#x27;s Run&quot;. Like the first game, the player is a smuggler trying to deliver illegal cargo to destinations within 3 large maps in the game using several different types of vehicles to make deliveries in a given amount of time. A GameCube version was released in 2002 titled Smuggler&#x27;s Run: Warzones.

The game was originally supposed to take place in Afghanistan but following the attacks on the World Trade Center and the subsequent invasion of Afghanistan, the developers changed the Afghanistan levels to the deserts of Georgia/Russia instead.

As in the first one, the police can drive the same cars but with much greater max speeds, the ability to go faster, slower and turn in midair to land on the player off jumps, extreme acceleration, and they can easily outnumber the player. Along with very inflexible time limits, this often leaves no room for mistakes.

==Gameplay==

Similar to the original game, the overall objective in most missions is to deliver illegal contraband from a pick-up to a drop-off spot in a given amount of time. The player would also have to avoid the local army and border patrol during these missions. Now, players also have to follow vehicles without being seen, destroy enemy vehicles, and evade police after all other objectives are finished. The player is given a number of vehicles to choose from.

==Plot==

The game takes place in three locations with the player working for a small smuggling company named Exotic Imports (EI or EXO for short). The story focuses on the activities and objectives given by The Colonel to EI. It starts in Russia, where the player finds out who they are working for and the basics of the game. Then, after being told to leave immediately from the area by Shodi (The main client) to Vietnam, Exotic Imports then learns of the CIA being involved after the Russians track 2 kg of Weapons Grade Plutonium. This takes you back to Russia, where Frank (Your Boss) asks the Colonel what is happening with the &quot;nukes&quot; and involvement from the CIA. Frank, only caring for money, agrees to continue smuggling nuclear devices. However, the rest of EI decide not to, and try to stop a missile which would cause WWIII. This reveals the Colonel&#x27;s intentions, and Frank escapes with all the passwords, showing his plans. EI stop Frank, and then it shows the player flying off in a helicopter with a cheque for $100,501,000.

==Reception==
Both &quot;Hostile Territory&quot; and &quot;Warzones&quot; received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Jim Preston of &quot;NextGen&quot; called the former &quot;A small improvement over the original that also smartly retains all the fun.&quot;

The D-Pad Destroyer of &quot;GamePro&quot; said of &quot;Hostile Territory&quot;, &quot;If you were a fan of the original, you&#x27;ll probably love &quot;Smuggler&#x27;s Run 2&quot;. It&#x27;s less a sequel and more like what the original should have been. If you couldn&#x27;t be bothered with &quot;Smuggler&#x27;s Run&quot;, this version doesn&#x27;t really add too much---just leave it in the dirt and go on to the next pick-up.&quot; Much later, Four-Eyed Dragon said, &quot;Despite its questionable ethical objectives, &quot;Warzones&quot; is simply a frantic driver that has you racing from one point to another while trying to avoid the local law.&quot;

The latter was nominated for the &quot;Best Driving Game on GameCube&quot; award at &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Best and Worst of 2002 Awards, which went to &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="680696" wikidata="Q5470754" url="?curid=680696" title="Fort Assinniboine">
<text>Fort Assinniboine was a United States Army fort located in present-day north central Montana (historically within the military Department of Dakota). It was built in 1879 and operated by the Army through 1911. The 10th Cavalry Buffalo Soldiers, made up of African-American soldiers, were among the units making up the garrison at the fort. Determining that this fort was no longer needed after the end of the Indian Wars, the US Army closed and abandoned it.

In 1916 Congress authorized a reservation for the Rocky Boy&#x27;s Band of Chippewa, who were landless. It became known as Rocky Boy&#x27;s Indian Reservation, named after the chief who had sought the reservation. A portion of the fort was ceded in 1916 for use as a reservation; the land extended in both Hill and Chouteau counties. This was intended for landless Chippewa who had been pushed west out of their traditional territory. In the event, landless Cree and Metis, refugees from Canada, also settled at the reservation.

==Context==
During the Great Sioux War of 1876, U.S. Army forces led by General Custer suffered a disastrous defeat at the Battle of Little Big Horn (known by the Sioux as the Battle of Greasy Grass) on June 25, 1876. The following year, the US Army defeated and captured the Nez Perce band of Chief Joseph in the Battle of Bear Paw.

At that time, General Phil Sheridan suggested that a fort be built on or near the Milk River to ward off possible attacks from the North by the Sioux led by Chief Sitting Bull, who had migrated to the Cypress Hills in Canada, or by the Nez Perce, some of whom were also in Canada. Lt. Col. J.R. Brooke recommended the site where the post was established. The fort is located in Hill County six miles southwest of Havre (the county seat). Today Highway 87 passes near it. It was named for the Siouan-speaking Assinniboine people. Neither the Sioux nor the Nez Perce in Canada ever attacked across the border.

==Active period==
The fort was located within a massive military reservation stretching south to the Missouri River, north to the Milk River and containing the Bear&#x27;s Paw Mountains. It encompassed 704,000 acres (1,100 sq. mi., 2850 km2) at its maximum extent in 1880. It later was reduced to encompass 220,000 acres (344 sq. mi., 890 km2). At its peak, it garrisoned more than 750 officers and enlisted men and their families. With 104 buildings, the fort was one of the largest ever built in the United States.

The 10th Cavalry Buffalo Soldiers, made up of African-American soldiers, were part of the Fort Assiniboine garrison during the Indian Wars. They were called into service on the front during the Spanish–American War. They supported the flank of Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;Rough Riders&quot; at the Battle of San Juan Hill in 1898 in Cuba. Eyewitnesses noted that the Rough Riders would not have prevailed without the Buffalo Soldiers.

From the late 19th century, the extensive lands of Fort Assiniboine served as a refuge for bands of landless Chippewa and Cree people, who camped within the military reservation. The fort was operated by the Army until 1911, when it was closed and abandoned, determined to no longer be necessary. The US believed that the Indians were peaceful or under control, mostly contained on reservations in the West, and on the decline. By 1912, a few hundred Native Americans were within the grounds.

==Notable people==
* John Pershing, career officer assigned for a time to Fort Assinboine. Pershing so impressed General-in-chief of the Army Maj. General Nelson A. Miles, who was on a hunting trip in the area, that Miles transferred the younger man to Washington, D.C. as an aide-de-camp. Pershing later served as a tactical officer at West Point. When the Spanish–American War broke out in 1898, he was reassigned, at his request, to the famed Buffalo Soldiers of Fort Assinniboine from the 10th Cavalry. They fought alongside Roosevelt in Cuba at the Battle of San Juan Hill. Pershing later achieved worldwide fame as the leader of the American Expeditionary Force in World War I, and continued to distinguish himself over the course of his career.
* Sgt. Horace Bivens, member of the 10th Cavalry Regiment and career soldier, he fought in Indian Wars in the Southwest. As part of the 10th, he served under John Pershing in Cuba during the Spanish American War. He was awarded a Silver Star for valor. In the early 20th century, he received the first Army Distinguished Pistol Shot badge because of his scores in marksmanship competitions.

==Closure==
By the early twentieth century, the Indian Wars were finished and the Army determined it no longer had a need for Fort Assiniboine. At the same time, Chippewa leader &quot;Asiniiwin&quot; (Rocky Boy) appealed to the Theodore Roosevelt administration for land and education for his band, who had been pushed out of their traditional territory further east.

Gradually numerous Chippewa and Cree people settled on the large military reservation; the Cree had come as refugees from Canada following the North-West Rebellion. The Chippewa had been pushed west from Wisconsin and Minnesota. Both groups traded with the Army and had no land of their own.

In 1916, Congress authorized establishment of a reservation for the Chippewa, who had been supported in their quest by prominent whites in Montana. The government ceded a portion of Fort Assinniboine to the Rocky Boy Indian Reservation, established for the Chippewa band led by Chief Ahsiniwiin (Rocky Boy, or Stone Child.) He had died several months before the reservation was authorized by Congress, and it was eventually named in his honor. It is the smallest reservation in the state in terms of land area, with a total land area of , which includes extensive off-reservation trust lands. (Some lands were added after the initial authorization.)

Most of the abandoned buildings at the fort were soon razed and hauled away by settlers for building materials. A handful of surviving structures have been adapted for use as both an agricultural research station associated with Montana State University - Bozeman, and as a historical preservation site. The site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

A portion of the Reservation, where the beaver creek ran through the Bears Paw Mountains, was first designated as a national park. The federal government later ceded it to the city of Havre, Montana for the purpose of a city recreation area. When they failed to use it, the Reservation transferred the land to Hill County, which created Beaver Creek Park. With 10,000 acres, it is the largest county park in the United States.

==Tourism==
It is possible to visit Fort Assinniboine. The Havre Chamber of Commerce and the Hill County Museum both furnish current visitor information. A tour guide is available during the summer season (June 1 through September 1), Monday through Sunday 9AM to 5PM. Tour guides are on-site. The site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="680700" wikidata="Q3285341" url="?curid=680700" title="The Man Show">
<text>The Man Show is an American sketch comedy television show on Comedy Central that aired from 1999 to 2004. It was created by its two original co-hosts, Adam Carolla and Jimmy Kimmel, and their executive producer Daniel Kellison. The pilot was originally paid for and pitched to ABC, who declined to pick up the show.

&quot;The Man Show&quot; simultaneously celebrated and lampooned the stereotypical loutish male perspective in a sexually charged, humorous light. The show consisted of a variety of pre-recorded comedy sketches and live in-studio events, usually requiring audience participation. &quot;The Man Show&quot; was a career breakthrough for Kimmel.

&quot;The Man Show&quot; is particularly well known for its buxom female models, the &quot;Juggy Dance Squad&quot;, who would dance in themed, revealing costumes at the opening of every show, in the aisles of the audience just before &quot;The Man Show&quot; went to commercial break, and during the end segment &quot;Girls on Trampolines&quot;. Several critics have accused the show of being sexist.

The first year of &quot;The Man Show&quot; featured beer-guzzling entertainer Bill &quot;the Fox&quot; Foster as the show&#x27;s emcee. Foster specialized in chugging two beers in record time (sometimes while suspended upside down) and singing lewd drinking songs. He would close every episode by leading the audience in the German drinking toast &quot;Zicke, Zacke, Zicke, Zacke, Hoi, Hoi, Hoi!&quot;, a tradition that the show continued after his death from prostate cancer in 2000.

==Episodes==

==Departure of Kimmel and Carolla==
In 2003, Kimmel and Carolla left &quot;The Man Show&quot;, with the hosting jobs passed down to comedians Joe Rogan and Doug Stanhope. With the hosting change came a re-composition of the show&#x27;s theme song. The new pair hosted the show for two more seasons before it ceased production in 2004, after its final episode aired on June 19.

==Post-series==
Kimmel went on to host his own late-night show for ABC, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, which he has hosted since 2003. Carolla stayed with Comedy Central to host &quot;Too Late with Adam Carolla&quot; in 2005 and then became part of CBS Radio&#x27;s Free FM experiment after Howard Stern joined Sirius Satellite Radio; his talk show, &quot;The Adam Carolla Show,&quot; ran until 2009. Carolla continues to do the show as a daily podcast and also co-hosted the Spike show &quot;Catch a Contractor&quot;. Carolla has appeared on Kimmel&#x27;s program several times (more so than any other guest) during its run.

Rogan continued to host &quot;Fear Factor&quot; for three more years after &quot;The Man Show&quot; was cancelled and eventually became color commentator for the Ultimate Fighting Championship, with which he has been associated since its early days. He also continues to tour as a standup comedian and began a podcast in 2012, eventually featuring influential in-depth interviews that frequently run three hours. Stanhope continues to perform philosophical standup comedy, hosts a podcast in Arizona, and remains one of Rogan&#x27;s most frequent podcast guests.

In 2012, for the season 4, episode 29 of &quot;Tosh.0&quot;, titled &quot;Virgin Trampoline Jumper&quot;, Daniel Tosh revisited &quot;The Man Show&quot; with hosts Joe Rogan and Doug Stanhope, in which they made the claim that the show still gets filmed. The hosts gave advice for a man who was 37 and still a virgin; they then set him up with a Juggy Girl.

In October 2017, several clips from the series began to resurface, including clips of Kimmel&#x27;s impersonations in blackface of Karl Malone. It wasn&#x27;t until June 2020 that Kimmel issued an apology for the Karl Malone sketches in the wake of the George Floyd protests. &quot;There is nothing more important to me than your respect, and I apologize to those who were genuinely hurt or offended by the makeup I wore or the words I spoke,&quot; Kimmel said in a statement, adding that he never realized that it could be viewed as more than &quot;an imitation of a human being.&quot;

<doc id="680703" wikidata="Q783489" url="?curid=680703" title="Later Liang (Five Dynasties)">
<text>Liang, known in historiography as the Later Liang () (1 June 907 – 19 November 923) or the Zhu Liang (), was an imperial dynasty of China and the first of the Five Dynasties during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. It was founded by Zhu Wen (Emperor Taizu), after he forced the last emperor of the Tang dynasty to abdicate in his favour (and then murdered him). The Later Liang would last until 923 when it was destroyed by the Later Tang dynasty.

==Formation==
Zhu Wen initially allied himself as Huang Chao&#x27;s lieutenant. However, he took Huang&#x27;s best troops and established his own power base as a warlord in Kaifeng. By 904, he had exerted control over both of the twin Tang dynasty capitals of Chang&#x27;an and Luoyang. Tang emperor Zhaozong was ordered murdered by Zhu in 904 and the last Tang emperor, Ai Di (Emperor Ai of Tang), was deposed three years later. Emperor Ai of Tang was murdered in 908, also ordered by Zhu.

Meanwhile, Zhu Wen declared himself emperor of the new Later Liang in Kaifeng in 907. The name Liang refers to the Henan region in which the heart of the regime rested.

==Extent of control==
The Later Liang controlled most of northern China, though much of Shaanxi (controlled by the Qi) as well as Hebei (controlled by the Yan state) and Shanxi (controlled by Shatuo Turks state Jin) remained largely outside Later Liang control.

==End of the dynasty==
The Later Liang maintained a tense relationship with the Shatuo Turks, due to the rivalry between Zhu Quanzong and Li Keyong, a relationship that began back in the time of the Tang dynasty. After Li Keyong&#x27;s death, his son, Li Cunxu, continued to expand his State of Jin. Li was able to destroy the Later Liang in 923 and found Later Tang.

==Conference of the Mandate of Heaven on the Later Liang==

Generally through Chinese history, it was historians of later kingdoms whose histories bestowed the Mandate of Heaven posthumously on preceding dynasties. This was typically done for the purpose of strengthening the present rulers&#x27; ties to the Mandate themselves. Song dynasty historian Xue Juzheng did exactly this in his work &quot;History of the Five Dynasties&quot;.

Several justifications were given for this, and successive Five Dynasties regimes, to be conferred the Mandate of Heaven. Among these was that these dynasties all controlled most of the traditional Chinese heartland. However, the Later Liang was an embarrassment in the brutality it employed, causing many to want to deny it this status, but doing so would break the chain through the other Five Dynasties, and thus to the Song dynasty, which itself was the successor to the last of the Five Dynasties.

<text>WTSP (channel 10) is a television station licensed to St. Petersburg, Florida, United States, serving the Tampa Bay area as an affiliate of CBS. The station is owned by Tegna Inc., and maintains studios on Gandy Boulevard on St. Petersburg&#x27;s northeast side, just off the Gandy Bridge; its transmitter is located in Riverview, Florida.

==History==
===Independent and ABC affiliation===
The station first signed on the air on July 18, 1965, as WLCY-TV, becoming the fourth commercial television outlet in the Tampa Bay region in a 12-year timeframe, and the fifth overall. The station debuted a week and a half after the conclusion of a decade-long court battle between five prospective owners seeking the Channel 10 license, including the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot;. It was owned by Rahall Communications, along with WLCY radio (1380 AM, now WWMI; and 94.9 FM, now WWRM). The station was affiliated with ABC, but spent its first month and a half of operation as an independent station, as previous ABC affiliate WSUN-TV (channel 38; frequency now occupied by WTTA) went to court to keep the affiliation. The city of St. Petersburg, owners of WSUN-TV, had been one of the applicants for the Channel 10 license, having jumped in out of fear of losing its ABC affiliation. WLCY ultimately won and formally switched to ABC in a special ceremony on September 1, 1965. As a condition for being placed on VHF channel 10 instead of a UHF placement, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) required the station to produce 20 hours of public service programming each week. When WLCY landed the ABC affiliation, it finally gave the Tampa Bay Area market all three commercial television affiliates on the VHF dial alongside WFLA-TV (channel 8) and WTVT (channel 13), respective affiliates of NBC and CBS.

Until 1981, the station was licensed to Largo, north of St. Petersburg, but its studios have always been based in St. Petersburg. The station&#x27;s first studio facilities were located at 2426 Central Avenue. Its current studios on Gandy Boulevard, originally known as the &quot;Rahall Color Communications Center&quot; were dedicated on October 15, 1968. In-studio broadcasts were fully in color by 1966, but field reports during the station&#x27;s newscasts remained in black and white until 1972.

The station aired several local children&#x27;s programs as &quot;Submarine 10&quot;, &quot;Romper Room&quot; with June Hurley, &quot;10 Ultimate&quot; and &quot;This Side Up,&quot; and local talk shows such as &quot;Russ Byrd&#x27;s Morning Show&quot;, &quot;The John Eastman Show&quot;, &quot;The Liz Richards Show&quot; and &quot;Murphy in the Morning&quot;. From 1966 to 1967, the station produced &quot;10 á Go Go,&quot; a teen dance show hosted by WLCY-AM disc jockey Roy Nilson. Another early local program was a morning exercise show, &quot;The Fran Carlton Show&quot;. The most popular program on channel 10 during that era was the syndicated &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot;. In the mid-1970s, the station aired &quot;Bowling for Dollars&quot; with host Jim Bradley.

In October 1971, WXLT (now WWSB, channel 40) signed on to provide ABC network programming to the Sarasota area as WLCY&#x27;s signal was mediocre to poor in most of Sarasota County. WLCY&#x27;s transmitter was located at 1754 Solar Drive in Holiday, an unincorporated community in the southwestern corner of Pasco County (where it would remain until 2011). Tampa Bay residents had to use a special VHF antenna that faced away from Riverview in order to view WLCY (this setup was called the &quot;Tampa Bay Special&quot;). Ratings for the station during the early to mid-1970s were dismal, however, compared to WTVT (channel 13) and WFLA-TV (channel 8) and, as a result, channel 10 nearly lost its ABC affiliation. Its transmitter location in Pasco County was the primary contributor to WLCY&#x27;s low viewership (all of other stations serving the Tampa Bay area operated their transmitters in Riverview, in Hillsborough County). It also operated at a lower power than the other Tampa Bay stations.

In 1977, WLCY-TV was purchased by Dallas, Texas-based Gulf United Broadcasting. New owner Alan Henry (of WINS New York fame), general manager Larry Clamage, and news director George &quot;Bud&quot; Faulder began to turn the station around, changing the call letters to WTSP-TV on September 12, 1978, and hiring several new on-air staff members who changed the face of the station. In June 1979, WTSP began using a logo known as the &quot;sunset 10&quot; (which was later duplicated by its sister station KTSP in Phoenix, Arizona) along with the &quot;Action News&quot; format.

WTSP is also a station of firsts: in October 1979, the station acquired &quot;Sky 10&quot;, Tampa Bay&#x27;s first television news helicopter which was the only one to broadcast live aerial coverage of the aftermath of the infamous Skyway Bridge disaster in May 1980. Another technological advance was Tampa Bay&#x27;s first satellite news truck called &quot;Star 10&quot; which was introduced in 1984, that beamed signals from distant locations to WTSP&#x27;s Gandy Boulevard studios. WTSP also acquired Tampa Bay&#x27;s first Doppler weather radar called &quot;StormSeeker&quot; in 1980, was one of the first television stations in the country to use a computer in weather forecasting called &quot;WeatherEye&quot; in 1979 and was the first station in the market to provide a seven-day forecast in 1992. The station pioneered the use of satellite technology among local television stations in the United States, deploying its own satellite dish in 1979.

In 1979, the station launched an aggressive marketing campaign, and in April of that year, the station built a taller transmission tower, improving the station&#x27;s broadcast signal. By 1982, WTSP had passed WFLA in the evening news ratings where it remained until the latter part of the decade. WTSP has won many prestigious awards, including the George Foster Peabody award in 1983. Taft Broadcasting (soon to be rebranded Taft Television and Radio) purchased the station along with four other Gulf properties in 1985. Then, in 1988 after a hostile takeover, Taft Television and Radio was forced to sell its independent stations and Fox affiliates to TVX Broadcast Group, while Taft&#x27;s remaining network affiliate properties, including WTSP, became part of the restructured Great American Broadcasting (which became known as Citicasters by 1995).

===CBS affiliation===

In June 1994, Scripps Howard Broadcasting arranged for several of its stations to affiliate with ABC (including WFTS-TV, channel 28, which was about to lose its Fox affiliation to then-CBS affiliate WTVT, channel 13, due to a corporate deal between Fox and WTVT&#x27;s then-owner New World Communications) in order to allow WEWS-TV (Cleveland) and WXYZ-TV (Detroit) to renew their affiliations with the network. WTSP later signed a deal to become the market&#x27;s new CBS affiliate, resulting in a three-way affiliation swap that occurred on December 12, 1994, with the &quot;ABC Sunday Night Movie&quot; premiere of &quot;Hook&quot; being the final ABC program to air on channel 10 on December 11 at 9 p.m. Eastern Time. Upon switching to CBS, WTSP went from third to second place in the local news ratings, although a later resurgent WTVT and competition from WFTS&#x27; upstart news department would result in the station battling for second with those stations for the remainder of the 1990s. WFLA was the market leader, until dipping to second after the 2009 premiere of the 10 p.m. &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;.

Citicasters (which held on to WTSP and WKRC-TV in Cincinnati, Ohio after it sold its other television stations to New World, whose station properties were later acquired by Fox Television Stations in 1997) merged with Jacor in September 1996. Three months later, in December 1996, the Gannett Company acquired WTSP in a swap deal, selling six of its radio stations to Jacor in return. In the spring of 1999, WTSP debuted a new Doppler weather radar system branded as &quot;Double Doppler&quot;. The station ceased using the radar located in Pasco County in 2013; the remaining radar is located at the station&#x27;s transmitter site in Riverview.

On October 9, 2008, WTSP rebranded from &quot;Tampa Bay&#x27;s 10&quot; to &quot;10 Connects&quot; (with the &quot;10 Connects Network&quot; being used alternatively). The station&#x27;s &quot;10 Connects&quot; logo was similar to the one in use since 2002 though without the wave design, along with a small notch in the oval portion of the logo for the &quot;Connects&quot; text (this logo was nicknamed &quot;Pacman&quot; for its resemblance to the video game character.). The station re-branded itself as &quot;10News&quot; in July 2010.
The station re-launched its investigative unit, &quot;10Investigates&quot;, in 2011 with the nucleus of investigative reporters Mike Deeson and Noah Pransky. The unit has won several national awards since then, including a national Edward R. Murrow Award for a story on soccer goal safety and national Columbia-duPont and George Polk awards for exposing red light camera injustices.

Around the first week of October 2012, Gannett entered a dispute against Dish Network regarding compensation fees and Dish&#x27;s AutoHop commercial-skip feature on its Hopper digital video recorders. Gannett ordered that Dish discontinue AutoHop on the account that it is affecting advertising revenues for WTSP. Gannett threatened to pull it from the satellite provider should the skirmish continue beyond October 7 and Dish and Gannett fail to reach an agreement. The two parties eventually reached an agreement after extending the deadline for a few hours.

On June 29, 2015, the Gannett Company split in two, with one side specializing in print media and the other side specializing in broadcast and digital media. WTSP was retained by the latter company, named Tegna. Its branding then evolved to &quot;10News WTSP&quot;. In May 2020, the station would be rebranded as &quot;10 Tampa Bay&quot;; at that time, the station rolled out a new logo designed by Atlanta-based design firm Matchstic, who had also created an identity for sister station WXIA-TV in 2019.

==Programming==
===Sports programming===
WTSP served as the official regional host station for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers&#x27; win in Super Bowl LV, which was held in the team&#x27;s home field, Raymond James Stadium (notably the first team to play and win an NFL title game in its own stadium in the Super Bowl era); WTSP previously served in this same capacity for Super Bowl XXXV in 2001 and Super Bowl XXV in 1991 (as a then-ABC affiliate). WTSP was also served as the official regional host station of the 1999 Final Four which was held at Tropicana Field.

===News operation===
WTSP presently broadcasts 30 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with five hours each weekday, two hours on Saturdays and three hours on Sundays). Channel 10&#x27;s on-air staff during its early years included Dick Crippen, who originally served as weathercaster and then sports anchor (and had also hosted a children&#x27;s program on the station, &quot;Space Station 10&quot;); Marshall Cleaver, Al Stockmeyer, Art Johnson, who served as news anchors; and Karol Kelly as a weather anchor. Cleaver was the original news anchor for much of the 1960s and early 1970s, when the station&#x27;s newscasts were called &quot;NewsNight&quot;. In 1975, former WFLA-TV anchor Arch Deal became the station&#x27;s news director and co-anchored &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; with Cleaver. Cleaver was removed in 1977, and Deal continued to anchor until channel 10&#x27;s newscasts were rebranded as &quot;Action NewsCenter&quot;, a format similar to the newscasts on WTHR in Indianapolis at the time, with former WTVT anchors Rod Challenger and Gary Rebstock along with Rick Moore. WLCY broadcast the first 5:30 p.m. newscast in the Tampa Bay market during the late 1970s up until September 15, 1980, when the newscast was moved to 6 p.m. Beginning in 1979, Don Harrison, Wally Kinnan and Dick Crippen became the new anchors of channel 10&#x27;s evening newscasts. Ratings surged, making the Tampa Bay market more competitive.

In late 1982, news anchor Don Harrison left WTSP to become an anchor for CNN2 (now HLN). John Wilson and Liz Ayers replaced Harrison as anchor. On January 9, 1983, Sheryl Browne joined Wilson at the anchor desk on &quot;Action News&quot;, rounding out the station&#x27;s main anchor team. Longtime WTSP chief meteorologist Dick Fletcher joined the station in March 1980 and became famous for his forecasting during Hurricane Elena in 1985. Award-winning reporter Mike Deeson, legendary sports anchor Ken Broo and feature reporter Bill Campbell, famous for his &quot;Campbell&#x27;s Corner&quot; segments, bolstered the station in the 1980s. WTSP became the second Tampa Bay area station to launch an hour-long 6 p.m. newscast in 1986 (rival WTVT had been the first to do so many years earlier and WTSP attempted it in an effort to pass WTVT to the top of the local news ratings; however, the effort only lasted until 1987).

However, the station&#x27;s reputation suffered a serious blow when in the fall of 1988, new assistant news director Michael Shapiro, previously employed at WTVT, began surreptitiously spying on and deleting files from WTVT&#x27;s newsroom computer system via an unchanged temporary password. Additionally, Shapiro apparently broke into WTVT news director Jim West&#x27;s office and copied sensitive information from West&#x27;s computer. By January 1989, the case was being covered by the national news media. Charges were brought against Shapiro and WTSP&#x27;s news director Terry Cole, but ultimately both sides agreed to settle; Shapiro and Cole were both fired that April.

Cole was replaced by Mel Martin, who set out to restore the station&#x27;s credibility and improve morale; as part of this effort, on June 4, 1989, the newscasts were rebranded as &quot;NewsCenter 10&quot;, concurrent with the debut of a 5 p.m. newscast. Longtime anchor John Wilson left the station in September 1993 for WTVT (staying there until his retirement in 2014), and Pat Minarcin replaced him as lead anchor shortly afterwards alongside Sue Zelenko; this team stayed in place through the station&#x27;s switch to CBS.

In January 1998, Reginald Roundtree replaced Pat Minarcin as the lead male anchor of WTSP&#x27;s newscasts (by then, known as &quot;10 News&quot;); Minarcin later sued the station for age discrimination. On October 14, 2002, the station launched a new news format and image, with a new red color scheme (teased in promos stating &quot;You&#x27;ll be seeing red&quot;) and slogan (&quot;Enjoy it, we do.&quot;) used in promos, as well as a new 4 p.m. lifestyle show, &quot;Life Around the Bay&quot;; a new, state-of-the-art digital newsroom was also constructed for WTSP&#x27;s news staff. In 2005, the station debuted &quot;Vortex&quot;, a powerful new forecasting tool. On January 14, 2008, WTSP became the third station in the Tampa Bay market (behind WFTS-TV and WFLA-TV) to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition; with the conversion came a brand-new news set (designed by Jack Morton Design/PDG), graphics and music package. In September 2008, Chris Suchan replaced morning meteorologist Anna Allen, who had been at the station since 2004. Soon after, Tammie Souza was named chief meteorologist, taking longtime chief meteorologist Dick Fletcher&#x27;s place after he died from a stroke in February. On October 9, 2008, WTSP began using Gannett&#x27;s then-new standardized news music (composed by Rampage Music New York) and graphics package (designed by Gannett Graphics Group).

On April 1, 2009, WTSP fired longtime anchor Marty Matthews (who had been anchor of the station&#x27;s 4 p.m. newscast and a feature reporter for the &quot;Wednesday&#x27;s Child&quot; child adoption segment prior to her firing) due to budget cuts imposed by Gannett; Matthews had controversially been informed of her termination in a manila envelope sent to her by the station. The previous year, WTSP fired weekend anchor Jennifer Howe, weekend meteorologist Randy Rauch and Anna Allen. The 4 p.m. newscast was later canceled, and Matthews&#x27; former co-anchor Dave Wirth became the station&#x27;s lead sports anchor (Wirth had been a sports anchor for the station for 20 years, until moving to the news desk in 2004).

WTSP&#x27;s news ratings at 11 p.m. increased during the May 2009 sweeps period, edging out WFLA for first place. In June 2009, the station entered into a Local News Service agreement with Fox-owned WTVT and Scripps-owned WFTS-TV to share news video for use in each of the stations&#x27; own reports. As part of this new arrangement, WTSP stopped using its helicopter &quot;Sky 10&quot; on August 1, 2009; it, WTVT and WFTS began sharing a single news helicopter (&quot;Action Air One&quot;) to cover news events.

On July 26, 2010, the station&#x27;s newscasts reverted to the &quot;10 News&quot; branding, along with the resurrection of the station&#x27;s previous logo. The about-face was the result of WTSP switching to a more-traditional news formula, as well as the fact that the &quot;10 Connects&quot; moniker was not understood by many viewers. In August 2010, veteran former WFLA-TV anchor Bill Ratliff joined the station as a political analyst. In February 2011, radio talk show host Bubba the Love Sponge began a nightly editorial segment, &quot;Bring it on Bubba&quot;, on WTSP&#x27;s 11 p.m. newscast. On September 12, 2011, WTSP debuted a half-hour news program at 9 a.m. as an extension of the station&#x27;s existing weekday morning newscast, using the anchors and meteorologist of the earlier 5–7 a.m. news block.

In December 2012, WTSP became one of the first Gannett stations to implement a new standard graphics package designed by The Mill. The new graphics use a horizontal design influenced by website and mobile app designs, and utilize color-coded tabs to represent certain categories of topics—matching those used by then-sister publication &quot;USA Today&quot;.

On April 18, 2017, WTSP underwent a significant re-launch of its news department, renaming its morning and late-night broadcasts &quot;10 News Brightside&quot; and &quot;10 News Nightside&quot; respectively. The new formats place a larger focus upon stories trending on social media; at the same time, new anchors were introduced for the morning news, including Jackie Fernandez (who previously worked at ABC affiliate WEWS-TV in Cleveland), Rob Finnerty, and meteorologist Grant Gilmore (who came over from sister station WFMY in Greensboro, North Carolina, also a CBS affiliate). Now, &quot;Brightside&quot; is anchored by Caitlin Lockerbie, who started in the summer of 2019 coming from WATN-TV in Memphis and Frank Wiley who came in from WEWS in early 2021 after Finnerty left to join Newsmax.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:


===Translator===
* 4 Hernando

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WTSP shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 10, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 24 to VHF channel 10. The station&#x27;s previous digital allocation on channel 24 is now occupied by the digital signal of WWSB in Sarasota.

On February 6, 2010, WTSP doubled its transmitter&#x27;s effective radiated power from 35 kW to 78 kW to help with reception issues that plagued the station&#x27;s VHF digital signal. At the time, the station&#x27;s transmitter tower was still segregated farther north in Holiday due to bygone analog spacing requirements. However, even after the increase in power the reception problems persisted for area viewers which aim their antennas toward the majority of transmitters for the Tampa Bay market located southeast in Riverview.

On January 7, 2011, WTSP filed an application with the FCC to move its transmitter from Holiday to the Riverview antenna farm; however, while WTSP remains short-spaced with WPLG, it will give more signal spacing for its Jacksonville sister station WJXX; both WPLG and WJXX also operate their post-conversion digital signals on channel 10. The FCC granted WTSP a construction permit on January 26. The move was completed on October 1, 2011.

Northern portions of the viewing area lost the station&#x27;s signal after the move to Riverview; in response to this, the station received a construction permit for a digital fill-in translator on channel 4 that is licensed to St. Petersburg, but will primarily serve northern Citrus County, from a transmitter located near Hernando.

On February 28, 2014, WTSP&#x27;s second digital subchannel, long the home of an automated &quot;Weather Now&quot; subchannel originated locally on the station&#x27;s weather computer system, was replaced with Antenna TV. On January 20, 2015, WTSP added an additional digital subchannel, Justice Network (now True Crime Network).

On December 1, 2020, WTSP joined four other Tampa Bay television stations to collaborate on the launch of NextGen TV ATSC 3.0 in the Tampa–St. Petersburg market. The stations joined other early adopters across the country in rolling out the new third-generation digital TV broadcast technology designed to revolutionize how viewers interact with their home screens.

<doc id="680719" wikidata="Q5444772" url="?curid=680719" title="Fernando L. Ribas-Dominicci">
<text>Fernando Luis Ribas-Dominicci (June 24, 1952 – April 15, 1986), was a captain and F-111F pilot in the United States Air Force. He was killed in action during the U.S. air raid on Libya, Operation El Dorado Canyon, on April 15, 1986. Ribas Dominicci was awarded the Purple Heart and posthumously promoted to the rank of major. 

==Early years==
Ribas-Dominicci was born in the town of Utuado, in the mountains of Puerto Rico, where he received his primary and secondary education. As a child, he had always dreamed of becoming a pilot and after he graduated from high school, he entered the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez where he earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in civil engineering. As a student in the university, he was a member of the campus&#x27; Air Force ROTC program and upon graduation was commissioned a second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force.

==Military career==
Ribas-Dominicci next completed Undergraduate Pilot Training and was awarded his pilot wings at Laughlin Air Force Base, later he was assigned to Cannon Air Force Base, in New Mexico, where he received advanced training as a General Dynamics F-111 combat pilot. He served as an F-111 Aardvark pilot with the 522nd Fighter Squadron and then the 523d Fighter Squadron of the 27th Fighter Wing at Cannon AFB. By 1983, Ribas-Dominicci was a captain and the recipient of the Air Force Commendation Medal. In 1985, he completed his master&#x27;s degree in aeronautical science at the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida, United States.

===Operation El Dorado Canyon===

On April 15, 1986, in response to acts of terrorism sponsored by Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi, the United States attacked key terrorist training facilities in Tripoli, Libya, using 18 USAF F-111F fighter-bombers and 5 EF-111A radar jamming aircraft from bases in England. The attack was code-named Operation El Dorado Canyon. This was part of a joint strike mission in coordination with US Navy aircraft which struck targets in Behghazi, Libya, at the same time. Major Ribas-Dominicci was one of the pilots who participated in the air raid as member of the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing. His F-111F was shot down in action over the disputed Gulf of Sidra off the Libyan coast. Ribas-Dominicci and his weapon systems officer, Captain Paul F. Lorence, were the only U.S. casualties of the mission.

==Aftermath==
On December 25, 1988, after years of denying that they had the bodies of the two crew members, Gaddafi offered to release the body of Lorence to his family through Pope John Paul II. The body recovered and thought to be that of Lorence was actually that of then-Captain Fernando L. Ribas-Domminici, which was identified by dental records and returned in 1989.

The Libyan government has denied that it holds Lorence&#x27;s remains and the U.S government does not believe that they are hiding anything. Major Fernando Luis Ribas-Dominicci&#x27;s remains are buried in his hometown of Utuado.

==Honors and legacy==

Both men&#x27;s names are engraved in the F-111 &quot;Vark&quot; Memorial Park located in Clovis, New Mexico. Ribas-Dominicci was awarded the Purple Heart and posthumously promoted to the rank of major, effective April 15, 1986.

To honor his memory, the Government of Puerto Rico renamed the Isla Grande Airport in San Juan to Fernando Ribas Dominicci Airport. The City of Utuado honored the pilot by naming a main avenue as Fernando Ribas-Dominicci Avenue. A monument in Ribas-Dominicci&#x27;s honor, simulating an F-111, has been placed at the entrance of Utuado. Ribas-Dominicci&#x27;s name is engraved in &quot;El Monumento de la Recordación&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Monument of Remembrance&quot;) dedicated to Puerto Rico&#x27;s fallen soldiers and situated in front of the Capitol Building in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
==Awards and decorations==
Among Major Ribas-Dominicci&#x27;s military decorations were the following:

<text>The is an executive car (E-segment in Europe) manufactured and marketed by Lexus across four generations — launched in 1991 as the Toyota Aristo in Japan and as the Lexus GS for markets outside the Japanese market beginning in February 1993. It continued with the Toyota Aristo name for the Japanese market until January 2005.

Lexus marketed the GS as a performance sedan competing in the mid-luxury class, between its compact executive IS and large/flagship LS. The GS shared its chassis with one of Toyota&#x27;s longest-running nameplates, the Toyota Crown premium sedans until 2011.

The GS featured six-cylinder engines and rear-wheel drive, with V8 engines offered for all generations. All-wheel drive and hybrid versions debuted in 2005. Previously, all-wheel drive versions were already made available in the Japanese-market S140 series Aristo. The first two generations had a Japanese market equivalent, the Toyota Aristo (&quot;&quot; is Greek for &quot;the best&quot;), which was sold from 1991 until the Lexus marque&#x27;s Japanese debut in 2005. Though largely identical in exterior and interior design, the GS and the Aristo differed in their engine and transmission combinations as well as equipment packages. The GS name stands for Grand Sedan. However, some Lexus importers use the backronymic name, Grand Sport.

The first generation Lexus GS began sales in the United States, Europe and selected Asian markets in 1993. It was originally introduced with an inline-six engine and exterior bodywork designed by Italdesign Giugiaro. The second generation model premiered in 1997, using a new platform, in-house styling, and adding a V8 version for the first time outside Japan. The third generation GS, which premiered globally for the 2006 model year, was produced in V6, V8, and hybrid versions, the latter known as the GS 450h. The third generation models were the first GS sedans to be badged as such in the Japanese market.

The fourth generation Lexus GS premiered in August 2011 at the Pebble Beach Concours d&#x27;Elegance, where models introduced included the V6-powered GS 350, hybrid GS 450h, and performance-tuned F Sport variants. A lower-displacement V6 model, the GS 250, premiered at the Auto Guangzhou Exhibition in November 2011, targeted at Asian and European markets. In some markets such as North America and Asia, the GS shares the mid-size sedan category in the Lexus lineup with the front-wheel drive ES, serving as its rear-wheel-drive counterpart.

The GS was replaced in Europe by the Lexus ES from December 2018. The seventh generation ES is the first to be sold in Europe, replacing the GS in spite of being a front-wheel drive car. It went on sale from September 2018 in Russia, Turkey and other CIS markets and from December 2018 in Western and Central Europe. Production ended in August 2020.

== First generation (S140; 1991)==
Italdesign Giugiaro began the first design drawings of the GS 300 in 1988. The design firm aimed to produce a deluxe sedan which did without the numerous exterior features and detailing found on existing Japanese premium sedans, in favor of a more simplified, European-style appearance. The vehicle&#x27;s exterior styling blended elements of the then-current Lexus LS flagship and SC performance coupe in a rounded, aerodynamic wedge-like shape which featured a high rear decklid and longer and wider proportions than rival vehicles. The exterior produced a . Color schemes included single-tone bumper and body finishes, along with dual-tone schemes. Similarities with an Italdesign concept car which debuted in 1990, the Jaguar Kensington, led some observers to suggest that the GS 300 was derived from its design, though Italdesign said the GS 300 was developed earlier. Equipped with an independent, double-wishbone suspension setup at both front and rear ends, Italdesign&#x27;s sedan design first appeared in Toyota Aristo form in Japan in October 1991.

Manufactured at Toyota&#x27;s Tahara assembly plant in Japan, production of the Aristo involved more automation than previous vehicles built at the Tahara factory; robots performed 4,200 welds on each body, while only eight spot welds were performed by hand.

Toyota of Japan offered two straight-six engine options for the Japanese market Aristo—the 3.0Q and 3.0V. The 3.0Q (JZS147) featured the &quot;2JZ-GE&quot; engine which produced , while the Aristo 3.0V (JZS147) was equipped with a 24-valve twin-turbo &quot;2JZ-GTE&quot; engine which produced . The Aristo was available at &quot;Toyota Auto Store&quot; as the top-level luxury sedan, positioned above the Chaser and &quot;Toyota Vista Store&quot; above the Cresta. In 1992, a third model, the V8-powered 4.0Zi-Four (UZS143), joined the Aristo lineup. It came installed with iFour all-wheel drive and a &quot;1UZ-FE&quot; engine.

Production of the export Lexus GS 300 (JZS147) began on 22 February 1993. For Lexus, The GS was placed above the front-wheel drive ES luxury sedan with its superior drivetrain setup, power and available amenities. Lexus only offered the GS with the 3.0-liter &quot;2JZ-GE&quot; straight-six, producing and of torque.

For the interior, the GS 300 featured walnut wood trim on the center console, leather seating, an automatic tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, and the option of a Nakamichi premium stereo system. Driver and front passenger airbags were standard. A moonroof, remote 12-CD auto changer, and traction control (TRAC – left hand drive vehicles only) were options.

The GS was intended to take the price position of the original LS 400 flagship, which had moved upmarket since its 1989 launch. By the time of the GS 300&#x27;s debut, the initial base price of the LS in the United States had climbed to , while the GS 300 at debut carried base price of . However, sales of the GS 300 were modest, with 1993 seeing the greatest sales at 19,164 sold that year. Sales dropped in later years as the Japanese yen rose in value against the dollar and made the vehicle more expensive than its rivals. Additionally, more powerful V8 sport sedans provided strong competition. By 1997, the price of the GS 300 had risen to . Production of the first generation GS sedan ended in July 1997.

== Second generation (S160; 1997)==
===1997–2000===
In 1993, after sales commenced for the first generation S140 series, development began on the successor under the internally known codenamed &quot;S160&quot;. The design process began under chief engineer Yasushi Nakagawa in May 1994 and by November 1995 after 18 months of design work, the final production design by Akihiro Nagaya was approved by the executive board. In January 1997, Lexus debuted the &quot;High Performance Sedan&quot; (HPS) concept at the Detroit Auto Show, previewing the design direction for the redesigned GS.

In August 1997, the second generation Toyota Aristo was launched in Japan, codenamed JZS160 (S300 version) for models with &quot;2JZ-GE&quot; engines and JZS161 (V300 version) for those with &quot;2JZ-GTE&quot; twin-turbocharged engines, remaining exclusive to the former &quot;Auto Store&quot; network that was combined with &quot;Vista Store&quot; and renamed &quot;Toyota Netz Store&quot; Japanese dealerships. VVT-i was now standard, resulting in an increase of torque. The twin-turbocharged version was available with electronic four-wheel steering, VSC electronic stability control and an automatic transmission with a tiptronic manual sequential mode controlled by buttons on the steering wheel. 

The second generation sedans used a new front-engine, rear-wheel drive midsize platform, also featured in the Japanese-market Toyota Crown. The new model&#x27;s styling was produced in-house, and featured quadruple headlights (the interior two of which were elliptical) in a fashion similar to the Lexus SC coupe. It had a . Inside, electroluminescent &quot;Optitron&quot; gauges were offered for the first time, along with an upgraded stereo system for V300 versions. For export markets, the second generation GS began production in the JZS161 body style on 4 August 1997 and was officially launched in October 1997.

Lexus offered the GS 300 once again and featured a slightly revised version of the previous generation&#x27;s 3.0-liter straight-six now producing and of torque. Answering customer requests for more power, the American market GS 400 (UZS160) was equipped with the 4.0-liter &quot;1UZ-FE&quot; V8 that produced and of torque. Both models featured a five-speed automatic transmission with the GS 400 receiving steering wheel shift buttons. As with the S140 series, no turbocharged variants were offered outside Japan. The 5.7 second time of the GS 400 prompted Lexus marketing to claim that the GS was the world&#x27;s fastest production sedan at its introduction in 1997. 

Lexus promoted the arrival of the second generation GS sedan with the tagline, &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot;. Compared to its predecessor, the second generation GS sedan was a much bigger success, with sales reaching 30,622 vehicles in its first year, increasing in the second, and stabilizing at 28,079 vehicles by 2000. Lexus would keep the second generation vehicle in its lineup for eight years, a longer duration than the prior generation. The U.S. base price for the GS 300 and GS 430 averaged approximately and respectively.

The GS was &quot;Motor Trend&quot;″s Import Car of the Year for 1998. It also made &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ten Best list for 1998 through 2000. In IIHS frontal crash testing the 1999 and newer GS was given a &quot;Good&quot; overall score.

===2000–2005===

A facelift in 2000, for the 2001 model year was the only major design change of the second generation GS. There was a slightly revised grille, revised tail lights, and subtly tinted headlamps on the front end. Xenon headlamps became standard equipment with the V8 engine and optional on six-cylinder cars. More interior wood trim was added, and steering wheel shift buttons were added to the GS 300. The V8 engine also received a 0.3-liter increase in displacement, so the model designation changed to GS 430 (Toyota type code UZS161). Peak power was unchanged, but torque increased to . The GS 430 took 5.7 seconds to go from .

The Aristo was the last production car that saw the Twin Turbo 2JZ-GTE motor, continuing 3 additional years after the Toyota Supra, the only other vehicle featuring the 2JZ-GTE, was discontinued in 2002.

For the 2002 model year, Lexus offered a limited production GS 300 &quot;SportDesign&quot; package for North America; this performance/trim package offered the GS 300 the same firmly-tuned suspension and &quot;L-tuned&quot; steering ECU module that were both standard equipment on the GS 430, along with a rear lip spoiler and polished alloy wheels. Other features include special badging, titanium-like HID headlamps, and a chrome grille. The SportDesign package interior-wise added perforated leather upholstery, uniquely branded door sills along with brushed aluminum and dark stained walnut trim. A version of the SportDesign that included Navigation with a Mark Levinson sound system was also offered. The SportDesign trim package was offered from the 2002 through 2003 model years.

== Third generation (S190; 2005)==

===2005–2007===
In 1999, development commenced on a successor to the S160 under chief engineer, Shigetoshi Miyoshi. Styling for both the exterior and interior was done under lead designer Yasuhide Hosoda between 2000 and 2002, during which L-finesse came to fruition in 2001. By 2002, a design was finalized, to be introduced the following year. In October 2003, Lexus debuted the LF-S (Lexus Future Sedan), a concept car which previewed the design of the upcoming GS. The design patent was filed by Toyota on 22 December 2003 in domestic Japanese patent offices, preceding an imminent public unveiling. The third generation GS first appeared as a pre-production vehicle at the 2004 North American International Auto Show on 5 January, riding on a then new architecture N platform, with the production version being shown at the same show in January 2005.

Production of the third generation began on 24 January 2005, without release of an equivalent Toyota Aristo, as Toyota had introduced the Lexus channel to Japan and sought to align all world markets using Lexus as their luxury brand worldwide. The third generation GS was the introductory Lexus model for the marque&#x27;s new L-finesse design philosophy, indicating the future direction of the Lexus lineup; it featured a fastback profile, retained quad headlights, LED tailamps, and one-piece bumpers. This generation GS had a , and used a newly designed midsize platform later shared with the second generation IS.

In September 2005, the GS 350 (GRS191) and GS 430 (UZS190) went on sale in Japan; the GS 350 using a 3.5-liter &quot;2GR-FSE&quot; engine with &quot;D4-S&quot; direct injection, while the GS 430 used the same 4.3-liter &quot;3UZ-FE&quot; V8 engine used in the previous model. Sales in the US began in March 2006, with the initial lineup including the GS 300 (GRS190), featuring a ULEV certified 3.0-liter &quot;3GR-FSE&quot; V6 engine, and the GS 430 featuring the 4.3-liter V8. All GS models at launch featured a new six-speed automatic sequential shift gearbox. An all-wheel drive system was made available in the GS 300.

Unveiled at the 2005 New York International Auto Show, the hybrid GS 450h (GWS191) joined the GS line in 2006 for the 2007 model year. GS Hybrid production started in February 2006. It was the first mass-production rear-wheel drive luxury hybrid car, featuring the naturally aspirated 3.5-liter &quot;2GR-FSE&quot; V6 engine mated to two electric motors and a planetary type continuously variable transmission (CVT). This powertrain made use of the Lexus Hybrid Drive system of integrating electric and gasoline engine motors, giving the GS 450h a Super Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle (SULEV) emissions rating, and total output of , allowing the GS to accelerate in 5.2 seconds, according to manufacturer data.

New to the GS line was an electric power steering (EPS) system, and both the V8 and hybrid models featured a variable gear ratio steering (VGRS) system and Electronically Controlled Brake (ECB) a type of brake-by-wire system. V8 and hybrid models also featured an adaptive suspension system that individually altered suspension damper firmness. Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM) was standard on the GS 430, 460, and 450h models and coupled to VGRS, with which it could alter steering gear ratios.

Standard safety features on the GS ranged from multiple airbags, including knee airbags and front row side torso airbags, to adaptive headlights, anti-lock braking, electronic brakeforce distribution, brake assist and electronic stability control. The radar-based pre-collision system with an autonomous cruise control system was optional. The GS 450h was among the first vehicles to receive the infrared Driver Monitoring System for driver attentiveness. For the 2007 model year, the GS 350 replaced the GS 300 in the US and several other export markets.

The GS interior was available with leather bird&#x27;s-eye maple or walnut trim. Major standard features ranged from a 10-way driver and front passenger power and heated seats with three-position Lexus Memory System, SmartAccess keyless system with push-button start, a driver-side hidden drop-down panel for infrequently used controls, standard touchscreen display, and LED lighting in the cabin. Unique to the Lexus GS series was a three-pod instrument cluster with machined aluminum facings and an electrochromic feature. Optional features ranged from a power moonroof to a discrete 5.1 surround sound 14-speaker 330-watt Mark Levinson premium sound system, XM-satellite radio and DVD-based navigation with backup camera and Bluetooth technology. Competitors to the Lexus GS included the BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Volvo S80, Audi A6, Jaguar XF, Infiniti M, and Acura RL.

===2007–2011===
The GS 460 (URS191) replaced the GS 430 in 2007 for the 2008 model year, featuring a new 4.6-liter 1UR-FE (Middle East) or a &quot;1UR-FSE&quot; V8 engine with eight-speed automatic transmission generating and of torque. Lexus reported a time of 5.4 seconds. Along with the hybrid GS 450h and previous GS 430 models, the V8-powered GS 460 offered the Active Stabilizer Suspension System for improved handling. The GS 450h retains its position as the most expensive in the GS lineup, and has faster acceleration than the GS 460, though the GS 460 is lighter and has a higher top speed. In 2010, the GS was outsold nearly two to one by the flagship LS.

Along with the introduction of the GS 460, the GS lineup received a mid-cycle styling refresh, including a revised front bumper, headlights and grille, turn signals added to the side mirrors, and new wheel options and exterior colors. The interior received a redesigned steering wheel, revised instrument cluster gauges, and different trim pieces.

== Fourth generation (L10; 2011)==

===2011–2015===
In early 2007, development began on the L10 series GS under Yoshihiko Kanamori, with the design process finalizing under new president and CEO Akio Toyoda&#x27;s direction in 2009. Design patents were filed in Japan on 6 October 2010 for the production model and a conceptual variant on 29 March 2011. In April 2011, Lexus showed the LF-Gh concept (Lexus Future Grand-Touring Hybrid) at that year&#x27;s New York International Auto Show, previewing the stylistic direction of future Lexus models. The LF-Gh featured a large, spindle-shaped front grille, and press information further indicated that it had a new interior design which included an analog clock. The LF-Gh concept vehicle was taken by automotive journalists as an indication of what the fourth generation Lexus GS would look like.

The fourth generation GS had its world premiere at the Pebble Beach Concours d&#x27;Elegance in California in August 2011. The vehicle was shown to have a more subtle version of the LF-Gh&#x27;s spindle grille, while overall exterior dimensions are almost identical to the previous generation. L-shaped LED front daytime running lamps and rear LED tube lamps are a new design feature. The fourth generation GS was the centerpiece of Toyota chairman Akio Toyoda&#x27;s initiative to restore passion to the Lexus brand and better compete with German luxury automakers that had been gaining market share in the United States. It was reported that Toyoda initially opposed the styling choices made for the new model, but later thanked the design team that persuaded him to greenlight the project. Unlike the first three generations, the fourth generation GS is not based on any Crown models as it is built on a separate New N platform.

At its debut, the fourth generation model was shown in rear-wheel drive GS 350 (GRL10) form, powered by a V6 engine linked with a six-speed automatic transmission. Three driving modes are featured, ranging from fuel-conserving &quot;Eco&quot; to &quot;Sport S&quot; and &quot;Sport S+&quot; which facilitate more sporty transmission shifting and engine throttle settings, as well as suspension damper and steering adjustments. The chassis has been redesigned, and overall curb weight is reduced. To reduce unsprung mass the new GS utilizes aluminum for all its suspension components. The GS 350 F Sport adds a rear-wheel steering system for improved handling on rear wheel drive models. New larger 14-inch brakes come standard as well as 19-inch F Sport wheels, a new front bumper, rear spoiler, F Sport steering wheel, F Sport seats and a new suspension system with AVS adjustable dampers.

The redesigned interior gains the Lexus Remote Touch mouse controller system in place of the previous touchscreen, linked to a split-view widescreen dashboard display.

It also features a new technology, Save energy + airflow control (S-FLOW), which is the world&#x27;s first system that sends air only to where vehicle occupants are seated in order to maintain and improve comfort while also improving fuel efficiency.

Other interior features include Mark Levinson surround sound system. Front 18-way power seats are available; 10-way power seats are equipped standard. Optional features further include a pre-collision system, Heads-Up Display, blind spot monitor, lane keep assist, and Driver Monitoring System.

Variants such as the GS 350 and GS 250, as well as their F Sport variants, began sales in Japan on 26 January 2012, followed by the GS 450h and the GS 450h F Sport on 19 March 2012. Sales for the fourth generation in the US began in February 2012 for models including the GS 350 and GS 350 F Sport, with the hybrid version following several months after. A smaller-displacement model, the GS 250 (GRL11), was shown at the 2011 Auto Guangzhou, targeted for sales in China, Japan, Australia and the UK, but not the US.

The GS 450h (GWL10), rated at and now using an Atkinson cycle design, has a 35 percent improvement in fuel economy over the previous generation GS 450h, and has a higher combined EPA fuel efficiency rating (31 mpg) than the 306 horsepower GS 350 (23 mpg). Trunk space is improved both for the hybrid and standard models. The GS 450h features standard full LED headlamps and a bamboo trimmed interior. The vehicle was unveiled at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show.

For the 2014 model year, changes to GS 350 includes an eight-speed automatic transmission for rear-wheel drive (RWD) models, introduction of F SPORT package (optional Lexus Dynamic Handling system with dynamic rear steering (DRS), electric power steering, variable gear ratio steering (VGRS)), integrated Siri Eyes Free mode from Apple (compatible with iPhone 4S and newer), flush mounted sensors for available intuitive park assist, full color display added to the optional head-up display, available blind spot monitor adds rear cross traffic alert and power-folding mirrors, Luxury Package changes (LED foglamps, Superchrome finish for 18-inch wheels, and the rear armrest control panel display adds display option to view radio station and song title information), optional power trunk opener, Lexus Night View system discontinued.

The GS 300h hybrid model includes a 2.5-liter Atkinson cycle inline-four engine with a D-4S direct injection technology, derived from the third generation IS. The vehicle was unveiled at the 2013 Shanghai Motor Show. The vehicle went on sale in China, Europe, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand, but not in the US.

It is a version of Lexus GS 300h for European market, with 2.5-liter Atkinson cycle four-cylinder engine (181PS), two electric motors, a hard-drive navigation system with a 12.3-inch Monitor and Lexus Connected Services, Mark Levinson audio system, DVD player and rear-view camera with a monitor, among other features. The vehicle went on sale on 11 January 2014.

===2015–2020===
The revised GS debuted at Monterey Car Week in August 2015. Changes include a GS 200t variant equipped with the 2.0-liter &quot;8AR-FTS&quot; turbocharged engine to replace the GS 250, and an update to the 3.5-liter V6, now upgraded to &quot;2GR-FKS&quot; specification. that uses the Atkinson cycle and features founded on the previous 2GR-FSE motor. Additional changes include revised exterior elements (including front and rear trim, exterior lighting, wheels, and rocker panels), new active safety features, and a revised infotainment system. The GS 200t was renamed to GS 300 for the 2018 North American model year.

In 2018, Lexus discontinued the GS for European markets and replaced it with the front-wheel drive ES already sold in North America and some Asian countries. Lexus issued a press release saying that production of the GS will end .


==== GS F ====
The high performance &quot;F&quot; version of the GS, the GS F, was unveiled at the 2015 North American International Auto Show. It went on sale in the United States in November 2015 for the 2016 model year.

The GS F features a 5.0 L (4,969 cc) &quot;2UR-GSE&quot; V8 engine with Atkinson cycle at cruising speeds, delivering a maximum output of 473 PS (467 bhp; 348 kW) at 7100 rpm and 389 lb⋅ft (527 N⋅m) of torque at 4800–5600 rpm. It is paired with a Toyota AA80E 8-speed transmission built by Aisin.

<text> (; &quot;service in the French style&quot;) is the practice of serving various dishes of a meal at the same time, with the diners helping themselves from the serving dishes. That contrasts to (&quot;service in the Russian style&quot;) in which dishes are brought to the table sequentially and served individually, portioned by servants. 

Formal dinners were served &quot;à la française&quot; from the Middle Ages to the 19th century, but in the modern era it has been largely supplanted by &quot;service à la russe&quot; in restaurants. &quot;Service à la française&quot; still exists today in the form of the &quot;buffet&quot;, and remains popular for small and large gatherings in homes, companies, hotels, and other group settings. It is also similar to the Chinese style of serving large groups in many Chinese restaurants.

==History==
The formalized was a creation of the Baroque period, helped by the growth of published cookbooks setting out grand dining as it was practiced at the French court, led by François Pierre de la Varenne&#x27;s &quot;Le Cuisinier françois&quot; (1651) and &quot;Le Pâtissier françois&quot; (1653). As in other matters of taste and fashion, France took over from Italy as the leader of Europe, and by the 18th century the French style was diffused across the rest of Europe, and those who could afford them hired French chefs. 

Over the course of the 19th century, was replaced by &quot;service à la russe&quot; in grand dining. This had the advantage of making the food much hotter when it reached the diner, and reducing the huge number of dishes and condiments previously found on the table at the same time. It also ensured that everybody could taste everything they wanted, which in practice the old system often did not allow. On the other hand, the effect of magnificent profusion was reduced, and many more footmen and more tableware were required, making it an option only the rich could afford. It also reduced the time spent at the table, and the amount of food needed.

==Organization of the meal==
The meal was divided into two, three or four courses, &quot;removes&quot; or &quot;services&quot;: soup and fish; meat entrées; and desserts, all with various side dishes. A supper, long after the main dinner, might just have one course, plus dessert. Each course included a variety of dishes, all set at the same time at the table. Guests served themselves and their neighbours; the men were generally supposed to help the ladies next to them. The table was set and the first remove placed on the table before the guests entered the dining room. The serving dishes might be removed after the first course of soup or fish, or not. They were always cleared after the entrées, before serving dessert, except for a period in the mid-18th century, when at grand meals the desserts were placed in the centre of the table from the start of the meal. 

There was supposed, by the cookery books, to be a more or less fixed ratio of around four dishes per diner, all different. Unlike today, when doubling the number of diners from say 12 to 24 will normally mean doubling the quantity prepared of each type of food, &quot;service à la française&quot; doubled the number of different dishes of all types, to about 96. Therefore, in a large dinner, there was no chance for every diner to taste everything on the table, and two diners at different points around the table might well both have a hearty dinner, without tasting any of the same food, as with a large modern buffet. But whereas in the Middle Ages and Renaissance the best food was placed on the table with the most important diners, or the centre of a very large table, the lesser tables or edges of the main table doing rather less well, now the quality of food was even across the table. But now only diners accepted as more or less of the same status eat in the same room at all.

In practice, guests might not be aware of what all the many dishes on the table were, or be able to see or obtain them. The long account in a letter from a young American lady of a dinner for 18 people on New Year&#x27;s Day 1852 at an aristocratic English country house, includes &quot;I cannot tell you how many kinds of soup there were. Suffice it, that mine was most delicious&quot;. 

In the Renaissance the dessert course might be served in a different room, or at the other end of a large room, sometimes in buffet style. 

&quot;Service à la française&quot; sometimes required so much food to be set out that it was the custom of some hosts to have a second dinner party the following day, using what was left over for a slightly smaller number of less-important guests. William Makepeace Thackeray&#x27;s character Major Pendennis (1850) is &quot;indignant at being invited to a &#x27;second-day dinner&#x27;&quot;.

Until about 1800, no glasses or drinks were on the table at the start of the meal. Footmen were beckoned and brought a salver with a glass of wine, and a decanter of water to dilute it if desired.

== The “Classical Order” of table service ==

The “Classical Order” of table service emerged in France in the early 17th century and first appeared in print in 1651 in La Varenne’s &quot;Le Cuisinier françois&quot;. The Classical meal is composed of five stages: potage, entrée, roast, entremets, and dessert. Each stage is characterized by certain types of dishes largely unique to that stage, each distinguished from the other by their ingredients, cooking methods, and serving temperatures. The distinctions between the stages were at first loosely observed, or perhaps more accurately, the &quot;rules&quot; were in a formative stage for several decades. By the early 18th century, though, the stages of the meal were increasingly rigid.

Each stage could be presented in a separate course, or the stages could be grouped together to produce a meal of fewer courses. Regardless of the presentation on the table, the stages of the meal were consumed in the same order, known to those attending the meal but rarely evident in contemporaneous menus or descriptions of meals.

The meal consistently began with potages.

Entrées on meat days included butchers&#x27; meats (but not ham), suckling pig, domestic fowl, furred and feathered game, and offal. Entrées were typically cooked in moist heat in preparations such as sautés, ragoûts, and fricassées. Meat or fowl might be roasted, but they were always finished in a sauce. Other common entrées were meat pies and fritters. On lean days, fish and eggs replaced meat and fowl in every course. In Lent, though, eggs were not served at any meal until the 19th century, when eggs became increasingly common in Lent. Vegetables were used only in sauces or garnishes; they were not served as a separate dish in the entrée stage of the meal, even on lean days. All entrées were served hot, which was a salient feature of entrées until the 19th century.

In the 18th century, the &quot;bouilli&quot;, a joint of boiled beef, was the first entrée consumed at the meal after the potages. By the 1820s, the bouilli was no longer routinely served at fine dinners.

The &quot;relevé&quot; was in origin an entrée, a spit-roasted joint served in a sauce and consumed after the other entrées. By the late 18th century, relevés had come to be considered a distinct stage of the meal consisting of any large joint consumed after the other entrées. On lean days, relevés were typically whole fish served in a sauce, and in the 19th century, whole fish became a classic relevé, even on meat days. Also in the 19th century, relevés came to be served before the other entrées rather than after, essentially replacing the &quot;bouilli&quot; formerly consumed at that point in the meal.

In the early 18th century, &quot;hors d’œuvres&quot; were little extra dishes served alongside both entrées and entremets, typically consumed at the end of the given course. They were at first considered to be small entrées or entremets; but by the late 18th century, hors d’œuvre had come to be considered a distinct stage of the meal that was consumed immediately after the potages and before the entrées and relevés. 

Roasts on meat days included domestic fowl, feathered game, and small furred game. The fowl and game were spit-roasted and nicely browned, served &quot;dry&quot; and not in a sauce or ragoût, although sauces might be served separately. Large cuts of roasted butcher&#x27;s meat and furred game were not served in the roast course until well into the 19th century. On lean days, whole fish replaced meat-day roasts, but the fish were poached or fried, not roasted. The fish were substitutions or counterparts to the roasts served on meat days, corresponding to their position in the meal but not their cooking method. The fish for the roast course were served &quot;dry&quot;, often with the scales still attached, and sauces might be served on the side, as for roasts on meat days.

Salads were served with the roast. Salads were often considered to be a sort of entremets, but they were usually mentioned separately from the other entremets.

Entremets were the last dishes served from the kitchen. They were a varied selection of chilled meats, hot vegetables, hot and cold sweet dishes, and other dishes like vegetable and cheese fritters.

Dessert consisted of items &quot;from the storeroom&quot; (&quot;de l&#x27;office&quot;), including fresh, stewed, preserved, and dried fruits; fruit jellies; cheese and other dairy dishes; dry biscuits (cookies) and wafers; and, beginning in the mid-18th century, ices and petits fours. Because the dishes in the dessert course were not prepared in the kitchen, dessert was often not included on menus or in descriptions of meals, and the stated number of courses was thus often fewer by one than the actual number of courses served.

Beginning in the early 19th century, the meal often included a small glass of chilled spirits or frozen punch between courses at the midpoint of the meal. In a 4-course meal, it was typically served after the roast, and in a 3-course meal, before the roast. The drink, the &quot;coup du milieu&quot;, was not considered a distinct stage of the meal and was not often included on menus.

The stages of the meal could be presented in 5, 4, or 3 courses. Some meals, particularly meals other than dinner, were presented in a single course, a distinct type of service called an &quot;ambigu&quot;. 

While there are many variations in the details, the following arrangements are characteristic of meals from the mid-17th century to the late 19th-century. Note that hors d&#x27;œuvres and relevés in the descriptions were not distinct stages of the meal in the 17th century. Note also that in the 19th century, relevés were increasingly served before the other entrées, not after them.

Meals with five courses are attested from the mid-17th to the mid-18th century by La Varenne (1651), Pierre de Lune (1662), Louis Liger (1711), François Marin (1739), and Menon (1739).
#Potage + hors d&#x27;œuvre
#Entrée + relevé
#Roast + salad
#Entremets
#Dessert

Meals with four courses are attested from the mid-17th to the early-19th century by L.S.R (1674), Jean Ribou (1708), Menon (1739), Menon (1746), &quot;Dictionnaire portatif de cuisine, d’office, et de distillation&quot; (1767), and Grimod de La Reynière (1805). 
# Potage + hors d’œuvre + entrée + relevé
# Roast + salad
# Entremets
# Dessert

Meals with three courses are attested from the mid-16th to the late-19th century by François Massialot (1691), Nicolas Audiger (1692), Menon (1746), &quot;Manuel de Gastronomie&quot; (1825), Urbain Dubois (1856), and &quot;Dictionnaire universel de la Vie pratique à la ville et à la campagne&quot; (1882). Beginning in the early 19th century, meals of three courses were the most common type of table service.
# Potage + hors d’œuvre + entrée + relevé
# Roast + salad + entremets
# Dessert

==Modifications==

A modified form of &quot;service à la française&quot; is known as &quot;family-style&quot; in less formal restaurants. This form of service replicates the way in which small family meals are sometimes served. 

The &quot;buffet&quot; style is a variation of the French service in which all of the food is available, at the correct temperature, in a serving space other than the dining table, and guests serve themselves. 

Buffets can vary from the informal (a gathering of friends in a home, or the serving of brunch at a hotel) to the formal setting of a wedding reception. The &quot;buffet&quot; format is preferred on occasions where a very large number of guests is to be accommodated efficiently by a small number of service personnel.

<text>The Schulze method (), also known as the beatpath method, is a single winner ranked-choice voting rule developed by Markus Schulze. The Schulze method is a Condorcet completion method, which means it will elect a majority-preferred candidate if one exists. In other words, if most people rank &quot;A&quot; above &quot;B&quot;, &quot;A&quot; will defeat &quot;B&quot; (whenever this is possible). Schulze&#x27;s method breaks cyclic ties by using indirect victories. The idea is that if Alice beats Bob, and Bob beats Charlie, then Alice (indirectly) beats Charlie; this kind of indirect win is called a &quot;beatpath&quot;.

For proportional representation, a single transferable vote (STV) variant known as Schulze STV also exists. The Schulze method is used by several organizations including Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo, Pirate Party political parties and many others. It was also used by Wikimedia prior to their adoption of score voting.

== Description of the method ==

Schulze&#x27;s method uses ranked ballots with equal ratings allowed. There are two common (equivalent) descriptions of Schulze&#x27;s method.

=== Beatpath explanation ===
The idea behind Schulze&#x27;s method is that if Alice defeats Bob, and Bob beats Charlie, then Alice &quot;indirectly&quot; defeats Charlie. These chained sequences of &quot;beats&quot; are called &#x27;beatpaths&#x27;.

Every beatpath is assigned a particular &quot;strength&quot;. The strength of a single-step beatpath from Alice to Bob is just the number of voters who rank Alice over Bob. For a longer beatpath, consisting of multiple beats, a beatpath is as strong as its weakest link (i.e. the beat with the smallest number of winning votes).

We say Alice has a &quot;beatpath-win&quot; over Bob if her strongest beatpath to Bob is stronger than all of Bob&#x27;s strongest beatpaths to Alice. The winner is the candidate who has a beatpath-win over every other candidate.

Markus Schulze proved that this definition of a beatpath-win is transitive: in other words, if Alice has a beatpath-win over Bob, and Bob has a beatpath-win over Charlie, Alice has a beatpath-win over Charlie. As a result, the Schulze method is a Condorcet method, providing a full extension of the majority rule to any set of ballots.

=== Iterative description ===
The Schulze winner can also be constructed iteratively, using a defeat-dropping method:

# Draw a directed graph with all the candidates as nodes; label the edges with the number of votes supporting the winner.
# If there is more than one candidate left:
#* Check if any candidates are tied (and if so, break the ties by random ballot).
#* Eliminate all candidates outside the majority-preferred set.
#* Delete the edge closest to being tied.

The winner is the only candidate left at the end of the procedure.

== Example ==
In the following example 45 voters rank 5 candidates.

The pairwise preferences have to be computed first. For example, when comparing &#x27; and &#x27; pairwise, there are voters who prefer &#x27; to &#x27;, and voters who prefer &#x27; to &#x27;. So formula_1 and formula_2. The full set of pairwise preferences is:
The cells for d[X, Y] have a light green background if d[X, Y] &gt; d[Y, X], otherwise the background is light red. There is no undisputed winner by only looking at the pairwise differences here.

Now the strongest paths have to be identified. To help visualize the strongest paths, the set of pairwise preferences is depicted in the diagram on the right in the form of a directed graph. An arrow from the node representing a candidate X to the one representing a candidate Y is labelled with d[X, Y]. To avoid cluttering the diagram, an arrow has only been drawn from X to Y when d[X, Y] &gt; d[Y, X] (i.e. the table cells with light green background), omitting the one in the opposite direction (the table cells with light red background).

One example of computing the strongest path strength is p[B, D] = 33: the strongest path from B to D is the direct path (B, D) which has strength 33. But when computing p[A, C], the strongest path from A to C is not the direct path (A, C) of strength 26, rather the strongest path is the indirect path (A, D, C) which has strength min(30, 28) = 28. The &quot;strength&quot; of a path is the strength of its weakest link.

For each pair of candidates X and Y, the following table shows the strongest path from candidate X to candidate Y in red, with the weakest link underlined.

Now the output of the Schulze method can be determined. For example, when comparing &#x27; and &#x27;, since formula_3, for the Schulze method candidate &#x27; is &quot;better&quot; than candidate &#x27;. Another example is that formula_4, so candidate E is &quot;better&quot; than candidate D. Continuing in this way, the result is that the Schulze ranking is formula_5, and &#x27; wins. In other words, &#x27; wins since formula_6 for every other candidate X.

== Implementation ==
The only difficult step in implementing the Schulze method is computing the strongest path strengths. However, this is a well-known problem in graph theory sometimes called the widest path problem. One simple way to compute the strengths, therefore, is a variant of the Floyd–Warshall algorithm. The following pseudocode illustrates the algorithm.
# Input: d[i,j], the number of voters who prefer candidate i to candidate j.
# Output: p[i,j], the strength of the strongest path from candidate i to candidate j.

for i from 1 to C
 for j from 1 to C
 if i ≠ j then
 if d[i,j] &gt; d[j,i] then
 p[i,j] := d[i,j]
 else
 p[i,j] := 0

for i from 1 to C
 for j from 1 to C
 if i ≠ j then
 for k from 1 to C
 if i ≠ k and j ≠ k then
 p[j,k] := max (p[j,k], min (p[j,i], p[i,k]))
This algorithm is efficient and has running time O(&quot;C&quot;3) where &quot;C&quot; is the number of candidates.

== Ties and alternative implementations ==
When allowing users to have ties in their preferences, the outcome of the Schulze method naturally depends on how these ties are interpreted in defining d[*,*]. Two natural choices are that d[A, B] represents either the number of voters who strictly prefer A to B (A&gt;B), or the &quot;margin&quot; of (voters with A&gt;B) minus (voters with B&gt;A). But no matter how the &quot;d&quot;s are defined, the Schulze ranking has no cycles, and assuming the &quot;d&quot;s are unique it has no ties.

Although ties in the Schulze ranking are unlikely, they are possible. Schulze&#x27;s original paper recommended breaking ties by random ballot.

There is another alternative way to &quot;demonstrate&quot; the winner of the Schulze method. This method is equivalent to the others described here, but the presentation is optimized for the significance of steps being &quot;visually apparent&quot; as a human goes through it, not for computation.

# Make the results table, called the &quot;matrix of pairwise preferences&quot;, such as used above in the example. Then, every positive number is a pairwise win for the candidate on that row (and marked green), ties are zeroes, and losses are negative (marked red). Order the candidates by how long they last in elimination.
# If there is a candidate with no red on their line, they win.
# Otherwise, draw a square box around the Schwartz set in the upper left corner. It can be described as the minimal &quot;winner&#x27;s circle&quot; of candidates who do not lose to anyone outside the circle. Note that to the right of the box there is no red, which means it is a winner&#x27;s circle, and note that within the box there is no reordering possible that would produce a smaller winner&#x27;s circle.
# Cut away every part of the table outside the box.
# If there is still no candidate with no red on their line, something needs to be compromised on; every candidate lost some race, and the loss we tolerate the best is the one where the loser obtained the most votes. So, take the red cell with the highest number (if going by margins, the least negative), make it green—or any color other than red—and go back step 2.

Here is a margins table made from the above example. Note the change of order used for demonstration purposes.

The first drop (A&#x27;s loss to E by 1 vote) does not help shrink the Schwartz set.

So we get straight to the second drop (E&#x27;s loss to C by 3 votes), and that shows us the winner, E, with its clear row.
This method can also be used to calculate a result, if the table is remade in such a way that one can conveniently and reliably rearrange the order of the candidates on both the row and the column, with the same order used on both at all times.

== Satisfied and failed criteria ==
=== Satisfied criteria ===
The Schulze method satisfies the following criteria:

* Monotonicity criterion
* Majority criterion
* Majority loser criterion
* Condorcet criterion
* Condorcet loser criterion
* Smith criterion
* Independence of Smith-dominated alternatives
* Mutual majority criterion
* Independence of clones
* Reversal symmetry
* Mono-append
* Mono-add-plump
* Resolvability criterion
* Polynomial runtime
* prudence
* MinMax sets
* Woodall&#x27;s plurality criterion if winning votes are used for d[X,Y]
* Symmetric-completion if margins are used for d[X,Y]
=== Failed criteria ===
Since the Schulze method satisfies the Condorcet criterion, it automatically fails the following criteria:

* Participation
* Consistency
* Invulnerability to burying
* Later-no-harm

Likewise, since the Schulze method is not a dictatorship and is a ranked voting system (not rated), Arrow&#x27;s Theorem implies it fails independence of irrelevant alternatives, meaning it can be vulnerable to the spoiler effect in some rare circumstances. The Schulze method also fails Peyton Young&#x27;s criterion of Local Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives.

=== Comparison table ===
The following table compares the Schulze method with other single-winner election methods:
=== Difference from ranked pairs ===
Ranked pairs is another Condorcet method which is very similar to Schulze&#x27;s rule, and typically produces the same outcome. There are slight differences, however. The main difference between the beatpath method and ranked pairs is that Schulze retains behavior closer to minimax. Say that the minimax score of a set X of candidates is the strength of the strongest pairwise win of a candidate A ∉ X against a candidate B ∈ X. Then the Schulze method, but not ranked pairs, guarantees the winner is always a candidate of the set with minimum minimax score. This is the sense in which the Schulze method minimizes the largest majority that has to be reversed when determining the winner.

On the other hand, Ranked Pairs minimizes the largest majority that has to be reversed to determine the order of finish. In other words, when Ranked Pairs and the Schulze method produce different orders of finish, for the majorities on which the two orders of finish disagree, the Schulze order reverses a larger majority than the Ranked Pairs order.

== History ==
The Schulze method was developed by Markus Schulze in 1997. It was first discussed in public mailing lists in 1997–1998 and in 2000. In 2011, Schulze published the method in the academic journal &quot;Social Choice and Welfare&quot;.

== Usage ==
=== Government ===
The Schulze method is used by the city of Silla, Spain for all referendums. It is also used by the cities of Turin and San Donà di Piave in Italy and by the London Borough of Southwark through their use of the WeGovNow platform, which in turn uses the LiquidFeedback decision tool.

=== Political parties ===
Schulze was adopted by the Pirate Party of Sweden (2009), and the Pirate Party of Germany (2010). The Boise, Idaho chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America in February chose this method for their first special election held in March 2018.

<text>A torus bundle, in the sub-field of geometric topology in mathematics, is a kind of surface bundle over the circle, which in turn is a class of three-manifolds.

==Construction==
To obtain a torus bundle: let formula_1 be an orientation-preserving homeomorphism of the two-dimensional torus formula_2 to itself. Then the three-manifold formula_3 is obtained by
* taking the Cartesian product of formula_2 and the unit interval and 
* gluing one component of the boundary of the resulting manifold to the other boundary component via the map formula_1.

Then formula_3 is the torus bundle with monodromy formula_1. 

==Examples==
For example, if formula_1 is the identity map (i.e., the map which fixes every point of the torus) then the resulting torus bundle formula_3 is the three-torus: the Cartesian product of three circles.

Seeing the possible kinds of torus bundles in more detail requires an understanding of William Thurston&#x27;s geometrization program. Briefly, if formula_1 is finite order, then the manifold formula_3 has Euclidean geometry. If formula_1 is a power of a Dehn twist then formula_3 has Nil geometry. Finally, if formula_1 is an Anosov map then the resulting three-manifold has Sol geometry.

These three cases exactly correspond to the three possibilities for the absolute value of the trace of the action of formula_1 on the homology of the torus: either less than two, equal to two, or greater than two.

<text>Mange () is a type of skin disease caused by parasitic mites. Because various species of mites also infect plants, birds and reptiles, the term &quot;mange&quot;, or colloquially &quot;the mange&quot;, suggesting poor condition of the skin and fur due to the infection, is sometimes reserved for pathological mite-infestation of nonhuman mammals. Thus, mange includes mite-associated skin disease in domestic mammals (cats and dogs), in livestock (such as sheep scab), and in wild mammals (for example, foxes, coyotes, cougars, Tasmanian devils, and wombats). Severe mange caused by mites has been observed in wild bears. Since mites belong to the arachnid subclass Acari (also called Acarina), another term for mite infestation is acariasis.

Parasitic mites that cause mange in mammals embed themselves in either skin or hair follicles in the animal, depending upon their genus. &quot;Sarcoptes&quot; spp. burrow into skin, while &quot;Demodex&quot; spp. live in follicles.

In humans, these two types of mite infections, which would be known as &quot;mange&quot; in furry mammals, are instead known respectively as scabies and demodicosis.

== Classification ==

=== Demodectic mange ===

Also called demodicosis or red mange, demodectic mange is caused by a sensitivity to and overpopulation of &quot;Demodex&quot; spp. The two types of demodectic mange are localized and generalized. Localized consists of four spots or less. &quot;Demodex&quot; is not zoonotic and is not transferable across species. Each host species has its own species of &quot;Demodex&quot;. For example, dogs are hosts to &quot;Demodex canis&quot; and cats are hosts to &quot;Demodex cati&quot;. A type of demodectic infection in humans is known, but is less commonly symptomatic. See &quot;Demodex folliculorum&quot;.

=== Sarcoptic mange ===

Sarcoptic mange, also known as canine scabies, is a highly contagious infestation of &quot;Sarcoptes scabiei var.&quot; &quot;canis&quot;, a burrowing mite. The canine sarcoptic mite can also infest cats, pigs, horses, sheep, and various other species. The human analog of burrowing mite infection, due to a closely related species, is called scabies (the &quot;seven-year itch&quot;).

Burrowing mites are in the family Sarcoptidae. They dig into and through the skin, causing intense itching from an allergic reaction to the mite&#x27;s feces, and crusting that can quickly become infected. Hair loss and crusting frequently appear first on elbows and ears. Skin damage can occur from the dog&#x27;s intense scratching and biting. Secondary skin infection is also common. Dogs with chronic sarcoptic mange are often in poor condition, and in both animals and humans, immune suppression from starvation or any other disease causes this type of mange to develop into a highly crusted form in which the burden of mites is far higher than that in initially-healthy individuals.

== Diagnosis ==
Veterinarians usually attempt diagnosis with skin scrapings from multiple areas, which are then examined under a microscope for mites. &quot;Sarcoptes&quot; mites, because they may be present in relatively low numbers, and because they are often removed by dogs chewing at themselves, may be difficult to demonstrate. As a result, diagnosis in sarcoptic mange is often based on symptoms rather than actual confirmation of the presence of mites. A common and simple way of determining if a dog has mange is if it displays what is called a &quot;pedal-pinna reflex&quot;, which is when the dog moves one of its hind legs in a scratching motion as the ear is being manipulated and scratched gently by the examiner; because the mites proliferate on the ear margins in nearly all cases at some point, this method works over 95% of the time. It is helpful in cases where all symptoms of mange are present but no mites are observed with a microscope. The test is also positive in animals with ear mites, an ear canal infection caused by a different but closely related mite (treatment is often the same). In some countries, an available serologic test may be useful in diagnosis.

== Treatment ==
Affected dogs are sometimes isolated from other dogs and their bedding, and places they have occupied must be thoroughly cleaned. Other dogs in contact with a diagnosed case should be evaluated and treated. A number of parasitical treatments are useful in treating canine scabies. Sulfurated lime (a mixture of calcium polysulfides) rinses applied weekly or biweekly are effective (the concentrated form for use on plants as a fungicide must be diluted 1:16 or 1:32 for use on animal skin).

Selamectin is licensed for treatment in dogs by veterinary prescription in several countries; it is applied as a dose directly to the skin, once per month (the drug does not wash off). A related and older drug ivermectin is also effective and can be given by mouth for two to four weekly treatments or until two negative skin scrapings are achieved. Oral ivermectin is not safe to use on some collie-like herding dogs, however, due to possible homozygous MDR1 (P-glycoprotein) mutations that increase its toxicity by allowing it into the brain. Ivermectin injections are also effective and given either weekly or every two weeks in one to four doses, although the same MDR1 dog restrictions apply.

Affected cats can be treated with fipronil and milbemycin oxime.

Topical 0.01% ivermectin in oil (Acarexx) has been reported to be effective in humans, and all mite infections in many types of animals (especially in ear mite infections where the animal cannot lick the treated area), and is so poorly absorbed that systemic toxicity is less likely in these sites. Nevertheless, topical ivermectin has not been well enough tested to be approved for this use in dogs, and is theoretically much more dangerous in zones where the animal can potentially lick the treated area. Selamectin applied to the skin (topically) has some of the same theoretical problems in collies and MDR1 dogs as ivermectin, but it has nevertheless been approved for use for all dogs provided that the animal can be observed for eight hours after the first monthly treatment. Topical permethrin is also effective in both dogs and humans, but is toxic to cats.

Afoxolaner (oral treatment with a chewable tablet containing afoxolaner 2.27% w/w) has been shown to be efficient against both sarcoptic and demodectic mange in dogs.

Free-ranging wombats are commonly treated topically with moxidectin by wildlife carers in Australia, because it poses a low risk. 

Sarcoptic mange is transmissible to humans who come into prolonged contact with infested animals, and is distinguished from human scabies by its distribution on skin surfaces covered by clothing. For treatment of sarcoptic infection in humans, see scabies. For demodetic infection in humans, which is not as severe as it is in animals with thicker coats (such as dogs), see &quot;Demodex folliculorum&quot;.

<text>Fort Zeelandia is a fortress in Paramaribo, Suriname. In 1640 the French built a wooden fort on the spot which, during British colonial period, was reinforced and became Fort Willoughby. It was taken by the Dutch in 1667 and renamed Fort Zeelandia.

==History==
Surinam, a small English colony, was established in 1650 by Major Anthony Rowse on behalf of the governor of Barbados, Francis Willoughby. In 1651 the English reinforced the abandoned French fort near present-day Paramaribo, calling it Fort Willoughby. 

In 1667 the Dutch Admiral Abraham Crijnssen captured Fort Willoughby from forces under Lieutenant-Governor William Byam. The battle lasted only three hours before British munitions were exhausted. Crijnssen renamed the captured fort Fort Zeelandia, creating the Dutch colony of Surinam. Crijnssen also recaptured the Essequibo-Pomeroon Colony.

Over the years, it started to become obsolete as a military asset and, in 1772, there were even plans to tear it down.

After Surinamese independence in 1975, under the military government of Dési Bouterse in the 1980s, Fort Zeelandia was the location of the &quot;December murders&quot; of 1982 and was used to hold and torture political prisoners.

The Surinamese Museum is located in Fort Zeelandia. The museum has a large collection of ethnographica. Its collections contain archeology, visual arts, colonial furniture, textiles and historical photos.

The Nola Hatterman Art Academy is located in the former commander&#x27;s house.

<doc id="680747" wikidata="Q740954" url="?curid=680747" title="Pocomoke River">
<text>The Pocomoke River stretches approximately from southern Delaware through southeastern Maryland in the United States. At its mouth, the river is essentially an arm of Chesapeake Bay, whereas the upper river flows through a series of relatively inaccessible wetlands called the Great Cypress Swamp, largely populated by Loblolly Pine, Red Maple and Bald Cypress. The river is the easternmost river that flows into Chesapeake Bay.
&quot;Pocomoke&quot; , though traditionally interpreted as &quot;dark (or black) water&quot; by local residents, is now agreed by scholars of the Algonquian languages to be derived from the words for &quot;broken (or pierced) ground.&quot;

==Description==
It rises in several forks in the Great Cypress Swamp in southern Sussex County, Delaware. From there, it flows south into Maryland, forming the boundary between Wicomico and Worcester counties and flowing through the swamps that are named for the river. At Porter&#x27;s Crossing it turns southwest, broadening into a slow meandering river, flowing past the town of Snow Hill, and then through the Pocomoke River State Forest and past Pocomoke River State Park. It then flows past Pocomoke City, and enters Pocomoke Sound on the Chesapeake Bay on the state line between Maryland and Virginia.

It receives Nassawango Creek from the northwest approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) southwest of Snow Hill. It receives Dividing Creek from the north approximately 1 mile northeast of Pocomoke City.

The Pocomoke River is designated as a &quot;Scenic&quot; river by the State of Maryland.

==History==
In 1635 the mouth of the river was the scene of the first recorded battle in North America between Englishmen. The dispute was between the Virginia Company and Lord Baltimore, the proprietor of the Maryland Colony, over the rights to Kent Island at the mouth of the Chester River. The dispute was eventually resolved with a victory for the Maryland colonists.

During the colonial era, various landings grew up along the river, some of which became towns, while others faded into obscurity with the decline of water-borne transport. From the mouth of the river, they are (or were), on the right bank: the landings at Shelltown (called for many years Steamboat Landing) and Rehobeth (both in Somerset County), Puncheon Landing, Stevens Ferry, Cottinghams Ferry, Milburn Landing (now in the Milburn Landing section of the Pocomoke River State Park), and Adams Wharf, all in Worcester County. The landings on the left bank are (or were): Pitts Creek Landing in Accomack County, Virginia, Cedar Hall Landing, Stevens Landing (also called Stevens Ferry, which became in turn Newtown and then Pocomoke City), Cottinghams Ferry, Mattapony Landing (also known as Gibbs Ferry), and finally Snow Hill, at the head of navigation, also all in Worcester County.

In 1785, after years of disputes over fishing in Pocomoke Sound and on the Pocomoke River, Maryland and Virginia entered into an interstate compact that regulated fishing in the area, established a common and free waterway, and covered how criminal trials concerning each other&#x27;s citizens should be handled. In &quot;Wharton v. Wise&quot;, 153 U.S. 155 (1894), the Supreme Court of the United States determined that Pocomoke Sound was not covered by this famous interstate compact.

In 1913, to provide better navigation, the mouth of the river was dredged by the United States Army Corps of Engineers.

In the 1990s, a microorganism outbreak on the lower river, possibly &quot;Pfiesteria piscicida&quot;, led to widespread fish kills and illness among the watermen who fish the river and Pocomoke Sound. The illnesses included lesions, respiratory problems, and memory loss. As a result, the lower river and Pocomoke Sound were closed to fishing, boating, and swimming. It is currently hypothesized that the microorganism was present before the outbreak but became toxic due to elevated concentrations of organic waste that had built up in this sprawling coastal plain river.

<text>Bejam was a British frozen food supermarket chain founded by John Apthorp in 1968, based in Stanmore, London. The business grew to become the biggest frozen food retailer and largest seller of freezers and microwaves in Britain. The business was purchased by smaller rival, Iceland, in a hostile takeover in 1989.

==History==
The concept of selling only frozen foods was a novel idea in 1968. John Apthorp, worked for &quot;E. A. D. Apthorp&quot;, his family firm of potato merchants, who were bought out by the Ross Group in 1968. Apthorp did not like working within the larger organisation, so he left and opened a single store in Edgware as &quot;Bejam Bulk Buying&quot; in 1968 selling frozen foods. The name, Bejam was an acronym for Brian, Eric, John and Milly and Marion, the names of the Apthorp family members. At the time Britain was behind continental Europe in freezer ownership with less than 1% of households owning one, but by 1973 it had grown to around 2 million homes. By 1973, Bejam had expanded to 72 stores, not just selling frozen food but also freezers themselves, a pioneer in the marketplace, while in the same year it became listed on the London Stock Exchange. The company had many subsidiaries supplying frozen food to the business, including the jointly owned Meatpak Hampshire. Bejam would also buy 50% of Smeets Diepvries, B.V., a Netherlands wholesale distributor of frozen foods in 1973, eventually opening three Bejam stores in the Netherlands. In 1974, the company opened a new jointly owned cold store in Milton Keynes with the National Freight Corporation.

The company grew very quickly during the 1970s, and by 1978 they had grown to 147 stores with of sales space making £2.34 million of profit on £44.23 million turnover. The appliances division joined up with Barclays Bank in 1976 to offer customers credit on fridges and freezers sold in store. Bejam continued to grow, and in 1979 announced record profits of £6.04 million, and had continued to grow in the interim profits report of 1980 to £4.1 million, with the company&#x27;s share price sitting at 59p. The company diversified in 1979 by purchasing 38 restaurants from EMI for £4.78 million, mostly operating under Wimpy and Tennessee Pancake fascias, and announced plans to open a fast food chain called &quot;Trumps&quot;, with the first branch opening in Romford. However, the fast food experiment failed, with 22 of the branches sold in 1980, and in 1981 the business withdrew from the market with a write-down of £1.9 million. It didn&#x27;t however affect the company&#x27;s profits, with the company generating pre-tax profits of £9 million. On the freezer shop front, Bejam purchased seven supermarket sites from BAT for £1.37 million in 1980, and 16 freezer centres owned by Fine Fare.

By 1982, the company turnover had on food sales alone had grown to £208 million. In 1984, the company opened its 200th store in Woodley, Berkshire with a ceremony with Anne, Princess Royal and her then husband Mark Phillips. The firm went head to head with Iceland in 1985, to purchase twelve of the failed freezer food chain Orchard Foods, but lost out to a £910,000 bid by the rival chain which saw Iceland gain its first stores in Bejam&#x27;s territory. By 1986, this had grown to 226 freezer centres, and this was further enhanced by the purchase of
45 Victor Value stores from Tesco in 1986. John Adthorp had contacted Malcolm Walker of Iceland, in 1986 about purchasing the business, which he still held 30% of shares, but nothing further happened after initial conversations. In 1987, the business expanded with the purchases of Lowfreeze, the freezer shop brand of Scottish supermarket chain, Wm Low, nine of the former Sainsbury&#x27;s Freezer Centres and retailer &quot;Wizard Wine&quot;. The company&#x27;s shares rose from 158p to 210p on rumours that both Iceland and Hazelwood Foods were lining up bids, and it was announced that John Adthorp had handed over day-to-day running of the business to Timothy How. The Iceland link was very true, with Adthorp and Walker agreeing a price of 230p per share, however the Bejam board could not agree on the deal and Adthorp would not guarantee to sell his shares to Iceland if he received a higher bid.

In 1988, Iceland made a hostile takeover bid for Bejam, initially in a share offer worth 123p a share at a total of £240 million. Apthorp had stated the offer was &quot;inadequate and substantially and undervalues Bejam&quot;, with Walker criticising Bejam for not issuing a profit forecast. Iceland then amended their offer to include part cash part share at 187p, but the market were failed to be impressed with Bejam&#x27;s share price dropping to 170p, and Adthorp said he would not accept the offer. On the 30 December, Lloyd&#x27;s Bank, the registrar for the share offer declared that 50.09% of the shareholders in Bejam had accepted the offer.

<doc id="680757" wikidata="Q20706255" url="?curid=680757" title="Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)">
<text>Fort Zeelandia () was a fortress built over ten years from 1624 to 1634 by the Dutch East India Company (VOC), in the town of Anping (now Anping District of Tainan) on Formosa, the former name of central island of Taiwan, during their 38-year rule over the western part of the island. The site had been renamed several times as Fort Orange (奧倫治城; ), Fort Anping (安平城; ), and Taiwan City (臺灣城; ); the current name of the site in Chinese is .

During the seventeenth century, when Europeans from many countries sailed to Asia to develop trade, Formosa became one of East Asia&#x27;s most important transit sites, and Fort Zeelandia an international business center. As trade at the time depended on &quot;military force to control the markets&quot;, the value of Formosa to the Dutch was mainly in its strategic position. &quot;From Formosa the Spanish commerce between Manila and China, and the Portuguese commerce between Macau and Japan could by constant attacks be made so precarious that much of it would be thrown into the hands of the Dutch, while the latter&#x27;s dealings with China and Japan would be subject to no interruptions.&quot;

On behalf of the VOC, ships departing from Formosa could head north to Japan, west to Fujian, or south to Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Cambodia, India, Iran or Europe.

== History ==

=== Arrival and settlement of the Hollanders ===
In August 1624, the Dutch were expelled from the Pescadores, having failed at their attempt to use military force to coerce Ming China into trading with them. Led by Martinus Sonck, who was to be the first Dutch governor of Formosa, they decided to move to Formosa to continue carrying on with trade, and after a day&#x27;s journey, arrived at the settlement of &quot;Taiwan&quot;, or &quot;Tayouan&quot;. Although there were already 25,000 Chinese in the island, and their number increasing due to the war, they did not oppose the large Dutch force. Initially, trade was not as forthcoming as they had expected until, after the departure of Cornelis Reijersen (Reyerszoon) and his succession by Sonck, the Dutch and Chinese came to agreement on trade.
As their first priority was to strengthen defenses, the Dutch built a temporary fort on a raised sandy bank at the entrance to Taoyuan harbor, off the coast of modern-day Anping District, Tainan. There existed a series of sandbars extended from south to north; the east side of such sandbars was known colloquially as the Tai-chiang inland sea. Four years later, the Dutch built a more permanent structure they named &quot;Fort Zeelandia&quot;, probably after the name of the ship that Sonck arrived in. The new fort was sited on the largest sandbar to control the channel for entering the inner sea. This would allow direct access to the sea and with it, supplies and reinforcements from Batavia in event of a siege.

Another smaller fort was built later, Fort Provintia, not far from Zeelandia. Both forts were at locally high elevations, which enabled the exchange of signals between them.

While of solid construction, the fort and its siting were not so much for the purpose of defense against a major enemy as they were for defending against the islanders and for overseeing trade. In addition, the site lacked adequate supplies of fresh water, which had to be shipped from the Formosan mainland. This later proved to be a critical factor in the ousting of the Dutch by Koxinga.

=== Koxinga&#x27;s conquering and the Dutch surrender ===
On 30 April 1661, Ming dynasty-loyalist Koxinga laid siege to the fortress (defended by 2,000 Dutch soldiers) with 400 warships and 25,000 men. After nine months and the loss of 1,600 Dutch lives, the Dutch surrendered on 1 February 1662, when it became clear that no reinforcements were forthcoming from Batavia (present day Jakarta, Java, Indonesia) and when the defenders ran short of fresh water.

Under the Koxinga-Dutch Treaty (1662) signed on 1 February between Koxinga and Frederick Coyett, the Dutch governor, the Dutch surrendered the Fortress and left all goods and VOC property behind. In return, all officials, soldiers and civilians were free to leave with their personal belongings and supplies.

On 9 February, Coyett officially surrendered the fort and led the remaining Dutch forces and civilians back to Batavia by sea, ending 38 years of Dutch colonial rule.

After the siege, Koxinga took Antonius Hambroek&#x27;s teenage daughter as a concubine. Other Dutch (or part Dutch) women were sold to Chinese soldiers to become their concubines.

==Features==

===Design and layout===
Fort Zeelandia included an &quot;inner fort&quot; and an &quot;outer fort&quot;. The inner fort was a square, three-layer construction. The lowest was for storage of ammunition and food. The second features a blank wall. The middle part of each side has a semicircular protruding barrack to strengthen the defense. Above the third story was the administrative center, including offices, garrison and church, all of them independent structures. There were walls on the periphery, with a protruding bastion on each of the four corners, armed with cannons; a watch tower was set at the southwest bastion.

The one-story outer fort was rectangular, with bastions on the northwest and southwest corners, armed with several cannons. Inside the outer fort were residences, a hospital and houses; the plaza was the commercial area.

===Construction details===

Bricks were brought from Java and the mortar consisted of a mixture of sugar, sand, ground seashells and glutinous rice. The fort was designed to be surrounded by three concentric layers of walls and its four corners were built into protruding bastions for better defense. Its layout was typical of European forts of the 17th century. Inside was the military and administration center, church, garrisons, and jailhouse; outside was the downtown. Between the fort and downtown, there were market, slaughterhouse, gallows, execution ground and city weighing station.

Dutch bond was used for laying bricks to build Fort Zeelandia. It is created by alternately laying headers and stretchers in a single course to avoid gaps. The next course is laid so that a header lies in the middle of the stretcher in the course below. The Dutch bricks should have a 10-days kilning, the texture is solid and compact, and its color is red.

<doc id="680772" wikidata="Q648434" url="?curid=680772" title="Pedometer">
<text>A pedometer, or step-counter, is a device, usually portable and electronic or electromechanical, that counts each step a person takes by detecting the motion of the person&#x27;s hands or hips. Because the distance of each person&#x27;s step varies, an informal calibration, performed by the user, is required if presentation of the distance covered in a unit of length (such as in kilometers or miles) is desired, though there are now pedometers that use electronics and software to determine how a person&#x27;s step varies automatically. Distance traveled (by walking or any other means) can be measured directly by a GPS receiver.

Used originally by sports and physical fitness enthusiasts, pedometers are now becoming popular as an everyday exercise counter and motivator. Often worn on the belt and kept on all day, it can record how many steps the wearer has walked that day, and thus the kilometers or miles (distance = number of steps × step length). Some pedometers will also erroneously record movements other than walking, such as bending to tie one&#x27;s shoes, or road bumps incurred while riding a vehicle, though the most advanced devices record fewer of these &#x27;false steps&#x27;. Step counters can give encouragement to compete with oneself in getting fit and losing weight. 

A total of 10,000 steps per day, equivalent to , is recommended by some to be the benchmark for an active lifestyle, although this point is debated among experts, and the target originated in a marketing campaign by a manufacturer of pedometers. Thirty minutes of moderate walking are equivalent to 3,000-4,000 steps as determined by a pedometer. Step counters are being integrated into an increasing number of portable consumer electronic devices such as music players, smartphones, mobile phones and watches (called activity trackers)

==Usage==
Pedometers can be a motivation tool for people wanting to increase their physical activity. Various websites exist to allow people to track their progress; however, many will also find entering their daily step count and a heart-beat count onto a calendar to be motivational as well.
Clinical studies have shown Pedometers to increase physical activity and reduce blood pressure levels and Body Mass Index. A study published in the Journal of The American Medical Association Nov. 2007 concluded, “The results suggest that the use of a pedometer is associated with significant increases in physical activity and significant decreases in body mass index and blood pressure.”

A daily target of 10,000 steps was first proposed.
The target has been recommended by the US Surgeon General and by the UK Department of Health. The main criticisms of setting a universal target are that it is not achievable for older persons with mobility problems or people with chronic diseases, but on the other hand, the target is probably too low for children.

One criticism of the pedometer is that it does not record intensity, but this can be done by making step goals time limited (for example, 1000 steps in 10 minutes counts as moderate exercise).

==History==

Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) envisioned a mechanical pedometer as a device with military applications. The Germanic National Museum in Nuremberg has a pedometer in its collection from around 1590 (see photo). In 1685 Gottfried Leibniz wrote of his time in France, &quot;...several years ago [1672–1674] I saw for the first time an instrument which, when carried, automatically records the number of steps taken by a pedestrian.&quot; In 1780 Abraham-Louis Perrelet of Switzerland created a pedometer, measuring the steps and distance while walking; it was based on a 1770 mechanism of his to power a self-winding watch. A mechanical pedometer obtained from France was introduced in the US by Thomas Jefferson. It is not known if he modified the design; although this pedometer is widely attributed to Jefferson, proof is difficult to obtain as he did not apply for patents on any of his inventions.

=== Japan ===
In 1963, in the lead up to the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, Dr Iwao Ohya, head of one of Tokyo&#x27;s biggest clinics, told Tokyo engineer Juri Kato of clockmaker &quot;Yamasa Tokei Keiki&quot; (&quot;Tokei&quot; means clocks and &quot;Keiki&quot; meters) how concerned Ohya was at the low levels of physical activity in 1960s Japan; the solution, said Ohya, was for everyone to walk 10,000 steps a day. In 1965, after two years of tinkering, Juri Kato produced the Manpo-kei — the &quot;ten-thousand step-meter&quot;. A pedometer called a manpo-kei (meaning &quot;10,000 steps meter&quot; ) was marketed in 1965 by Y. Hatano, who claimed that 10,000 steps a day was ideal.
The effect in 1965 of the release by Yamasa of the Manpo-kei pedometer in Japan was significant. Soon after, the Japan 10,000-step Walking Association sprang up, which shortly had chapters in all 47 prefectures, organising regular walks that could be measured with the Yamasa device.

On 26 February 1980, Juri Kato&#x27;s son Yasuji Kato filed a pedometer patent with the USPTO, currently assigned to Yamasa Tokei Meter Co Ltd.

In 2015, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare also recommended 10,000 steps per day. However, this recommendation is not based on solid evidence.

==Technology==
The technology for a pedometer includes a mechanical sensor and software that counts steps. Early forms used a mechanical switch to detect steps together with a simple counter. If one shakes these devices, one hears a lead ball sliding back and forth, or a pendulum striking stops as it swings. Today advanced step counters rely on MEMS inertial sensors and sophisticated software to detect steps. These MEMS sensors have either 1-, 2- or 3-axis detection of acceleration. The use of MEMS inertial sensors permits more accurate detection of steps and fewer false positives. The software technology used to interpret the output of the inertial sensor and &quot;make sense of accurate steps&quot; varies widely. The problem is compounded by the fact that in modern day-to-day life, such step-counters are expected to count accurately on locations where users frequently carry their devices (attached to the belt, shirt/pants pocket, hand bag, backpack). In recent years more advanced approaches to measure steps have been made with the use of computer vision.

==Accuracy==
The accuracy of step counters varies widely between devices. Typically, step counters are reasonably accurate at a walking pace on a flat surface if the device is placed in its optimal position (usually vertically on the belt clip).
Although traditional step counters are affected dramatically when placed at different angles and locations, recent advances have made them more robust to those non-ideal placements. Still, most step counters falsely count steps when a user is driving a car or makes other habitual motions that the device encounters throughout the day. This error accumulates for users with moderate commutes to work. Accuracy of distance measurement also depends on the user entered step-length.

The best pedometers are accurate to within ± 5% error.

==Integration in personal electronic devices==
===Apple products===
====Nike+iPod Sport Kit====

Apple and Nike, Inc. offer the Nike+iPod Sport Kit, which uses a motion sensor that fits into a Nike shoe or in a pocket worn on the laces of other brands of shoes. The sensor communicates with an iPhone (3GS or higher), iPod touch (2nd generation or higher), iPod nano (4th generation or higher), or dedicated adapter to transmit workout information such as elapsed time, distance traveled, and calories burned.

====Apple iPhone 5s====
The iPhone 5s was the first iPhone to contain an Apple Motion Coprocessor which was denoted the M7 chip paired with the first 64-bit ARM-based Apple processor, the Apple A7 SoC (System on a Chip). The addition of the separate always on coprocessor allows the main CPU to snooze while it tracks the motion of the phone, through the use of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) consisting of an accelerometer, MEMS gyroscope and digital compass. This means that it will know when you&#x27;re jogging or when you&#x27;re in the car, and can take that information and store it without needing to drain the battery by having the main CPU run. It can retrofit the data to apps that you download at a later date, meaning any M7-enabled app that uses the new CoreMotion API will be able to give you information on recent training.

====Apple iPhone 6====
The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus contains the next generation of the Apple Motion Coprocessors with the M8 motion coprocessor, this chip was paired with the vastly improved Apple A8 SoC processor and gained the added sensor input of a Bosch Sensortech Barometer allowing the M8 to sense changes in elevation by the change in barometric pressure.

====Apple iPhone 6s====
The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus improved the Apple Motion Coprocessors by integrating it into the die of the new Apple A9 SoC processor. This saves space allowing for the reduction of the logic board size as well as reduced power usage within the phone. This chip is also at the heart of the first-generation iPhone SE. A variant of the Apple A9, the Apple A9X also incorporates the M9 processor on-die and drives the Apple iPad Pro.

====Apple Watch====
The Apple Watch extended step-counting capability to Apple&#x27;s first wearable device using the accelerometer and gyroscope integrated in the Apple S1 SIP (System in package). Apple Watch works in parallel with a connected iPhone to improve accuracy of the user&#x27;s step count.

===Fitbit===
The Fitbit is an always-on electronic pedometer, that in addition to counting steps also displays distance traveled, altitude climbed (via a number of flights of steps count), calories burned, current intensity, and time of day. Worn in an armband at night, it also purports to measure the length and quality of a user&#x27;s sleep. Inbuilt is a daily target, of 10,000 steps and 10 flights of stairs. Connected by USB with a computer, the user&#x27;s data is automatically uploaded and displayed via a web-based profile page, that keeps track of historical data, to which can be added food consumption data. Based on activity users are awarded badges for daily step and climbing targets, as well as &#x27;lifetime&#x27; awards for same. In the US and UK users can also download an iOS or Android app for recording and display of data. Most Fitbit devices estimate distance traveled based on steps counted, the intensity of the steps and the user&#x27;s profile data (specifically gender and height). Individuals can improve the accuracy of their stride length settings by measuring and calibrating their average stride length. Some higher-end Fitbit models include additional features such as heart rate monitoring and GPS tracking.

===Pedometers for Smartphones/MP3 players===
Since most smartphones, iPod Touches and some MP3 players are enhanced with an integrated accelerometer it is possible to introduce pedometer functionality to these devices. This option was successfully realized by a number of smartphone application developers, enabling any fitness-savvy smartphone owner to track the number of steps taken as well as distance travelled and calories used.

===NTT DoCoMo Fujitsu Pedometer Phone===
This is the first integrated phone with an always-on pedometer which counts steps like a traditional pedometer. The sensor is made by ADI. This handset was introduced in Japan in 2004 and has sold over 3 million units.

===Nokia products===

====Nokia 5500 Sports Phone====

The Nokia 5500 Sports Phone uses an embedded 3 axis MEMS inertial sensor to detect the steps a user takes. The pedometer application tracks steps taken, time elapsed and distance traveled. However the application cannot run continuously as it drains the phone&#x27;s battery and is therefore of limited use.

====Nokia Sports Tracker====
Nokia Sports Tracker features pedometer for Nokia Symbian phones with an Accelerometer. Accelerometers are included in phones to save correct orientation on photos and to improve the GPS positioning feature.

====Nokia Step Counter====
Nokia Step Counter is a free application available at Nokia Beta Labs which works on a wide range of N-Series Nokia phones. The pedometer application tracks steps taken, time elapsed and distance traveled. This application can be left running all day as it is not a huge drain on the battery.

===Sony Ericsson W710 Walkman phone, W580 Walkman phone===
The Sony Ericsson W710 and W580 Walkman phones use embedded 2 axis MEMS inertial sensors to detect the steps a user takes. The W710 is a clamshell phone and displays the user&#x27;s steps on the external display. The W710 must be closed in order for it to count steps. When the step counter is activated, it counts detected steps during the day, and at midnight it stores the counter in a day-by-day history and resets it to zero.

===Nintendo Consoles===
On November 1, 2008, Nintendo released the Nintendo DS title , which includes two pedometers. They connect to the game card via infrared signals.

On September 12, 2009, Nintendo released &quot;Pokémon HeartGold&quot; and &quot;SoulSilver&quot; in Japan. Each game comes bundled with a device called a Pokéwalker, which functions as a pedometer and allows players to transfer one Pokémon from their game to the Pokéwalker via infrared signals. Unlike the &quot;Personal Trainer: Walking&quot; pedometers, the Pokéwalker features a small LCD screen and multiple buttons. Walking with the Pokéwalker earns experience points for the Pokémon.

The Nintendo 3DS, released March 27, 2011, features an internal pedometer that counts and records daily step counts while in sleep mode. Every hundred steps earns a Play Coin, which can be spent on a variety of extras and bonuses. This pedometer is easily fooled, however, and &#x27;steps&#x27; can be created by simply lifting the device up and down in the hand with a motion similar to walking.

On October 31, 2013, Nintendo released Wii Fit U, which was able to interface with the Fit Meter, which was a pedometer with similar hardware to the Pokéwalker, but instead themed around Wii Fit U and with the ability to store and display the user&#x27;s Mii. It could be checked into the game via the infrared transceiver on top of the Wii U Gamepad, and could track the altitude of the player while walking.

===Philips Activa Workout Monitoring MP3 Player===
Released May 2010, by Philips. This MP3 capable pedometer measures aerobic intensity and matches songs on the playlist to keep the user engaged and motivated.

===Tractivity===
Tractivity is a group of health-related services that include a sensor that is worn on a shoe. The Tractivity sensor logs the distance a person walks or runs, the calories burned and the time the person was active, which they can then view on a private web page. Tractivity&#x27;s online web application provides a graphical experience and motivational resource to encourage people to lead healthier lifestyles. Tractivity accounts for the variation in a walker&#x27;s or runner&#x27;s stride length that occurs as pace changes. The sensors wirelessly transfer activity data to a secure server for viewing on an individual&#x27;s computer.

===Android===
Android integrates a step counter with version 4.4 (KitKat).

A device already supporting this sensor is the Nexus 5. Another smartphone is the Samsung Galaxy S5, which features a built-in pedometer that uses the S Health (later renamed to Samsung Health) software to display daily step counts, as well as other fitness information. Most Samsung devices now include this software bundled as standard.

<text>The General Electric TF39 is a high-bypass turbofan engine that was developed to power the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy. The TF39 was the first high-power, high-bypass jet engine developed. The TF39 was further developed into the CF6 series of engines, and formed the basis of the LM2500 and LM6000 marine and industrial gas turbine. On September 7, 2017, the last active C-5A powered with TF39 engines made its final flight to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base for retirement. The TF39 was effectively retired, and all remaining active C-5 Galaxies are Rebuilt C-5M Super Galaxies, powered by F138-GE-102 (derivative of General Electric CF6-80C2, specifically for C-5M upgrade) engines.

==Development==
The United States Air Force opened the &quot;CX-X Program&quot; in 1964, intending to produce a next-generation strategic airlifter. Of the several airframe and engine proposals returned for consideration, Lockheed&#x27;s aircraft and General Electric&#x27;s engine were selected for the new design in 1965.

The high-bypass turbofan was a huge leap in engine performance, offering a thrust of 43,000 pounds, while improving fuel efficiency by about 25%. The TF39 had an 8:1 bypass ratio, a 25:1 compressor pressure ratio, and a 2,500 °F (1,370 °C) turbine temperature made possible by advanced forced-air cooling. The first engine went for testing in 1965. Between 1968 and 1971, 463 TF39-1 and -1A engines were produced and delivered to power the C-5A fleet.

==Design==

The TF39 was a revolutionary 1960s engine rated from 41,000 to 43,000 lbf (191 to 205 kN) of thrust. It introduced use of a large by-pass ratio which, together with advances in core technology, contributed to a significant improvement in fuel efficiency over engines available at the time.

The engine included features developed from previous GE engines:
* Variable stator vanes (used in the J79/CJ805)
* Turbine cooling techniques (advanced from the J93 used in the XB-70)
* Cascade-type thrust reverser (from the CJ805)
* Snubbered first stage fan blades (snubbers, or mid-span shrouds, had been introduced by GE on the YJ93 first stage compressor blades)

The high-bypass ratio of 8:1 for the TF-39 had its origins in the lift-fan technology demonstrated by GE in the XV-5 Vertifan aircraft. This aircraft had two X353-5 engines, each consisting of a 62.5-inch-diameter lift-fan driven by a gas generator (J85). The bpr in VTOL operation was 12.3. This tip-turbine driven lift-fan concept was turned 90 degrees and developed as an 80-inch-diameter &quot;cruise fan&quot; demonstrator, driven by a J79 gas generator. For the CX-X program GE demonstrated a half-scale engine, the GE1/6, with 15,830 lb thrust and an sfc of 0.336. This was developed into the TF39 with a 97 in diameter fan.

By modern standards the Low Pressure Compressor on the TF-39 is fairly unique as a single T-stage is mounted upstream of the fan rotor, rather than behind it. Although this T-stage supercharges the inner section of the fan rotor, not all of this airstream enters the High Pressure Compressor as a fair proportion also enters the bypass duct to supplement the air discharging from the outer section of the fan. In other words there are three streams leaving the fan, two of which enter the bypass duct.

<text>Saint Francis of Assisi Parish Church, commonly known as Meycauayan Church or locally as , is a Roman Catholic church located in Meycauayan, Bulacan Philippines. It is one of the oldest parishes in Bulacan which even predates the Malolos Cathedral established in 1580 and the Barasoain Church established in 1859. It is also the province&#x27;s largest parish with an estimated population of about 80,000 parishioners. The church is the seat of the vicariate of St. Francis of Assisi in the Diocese of Malolos.

==History==

===Parish foundation===
The parish was founded in 1578 by Fr. Juan de Plasencia and Fr. Diego de Oropeza, the first batch of Franciscan priests to reach the Philippines in 1577. They built a small church made of nipa thatch and bamboo in a small area called &quot;Sitio Torril&quot;, which is now part of Brgy. Bahay Pare in Meycauayan. The church was blown by a typhoon in 1588.

The Franciscans also brought a wooden missionary cross when they arrived in Meycauayan, similar to Magellan&#x27;s Cross. The cross was later found to be in the possession of a resident of Brgy. Bahay Pare. [The cross, now known as The Cross of Sitio Torril, is probably the oldest known religious relic in Meycauayan. Every October 4 during the feast day of the town&#x27;s patron saint, Saint Francis of Assisi, this cross is brought from Brgy. Bahay Pare to the parish church for public veneration.]

===Transfer to the second site===
A request was made to build a stone church, and on November 16, 1588, Dr. Santiago de Vera, made justified by such request, instantly dispatch Secretary Gaspar de Azebo to Christoval de Asquera, Mayor of the Province of Meycauayan. By the order of St. Pedro Bautista, it was transferred to a place called Lagolo, by R. P. Fr. Antonio de Nombela, Minister of the town. In 1589, by the decree of the &quot;Superior Govierno&quot;, a church made up mainly of adobe (volcanic tuff) was built. The said church was the place of worship of Meycaueños until 1668.

===Present location===
The church was transferred to its site in the present &quot;poblacion&quot; (town center) due to the attacks of the native Aetas. In 1668, Fray Nicolas Santiago started the construction of the stone church that measured &quot;sixty yards long by wide twelve and a half wide&quot; ( The church also served as one of the prototypes of city planning in accordance to the Spanish government&#x27;s reduccion policy; Meycauayan was among the first towns in the colony that has the parish church and the city or municipal hall adjacent to each other, if not housed within the same vicinity. The construction of the present convent was started in 1731 by Fr. Juan Francisco de San Antonio. It was continued by Fray Miguel de San Bernardo and was completed in 1739 under the administration of Fray Jose Sellez. It was described as the best convent among the Franciscan Province of St. Gregory the Great. In 1784, the wooden portions of the church were replaced with hewn-stones by Fray Jose Cantos.

In 1800, the bell tower was constructed by order of Fr. Francisco Gascueña, OFM. The said tower is one of the two of its kind in the Philippines with a large arch bridge connecting the church and the tower. The tower belfry housed five bells named &quot;Maria Concepcion&quot;, the biggest, which was made by order of Fr. Antonio de Guadalajara in 1878; the &quot;San Francisco&quot;, dedicated to the town&#x27;s patron saint made by the order of Fr. Juan Fernandez in 1881; &quot;San Jose&quot;, the smallest made by the order of Fr. Francisco Gascuena; and two others.

As a result of a furious typhoon, the entire town got flooded in 1802, causing much damages that the value of a sack of rice reached four pesos with four &quot;reales&quot; the following year. After this crisis, Fr. Gascueña managed to construct the narthex (an arch made of stone sustaining the choir) in 1804. Through the span of thirty-one years, Fr. Gascueña has showed all the kind virtues and charity to the poor, to whom he never denied alms whether they may be their parishioner or from other towns. He died in Meycauayan on November 18, 1831, and was buried beneath the main altar of the church.

Under the direction of Rev. Fr. Balbino de Consuerga, all wooden parts were renovated in 1832. The sacristy was constructed and over it, a spacious hall was added followed by other useful improvements year after year until 1850 when Fr. Benito de Madridejos took over the church and carried the work of his predecessor the best way possible. In 1851, Fr. Benito conducted repairs on several damages inside the church and commissioned a new main altarpiece. In 1853, the convent underwent repairs on which several parts were converted as the Parochial School.

A cemetery gate was constructed in 1880. The church-convent complex was seriously damaged by a strong typhoon in 1882.

===Secularization===

The first native clergyman to be assigned as parish priest in Meycauayan was Fr. Esteban Daez, a native of Polo, Obando, Bulacan. He was a coadjutor priest in 1892 before he became the &quot;cura parroco interino&quot; (interim parish priest) from 1898 to 1900.

=== American occupation ===
Both the Meycauayan Church and convent were occupied and became the temporary headquarters of the American soldiers in May 1899 after it was captured from the Filipinos revolutionaries during the Philippine–American War. Some of the church possessions were believed destroyed or looted during their stay in the church complex. Following its return to the Catholic Church in 1903, a claim was filed by the Catholic Church in the Philippines to be paid by the United States of America regarding the church properties occupied, damaged or otherwise destroyed by American troops from 1899 to 1903 that amounted to 2,200 pesos with a monthly rental of 50 pesos for the convent-turned-to-headquarters.

=== Post-war ===
During World War II, the church survived destruction unlike the churches in Manila. In 1946, then future President Diosdado Macapagal and former Dr. Evangelina Macaraeg were wed at the church in 1946.

The church was destroyed by a massive fire in 1949, known as the &quot;Great Fire of Meycauayan&quot;. Artifacts such as old memorabilia, statues, church vestments, records, ciboriums and chalices are some of the casualties of the fire. The &quot;retablo&quot; in the spanish colonial style was destroyed. Only a few church items including the tabernacle were saved from the fire. It was saved from destruction by Fr. Jorge Capistrano (currently on display at the parish museum). After its destruction, a committee was formed for the reconstruction of the present church by the priests together with Anselmo de Leon as its head, which campaigned for donations and help from the people for the church&#x27;s restoration.

In 1984 one year after Former Senator Ninoy Aquino&#x27;s assassination, the church became the refuge of political activist when the marchers commemorating the anniversary of Ninoy&#x27;s untimely death in a political march called &quot;Tarlac-to-Tarmac&quot; were prevented from entering Metro Manila by the Philippine military with a barricade on MacArthur Highway, between Meycauayan and Valenzuela towns. Support for the marchers snowballed from the residents of Meycauayan and the nearby towns, and the marchers were given an invitation to stay in the Church during the standoff. With the outpouring of support for the marchers, the former strongman President Marcos finally allowed the marchers to proceed to Manila International Airport, the final destination of the march after a day of waiting. In hindsight, it was a small victory for the Filipinos from the former dictator, a precursor of the People Power Revolution.

The church recently had its interior walls restored and its sanctuary renovated recreating the neoclassic altarpiece of Fr. Benito Madridejos under the term of Rev. Msgr. Adalberto G. Vergara, P.C. The church and its altar was solemnly dedicated by Dennis C. Villarojo, D.D., Bishop of Malolos on November 30, 2020.

===Meycauayan bells===
The Meycauayan bells are hand bells from the Saint Francis Church that was lost during the Philippine–American War. The altar bell are two bells connected by a hard block of dark wood with a handle on top. It is approximately long and about wide. The bells were believed taken as war booty from the Mercauayan Church, after it was captured and headquartered by the Americans. A paper note with inscription is attached to the wooden block of the bells that reads: “Taken from the Church at MEYCAUAYAN, Luczon (sic) Islands after bombardment by Utah Battery March 29, 1899. By P.O. Thomas, Co. A Battalion of Engineers.”

The bells were found by archivist Monte Kniffen of the Sisters of Mercy in Omaha, Nebraska in July 2011 among a set of properties that were originally in the possession of their convent in Red Bluff, California. It was not known who gave the bells to the said convent, but Kniffen said that perhaps a small museum or a family could have turned it over to the convent after noting that they were church bells.

On October 8, 2011, the Consul General to Chicago, Leo M. Herrera-Lim, and his wife traveled to Omaha to formally receive the artifact from Sister Judith Frikker, President of the Sisters of Mercy West Midwest Community. Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert Del Rosario turned over the Philippine–American War artifact to Director Jeremy Barns of the National Museum of the Philippines on March 9, 2012. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Malolos received the bells on August 6, 2012, and became part of the Diocesan Museum.

<doc id="680826" wikidata="Q2072926" url="?curid=680826" title="Bruce Fraser, 1st Baron Fraser of North Cape">
<text>Admiral of the Fleet Bruce Austin Fraser, 1st Baron Fraser of North Cape, (5 February 1888 – 12 February 1981) was a senior Royal Navy officer. He served in the First World War, saw action during the Gallipoli Campaign and took part in the internment of the German High Seas Fleet at the end of the war. He also served in the Second World War initially as Third Sea Lord and Controller of the Navy and then as second-in-command and afterwards as commander of the Home Fleet, leading the force that destroyed the . He went on to be First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff in which role he assisted in establishing NATO and agreed to the principle that the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic should be an American admiral, in the face of fierce British opposition.

==Early naval career==
Born the son of General Alexander Fraser and Monica Stores Fraser (née Smith), Fraser was educated at Bradfield College. He joined the Royal Navy as a cadet in the training ship HMS &quot;Britannia&quot; in September 1902 and passed out as a midshipman in the battleship in the Channel Fleet on 15 January 1904. He transferred to the battleship in the Channel Fleet in February 1905 and, having been promoted to sub-lieutenant on 15 March 1907, he joined the battleship in May 1907. He moved to the destroyer HMS &quot;Gypsy&quot; in September 1907 and, having been promoted to lieutenant on 15 March 1908, he joined the cruiser in the Mediterranean Fleet.

Fraser transferred to the Home Fleet in August 1910 and remained there serving in until July 1911 when he joined , the Royal Navy&#x27;s school of Gunnery at Whale Island in Portsmouth harbour where he commenced the &#x27;long course&#x27; to qualify as a specialist Gunnery Officer. He assisted on the Advanced Gunnery Course at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, in 1912 and then joined the instructing staff at HMS &quot;Excellent&quot; in 1913.

Fraser served in the First World War, initially in the cruiser providing naval gunfire support during the Gallipoli Campaign and then carrying troops to protect Egypt&#x27;s Western frontier. He returned to HMS &quot;Excellent&quot; early in 1916 and, having been promoted to lieutenant commander on 15 March 1916, he joined the battleship as Gunnery Officer at the end of the year. He spent the remainder of the War with the Grand Fleet and took part in the internment of the German High Seas Fleet in November 1918.
After the war and following his promotion to commander on 30 June 1919 and his appointment as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire on 17 July 1919, Fraser volunteered to serve with the White Russian Caspian Flotilla; however on arrival in Azerbaijan as part of the 1920 Royal Navy Mission to Enzeli, he was captured and imprisoned by Bolsheviks in the Black Hole of Baku until released in November 1920. He then returned to HMS &quot;Excellent&quot; before joining the Naval Ordnance Department at the Admiralty in June 1922. He became Fleet Gunnery Officer for the Mediterranean Fleet in December 1924 and, having been promoted to captain on 30 June 1926, he became Head of the Tactical Division of the Admiralty in January 1927. He was appointed to command the cruiser on the East Indies Station in September 1929 and then became Director of the Naval Ordnance Department at the Admiralty in July 1933.

Fraser returned to sea to take command of the aircraft carrier in May 1936 and then became Chief Staff Officer to the Flag Officer Aircraft Carriers in 1937. He reached Flag rank as a rear admiral on 11 January 1938 and was made chief of staff to the commander-in-chief Mediterranean Fleet in April 1938. He was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1939 New Year Honours.

==Second World War==
In March 1939, shortly before the outset of the Second World War, Fraser was appointed Third Sea Lord and Controller of the Navy. Promoted to vice admiral on 8 May 1940, he was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1941 Birthday Honours and became second-in-command, Home Fleet and Flag Officer, 2nd Battle Squadron, in June 1942. He was appointed a Grand Officer of the Dutch Order of Orange-Nassau on 19 January 1943.
Fraser was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet in May 1943 and appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1943 Birthday Honours. In the role of Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet, he commanded the Royal Navy force that destroyed the German battleship &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; at the Battle of the North Cape on 26 December 1943. Units of the Home Fleet regularly escorted convoys to Murmansk in the Soviet Union: Fraser was convinced that &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; would attempt an attack on Convoy JW 55B, and put to sea in his flagship to reach a position between the convoy and the German battleship&#x27;s base in North Norway. &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; had her fighting ability destroyed by repeated hits from &quot;Duke of York&quot; and her speed reduced by a 14-inch shell hit to a boiler room, which deprived her of the ability to escape. She was then hit by an initial wave of four torpedoes and, after concentrated gunfire and further torpedo attacks, sank at 7.45 pm that night. Thus Fraser avenged the destruction of his old command, HMS &quot;Glorious&quot;, by &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; three years earlier. After the action Fraser and his fleet returned to Murmansk for refuelling.

For this action he was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 5 January 1944, and awarded the Russian Order of Suvorov, First Degree on 25 February.

Promoted to full admiral on 7 February 1944, Fraser took command of the Eastern Fleet in August 1944 and then of the British Pacific Fleet in December 1944. He commanded from ashore at his Headquarters in Sydney in Australia and built a strong relationship with the United States Navy, adopting their system of signal communications. Fraser was the British signatory to the Japanese Instrument of Surrender at Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945.

==Later career==
On 27 April 1946 Fraser was appointed First and Principal Naval Aide-de-Camp to the King and, in September, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Fraser of North Cape, of Molesey in the County of Surrey. He became Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth in September 1947 and First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff in September 1948, and was promoted to the rank of Admiral of the Fleet on 22 October. As First Sea Lord he assisted in establishing NATO and agreed to the principle that the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT) should be an American admiral, in the face of fierce British opposition. He retired in December 1951 and died, unmarried, in London on 12 February 1981, one week after his birthday at the age of 93, upon which the barony became extinct.

<text>The Cohocton River, sometimes referred to as the Conhocton River, is a tributary of the Chemung River in western New York in the United States. Via the Chemung River, it is part of the Susquehanna River watershed, flowing to Chesapeake Bay. The name &quot;Cohocton&quot; is derived from an Iroquois term, &quot;Ga-ha-to&quot;, meaning &quot;log floating in the water&quot; or &quot;trees in the water&quot;.

New York State Route 17 follows the valley of the river along much of its route through Steuben County. The river is a popular destination for fly fishing.

==History==
In the 1820s the New York State Legislature commissioned a study for the building of a canal that would link the Cohocton at Bath to Keuka Lake (Crooked Lake) and Seneca Lake. The Crooked Lake Canal connecting the two lakes was built, but the link to the Cohocton was never completed.

==Course and watershed==
The Cohocton River rises in southeastern Livingston County, approximately northeast of Dansville in Tabor Corners. It flows generally southeast through rural Steuben County, in a winding course through a valley of the Allegheny Plateau, past Cohocton, Avoca and Bath. At Painted Post, just west of Corning, it is joined by the Tioga River from the southwest to form the Chemung, a tributary of the Susquehanna River.

The watershed of the Cohocton River is largely undeveloped, with 61.9 percent being forested, 35.8 percent in agriculture, and only 1.5 percent urban.

<text>The Gehn is a small ridge of hills between Bramsche and Ueffeln in Germany&#x27;s Central Uplands, that are an extension of the Wiehen Hills ().
The ridge runs from northwest to southeast and is about long and an average of wide. The highest point is the Kettelberg which is high. The Gehn forms a link between the &quot;Wiehen Hills&quot; and the Ankum Heights (&quot;Ankumer Höhe&quot;). It is largely forested and is not - like the Ankum Heights- part of a series of ice age terminal moraines from the latest event of the Saalian glaciation, the so-called Drenthe I stage, but is a ridge of Jurassic rock that was pushed up during the folding towards the end of the Cretaceous period.

Like the Wiehen Hills and the Ankum Heights, the Gehn belongs to the North Teutoburg Forest-Wiehen Hills Nature Park (&quot;Naturpark Nördlicher Teutoburger Wald-Wiehengebirge&quot;).

== Elevations ==
Amongst the main elevations on the Gehn are the:

<text>Shivneri Fort (&quot;known as Killa&quot;) (Marathi pronunciation: ) is an ancient military fortification located near Junnar in Pune district in Maharashtra, India. It is the birthplace of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the founder of Maratha Kingdom.

==History==
Shivneri got its name as it was under the possession of the Yadavas of Devagiri. This fort was mainly used to guard the old trading route from Desh to the port city of Kalyan. The place passed on to the Bahmani Sultanate after the weakening of Delhi Sultanate during the 15th century and it then passed on to the Ahmadnagar Sultanate in the 16th century. In 1595, a Maratha chief named Maloji Bhosale, the grandfather of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, was ennobled by the Ahmadnagar Sultan, Bahadur Nizam Shah and he gave him Shivneri and Chakan. Shivaji maharaj was born at the fort on 19 February 1630, and spent his childhood there. Inside the fort is a small temple dedicated to goddess Shivai Devi (some accounts gives us information that name shivaji came from the name of the fort i.e. Shivneri), after whom Shivaji was named. The English traveller Fraze visited the fort in 1673 and found it invincible. According to his accounts, the fort was well-stocked to feed thousand families for seven years. The fort came under the control of the British rule in 1819 after the Third Anglo-Maratha War.

In 2021, it was added to the tentative list of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee as part of &quot;Serial Nomination of Maratha Military Architecture in Maharashtra&quot;.

==Architecture==
Shivneri Fort is a hill fort having a triangular shape and has its entrance from the South-west side of the hill. Apart from the main gate there is an entrance to the fort from side called locally as &quot;the chain gate&quot;, where in one has to hold chains to climb up to the fort gate. The fort extends up to with seven spiral well-defended gates. There are mud walls all around the fort. Inside the fort, the major buildings are the prayer hall, a tomb and a mosque. There is an overhanging where executions took place. There are many gates structures protecting this fort. Maha Darvaja is one of the many gates of the fort. Its also called the origin of Tune.

At the centre of the fort is a water pond which is called &#x27;Badami Talav&#x27;, and to the south of this pond are statues of Rajmata Jijabai and a young Shivaji raje. In the fort there are two water springs, called Ganga and Yamuna, which have water throughout the year. Two kilometers away from this fort there are the Buddhist rock-cut caves, called Lenyadri caves, which is also one of Ashtavinayak temple in Maharashtra. It has been declared as a protected monument.

==Access==
The nearest town Junnar is a taluka place and is well connected by road. Junnar is about 90 km from Pune. The fort is at about 2–3 km from the junnar town. It is easy to reach the fort top via main entrance; however, the trekkers with proper climbing equipment can try the chain route which is located on the western scarp of the fort. From the top of the fort, Narayangad, Hadsar, Chavand and Nimgiri forts can easily be seen.

<doc id="680838" wikidata="Q203278" url="?curid=680838" title="Millau">
<text>Millau (; ) is a commune in Occitania, France. Located at the confluence of the Tarn and Dourbie rivers, the town is a subprefecture of the Aveyron department.

Millau is known for its Viaduct, glove industry and several nearby natural landmarks such as the Gorges du Tarn. The surrounding Causses are renowned for their pastoral traditions and cheese production, including Roquefort. In this regard, the region has been part of the Causses and Cévennes World Heritage Site since 2011.

== History ==

The town dates back nearly 3000 years when it was situated on the Granède hills which dominate the town. In the second or first century B.C, it would move to the alluvial plain on the left bank of the Tarn. The plain gave the town its Gallic name of Condatomagus (Contado meaning &quot;confluence&quot; and magus for the &quot;market&quot;). The site of Condatomagus was identified in the 19th century by Dieudonné Rey; it was close to the major earthenware centre in the Roman Empire, La Graufesenque. This is where luxury ceramics such as red terra sigillata were made. Despite major new developments in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, the centre of the old Roman and medieval town on the opposite (left) bank of the Tarn remains poorly excavated, and the newly renovated &quot;Maison du Peuple&quot;, almost on the site of the old Roman forum, saw no archaeological dig prior to the excavation of the new, very deep, foundations. The local museum sits almost adjacent to this site.

By the second century A.D. trade had collapsed from competition, and subsequent barbarian invasions during the fourth and fifth centuries saw the town relocate to the opposite bank, changing its name to Amiliavum, then to Milhau en Rouergat (in the Millhau language), then to the French Millhau.

By the ninth century the town had grown. It a seat of viguerie, a mediaeval administrative court, and a centre for the production of lambskin gloves. Ramparts surrounded the town. The tenth and eleventh centuries saw the creation of the Viscount of Millau and subsequently passed to the Counts of Provence, the Counts of Barcelona and eventually, in 1112, to the father of the future King of Aragon, Béranger III following his marriage to the daughter of the Viscount of Millau. In 1187, the King of Aragon grants him the seal and communal freedom of Provence by Consular Charter. A consulate was thus created, and was responsible for administering the city to raise taxes and to apply justice. In 1271, Millau passed to the crown of the kings of France.

In 1361, during the Hundred Years War, the city came under English rule. The return to peace in the fifteenth century gave the city an economic boost. Louis XI connected Millau to the crown in 1476 by letters patent. At this time, the town was part of the former province of Rouergue where local people spoke Rouergat, a dialect of the Occitan language. 

In the Middle Ages the town had one of the main mediaeval bridges across the Tarn river. It had 17 arches, but after one poorly-maintained arch collapsed in the 18th century, the bridge was mostly demolished. Only one arch remains, with a mill that is now an art gallery, as testament to this significant trading route from north to south across pre-Renaissance France.

The 19th century saw the development of the glove industry. Major urban development works were carried out during the Second Empire at the instigation of banker Achille Villa, mayor from 1855 to 1865. In the first half of the 20th century, more than half of the town&#x27;s inhabitants made their living from the leather industry. Millau was affected rather late by the Great Depression. In 1934, the Villa bank went bankrupt. The town was then paralysed by a six-month general strike in the winter of 1934-1935, following a 25-30% cut in workers&#x27; wages. But the glove industry remained resilient, before starting its decline in the 1960s.

The town gained national notoriety in the 1970s as part of the Larzac struggle. In 1999, local anti-globalisation activists destroyed the building site of a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant. They were protesting against the US overtax on the import of Roquefort, in retaliation for the European Union refusing the import of US hormone-treated meat. It was also an opportunity to condemn fast food, Americanization, and the spread of GMO. The McDonald&#x27;s was quickly completed and José Bové, one of the leaders of the dismantling operation, was sentenced to a short prison term.

The Millau Viaduct opened in 2004, eliminating traffic jams from the town centre.

=== Heraldry ===
The traditional arms of the city of Millau are &quot;Gold with four pallets gules, a chief azure three gold fleurs-de-lis.&quot;

This has been the arms of the Crown of Aragon since 1187, but since 1271 surmounted with the leader of France (Azure three fleurs de lys) indicating that this is a bonne ville (good town), i.e. a commune reporting directly to the king. The city itself was administered through elected consuls – like Toulouse and its sheriffs – while the king was the sole and direct lord. Few cities in France enjoyed such an autonomous regime.

== Geography ==
The territory of this town lies across a southern portion of the Massif Central. It covers a large area of some , which makes it the 25th largest metropolitan town in France. The municipality lies at the heart of the Grands Causses, a part of the Causse Rouge (east of the plateau Lévézou), and part of Larzac as well as part of the Black Causse. The city county seat is located in the lower part of the town, in a large depression at the confluence of the Tarn and Dourbie, at an altitude of about 340 m.

The territory surrounding the town of Millau is characterized by livestock production and the maintaining of natural grasslands, fields and temporary pastures. A multitude of gorges, ravines and defiles give the landscape its character. These predominantly agricultural rural areas like the rest of this fragile region, are protected by the Regional Natural Park of Grands Causses.

The area&#x27;s flora consists of over 2000 species. There is a triple-leaved asparagus, Montpellier aphyllanthe, honeysuckle from the Etruria region of Italy. During the summer, the highest land of the municipality does not retain rain water and becomes arid. Some game in the area is protected and regulated by the hunting missions which gather quails, Hobby falcon, hawks, lizards, deer, wild boars, deer and mountain sheep.

The expansion of the bed of the river Tarn in the city and the creation of a raw discharge linked to its expansion has slowed and lowered the level of the river that now sees the proliferation of aquatic buttercup which is reveling in the stagnant water. This has also led to a decline in wild populations of brown trout in this sector. Also waterproofing concrete and paving large areas has increased significantly water from rain discharged directly to the river inducing a phenomenon called &quot;flush&quot; that is quite destructive to aquatic fauna and the banks.

=== Climate ===
There are three distinct climatic effects felt in the region. In spring and autumn, the westerly winds and southwest produce an oceanic climate. In summer, winds from the southeast predominate and the weather is more Mediterranean, but these winds can also disrupt the normal course of the season at any time of the year. In winter, northern winds submit this country to the rigors of continental climate.

== Administration ==
Millau is a sub-prefecture of the Aveyron department in Occitania.

The &#x27;Community of Communes of Millau Grands Causses&#x27; was created on 22 June 1989. It was a federation of 5 municipalities, namely Aguessac, Compeyre, Creissels, Millau and Paulhe. Nowadays, the community consists of 15 communes with the addition of Comprégnac, Saint-Georges-de-Luzençon, La Roque-Sainte-Marguerite, Saint-André-de-Vézines, Mostuéjouls, Peyreleau, Rivière-sur-Tarn and Veyreau.

== Tourism ==

The town is now a tourist destination with one of the largest campsites in the Massif Central, benefiting from the attractive surrounding landscapes and its architecturally-acclaimed Viaduct. It is also a major centre for outdoor sports, especially paragliding. Millau hosts a variety of competitions every year.

=== Sporting events ===
* 100 kilometers of Millau (Running)
* Terre des Cardabelles Rally
* Templars Festival (Trail)
* Natural Games Festival (Outdoor Sports and Music) 
* Viaduct Half-Marathon

=== Historical buildings ===
There are 11 listed historical monuments in Millau :
* The archaeological site of La Graufesenque, i.e. the remains of a major Gallo-Roman center for ceramics production.
* Notre-Dame de l&#x27;Espinasse, built in the twelfth century. This church takes its name from a relic of the crown of thorns once kept in his treasure. Destroyed in the sixteenth century, it was rebuilt a century later. Its bell tower is Toulouse style.
* The Belfry of Millau, which is composed of two parts corresponding to two different eras. The square tower was built in the twelfth century on the site of the original castle of the Counts of Millau. It assured the safety of the fortifications in the southwest corner. At the beginning of the 17th century, the consuls of Millau built an octagonal tower above it. The square tower was used as a prison from the 17th to the 19th century. The building was burned by lightning on 29 July 1811 and then rebuilt.
* The washhouse of the Ayrolle. The roof dates from the 18th century.
* The Old Mill and Old Bridge on the River Tarn.
* Sambucy de Sorgues Hôtel, also called Sambucy castle, and its gardens. It was built between 1672 and 1674 by Jacques Duchesne, Advisor to the King, local Master of Waters and Forests. After his marriage, the Hôtel became the property of Marc Antoine de Sambucy, capitoul of Toulouse.
* Sambucy de Miers Hôtel, acquired in the 17th century by the Sambucy family.
* Les Halles, a market hall built during the Belle Époque.
* La Rue Droite, the central Roman road.
* Pégayrolles Hôtel built in 1738, which now hosts the town&#x27;s Museum. This Museum houses rich collections of pottery, tannery and gloves.
* The neo-Byzantine Sacré-Coeur church dating from the 19th century.

== Education ==
The schools of Millau fall under the authority of the academic administration in Toulouse. Vocational education can be found at the 2iSA (South Aveyron Computer Institute). Higher education courses are offered by the Institute of Nursing Training (IFSI), Jean Vigo High School (BTS), and the Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers (CNAM).

== Transport ==

The Millau Viaduct, tallest cable-stayed road bridge in the world, which carries the A75 autoroute across the Tarn valley, relieved the town of much of its traffic, particularly during the summer months.

The municipality operates the airfield of Millau-Larzac. 

== Economy ==
The town is the seat of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in South Aveyron.

Having been recognized for over a century as the &quot;capital of leather and glove&quot;, Millau is renowned for its tannery and sheepskin gloves. Although industrial fabric has all but disappeared, a few workshops continue to manufacture gloves for major French fashion and luxury brands. Millau gained the title of &quot;City and Art Professions&quot; in 2000.

Farming production, including Roquefort cheese made from raw sheep&#x27;s milk, is essential to the economic activity of the region. Since 1993, a serie of four major night markets organized by farmer-producers take place from July to August in the city center. In November, the autumn fair of farm products is organized by the same association of farmers and runs for two days.

== In fiction ==
Part of Ian McEwan&#x27;s award-winning novel &quot;Atonement&quot; (2001) centers on Briony Tallis, a nurse in a London hospital in June 1940, to which wounded British and French soldiers evacuated from Dunkirk were brought. In a poignant passage, she is comforting Luc Cornet, a young soldier from Millau who is dying of severe head wounds. In his delirium he talks of the town, of his family and his father&#x27;s boulangerie where he worked, and mistakes Tallis for his own fiancée.

After he dies, Tallis for a moment imagines the life she might have had if Luc had survived and if she had married him and come to live with him in Millau: 

The Millau countryside also played an important part in the French film &quot;Total Western&quot;, by Eric Rochant.

<text>Sela Ann Ward (born July 11, 1956) is an American actress. Her breakthrough TV role was as Teddy Reed in the NBC drama series &quot;Sisters&quot; (1991–1996), for which she received her first Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 1994. She received her second Primetime Emmy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama for the leading role of Lily Manning in the ABC drama series &quot;Once and Again&quot; (1999–2002). Ward later had the recurring role of Stacy Warner in the Fox medical drama &quot;House&quot;, also starred as Jo Danville in the CBS police procedural &quot;&quot; (2010–2013) and starred as Dana Mosier in the CBS police procedural series &quot;FBI&quot; (2018–2019).

She also played supporting roles in films, including &quot;The Man Who Loved Women&quot; (1983), &quot;Rustlers&#x27; Rhapsody&quot; (1985), &quot;Nothing in Common&quot; (1986), &quot;Hello Again&quot; (1987), &quot;The Fugitive&quot; (1993), &quot;My Fellow Americans&quot; (1996), &quot;The Badge&quot; (2002), &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; (2004), &quot;The Guardian&quot; (2006), &quot;The Stepfather&quot; (2009), &quot;Gone Girl&quot; (2014), and &quot;Independence Day: Resurgence&quot; (2016).

==Early life==
Ward was born in Meridian, Mississippi, to Annie Kate (née Boswell), a homemaker, and Granberry Holland &quot;G.H.&quot; Ward, Jr., an electrical engineer. Her father is a native of Meridian while her mother was born in Choctaw County, Alabama, before moving to Meridian as a child. Ward is the eldest of four children with a sister, Jenna, and two brothers, Joseph Brock and Granberry Holland Ward III. She graduated from Lamar School in Meridian.

Ward attended the University of Alabama, where she was Homecoming Queen, a Crimson Tide cheerleader, and joined Chi Omega sorority. She double-majored in fine art and advertising. She graduated in 1977.

==Career==

While working in New York City as a storyboard artist for multimedia presentations, Ward began modeling to supplement her income. She was recruited by the Wilhelmina agency and was soon featured in television commercials promoting Maybelline cosmetics.

Ward eventually moved to California to pursue acting and landed her first film role in the 1983 Burt Reynolds vehicle &quot;The Man Who Loved Women&quot;. Her first regular role in a television drama series, as a socialite on Dennis Weaver&#x27;s short-lived CBS series, &quot;Emerald Point N.A.S.,&quot; followed in the same year. Ward continued to land guest roles in both television and films throughout the 1980s, most notably opposite Tom Hanks in 1986&#x27;s &quot;Nothing in Common&quot;. In 1991 she was cast as the bohemian alcoholic Teddy Reed on &quot;Sisters,&quot; for which she received her first Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 1994. She portrayed Helen Kimble, the wife of Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford), in &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, one of the top films of 1993.

Ward won a CableACE Award for her portrayal of the late television journalist Jessica Savitch in the 1995 TV film &quot;Almost Golden: The Jessica Savitch Story.&quot; &quot;Almost Golden&quot; remains Lifetime&#x27;s most watched TV film to date.

In 1995, Ward was passed over for a Bond girl role for the 1995 movie GoldenEye, learning that even though then-Bond Pierce Brosnan was 42, the casting director said &quot;What we really want is Sela, but Sela ten years ago&quot;. In response, she developed and produced a documentary, &quot;The Changing Face of Beauty&quot;, about American obsession with youth and its effect on women. Later on, Ward would voice the part of former model turned villain Page Monroe in an episode (&quot;Mean Seasons&quot;) of &quot;The New Batman/Superman Adventures&quot;, which focused primarily on the media&#x27;s obsession with youth.

Ward succeeded Candice Bergen as commercial spokesperson for Sprint&#x27;s long distance telephone service from 1999 until 2002. She also appeared on &quot;Frasier&quot; as supermodel/zoologist Kelly Easterbrook in the fifth season opener (&quot;Frasier&#x27;s Imaginary Friend&quot;). When she read for the role of Lily Brooks Manning on the series &quot;Once and Again&quot;, its creators (Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz of &quot;thirtysomething&quot; fame) initially deemed Ward &quot;too beautiful&quot; for the average single mother to identify with. Ward received her second lead actress Emmy and a Golden Globe Award.

In 2004, she played the role of a private investigator in the television film &quot;Suburban Madness.&quot; The same year, she also appeared in the film &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; with Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal. In 2005, she began a recurring role in the Fox dramatic series &quot;House&quot; as Stacy Warner, the hospital&#x27;s attorney and formidable ex-partner of the protagonist Dr. Gregory House (played by Hugh Laurie). In 2006, Ward&#x27;s character was written off the show. However, she made her last guest appearance in the series finale (which aired on May 21, 2012).

Ward was originally offered both the role of Megan Donner on &quot;&quot; and Susan Mayer on &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, but turned both down. Ward was reluctant to commit to another lead role in an hour-long series because of the time away from her family it would require.

Although she was on a brief hiatus from television, she continued to appear in feature films. She starred opposite Kevin Costner in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2006 and starred in the thriller &quot;The Stepfather&quot; in 2009. In July 2010, Ward signed on to star in the police drama &quot;&quot;, at the &#x27;s start. Ward remained on the show until the ninth and final season&#x27;s end in February 2013.

Ward appeared as newswoman Sharon Schieber in &quot;Gone Girl&quot; (2014), and co-starred in &quot;Independence Day: Resurgence&quot;, released June 2016, in which she played the President of the United States, President Lanford. She also played the leading role alongside Nick Nolte in the political comedy series &quot;Graves&quot;. She was in a leading role alongside Missy Peregrym, Zeeko Zaki and Jeremy Sisto in the crime series &quot;FBI&quot;.

== Personal life ==
On May 23, 1992, Ward married entrepreneur Howard Elliott Sherman. They have two children: Austin and Anabella.

After meeting two foster children during a holiday trip home to Mississippi in 1997, Ward decided to meet a broader need for abused and neglected children by initiating and partially funding the creation of a permanent group home and emergency shelter, as well as transition houses. Hope Village for Children opened in Ward&#x27;s hometown of Meridian in January 2002, housed on a property once used as a Masonic-owned and operated orphanage, and is intended to serve as a pilot for a nationwide network of similar shelters. Hope Village had a capacity of 44 residents and served an average of 300 children per year .

In 2002, Ward published her autobiography, &quot;Homesick: A Memoir&quot;, through HarperCollins&#x27; ReganBooks imprint. In 2014, Ward was a part of her first group art exhibition at KM Fine Arts.

<doc id="680859" wikidata="Q1030785" url="?curid=680859" title="Demodicosis">
<text>Demodicosis , also called Demodex folliculitis in humans and demodectic mange () or red mange in animals, is caused by a sensitivity to and overpopulation of &quot;Demodex&quot; as the host&#x27;s immune system is unable to keep the mites under control.

&quot;Demodex&quot; is a genus of mite in the family Demodecidae. The mites are specific to their hosts, and each mammal species is host to one or two unique species of &quot;Demodex&quot; mites. Therefore, demodicosis cannot be transferred across species and has no zoonotic potential.

==Signs and symptoms==
===Humans===
Demodicosis in humans is usually caused by &quot;Demodex folliculorum&quot; and may have a rosacea-like appearance. Common symptoms include hair loss, itching, and inflammation. An association with pityriasis folliculorum has also been described.

Demodicosis is most often seen in folliculitis (inflammation of the hair follicles of the skin). Depending on the location, it may result in small pustules (pimples) at the base of a hair shaft on inflamed, congested skin. Demodicosis may also cause itching, swelling, and erythema of the eyelid margins. Scales at the base of the eyelashes may develop. Typically, patients complain of eyestrain.

===Dogs===

Minor cases of demodectic mange usually do not cause much itching but might cause pustules, redness, scaling, leathery skin, hair loss, skin that is warm to the touch, or any combination of these. It most commonly appears first on the face, around the eyes, or at the corners of the mouth, and on the forelimbs and paws. It may be misdiagnosed as a &quot;hot spot&quot; or other skin ailment.

In the more severe form, hair loss can occur in patches all over the body and might be accompanied by crusting, pain, enlarged lymph nodes, and deep skin infections.

Typically, animals become infected through nursing from their mother. The transmission of these mites from mother to pup is &quot;normal&quot; (which is why the mites are normal inhabitants of the dog&#x27;s skin), but some individuals are sensitive to the mites due to a cellular immune deficiency, underlying disease, stress, or malnutrition, which can lead to the development of clinical demodectic mange.

Some breeds appear to have an increased risk of mild cases as young dogs, including the Afghan Hound, American Staffordshire Terrier, Boston Terrier, Boxer, Chihuahua, Chow Chow, Shar-Pei, Collie, Dalmatian, Doberman Pinscher, Bulldog, French Bulldog, English Bull Terrier, Miniature Bull Terrier, German Shepherd, Great Dane, Old English Sheepdog, American Pit Bull Terrier, West Highland White Terrier, Rat Terrier, Yorkshire Terrier, Dachshund, and Pug.

===Cats===
There are two types of demodectic mange in cats. &quot;Demodex cati&quot; causes follicular mange, similar to that seen in dogs, though it is much less common. &quot;Demodex gatoi&quot; is a more superficial form of mange, causes an itchy skin condition, and is contagious amongst cats.

===Other===
Demodectic mange also occurs in other domestic and wild animals, including captive pandas.

==Diagnosis==
===Dogs===

For demodectic mange, properly performed deep skin scrapings generally allow the veterinarian to identify the microscopic mites. The demodex mite is rarely found on clinically normal dogs, meaning that the presence of any number of mites in a sample is very likely to be significant. Acetate tape impression of the skin is another method to identify mites. In breeds such as the West Highland White Terrier, relatively minor skin irritation which would otherwise be considered allergy should be carefully scraped because of the predilection of these dogs to demodectic mange. Skin scrapings may be used to follow the progress of treatment in demodectic mange.

Alternatively, plasma levels of zinc and copper have been seen to be decreased in dogs with demodicosis. This may be due to inflammation involved in the immune response of demodicosis which can lead to oxidative stress, resulting in dogs with demodicosis to exhibit higher levels of antioxidant productivity. The catalases involved in the antioxidant pathway require the trace minerals zinc and copper. Dogs with demodicosis show a decrease in plasma copper and zinc levels due to the increased demand for antioxidant activity. Therefore, this may be considered as a potential marker for demodicosis.

==Treatment==
===Dogs===
Localized demodectic mange is considered a common puppyhood ailment, with roughly 90% of cases resolving on their own with no treatment. Minor, localized cases should be left to resolve on their own to prevent masking of the more severe generalized form. If treatment is deemed necessary, Goodwinol, a rotenone-based insecticide ointment, is often prescribed, but it can be irritating to the skin. Demodectic mange with secondary infection is treated with antibiotics and medicated shampoos.

For more severe generalized cases, Amitraz is a parasiticidal dip that is licensed for use in many countries (the only FDA approved treatment in the USA) for treating canine demodicosis. It is applied weekly or biweekly for several weeks, until no mites can be detected by skin scrapings. Demodectic mange in dogs can also be managed with avermectins, although there are few countries which license these drugs, which are given by mouth daily, for this use. Ivermectin is used most frequently; collie-like herding breeds often do not tolerate this drug due to a defect in the blood–brain barrier, though not all of them have this defect. Other avermectin drugs that can be used include doramectin and milbemycin.

Recent results suggest that the isoxazolines afoxolaner and fluralaner, given orally, are effective in treating dogs with generalized demodicosis.
Because of the possibility of the immune deficiency being an inherited trait, many veterinarians believe that all puppies with generalized demodex should be spayed or neutered and not reproduce. Females with generalized demodex should be spayed because the stress of the estrus cycle will often bring on a fresh wave of clinical signs.

===Cats===
Cats with &quot;Demodex gatoi&quot; must be treated with weekly or bi-weekly sulfurated lime rinses. &quot;Demodex cati&quot; are treated similarly to canine demodicosis. With veterinary guidance, localized demodectic mange can also be treated with a topical keratolytic and antibacterial agent, followed by a lime sulfur dip or a local application of Rotenone. Ivermectin may also be used. Generalized demodectic mange in cats is more difficult to treat. There are shampoos available that can help to clear dead skin, kill mites and treat bacterial infections. Treatment is in most cases prolonged with multiple applications.

<text>The Sopwith 7F.1 Snipe is a British single-seat biplane fighter of the Royal Air Force (RAF). It was designed and built by the Sopwith Aviation Company during the First World War, and came into squadron service a few weeks before the end of the conflict, in late 1918. The Snipe was not a fast aircraft by the standards of its time, but its excellent climb and manoeuvrability made it a good match for contemporary German fighters. It was selected as the standard postwar single-seat RAF fighter and the last examples were not retired until 1926.

==Design and development==
In April 1917, Herbert Smith, the chief designer of the Sopwith Company, began to design a fighter intended to be the replacement for Sopwith&#x27;s most famous aeroplane, the Camel. The design, the Snipe, was in its initial form a single-bay biplane, slightly smaller than the Camel and intended to be powered by similar engines. The pilot sat higher than in the Camel while the centre-section of the upper wing was uncovered, giving a better view from the cockpit. Armament was to be two Vickers machine guns. In the absence of an official order, Sopwith began construction of two prototypes as a private venture in September 1917. This took advantage of a licence that had been granted to allow construction of four Sopwith Rhino bomber prototypes, only two of which were built. The first prototype Snipe, powered by a Bentley AR.1 rotary engine was completed in October 1917.

The second prototype was completed with the new, more powerful Bentley BR.2, engine, which gave in November 1917. This promised better performance and prompted an official contract for six prototypes to be placed, including the two aircraft built as private ventures. The third prototype to fly, serial number &quot;B9965&quot;, had modified wings, with a wider centre-section and a smaller cut-out for the pilot, while the fuselage had a fully circular section, rather than the slab-sided one of the first two aircraft and the tail was smaller. It was officially tested in December 1917, reaching a speed of and was then rebuilt with longer-span [] two-bay wings (compared with the single bay wings). This allowed the Snipe to compete for Air Board Specification A.1(a) for a high-altitude single-seat fighter. This specification required a speed of at least at and a ceiling of at least while carrying an armament of two fixed and one swivelling machine gun. An oxygen supply and heated clothing were to be provided for the pilot to aid operation at high altitude. The Snipe was tested against three other fighter prototypes, all powered by the Bentley BR.2 engine: the Austin Osprey triplane, the Boulton &amp; Paul Bobolink and the Nieuport B.N.1. While there was little difference in performance between the aircraft, the Sopwith was selected for production, with orders for 1,700 Snipes placed in March 1918.

The Snipe&#x27;s structure was heavier but much stronger than earlier Sopwith fighters. Although not a fast aircraft for 1918, it was very manoeuvrable and much easier to handle than the Camel, with a superior view from the cockpit - especially forwards and upwards. The Snipe had a superior rate of climb and much better high-altitude performance compared with its predecessor, allowing it to fight Germany&#x27;s newer fighters on more equal terms. Further modifications were made to the Snipe during the war and afterwards. The Snipe was built around the Bentley BR2 engine - the last rotary to be used by the RAF. It had a maximum speed of at compared with the Camel&#x27;s at the same altitude and an endurance of three hours. Its fixed armament consisted of two 0.303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine guns on the cowling and it was also able to carry up to four bombs for ground attack, identical to the Camel&#x27;s armament. The design allowed for a Lewis gun to be mounted on the centre section in a similar manner to those carried by the Dolphin but this was not fitted to production aircraft.

Production began in 1918, with more than 4,500 being ordered but ended in 1919, with just under 500 being built, the rest being cancelled due to the end of the war. There was only one variant, the Snipe I, with production by several companies including Sopwith, Boulton &amp; Paul Ltd, Coventry Ordnance Works, D. Napier &amp; Son, Nieuport and Ruston, Proctor and Company. Two aircraft were re-engined with a ABC Dragonfly radial engine and these entered production as the Sopwith Dragon. An armoured version entered production as the Sopwith Salamander.

==Operational history==

===First World War===

In March 1918, an example was evaluated by No.1 Aeroplane Supply Depot (No.1 ASD) at St-Omer in France. Lieutenant Leslie Hollinghurst (later an ace in Dolphins and an air chief marshal) flew to in 45 minutes. He stated that the aircraft was tail heavy and had &quot;a very poor rudder&quot;, but that otherwise manoeuvrability was good.

The first squadron to equip with the new fighter was 43 Squadron, based at Fienvillers in France, which replaced its Camels with 15 Snipes on 30 August 1918. After spending much of September training, it flew its first operational patrols equipped with the Snipe on 24 September. The Snipe also saw service with 4 Squadron Australian Flying Corps (AFC) from October 1918. While 43 Squadron&#x27;s Snipes saw relatively little combat, the Australians had more success, claiming five victories on 26 October and six on 28 October, while on 29 October, 4 Squadron claimed eight Fokker D.VIIs destroyed and two more driven down out of control for the loss of one of 15 Snipes. 208 Squadron converted from Camels in November, too late for the Snipes to see action.

One of the most famous incidents in which the Snipe was involved occurred on 27 October 1918 when Canadian Major William Barker attached to 201 Squadron flew over the Forêt de Mormal in France. Barker&#x27;s Snipe (No. &quot;E8102&quot;) had been brought with him for personal evaluation purposes in connection with his UK-based training duties and was therefore operationally a &quot;one-off&quot;. The engagement with enemy aircraft occurred at the end of a two-week posting to renew his combat experience as Barker was returning to Britain. While on his last operation over the battlefields of France, he attacked a German two-seater aircraft and swiftly shot it down. He was soon attacked by a formation of at least 15 Fokker D.VIIs, an aircraft widely considered to be the best German fighter of the First World War. The ensuing melee was observed by many Allied troops. In the engagement, he was wounded three times, twice losing consciousness momentarily, but managing to shoot down at least three D.VIIs before making a forced landing on the Allied front lines. Barker was awarded the Victoria Cross for this action. The fuselage of this Snipe is preserved at the Canadian War Museum, Ottawa, Ontario.

===Postwar operations===
Following the Armistice with Germany that ended the First World War, Snipes formed part of the British Army of the Rhine, returning to the United Kingdom in August and September 1919, while Snipes replaced Camels in four home defence squadrons based in the United Kingdom. This force was quickly run down and by the end of 1919, only 80 Squadron was equipped with the Snipe.

In 1919, the Snipe took part in the Allied intervention on the side of the White Russians during the Russian Civil War between the Bolsheviks and the counterrevolutionaries, twelve Snipes being used by the RAF mission in north Russia. At least one of the RAF Snipes was captured by the Bolsheviks and pressed into service. The Snipe of 25 Squadron and 56 Squadron were sent to Turkey during the Chanak Crisis in September 1922, flying demonstration flights over Constantinople to deter Turkish forces from attacking British forces in the Dardanelles. 1 Squadron was moved to Iraq in 1922, flying ground attack missions against Kurdish forces led by Sheikh Mahmud Barzanji until the squadron was disbanded in November 1926.

Although the performance demonstrated by the Snipe was unimpressive (tests at Martlesham Heath in October 1918 had shown that the Snipe was inferior to the Martinsyde F.3 and Fokker D.VII), it was selected as the standard postwar single-seat fighter of the RAF. The Martinsyde Buzzard development of the F.3 being 25 per cent more expensive than the Snipe and relying on a French engine that was in short supply (the Hispano-Suiza 8), while the range of fighters powered by the ABC Dragonfly radial engine did not come to fruition owing to failure of that engine. Snipes remained in squadron service as a fighter with the RAF until 1926 and was used as a trainer by the RAF until 1927. It was declared obsolete in 1928. The Canadian Air Force operated the Snipe after the war, but it was phased out in 1923, a year before the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) was formed.

==Survivors and reproductions==
Two complete, original, Sopwith Snipes survive.
&quot;E6938&quot; is displayed in the Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa. Formerly owned by film star Reginald Denny, it was restored in the 1960s.
&quot;E8105&quot; is exhibited at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. Previously, it had been at the Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome, in Rhinebeck, New York. It passed to the NASM after Cole Palen&#x27;s death in December 1993.
The fuselage (minus landing gear, engine and cowl) of Major William G. Barker&#x27;s Snipe, &quot;E8102&quot; is on display at the Canadian War Museum, Ottawa.

===Reproductions===
Antique Aero in California has completed construction of an airworthy, very detailed reproduction Sopwith Snipe. It awaits a new-build 230 h.p. Bentley B.R.2 engine.

Another Snipe reproduction marked as &quot;E8102&quot; was built in New Zealand by The Vintage Aviator Ltd., and was subsequently purchased by Kermit Weeks for his Fantasy of Flight aviation museum in Polk City, Florida. This is airworthy and uses an original Bentley rotary engine.

The RAF Museum in August 2012 took delivery of a static display reproduction of the Snipe. Marked &quot;E6655&quot;, it was constructed in the Wellington workshops of The Vintage Aviator Ltd. in New Zealand. The inclusion of original, non-airworthy parts precludes this aircraft from flight status.

The first reproduction was built by Richard Lincoln Day of Colonia, NJ. This Snipe, marked as &quot;E6837&quot;, flew for one summer at the Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome, in Rhinebeck, NY before being purchased by Doug Champlin for his collection in Mesa, Arizona. This collection was later donated to the Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington.

Tyabb Airport in Victoria, Australia, hosts a reproduction snipe VH-SNP &quot;E8050&quot;. The aircraft first flew on the 17th of October 2014, and is powered by a W670 Radial. This snipe has since been relocated to the RAAF Museum in Point Cook, Victoria

<text>The Millau Viaduct (, ) is a multispan cable-stayed bridge completed in 2004 across the gorge valley of the Tarn near (west of) Millau in the Aveyron department in the Occitanie Region, in Southern France. The design team was led by engineer Michel Virlogeux and English architect Norman Foster. it is the tallest bridge in the world, having a structural height of .

The Millau Viaduct is part of the A75–A71 autoroute axis from Paris to Béziers and Montpellier. The cost of construction was approximately (). It was built over three years, formally inaugurated on 14 December 2004, and opened to traffic two days later on 16 December. The bridge has been consistently ranked as one of the greatest engineering achievements of modern times, and received the 2006 Outstanding Structure Award from the International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering.

==History==
In the 1980s, high levels of road traffic near Millau in the Tarn valley were causing congestion, especially in the summer due to holiday traffic on the route from Paris to Spain. A method of bypassing Millau had long been considered, not only to ease the flow and reduce journey times for long-distance traffic, but also to improve the quality of access to Millau for its local businesses and residents. One of the solutions considered was the construction of a road bridge to span the river and gorge valley. The first plans for a bridge were discussed in 1987 by CETE, and by October 1991 the decision was made to build a high crossing of the Tarn by a structure of around in length. During 1993–1994, the government consulted with seven architects and eight structural engineers. During 1995–1996, a second definition study was made by five associated architect groups and structural engineers. In January 1995, the government issued a declaration of public interest to solicit design approaches for a competition.

In July 1996 the jury decided in favour of a cable-stayed design with multiple spans, as proposed by the SODETEG consortium led by Michel Virlogeux, Norman Foster and Arcadis. The decision to proceed by grant of contract was made in May 1998; then in June 2000, the contest for the construction contract was launched, open to four consortia. In March 2001, Eiffage established the subsidiary Compagnie Eiffage du Viaduc de Millau (CEVM), and was declared winner of the contest and awarded the prime contract in August.

===Possible routes===

In initial studies, four potential options were examined:
# Great Eastern () (yellow route) – passing east of Millau and crossing the valleys of the Tarn and Dourbie on two very high and long bridges (spans of ) whose construction was acknowledged to be problematic. This option would have allowed access to Millau only from the Larzac plateau, using the long and tortuous descent from La Cavalerie. Although this option was shorter and better suited to through-traffic, it did not satisfactorily serve the needs of Millau and its area.
# Great Western () (black route) – longer than the eastern option by , following the Cernon valley. Technically easier (requiring four viaducts), this solution was judged to have negative impacts on the environment, in particular on the picturesque villages of Peyre and Saint-Georges-de-Luzençon. It was more expensive than the preceding option, and served the region badly.
# Near RN9 () (red route) – would have served the town of Millau well, but presented technical difficulties, and would have had a strong impact on existing or planned structures.
# Intermediate (), west of Millau (blue route) – was supported by local opinion, but presented geological difficulties, notably on the question of crossing the valley of the Tarn. Expert investigation concluded that these obstacles were not insurmountable.

The fourth option was selected by ministerial decree on 28 June 1989. It encompassed two possibilities:
# the high solution, envisaging a viaduct more than above the river;
# the low solution, descending into the valley and crossing the river on a bridge, then a viaduct of , extended by a tunnel on the Larzac side.

After long construction studies by the Ministry of Public Works, the low solution was abandoned because it would have intersected the water table, had a negative impact on the town, cost more, and lengthened the driving distance. The choice of the &#x27;high&#x27; solution was decided by ministerial decree on 29 October 1991.

After the choice of the high viaduct, five teams of architects and researchers worked on a technical solution. The concept and design for the bridge was devised by French designer and structural engineer Michel Virlogeux. He worked with the Dutch engineering firm Arcadis, responsible for the structural engineering of the bridge.

===Choosing the definitive route===

The &#x27;high solution&#x27; required the construction of a viaduct. From 1991 to 1993, the structures division of Sétra, directed by Virlogeux, carried out preliminary studies, and examined the feasibility of a single structure spanning the valley. Taking into account technical, architectural, and financial issues, the Administration of Roads opened the question for competition among structural engineers and architects to widen the search for realistic designs. By July 1993, seventeen structural engineers and thirty-eight architects applied as candidates for the preliminary studies. With the assistance of a multidisciplinary commission, the Administration of Roads selected eight structural engineers for a technical study, and seven architects for the architectural study.

===Choice of technical design===
Simultaneously, a school of international experts representing a wide spectrum of expertise (technical, architectural, and landscape), chaired by Jean-François Coste, was established to clarify the choices that had to be made. In February 1995, on the basis of proposals of the architects and structural engineers, and with support of the school of experts, five general designs were identified.

The competition was relaunched: five combinations of architects and structural engineers, drawn from the best candidates of the first phase, were formed; each was to conduct in-depth studies of one of the general designs. On 15 July 1996, Bernard Pons, minister of Public Works, announced the decision of the jury, which was constituted of elected artists and experts, and chaired by Christian Leyrit, the director of highways. The solution of a multiple-span viaduct cable-stayed bridge, presented by the structural engineering group Sogelerg, Europe Etudes Gecti and Serf, and the architects Foster + Partners was declared the best.

Detailed studies were carried out by the successful consortium, steered by the highways authority until mid-1998. After undergoing wind tunnel tests, the shape of the road deck was altered, and detailed corrections were made to the design of the pylons. When the details were eventually finalised, the whole design was approved in late 1998.

===Contractors===

Once the Ministry of Public Works had taken the decision to offer the construction and operation of the viaduct as a grant of contract, an international call for tenders was issued in 1999. Five consortia tendered:
# Compagnie Eiffage du Viaduc de Millau (CEVM), a new subsidiary created by Eiffage;
# PAECH Construction Enterprise, Poland;
# a consortium led by the Spanish company Dragados, with Skanska, Sweden, and Bec, France;
# Société du Viaduc de Millau, including the French companies ASF, Egis Projects, GTM Construction, Bouygues Travaux Publics, SGE, CDC Projets, Tofinso, and the Italian company Autostrade;
# a consortium led by Générale Routière, with Via GTI (France) and Cintra, Nesco, Acciona, and Ferrovial Agroman (Spain).

Piers were built with Lafarge high performance concrete. The pylons of the Millau Viaduct, which are the tallest elements (the tallest one being ) were produced and mounted by PAECH Construction Enterprise from Poland.

The Compagnie Eiffage du Viaduc de Millau, working with the architect Norman Foster, was successful in obtaining the tender. Because the government had already taken the design work to an advanced stage, the technical uncertainties were considerably reduced. A further advantage of this process was to make negotiating the contract easier, reducing public expense, and speeding up construction, while minimising such design work as remained for the contractor.

All the member companies of the Eiffage group had some role in the construction work. The construction consortium was made up of the Eiffage TP company for the concrete part, the Eiffel company for the steel roadway (Gustave Eiffel built the Garabit viaduct in 1884, a railway bridge in the neighbouring Cantal &quot;département&quot;), and the Enerpac company for the roadway&#x27;s hydraulic supports. The engineering group Setec has authority in the project, with SNCF engineering having partial control. was responsible for the job of the bituminous road surface on the bridge deck, and Forclum (fr) for electrical installations. Management was handled by Eiffage Concessions.

The only other business that had a notable role on the building site was Freyssinet, a subsidiary of the Vinci Group specialising in prestressing. It installed the cable stays and put them under tension, while the prestress division of Eiffage was responsible for prestressing the pillar heads.

The steel road deck, and the hydraulic action of the road deck were designed by the Walloon engineering firm Greisch from Liège, Belgium, also an information and communication technologies (ICT) company of the Walloon Region. They carried out the general calculations and the resistance calculations for winds of up to . They also applied the launching technology.

The sliding shutter technology for the bridge piers came from PERI.

===Costs and resources===
The bridge&#x27;s construction cost up to , with a toll plaza north of the viaduct, costing an additional . The builders, Eiffage, financed the construction in return for a concession to collect the tolls for 75 years, until 2080. However, if the concession yields high revenues, the French government can assume control of the bridge as early as 2044.

The project required about of concrete, of steel for the reinforced concrete, and of pre-stressed steel for the cables and shrouds. The builder claims that the lifetime of the bridge will be at least 120 years.

===Opposition===
Numerous organisations opposed the project, including the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), France Nature Environnement, the national federation of motorway users, and Environmental Action. Opponents advanced several arguments:
* The westernmost route would be better, longer by , but a third of the cost with its three more conventional structures.
* The objective of the viaduct would not be achieved; because of the toll, the viaduct would be little used, and the project would not solve Millau&#x27;s congestion problems.
* The project would never break even; toll income would never amortise the initial investment, and the contractor would have to be supported by subsidies.
* The technical difficulties were too great, and the bridge would be dangerous and unsustainable; the pylons, sitting on the shale of the Tarn Valley, would not support the structure adequately.
* The viaduct represented a detour, reducing the number of visitors passing through Millau and slowing its economy.

==Construction==

Two weeks after the laying of the first stone on 14 December 2001, workers started digging deep shafts for the pilings. Each pylon is supported by four concrete pilings. Each piling is deep and in diameter, assuring the stability of the pylons. At the top of the pilings a large footing was poured, in thickness,to reinforce the strength of the pilings. The of concrete necessary for the footings was poured at the same time as pilings.

In March 2002, the pylons emerged from the ground. The speed of construction then rapidly increased. Every three days, each pylon increased in height by . This performance was mainly due to sliding shuttering. Thanks to a system of shoe anchorages and fixed rails in the heart of the pylons, a new layer of concrete could be poured every 20 minutes.

===Launching===
The bridge road deck was constructed on plateaus at both ends of the viaduct, and pushed onto the pylons using bridge launching techniques.
Each half of the assembled road deck was pushed lengthwise from the plateaus to the pylons, passing across one pylon to the next.
During the launching, the road deck was also supported by eight temporary towers, which were removed near the end of construction.
In addition to hydraulic jacks on each plateau pushing the road decks, each pylon was topped with a mechanism on top of each pylon that also pushed the deck.
This mechanism consisted of a computer-controlled pair of wedges under the deck manipulated by hydraulics.
The upper and lower wedge of each pair pointed in opposite directions.
The wedges were hydraulically operated, and moved repeatedly in the following sequence:

# The lower wedge slides under the upper wedge, raising it to the roadway above, and then forcing the upper wedge still higher to lift the roadway
# Both wedges move forward together, advancing the roadway a short distance
# The lower wedge retracts from under the upper wedge, lowering the roadway and allowing the upper wedge to drop away from the roadway; the lower wedge then moves back all the way to its starting position. There is now a linear distance between the two wedges equal to the distance forward the roadway has just moved.
# The upper wedge moves backward, placing it further back along the roadway, adjacent to the front tip of the lower wedge and ready to repeat the cycle and advance the roadway by another increment.

The launching advanced the road deck at per cycle which was roughly four minutes long.

The mast pieces were driven over the new road deck lying down horizontally. The pieces were joined to form the one complete mast, still lying horizontally. The mast was then tilted upwards, as one piece, at one time in a tricky operation. In this way, each mast was erected on top of the corresponding concrete pylon. The stays connecting the masts and the deck were then installed, and the bridge was tensioned overall, and weight tested. After this, the temporary pylons could be removed.

===Construction records===
The construction Millau Viaduct broke several records:
* A mega-structure bridge constructed several hundred meters above ground, without any loss of life throughout the three year construction period (First stone laid on 14 December 2001, Official inauguration on 14 December 2004).
* The highest pylons in the world: pylons P2 and P3, and in height respectively, broke the French record previously held by the Tulle and Verrières viaducts (), and the world record previously held by the Kochertal Viaduct (Germany), which is at its highest;
* The highest bridge tower in the world: the mast atop pylon P2 peaks at ;
* The highest road bridge deck in Europe, above the Tarn at its highest point; it is nearly twice as tall as the previous tallest vehicular bridges in Europe, the Europabrücke in Austria and the Italia Viaduct in Italy.

Since opening in 2004, the deck height of Millau has been surpassed by several suspension bridges in China, including Sidu River Bridge, Baling River Bridge, and two spans (Beipan River Guanxing Highway Bridge and Beipan River Hukun Expressway Bridge) over the Beipan River. In 2012, Mexico&#x27;s Baluarte Bridge surpassed Millau as the world&#x27;s highest cable-stayed bridge. The Royal Gorge suspension bridge in the U.S. state of Colorado is also higher, with a bridge deck approximately over the Arkansas River.

==Location==

The Millau Viaduct is on the territory of the communes of Millau and Creissels, France, in the &quot;département&quot; of Aveyron. Before the bridge was constructed, traffic had to descend into the Tarn valley and pass along the route nationale N9 near the town of Millau, causing much traffic congestion at the beginning and end of the July and August holiday season. The bridge now traverses the Tarn valley above its lowest point, linking two limestone plateaus, the Causse du Larzac and the , and is inside the perimeter of the Grands Causses regional natural park.

The Millau Viaduct forms the last link of the existing A75 autoroute (known as &quot;la Méridienne&quot;), from Clermont-Ferrand to Béziers. The A75, with the A10 and A71, provides a continuous high-speed route south from Paris through Clermont-Ferrand to the Languedoc region, thence to Spain, considerably reducing the cost and time of vehicle traffic travelling along this route. Many tourists heading to southern France and Spain follow this route because it is direct and without tolls for the between Clermont-Ferrand and Béziers, except for the bridge.

The Eiffage group, which constructed the Viaduct also operates it, under a government contract, which allows the company to collect tolls for up to 75 years. As of 2018, the toll bridge costs for light automobiles (or during the peak season of 15 June to 15 September).

==Structure==
===Pylons and abutments===
Each of the seven pylons is supported by four deep shafts, deep and in diameter.


The abutments are concrete structures that provide anchorage for the road deck to the ground in the Causse du Larzac and the Causse Rouge.

===Road deck===
The metallic road deck, which appears very light despite its total mass of around , is long and wide. It comprises eight spans. The six central spans measure , and the two outer spans are . These are composed of 173 central box beams, the spinal column of the construction, onto which the lateral floors and the lateral box beams were welded. The central box beams have a cross-section, and a length of for a total weight of . The deck has an inverse airfoil shape, providing negative lift in strong wind conditions.

===Masts===
The seven masts, each high, and weighing around , are set on top of the concrete pylons. Between each of them, eleven stays (steel cables) are anchored, providing support for the road deck.

===Cable stays===
Each mast of the Viaduct is equipped with a monoaxial layer of eleven pairs of cable-stays; laid face to face. Depending on their length, the cable stays were made of 55 to 91 high tensile steel cables, or strands, themselves formed of seven strands of steel (a central strand with six intertwined strands). Each strand has triple protection against corrosion (galvanisation, a coating of petroleum wax, and an extruded polyethylene sheath). The exterior envelope of the stays is itself coated along its entire length with a double helical weatherstrip. The idea is to avoid running water which, in high winds, could cause vibration in the stays and compromise the stability of the viaduct.

The stays were installed by the Freyssinet company.

===Road surface===
To allow for deformations of the metal road deck under traffic, a special surface of modified bitumen was installed by research teams from . The surface is somewhat flexible to adapt to deformations in the steel deck without cracking, but it must nevertheless have sufficient strength to withstand motorway conditions (fatigue, density, texture, adherence, anti-rutting etc.). The &#x27;ideal formula&#x27; was found after two years of research.

===Electrical installations===
The electrical installations of the viaduct are large in proportion to the size of the bridge. There are of high-current cables, of fibre optics, of low-current cables, and 357 telephone sockets; allowing maintenance teams to communicate with each other and with the command post. These are situated on the deck, on the pylons, and on the masts.

The pylons, road deck, masts, and cable stays are equipped with a multitude of sensors to enable structural health monitoring. These are designed to detect the slightest movement in the Viaduct, and measure its resistance to wear-and-tear over time. Anemometers, accelerometers, inclinometers, and temperature sensors are all used for the instrumentation network.

Twelve fibre optic extensometers were installed in the base of pylon P2. Being the tallest of all, it is therefore under the most intense stress. These sensors detect movements on the order of a micrometre. Other extensometers, electrical this time, are distributed on top of P2 and P7. This apparatus is capable of taking up to 100 readings per second. In high winds, they continuously monitor the reactions of the Viaduct to extreme conditions. Accelerometers placed strategically on the road deck monitor the oscillations that can affect the metal structure. Displacements of the deck on the abutment level are measured to the nearest millimetre. The cable stays are also instrumented, and their ageing meticulously analysed. Additionally, two piezoelectric sensors gather traffic data: weight of vehicles, average speed, density of the flow of traffic, etc. This system can distinguish between fourteen different types of vehicle.

The data is transmitted by an Ethernet network to a computer in the IT room at the management building situated near the toll plaza.

===Toll plaza===
The toll plaza is on the A75 autoroute; the bridge toll booths and the buildings for the commercial and technical management teams are situated north of the viaduct. The toll plaza is protected by a canopy in the shape of a leaf, formed from tendrilled concrete, using the ceracem process. Consisting of 53 elements (voussoirs), the canopy is long and wide. It weighs around .

The toll plaza can accommodate sixteen lanes of traffic, eight in each direction. At times of low traffic volume, the central booth is capable of servicing vehicles in both directions. A car park and viewing station, equipped with public toilets, is situated at each side of the toll plaza. The total cost was .

===Rest area of Brocuéjouls===
The rest area of Brocuéjouls, named &quot;Aire du Viaduc de Millau&quot;, is situated just north of the viaduct, and is centred on an old farm building named &#x27;Ferme de Brocuéjouls&#x27;. It was inaugurated by the prefect of Aveyron, Chantal Jourdan, on 30 June 2006, after 7 months of works. The farm and its surroundings can accommodate entertainment and tourism promotion activities.

The cost of this work amounted to :
* of state funds for the realisation of the area (access roads, parking, rest area, toilets, etc.)
* for the restoration of the old farm building of Brocuéjouls (all two tranches)

==Impact and events==

===Pedestrian sporting events===
Unusually for a bridge closed to pedestrians, a run took place in 2004, and another on 13 May 2007:
* December 2004 – 19,000 walkers and runners of the Three Bridge Walk had the privilege of crossing the bridge deck for the first time, but the walk was not authorised to go further than pylon P1; the bridge was still closed to traffic.
* 13 May 2007 – 10,496 runners took the departure of the race from Place de Mandarous, in the centre of Millau, to the southern end of the Viaduct. After starting on the northern side, they crossed the viaduct, then retraced their steps. Total distance: .

===Events and popular culture===
* In 2004, a fire started on the slope of the because of a spark originating from a welder; some trees were destroyed in the fire.
* The speed limit on the bridge was reduced from to because tourists were slowing down to take photos. Soon after the bridge opened to traffic, cars were stopping on the hard shoulder so that travelers could view the landscape and the bridge.
* A postage stamp was designed by Sarah Lazarevic to commemorate the opening of the Viaduct.
* The Chinese transport minister at the time visited the bridge on the first anniversary of its opening. The commission was impressed by the technical prowess of the bridge&#x27;s immense construction, but also by the legal and financial assembly of the Viaduct. However, according to the minister, he did not envisage building a counterpart in People&#x27;s Republic of China.
* The cabinet of the governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger, who envisaged the construction of a bridge in San Francisco Bay, asked the council of the town hall of Millau about the popularity of the construction of the viaduct.
* This bridge was featured in a scene of the 2007 film &quot;Mr. Bean&#x27;s Holiday&quot;.
* The bridge also appeared in the ending of the console and PC versions of the third-person shooter video game &quot;James Bond 007: Blood Stone&quot;, where James Bond confronts the game&#x27;s true antagonist.
* The hosts of the British motoring show &quot;Top Gear&quot; featured the bridge during Series 7, when they took a Ford GT, Pagani Zonda, and Ferrari F430 Spyder on a road trip across France to see the newly completed bridge.
* Richard Hammond, one of the above hosts on &quot;Top Gear,&quot; explored the engineering aspects in the construction of the Millau Viaduct in Series 2 of &quot;Richard Hammond&#x27;s Engineering Connections.&quot;
* The bridge was featured in Series 2 of &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Bridges.&quot;
* Construction of the bridge was featured in the series &quot;How Did They Build That? &quot;

<text>Bertram Sidney Thomas (13 June 1892 – 27 December 1950) was an English diplomat and explorer who is the first documented Westerner to cross the Rub&#x27; al Khali (Empty Quarter). He was also a scientist who practiced craniofacial anthropometry.

==Biography==
Bertram Thomas was born in Pill near Bristol and educated at Trinity College, Cambridge.

After working for the Civil Service in the General Post Office, he served in Belgium during World War I. He was commissioned in the Somerset Light Infantry in January 1916 and served in Mesopotamia (now Iraq) between 1916 and 1918. He worked as an Assistant Political Officer in this country from 1918 to 1922, and Assistant British Representative in Transjordan (now Jordan), from 1922 to 1924. He was appointed as Finance Minister and Wazir to Taimur bin Feisal, the Sultan of Muscat and Oman (now Oman), a post he held from 1925 to 1932. In this capacity, he undertook a number of expeditions into the desert, and became the first European to cross the Rub&#x27; al Khali guided by Bedouin of the Rashid tribe, from 1930 and 1931, a journey he recounted in &quot;Arabia Felix&quot; (1932), in which he described this desert&#x27;s animals, inhabitants, and culture.

Besides &quot;Arabia Felix&quot;, Thomas wrote several other books, including &quot;The Arabs: The Epic Life Story of a People Who Have Left Their Deep Impress on the World&quot; (London: T. Butterworth, 1930; Garden City, New York: Doubleday, Doran and Co., Inc., 1937).

During World War II, Thomas headed the Middle East Centre for Arab Studies in Jerusalem, where British Army officers were taught Arabic language and culture.

He returned to England and died in the house in which he was born, in 1950 aged 58.

Two species of Omani reptiles are named in his honor, &quot;Platyceps thomasi&quot; and &quot;Uromastyx thomasi&quot;.

==Awards==
He was awarded the OBE in 1920 and CMG in 1949. In 1932 he was also awarded the Livingstone Medal of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society. One of the Society&#x27;s most prestigious awards, it is offered for outstanding service of a humanitarian nature with a clear geographical dimension.

==Film about Bertram Thomas==
A recent film called &quot;Crossing the Empty Quarter&quot; was created by the Anglo-Oman Society&#x27;s Chairman, Richard Muir — the ex-Ambassador to Oman — from footage taken by Thomas on his journey, and photographs from the Library of the Oriental Institute in Cambridge.

<text>The Public Universal Friend (born Jemima Wilkinson; November 29, 1752 – July 1, 1819) was an American preacher born in Cumberland, Rhode Island, to Quaker parents. After suffering a severe illness in 1776, the Friend claimed to have died and been reanimated as a genderless evangelist named the Public Universal Friend, and afterward shunned both birth name and gendered pronouns. In androgynous clothes, the Friend preached throughout the northeastern United States, attracting many followers who became the Society of Universal Friends.

The Friend&#x27;s theology was broadly similar to that of most Quakers. The Friend stressed free will, opposed slavery, and supported sexual abstinence. The most committed members of the Society of Universal Friends were a group of unmarried women who took leading roles in their households and community. In the 1790s, members of the Society acquired land in Western New York where they formed the town of Jerusalem near Penn Yan, New York. The Society of Universal Friends ceased to exist by the 1860s. Many writers have portrayed the Friend as a woman, and either a manipulative fraudster, or a pioneer for women&#x27;s rights; others have viewed the Friend as transgender or non-binary and a figure in trans history.

== Early life ==
Wilkinson, who would later become the Public Universal Friend, was born on November 29, 1752, in Cumberland, Rhode Island, as the eighth child of Amy (or Amey, née Whipple) and Jeremiah Wilkinson, becoming the fourth generation of the family to live in America. The child was given the name Jemima after Jemima, one of the biblical Job&#x27;s daughters. Wilkinson&#x27;s great-grandfather, Lawrence Wilkinson, was an officer in the army of Charles I who had emigrated from England around 1650 and was active in colonial government. Jeremiah Wilkinson was a cousin of Stephen Hopkins, the colony&#x27;s longtime governor and signer of the Declaration of Independence. Jeremiah attended traditional worship with the Society of Friends (the Quakers) at the Smithfield Meeting House. Early biographer David Hudson says that Amy was also a member of the Society for many years, while later biographer Herbert Wisbey finds no evidence of that, but quotes Moses Brown as saying the child was &quot;born such&quot; because of Jeremiah&#x27;s affiliation. Amy died when Wilkinson was 12 or 13 in 1764, shortly after giving birth to a twelfth child.

Wilkinson had fine black hair and eyes, and from an early age was strong and athletic, becoming an adept equestrian as a child, remaining so in adulthood, and liking spirited horses and ensuring that animals received good care. An avid reader, Wilkinson could quote long passages of the Bible and prominent Quaker texts from memory. Little else is reliably known about Wilkinson&#x27;s childhood; some early accounts such as Hudson&#x27;s describe Wilkinson as being fond of fine clothes and averse to labor, but there is no contemporaneous evidence of this and Wisbey considers it doubtful. Biographer Paul Moyer says it may have been invented to fit a then-common narrative that people who experienced dramatic religious awakenings were formerly profligate sinners.

In the mid-1770s, Wilkinson began attending meetings in Cumberland with New Light Baptists who had formed as part of the Great Awakening and emphasized individual enlightenment, and stopped attending meetings of the Society of Friends— being disciplined for that in February 1776 and disowned by the Smithfield Meeting in August. Wilkinson&#x27;s sister Patience was dismissed at the same time for having an illegitimate child; brothers Stephen and Jeptha had been dismissed by the pacifistic Society in May 1776 for training for military service. Amid these family disturbances and the broader ones of the American Revolutionary War, dissatisfied with the New Light Baptists and shunned by mainstream Quakers, Wilkinson faced much stress in 1776.

== Becoming the Public Universal Friend ==
In October 1776 Wilkinson contracted an epidemic disease, most likely typhus, and was bedridden and near death with a high fever. The future preacher&#x27;s family summoned a doctor from Attleboro, six miles away, and neighbors kept up a death-watch at night. The fever broke after several days. The Friend later reported that Wilkinson had died, receiving revelations from God through two archangels who proclaimed there was &quot;Room, Room, Room, in the many Mansions of eternal glory for Thee and for everyone&quot;. The Friend further said that Wilkinson&#x27;s soul had ascended to heaven and the body had been reanimated with a new spirit charged by God with preaching his word, that of the &quot;Publick Universal Friend&quot;, describing that name in the words of as &quot;a new name which the mouth of the Lord hath named&quot;. The name referenced the designation the Society of Friends used for members who traveled from community to community to preach, &quot;Public Friends&quot;. In the 18th and 19th centuries, some writers said that Wilkinson did briefly die during the illness, or even was dead for an extended time before rising dramatically from a coffin, while others suggested that the entire illness was feigned. Accounts by the doctor and other witnesses state that the illness was real, but none of them say that Wilkinson died.

From that time on, the Friend refused to answer to &quot;Jemima Wilkinson&quot;, ignoring or chastising those who insisted on using it. Hudson says that when visitors asked if it was the name of the person they were addressing, the Friend simply quoted (&quot;thou sayest it&quot;). Identifying as neither male nor female, the Friend asked not to be referred to with gendered pronouns. Followers respected these wishes; they referred only to &quot;the Public Universal Friend&quot; or short forms such as &quot;the Friend&quot; or &quot;P.U.F.&quot;, and many avoided gender-specific pronouns even in private diaries, while others used &quot;he&quot;. When someone asked if the Friend was male or female, the preacher replied &quot;I am that I am&quot;, saying the same thing to a man who criticized the Friend&#x27;s manner of dress (adding, in the latter case, &quot;there is nothing indecent or improper in my dress or appearance; I am not accountable to mortals&quot;).

The Friend dressed in a manner perceived to be either androgynous or masculine, in long, loose clerical robes which were most often black, and wore a white or purple kerchief or cravat around the neck like men of the time. The preacher did not wear a hair-cap indoors, like women of the era, and outdoors wore broad-brimmed, low-crowned beaver hats of a style worn by Quaker men. Accounts of the Friend&#x27;s &quot;feminine-masculine tone of voice&quot; varied; some hearers described it as &quot;clear and harmonious&quot;, or said the preacher spoke &quot;with ease and facility&quot;, &quot;clearly, though without elegance&quot;; others described it as &quot;grum and shrill&quot;, or like a &quot;kind of croak, unearthly and sepulchral&quot;. The Friend was said to move easily, freely, and modestly, and was described by Ezra Stiles as &quot;decent &amp; graceful &amp; grave&quot;.

== Beliefs, preaching, and the Society of Universal Friends ==
The Friend began to travel and preach throughout Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania accompanied by brother Stephen and sisters Deborah, Elizabeth, Marcy, and Patience, all of whom were disowned by the Society of Friends. Early on, the Public Universal Friend preached that people needed to repent of their sins and be saved before an imminent Day of Judgment. According to Abner Brownell, the preacher predicted that the fulfillment of some prophecies of Revelation would begin around April 1780, 42 months after the Universal Friend began preaching, and interpreted New England&#x27;s Dark Day in May 1780 as fulfillment of that prediction. According to a Philadelphia newspaper, later followers Sarah Richards and James Parker believed themselves to be the two witnesses mentioned in Revelation and accordingly wore sackcloth for a time.

The Friend did not bring a Bible to worship meetings, which were initially held outdoors or in borrowed meeting houses, but preached long sections of the scriptures from memory. The meetings attracted large audiences, including some who formed a congregation of &quot;Universal Friends&quot;, making the Friend the first American to found a religious community. These followers included roughly equal numbers of women and men who were predominantly under 40. Most were from Quaker backgrounds, though mainstream Quakers discouraged and disciplined members for attending meetings with the Friend. Indeed, the Society of Friends had disowned the Friend, disapproving of what William Savery considered &quot;pride and ambition to distinguish [them]self from the rest of mankind&quot;. Free Quakers, disowned by the main Society of Friends for participating in the American War of Independence, were particularly sympathetic and opened meeting houses to the Universal Friends, appreciating that many of them had also sympathized with the Patriot cause, including members of the Friend&#x27;s family.

Popular newspapers and pamphlets covered the Friend&#x27;s sermons in detail by the mid-1780s, with several Philadelphia newspapers being particularly critical; they fomented enough opposition that noisy crowds gathered outside each place the preacher stayed or spoke in 1788. Most papers focused more on the preacher&#x27;s ambiguous gender than on theology, which was broadly similar to the teachings of most Quakers; one person who heard the Friend in 1788 said &quot;from common report I expected to hear something out of the way in doctrine, which is not the case, in fact [I] heard nothing but what is common among preachers&quot; in mainstream Quaker churches. The Friend&#x27;s theology was so similar to that of the mainstream Quakers&#x27; that one of two published works associated with the preacher was a plagiarism of Isaac Penington&#x27;s &quot;Works&quot; because, according to Abner Brownell, the Friend felt that the sentiments would have more resonance if republished in the name of the Universal Friend. The Universal Friends also used language similar to that of the Society of Friends, using &quot;thee&quot; and &quot;thou&quot; instead of the more formal singular &quot;you&quot;.

The Public Universal Friend rejected the ideas of predestination and election, held that anyone regardless of gender could gain access to God&#x27;s light and that God spoke directly to individuals who had free will to choose how to act and believe, and believed in the possibility of universal salvation. Calling for the abolition of slavery, the Friend persuaded followers who held people in slavery to free them. Several members of the congregation of Universal Friends were black, and they acted as witnesses for manumission papers. The Friend preached humility and hospitality towards everyone; kept religious meetings open to the public, and housed and fed visitors, including those who came only out of curiosity and indigenous people, with whom the preacher generally had a cordial relationship. The Friend had few personal possessions, mostly given by followers, and never held any real property except in trust.

The Friend preached sexual abstinence and disfavored marriage, but did not see celibacy as mandatory and accepted marriage, especially as preferable to breaking abstinence outside of wedlock. Most followers did marry, but the portion who did not was significantly above the national average of the time. The preacher also held that women should &quot;obey God rather than men&quot;, and the most committed followers included roughly four dozen unmarried women known as the Faithful Sisterhood who took on leading roles of the sort which were often reserved to men. The portion of households headed by women in the Society&#x27;s settlements (20%) was much higher than in surrounding areas.

Around 1785, the Friend met Sarah and Abraham Richards. The Richards&#x27; unhappy marriage ended in 1786, when Abraham died on a visit to the Friend. Sarah, together with her infant daughter, took up residence with the Friend, adopted a similarly androgynous hairstyle, dress, and mannerisms (as did a few other close female friends), and came to be called Sarah Friend. The Friend entrusted Richards with holding the society&#x27;s property in trust, and sent her to preach in one part of the country when the Friend was in another. Richards had a large part in planning and building the house in which she and the preacher lived in the town of Jerusalem, and when she died in 1793, she left her child to the Friend&#x27;s care.

In October 1794, the Friend and several followers dined with Thomas Morris (son of financier Robert Morris) in Canandaigua at the invitation of Timothy Pickering, and accompanied him to talks with the Iroquois aimed at producing the Treaty of Canandaigua. With Pickering&#x27;s permission and an interpreter, the Friend gave a speech to the US government officials and Iroquois chiefs about &quot;the Importance of Peace &amp; Love&quot;, which was liked by the Iroquois.

== Settlement of the Gore and Jerusalem, and legal issues ==

In the mid-1780s, the Universal Friends began to plan a town for themselves in western New York. By late 1788, vanguard members of the Society had established a settlement in the Genesee River area; by March 1790, it was ready enough that the rest of the Universal Friends set out to join it, making it the largest non-Native community in western New York. However, problems arose. James Parker spent three weeks in 1791 petitioning the governor and land office of New York on behalf of the Society to get a title to the land that the Friends had settled, but while most of the buildings and other improvements that the Universal Friends made were to the east of the initial Preemption Line and thus in New York, when the line was resurveyed in 1792 at least 25 homes and farms were now west of it, outside the area granted by New York, and residents were forced to repurchase their lands from the Pulteney Association. The town, which had been known as the Friend&#x27;s Settlement, therefore came to be called The Gore.

Furthermore, the lands were in the tract on which Phelps and Gorham defaulted which was resold to financier Robert Morris and then to the Pulteney Association, absentee British speculators. Each change of hands drove prices higher, as did an influx of new settlers attracted by the Society&#x27;s improvements to the area. The community lacked a solid title to enough land for all its members, and some left. Others wanted to profit by taking ownership of the land for themselves, including Parker and William Potter. To address the first of these issues, members of the Society of Universal Friends had secured some alternative sites. Abraham Dayton acquired a large area of land in Canada from Governor John Graves Simcoe, though Sarah Richards persuaded the Friend not to move so far. Separately, Thomas Hathaway and Benedict Robinson had purchased a site in 1789 along a creek which they named Brook Kedron that emptied into the Crooked Lake (Keuka Lake). The new town which the Universal Friends began there came to be called Jerusalem.

The second issue, however, came to a head in the fall of 1799. Judge William Potter, Ontario County magistrate James Parker, and several disillusioned former followers led several attempts to arrest the Friend for blasphemy, which some writers argue was motivated by disagreements over land ownership and power. An officer tried to seize the Friend while riding with Rachel Malin in the Gore, but the Friend, a skilled horse-rider, escaped. The officer and an assistant later tried to arrest the preacher at home in Jerusalem, but the women of the house drove the men off and tore their clothes. A third attempt was carefully planned by a posse of 30 men who surrounded the home after midnight, broke down the door with an ax, and intended to carry the preacher off in an oxcart. A doctor who had come with the posse stated that the Friend was in too poor a state of health to be moved, and they made a deal that the Friend would appear before an Ontario county court in June 1800, but not before Justice Parker. When the Friend appeared before the court, it ruled that no indictable offense had been committed, and invited the preacher to give a sermon to those in attendance.

== Death and legacy ==

The Public Universal Friend&#x27;s health had been declining since the turn of the century; by 1816 the preacher had begun to suffer from a painful edema, but continued to receive visitors and give sermons. The Friend gave a final regular sermon in November 1818 and preached for the last time at the funeral of sister Patience Wilkinson Potter in April 1819.

The Friend died on July 1, 1819; the congregation&#x27;s death book records &quot;25 minutes past 2 on the Clock, The Friend went from here.&quot; In accordance with the Friend&#x27;s wishes, only a regular meeting and no funeral service was held afterwards. The body was placed in a coffin with an oval glass window set in top, interred four days after death in a thick stone vault in the cellar of the Friend&#x27;s house. Several years later, the coffin was removed and buried in an unmarked grave in accordance with the preacher&#x27;s preference. Obituaries appeared in papers throughout the eastern United States. Close followers remained faithful, but they too died over time; the congregation&#x27;s numbers dwindled due to their inability to attract new converts amid a number of legal and religious disagreements. The Society of Universal Friends disappeared by the 1860s.
The Friend&#x27;s Home and temporary burial chamber stands in the town of Jerusalem, and it is included on the National Register of Historic Places. It is believed to be located on the same branch of Keuka Lake as the birthplace of Seneca chief Red Jacket, but his birthplace is disputed. The Yates County Genealogical and Historical Society&#x27;s museums in Penn Yan exhibit the Friend&#x27;s portrait, Bible, carriage, hat, saddle, and documents from the Society of Universal Friends. As late as the 1900s, inhabitants of Little Rest, Rhode Island, called a species of solidago &quot;Jemima weed&quot; because its appearance in the town coincided with the preacher&#x27;s first visit to the area in the 1770s.

The Friend and followers were pioneers of the area between Seneca and Keuka lakes. The Society of Universal Friends erected a grain mill in Dresden.

== Interpretations and legends ==

Although the Public Universal Friend identified as genderless, neither a man nor a woman, many writers have portrayed the preacher as a woman, and either a fraudulent schemer who deceived and manipulated followers or a pioneering leader who founded several towns in which women were empowered to take on roles often reserved to men. The first view was taken by many writers in the 18th and 19th centuries, including David Hudson, whose hostile and inaccurate biography (written to influence a court case over the Society&#x27;s land) was long influential. These writers circulated myths of the Friend despotically bossing followers around or banishing them for years, making married followers divorce, taking their property, or even attempting and failing to raise the dead or walk on water; there is no contemporaneous evidence for these stories, and people who knew the Friend, including some who were never followers, said the rumors were false.

Another story began at a 1787 meeting, after which Sarah Wilson said Abigail Dayton tried to strangle Wilson while she slept but choked her bedmate Anna Steyers by mistake. Steyers denied anything had happened, and others present attributed Wilson&#x27;s fears to a nightmare. Nevertheless, Philadelphia papers printed an embellished version of the accusation and several follow-ups, with critics alleging the attack must have had the Friend&#x27;s approval, and the story eventually morphing into one in which the Friend (who was in a different state at the time) strangled Wilson. One widespread allegation which sparked much hostility was the accusation that the preacher claimed to be Jesus; the Friend and the Universal Friends repeatedly denied this accusation.

Modern writers have often portrayed the Friend as a pioneer, an early figure in the history of women&#x27;s rights (a view taken by Susan Juster and Catherine Brekus) or in transgender history (a view explored by Scott Larson and Rachel Hope Cleves). Historian Michael Bronski says that the Friend would not have been called transgender or transvestite &quot;by the standards and the vocabulary&quot; of the time, but has called the Friend a &quot;transgender evangelist&quot;. Juster calls the Friend a &quot;spiritual transvestite&quot;, and says that followers considered the Friend&#x27;s androgynous clothing congruent with the genderless spirit which they believed animated the preacher.

Juster and others state that, to followers, the Friend may have embodied Paul&#x27;s statement in Galatians 3:28 that &quot;there is neither male nor female&quot; in Christ. Catherine Wessinger, Brekus, and others state that the Friend defied the idea of gender as binary and as natural and essential or innate, though Brekus and Juster argue that the Friend nonetheless reinforced views of male superiority by &quot;dressing like a man&quot; and repeatedly insisting on not being a woman. Scott Larson, disagreeing with narratives that place the Public Universal Friend into the gender binary as a woman, writes that the Friend can be understood as a chapter in trans history &quot;before &#x27;transgender. Bronski cites the Friend as a rare instance of an early American publicly identifying as non-binary.

T. Fleischmann&#x27;s essay &quot;Time Is the Thing the Body Moves Through&quot; examines the Friend&#x27;s narrative with an eye to the colonizing nature of evangelism in the US, viewing it as &quot;a way to think through the limitations of imagination as a white settler&quot;. The Public Universal Friend was also featured in an episode of the NPR radio program and podcast &quot;Throughline&quot;.

<text>Carlos James Lozada (September 6, 1946 – November 20, 1967) was a member of the United States Army who was one of five Puerto Ricans who received the Medal of Honor during the Vietnam War.

==Early years==
Lozada was born in Caguas, Puerto Rico. He graduated from high school in 1966 and soon married. Lozada then joined the United States Army.

==Vietnam War==
The United States at that time was involved in the Vietnam War and on June 11, 1967, Lozada was sent to Vietnam and assigned to Co. A, 2nd Battalion, 503 Infantry, 173rd Airborne Brigade.

Lozada&#x27;s unit was heavily engaged during the Battle of Dak To. On November 20, 1967, PFC Lozada spotted a North Vietnamese Army company rapidly approaching his outpost. He alerted his comrades and opened fire with a machine gun, killing at least twenty of the enemy soldiers and disrupting their initial attack. He realized that if he abandoned his position there would be nothing to hold back the surging North Vietnamese soldiers and his entire company withdrawal would be jeopardized – as a result he told his comrades to move to the back and that he would supply cover for them. He continued to deliver a heavy and accurate volume of suppressive fire against the enemy until he was mortally wounded and had to be carried during the withdrawal.

Lozada was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor in December 1969.

==Medal of Honor citation==

<doc id="680912" wikidata="Q529591" url="?curid=680912" title="Anthony Caro">
<text>Sir Anthony Alfred Caro (8 March 192423 October 2013) was an English abstract sculptor whose work is characterised by assemblages of metal using &#x27;found&#x27; and industrial objects. He began as a member of the modernist school, having worked with Henry Moore early in his career. He was lauded as the greatest British sculptor of his generation.

==Early life and education==
Anthony Caro was born in New Malden, Surrey, England to a Jewish family and was the youngest of three children. 

When Caro was three, his father, a stockbroker, moved the family to a farm in Churt, Surrey. Caro was educated at Charterhouse School, where his housemaster introduced him to British sculptor Charles Wheeler. During holidays, he studied at the Farnham School of Art (now the University for the Creative Arts) and worked in Wheeler&#x27;s studio 

When he left school he spent a brief period in an architect&#x27;s office in Guildford drawing plans, which he did not take to, so his father suggested he study engineering. He later earned a degree in engineering at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge. 

In 1946, after time in the Royal Navy, he studied sculpture at the Regent Street Polytechnic before pursuing further studies at the Royal Academy Schools from 1947 until 1952. 

==Work==

Anthony Caro encountered modernism at art school, and when working as a studio assistant to Henry Moore from 1951-53. In 1955 he exhibited two sculptures in the group exhibition New Painters and Painter-Sculptors at the Institute of Contemporary Art, London and in 1956 he had his first solo show at Galleria del Naviglio in Milan. 

In 1959 Caro was awarded a Ford Foundation scholarship to undertake a research trip to The United States of America, which radically changed his approach to sculpture. During this trip he met the critic Clement Greenberg, as well as the Colour Field painters Kenneth Noland, Helen Frankenthaler and Robert Motherwell, for the first time. After being introduced to the American sculptor David Smith, he abandoned his earlier figurative work and started constructing sculptures by welding or bolting together pieces of steel such as I-beams, steel plates and meshes. &quot;Twenty Four Hours&quot; (1960), in Tate Britain since 1975, is one of his earliest abstract sculptures in painted steel. Often the finished piece was then painted in a bold flat colour.

Caro found international success in the late 1950s. He is often credited with the significant innovation of removing the sculpture from its plinth, although Smith and Brâncuși had both previously taken steps in the same direction. Caro&#x27;s sculptures are usually self-supporting and sit directly on the floor. In doing so, they remove a barrier between the work and the viewer, who is invited to approach and interact with the sculpture from all sides.

In 1963 Caro moved to Bennington, Vermont, where he made a prolific body of abstract, brightly coloured sculptures, including &quot;Slow Movement&quot; (1965), which is now part of the Arts Council Collection. In 1964 he opened his first exhibition in New York at the Andre Emmerich Gallery, showcasing these bold new works.

From 1970 onwards, Caro began to make sculptures in rusted, then varnished or waxed, steel. In 1972 he made a significant series of sculptures at Ripamonte Factory in Veduggio, which included fourteen new works in soft edge roll end steel. This way of working continued, and from 1974-1976 Caro worked at York Steel Company Factory in Toronto, where he produced 37 large-scale sculptures later known as the &quot;Flats&quot; series.

In 1978, Caro was commissioned to design a sculpture for architect I M Pei’s new East Wing building of the National Gallery, Washington, DC. This sculpture, &quot;National Gallery Ledge Piece&quot; (1978), was architectural in scale and installed in situ.

In 1980, Caro was trying to organise an exhibition of British abstract art in South African townships when he met Robert Loder. In 1981, when staying in New York State, the pair, alongside curator Terry Fenton and painter and wife of Caro Sheila Girling, developed the idea of running workshops for professional artists, which became the Triangle Arts Trust. They held the first Triangle workshop in 1982 for thirty sculptors and painters from the US, the UK and Canada at Pine Plains, New York.

Caro&#x27;s work changed direction in the 1980s with the introduction of more literal elements, with a series of figures drawn from classical Greece. After visiting Greece in 1985, and closely studying classical friezes, he embarked on a series of large-scale narrative works, including &quot;After Olympia&quot;, a panorama more than long, inspired by the temple to Zeus at Olympia. Latterly he has attempted large scale installation pieces, one of which, &quot;Sea Music&quot;, stands on the quay at Poole, Dorset.

To mark the millennium, Caro worked with British architects Foster + Partners and engineers Arup to design the Millennium Bridge. The bridge opened in June 2000 and 100,000 people crossed it in the first weekend, causing more lateral movement than expected. As a result, extensive research was undertaken into the cause - synchronised pedestrian footfall - resulting in changes to codes for bridge building worldwide.

In the early 2000s, his work featured nearly life-size equestrian figures built from fragments of wood and terra cotta on gymnasts&#x27; vaulting horses. In 2008, Caro opened his &quot;Chapel of Light&quot; installation in the Saint Jean-Baptiste Church of Bourbourg (France), and exhibited four figurative head sculptures at the National Portrait Gallery, London. In 2011 the Metropolitan Museum of Art installed five works by Caro on their rooftop. As of 2012, Caro was working on an immense, multipart sculpture that would occupy three blocks of Midtown Park Avenue.

===Teaching===

Caro was also a tutor at Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art in London, inspiring a younger generation of British abstract sculptors, led by former students and assistants including Phillip King, Tim Scott, William G. Tucker, Peter Hide, and Richard Deacon; as well as a reaction group including Bruce McLean, Barry Flanagan, Richard Long, David Hall and Gilbert &amp; George. He and several former students were asked to join the seminal 1966 show at the Jewish Museum in New York entitled, &quot;Primary Structures&quot; representing the British influence on the &quot;New Art&quot;. Caro taught at Bennington College from 1963 to 1965, along with painter Jules Olitski and sculptor David Smith.

===Architecture and design===
Caro also collaborated with celebrated architects, notably Frank Gehry, with whom he constructed a wooden village in New York in 1987. With Norman Foster and the engineer Chris Wise, he designed the London Millennium Footbridge spanning the Thames between St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and the Tate Modern.

==Exhibitions==

Since the 1950s, Caro&#x27;s work has been shown in museums and galleries worldwide.

His first solo exhibition was at the Galleria del Naviglio in Milan in 1956, and his first solo show in London was at the Gimpel Fils Gallery the next year. Another solo show was a pivotal exhibition at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in 1963. In 1967 Caro began exhibiting regularly with Kasmin in London, and in 1969, he began showing with André Emmerich in New York. In the same year he showed at the São Paulo Biennale with John Hoyland. In 2004, to honour his 80th birthday, Tate Britain and Kenwood House held exhibitions of his work.

Caro&#x27;s museum exhibitions include &quot;Anthony Caro: A Retrospective&quot; at the Museum of Modern Art, New York (1975, travelled to Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and Museum of Fine Arts, Boston); &quot;Anthony Caro&quot;, Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo (1995); &quot;Anthony Caro&quot;, Tate Britain, London (2005); three museums in Pas-de-Calais, France (2008), to accompany the opening of his Chapel of Light at Bourbourg; and &quot;Anthony Caro on the Roof&quot;, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (2011). In 2012 the Yale Center for British Art presented &quot;Caro: Close Up&quot;.

From 1 June to 27 October 2013 in connection with the 55th Venice Biennale, he exhibited at the Museo Correr, Venice, Italy. The exhibit was on at the time of his death.

==Recognition==
Caro was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1969 New Year Honours. He was knighted in the 1987 Birthday Honours and received the Order of Merit in May 2000. He was awarded many prizes, including the Praemium Imperiale for Sculpture in Tokyo in 1992 and the Lifetime Achievement Award for Sculpture in 1997.

==Personal life==
In 1949, Caro married the painter Sheila Girling and they had two sons together: Timothy (born 1951), a zoologist; and Paul (born 1958), a painter.

==Death==
Caro was 89 when he died of a heart attack on 23 October 2013. He was lauded as a &quot;gentle man with a pioneering spirit&quot; by BBC arts editor Will Gompertz and &quot;one of the greatest sculptors in the second half of the twentieth century&quot; by Royal Academy of Arts chief executive Charles Saumarez Smith. He is buried in the churchyard of Worth Matravers, Dorset.

<text>Papilio zelicaon, the anise swallowtail, is a common swallowtail butterfly of western North America. Both the upper and lower sides of its wings are black, but the upper wing has a broad yellow stripe across it, giving the butterfly an overall yellow appearance. There are striking blue spots on the rear edge of the rear wing, and the characteristic tails of the swallowtails. Its wingspan is 52–80 mm (2.04-3.15 inches). Its body is somewhat shorter than the rather similar western tiger swallowtail, with which its range overlaps; it also lacks the black stripes, converging toward the tail, of the latter. There is a somewhat darker subspecies, &quot;P. z. nitra&quot;, which is rare throughout the range, though somewhat more often found at lower elevations.

==Description==
The anise swallowtail has a wingspan ranging from . Wings are mostly yellow, with black bands along the edges of both the forewings and hindwings. They are distinguished from tiger swallowtail butterflies by being smaller in size and lacking the vertical black striping patterns. There are yellowish-orange to red eyespots near the tails of each wing, each containing a black pupil. The body is predominantly black, with yellow stripes running laterally along the abdomen.
==Distribution==
The anise swallowtail is a butterfly of fairly open country, and is most likely to be seen on bare hills or mountains, in fields or at the roadside. It is often seen in towns, in gardens or vacant lots.

The usual range of the anise swallowtail extends from British Columbia and North Dakota at its northern extreme, south to the Baja California Peninsula and other parts of Mexico.

It is occasionally reported from the southeastern United States, but its normal range does not extend east of New Mexico. In all the more northerly parts of the range, the chrysalis hibernates.

==Life cycle==

Adult females lay eggs singly on the undersides of host plant leaves. In the first two instars, the caterpillar is dark brown, almost black, with an irregular white band at its middle. After that, it becomes more green at each successive molt until, in the fifth (last) instar, it is predominantly green, with markings in black, orange, and light blue. Its major food plants are members of the carrot family, Apiaceae (including fennel), and also some members of the citrus family, Rutaceae. Like all swallowtail caterpillars, if disturbed, it will suddenly evert bright orange osmeteria (or &quot;stinkhorns&quot;) from just behind its head, glandular structures which give off a foul odor. The caterpillar grows to around 5 cm in length before forming a chrysalis, which is brown or green and about 3 cm long.

The anise swallowtail pupa looks like a thick branch coming off of the larval host plant. The top of the pupa extends slightly from the plant, held by strong silk. This is where the adult butterfly emerges.

<text>The Bengal bush lark (Plocealauda assamica) or Bengal lark is a species of lark in the family Alaudidae found in southern Asia.

== Taxonomy and systematics ==
The Bengal bush lark was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Mirafra&quot;. It is one of five species moved to a newly erected genus, &quot;Plocealauda&quot;, based on evidence from a large molecular genetic study published in 2023. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

The Bengal bush lark was earlier classified into several races, the Bengal race &quot;assamica&quot; and the Madras race &quot;affinis&quot;. These were subsequently split, on the basis of diagnostic song and display characters, into the Jerdon&#x27;s bush lark (&quot;Mirafra affinis&quot;) and &quot;assamica&quot; in the strict sense. Formerly, both the Burmese bush lark and Jerdon&#x27;s bush lark were considered subspecies of the Bengal bush lark (as &quot;M. a. microptera&quot; and &quot;M. a. affinis&quot; respectively) until split to form a separate species. The alternate name &quot;rufous-winged bush lark&quot; may also be used to describe the red-winged lark. Another alternate name for the Bengal bush lark is the rufous-winged lark.

== Description ==
The Bengal bush lark is short-tailed and has a strong stout bill. It is not as long as the skylark, measuring about 15 centimetres in length. It is dark-streaked grey above, and buff below, with spotting on the breast and behind the eye. The wings are rufous.

The song is a repetition of thin disyllabic notes, delivered in a song-flight.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The Bengal bush lark is a resident breeder in the Indian subcontinent and south-east Asia, and found in the countries of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar and Nepal, with an estimated global extent of occurrence of 100,000-1,000,000 square kilometres.

It is a common bird of dry, open, stony country often with sparse shrubs, and cultivated areas.

==Behaviour and ecology==
It nests on the ground, laying three or four speckled eggs. This lark feeds primarily on seeds and insects, especially the latter during the breeding season.

<doc id="680955" wikidata="Q128038" url="?curid=680955" title="Palouse">
<text>The Palouse ( ) is a distinct geographic region of the northwestern United States, encompassing parts of north central Idaho, southeastern Washington, and, by some definitions, parts of northeast Oregon. It is a major agricultural area, primarily producing wheat and legumes. Situated about north of the Oregon Trail, the region experienced rapid growth in the late 19th century. 

The Palouse is home to two land-grant universities: the University of Idaho in Moscow and Washington State University in Pullman. Just eight miles (13 km) apart, both schools opened in the early 1890s.

==Geography and history==

The origin of the name &quot;Palouse&quot; is unclear. One theory is that the name of the Palus tribe (spelled in early accounts variously as Palus, Palloatpallah, Pelusha, etc.) was converted by French-Canadian fur traders to the more familiar French word , meaning &quot;land with short and thick grass&quot; or &quot;lawn.&quot; Over time, the spelling changed to Palouse. Another theory is that the region&#x27;s name came from the French word and was later applied to its indigenous inhabitants.

Traditionally, the Palouse region was defined as the fertile hills and prairies north of the Snake River, which separated it from Walla Walla County, and north of the Clearwater River, which separated it from the Camas Prairie, extending north along the Washington and Idaho border, south of Spokane, centered on the Palouse River. This region underwent a settlement and wheat-growing boom during the 1880s, part of a larger process of growing wheat in southeast Washington, originally pioneered in Walla Walla County south of the Snake River.

While this definition of the Palouse remains common today, the term is sometimes used to refer to the entire wheat-growing region, including Walla Walla County, the Camas Prairie of Idaho, the Big Bend region of the central Columbia River Plateau, and other smaller agricultural districts such as Asotin County, Washington, and Umatilla County, Oregon. This larger definition is used by organizations such as the World Wide Fund for Nature, who define the Palouse Grasslands ecoregion broadly.

The community of Palouse, Washington, is located in Whitman County, about 7 miles (11 km) west of Potlatch, Idaho.

Nevertheless, the traditional definition of the Palouse region is distinct from the older Walla Walla region south of the Snake River, where dryland farming of wheat was first proved viable in the region in the 1860s. During the 1870s, the Walla Walla region was rapidly converted to farmland, while the initial experiments in growing wheat began in the Palouse region, which previously had been the domain of cattle and sheep ranching. When those trials proved more than successful, a minor land rush quickly filled the Palouse region with farmers during the 1880s. The simultaneous proliferation of railroads only increased the rapid settlement of the Palouse. By 1890 nearly all the Palouse lands had been taken up and converted to wheat farming.

Unlike the Walla Walla Country, which was solidly anchored on the city of Walla Walla, the Palouse region saw the rise of at least four centers, all within several miles of each other: Colfax (the oldest), Palouse, Pullman, and on the Idaho side, Moscow. These four centers, along with at least ten lesser ones, resulted in a diffuse pattern of rural centers, relative to the centralized Walla Walla Country

Cities along the borders of the Palouse, and by some definitions included within it, include Lewiston, Idaho, serving the Camas Prairie farmlands; Ritzville, serving the eastern edge of the Big Bend Country; and Spokane, the region&#x27;s major urban hub. So dominant was Spokane&#x27;s position that it became known as the capital of the Inland Empire, including all the wheat-producing regions, the local mining districts, and lumber-producing forests. Spokane also served as the region&#x27;s main railroad and transportation hub.

By 1910, although local terms like Palouse, Walla Walla Country, Big Bend, Umatilla Country, and Camas Prairie continued to be common, many people of the region began to regard themselves as living in the Inland Empire, the Wheat Belt, the Columbia Basin, or simply Eastern Washington, Oregon, or North Idaho.

===Farming===
Early farming was extremely labor-intensive and relied heavily on human and horse-power. An organized harvesting/threshing team in the 1920s required 120 men and 320 mules and horses. Teams moved from farm to farm as the crops ripened. By this point, the combine had been invented and was in use, but few farmers had enough horses to pull such a machine, which required a crew of 40 horses and six men to operate on level ground. Because of this, use of combines on the Palouse lagged behind use in other farming communities in the United States.

It was only when the Idaho Harvester Company in Moscow began to manufacture a smaller machine that combine harvesting became feasible. By 1930, 90% of all Palouse wheat was harvested using combines.

The next step in mechanization was development of the tractor. As with the combines, the first steam engine and gasoline-powered tractors were too heavy and awkward for use on the steep Palouse hills. The smaller, general use tractors introduced in the 1920s were only marginally used. As a result, by 1930, only 20% of Palouse farmers used tractors. Today, the Palouse region is the most important lentil-growing region in the USA.

== Geology ==
The peculiar and picturesque loess hills which characterize the Palouse Prairie are underlain by wind-blown sediments of the Palouse Loess that covers the surface of over on the Columbia Plateau in southeastern Washington, western Idaho, and northeastern Oregon. The Palouse Loess forms a fine-grained mantle of variable thickness that lies upon either the Miocene Columbia River Basalt Group, non-glacial Pliocene fluvial sediments of the Ringold Formation, or Pleistocene glacial outburst flood sediments that are known informally as the &quot;Hanford formation.&quot; At its thickest, the Palouse Loess is up to thick. It consists of multiple layers of loess separated by multiple well-defined calcrete paleosols and erosional unconformities. The degree of development of individual layers of calcrete together with thermoluminescence and optically stimulated luminescence dating of the loess indicate that each calcrete layer represents a period of thousands to tens of thousands of years of nondeposition, weathering, and soil development that occurred between episodic periods of loess deposition. A consistent sequence of normal-reverse-normal polarity signatures demonstrates that the older layers of loess accumulated between 2 and 1 million years ago. Detailed optically stimulated luminescence dating has shown that the uppermost layer of Palouse Loess accumulated between 15,000 years ago and modern times and the layer of loess underlying it accumulated episodically between about 77,000 and 16,000 years ago. Regional trends in the distribution, thickness, texture, and overall composition of the Palouse Loess indicate that it largely consists of the wind-blown sediments eroded from fine-grained deposits of the Hanford formation that were periodically deposited by repeated Missoula Floods within the Eureka Flats area.

Although superficially resembling sand or other types of dunes, the loess hills of the Palouse are of far different origin. Internally, they lack any evidence of cross-bedding or erosion of interbedded layers of loess and calcrete that characterize dunes formed by moving currents. Instead, these hills consist of alternating layers of loess and calcrete that are more or less concordant with the modern surface of these hills. This layering demonstrates that the Palouse hills loess accumulated from the airfall of wind-silt from suspension. In addition, the ubiquitous homogenization of the loess by innumerable plant roots and insect burrows as it accumulated further supports the conclusion drawn from numerous thermoluminescence and optically stimulated luminescence dates that individual layers of loess accumulated over an extended period of time in terms of thousands of years. Finally, the calcrete horizons are paleosols that represent the periodic cessation of loess accumulation for periods of thousands of years during which they formed within the surface of a loess layer.

==Environment==

Once an extensive prairie composed of mid-length perennial grasses such as bluebunch wheatgrass (&quot;Agropyron spicatum&quot;) and Idaho fescue (&quot;Festuca idahoensis&quot;), today virtually all of the Palouse Prairie has been plowed or overrun by non-native species such as cheatgrass. The native prairie is one of the most endangered ecosystems in the United States (Noss et al. 1995), as only a little over one percent of the original prairie still exists. The only large preserved patches of this ecosystem left are found in Hells Canyon National Recreation Area and in the southern portion of Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area.

Riparian areas offer breeding habitat for a greater diversity of birds than any other habitat in the U.S. (Ratti and Scott 1991). Loss of trees and shrubs along stream corridors means fewer birds and eventually fewer species. The majority of riparian areas have been lost across the bioregion.

Lately, conversion of agricultural lands to suburban homesites on large plots invites a new suite of biodiversity onto the Palouse Prairie. University of Idaho wildlife professor J. Ratti documented changes in bird community composition over a 10-year period as he converted a wheat field into a suburban wildlife refuge. As of 1991, his yard attracted 86 species of birds, an increase from 18 (Ratti and Scott 1991).

===Ecological transformation===
As population grew, towns and cities appeared changing the complexion of the area. By 1910, there were 22,000 people scattered in 30 communities across the Palouse Prairie.

Intensification of agriculture has affected both water quantity and quality. Agriculture has changed the hydrology, increasing peak runoff flows and shortening the length of runoff. The result is more intense erosion and loss of perennial prairie streams. As early as the 1930s soil scientists were noting significant downcutting of regional rivers (Victor 1935) and expansion of channel width. Higher, faster runoff caused streams to downcut quickly, effectively lowering the water table in immediately adjacent meadows. On the South Palouse River, this process was so efficient that by 1900 farming was possible where it had been too wet previously (Victor 1935). Replacement of perennial grasses with annual crops resulted in more overland flow and less infiltration, which translates at a watershed level to higher peak flows that subside more quickly than in the past. Once perennial prairie streams are now often dry by mid-summer. This has undoubtedly influenced the amphibious and aquatic species.

Crop production increased dramatically (200–400%) after the introduction of fertilizer following World War II.

Since 1900, 94% of the grasslands and 97% of the wetlands in the Palouse ecoregion have been converted to crop, hay, or pasture lands. Approximately 63% of the lands in forest cover in 1900 are still forested, 9% are grass, and 7% are regenerating forestlands or shrublands. The remaining 21% of previously forested lands have been converted to agriculture or urban areas.

The impacts of domestic grazers on the grasslands of the Palouse and Camas Prairies was transitory because much of the areas were rapidly converted to agriculture. However, the canyonlands of the Snake and Clearwater rivers and their tributaries with their much shallower soils, steep topography, and hotter, drier climate, were largely unsuitable for crop production and were consequently used for a much longer period by grazing domestic animals (Tisdale 1986). There, intense grazing and other disturbances have resulted in irreversible changes with the native grasses largely replaced by annual grasses of the genus Bromus and noxious weeds, particularly from the genus Centaurea. The highly competitive plants of both of these genera evolved under similar climatic regimes in Eurasia and were introduced to the U.S. in the late 19th century.

With the adoption of no-till farming practices in the Palouse region in the early 2000s, the negative environmental impact of agriculture has visibly decreased.

=== Fauna ===
The Palouse boasts a large number of animal species. Some animals in the region include both mule and white-tailed deer, coyotes, bobcats, California quails, yellow-bellied marmots, and red-tailed hawks.

While there is some debate over how frequently the Palouse prairie burned historically, there is consensus that fires are generally less frequent today than in the past, primarily due to fire suppression, construction of roads (which serve as barriers to fire spread) and conversion of grass and forests to cropland (Morgan et al. 1996). Historians recount lightning-ignited fires burning in the pine fringes bordering the prairies in late autumn, but the extent to which forest fires spread into the prairie or the converse is not known. Some fire ecologists believe the Nez Perce burned the Palouse and Camas Prairies to encourage growth of Camas (Morgan, pers. comm.); but there is little historical record to solve the mystery. European-American settlers used fire to clear land for settlement and grazing until the 1930s. Since then, forest fires have become less common. One result has been increasing tree density on forested lands and encroachment of shrubs and trees into previously open areas. Consequently, when fires occur in the forest, they are more likely to result in mixed severity or stand replacing events.

<doc id="680961" wikidata="Q5529731" url="?curid=680961" title="Gedunk bar">
<text>A Gedunk bar or geedunk bar ( ) is the canteen or snack bar of a large vessel of the United States Navy or the United States Coast Guard. The term in this sense was first recorded in &quot;Leatherneck Magazine&quot; in 1931. A service member who works in the geedunk is traditionally referred to only as that &quot;geedunk guy&quot; or &quot;geedunk girl&quot;, or more informally as a &quot;geedunkaroo&quot;. The term was popular during World War II.

== Overview ==

The origin of the word is uncertain. One theory suggests the name is derived from the &quot;gee-dunk&quot; sound that vending machines made when operated. Another theory is that the term is derived from the comic strip Harold Teen, in which Harold eats Gedunk sundaes, chocolate ice cream with ladyfingers &quot;ge-dunked&quot; into it, at the local soda shop. Navy ships would also then have soda shops rather than bars, as the Navy has been bone-dry afloat since alcohol was banned by Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels in 1911. Yet another theory suggests that the word&#x27;s origin is from a Chinese word meaning &quot;place of idleness&quot;.

The gedunk bar was usually open for longer hours than the mess. Such bars were stocked with a wide variety of consumables such as snacks, soft drinks and fresh coffee. In the 21st century, sailors and Marines continue to call a place where snacks are for sale a &quot;gedunk bar&quot; or &quot;gedunk machine&quot; and refer to the snacks themselves as &quot;gedunk&quot;.

In modern times, the gedunk is usually a spare room or space in a unit&#x27;s location, where there are refrigerators and shelves to hold cold drinks and snacks. Some gedunks have coffee pots, hot soup and occasionally barbecues. Items range in price from $.25 to a few dollars. Gedunks are stocked by purchasing bulk food items from grocery stores or warehouse stores such as Costco, not items taken from official supply chains. Profits from gedunk sales are minor, but usually go toward unit functions, such as the Marine Ball. 

During the Vietnam War, all who served honorably in the U.S. armed forces were awarded the National Defense Service Medal. Because the medal was issued regardless of any length of service during the specified period (i.e., graduating from boot camp), it was called a &quot;Gedunk medal&quot;.

<doc id="680973" wikidata="Q6621109" url="?curid=680973" title="List of former Disneyland attractions">
<text>Disneyland is a theme park in Anaheim, California conceived by Walt Disney. This is a list of attractions – rides, shows, shops and parades – that have appeared at the park but have permanently closed. Character meets and atmosphere entertainment (e.g., roving musicians) are not listed. Also not listed are permanently closed attractions from Disney California Adventure.

==Main Street, USA==

* Hollywood-Maxwell&#x27;s Intimate Apparel Shop (1955–1956): Featuring the &quot;Wizard of Bras&quot;
* Maxwell House Coffee House (1955–1957)
* Main Street Shooting Gallery (1955–1962): A shooting gallery themed to the 1920s
* Main Street Flower Market (1955–1977): A large display of plastic flowers: &quot;The world&#x27;s finest natural flowers not grown by nature&quot;
* Disneyland Branch of Bank of America (1955–1993): A Bank of America with three ATMs to use
* Story Book Shop (1955–1995): A book shop operated by Western Publishing
* Babes in Toyland Exhibit (1961–1963): Utilizing the sets from the movie of the same name, this walk-through attraction occupied the Opera House near the park&#x27;s entrance.
* Legacy of Walt Disney (1970–1973): A museum showing exhibits on how Walt Disney changed the world
* Disneyland Presents a Preview of Coming Attractions (1973–1989): A preview center for up-coming attractions
* Bank of Main Street U.S.A. (1993–2005)
* Annual Passholder Center (2005–2009)

===Main Street Opera House shows===
The Main Street Opera House has housed the following shows:
* Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln (1965–1973): Theater presentation featuring an Audio-Animatronic Abraham Lincoln, and a replica of a similar attraction at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. Elements of the original show were incorporated into later versions of the attraction from 1975 to 2004 and from 2009–present.
* The Walt Disney Story (1973–1975): Biographical film about Walt Disney, which originally appeared at Walt Disney World in 1972.
* The Walt Disney Story featuring Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln (1975–2004): A combination of the two previous shows. Disneyland had been criticized for replacing the Lincoln tribute with a tribute to Walt Disney, and combined elements of the two shows in response. From 2001 to 2004 the Disney tribute was removed, and the entire show was given more of a focus on the American Civil War.
* (2005–2009): An exhibition on the history of Disneyland, including a film narrated by Steve Martin.

==Adventureland==

* Tahitian Terrace (1962–1993): Dinner show with various Polynesian entertainment. Replaced by:
:* Aladdin&#x27;s Oasis (1993–1995, 1997–2008): Dinner show based on the 1992 film &quot;Aladdin&quot;. The dinner show ended in 1995 and the stage show was brought back in 1997–2008.
* Big Game Safari Shooting Gallery (1962–1982): A jungle-themed shooting gallery with images of wild animals as the targets.
* Swiss Family Treehouse (1962–1999): A Treehouse walk-through attraction based on the film &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot;. Rethemed as Tarzan&#x27;s Treehouse in 1999.
:* Tarzan&#x27;s Treehouse (1999–2021): A Treehouse walk-through attraction based on the 1999 film, &quot;Tarzan&quot;. Rethemed to Adventureland Treehouse in 2023.

==New Orleans Square==

* The Disney Gallery (1987–2007): A gallery of Disney-related art. The Disney Gallery was the only area listed on Disneyland maps as both an attraction and a retail location. The Gallery sometimes featured preliminary artwork and sketches from certain attractions or movies, sometimes (as in the 100 Mickeys exhibit) the displayed art was associated only with Disney and not with any specific attraction, film, or event. Often, prints from the exhibit were available for purchase via the print-on-demand system, and the Gallery always featured items such as books about Disney artwork. The Gallery used to sell prints of the ride posters featured in the tunnels leading to and from Main Street. The former gallery was replaced by the Disneyland Dream Suite. In October 2009 the gallery re-opened, but now it resides on Main Street, U.S.A.
* Disneyland Dream Suite (2008–2014): A 2,200-square-foot (200 m2) luxury apartment. It was created as part of the &quot;Year of a Million Dreams&quot; promotion that ran from October 1, 2006, through December 31, 2008.

==Frontierland==

* Golden Horseshoe Revue (1955–1986): A musical comedy show featuring Sluefoot-Sue (Betty Taylor), an Irish Tenor (Fulton Burley) and a traveling Salesman (Wally Boag) along with Can-Can girls. An extremely popular show, it ran in the Golden Horseshoe Saloon nearly unchanged for about three decades.
* Golden Horseshoe Jamboree (1986–1994): An Old West show featuring singing, dancing, joke-telling, banjo playing, and general fun and rowdiness, starring Miss Lilly, Sam the Bartender and a gang of cowpunchers.

* All-New Woody&#x27;s Roundup (1999–2000): A live-action show featuring characters from &quot;Toy Story&quot;. 
* Billy Hill and the Hillbillies (1994–2014): A live-action show featuring singing and comedy. In 2012 the musical/variety group moved to Big Thunder Ranch until their show was retired in early 2014. Afterward, they were hired by Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm as Krazy Kirk and the Hillbillies.
* Davy Crockett Museum (1955–1956): Mostly given over to retail space, with a few exhibits detailing scenes from the television series of the same name. 
* Pack Mules (1955–1956): Real mules which were ridden in a line to view simulated frontierlands and deserts. After renovations and upgrades, the ride was renamed:
:* Rainbow Ridge Pack Mules (1956–1959)
:* Pack Mules Through Nature&#x27;s Wonderland (1960–1973); in 1973, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad and Big Thunder Ranch replaced Nature&#x27;s Wonderland.
* Stage Coach (1955–1956): A real stagecoach drawn by real horses. After new scenic landscaping, it became Rainbow Mountain Stage Coaches (1956–1960).
* Conestoga Wagons (1955–1960): A real Conestoga wagon drawn by real animals.
* Rainbow Caverns Mine Train (1956–1959): A narrow gauge mine train attraction through the new &quot;Living Desert&quot;. After the scenery was again redone in 1960, it was also upgraded and became:
:* Mine Train Through Nature&#x27;s Wonderland (1960–1977): The Big Thunder Mountain Railroad attraction replaced this sedate train ride with a roller coaster version. The only element that remained in place from its scenic vistas was the mighty waterfall tumbling from Cascade Peak into the Rivers of America, visible only from various boat rides around the Rivers. The structure that formed Cascade Peak and its waterfalls was demolished in 1998 after it was found to be suffering structurally from the decades of water that had flowed over it. One of the four locomotives and two cars from the ride remained on a stretch of track where Cascade peak once stood, as a staged wreck scene. The train, however, was removed in early 2010 during the Rivers of America refurbishment. The cacti that were a part of the Living Desert section were mostly relocated to the Magic Kingdom version of Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. Other remnants from Nature&#x27;s Wonderland include the tunnel from Bear Country, the buttes from the Living Desert, the tunnel into Rainbow Caverns (though half-buried in concrete), and the jumping fish seen in Bear Country, all visible on Big Thunder Trail. The animals, however, were buried in concrete as the Imagineers didn&#x27;t know where to place them.
* Mineral Hall (1956–1963): Mineral Hall was a shop located next door to the Rainbow Caverns Mine Train/Mine Train through Nature&#x27;s Wonderland ride. Operated by Ultra-Violet Products, the Mineral Hall featured a free exhibit, which included a mineral display lit by black-light. The shop also sold related gifts and mineral samples. Selling anywhere between 10 and 50 cents, the Disneyland-themed mineral samples were labeled &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Mineral Land – Rocks &amp; Minerals&quot;.
* Indian War Canoes (1956–1971): Now Davy Crockett&#x27;s Explorer Canoes, and part of Critter Country.

* Indian Village (1955–1971): Now Critter Country.
* Big Thunder Ranch (1986–2016): A Western-themed casual area for seeing shows, viewing Disneyland&#x27;s horses on their breaks and days off, and dining at Big Thunder Barbecue which served ribs, chicken, potatoes, beans, and such. The Barbecue remained open for a few more years after the Ranch area became the &quot;Festival of Fools&quot; stage for &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; show. Up until its closing, the area was used for special events, a Petting Zoo, and seasonal attractions. It closed in early 2016 for &quot;Star Wars&quot;: Galaxy&#x27;s Edge.
* Mike Fink Keel Boats (1956–1994, 1996–1997): Shut down due to an accident in 1997 when the &quot;Gullywhumper&quot; boat began rocking side-to-side on a trip on the Rivers of America and capsized. The attraction never returned. The &quot;Gullywhumper&quot;″s sister boat, the &quot;Bertha Mae&quot;, was sold on Disney&#x27;s auctions site. In 2003, the &quot;Gullywhumper&quot; returned to the Rivers of America as a prop and is moored on Tom Sawyer Island, where it is visible from the &quot;Mark Twain&quot; Riverboat, the Sailing Ship &quot;Columbia&quot;, and the Explorer Canoes.
* Little Patch of Heaven Petting Farm (2004–2005): Petting zoo located at Big Thunder Ranch to promote the film &quot;Home on the Range&quot;.

* Country Bear Jamboree (1972–1986): An audio-animatronic show featuring traditional American folk songs sung by a variety of bears and their friends. The content of the show was replaced by Country Bear Vacation Hoedown at the Country Bear Playhouse (1986–2001): Used the same bear figures as Country Bear Jamboree, with new costumes. This is now the site of The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.
* The Mile-Long Bar (1972–1988): A snack bar fashioned like an old-west wooden bar with brass footrail and featuring wall-sized mirrors at either end. Later became Brer Bar and is now the site of the expanded Pooh Corner store (formerly Crocodile Mercantile).
* Teddi Barra&#x27;s Swinging Arcade (1972–2003): Video arcade, now the site of the expanded Pooh Corner store.
*Splash Mountain (1989–2023): A log flume ride based on the animated sequences of Disney&#x27;s 1946 film &quot;Song of the South&quot;. Was rethemed to Tiana&#x27;s Bayou Adventure.

==Fantasyland==

* Mickey Mouse Club Theater (1955–1964): Walk-in theater continuously showing animated Disney films and shorts, similar to the Main Street Cinema. Renamed Fantasyland Theater (1964–1982); not to be confused with the present-day theater). Now the site of Pinocchio&#x27;s Daring Journey.

* Merlin&#x27;s Magic Shop (1955–1983): The original magic shop in the park. A second one on Main Street, U.S.A. opened in 1957 and continues to this day. Steve Martin worked at the store for three years beginning in August 1960. &quot;I knew every nook and cranny of the shop,&quot; he recalled in later years, and credited working there as helping hone his performing skills.
* Skyway to Tomorrowland (1956–1994): This ride, a typical aerial lift ride seen in many parks, traveled from a chalet on the west side of Fantasyland, through the Matterhorn, to a station in Tomorrowland. Cabins hung from cables and ran constantly back and forth between the two lands. The Fantasyland station stood until 2016 – closed to public access – adjacent to the Casey Jr. Circus Train, and was concealed by trees. It was demolished for Star Wars: Galaxy&#x27;s Edge construction. Its support towers were removed and the holes in the Matterhorn through which the ride passed were filled in.
* Junior Autopia (1956–1958): A version of the original Autopia geared towards children. The Junior Autopia featured a guide rail, which the original version of Autopia did not have at the time. The site of the Junior Autopia reopened a year later as the Fantasyland Autopia and is now part of the present-day Autopia.
* Midget Autopia (1957–1966): A version of the original Autopia geared towards young children. After the Midget Autopia closed, the ride was dismantled and sent to Walt Disney&#x27;s hometown of Marceline, Missouri, where it operated for a few years. The site of the Midget Autopia is now the main walkway between It&#x27;s a Small World and the rest of Fantasyland.
* Fantasyland Autopia (1959–1999): A version of the original Autopia, built on the site of the former Junior Autopia. The Fantasyland Autopia was known as the &quot;Rescue Ranger Raceway&quot; and themed to the &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale Rescue Rangers&quot; television series from 1991 to 1993. Its name reverted to &quot;Fantasyland Autopia&quot; afterwards, and operated part-time until it permanently closed in 1999. Its track was combined with the track of the Tomorrowland Autopia to create the present-day Autopia.
* Skull Rock and Pirate&#x27;s Cove (1961–1982): A dining experience themed to Captain Hook&#x27;s pirate ship. Dumbo the Flying Elephant was relocated to the former location of Skull Rock and Pirate&#x27;s Cove and reopened there in 1983.
* Motor Boat Cruise (1957–1991): Simulated experience of navigating waterways in a motor boat. Renamed Motor Boat Cruise to Gummi Glen (1991–1993), based on the &quot;Gummi Bears&quot; television show.
* Videopolis (1985–1995): A nighttime dance club targeted at young adults. Videopolis featured television monitors playing modern music videos and also hosted live musical acts. It also featured its very own snack bar, &quot;Yumz&quot;. Videopolis was converted into an amphitheatre in 1990 and was renamed Fantasyland Theatre in 1995.

==Mickey&#x27;s Toontown==

* Chip &#x27;n Dale&#x27;s Acorn Crawl (1993–1998)
* Goofy&#x27;s Bounce House (1993–2008) (re-themed to Goofy&#x27;s Playhouse)

==Tomorrowland==

* Circarama, U.S.A. (1955–1997), renamed Circle-Vision 360° in 1967: A film presentation showing scenes from around the United States and later China. Guests stood in a large circular room and watched a film projected on nine large, contiguous screens that surrounded them. During its run, the attraction was hosted by American Motors, Bell System, AT&amp;T Corporation, Pacific Southwest Airlines, and Delta Air Lines. In 1998, the theater became the queue for the short-lived Rocket Rods attraction. The building now houses Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters. Shows were:
*: &quot;A Tour of the West&quot; (1955–1959)
*: &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; (1960–1984)

* Space Station X-1 (1955–1960), renamed Satellite View of America in 1958: A circular screen showed America from space.
* Rocket to the Moon (1955–1966): Inside a building under a tall futuristic-looking rocket ship, the audience sat in seats around central viewing screens (top and bottom of the center of the room) so that they could see where they were going as they headed away from Earth and towards other worlds. As actual flight to the Moon became more likely, the ride was refurbished as:
:* Flight to the Moon (1967–1975): A refurbished version of Rocket to the Moon with a mission control pre-show. The ride became obsolete as the United States sent actual crewed flights to the Moon between 1969 and 1972, and it was refurbished as:
:* Mission to Mars (1975–1992): An updated version of Flight to the Moon, simulating spaceflight to Mars instead of the Moon.
: The attraction building is now the site of Pizza Planet, a space-themed restaurant.
* Tomorrowland Boats (1955–1956), renamed Phantom Boats in 1956: The boat engines were unreliable, and this became the first permanent attraction to be removed from Disneyland. Later became the site of &quot;Submarine Voyage&quot;, now &quot;Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage&quot;.
* The World Beneath Us (1955–1960): A CinemaScope film about man&#x27;s quest for energy, featuring an animated diorama of the Earth&#x27;s crust.

* Astro Jets (1956–1964): A rocket-spinner ride originally located between &quot;Submarine Voyage&quot; and &quot;Flight to the Moon&quot;. Astro Jets has undergone the following name and location changes:
:* Tomorrowland Jets (1964–1966): New name for the original attraction after corporate sponsor disagreements. After its closure the original attraction was dismantled and the Carousel of Progress theater was built on the site. The building now houses Star Wars Launch Bay and Super Hero HQ.
:* Rocket Jets (1967–1997): A new version of the same ride, in a new location above the PeopleMover loading platform. The ride&#x27;s mechanical components are now part of the Observatron, a sculpture on the same site that plays music and spins at regular intervals.
: The ride&#x27;s present incarnation is known as Astro Orbitor, located at the entrance to Tomorrowland from Main Street, and debuted in 1998.
* Crane Company Bathroom of Tomorrow (1956–1960)
* Skyway to Fantasyland (1956–1994): Aerial lift ride; see &quot;Skyway to Tomorrowland&quot; in Fantasyland, below. The Tomorrowland station was adjacent to the north side of the Carousel of Progress/America Sings (present-day Innoventions) building and has been demolished.
* Viewliner Train of Tomorrow (1957–1958): &quot;The fastest miniature train in the world&quot; ran alongside the Disneyland Railroad for just over a year, and therefore has the distinction of being the shortest-lived ride in the park&#x27;s history.
* Monsanto House of the Future (1957–1967): A walk-through tour of a plastic house with plastic furnishings and interior and modern appliances such as dishwashers. The house was designed in roughly the shape of a plus sign with high-tech rounded exterior contours, all made from white plastic with large windows. It was outdated almost as soon as it was built. It was anchored to a solid concrete foundation that proved to be so indestructible that, when it was dismantled, the work crew gave up and left some of the support pilings in place and they can still be seen in King Triton&#x27;s Grotto between the Tomorrowland entrance and Fantasyland.

* Submarine Voyage (1959–1998): Riders entered the half-submerged miniature submarines by descending through access hatches at either end of the submarine, sat on tiny fold-down seats, and leaned forward to peer out through portholes on either side of the submarine. The submarines moved around a track in the mermaid lagoon and simulated diving by having bubbles rise around it with the purported captain intoning commands over the loudspeaker (they never really submerged). On the trip, riders saw real-looking and imaginary sea life fastened to rocks or floating in the water, a treasure chest of gold, mermaids and a sea serpent, and passed under icebergs at the &quot;North Pole&quot;. The submarines were originally military gray and named after US Navy nuclear-powered submarines but were repainted high-visibility yellow in the 1980s. The attraction returned as &quot;Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage&quot; in 2007.
* The Art of Animation (1960–1966)
* Flying Saucers (1961–1966): Guests rode in single-rider cars on a cushion of air that were steered by shifting body weight. The air cushion was supplied from below through holes in the floor that opened when the cars passed over. The ride&#x27;s site later became the site of the Tomorrowland Stage, and is now the site of Magic Eye Theater. Luigi&#x27;s Flying Tires at Disney California Adventure was a modern-day version of the Flying Saucers.
* Fashion and Fabrics Through the Ages (1965–1966)
* Tomorrowland Stage (1967–1977): Performance venue for concerts and other stage shows, built on the site of the Flying Saucers. The stage was demolished due to the construction of Space Mountain, and was replaced by Space Stage (1977–1985), a performance venue that served a similar purpose to the Tomorrowland Stage. The stage&#x27;s location is now the site of the Magic Eye Theater.
* General Electric Carousel of Progress (1967–1973): A sit-down show in which the building rotated the audience around a series of stages. The stages had audioanimatronic humans and household appliances showing how appliances and electronics advanced about every 20 years from the turn of the century to the &quot;modern&quot; era of the early 1960s. The audience stopped in front of each stage while the characters joked with each other, described life at the time in history, and demonstrated their kitchen. This ride originated at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair and was installed at Disneyland after the fair closed. In 1974, Carousel of Progress was moved to Florida&#x27;s Walt Disney World, and the show building was used for &quot;America Sings&quot; and &quot;Innoventions&quot;.
* PeopleMover (1967–1995): A scenic, slow-moving ride high-above Tomorrowland that was intended to demonstrate how people could be shuttled around a central urban area without rushing to board individual trains or drive individual cars. It consisted of many dozens of small open-air cars seating up to eight riders, all running continuously on a track above and through the various attractions in Tomorrowland. After the ride was closed, the track sat vacant for two-and-a-half years until the opening of the ill-fated Rocket Rods. The Walt Disney World version is still active in the Magic Kingdom under the name of Tomorrowland Transit Authority.
* Adventure Thru Inner Space (1967–1985): A dark ride that pretended to shrink the rider gradually down to microscopic size within a snowflake, then further to view a water molecule in the flake, then finally to the point where one could see the throbbing nucleus of a single oxygen atom, with electrons zooming all around. The attraction was replaced by Star Tours in 1986 and is now the site of Star Tours: The Adventures Continue.
* America Sings (1974–1988): A sit-down show in the same building using the same stages as Carousel of Progress. Audio-Animatronic animals sang American tunes from different eras. It was described as a &quot;lighthearted journey to Musicland, U.S.A&quot;. After the attraction closed in spring of 1988, most of the singing, dancing animals were recycled into the current &quot;Splash Mountain&quot; attraction. Earlier in 1987, two geese were removed and their outer skins peeled and used in the Star Tours queue as droids. The building sat empty from 1988 to 1998, except for seats, the old stages and some offices. Innoventions occupied the same building until its closure on March 31, 2015.
* Magic Eye Theater (1986–2015): A theater which showed 3-D films. The theater has shown the following films:
:* &quot;Magic Journeys&quot; (1984–1986): A film about children&#x27;s imaginations, originally shown at Space Stage, then Magic Eye Theater.
:* &quot;Captain EO&quot; (1986–1997, 2010–2015): A film starring Michael Jackson about a spaceship captain and his misfit crew battling against an evil queen. The show closed in 1997 due to certain problems with Jackson&#x27;s image, but less than a year after Jackson&#x27;s death in 2009 it was brought back as the &quot;&quot;Captain EO&quot; Tribute&quot; for a &quot;limited engagement&quot;.
:* &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Audience!&quot; (1998–2010): A film that served as a sequel to &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot;, starring Rick Moranis, Marcia Strassman, Eric Idle, and Robert Oliveri.
:The 3-D technology used in the Magic Eye Theater is also used in multiple theaters at Disney California Adventure.
* Tomorrowland Autopia (1955–1999): The original Autopia attraction. At least one other Autopia had existed in some form in Fantasyland since 1956. In 1999, the tracks of the Tomorrowland Autopia and the last version of the Fantasyland Autopia were combined to create the present-day Autopia, which opened in 2000.
* Toy Story Funhouse (1996–1997): A temporary stage show and exhibit themed to the 1995 film &quot;Toy Story&quot;.

* Rocket Rods (1998–2000): A high-speed ride high above Tomorrowland along the former PeopleMover track. The ride&#x27;s queue, which went through the old Circle-Vision theater, showed early Disney films about transportation combined with more recent footage. Rocket Rods was plagued with technical problems that frequently caused the ride to shut down. Its track and station remain standing and unused, and its queue area is now part of Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters.
* The American Space Experience (1998–2003): An exhibit highlighting space exploration in conjunction with NASA&#x27;s 40th anniversary. It occupied the former Premiere Shop location outside of the Circle-Vision 360 theater. Now the site of the Disney&#x27;s Fastpass distribution center for Star Tours: The Adventures Continue and part of the Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters ride.
* Star Tours (1987–2010): Built at the original site for Adventure Through Inner Space, this was Disney&#x27;s first attempt at a motion simulator ride, based on the &quot;Star Wars&quot; film series. It was closed in late July 2010 to allow the area to be remodeled to a new attraction, &quot;Star Tours – The Adventures Continue&quot; which features all new simulators, along with a new story line and other changes, including the film being shown in high-definition 3-D film
* Innoventions (1998–2015): Built inside the Carousel Theater, its focus was to show near-futuristic technologies. The attraction closed on March 31, 2015, once again leaving the Carousel Theater empty.
*Jedi Training Academy (2015–2018)
*Star Wars Launch Bay (2015–2020)

== Tom Sawyer Island ==

* Huckleberry Finn&#x27;s Fishing Pier (1956–1965): Guests were able to rent fishing poles and fish for real Catfish, Bluegill, River Perch and Trout at Catfish Cove. The fish were held in a hidden underwater net pen, and guests could have park staff clean any fish they caught and store them in a refrigerator until they were ready to leave the park. The &quot;take-home&quot; option was discontinued just weeks after the attraction opened, as many guests chose not to have their fish cleaned and refrigerated, instead taking them into the park and on rides in the special &quot;fish totes&quot; provided by staff for use in carrying cleaned and chilled fish home. Many of these guests ended up abandoning their catch in bushes, trash cans, lockers, etc., which, when combined with the California heat, resulted in the smell of dead, rotting fish wafting across the park. Guests continued to be able to practice catch-and-release fishing for some time afterwards, until the attraction was eventually scrapped altogether. The raised stage used for the Fantasmic! show now occupies the space above where the fish pen was once submerged.

==Holidayland==

* Holidayland (1957–1961): Holidayland, the &quot;lost&quot; land of Disneyland, was a recreation area with a separate entrance before being replaced by New Orleans Square. Holidayland featured a baseball diamond, a circus and a picnic area and more resembled a park than a themed land.

<text>Iyengars (also spelt Ayyangar or Aiyengar, pronounced ) are an ethnoreligious community of Tamil-speaking Hindu Brahmins, whose members follow Sri Vaishnavism and the Visishtadvaita philosophy propounded by Ramanuja. Iyengars are divided into two denominations, the Vadakalai and the Tenkalai and live mostly in the Southern Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh. The community belongs to the Pancha Dravida Brahmana classification of Brahmins in India.

== Etymology ==
There are several opinions regarding the etymology of the term &quot;Iyengar&quot;, which is the anglicized form of the Dravidian word &quot;Aiyaṅgār&quot; (, ).

One is that it derives from the Proto-Dravidian word &quot;ayya-gāru&quot; (𑀅𑀬𑀕𑀭𑀼), which became &quot;Ayyangāru&quot; (), and later &quot;Ayengar&quot;. The term &quot;ayya&quot; is the Tamil equivalent of the Sanskrit word &quot;ārya,&quot; (𑀆𑀭𑁆𑀬/आर्य) which in Sanskrit means &quot;noble&quot;. &quot;Gāru&quot; refers to a form of the Pali term &quot;gārava&quot;, and later &quot;gaurava&quot;, meaning respect or esteem.

Another is that the word &quot;ayyangār&quot; was first used by Kandhādai Ramanuja Ayyangār of Tirupati, around 1450 CE.

== History ==

===Common origins===

The Iyengar community traces its philosophical origins to Nathamuni, the first Sri Vaishnava acharya, who lived around 900 CE. He is traditionally believed to have collected the 4,000 works of Nammalvar and other alvars, the poet-saints of Southern India who were intensely devoted to Vishnu on both an emotional and intellectual plane. The belief is that he set this collection - commonly called the &quot;Tamil Prabhandams&quot; - to music, and he introduced the devotional hymns of the alvars into worship, thus mixing their Tamil Veda with the traditional Vedas written in Sanskrit. A scriptural equivalence was accepted by the community that formed from his works. The Sanskrit texts are considered to be metaphysical truth and the Tamil oral variants to be based on human experience of the same. This community became immersed in the dual-language worship in temples where issues of varna were of no concern.

A century or so later, Ramanuja became the principal amongst religious leaders who formalized the efforts of Nathamuni as a theology. Ramanuja developed the philosophy of Visishtadvaita and is described by Harold Coward as &quot;the founding interpreter of Sri Vaisnavite scripture,&quot; while Anne Overzee says that he was a collator and interpreter rather than an original thinker. Although showing originality in his method of synthesizing the Tamil and Sanskrit sources, Ranjeeta Dutta said that the two sets of sources &quot;continued to be parallel to each other and not incorporative&quot; at this time.

Nathamuni and Ramanuja were both Brahmins, while Nammalvar was of the Vellala community. All three men were Tamils, although Ramanuja documented his thoughts in Sanskrit.

=== Schism ===
Ramanuja was initially a proponent of the traditional bhakti philosophy that demanded adherents have a good command of Sanskrit texts and a ritualized approach to life and devotion. This outlook marginalized women and members of the Shudra Varna because they were barred from learning the Sanskrit Vedas. Ramanuja later changed his position and became more receptive to a more inclusive theory. His metaphorical devices suggested that devotion through ritual &quot;earned&quot; salvation but also that salvation was given through the grace of God. Subsequently, some time around the fourteenth century, the Iyengar community divided into two sects. Both sects maintained a reverence for his works but were increasingly divided due to the doctrinal uncertainties evident in them.

The Vadakalai sect is referred to as the &quot;Northern&quot; culture or school, and the Tenkalai sect is the &quot;Southern&quot; culture or school. These cultures reference the perceived prominence given by the sects to the terse style of Sanskrit traditions and the lyrical &quot;Tamil Prabhandams&quot;, respectively. S. M. Srinivasa Chari believes this linguistic differentiation to be overstated. The Vadakalai favour Vedanta Desika as their acharya and the Tenkalai prefer instead the teachings of Manavala Mamuni. Chari notes that the sects share a common allegiance to Nammalvar and Ramanuja. and that their subsequent significant thinkers &quot;wholly accepted the authority and importance&quot; of both linguistic styles. Harold Schiffman says that the linguistic schism reflects wider underlying doctrinal differences between the populist southern school and the social conservatism of the north, with Tamil historically being a language understood by the masses. while Sanskrit was elitist and &quot;caste-bound&quot;.

Vedic philosophy holds that the supreme goal in life is to attain the blissful state of Brahman through moksha, being the process of liberation of the suffering soul from the cycle of reincarnation. Although eighteen points of difference between the two Iyengar sects are generally recognised, being referred to as the &quot;ashtadasa bhedas&quot;, most of these are minor. Abraham Eraly describes a principal difference, being Coward considers this to be &quot;the&quot; difference between the two schools of thought, and Carman says that &quot;... both [sects] accord primacy to divine grace, but one group feels it necessary to insist that there is no human contribution at all to the attainment of salvation.&quot; These variations in interpretation of the nature of &quot;prapatti&quot; – loosely translated &quot;self-surrender to god&quot; – are called &quot;marjara nyaya&quot; and &quot;markata nyaya&quot;, referring to the young of cats and monkeys. They give rise to another naming convention for the two sects, being the &quot;monkey school&quot; and the &quot;cat school&quot;.

Unlike the Vadakalai, the Tenkalai Iyengar sect reject the varna system, and accepted those of lower castes into their temples. The sect was founded by Pillai Lokacharya.

Vadakalai Iyengars believe that it is necessary to offer obeisance/prostration to God multiple times, while Tenkalai Iyengars believe that it is enough if you offer obeisance/prostration to God once. This is the reason why a Vadakalai Iyengar is often seen prostrating four times, while Tenkalai Iyengars are seen prostrating only once.

=== Sectarian rivalry ===
The sectarian rivalry has at times been bitter and, according to Andre Beteille, &quot;aggressive&quot;. Thomas Manninezhath notes an intensification of disputes at the time of Thayumanavar in the eighteenth century and on other occasions legal processes have been used in attempts to settle the control of temples.

=== Relations with other communities ===
&quot;See Also: Criticism of Iyers, Brahminism, Anti-Brahminism, varna-Based Reservations in Tamil Nadu&quot;

Prior to the independence of India, Brahmins had a significant presence in the government posts and education system of Madras province, a part of which is now Tamil Nadu. Since independence, grievances and alleged instances of discrimination by Brahmins in Tamil Nadu are believed to be the main factors which fueled the Self-Respect Movement and marginalised them. This, in combination with the depressed economic and social conditions of non-Brahmins, led the non-Brahmins to agitate and form the Justice Party in 1916, which later became the Dravidar Kazhagam. The Justice Party banked on vehement anti-Hindu and anti-Brahmin propaganda to ease Brahmins out of their privileged positions. Gradually, the non-Brahmin replaced the Brahmin in every sphere and destroyed the monopoly over education and the administrative services which the Brahmin had previously held.

There were also accusations that they were Sanskritists who had a contemptuous attitude towards Tamil language, culture and civilisation. Kamil Zvelebil, a Dravidologist, argues from a study of the history of Tamil literature that this accusation is inaccurate and factually wrong. He notes that the Brahmin was chosen as a scapegoat to answer for the decline of Tamil civilisation and culture in the medieval and post-medieval periods.

== Subgroups ==
=== Hebbar ===
Hebbar Iyengar or Hebbari Srivaishnava is a caste of Hindu Brahmins of Tamil origin whose members follow the Visishtadvaita philosophy propounded by Ramanuja. They are found primarily in the Indian state of Karnataka especially in Southern Districts.

=== Mandayam ===
Mandayam Iyengars are a subgroup of Iyengars, settled in various parts of Karnataka, predominantly Melkote. Mandayam Iyengars also speak a different dialect of Tamil called as Mandayam Tamil. Mandayam Iyengars follow Ramanujacharya and Manavala Mamunigal. Mandyam Iyengars do not celebrate the popular Hindu festival of Diwali in remembrance of the day Tipu Sultan massacred close to 1500 men, women and children of this community on Diwali of 1773 in Srirangapatna.

Chelluru / Selvanallur

Chelluru Iyengars are a subgroup of Tenkalai Iyengars, believed to have migrated from Selvanallur ( a village in banks of Godavari) and settled in and around Madurai as early as 9th Century. Chelluru Iyengars follow Ramanujacharya and Manavala Mamunigal.

== Wedding customs ==

Tamil Brahmin weddings are held to a distinct standard of religious orthodoxy in comparison to the ceremonies of other communities. They consist of age-old traditions, enactments, time-bound customs, as well as practices for securing kinship affiliations for the sacred initiation of the bride into her new family. These are performed in an elaborate fashion that are intended to secure the blessings of both God and one&#x27;s ancestors. A typical Iyengar wedding is made up of the following events:
* Vethalaipakku Exchange of gifts between the bride and groom
* Pandalkal Blessing the wedding venue
* Janavasam Heralding the arrival of the groom and inviting him to the mandapam
* Nischayathartham Commitment to be married is made and announced to all
* Jadhaga Naamagaranam Re-naming of bride
* Nandi or Vratham Anointing the bride and groom
* Kashiyathrai The groom embarks on a mock pilgrimage before the father of the bride requests him to come back to the wedding
* Oonjal The couple exchanges garlands and sit on a decorated swing while ladies sing songs
* Piddishuttal The couple is protected from &#x27;dhrishti&#x27; evil eye
* Kanyadaanam The father gives away the bride
* Mangalya Dharanam The groom ties the sacred &#x27;thaali&#x27; on the bride
* Akshathai The couple is blessed with the showering of coloured rice
* Sesha Homam Lighting of the sacred fire
* Saptapadi The groom and bride take seven steps around the sacred fire
* Nagoli Vasthra The bride&#x27; s family welcomes the son-in-law
* Gruhapravesham The bride is welcomed into her marital home
* Sambandhi Virandhu The wedding is followed by a feast for the new families
* Reception Post-wedding celebrations
* Nalangu The bride and groom play games while the guests sing songs

<text>The Passifloraceae are a family of flowering plants, containing about 750 species classified in around 27 genera.

They include trees, shrubs, lianas, and climbing plants, and are mostly found in tropical regions. The family takes its name from the passion flower genus (&quot;Passiflora&quot;) which includes the edible passion fruit (&quot;Passiflora edulis&quot;), as well as garden plants such as maypop and running pop.

&quot;Passiflora&quot; vines and &quot;Dryas iulia&quot; (among other heliconian butterflies) have demonstrated evidence of coevolution, in which the plants attempted to stop their destruction from larval feeding by the butterflies, while the butterflies tried to gain better survival for their eggs.

The former Cronquist system of classification placed this family in the order Violales, but under more modern classifications systems such as that proposed by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, this is absorbed into the Malpighiales and the family has been expanded to include the former Malesherbiaceae and Turneraceae.

<text>In philosophy, an aporia () is a conundrum or state of puzzlement. In rhetoric, it is a declaration of doubt, made for rhetorical purpose and often feigned. The notion of an aporia is principally found in ancient Greek philosophy, but it also plays a role in modern post-structuralist philosophy, as in the writings of Jacques Derrida and Luce Irigaray, and it has also served as an instrument of investigation in analytic philosophy.

==Philosophy==
In philosophy, an aporia is a philosophical puzzle or a seemingly irresoluble impasse in an inquiry, often arising as a result of equally plausible yet inconsistent premises, i.e., a paradox. It can also denote the state of being perplexed, or at a loss, at such a puzzle or impasse.

===Ancient Greek philosophy===
Plato&#x27;s early dialogues are often called his &#x27;aporetic&#x27; (Greek: ) dialogues, because they typically end in aporia. In such a dialogue, Socrates questions his interlocutor about the nature or definition of a concept, e.g., virtue or courage. Socrates then, through elenctic testing, shows his interlocutor that his answer is unsatisfactory. After a number of such failed attempts, the interlocutor admits he is in aporia about the examined concept, concluding that he does not know what it is. In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Meno&quot; (84a-c), Socrates describes the purgative effect of reducing someone to aporia: it shows someone who merely thought he knew something that he does not in fact know it and instills in him a desire to investigate it.

In Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Metaphysics&quot;, aporia plays a role in his method of inquiry. In contrast to a rationalist inquiry that begins from &quot;a priori&quot; principles, or an empiricist inquiry that begins from a &quot;tabula rasa&quot;, he begins the &quot;Metaphysics&quot; by surveying the various &quot;aporiai&quot; that exist, drawing in particular on what puzzled his predecessors: &quot;with a view to the science we are seeking [i.e., metaphysics], it is necessary that we should first review the things about which we need, from the outset, to be puzzled&quot; (995a24). Book Beta of the &quot;Metaphysics&quot; is a list of the &quot;aporiai&quot; that preoccupy the rest of the work.

In Pyrrhonism, aporia is intentionally induced as a means of producing ataraxia.

===Modern usage===
Contemporary academic studies of the term &quot;aporia&quot; further characterize its usage in philosophical discourses. In &quot;Aporetics: Rational Deliberation in the Face of Inconsistency&quot; (2009), Nicholas Rescher is concerned with the methods in which an aporia, or &quot;apory&quot;, is intellectually processed and resolved. In his Preface, Rescher identifies the work as an attempt to &quot;synthesize and systematize an aporetic procedure for dealing with information overload (of &#x27;cognitive dissonance&#x27;, as it is sometimes called)&quot; (ix). The text is also useful in that it provides a more precise (although specialized) definition of the concept: &quot;any cognitive situation in which the threat of inconsistency confronts us&quot; (1). Rescher further introduces his specific study of the apory by qualifying the term as &quot;a group of individually plausible but collectively incompatible theses&quot;, a designation he illustrates with the following syllogism or &quot;cluster of contentions&quot;:

The aporia, or &quot;apory&quot; of this syllogism lies in the fact that, while each of these assertions is individually conceivable, together they are inconsistent or impossible (i.e. they constitute a paradox). Rescher&#x27;s study is indicative of the continuing presence of scholarly examinations of the concept of aporia and, furthermore, of the continuing attempts of scholars to translate the word, to describe its modern meaning.

Aporia&#x27;s role in modern post-structuralist philosophy, is reflected in the writings of Jacques Derrida and Luce Irigaray, and it has also served as an instrument of investigation in analytic philosophy. Derrida refers to three &quot;aporias&quot;: &quot;the epoche of the rule&quot;, &quot;the ghost of the undecidable&quot;, and &quot;the urgency that obstructs the horizon of knowledge&quot;.

==Rhetoric==
Aporia is also a rhetorical device whereby the speaker expresses a doubt—often feigned—about their position or asks the audience rhetorically how the speaker should proceed. One aim of aporia may be to discredit the speaker&#x27;s opponent. Aporia is also called &quot;dubitatio&quot;. For example:

<doc id="680990" wikidata="Q74106" url="?curid=680990" title="Nilgiri flowerpecker">
<text>The Nilgiri flowerpecker (Dicaeum concolor) is a tiny bird in the flowerpecker family. Formerly a subspecies of what used to be termed as the [[plain flowerpecker]] although that name is now reserved for &quot;Dicaeum minullum&quot;. Like others of the group, it feeds predominantly on nectar and fruits. They forage within the canopy of forests and are found in India. They are non-migratory and the widespread distribution range includes several populations that are non-overlapping and morphologically distinct, some of which are recognized as full species. They are important pollinators and dispersers of mistletoes in forests.

==Description==

These birds are tiny (9 cm long) and there is no marked difference between the males and females. It is found in hill forests of the Western Ghats and Nilgiri hills of southern India. It is pale brown on the upperside and the underside is whitish. The whitish brow in front of the eye is wider than in &quot;Dicaeum erythrorhynchos&quot;. This subspecies has been raised to full species by Pamela Rasmussen. The subspecies found in northeastern India, extending into Myanmar, Laos and southern China is called &quot;olivaceum&quot; by earlier authors but is treated by Rasmussen and other taxonomists now as a separate species &quot;Dicaeum minullum&quot; (which includes the population &quot;minullum&quot; from Hainan Island and is now termed as the plain flowerpecker in the more restricted sense). This is very olive above and the black bill is finer and slightly curved. The population found in the Andaman Islands &quot;virescens&quot; is also considered a separate species &quot;Dicaeum virescens&quot; (the Andaman flowerpecker) in the newer treatment. This is bright olive-green on the upperside with dark speckling on the crown. The centre of the belly has a bright patch of pale yellow.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The Nilgiri flowerpecker is a common resident breeding bird of woodland edges, cultivation and isolated stands of trees, often in hilly country. The call of the Nilgiri flowerpecker is a sharp &quot;check&quot; or a rapid series of ticks, while the song is a high-pitched trill. The breeding season of &quot;concolor&quot; in the Nilgiris is January to April possibly with a second brood in May and June. Two or three eggs are laid in a purse-like nest suspended from a tree or bush. Like other flowerpeckers they have a feathery tongue that allows them to sip nectar, but they feed on soft berries as well as small insects.

They are important pollinators and dispersers of mistletoes in tropical forests.

<doc id="680994" wikidata="Q905044" url="?curid=680994" title="Dicaeum">
<text>Dicaeum is a genus of birds in the flowerpecker family Dicaeidae, a group of passerines tropical southern Asia and Australasia from India east to the Philippines and south to Australia. The genus &quot;Dicaeum&quot; is closely related to the genus &quot;Prionochilus&quot; and forms a monophyletic group.

Its members are very small, stout, often brightly coloured birds, 10 to 18 cm in length, with short tails, short thick curved bills and tubular tongues. The latter features reflect the importance of nectar in the diet of many species, although berries, spiders and insects are also taken.

2-4 eggs are laid, typically in a purse-like nest suspended from a tree.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Dicaeum&quot; was introduced by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1816. The name is from the Ancient Greek &quot;dikaion&quot;. Cuvier claimed that this was a word for a very small Indian bird mentioned by the Roman author Claudius Aelianus but the word probably referred instead to the scarab beetle &quot;Scarabaeus sacer&quot;. The type species was designated as the scarlet-backed flowerpecker by George Robert Gray in 1840.

The genus contains the following 51 species:
* Golden-rumped flowerpecker (&quot;Dicaeum annae&quot;)
* Thick-billed flowerpecker (&quot;Dicaeum agile&quot;)

<text>Thai art refers to a diverse range of art forms created in Thailand from prehistoric times to the present day, including architecture, sculpture, painting, textiles, decorative arts, crafts, ceramics, and more. While Buddhism has played a significant role in Thai art, with many sculptures and paintings depicting Buddha images and religious themes, nature, including flora and fauna, as well as mythical creatures, has been a major inspiration for Thai art, with colorful motifs appearing in various types of art forms. In contemporary Thai art, traditional works remain significant and continue to influence artists&#x27; concepts.

==History==
===Prehistory===

One of the earliest examples of artistic expression in Thailand can be found in over 410 documented rock art sites across the country, featuring both prehistoric and historic art. The majority of these sites showcase monochrome red pictograms that depict animals, humans, geometric shapes, and handprints. While the dating of many sites remains unknown, some rock art sites have been reported to date back 3,000–5,000 years ago.

&quot;Nong Ratchawat&quot;, situated in Suphanburi province, is an important prehistoric site that provides valuable insights into the lifestyles of the people who settled in the area around 2000–500 BCE. Excavations have unearthed evidence of rice cultivation, animal husbandry, hunting, fishing, building construction, the creation of polished stone axes and pottery using locally available materials. The inhabitants were skilled in weaving textiles from plants possessing strong fibers, such as flax, hemp, and ramie. During the Iron Age, &quot;Nong Ratchawat&quot; became a prominent trading hub in the Mae Klong River Basin and the Tha Chin River Basin, attracting merchants from different parts of the world and leading to cultural and ethnic diversity. The river watersheds surrounding the site have yielded a plethora of artifacts, including pottery, bronze and iron tools, glass beads, ivory dice, Roman coins, and Lingling-o earrings. Ban Chiang is another important archaeological site in Thailand, located in Udon Thani province. It showcases the artistic achievements of a prehistoric culture that existed from about 2000 BCE to 300 CE. The people of Ban Chiang were skilled metalworkers, and evidence of early metallurgy, including copper and bronze artifacts, has been found at the site. The site also features diverse ceramics, some of which are decorated with distinctive red-on-buff swirl designs painted by hand.
===Dvaravati art===

The Dvaravati period, lasting from the 6th to the 12th centuries CE, witnessed the spread of Theravada Buddhism throughout central, northern, northeastern, and southern Thailand. While Theravada Buddhism was the dominant religion during this time, there is also evidence of other religious influences, including Mahayana Buddhism and Hinduism. Dvaravati art, which employed hard blue limestone or quartzite to produce intricate sculptures, stucco, and terracotta decorations, featured symmetrical Buddha images standing or seated on thrones and the Wheel of the Law. The art style of Dvaravati owed its influence to the art of the Gupta and Post-Gupta periods in northern India, as well as the Buddhist art of Amaravati in southern India. People of Dvaravati were likely the Mons, as evidenced by various inscriptions during this period. The Dvaravati period played a significant role in the dissemination of Buddhism across the region, with noteworthy examples of Dvaravati towns including Nakhon Pathom ancient city in Nakhon Pathom province, U-Thong in Suphanburi province, Chan Sen in Nakhon Sawan province, Si Thep in Phetchabun province, Hariphunchai in Lamphun province, Mueang Fa Daet Song Yang in Kalasin province, Champasi in Maha Sarakham province, Sema in Nakhon Ratchasima province, Baan Dong Lakorn in Nakhon Nayok province, Ku Bua in Ratchaburi province, and Yarang in Pattani province.
===Srivijaya art===
During the 8th-13th centuries CE, Southern Thailand may have been influenced by the Srivijaya Kingdom, which encompassed Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula. This resulted in similarities between Srivijaya art in Southern Thailand and Central Java art in Indonesia, specifically in bronze sculptures and votive tablets. The ancient sites in Chaiya, Southern Thailand, also bear resemblances to Central Java art, with Wat Phra Borommathat Chaiya being the most similar. The majority of sculptures discovered in Southern Thailand are of religious significance, depicting figures such as the Avalokitesvara, Buddha protected by a Nāga, and clay votive tablets with Buddhist iconography. Srivijaya art in Southern Thailand, from Surat Thani to Songkhla, displays the influence of Indian art styles such as Gupta, post-Gupta, and Pala–sena, indicating a strong connection to Mahayana Buddhism.
===Khmer art in Thailand – Lopburi art===
Between the 11th and 13th centuries CE, central and northeastern Thailand was ruled by the Khmers of Cambodia and as a result, Brahmin–Hinduism emerged. It led to the development of artistic styles, sculptures, and architecture similar to the Khmer also known as Khom in Thai language. This artistic expression is known as the Lopburi style, named after the ancient city of Lopburi or Lavo and refers to both the Khmer-influenced and genuinely Khmer artistic movement in Thailand.

Lopburi artists were primarily associated with Brahmin-Hinduism, and later, Mahayana Buddhism. Surviving examples of their art are mainly stone and bronze carvings. The Lopburi architectural style used bricks and stones, with the &quot;Prang&quot; style being the most common, influenced by the Khmer Angkor style. In the 13th century AD, the Sukhothai Kingdom was established, and the Lopburi Kingdom came under its influence. During this time, artistic works aimed to establish a Thai identity.
===U-Thong art===
U-Thong art, also known as Suphannaphum-Ayothaya art, emerged in central Thailand between the 12th and 15th centuries CE, contemporaneously with Chiang Saen and Sukhothai art. This style received its name from the U-Thong Kingdom, which was centered in the U Thong District, although this kingdom&#x27;s existence is ambiguous. It is characterized by a Buddha image style influenced by Dvaravati, Lopburi, and Sukhothai arts, with the Dvaravati influence being the most prominent. The resulting architecture and fine arts are collectively referred to as U-Thong and can be found in various provinces, including Suphanburi, Nakhon Pathom, Chai Nat, Lopburi, and Ayutthaya.

U-Thong architecture is closely related to Theravada Buddhism and features low-roofed ubosot, vihāra, and chedis constructed with wood. A unique style of U-Thong chedi has an octagonal base, eight-sided structure, lotus crystal-adorned roof, and bell. These chedis are commonly found at various temples, such as Sankhaburi in Chai Nat province or some temples in Suphanburi. Another type of U-Thong chedi is found at Wat Phra Borommathat in Chai Nat province and shows similarities to Srivijaya art.

Bronze sculptures from the U-Thong period exemplify elaborate casting, inheriting from the earlier Dvaravati art. Sukhothai art mixed with U-Thong art, resulting in lighter Buddha statues with flame auras, eventually becoming characteristic of early Ayutthaya art. The U-Thong or Ayothaya Kingdom was dissolved with the establishment of the Ayutthaya Kingdom.
===Sukhothai art===
Sukhothai art emerged in the 13th to 15th centuries CE, coincided with the establishment of the Sukhothai Kingdom. This art form was influenced by Theravada Buddhism, which was propagated from Lanka through Nakhon Si Thammarat. One of the most notable characteristics of Sukhothai art is the authentic Sukhothai-style chedi, also referred to as &quot;Phum khao bin&quot;, which has a distinct lotus-shaped design.

Another defining feature of Sukhothai art is the Buddha images&#x27; graceful and elegant form, which exhibits refined proportions, a distinctive flame-like halo around the head, and a serene expression. These Buddha images are typically seated in the half-lotus posture with the right hand performing the earth-touching gesture or walking with one foot forward and the right hand raised to the chest. The walking Buddha, in particular, is a unique style closely associated with Sukhothai.

The Sukhothai Kingdom was also renowned for its exceptional glazed ceramics, which were produced in the Sangkhalok style. These ceramics featured delicate blue-green or grayish-green tints and intricate designs painted in black or a darker hue of the glaze. They were fired at high temperatures, resulting in a durable and robust body. Despite its short-lived existence, the Sukhothai Kingdom&#x27;s artistic legacy remains influential to this day. The kingdom&#x27;s artistry and craftsmanship were absorbed into the Ayutthaya Kingdom, which succeeded it.
===Lanna art===
Lanna art, also known as Chiang Saen art, denotes an artistic tradition that emerged in northern Thailand, spanning the period from the 14th to the 19th century AD. Its inception was in Chiang Saen; however, the establishment of the Lanna Kingdom with Chiang Mai as its capital caused a shift in artistic production. Lanna art is deeply entrenched in Theravada Buddhism, which was the dominant religion in the region. While initially, it drew inspiration from Hariphunchai art, it gradually evolved its distinct style.

Lanna chedis are typically bell-shaped, evolving from a round plan to a polygonal plan as seen in the pagoda at Wat Phra That Doi Suthep. Some chedis, for example, the one containing King Tilokaraj&#x27;s ashes at Wat Chet Yot, were influenced by Sukhothai architecture. The Buddha images of Lanna are frequently depicted with specific attributes like a round face, a smiling expression, and curled-up hair or an egg-shaped face with a halo of flames.
===Ayutthaya art===
Ayutthaya art thrived between the 14th and 18th centuries CE, during the rise and dominance of the Ayutthaya Kingdom across much of mainland Southeast Asia. It inherited the artistic traditions of late U-Thong art and developed a distinctive style that blended various cultural influences from Sukhothai, Lopburi, India, Persia, China, Japan, and Europe. Ayutthaya also exerted its artistic influence over its vassal states of Angkor and Lanna.

The art of Ayutthaya was characterized by a diverse array of techniques and styles, including the grand palaces and monasteries decorated with chedis, prangs, and Buddha images. Religious icons were often adorned with regal attire and crowns, emphasizing the close relationship between the king and the Buddha. Artisans showcased their expertise in the creation of lacquerware and mother-of-pearl inlay, producing functional and decorative objects with intricate designs and vivid paintings. These techniques were frequently used to decorate religious objects such as Buddha images.

&quot;Chang Sip Mu&quot;, which means &quot;Ten Essential Traditional Craftsmanship&quot;, played a crucial role in both civilian and military fief houses during the Ayutthaya period. This is evidenced by its recognition under the Three Seals Law implemented by King Borommatrailokkanat. Despite the name suggesting only ten groups of highly skilled craftsmen, the group actually comprised more than ten groups who were experts in various fields. However, after the Burmese army burned down the city in 1767 CE, various branches of fine arts that had thrived during the late Ayutthaya period had to disperse because craftsmen were taken away. Despite this unfortunate event, the city&#x27;s artistic heritage can still be appreciated today at the archaeological site of the historic city and in various museums.
===Rattanakosin art===
Rattanakosin art is a style of art that emerged in 1780, when the Rattanakosin Kingdom was founded by King Rama I. The king wanted to revive the artistic traditions that had been lost during the destruction of the Ayutthaya Kingdom by the Burmese. He re-established &quot;Chang Sip Mu&quot;, a group of ten craftsmen who were responsible for creating fine art in Bangkok. Later, this group became part of the Fine Arts Department.

The early Rattanakosin art was influenced by the late Ayutthaya art, which was characterized by the use of bright colors, gold leaf, and solid backgrounds in paintings. The artists also restored some of the art forms that had been damaged or lost, such as lacquerware and mother-of-pearl inlay.

During the reign of King Rama III, Rattanakosin art began to incorporate elements from other cultures, such as European and Chinese. This was especially evident in architectural art, which blended Thai and Chinese styles. For example, the Grand Palace and Wat Pho were built with Chinese-style roofs and decorations.

King Rama IV introduced more changes to Rattanakosin art, as he was interested in Western science and culture. He adopted European architectural styles and techniques, such as Gothic and neoclassical, and also learned about linear perspective from Western paintings. He hired Khrua In Khong, a talented painter who applied linear perspective to Thai paintings and created realistic scenes of nature and society.

King Rama V continued the modernization and westernization of Rattanakosin art, as he traveled to Europe and brought back new ideas and materials. He commissioned many buildings that combined Thai and European styles, such as the Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall and the Vimanmek Mansion and mixed-style such as Chakri Maha Prasat Throne Hall. He also supported the production of Benjarong, a type of porcelain with colorful patterns that had previously been imported from China with Thai patterns but later began to be produced locally.
====Contemporary art====
Contemporary Thai art emerged in the 1990s, blending old and new Thai cultural features with a diverse color palette and patterns to create modern and appealing art. However, its roots can be traced back to Khrua In Khong, the first Thai artist to adopt the Western realist style in his paintings, which added more depth and realism to his works.

Silpa Bhirasri, an Italian sculptor who came to Thailand in 1923 and founded the &quot;School of Fine Arts&quot;, which later became Silpakorn University, played a pivotal role in introducing modern art concepts and techniques to Thai artists and students. He taught them perspective, anatomy, composition, and color theory, and established the National Art Exhibition in 1949, providing a platform to showcase and promote Thai art. Silpa Bhirasri&#x27;s famous sculptures and paintings reflected his artistic vision and appreciation of Thai culture and history, making him widely regarded as the father of Thai contemporary art.

Silpa Bhirasri&#x27;s influence can be seen in the works of Fua Haripitak and , who were Thailand&#x27;s avant-gardes in the 1950s and 1960s. These artists challenged the conventional norms and expectations of Thai art by creating abstract and expressive works that explored their personal feelings and experiences. They used bold colors, shapes, and textures to convey their emotions and ideas, incorporating elements of Thai culture and spirituality, such as Buddhist symbols, folk motifs, and astrological signs, into their works. Their trailblazing efforts paved the way for many more artists of later generations, such as Damrong Wong-Upraj, Manit Poo-Aree, Pichai Nirand, and Anant Panin, to experiment with new forms and styles of expression.

In the mid-1990s, a group of artists created the Chiang Mai Social Installation, which brought art and performance out of the traditional gallery setting and into the streets of Chiang Mai.

The Bangkok Art Biennale, launched in 2018, provides a platform for artists to showcase their work on an international stage. These developments reflect a growing interest in Thai contemporary art and the increasing willingness of artists to experiment with new forms of expression

<text>The thick-billed flowerpecker (Dicaeum agile) is a tiny bird in the flowerpecker group. They feed predominantly on fruits and are active birds that are mainly seen in the tops of trees in forests. It is a resident bird with a wide distribution across tropical southern Asia from India east to Indonesia and Timor with several populations recognized as subspecies some of which are sometimes treated as full species.

==Description==

This species flowerpecker is about 10 cm long and has a dark stout beak and short tail. They are dark grey brown above and dull greyish with diffuse streaking on light buffy underparts. The rump is slightly more olive in the nominate race. The bill is dark, somewhat stout and heavy and the iris is reddish. The sexes are not distinguishable in the field and the juvenile has a paler base to the mandible and less streaks on the underside. There are whitish spots at the tip of the tail feathers. The nominate race is found on the plains of the mainland of the Indian Subcontinent. The Sri Lankan population, &quot;zeylonense&quot; (=&quot;zeylonicum&quot;, &quot;zeylonica&quot;), is smaller and darker above. and Subspecies &quot;modestum&quot; (including &quot;pallescens&quot;) is found in northeastern India and extends into Burma. Several island forms have been described but some of them are only tentatively kept within this species. These include &quot;atjehense&quot; of Sumatra, &quot;finschi&quot; of western Java, &quot;tinctum&quot; of Sumba, Flores and Alor, &quot;obsoletum&quot; from Timor, &quot;striatissimum&quot;, &quot;aeruginosum&quot; and &quot;affine&quot; from the Philippines. Several of these such as &quot;aeruginosum&quot; are considered as full species as they are reproductively isolated and distinct in morphology.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Like other flowerpeckers they feed mainly on berries, nectar but sometimes take insects. Many of the subspecies are found in dense lowland forests with the exception of the nominate race which is found mainly in cultivated areas or open forest.

Unlike the pale-billed flowerpecker, it does not swallow the berries of &quot;Loranthus&quot; (some species now in genus &quot;Dendrophthoe&quot;) and instead wipes the seeds on a branch and feeds on the epicarp. This makes it disperse the parasitic mistletoe locally unlike the other species. In Sri Lanka, they forage at a greater height in the canopy than the pale-billed flowerpecker.

Foraging birds produce a &quot;spick&quot; call frequently and the tail is jerked from side to side when perched. When displaying the male twitters and flutters over the female. The song is rambling and is mixed with notes that resemble that of the ashy prinia. The feathers of the crown are erected in display and the white bases of the feathers become visible as a crown stripe.

The nest has been described as appearing camouflaged like a dry leaf. It is a pendant purse like structure made of cobwebs or fine plant fibres and is located from 3 to 15 metres high suspended from a thin horizontal branch. Said to frequently nest among the nests of &quot;Oecophylla smaragdina&quot; ants. The breeding season in southern India is December to March. Both male and female participate in nest building. The usual clutch is about 3 eggs but can vary from 2 to 4. The incubation period is around 13 days and the chick takes around 18 days to fledge.

<text>Hugh Edward Kennedy (11 July 1879 – 1 December 1936) was an Irish judge, politician and barrister who served as Chief Justice of Ireland from 1924 to 1936, a judge of the Supreme Court from 1924 to 1936 and Attorney General of Ireland from 1922 to 1924. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin South constituency from 1923 to 1924. As a member of the Irish Free State Constitution Commission, he was also one of the constitutional architects of the Irish Free State.

==Early life and education==
Kennedy was born in Dublin in 1879. He was the son of the surgeon Hugh Boyle Kennedy and Mary Kate Kennedy (née Kennedy; not related), from County Tipperary. His younger sister was the journalist Mary Olivia Kennedy. He studied for the examinations of the Royal University while a student at University College Dublin and King&#x27;s Inns, Dublin. He was called to the Bar in 1902. He was appointed King&#x27;s Counsel in 1920 and became a Bencher of King&#x27;s Inn in 1922.

He married Clare Murphy (died 1975) in Dublin in 1911. They had no children. She was the daughter of a successful Liverpool Irish timber merchant, John Murphy.

==Legal career==
During 1920 and 1921, Kennedy was a senior legal adviser to the representatives of Dáil Éireann during the negotiations for the Anglo-Irish Treaty. He was highly regarded as a lawyer by Michael Collins, who later regretted that Kennedy had not been part of the delegation sent to London in 1921, to negotiate the terms of the treaty.

On 31 January 1922, Kennedy became the first Attorney General in the Provisional Government of the Irish Free State. Later that year, the Provisional Government appointed him to the Irish Free State Constitution Commission to draft the Constitution of the Irish Free State. The Irish Free State was established on 6 December 1922. The functions of the Provisional Government were transferred to the Executive Council of the Irish Free State. Kennedy was appointed Attorney General of the Irish Free State on 7 December 1922.

In 1923, he was appointed to the Judiciary Commission by the Government of the Irish Free State, on a reference from the Government to establish a new system for the administration of justice by the Constitution of the Irish Free State. The Judiciary Commission was chaired by Lord Glenavy, who had also been the last Lord Chancellor of Ireland. It drafted the Courts of Justice Act 1924 for a new court system, including a High Court and a Supreme Court. It provided for the abolition, &quot;inter alia&quot;, of the Irish Court of Appeal and the Irish High Court of Justice. Most of the judges were not reappointed to the new courts. Kennedy personally oversaw the selection of the new judges and made impressive efforts to select them on merit alone. The results were not always happy: his diary, of which some extracts have been published, reveal the increasingly unhappy atmosphere in the Supreme Court itself, due to frequent clashes between Kennedy and his colleague Gerald Fitzgibbon, since the two men proved to be so different in temperament and political outlook that they found it almost impossible to work together harmoniously. In a similar vein, Kennedy&#x27;s legal opinion and choice of words could raise eyebrows amongst legal colleagues and fury in the Executive Council, for example regarding the Kenmare incident.

He was also a delegate of the Irish Free State to the Fourth Assembly of the League of Nations, between 3 and 29 September 1923.

==Political career==
He was elected to Dáil Éireann on 27 October 1923, as a Cumann na nGaedheal TD at a by-election in the Dublin South constituency. He was the first person to be elected in a by-election to Dáil Éireann. He resigned his seat in June 1924 when he was appointed Chief Justice of Ireland.

==Judicial career==
On 5 June 1924, he was appointed Chief Justice of Ireland, thereby becoming the first Chief Justice of the Irish Free State. He is also the youngest person appointed Chief Justice of Ireland. When he was appointed he was 44 years old. Although the High Court of Justice and the Court of Appeal had been abolished and replaced by the High Court and the Supreme Court respectively. Kennedy campaigned for the replacement of the wigs and gowns traditionally worn by judges and barristers, which he regarded as the trappings of an alien regime. He received little support from the judges or the government and the traditional dress was retained. He held the position of Chief Justice, until his death on 1 December 1936.

In September 2015, a biography by Patrick Kennedy (no relation) was written on him called &quot;Hugh Kennedy: The Great But Neglected Chief Justice&quot;.

<text>Legge&#x27;s flowerpecker (Dicaeum vincens) or the white-throated flowerpecker, is a small passerine bird. It is an endemic resident breeder in Sri Lanka. It is named after the Australian ornithologist William Vincent Legge.

The Legge&#x27;s flowerpecker is a common resident breeding bird of forests and other well-wooded habitats including gardens. Two eggs are laid in a purse-like nest suspended from a tree.

== Description ==
This is a very small passerine but a relatively stout flowerpecker, measuring in total length and weighing approximately , with a short tail, short thick curved bill and tubular tongue. The latter features reflect the importance of nectar in its diet, although berries, spiders and insects are also taken.

The male Legge&#x27;s flowerpecker has blue-black upperparts, a white throat and upper breast, and yellow lower breast and belly. The female is duller, with olive-brown upperparts.

==In culture==

In Sri Lanka, this bird is known as in Sinhala. This bird appears in a one rupee Sri Lankan postal stamp.

<doc id="681037" wikidata="Q7734375" url="?curid=681037" title="The Flash Girls">
<text>The Flash Girls are a now defunct folk music duo based out of Minneapolis, Minnesota. The duo consisted of Emma Bull, a noted science fiction author, and Lorraine Garland, also known as &quot;The Fabulous Lorraine&quot;. Garland is also notable as Neil Gaiman&#x27;s personal assistant; the group formed at a Guy Fawkes Day party at Gaiman&#x27;s home. The connections that both Bull and Garland had with the science fiction and fantasy communities allowed them to have an unusually notable group of people writing songs for and with them, including Jane Yolen, Alan Moore, and Neil Gaiman. These songs are mixed in with their own original works, traditional songs such as Star of the County Down and Lily of the West, as well as poems put to music, including works by Dorothy Parker and A.A. Milne.

The group has three albums, &quot;The Return of Pansy Smith and Violet Jones&quot; (1993), &quot;Maurice and I&quot; (1994), and &quot;Play Each Morning Wild Queen&quot; (2001). Following their second album, the pair split up due to Bull moving to California to pursue screenwriting. Since then, Garland joined the band Folk UnderGround. During their time apart between &quot;Maurice and I&quot; and &quot;Wild Queen,&quot; the duo continued to write material, and in early 2001 Bull flew back to Minneapolis for an intense two-weeks of recording sessions. They intended to perform a concert with the new material, but while the band was setting up for the concert Bull fell and broke both her arms. The Flash Girls did manage to do a few performances in 2001 with a session musician covering Bull&#x27;s guitar parts, but apparently have performed together infrequently since. 

One recent appearance was at ConFusion 2005, aka 31 Flavors of ConFusion, where Bull with Will Shetterly were Author Guests of Honor. ConFusion is held in the Metro Detroit area every January. Garland and Bull performed together, per Steven Brust, ConFusion&#x27;s Toastmaster that year. 

Bull and Garland somehow landed their third-ever gig as the opening band for Warren Zevon to a packed crowd at Minneapolis&#x27; First Avenue Club. They were both extremely nervous, having been together for only a month. Garland said that if they screwed up in front of such a huge crowd, she was going to change her name to Pansy Smith and move into Gaiman&#x27;s basement; in his blog, Gaiman says this was his suggestion. Bull agreed and said she&#x27;d join Garland and change her name to Violet Jones. Although the concert went off without a hitch, the pair adopted these names as their alter egos and made up a fictional history of a female Irish folk duo in the 1920s and used it as a theme for their first record, &quot;The Return of Pansy Smith and Violet Jones.&quot;
Pansy Smith and Violet Jones became characters in the DC Comics series &quot;Sovereign Seven&quot;, where they run a coffee shop.

The group&#x27;s name came from the old Irish slang term &quot;flash,&quot; which means well-dressed and of dubious reputation, or &quot;knowing more than is socially acceptable.&quot; A number of folk songs mention &quot;flash girls,&quot; most notably the one attributed by Bull&#x27;s husband Will Shetterly as being the source for the group&#x27;s name, &quot;House-husband&#x27;s Lament (Rocking the Cradle).&quot; The line in question goes, &quot;Come all you young men with a notion to marry/Oh, pray, won&#x27;t you leave those flash girls alone.&quot;

Both The Flash Girls and Bull&#x27;s former group, Cats Laughing, have been mentioned in Shetterly&#x27;s stories for the fantasy fiction shared universe Borderland.

<doc id="681042" wikidata="Q6548596" url="?curid=681042" title="Lily of the West">
<text>&quot;Lily of the West&quot; is a traditional British and Irish folk song, best known today as an American folk song, it is listed as number 957 in the Roud Folk Song Index and has a Laws Number of P27. The American version is about a man who travels to Louisville and falls in love with a woman named Mary, Flora or Molly, the eponymous Lily of the West. He catches Mary being unfaithful to him, and, in a fit of rage, stabs the man she is with, and is subsequently imprisoned. In spite of this, he finds himself still in love with her. In the original version, the Lily testifies in his defense and he is freed, though they do not resume their relationship.

The lyrics to the first verse, as famously sung by Joan Baez:&quot;When first I came to Louisville, some pleasure there to find&lt;br&gt;A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind&lt;br&gt;Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips, like arrows pierced my breast&lt;br&gt;And the name she bore was Flora, the lily of the West&quot;- and every verse ends with a repetition of the phrase, &quot;Flora, the lily of the West.&quot;

== History and traditional variants ==

=== Britain and Ireland ===
Many broadsides of the song were collected in England and Ireland around 1820–50; the English and Scottish versions generally begin &quot;It&#x27;s when I came to England some pleasure for to find&quot;, whilst the Irish broadsides began &quot;When first I came to Ireland some pleasure for to find&quot;. Sabine Baring-Gould collected several versions from traditional singers in the English West Country in the 1890s, and George Gardiner and Charles Gamblin collected another in Dummer, Hampshire in 1906. The traditional tune is a variant of that also commonly used for the Irish folk song The Lakes of Pontchartrain and it belongs to the same Irish melody-family as a song variously known as On the Trail of the Buffalo / Buffalo Skinners / The Hills of Mexico / The State of Arkansas / Boggus Creek.

Below is the first verse of a version printed in 1857 in Glasgow, Scotland, described as a &quot;highly popular song&quot;:&quot;It&#x27;s when I came to England some pleasure for to find,&quot;

&quot;When I espied a damsel most pleasing to my mind,&quot;

&quot;Her rosie cheeks, and rolling eyes like arrows pierced my breast,&quot;

&quot;And they called her lovely Flora the Lily of the West.&quot;

=== America ===
In &quot;The Collected Reprints from Sing Out! the Folk Song Magazine Volumes 7-12, 1964-1973&quot; (on page 6, preceding the song&#x27;s notation and lyrics), it is stated that:

“This old ballad has been kept alive over the centuries by both print and oral tradition. Originally an English street ballad (or broadside), the song became particularly popular in the United States by parlor singers and ballad-printers. During the 19th century it was known throughout the country and, in time, became part of the folk heritage. Its popularity was such that in Kansas, local versifiers used the song for a parody:&quot;

&quot;Come all you folks of enterprise who feel inclined to roam&lt;br&gt;Beyond the Mississippi to seek a pleasant home;&lt;br&gt;Pray take a pioneer&#x27;s advice, I&#x27;ll point you out the best&lt;br&gt;- I mean the state of Kansas, the lily of the West&quot;The song survived long enough in North America for audio recordings to be made of traditional versions, particularly in the Ozark region of the United States. Recordings collected by Max Hunter and performed by C.W. Ingenthron of Walnut Shade, Missouri (1958) and Fred High of Arkansas (1959) are available online via the Max Hunter Folk Collection. Irene Sargent of West Fork, Arkansas was recorded performing a version in 1960, and Lowell Harness of Leslie, Arkansas was recorded performing another in 1962. The song also had a presence in Appalachia, where Alan Lomax recorded a version performed by Eliza Pace of Hyden, Kentucky in 1937, and Evelyn Ramsey of Sodom Laurel, North Carolina had her version recorded by Mike Yates in 1980. Several Canadian versions were recorded in Newfoundland and Nova Scotia in the 1950s and 60s by Helen Creighton, Herbert Halpert and Kenneth Peacock.

==Popular recordings==

Joan Baez recorded the song in 1961, including it on her second album; her live concerts have frequently included performances of the song well into the 2010s. Bob Dylan, The Chieftains, Bert Jansch - Live At The 12 Bar, Josh Andrews, The Flash Girls, Caroline Groussain, Sheri Kling, Show of Hands, Peter, Paul and Mary (as &quot;Flora&quot;), Mark Knopfler, Crooked Still, Dirty Linen, Branimir Štulić (in Croatian, titled &quot;Usne Vrele Višnje&quot;) and Pat Gubler (PG Six) on the album &quot;Slightly Sorry&quot; (Amish Records 2010) among others. The &quot;Green Mountain Bluegrass Band&quot; does a version of this song as well. Arizona road band Major Lingo performed a long jam version of the song using an electric slide guitar and slightly different lyrics. Holly Near recorded a parody of the song about the lesbian scene in which the singer, a woman, was obsessed with &quot;Lily, the flora of the West.&quot;

==The Irish experience ==

The song is often interpreted as a metaphor for the English, Scots-Irish and general British and Irish experience in western early and colonial America, with nods to their earlier experiences on the margins of Ireland, Scotland, and the Borders.

The first Chieftains recording of the song, from their mid 1990s album &quot;The Long Black Veil&quot; and sung by Mark Knopfler, is set in Ireland. A later recording by The Chieftains and Rosanne Cash from The Chieftains&#x27; album &quot;Further Down the Old Plank Road&quot;, ends with the man&#x27;s being released and traveling across the Atlantic to &quot;ramble through old Ireland/And travel Scotland o&#x27;er&quot;. Despite leaving America, he finds that he is still in love and mentally fixated on the woman, known in this version as Flora.

<text>Hayim Nahman Bialik (; January 9, 1873 – July 4, 1934) was a Jewish poet who wrote primarily in Hebrew and Yiddish. Bialik is considered a pioneer of modern Hebrew poetry, part of the vanguard of Jewish thinkers who gave voice to a new spirit of his time, and recognized today as Israel&#x27;s national poet. Being a noted essayist and story-teller, Bialik also translated major works from European languages.

==Biography==

Hayim Nahman Bialik was born in Radi, Volhynia Governorate in the Russian Empire to Itzik Yosef Bialik, a wood merchant from Zhytomyr, and his wife, Dinah Priveh. He had an older brother Sheftel (born in 1862) and two sisters Chenya-Ides (born in 1871) and Blyuma (born in 1875). When Bialik was 8 years old, his father died. His mother took him to Zhytomyr to live with his Orthodox grandfather, Yankl-Moishe Bialik. Bialik would not see his mother for over twenty years, when he brought her to Odessa to live with him.

In Zhytomyr, Bialik explored European literature alongside the traditional Jewish religious education he received. At the age of 15, he convinced his grandfather to send him to the Volozhin Yeshiva in Vilna Governorate to study under Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin, where he hoped he could continue his Jewish schooling while expanding his knowledge of European literature. There, Bialik encountered the Haskala or Jewish Enlightenment movement and, as a result, drifted away from yeshiva life. A story in the biography of Chaim Soloveitchik cites an anonymous student, presumably Bialik himself, being expelled from the Yeshiva for involvement in the Haskala movement. As Rabbi Chaim was escorting him out, Bialik asked, &quot;Why?&quot; In response, the rabbi said he had spent the time convincing Bialik not to use his writing talents against the yeshiva world. Poems such as &quot;HaMatmid&quot; (&quot;The Talmud student&quot;), written in 1898, reflect Bialik&#x27;s great ambivalence toward that way of life: on the one hand, admiration for the dedication and devotion of the yeshiva students to their studies; on the other, a disdain for their narrow world.

At 18, Bialik left for Odessa. A center of modern Jewish culture in the southern Russian Empire, drawn by his admiration for authors such as Mendele Mocher Sforim and Ahad Ha&#x27;am. There, Bialik studied Russian and German language and literature while dreaming of enrolling in the Orthodox Rabbinical Seminary in Berlin. Alone and penniless, Bialik made his living teaching Hebrew.

The 1892 Bialik published his first poem, &quot;El Hatzipor&quot; &quot;To the Bird&quot;, which expresses a longing for Zion, in a booklet edited by Yehoshua Hana Rawnitzki (1859–1944), which opened the doors into the Jewish literary circles in Odessa. There, he joined the Hovevei Zion movement where he befriended the author Ahad Ha&#x27;am, who had a significant influence on his Zionist outlook.

In 1892, Bialik heard news that the Volozhin Yeshiva had closed and returned home to Zhytomyr to prevent his grandfather from discovering that he had discontinued his religious education. He arrived to find both his grandfather and his older brother close to death. Following their deaths, Bialik married Manya Averbuch in 1893.

For a time, he served as a bookkeeper in his father-in-law&#x27;s lumber business in Korostyshiv, near Kyiv. This proved unsuccessful so, in 1897, he moved to Sosnowiec, a small town in the Dąbrowa Basin in Vistula Land in Congress Poland, which was controlled by the Russian Empire. There, Bialik worked both as a Hebrew teacher and, to earn extra income, a coal merchant. In 1900, feeling depressed by the provincial life of Sosnowiec, Bialik secured a teaching job in Odessa.

Bialik visited the United States, where he stayed with his cousin Raymond Bialeck in Hartford, CT. He is the uncle of actress Mayim Bialik&#x27;s great-great-grandfather.

==Literary career==

The year 1900 marked the beginning of Bialik&#x27;s &quot;golden period&quot;: he continued his activities in Zionist and literary circles, and his literary fame continued to rise. In 1901 his first collection of poetry was published in Warsaw, where it was greeted with much critical acclaim, being hailed as &quot;the poet of national Renaissance&quot;. Bialik relocated to Warsaw briefly in 1904 to serve as literary editor of the weekly magazine &quot;HaShiloah&quot; founded by Ahad Ha&#x27;am, a position he served for six years.

In 1903, in the wake of the Kishinev pogroms, the Jewish Historical Commission in Odessa asked Bialik to travel to Kishiniev (today Chișinău) to interview survivors and prepare a report. In response to his findings, Bialik wrote his epic poem &quot;In the City of Slaughter&quot; (originally published under the name &quot;Massa Nemirov&quot;), a powerful statement of anguish at the situation of the Jews. The poem&#x27;s condemnation of passivity against anti-Semitic violence is said to have inspired thousands of Jewish youths to cast off their pacifism and join the Russian underground against the Czar, the founding of Jewish self-defense groups in the Russian Empire, and, later on, the Haganah in Palestine.

It was during his visit to Odessa that Bialik first met the painter Ira Jan, with whom he conducted a secret love affair for many years.

In the early 1900s, Bialik, together with Yehoshua Rawnitzki, Simcha Ben Zion and Elhanan Leib Lewinsky, founded &quot;Moriah&quot;, a publishing house aimed at issuing Hebrew classics and school texts. He translated into Hebrew various European works, such as William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s &quot;William Tell&quot;, Miguel de Cervantes&#x27; novel &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, Heinrich Heine&#x27;s poems, and S. Ansky&#x27;s &quot;The Dybbuk&quot;.

Throughout the years 1899–1915, Bialik published about 20 of his Yiddish poems in differen periodicals throughout the Russian Empire. These poems are often considered to be among the best of modern Yiddish poetry. Starting in 1908, Bialik switched to writing in prose: In collaboration with Rawnitzki, Bialik published &quot;Sefer HaAggadah&quot; (&quot;The Book of Legends,&quot; 1908–1911), a three-volume edition of the folk tales and proverbs scattered throughout the Talmud. The book comprises a selection of hundreds of texts arranged thematically. It was immediately recognized as a masterwork and has been reprinted numerous times. Bialik also edited the poems of the Andalusi poet and philosopher Solomon ibn Gabirol and began a modern commentary on the Mishna, but only completed Zeraim, the first of the six Sedarim (Orders), of the Mishna. For this, Bialik intentionally chose to use the traditional Vilna edition of the Mishnah instead of a more scientific text and created, arguably, the first modern commentary to a Seder of Mishnah that included, in its introduction, a summary of the content as well as all of the relevant biblical passages. In the 1950s, under the direction of Hanoch Albeck, the Bialik Institute published a commentary on the entire Mishnah, an expansion of Bialik&#x27;s project.

In 1919 in Odessa, Bialik founded the Dvir publishing house. The institution, now based in Israel, is known today as Kinneret Zmora-Bitan Dvir after it was purchased by the Zmora-Bitan publishing house in 1986, and subsequently merged with Kinneret Publishing. It was in Odessa, where BIalik befriended the soprano Isa Kremer, and inspired her to become the first woman sing Yiddish music on the concert stage.

Bialik remained in Odessa until 1921, when the Moriah publishing house was closed by Soviet authorities as a result of mounting paranoia following the Bolshevik Revolution. Through the intervention of Maxim Gorky, a group of Hebrew writers were given permission by the Soviet government to leave the country;

==Move to Germany==

Bialik moved, via the Second Polish Republic and Revolutionary Ankara Turkey, to Berlin, where, together with his friends Yehoshua Rawnitzki and Shmaryahu Levin, he re-established the Dvir publishing house. There, in collaboration with the rabbinical college Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums, Bialik published the first Hebrew language scientific journal.

In Germany, Bialik joined a community of noted Jewish authors and publishers. Among them were Shmuel Yosef Agnon, Salman Schocken (owner of Schocken Department Stores and founder of Schocken Books), the historian Simon Dubnow, Israel Isidor Elyashev, Uri Zvi Greenberg, Jakob Klatzkin (cofounder of the &quot;Eshkol&quot; publishing house in Berlin), Moyshe Kulbak, Zeev Latsky (&quot;Bertoldi&quot;) (cofounder of &quot;Klal-farlag&quot; publishing house in Berlin in 1922), Simon Rawidowicz (co-founder of &quot;Klal-farlag&quot;), Zalman Shneour, Nochum Shtif, Shaul Tchernichovsky, Shoshana Persitz (founder of Omanut publishing house) and Martin Buber. They met routinely at the Hebrew Committee House ) in Berlin&#x27;s Scheunenviertel, in Café Monopol, which had a Hebrew-speaking corner, or Café des Westens (both in Berlin&#x27;s more elegant western boroughs).

Bialik succeeded Klal Publishing&#x27;s Hebrew chief editor, Saul Israel Hurwitz, upon his death on August 8, 1922, during which time 80 titles were published.

In January 1923, Bialik&#x27;s 50th birthday was celebrated in the old concert hall of the Berlin Philharmonic, bringing together everybody who was anybody.

==Move to Tel Aviv==
Bialik first visited Palestine in 1909. In 1924, he relocated with his publishing house Dvir to the township of Tel Aviv, devoting himself to cultural activities and public affairs and becoming a celebrated literary figure in the Yishuv. In 1927, Bialik was elected as head of the Hebrew Writers Association, a position he retained for the rest of his life. That year, he founded the &quot;Oneg Shabbat&quot; society of Tel Aviv, which sponsored communal gatherings on Shabbat afternoons to study Torah and sing. Even though he was not an observant Jew, Bialik believed that public observance of Shabbat was essential to preserving the Jewish people. In response to criticism regarding his community activism, Bialik responded: &quot;Show me the judge who can say which is preferable: a good poem or a good deed.&quot;

==Works and influence==
Bialik wrote several different kinds of poetry: he is perhaps most famous for his long, nationalistic poems, which call for a reawakening of the Jewish people. Bialik had his own awakening even before writing those poems, arising out of the anger and shame he felt at the Jewish response to pogroms. In his poem In the City of Slaughter, Bialik excoriated the Jews of Kishinev who had allowed their persecutors to wreak their will without raising us to defend themselves. No less admired are his passionate poems on love, nature, the yearning for Zion and children&#x27;s poems.

Bialik wrote most of his poems using Ashkenazi pronunciation. Today, modern Israeli Hebrew uses the Sephardi pronunciation (what Miryam Segal called the &quot;new accent&quot;), i.e., an amalgam of vowels and consonantal sounds from variety of sources. Consequently, Bialik&#x27;s poems are rarely recited in the meter in which they were written, although according to Segal, the Ashkenazi (penultimate) stress pattern is still preserved.

Bialik contributed significantly to the revival of the Hebrew language, which, before his days was used almost exclusively for liturgy. The generation of Hebrew language poets who followed in Bialik&#x27;s footsteps, including Jacob Steinberg and Jacob Fichman, are known as &quot;the Bialik generation&quot;.

Bialik is honored as Israel&#x27;s national poet. Bialik House, his former home at 22 Bialik Street in Tel Aviv, has been converted into a museum and a center for literary events. The Bialik Prize for literature was established by the municipality of Tel Aviv; Kiryat Bialik, a suburb of Haifa, and Givat Hen, a moshav bordering the city of Raanana, are named after him. The research body and publishing house, the Bialik Institute, is named after him. He is the only person to have two streets named after him in the same Israeli city – Bialik Street and Hen Boulevard in Tel Aviv. There is a Bialik Hebrew Day School in Toronto, ON, Canada; a Bialik High School in Montreal, QC, Canada, and a cross-communal Jewish Zionist school in Melbourne called Bialik College; in Caracas, Venezuela, the Jewish community school is named Herzl-Bialik and the Jewish school in Rosario, Argentina is named after him.

Bialik&#x27;s poems have been translated into at least 30 languages, with some set to music as popular songs. These poems, and the songs based on them, have become an essential part of the education and culture of modern Israel and throughout the Jewish world.

==Death==
Bialik died in Vienna, Austria, on July 4, 1934, from a sudden heart attack a week after undergoing a successful prostate operation. His burial in Tel Aviv had a large mourning procession followed from his home on the street named after him, to his final resting place.

<text>Jane Hyatt Yolen (born February 11, 1939) is an American writer of fantasy, science fiction, and children&#x27;s books. She is the author or editor of more than 400 books, of which the best known is &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Arithmetic&quot;, a Holocaust novella. Her other works include the Nebula Award−winning short story &quot;Sister Emily&#x27;s Lightship&quot;, the novelette &quot;Lost Girls&quot;, &quot;Owl Moon&quot;, &quot;The Emperor and the Kite&quot;, and the &quot;Commander Toad&quot; series. She has collaborated on works with all three of her children, most extensively with Adam Stemple.

Yolen delivered the inaugural Alice G. Smith Lecture at the University of South Florida in 1989. In 2012 she became the first woman to give the Andrew Lang lecture. Yolen published her 400th book in early 2021, &quot;Bear Outside&quot;.

==Early life==
Jane Hyatt Yolen was born on February 11, 1939, at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She is the first child of Isabell Berlin Yolen, a psychiatric social worker who became a full-time mother and homemaker upon Yolen&#x27;s birth, and Will Hyatt Yolen, a journalist who wrote columns at the time for New York newspapers, and whose family emigrated from Ukraine to the United States. Both of Yolen&#x27;s parents were Jewish, and raised her secular-Jewish. Isabell also did volunteer work, and wrote short stories in her spare time. However, she was not able to sell them. Because the Hyatts, the family of Yolen&#x27;s grandmother, Mina Hyatt Yolen, only had girls, a number of the children of Yolen&#x27;s generation were given their last name as a middle name in order to perpetuate it.

When Yolen was barely one year old, the family moved to California to accommodate Will&#x27;s new job working for Hollywood film studios, doing publicity on films such as &quot;American Tragedy&quot; and &quot;Knut Rockne&quot;. The family moved back to New York City prior to the birth of Yolen&#x27;s brother, Steve. When Will joined the Army as a Second Lieutenant to fight in England during World War II, Yolen, her mother and brother lived with her grandparents, Danny and Dan, in Newport News, Virginia. After the war, the family moved back to Manhattan, living on Central Park West and 97th Street until Yolen turned 13. She attended PS 93, where she enjoyed writing and singing, and became friends with future radio presenter Susan Stamberg. She also engaged writing by creating a newspaper for her apartment with her brother that she sold for five cents a copy. She was accepted to Music and Art High School. During the summer prior to that semester, she attended a Vermont summer camp, which was her first involvement with the Society of Friends (Quakers). Her family also moved to a ranch house in Westport, Connecticut, where she attended Bedford Junior high for ninth grade, and then Staples High School. She received a BA from Smith College in 1960 and a master&#x27;s degree in Education from the University of Massachusetts in 1978. After graduating she moved back to New York City.

==Career==
Although Yolen considered herself a poet and a journalist/nonfiction writer, to her surprise she became a children&#x27;s book writer. Her first published book was &quot;Pirates in Petticoats&quot;, which she sold on her 22nd birthday, February 11, 1961.

During the 1960s, Yolen held editorial positions at various magazines and publishers in New York City, including Gold Medal Books, Routledge Books, and Alfred A. Knopf Juvenile Books. From 1990 to 1996 she ran her own young adult fiction imprint, Jane Yolen Books, at Harcourt Brace.

She has co-written two books with her son, the writer and musician Adam Stemple, &quot;Pay the Piper&quot; and &quot;Troll Bridge&quot;, both part of the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Fairy Tale series. She also wrote lyrics for the song &quot;Robin&#x27;s Complaint,&quot; recorded on the 1994 album &quot;Antler Dance&quot; by Stemple&#x27;s band Boiled in Lead.

As of 2021, Yolen has written more than 400 books.

== Personal life ==
In 1962, Yolen married David W. Stemple. They had three children, including musician Adam Stemple, and six grandchildren. David Stemple died in March 2006. Yolen lives in Hatfield, Massachusetts. She also owns a house in Scotland, where she lives for a few months each year.

<doc id="681047" wikidata="Q431286" url="?curid=681047" title="Pimp My Ride">
<text>Pimp My Ride is an American television series produced by MTV and hosted by rapper Xzibit, which ran for six seasons on MTV from 2004 to 2007. In each episode, a car in poor condition is both restored and customized. The work on the show was done by West Coast Customs until season 5 and was done by Galpin Auto Sports thereafter.

The show had several international adaptations, including &quot;Pimp My Ride UK&quot;, &quot;Pimp My Ride International&quot; (in central Europe), and other adaptations in Brazil, Indonesia and the Baltic countries. It also spawned similar spinoffs, including the series &quot;Trick My Truck&quot; on MTV&#x27;s sister network CMT.

The show was criticized by several participants for exaggerating or faking several aspects of the restorations and many aspects of the show.

In 2024, &quot;Pimp My Ride&quot; co-creator Rick Hurvitz brought a re-tooled version of the show to Netflix. Now titled &quot;Resurrected Rides&quot;, Hurvitz is an executive producer. Chris Redd serves as host, with a team of mechanics and customizers from several different California-area auto shops working on the cars.

==Format==
An episode generally begins with the participant, a young vehicle owner from Los Angeles or elsewhere in Southern California, showing off their vehicle to convince MTV it needs to be &quot;pimped&quot;. After this segment, the host, Xzibit (Chamillionaire in one episode), takes a look at the participant&#x27;s car himself and makes wisecracks about the particular things that are wrong with it. He then surprises the participant at their house and the participant shows off their vehicle while Xzibit continues to make wisecracks about the particular things that are wrong with it. After examining the car, Xzibit promises the participant a complete makeover of the vehicle and takes it to a custom body shop (West Coast Customs (WCC), in Corona, California, in Seasons 1–4; replaced by Galpin Auto Sports (GAS) in Van Nuys starting Season 5).

At the body shop, the shop team generally replaces most of the car&#x27;s components and rebuilds the interior and exterior from scratch. The cars are &quot;pimped&quot; based on the hobbies and/or occupations of the owners. For example, a &quot;Need for Speed: Underground&quot; fan had his car painted to look like one specially customized in the &quot;Need for Speed&quot; video game series, while a bowler had a ball spinner installed in his trunk, a badminton player had a badminton net installed in the back of his Dodge Caravan, and a surfer got a clothes dryer in the back of his Volkswagen Type 2. Work usually includes new paint, accessories, chrome, tires, rims, and internal electronics (DVD players, video games, large TFT screens, and other accessories). Most changes are only cosmetic, and mechanical work is generally only done to enable the car to run, but the show has occasionally replaced car engines.

At the end of the show, the car is revealed to its owner, as well as all the details of the renovation and the custom features; in addition, the participant is usually given a gift somehow related to the car or their hobby.

==Episodes==
==Cast==

===Seasons 1–4===
The West Coast Customs employees shown on the series included:
*Quinton &quot;Q&quot; Dodson - Good-natured manager (seasons 1–3)
*Ryan Friedlinghaus - Owner
*Alex - Heavily-pierced tire specialist
*Ishmael &quot;Ish&quot; Jimenez - Tough-looking interior and fabric maven
*Michael &quot;Mad Mike&quot; Martin - Electronics (and outrageous engineering) expert 
*&quot;Big Dane&quot; - Appropriately named accessories specialist
* Aren, Buck, 2Shae, and Luis - Paint. The latter carried on into the following seasons.

After the third season, WCC manager &quot;Q&quot; announced that he would not be willing to take a role in the show anymore. Q cited a desire to expand the company&#x27;s business with a customs shop in St. Louis, Missouri called Coast 2 Coast Customs. Ryan Friedlinghaus, the owner of WCC, was featured in Season 4 as the &quot;lead&quot; for discussions on customizing the cars.

===Seasons 5–6===
In the fifth season, the show moved to another garage, Galpin Auto Sports (GAS), as Ryan, the WCC Owner, moved his shop to Corona, California and signed a deal with another television production company. However, the show retained Mad Mike (who quit at WCC and signed at GAS), now dubbed a &quot;car customization specialist&quot;. The new cast consisted of:
* &quot;Owner&quot; Beau Boeckmann (in reality, Vice President of Galpin Auto; the owner of Galpin Auto was his father, Bert Boeckmann)
*Michael &quot;Mad Mike&quot; Martin - Electronics expert and &quot;The Wizard of Wiring&quot;
*&quot;Jason&quot; Ewing - Wiring and fiberglass fabrication
*Gyasi - Wheels and tires specialist
*Luis - Paint &amp; body
*Diggity Dave - Accessories specialist
*Rick - Interiors
*Cabe Sipes - Fabricator
*Z - Shop crew

==Replacement vehicles==
On three occasions – all season finales – the show did not &quot;pimp&quot; the original automobile.

*In the final episode of season 1, the car to be pimped was actually two-halves of Ford Escorts welded together to make one car, a &quot;cut and shut&quot; job, and was declared unsafe.
*In the final episode of season 2, the participant was studying to be an auto mechanic, and WCC decided to let him &quot;pimp&quot; his car as a study project.
*In the final episode of season 5, Xzibit felt that the owner&#x27;s car, a Nissan Pulsar, was not worth fixing, as heat from the car&#x27;s engine and battery fluid was leaking into the cab, creating a fire hazard.

In all these instances, the vehicles of the participants were replaced with brand new cars, with extensive modifications made to customize each new car for the owner.

==Worldwide popularity==
&quot;Pimp My Ride&quot; was one of MTV&#x27;s most popular shows with nearly all of its worldwide viewers, and also in the U.S., where it ranked second only to &quot;The Real World&quot;.

Canada&#x27;s music network, MuchMusic, aired the show until MTV Networks signed a deal with CTV, which resulted in MuchMusic losing their rights to MTV programs. MuchMusic&#x27;s French-language sister station, MusiquePlus, aired the show subtitled in French under the title &quot;Pimp mon char&quot; (&quot;char&quot; is Quebec French slang for &quot;car&quot;). The show would eventually re-air on Much in the Summer of 2008, showing the later seasons.

&quot;Pimp My Ride&quot; was broadcast in Arab countries on both MTV Arabia and MBC Action.

In 2012, MTV Southeast Asia aired the first episode of &quot;Pimp My Ride Malaysia&quot;, which is sponsored by Celcom Axiata under its &quot;Xpax&quot;’s Whatchuwant? campaign, giving Xpax customers a chance to have their vehicles worked on by MTV, hosted by Altimet and Herrera.

==Claims of deception by participants==
Several participants who appeared on seasons 4 and 6 of &quot;Pimp My Ride&quot; later stated that elements of the show were either exaggerated or faked. The houses where Xzibit would surprise contestants with the news they were selected were often rented by MTV. The initial poor condition of some of the vehicles was staged to look worse, including the removal of paint, trash in the interior, and bumpers loosened to the point of falling off. Some features added during filming were removed immediately afterwards due to potential issues with local and state traffic laws, and the participants noted that multiple takes were needed to film their reactions during the final reveal. Some were coached to express more amazement and enthusiasm between takes. The overhaul process, which appeared on the show to only last a few days or weeks, actually lasted 6–7 months, and the show&#x27;s participants had to find their own transportation while their cars were being upgraded with no support from the network. In addition, the modifications made to the cars were often purely cosmetic and any problems with how the car ran—wheel alignment, engine, transmission—was still up to the participants to fix. In an interview with HipHopDX, Xzibit explains about how he was the target of backlash on social media over his involvement in the show, even though he was merely the host and had no input in the actual vehicle modification.

Official adaptations of &quot;Pimp My Ride&quot;, produced or co-produced by international MTV affiliates, include:

* &quot;Pimp My Ride International&quot; (across Europe), a European version of the show where cars are pimped from all over Europe in the Netherlands at All Stoff. The show is hosted by American rappers Lil&#x27; Jon and Fat Joe.
* &quot;Pimp My Ride UK&quot; (United Kingdom, 2005-2007), presented by the DJ Tim Westwood. Carisma Automotive are the customizers for the UK version.
* &quot;Pimp My Ride Baltic&quot; (2008).
* &quot;&quot; (Brazil, 2007-2008), presented by singer Jimmy London from the rock band Matanza.
* &quot;Pimp My Car&quot; (Indonesia), which aired on MTV Indonesia.
* &quot;Pimp My Ride France&quot; (France, 2009-2011), which aired on MTV France. The show was presented by Ramzy and had two seasons.

===Others===
* &quot;Pimp My Fahrrad&quot; (Germany), which aired on the German-language MTV Central. In the show, the Hamburg-based bike shop Junior&#x27;s Club (referred to as &quot;Elbcoast Psycles&quot; on the show) redoes almost an entire bicycle (&quot;fahrrad&quot; being the German word for bicycle), usually leaving only the frame intact. While the show could be seen as a parody of the American original, it is also a loving tribute, using all the elements of the American show with a bicycle twist (Germany&#x27;s safety guidelines are among the strictest in the world, and getting a road permit for thoroughly customized vehicles borders on the impossible. Similar rules apply in most of continental Europe). It is hosted by German actor Oliver Korittke.
* &quot;Pimp My Whatever&quot; (Germany). A spin-off of &quot;Pimp My Fahrrad&quot; in which ElbCoast Psychos return to &quot;pimp&quot; anything from a bathroom and a doghouse to a birthday party or even someone&#x27;s brother. &quot;Pimp My Whatever&quot; is hosted by MTV presenter Patrice Bouédibéla. Both shows are located in Hamburg.
* &quot;Pimp My Wheels&quot; (Italy). Airing on MTV Italy, this show turns old rusty motorscooters or motorcycles into brand-new shiny vehicles. Hosted by the Italian hip hop group Gemelli Diversi.
* &quot;Pimp My Room&quot; (The Netherlands) features some friendly competition between three students to see who will win the university student bedroom or apartment overhaul. Subsequently, the room is &quot;pimped&quot;.
* &quot;Pimpa Meu Feed&quot; (Brazil). Airing on MTV Brazil social media, the show helps participants to boost their instagram, leverage the number of followers and get involved in this (much desired) life of influencer. It is hosted by Leo Picon and Ste Viegas.

==Legal action against business that used &quot;Pimp My...&quot;==
Viacom, owner of the &quot;Pimp My Ride&quot; franchise, threatened legal action against a number of small businesses in 2006 over the use of the phrase &quot;Pimp My...&quot; in business names. Pimp My Snack, a recipe-sharing website, received one such warning letter and later renamed the business to Pimp That Snack. A British lawyer specializing in copyright concerns criticized the move, stating that trademark infringement cannot apply to companies that are providing different goods and services.

<doc id="681048" wikidata="Q2568029" url="?curid=681048" title="The Continental Op">
<text>The Continental Op is a fictional character created by Dashiell Hammett. He is a private investigator employed as an operative of the Continental Detective Agency&#x27;s San Francisco office. The stories are all told in the first person and his name is never given.

== Profile ==

The Continental Op is a master of deceit in the exercise of his occupation. In his 1927 &quot;Black Mask&quot; story &quot;$106,000 Blood Money&quot; the Op is confronted with a dilemma: should he expose a corrupt fellow detective, thereby hurting the reputation of his agency; and should he also allow an informant to collect the $106,000 reward in a big case even though he is morally certain—but cannot prove—that the informant has murdered one of his agency&#x27;s clients? The Op resolves his two problems neatly by manipulating events so that the corrupt detective and the informant get into an armed confrontation in which both are killed.

Decades of witnessing human cruelty, misery, and ruin, as well as being instrumental in sending hundreds of people to jail, or to the gallows, have greatly weakened the Op&#x27;s natural sympathy with his fellow men. He fears becoming like his boss, &quot;The Old Man&quot;, whom he describes as &quot;a shell, without any human feelings whatsoever&quot;.

In the penultimate chapter of &quot;The Dain Curse&quot;, a female client, whose life the Op has saved three times, while also curing her of morphine addiction, says to him:

The Op is one of the first major hardboiled detectives later developed in such characters as Hammett&#x27;s own Sam Spade, Raymond Chandler&#x27;s Philip Marlowe, Mickey Spillane&#x27;s Mike Hammer, Ross Macdonald&#x27;s Lew Archer and others.

== Publication history ==
As many of Hammett&#x27;s short stories were later published in collected volumes, the publishing history of these works is sometimes confused. The Continental Op made his debut in the October 1923 issue of &quot;Black Mask&quot;, making him one of the earliest hard-boiled private detective characters to appear in the pulp magazines of the early twentieth century. He appeared in 36 short stories, all but two of which appeared in &quot;Black Mask.&quot;

With the intent of transitioning from short stories to novels, Hammett began writing linked stories in 1924, &quot;The House in Turk Street&quot; and &quot;The Girl with the Silver Eyes&quot;. Two other related stories, &quot;The Big Knockover&quot; and &quot;$106,000 Blood Money&quot; appeared in &quot;Black Mask&quot; in 1927. The transition culminated in 1927, with the linked stories which formed the basis for his first two novels, &quot;Red Harvest&quot; and &quot;The Dain Curse,&quot; both novels released in 1929. The texts in the novels differ from the pulp magazine versions as they were revised by an editor at Alfred A. Knopf.

Starting in the Second World War, many of the short stories were reprinted as serials in American newspapers, sometimes under different titles. Ten collections of Hammett short works, including most of the Continental Op stories, were published by Mercury Publications under an imprint, either &quot;Bestsellers Mystery&quot;, &quot;A Jonathan Press Mystery&quot; or &quot;Mercury Mystery&quot;. The majority of these collections printed as paperbacks contained introductory essays by Ellery Queen. Frederic Dannay, half of the duo using the pseudonym Ellery Queen, compiled and edited the Hammett&#x27;s stories such that these versions are not complete. Of the ten, the following contain Continental Op stories:
&quot;$106,000 Blood Money&quot; (later republished as &quot;The Big Knock-Over&quot;), &quot;The Continental Op&quot;, &quot;The Return of the Continental Op&quot;, &quot;Hammett Homicides&quot;, &quot;Dead Yellow Women&quot;, &quot;Nightmare Town&quot;, &quot;Creeping Siamese&quot;, and &quot;Women in the Dark&quot;. When the paperback collections proved popular, World Publishing under their &quot;Tower Books&quot; imprint, published them in hardcover. Many of these edited versions were later republished as Dell mapbacks.

In the late 1960s, Hammett&#x27;s writing was rediscovered and republished with somewhat confusing titles. Of the 28 stories not a part of &quot;Red Harvest&quot; or &quot;The Dain Curse&quot;, 26 have been made available in one of three collections, &quot;The Big Knockover,&quot; &quot;The Continental Op,&quot; and &quot;Nightmare Town&quot;. These new anthologies do not include the same stories as the similarly titled Mercury Publications. Up until the 21st century these three volumes were the easiest way to access most of the stories. However, all of these collections used the abridged versions Dannay created for his compilations.

The Library of America&#x27;s &quot;Complete Novels&quot; includes both &quot;Red Harvest&quot; and &quot;The Dain Curse&quot; as printed by Knopf. The companion collection &quot;Crime Stories and Other Writings&quot; does not include the original pulp magazine texts. For the first two printings of this collection, as is said in the &quot;Notes on the Texts&quot;: &quot;No copy is known to be extant of the issue of the pulp magazine &quot;Mystery Stories&quot; in which &#x27;This King Business&#x27; initially appeared, in January 1928.&quot; When a copy was located a third printing was issued with the integral text.

In 2017, Vintage Crime published a complete collection of all 36 Continental Op stories also based on the pulp magazine texts and an, until then, unpublished story fragment entitled &quot;Three Dimes.&quot;

== List of stories ==

Using the texts that were first published in the pulp magazines, &quot;The Big Book of the Continental Op&quot; includes all 37 entries of the list; the 28 short stories, the unfinished story and the eight parts of the two serialized novels, &quot;The Cleansing of Poisonville&quot; (&quot;Red Harvest&quot;) and &quot;The Dain Curse&quot; as they first appeared in the pulp magazines. 
==Dramatic adaptations==
*In 1939, &quot;The Farewell Murder&quot; was adapted as &quot;Another Thin Man&quot;, the third entry in the Thin Man film series. The story was modified to star Hammett&#x27;s Nick and Nora Charles in place of the Continental Op.
*In 1978, &quot;&quot;The Dain Curse&quot; was made into a six-hour CBS television miniseries starring James Coburn. For the miniseries, the Op was named Hamilton Nash (his creator&#x27;s name &#x27;spelled sideways&#x27;).
*In 1982, Peter Boyle played the Continental Op in the opening of &quot;Hammett&quot;, while Hammett (Frederic Forrest) writes a story about the detective character. Boyle later appears as Jimmy Ryan, Hammett&#x27;s former co-worker and mentor from his Pinkerton days, who expresses a conviction that the Op is based on him and criticizes Hammett for not giving the character a name.
*In 1995, Christopher Lloyd played The Continental Op in &quot;Fly Paper&quot;, in season 2 episode 7 of the TV anthology series &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; adapted from Hammett&#x27;s short story, co-starring Darren McGavin as The Old Man.

<text>In geometric topology and differential topology, an (&quot;n&quot; + 1)-dimensional cobordism &quot;W&quot; between &quot;n&quot;-dimensional manifolds &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; is an &quot;h&quot;-cobordism (the &quot;h&quot; stands for homotopy equivalence) if the inclusion maps

: formula_1

are homotopy equivalences.

The &quot;h&quot;-cobordism theorem gives sufficient conditions for an &quot;h&quot;-cobordism to be trivial, i.e., to be C-isomorphic to the cylinder &quot;M&quot; × [0, 1]. Here C refers to any of the categories of [[smooth manifold|smooth]], [[piecewise linear manifold|piecewise linear]], or [[topological manifold|topological]] manifolds.

The theorem was first proved by Stephen Smale for which he received the Fields Medal and is a fundamental result in the theory of high-dimensional manifolds. For a start, it almost immediately proves the generalized Poincaré conjecture.

==Background==
Before Smale proved this theorem, mathematicians became stuck while trying to understand manifolds of dimension 3 or 4, and assumed that the higher-dimensional cases were even harder. The &quot;h&quot;-cobordism theorem showed that (simply connected) manifolds of dimension at least 5 are much easier than those of dimension 3 or 4. The proof of the theorem depends on the &quot;Whitney trick&quot; of Hassler Whitney, which geometrically untangles homologically-untangled spheres of complementary dimension in a manifold of dimension &gt;4. An informal reason why manifolds of dimension 3 or 4 are unusually hard is that the trick fails to work in lower dimensions, which have no room for entanglement.

==Precise statement of the &quot;h&quot;-cobordism theorem==

Let &quot;n&quot; be at least 5 and let &quot;W&quot; be a compact (&quot;n&quot; + 1)-dimensional &quot;h&quot;-cobordism between &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; in the category C=Diff, PL, or Top such that &quot;W&quot;, &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; are simply connected. Then &quot;W&quot; is C-isomorphic to &quot;M&quot; × [0, 1]. The isomorphism can be chosen to be the identity on &quot;M&quot; × {0}.

This means that the homotopy equivalence between &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; (or, between &quot;M&quot; × [0, 1], &quot;W&quot; and &quot;N&quot; × [0, 1]) is homotopic to a C-isomorphism.

==Lower dimensional versions==
For &quot;n&quot; = 4, the &quot;h&quot;-cobordism theorem is false. This can be seen since Wall proved that closed oriented simply-connected topological four-manifolds with equivalent intersection forms are &quot;h&quot;-cobordant. However, if the intersection form is odd there are non-homeomorphic 4-manifolds with the same intersection form (distinguished by the Kirby-Siebenmann class). For example, CP2 and a fake projective plane with the same homotopy type are not homeomorphic but both have intersection form of (1).

For &quot;n&quot; = 3, the &quot;h&quot;-cobordism theorem for smooth manifolds has not been proved and, due to the 3-dimensional Poincaré conjecture, is equivalent to the hard open question of whether the 4-sphere has non-standard smooth structures.

For &quot;n&quot; = 2, the &quot;h&quot;-cobordism theorem is equivalent to the Poincaré conjecture stated by Poincaré in 1904 (one of the Millennium Problems) and was proved by Grigori Perelman in a series of three papers in 2002 and 2003, where he follows Richard S. Hamilton&#x27;s program using Ricci flow.

For &quot;n&quot; = 1, the &quot;h&quot;-cobordism theorem is vacuously true, since there is no closed simply-connected 1-dimensional manifold.

For &quot;n&quot; = 0, the &quot;h&quot;-cobordism theorem is trivially true: the interval is the only connected cobordism between connected 0-manifolds.

==A proof sketch==
A Morse function formula_2 induces a handle decomposition of &quot;W&quot;, i.e., if there is a single critical point of index &quot;k&quot; in formula_3, then the ascending cobordism formula_4 is obtained from formula_5 by attaching a &quot;k&quot;-handle. The goal of the proof is to find a handle decomposition with no handles at all so that integrating the non-zero gradient vector field of &quot;f&quot; gives the desired diffeomorphism to the trivial cobordism.

This is achieved through a series of techniques.

1) Handle rearrangement

First, we want to rearrange all handles by order so that lower order handles are attached first. The question is thus when can we slide an &quot;i&quot;-handle off of a &quot;j&quot;-handle? This can be done by a radial isotopy so long as the &quot;i&quot; attaching sphere and the &quot;j&quot; belt sphere do not intersect. We thus want formula_6 which is equivalent to formula_7.

We then define the handle chain complex formula_8 by letting formula_9 be the free abelian group on the &quot;k&quot;-handles and defining formula_10 by sending a &quot;k&quot;-handle formula_11 to formula_12, where formula_13 is the intersection number of the &quot;k&quot;-attaching sphere and the (&quot;k&quot; − 1)-belt sphere.

2) Handle cancellation

Next, we want to &quot;cancel&quot; handles. The idea is that attaching a &quot;k&quot;-handle formula_14 might create a hole that can be filled in by attaching a (&quot;k&quot; + 1)-handle formula_15. This would imply that formula_16 and so the formula_17 entry in the matrix of formula_18 would be formula_19. However, when is this condition sufficient? That is, when can we geometrically cancel handles if this condition is true? The answer lies in carefully analyzing when the manifold remains simply-connected after removing the attaching and belt spheres in question, and finding an embedded disk using the Whitney trick. This analysis leads to the requirement that &quot;n&quot; must be at least 5. Moreover, during the proof one requires that the cobordism has no 0-,1-,&quot;n&quot;-, or (&quot;n&quot; + 1)-handles which is obtained by the next technique.

3) Handle trading

The idea of handle trading is to create a cancelling pair of (&quot;k&quot; + 1)- and (&quot;k&quot; + 2)-handles so that a given &quot;k&quot;-handle cancels with the (&quot;k&quot; + 1)-handle leaving behind the (&quot;k&quot; + 2)-handle. To do this, consider the core of the &quot;k&quot;-handle which is an element in formula_20. This group is trivial since &quot;W&quot; is an &quot;h&quot;-cobordism. Thus, there is a disk formula_21 which we can fatten to a cancelling pair as desired, so long as we can embed this disk into the boundary of &quot;W&quot;. This embedding exists if formula_22. Since we are assuming &quot;n&quot; is at least 5 this means that &quot;k&quot; is either 0 or 1. Finally, by considering the negative of the given Morse function, −&quot;f&quot;, we can turn the handle decomposition upside down and also remove the &quot;n&quot;- and (&quot;n&quot; + 1)-handles as desired.

4) Handle sliding

Finally, we want to make sure that doing row and column operations on formula_23 corresponds to a geometric operation. Indeed, it isn&#x27;t hard to show (best done by drawing a picture) that sliding a &quot;k&quot;-handle formula_14 over another &quot;k&quot;-handle formula_25 replaces formula_14 by formula_27 in the basis for formula_9.

The proof of the theorem now follows: the handle chain complex is exact since formula_29. Thus formula_30 since the formula_9 are free. Then formula_23, which is an integer matrix, restricts to an invertible morphism which can thus be diagonalized via elementary row operations (handle sliding) and must have only formula_19 on the diagonal because it is invertible. Thus, all handles are paired with a single other cancelling handle yielding a decomposition with no handles.

==The &quot;s&quot;-cobordism theorem ==
If the assumption that &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; are simply connected is dropped, &quot;h&quot;-cobordisms need not be cylinders; the obstruction is exactly the Whitehead torsion τ (&quot;W&quot;, &quot;M&quot;) of the inclusion formula_34.

Precisely, the &quot;s&quot;-cobordism theorem (the &quot;s&quot; stands for simple-homotopy equivalence), proved independently by Barry Mazur, John Stallings, and Dennis Barden, states (assumptions as above but where &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; need not be simply connected):
: An &quot;h&quot;-cobordism is a cylinder if and only if Whitehead torsion τ (&quot;W&quot;, &quot;M&quot;) vanishes.
The torsion vanishes if and only if the inclusion formula_34 is not just a homotopy equivalence, but a simple homotopy equivalence.

Note that one need not assume that the other inclusion formula_36 is also a simple homotopy equivalence—that follows from the theorem.

Categorically, &quot;h&quot;-cobordisms form a groupoid.

Then a finer statement of the &quot;s&quot;-cobordism theorem is that the isomorphism classes of this groupoid (up to C-isomorphism of &quot;h&quot;-cobordisms) are torsors for the respective Whitehead groups Wh(π), where formula_37

<text>The Andante favori is a work for piano solo by Ludwig van Beethoven. In catalogues of Beethoven&#x27;s works, it is designated as WoO 57.

==Composition and reception==
The &quot;Andante favori&quot; was written between 1803 and 1804, and published in 1805. It was originally intended to be the second of the three movements of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Waldstein&quot; Piano Sonata, Op. 53. The following extract from Thayer&#x27;s Beethoven biography explains the change:

:&quot;Ries reports (&quot;Notizen&quot;, p. 101) that a friend of Beethoven&#x27;s said to him that the sonata was too long, for which he was terribly taken to task by the composer. But after quiet reflection Beethoven was convinced of the correctness of the criticism. The andante... was therefore excluded and in its place supplied the interesting Introduction to the rondo which it now has. A year after the publication of the sonata, the andante also appeared separately.&quot; 

It was composed as a musical declaration of love for Countess Josephine Brunsvik, but the Brunsvik family increased the pressure to terminate the relationship. She could not contemplate marrying Beethoven, a commoner.

The reason for the title was given by Beethoven&#x27;s pupil Czerny, quoted in Thayer: &quot;Because of its popularity (for Beethoven played it frequently in society) he gave it the title &quot;Andante favori&quot; (&quot;favored Andante&quot;).

==The music==
The &quot;Andante favori&quot; is in F major (the subdominant of the &quot;Waldstein&quot; key), in 3/8 time, and is marked &quot;Andante grazioso con moto&quot;. Formally, the work is a rondo, with each return of the theme appearing in varied form. The theme itself is fairly extended and in ternary form. The work takes about nine minutes to play.

==Adaptations in popular culture==
The makers of the 1995 BBC adaptation of Jane Austen&#x27;s novel &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; used the &quot;Andante favori&quot; as the musical content of a concocted scene in which Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy exchange tender glances while his sister Georgiana plays the andante on the fortepiano. The action of the scene is timed to match two modulations in the music, from F to D major and then back again.

<text>Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 21 in C major, Op. 53, known as the , is one of the three most notable sonatas of his middle period (the other two being the &quot;Appassionata&quot;, Op. 57, and &quot;Les Adieux&quot;, Op. 81a). Completed in summer 1804 and surpassing Beethoven&#x27;s previous piano sonatas in its scope, the &quot;&quot; is a key early work of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Heroic&quot; decade (1803–1812) and set a standard for piano composition in the grand manner.

The sonata&#x27;s name derives from Beethoven&#x27;s dedication to his close friend and patron Count Ferdinand Ernst Gabriel von Waldstein, member of Bohemian noble Waldstein family (Valdštejn). It is the only work that Beethoven dedicated to him. It is also known as &quot;L&#x27;Aurora&quot; (The Dawn) in Italian, for the sonority of the opening chords of the third movement, thought to conjure an image of daybreak.

It is considered one of Beethoven&#x27;s greatest and most technically challenging piano sonatas. The first section of the rondo requires a simultaneous pedal trill, high melody and rapid left hand runs, and the coda features octave glissandi written in dialogue between the hands.

An average performance of the entire &quot;Waldstein&quot; lasts about twenty-five minutes.

== Movements ==
The &quot;Waldstein&quot; has three movements:

The first and last movements of the sonata are the most substantial, each taking about 11 minutes to perform. The second movement only lasts about 4 minutes in performance.

=== I. Allegro con brio ===
The first movement is in sonata form and common time: it has a repeated exposition with two subject groups, a development section, a recapitulation and a coda.

The movement opens with repeated pianissimo chords in a straightforward but anxious rhythm, devoid of melody for two bars:

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {

» } }
&lt;/score&gt;

It then swiftly ascends, followed by a three-note descent in the middle register and a four-note descent in the upper. This phrase is then repeated starting on B major – a whole tone lower – a device Beethoven also used for the opening of the Sonata No. 16 in G Major (Op. 31 No. 1). After a half cadence to the dominant (G major), the opening phrase returns again but this time in a tremolo variation.
The second subject group, marked &quot;dolce&quot;, is a chordal theme in E major, the mediant key. Modulation to the mediant for the second subject area is another feature shared by this sonata and the Sonata No. 16. Beethoven would employ the same shift again in later works (in the &quot;Hammerklavier Sonata&quot;, for example).

For the recapitulation, Beethoven transposes the second subject into A major, quickly changing into A minor and then back to C major for the coda.

=== II. Introduzione. Adagio molto ===

&lt;/score&gt;

The Introduzione is a short Adagio in time that serves as an introduction to the third movement. This replaced an earlier, longer middle movement, later published as the &quot;Andante favori&quot;, WoO 57. The music gradually gets more agitated before calming down to transition into the rondo third movement. Beethoven would later repeat this procedure in his later piano sonatas, notably the Appassionata and Les Adieux. 

=== III. Rondo. Allegretto moderato – Prestissimo ===
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {

}
&lt;/score&gt;

The rondo begins with a pianissimo melody played with crossed hands that soon becomes fortissimo, over daringly fast scales in the left hand and a continuous trill on the dominant in the right, as described above. The second theme, a series of broken chords in triplets, is soon interrupted by a turbulent section in A minor that foreshadows the central episode.

The music returns to C major and the sweet theme is repeated, followed by a series of staccato octaves in C minor that mark the start of the central episode, one of the few cases where such a melodic change is seen, a tactic repeated in larger works like the &quot;Emperor Piano Concerto&quot;. Soon the octaves are accompanied by swirling triplets in the left and then the right hand. The music grows more tense and eventually reaches a cadence in C minor. The next section brings back the opening theme in chords and further develops it: it appears in A major (bars 221–224), then F minor (225–228) and then D major (229–232); it is fragmented into shorter phrases (233–238) and then transits into a quiet section with major 7th arpeggios, returning after much drama to the C major theme played fortissimo.

The second theme reappears, followed by another characteristic long line of dance-like music. Another series of fortissimo chords announces a short, delicate pianissimo section: the movement seems to die away but then unexpectedly segues into a virtuosic prestissimo coda that plays with the various themes of the movement, ending in a triumphant rush of grandeur.

<text>Gary Owen, MBE (5 March 1929 – July 1995) was a Welsh, and later Australian, snooker player. Winning the 1963 English Amateur Championship qualified him to compete for England at the inaugural World Amateur Snooker Championship in Calcutta that year. He won all four of his matches in the round-robin competition and took the title. He became world amateur champion for a second time in 1966, beating John Spencer, who was the runner-up, in the decisive match.

He became a professional player in 1967, and won the 1968 Willie Smith Trophy, the first tournament that he played in as a professional. He was runner-up to Spencer at the 1969 World Snooker Championship. In 1971 he moved to Australia, and he represented that country at the 1979 World Challenge Cup, which was his last appearance as a professional player in the UK. He died in Brisbane, Australia in July 1995, aged 65, after experiencing long-term emphysema

==Early life and amateur career==
Gary Owen was born in Tumble, Carmarthenshire on 5 March 1929. His father was a local champion at snooker, and encouraged his sons to learn the game. Owen played snooker for the junior team at the Welcome Billiards Hall in Llanelly. Three days after his 14th birthday, he won the inaugural British Under-16 snooker championship, defeating Percy Hinton 4–3 in front of an audience of over 1,000. His highest break was 116 before starting his military National Service. He served in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, including 16 months stationed in Singapore, and played only rarely.

While working as a labourer, he reached the final of the English Amateur Championship in 1950 and was one frame from victory against Alf Nolan at 5–3 before losing the last three frames to finish as runner-up. The next year, he lost 2–5 in the last-16 round to Jim Allen, and in 1952 lost 2–5 in the quarter-finals to Cliff Wilson. In the early 1950s he moved to Yarmouth, where his father managed a billiard hall. Owen became a firefighter, and gave up competitive play for a number of years, returning to the game only in the early 1960s. By late 1956, he had moved to Birmingham.

Still working as a firefighter, in 1963 he matched the achievement of his younger brother Marcus in winning the English Amateur Championship. In the final he won nine consecutive frames from 2–3 behind to defeat Ron Gross 11–3. Owen and Gross played a televised challenge match later than year, which Gross won 4–2. Richard Holt of &quot;Billiards and Snooker&quot; magazine felt that both players were impressive in the televised match, and commented that &quot;Owen was always a joy to watch, with a command of advanced technique and masterful confidence.&quot;

Winning the English Amateur Championship qualified Owen to compete for England at the inaugural World Amateur Snooker Championship in Calcutta that year. He won all four of his matches in the Round-robin competition and took the title. His attempt to defend his English Amateur Championship title ended in the Southern region quarter-finals, when he lost 0–4 to Jonathan Barron.

He became world amateur champion for a second time in 1966, beating John Spencer, who was the runner-up, in the decisive match. In the 1967 Birthday Honours, Owen was awarded the MBE for services to snooker.

==Professional career and later life==
In 1967, Spencer, Owen and Ray Reardon become the first players since 1951 to turn professional. Owen was convinced to make the transition by a £250 contract with cue manufacturers Riley Burwat, who were looking for new names to use on their branded cues. As part of the deal, the company handled Owen&#x27;s bookings. His first tournament as a professional player was the 1968 Willie Smith Trophy, which was a round-robin tournament with Spencer, Jackie Rea, and amateur player John Dunning as the other competitors. Owen won all three of his matches and took the title. He also made the highest break of the tournament, 80, against Dunning in the final frame of the match that confirmed him as the champion. He made a maximum break of 147 in a non-competitive game at the Central Fire Station in Birmingham; although the break was not officially recognised as it did not happen in a public match, he was reportedly only the third British player to achieve the break.

In 1968–69 the World Snooker Championship was held as a knock-out format tournament after being contested on a challenge basis since 1964. In his first match, he eliminated Rea 25–17. In the semi-final he defeated Fred Davis 37–24. In the final, he faced Spencer, who took a 6–2 lead, before Owen levelled the match at 6–6. The &quot;Birmingham Daily Post&quot; correspondent praised the players for bringing a &quot;refreshing new look to the game, with bold attacking play, wonderful potting, and a sprinkling of good-sized breaks&quot;. Spencer was 15–9 ahead after the second day of the final, and maintained a six frame lead by the end of day three, at 21–15. On day four, Owen won four of the afternoon session&#x27;s six frames to close to 19–23. In the evening session, Spencer claimed the first three frames, and finished the day six frames ahead again at 27–21. Owen only won three of the twelve frames on the fifth day, leaving Spencer one frame from victory at 36–24. Owen&#x27;s brother Marcus commented that, &quot;Gary&#x27;s cueing is all over the place. Every time he plays a forcing shot, his whole body is moving.&quot; Spencer took the first frame on the final day to claim victory by achieving a winning margin of 37–24. Owen compiled a 100 break, the highest of the match, in the 66th frame during the dead frames after the title had been decided.

He was one of the eight competitors in the first series of &quot;Pot Black&quot; on BBC Television in 1969 and lost to John Pulman in the first round. In 1970 Owen defeated Reardon 6–4 in the final of the Stratford Professional. He was a world championship semi-finalist in 1970, beating Rex Williams 31–11 before being eliminated by Pulman 13–36. In the group stage of the 1971 edition he defeated Paddy Morgan and Norman Squire, but lost to Eddie Charlton and Warren Simpson, and did not progress past that stage. He withdrew from the 1972 championship and was replaced in the draw by Charlton.

Owen emigrated to Australia in April 1971, taking a job as the resident professional at the Western Suburbs Leagues Club, a snooker hall in Sydney. He later moved to Canberra, then the Gold Coast, and finally to Brisbane. He was runner-up to Charlton in the 1972 and 1973 Australian Professional Championships. He won against Simpson in his first match at the 1973 tournament but then lost 6–16 to Reardon in the quarter-final. Shortly after the 1973 campionship, he compiled his second maximum break, at the Western Suburbs Leagues Club. He played his bother Marcus in his first match in the 1974 World Snooker Championship, and lost 8–15. In 1975 he progressed through two rounds but was beaten 9–19 by Dennis Taylor in the quarter-finals. Taylor defeated him again in 1976, this time 15–9. Snooker historian Clive Everton later wrote that Owen &quot;seemed to have lost all heart for the game&quot; and was a lesser player than in the days when he had been world amateur champion. It was Owen&#x27;s last appearance at the world championship; although he entered in 1980, he did not play. Having gained Australian citizenship, he represented his new country at the World Challenge Cup in 1979, which was his last appearance as a professional player in the UK.

The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, the governing body for professional snooker, first published official world rankings for players on the main tour for the 1976–77 season. Owen was ranked tenth on the 1976–77 ranking list, which was the highest position that he attained in the rankings.

His playing technique included an unusually short . He preferred the use of s rather than in his break-building. In 1963, he said that he usually practised by playing English billiards, as having only three balls on the table helped him practice his ball control. In the early 1970s, Spencer described Owen as &quot;the best middle pocket potter I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; Owen died in Brisbane in July 1995, aged 65, after experiencing long-term emphysema.
