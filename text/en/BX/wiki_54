<text>Peter Senerchia (born October 11, 1967), better known by the ring name Taz (also spelled Tazz), is an American radio personality, color commentator, and retired professional wrestler signed to All Elite Wrestling (AEW) as a color commentator for &quot;AEW Dynamite&quot; and manager.

Beginning his career in 1987, Taz began his rise to prominence after joining Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW, later Extreme Championship Wrestling) in 1993 as The Tazmaniac. In late-1995, following a severe neck injury, he shortened his ring name to &quot;Taz&quot; and adopted the persona of a belligerent shoot fighter who dismantled opponents with an array of suplexes before forcing them to submit with the &quot;Tazmission&quot;. During his time in ECW, Taz was a two-time ECW World Heavyweight Champion, a two-time ECW World Television Champion, a three-time ECW World Tag Team Champion, a two-time (and the inaugural) FTW Heavyweight Champion, and the fourth ECW Triple Crown Champion.

In 1999, Taz left ECW to join the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, later WWE) where he was renamed &quot;Tazz&quot;. After largely retiring from the ring in 2002, he transitioned into a color commentary role. Upon leaving WWE in 2009, Taz joined Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) as a color commentator. He left TNA in 2015. In 2019, Taz joined the upstart AEW promotion, where he once again provided color commentary as well as managing Team Taz, a stable that included his son Tyler &quot;Hook&quot; Senerchia.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1987–1993) ===
Senerchia began wrestling in World Wrestling Council (WWC) and made his professional wrestling debut on June 3, 1987 in San Juan, Puerto Rico, after being trained by Johnny Rodz. He wrestled as Kid Krush before moving on to the name The Tazmaniac, of which he would use variations for the rest of his career. In the early 1990s as The Tazmaniac, he wrestled for International World Class Championship Wrestling (IWCCW) and held its Light Heavyweight Championship for six months in 1991. He would follow Tony Rumble in leaving IWCCW to join the newly established Century Wrestling Alliance (CWA). He would also tour in New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW)

Senerchia had his first World Wrestling Federation (WWF) match on August 19, 1991 as The Tazmaniac, when he was defeated by Ray Odyssey. He then made his only appearance ever in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) when he defeated Joey Maggs in a dark match at a &quot;Saturday Night&quot; taping in Atlanta, Georgia on February 8, 1993. He would then make his second appearance in the WWF on May 5, 1993. Wrestling in a dark match at a Wrestling Challenge taping in Portland, ME, Tazmaniac would beat Scott Taylor. He would go on to make two additional appearances on house shows in New Jersey on June 29 and June 30, losing to Jim Powers on each occasion.

=== Eastern Championship Wrestling / Extreme Championship Wrestling (1993–1999) ===
==== Early years and injury (1993–1995) ====
Wrestling as &quot;The Tazmaniac&quot;, Senerchia debuted in the Philadelphia-based promotion Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) in October 1993 at NWA Bloodfest. He formed a tag team with Joe Chetti (brother of Chris Chetti) called The Tazmaniacs. When that team broke up, he was put into another team with Kevin Sullivan, with whom he won the Tag Team Championship twice. During his second reign as Tag Team Champion with Sullivan, The Tazmaniac became a double champion when he also won the Television Championship for one night in March 1994. For most of the rest of the year he floated around the tag ranks, teaming with different partners. He held the title once more, this time with Sabu, until Sabu was legitimately fired by ECW owner Paul Heyman for no-showing an event in favor of touring Japan for New Japan Pro-Wrestling. In August 1994, The Tazmaniac competed in a one-night eight-man tournament for the vacant NWA World Heavyweight Championship, losing to Shane Douglas in the quarter-finals.

The Tazmaniac was put out of action by a legit injury for much of 1995. On July 20, during a tag team match 2 Cold Scorpio and Dean Malenko delivered a spike piledriver to him, and though he knew it was about to be performed, he did not have time to properly protect himself. As he explained on the DVD documentary &quot;The Rise and Fall of ECW&quot;, &quot;I landed right on my forehead and just jacked my whole neck back and that was it.&quot; The neck injury was so bad that, according to Tommy Dreamer, hospital staff couldn&#x27;t believe he&#x27;d walked into the hospital where he sought help after the match. Though he was unable to wrestle, Paul Heyman continued to pay him per their oral agreement, forging a loyalty between the men.

==== Rise to superstardom (1995–1996) ====
Following his neck injury, Taz made appearances with the Steiner Brothers, even standing in their corner during matches with The Eliminators and getting physical with Jason. It was at the November to Remember event, when Taz turned heel and joined up with referee Bill Alfonso. Working as the special referee for Alfonso&#x27;s match with ECW commissioner Tod Gordon, Taz refused to count to three and assaulted Gordon, then making the count for Alfonso. In his post-match promo, he claimed that no one was looking after him while he was injured and that no one cared (though Heyman was still paying him, the kayfabe story was that he had been forgotten and that Alfonso was the one helping him keep food on his family&#x27;s table). He was also angry that Sabu was brought back in that very night.

Taz returned to the ring on December 19, 1995 at Holiday Hell with a new look and wrestling style. The new character had him clad in a black and orange and exhibiting a more physically intense in-ring style, focusing his offense on mat wrestling and suplexes (inspired by working with The Steiner Brothers), which announcer Joey Styles dubbed &quot;Taz-Plexes&quot;, earning him the nickname &quot;The Human Suplex Machine&quot;. He also debuted his &quot;Tazmission&quot;/Katahajime finishing maneuver, causing opponents to tap out to signal their submission as in mixed martial arts instead of nodding their head or vocally saying &quot;yes&quot;. This quirk was soon picked up by other companies throughout the country. Heading into the summer, Taz began feuding with Tommy Dreamer, joining up with Brian Lee to face Dreamer and Terry Gordy and later Dreamer and &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Steve Williams. Taz also developed a friendship with The Eliminators, based on mutual respect, and they occasionally involved themselves in his matches. Perry Saturn and Taz were both trainers at ECW&#x27;s House of Hardcore wrestling school. For a while, some of the students, including Mako and Chris Chetti, would accompany Taz and Alfonso to the ring as a faction known as Team Taz.

At November to Remember, things seemed to come full circle, as Taz stormed to the ring and interrupted Styles and &quot;stole Paul E.&#x27;s thunder&quot; by announcing that there would be a &quot;big show in the first quarter of the new year&quot;, basically telling the fans in attendance that ECW&#x27;s first pay-per-view was on the horizon. At that &quot;big show&quot;, he guaranteed that Sabu would finally face him. Later that night, he came out to force Scorpio to leave the ring and went on an angry tirade, abusing Bob Artese and holding him hostage in the ring. Taz demanded Sabu come out and face him, and twice even led the crowd in a &quot;Sabu, Sabu&quot; chant to get him to enter the ring. Several officials and wrestlers came out and Taz eventually got his hands on Paul E. The lights went out and when they came back on, Sabu was in the ring, across from Taz. This was the first time they had been in the ring together since early 1995. Before they could lock up, the lights went out again.

During Sabu&#x27;s match, where he teamed with Rob Van Dam to face The Eliminators and The Gangstas in a three-way dance, Taz attempted to attack his former partner, but Van Dam saved Sabu and was choked out in the aisle. This distraction caused Sabu to get hit with &quot;Total Elimination&quot; and his team lost. Taz also began a mini-feud with Rob Van Dam, dominating him in every match and was also out for a short time to get surgery on his injured shoulder. As 1996 ended and 1997 began, Taz and Sabu continued to try getting at one another, with no actual contact.

==== World Television Champion (1997–1998) ====
On February 24, 1997, Taz defeated Mikey Whipwreck on WWF Monday Night Raw as part of the ECW Invasion.

Early in 1997, the antagonism between Sabu and Taz was growing, as Taz attacked Sabu&#x27;s partner, Rob Van Dam, costing the team matches with The Eliminators and other teams. In the months leading to ECW&#x27;s first pay-per-view, Taz would choke out low-level wrestlers with the &quot;Tazmission&quot; due to viewing his matches as secondary to his rivalry with Sabu. He then dominated another series of matches with Van Dam before meeting Sabu at Barely Legal, where Taz defeated him with the &quot;Tazmission&quot;, only to have his manager Bill Alfonso turn on him and join Sabu and his partner Rob Van Dam. In response, Taz began teaming with Chris Candido to face Sabu and Van Dam.

Two months later at Wrestlepalooza, Taz lost to Sabu in the rematch, marking his first loss since 1995. However, later in the night, he won the World Television Championship from Shane Douglas to begin his second reign. He defended the title against all comers, including Douglas, Lance Storm, John Kronus, Al Snow, Jerry Lynn and Chris Candido. Throughout late 1997, Taz began feuding with The Triple Threat in addition to Sabu and Van Dam, where he sometimes teamed up with Tommy Dreamer during the feud. At November to Remember, he issued a challenge to World Heavyweight Champion Bam Bam Bigelow. The two would eventually meet, after Bigelow turned on Taz in a match against Shane Douglas and Chris Candido. Taz would ultimately lose the title to Bam Bam Bigelow at Living Dangerously on March 1, 1998.

==== World Heavyweight Champion; departure (1998–1999) ====
After losing the World Television Championship, Taz was elevated into the World Heavyweight Championship picture. In May 1998, with Shane Douglas injured and unable to wrestle, Taz was given an old World Television Championship belt painted orange—his trademark color—and began cutting promos, declaring himself the FTW Heavyweight Champion at It Ain&#x27;t Seinfeld. Though the championship was unsanctioned in storyline, it was defended at ECW shows until Douglas was healthy. Just before winning the World Heavyweight Championship, Taz &quot;gave&quot; the FTW Heavyweight Title to long-time foe Sabu in a match where he physically pulled Sabu on top of him to allow him to get the pin.

Taz finally defeated Shane Douglas for the World Heavyweight Championship at Guilty as Charged, thus ending Douglas&#x27; year-long reign. Taz was supposed to defend the title against Chris Candido in his first televised title defense at House Party but Douglas attacked Candido before the match and took his place, whom Taz defeated to retain the title in his first successful title defense. He would then begin a feud with Sabu over Taz&#x27;s World Heavyweight Championship and Sabu&#x27;s FTW Heavyweight Championship. The rivalry culminated in a title unification match at the Living Dangerously pay-per-view, where Taz defeated Sabu to unify the FTW Heavyweight Championship into the World Heavyweight Championship. He would begin his next rivalry with Chris Candido, whom he defeated to retain the title at CyberSlam. The two were scheduled to a rematch at Hardcore Heaven, which Taz quickly won. However, he was attacked by Dudley Boyz after the match, leading to a title defense against Buh Buh Ray Dudley in a falls count anywhere match in the main event later that night, which Taz won to retain the title. Taz then successfully defended the title against Candido on the June 4 episode of &quot;Hardcore TV&quot; to end the rivalry.

Taz made his next successful title defense against Spike Dudley in a Falls Count Anywhere match on the June 25 episode of &quot;Hardcore TV&quot;. He would begin feuding with the members of Steve Corino&#x27;s new rising stable, primarily Yoshihiro Tajiri. Taz successfully defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Tajiri at Hostile City Showdown, the Heat Wave pay-per-view and the September 3 episode of &quot;ECW on TNN&quot;. During that time, Taz signed with the World Wrestling Federation, before he losing the ECW title as the first man to be eliminated in a three-way dance by Mike Awesome and Masato Tanaka at Anarchy Rulz. This ended his eight-month reign at 252 days. As he walked out of the ring, a large portion of the ECW locker room joined him on the entrance ramp to give him an emotional sendoff. After being off of ECW television for most of the fall, he wrestled one final match as an ECW performer at November to Remember, losing to Rob Van Dam via pinfall. Taz&#x27;s final televised match in ECW aired on the November 13 episode of &quot;Hardcore TV&quot;, in which he received a rematch against Mike Awesome for the World Heavyweight Championship, which he lost. In the DVD &quot;The Rise and Fall of ECW&quot;, Taz said that he signed with the WWE because he was in the top of the company and he lost his passion.

=== World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment (2000–2009) ===

==== Feud with Jerry Lawler; The Alliance (2000–2002) ====
After being contacted by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1999, Senercia ultimately signed for the WWF, where he was renamed &quot;Tazz&quot;. Beginning in December 1999, what would become Tazz&#x27;s symbol would play on the Titantron during various entrances, and the arena would be shrouded in Tazz&#x27;s signature orange color. Tazz made his in-ring debut in January 2000 at Madison Square Garden at the 2000 Royal Rumble as the surprise opponent of the previously undefeated Kurt Angle, who he defeated with the Tazzmission. Just a few months after Tazz arrived in the WWF, Mike Awesome, the man he had lost the ECW World Heavyweight Championship to at Anarchy Rulz, secretly signed with WCW. Legal wrangling by Paul Heyman prevented Awesome from taking the championship belt with him, and in a bizarre piece of professional wrestling history, ECW and WWF officials agreed to have Tazz, a WWF wrestler, make a surprise appearance at an ECW show to defeat Awesome, a WCW wrestler, for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship. Tazz held the title for ten days before losing it to Tommy Dreamer, during which time he wore it on various WWF shows, and including an episode of &quot;WWF SmackDown!&quot; where he lost to WWF Champion Triple H. However, Vince McMahon later expressed some regret over booking Tazz to lose to Triple H.

After he lost the ECW World Heavyweight Championship at CyberSlam, Tazz was placed into contention for the WWF Intercontinental Championship, but he never won the title. In the summer, after taking time off for an arm injury, he turned heel and placed into a feud with color commentator Jerry Lawler. The feud included matches at SummerSlam and Unforgiven, which they split. Tazz was only able to pick up the Unforgiven win when he received help from Raven, who had returned to the company. Afterwards, the duo formed a tag team that lasted until November.

When the Invasion angle began, Tazz acted as &quot;the voice of The Alliance&quot;, sticking up for them and speaking on their behalf whenever possible. Over the next few weeks, he&#x27;d be beaten up by Stone Cold Steve Austin, made out as the weak link and &quot;the example&quot; needed to be made to the other Alliance members. Despite this mistreatment, Tazz would still speak positively about Austin and The Alliance as a whole while on commentary. He eventually left the stable after he finally stood up to Austin and attacked Paul Heyman in the weeks leading up to Survivor Series, where The Alliance lost to Team WWF.

==== Color commentator; departure (2002–2009) ====
With injuries mounting, Tazz began performing part-time commentary on &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot; in October 2000. His first pay-per-view announcement appearance was during Rebellion in December 2000, announcing alongside Jim Ross. He joined the &quot;SmackDown!&quot; team in February 2001 after Jerry Lawler quit the company, as well as becoming one of the trainers for the joint WWF/MTV produced reality series &quot;Tough Enough&quot;. Lawler returned to the company on November 19, 2001 and resumed his place as commentator, with Tazz becoming both a wrestler and a commentator. In January 2002, he and Spike Dudley won the WWF Tag Team Championship, holding it for over a month before losing it to Billy and Chuck.

When World Wrestling Entertainment split into two brands, Tazz was put on the WWF SmackDown! brand, where he resumed his color commentator duties. Not long after he retired from the ring in June 2002, and he became a full-time broadcaster. He co-hosted &quot;SmackDown!&quot; for World Wrestling Entertainment until a third brand, ECW, was introduced in 2006, at which point he became the color commentator for that show. He was also the co-host, with Joey Styles, of &quot;History of Extreme Championship Wrestling&quot; on WWE 24/7 Classics, a show that re-aired archived episodes of the original ECW&#x27;s weekly television programs. Before and during episodes he and Styles provide insight into the storylines, inner workings, and general ambiance of ECW at the time—as they remember it.

In February 2006, Tazz and his &quot;SmackDown!&quot; broadcasting partner, Michael Cole, hosted a week-long trial run of a show on Howard 101 on Sirius Satellite Radio, but the show was not picked up. He also hosted a talk show on 92.3 Free FM at sporadic intervals between late summer 2006 and early 2007, but it was not picked up and the station changed formats, replacing all post morning programming with music. On June 11, 2006, Taz returned to the ring to squash former rival Jerry Lawler at ECW One Night Stand.

During the recording of the April 29, 2008 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, Tazz&#x27;s broadcast partner Mike Adamle abruptly walked off set prior to the main event. Moments later, after reading the promo for the upcoming pay-per-view, Tazz walked out as well, leaving the main event with no commentators. On December 13, 2010, Tazz joined Right After Wrestling and said that it &quot;pisses him off&quot; when companies try to re-create the original ECW. He stated that the original ECW worked because &quot;It was that era, that group of people, that leader in Paul Heyman. We were that little engine that could.&quot;

In August 2008, Tazz filled in for Mick Foley as a color commentator on the SmackDown brand after Edge attacked Foley in the previous week, while Raw wrestler Matt Striker filled in for Tazz on the ECW brand. When Foley left the company, Tazz became the permanent color commentator for the SmackDown brand once again. On April 3, 2009, WWE announced that Tazz had left WWE when his contract had expired before WrestleMania 25. Two days later after his departure from WWE, his WWE.com profile was moved from the active SmackDown roster list to the alumni list for a short time before being completely removed, and confirming his departure from the company.

In October 2018, Senercia talked about what led to his WWE departure stating &quot;I left on my own terms. My contract was up the week going into WrestleMania, I wasn&#x27;t there. That was it. I was done at the Dallas TV before that...They offered me a new deal, which was a great deal...I had to get out of there...I saw Vince in Dallas and I officially gave word, shook his hand, said I was leaving in Dallas. He and I were crying and hugging, &#x27;I&#x27;m gonna miss you.&#x27; I thanked him for everything. It was great. I remember talking to Stephanie [McMahon] and Triple H……Stephanie was just looking at me, &#x27;I&#x27;m really surprised. Why are you doing this?&#x27; She couldn&#x27;t understand why I would leave. She wasn&#x27;t mean. She wasn&#x27;t disrespectful. &#x27;I need to do this. I appreciate everything you&#x27;ve done for me. There&#x27;s no ill will.&#x27; She was the same way with me. So was Hunter. They were extremely awesome to me; but, like an adult to an adult she was just wondering why and I was, &#x27;I just need a break&#x27;&quot;. In April 2020, Senercia further reflected his other reasons for his WWE departure stating &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to be around anybody named McMahon at that time, They were annoying, and it was the pompous, the arrogance. But the arrogance, not politics, the arrogance. That&#x27;s what I keep saying. That&#x27;s the adjective that keeps jumping out at me. Just the disposition of that elitist attitude, it got to the point where I was like, &#x27;you know what?..I&#x27;m out.&#x27;&quot;

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2009–2015) ===

At Victory Road, Senercia, under his Taz ring name, made his official Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) debut during Samoa Joe&#x27;s match against Sting, revealing himself to be Joe&#x27;s on-screen adviser and consequently a heel as well as an ally of the Main Event Mafia. The match ending was booked as Taz&#x27;s presence enabling Joe to recover from Sting&#x27;s &quot;Scorpion Deathlock&quot; and win the match via submission after applying the &quot;Coquina Clutch&quot;.

On the August 20, 2009 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Taz replaced Don West as the promotion&#x27;s color commentator and also became a face upon stating that he was only loosely associated with the Mafia and that he had taught Joe everything he knew and that it was now up to Joe to use his newfound skills. In May 2012, Taz began appearing as a judge in the monthly TNA Gut Check segment on &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;.

On the January 17, 2013 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Taz was a groomsman at the wedding between Bully Ray and Brooke Hogan. As Ray and Brooke exchanged their vows, Taz interrupted the ceremony and proclaimed himself to be a member of Aces &amp; Eights after revealing a kutte underneath his coat, turning heel again in the process. Following his revelation, Aces &amp; Eights ambushed the ceremony and attacked Ray, his groomsmen Tommy Dreamer and Brother Runt and Brooke&#x27;s father Hulk Hogan. The following week on &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Taz revealed that he joined Aces &amp; Eights because of his desire to be a member of a group that adheres to a higher power. On the November 21 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Aces &amp; Eights was forced to disband after Bully Ray lost to Mr. Anderson, which also saw Anderson retain his career in TNA.

On April 15, 2015, it was officially announced that Taz had departed TNA.

Three days later on April 18, 2015, Taz stated that what led to his TNA departure was that he was asked for his release and he got it and said that it was all professional and he left the proper way. He revealed that his deal was due to expire in the summer anyway and was already looking into alternatives and the way he said it was that he was not going to renew his deal anyway even though TNA wanted him to stay. He confirmed the reports that payments were not coming in and his checks came late and had to do what he had to do. &quot;I did a service, I wasn&#x27;t paid for that service,&quot; Taz said, adding that TNA understood his situation. Once the checks were not coming, he gave TNA his notice and that was it. He said that he would have liked to make a little bit more money but then again everyone felt like that and despite not making the most he was happy from the financial side of things&quot;.

=== WWE (2016) ===
In November 2016, Taz made an appearance on the WWE Network special, &quot;The Authentic Untold Story of ECW&quot;, alongside former ECW management Paul Heyman and wrestlers Bubba Ray Dudley, D-Von Dudley, and Tommy Dreamer. In the one-hour special hosted by Corey Graves, the guests talked about their experiences in ECW and the promotion&#x27;s legacy on professional wrestling.

=== All Elite Wrestling (2019–present) ===

On October 12, 2019, Taz made a guest appearance for All Elite Wrestling (AEW), where he appeared on the October 22 edition of &quot;AEW Dark&quot; as a guest commentator. On November 9, 2019, Taz made his guest appearance during Full Gear as the pre-show commentator. On the January 1, 2020 episode of &quot;AEW Dynamite&quot;, Taz made his &quot;Dynamite&quot; debut on commentary filling in for Tony Schiavone. On January 16, 2020, it was announced that Taz had officially signed a multi-year deal with AEW, and he was made a member of the AEW broadcast team.

At Double or Nothing on May 20, 2020, Taz accompanied newcomer Brian Cage to the ring during the Casino Ladder Match and in what appeared to be the role of a manager, establishing himself as a heel in the process. Cage would win the match, which also made him the number one contender for the AEW World Championship, and Taz celebrated the victory with him afterwards. On Night 2 of Fyter Fest, Taz rewarded Cage with the FTW Championship he held during his later years in ECW. At Fight for the Fallen, Cage lost to Jon Moxley after Taz threw in the towel. Soon after, Taz would recruit Ricky Starks to create a group known as Team Taz along with Cage as they began feuding with Darby Allin. On the November 18, 2020 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Will Hobbs joined Team Taz after hitting Cody Rhodes with Cage&#x27;s FTW championship belt and then helping Taz, Cage and Starks when they attacked Rhodes and Allin.

On August 4, 2021, it was announced that Taz would permanently join the commentary team on &quot;AEW Rampage&quot; beginning August 13, 2021. In June 2022, Taz switched to full-time commentary on &quot;AEW Dynamite&quot;, in a commentary team rotation swap with Jim Ross.

In October 2024, Taz was attacked by an unknown wrestler, later revealed to be Christian Cage of The Patriarchy. This was done to write Taz off of television to allow him to get knee replacement surgery.

== Professional wrestling style, persona and legacy ==
Taz&#x27;s character was influenced by The Missing Link, The Steiner Brothers and The Wild Samoans. Taz is nicknamed the &quot;Human Suplex Machine&quot; due to his wide array of suplex variations he would utilise in matches. His finishing move, the &quot;Tazmission&quot;, is a Katahajime judo chokehold. He also sometimes combined this submission with a suplex, creating a half nelson choke suplex, called the &quot;Tazmission-Plex&quot;. He has also claimed to have named the T-Bone Suplex. When Taz was signed by WWF, other wrestlers complained to Vince McMahon about his style, calling him dangerous and didn&#x27;t want to work with him. However, Kurt Angle defended Taz, saying that &quot;Taz was never dangerous with his suplexes&quot;.

== Personal life ==
 Senerchia is of Italian descent. He is the cousin of fellow retired professional wrestler Chris Chetti. Senerchia is married to Teresa Smith, and together they have one son, Tyler Cole (born May 4, 1999), who is also a professional wrestler better known under the ring name Hook. Tyler has trained with Cody Rhodes and made several appearances in AEW as part of his father&#x27;s stable Team Taz, debuting in action on December 10, 2021.

Senerchia has a tattoo of the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; character Tasmanian Devil on his upper right biceps, which he states he got after being inspired by an identical tattoo sported by Road Warrior Animal. He also has a self-designed tattoo on his left lower bicep.

Senerchia played high school football, as well as in college, playing for the LIU Post Pioneers. He also studied judo prior to entering the professional wrestling circuit, reaching a second-degree black belt. He is a supporter of the New York Mets, New York Knicks, Philadelphia 76ers, New York Islanders, and the Buffalo Bills.

===Legal issues===
In September 1998, Senerchia was arrested on charges of indecent exposure and contributing to the delinquency of a child after allegedly exposing himself to a 15 year-old salon worker during a massage. The charges were dropped in October 1999.

==Other media==
Beginning in 2018, Senerchia was a nationally syndicated morning radio personality, co-hosting &quot;Taz and The Moose&quot; with Marc &quot;The Moose&quot; Malusis on CBS Sports Radio weekdays from 6-9 a.m. Eastern. In December 2019, Senerchia announced he was leaving the show.

Senerchia also had his own podcast, called &quot;The Taz Show&quot; (formerly known as &quot;The Human Podcast Machine)&quot;, where he discusses the latest in the professional wrestling world. The show has since discontinued.

Senerchia (as Taz) appears as a playable character in &quot;ECW Hardcore Revolution&quot;, &quot;WWF No Mercy, WWF SmackDown! 2: Know Your Role&quot;, WWE WrestleMania X8 (video game)&quot;, &quot;WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It&quot;, &quot;WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth&quot;, &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007&quot; and &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009&quot;.

<doc id="674622" wikidata="Q2887395" url="?curid=674622" title="Bassendean, Western Australia">
<text>Bassendean (once referred to as West Guildford) is a north-eastern suburb of Perth, Western Australia. Its local government area is the Town of Bassendean.

It is also the name of the sand dune system on the Swan Coastal Plain known as the &quot;Bassendean Dune System&quot;.

==History==
In 1829, the land along the Swan River was allotted to British settlers as they arrived in the newly created Swan River Colony. James Henty and his brothers were granted 2,000 acres upon which they grazed their livestock and built a mud-brick homestead. They called their property &quot;Stoke Farm&quot;. In 1832, the Henty brothers sold the farm to the Colonial Secretary, Peter Broun who renamed the homestead &quot;Bassendean&quot;.

Over the years the Bassendean property became incorporated into the suburb of West Guildford and in 1922, West Guildford was renamed Bassendean. Flooding in 1929 caused severe damage, especially to the primary school oval.

In December 1934, Bassendean Road Board held a referendum, seeking approval to borrow funds for the improvement of an area, known as Hays Swamp, on the edge of the townsite. The development would include a bowling green with floodlights, a croquet lawn, Bassendean Oval, tennis courts and provisions for other sports.

==Rail heritage==
Bassendean is home to the Western Australian Rail Transport Museum which opened in 1974. The display has a collection of steam and diesel locomotives, some of which have been restored to operating conditions. Also as part of the collection are a number of carriages and other equipment associated including the Zanthus station and a signal box from Perth station. The West Australian Model Railway Club is also housed within the complex. The display&#x27;s centrepiece is a working scale model featuring engine characters from the children&#x27;s series &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends&quot;.

==Facilities==
Cyril Jackson Senior High School was built in 1962, and was converted into Cyril Jackson Senior Campus in 1990 to provide specialised study for post high school students gaining entrance into university study. Bassendean railway station is served by Transperth Midland line services.

<doc id="674627" wikidata="Q468871" url="?curid=674627" title="Rob Estes">
<text>Rob Estes (born July 22, 1963) is an American actor. He is known for his roles as Harry Wilson on the teen drama series &quot;90210&quot;, as Sgt. Chris Lorenzo on the crime drama series &quot;Silk Stalkings&quot;, and as Kyle McBride on the primetime soap opera &quot;Melrose Place&quot;.

== Career ==
Estes first became interested in an acting career while training to be a stunt double. One of his first acting jobs was in the soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; playing Glenn Gallagher (1986–1987). He later gained widespread recognition for his role as Sergeant Chris Lorenzo in &quot;Silk Stalkings&quot; (1991–1995), half of the &quot;dynamic duo&quot; alongside Mitzi Kapture.

In 1993, Estes had a guest role on the prime time Fox soap opera &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, playing Sam Towler. Three years later, the producers of the series brought him back but cast him in a different role, that of restaurateur Kyle McBride. Estes played the role from 1996 to the series&#x27; cancellation in 1999.

Following &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, he had guest starring roles on &quot;Providence&quot;, &quot;Suddenly Susan&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; and &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;. He also performed in theater, and had roles in &quot;Same Time, Next Year&quot; (2004) and &quot;The Lake&quot; (2005).

Estes starred in the comedy film &quot;I Do, They Don&#x27;t&quot; (previously titled &quot;Blended&quot;), which premiered on ABC Family in March 2005 and also starred his &quot;Melrose Place&quot; co-star and then-wife Josie Bissett. He made his return to series television playing Sean Cole in the ABC television crime drama &quot;The Evidence&quot;.

He completed a recurring role on &quot;&quot; as Nick Townsend, the abusive ex-husband of Natalia Boa Vista. In a January 2007 episode, he was murdered by the husband of a killer to cover up her crime.

Estes then portrayed Lieutenant Tom Hogan, Inspector Lindsay Boxer&#x27;s ex-husband and current boss in the ABC police procedural and legal drama &quot;Women&#x27;s Murder Club&quot;.

In May 2008, Estes was cast as Harry Wilson in &quot;90210&quot; on The CW. The series, like &quot;Melrose Place&quot; before it, is a spin-off from the original 1990s series &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, marking Estes&#x27; third appearance in the franchise.

On January 20, 2010, Estes announced that the second season of &quot;90210&quot; would be his last. &quot;This is my final season on &quot;90210&quot; and I wish the show, cast and crew nothing but the best. I am looking forward to spending time with my kids and exploring other opportunities&quot;, Estes said in a statement.

== Personal life ==

On May 1, 1992, Estes married actress Josie Bissett, another cast member of &quot;Melrose Place&quot;. In 2005, they separated, with Estes reportedly moving out of their Seattle home at his wife&#x27;s request. The couple have two children together, son Mason (born 1999/2000) and daughter Maya (born 2002/2003). In January 2006 the couple announced their plans to divorce.

On June 15, 2010, after a few years living together, Estes married teacher and surfer Erin Bolte. , after repeated moves, including return stays, between Santa Monica, Seattle and San Clemente, Estes and his wife had settled in San Clemente with Mason and the child they have together, son Makai (born 2011).

<doc id="674629" wikidata="Q5424795" url="?curid=674629" title="Final Conflict (band)">
<text>Final Conflict are a British neo-prog band based in Staffordshire.

==Band members==
Current line-up (as of November 2015)
*Brian Donkin - Vocals, guitars
*Andy Lawton - Vocals, guitars
*Steve Lipiec - Keyboards, saxophone, backing vocals
*Barry Elwood - Bass, guitars, backing vocals

==History==
Final Conflict were formed in 1985, by Andy Lawton and Brian Donkin. After the release of two cassette albums the band was signed by Gaia Records and the band&#x27;s first CD album &quot;Redress the Balance&quot; (1991) was released, based around an ecological theme and featuring a number of guest musicians.

The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Quest&quot; (1992), was inspired by crossword compiler Leonard Dawe, who in 1944 inadvertently leaked code words from Operation Overlord in a crossword for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; newspaper. The album is about an ordinary man like Dawe imagining he is on trial for the failings in his life.

The third album, &quot;Stand Up&quot;, delayed by the withdrawal of funding by the band&#x27;s original record label, finally appeared in 1997. Again the album was based on a loose concept, this time the stresses of modern living, culminating in the 15-minute epic, &quot;Stop&quot;, about urban decay and the rise of violent crime.

The band released a fourth album, &quot;Hindsight&quot;, in 2003. This album benefited from advances in recording technology, which allowed the band to produce a professional quality recording in its own Gaolhouse recording studio.

Their fifth album, &quot;Simple&quot; was released in 2006. Recorded to celebrate 21 years of involvement in music, the album comprised new recordings of songs from their early cassette albums and the first two CD albums, along with new material.

Final Conflict&#x27;s success was acknowledged in 2007, when they were nominated in 5 categories at The Classic Rock Society&#x27;s Band Of The Year awards. They were voted second best band and Henry Rogers was second best drummer. In 2008, at the same awards, they were presented with the MD&#x27;s award by Steve Hackett of Genesis.

February 2009 saw the release of Final Conflict&#x27;s first live DVD and CD. They are grateful to Metal Mind Productions for providing them with this fantastic opportunity. The DVD &amp; CD are entitled &quot;Another Moment in Time&quot;. Metal Mind also released a special limited edition remaster of the band&#x27;s classic album &quot;Stand Up&quot; which includes previously unreleased bonus tracks.

In December 2012 the band released their sixth studio album &quot;Return of the Artisan&quot;, to extensive critical acclaim. Return Of The Artisan is the first part of the Artisan trilogy.

The band released part two of the Artisan trilogy &quot;The Rise Of The Artisan&quot; in 2020, along with a fully remastered version of Return Of The Artisan.

The band are currently working on the third and final album of the Artisan trilogy, provisionally entitled &quot;The Artisan Legacy&quot;.

<doc id="674633" wikidata="Q3714504" url="?curid=674633" title="Gartner's duct">
<text>Gartner&#x27;s duct, also known as Gartner&#x27;s canal or the ductus longitudinalis epoophori, is a potential embryological remnant in human female development of the mesonephric duct in the development of the urinary and reproductive organs. It was discovered and described in 1822 by Hermann Treschow Gartner.

Gartner&#x27;s duct is located in the uterus&#x27; broad ligament. Its position is parallel with the lateral uterine tube and lateral walls of vagina and cervix.

The paired mesonephric ducts in the male, in contrast, go on to form the paired epididymides, vasa deferentia, ejaculatory ducts and seminal vesicles.

In females, they may persist between the layer of the broad ligament of the uterus and in the wall of the vagina.

==Clinical significance==
These may give rise to Gartner&#x27;s duct cysts.

<text>The City of Bayswater is a local government area in the Western Australian capital city of Perth, about northeast of Perth&#x27;s central business district. The city covers an area of and had a population of 69,283 as at the 2021 Census. The City of Bayswater is a member of the Eastern Metropolitan Regional Council.

==History==
In the 1890s, Bayswater was a small settlement, awkwardly straddling the boundaries of the Perth and Swan Road Districts. In December 1894, residents held a meeting to petition for a road board. The government rejected the petition. A second attempt to get Bayswater&#x27;s own road board in 1896 was successful. Both the Perth and Swan Road Boards were happy to relinquish responsibility for building roads there. The Bayswater Road Board was gazetted on 5 March 1897, becoming one of several new local government areas established in the 1890s along the railway. A wooden ratepayers&#x27; hall was constructed on Guildford Road.

In 1944, at the annual ratepayers&#x27; meeting, a majority of the seven ratepayers that attended voted for the board to change the district&#x27;s name to &quot;Oakleigh Park Road District&quot;. The name Bayswater was considered to obstruct progress due to its working-class connotations. After advertising for objections to the change in name, many came in and the idea was ditched. On 1 July 1961, it became a shire following the enactment of the &quot;Local Government Act 1960&quot;.

In October 1978, the shire council was sacked by the Government of Western Australia for mismanagement, corruption and various actions breaking the Local Government Act. The shire sold council property and several large contracts without tenders. A commissioner was placed in charge of the council for five months. At the next council election on 24 February 1979, 80% of ratepayers voted, much higher than the usual 30%. Only two of the councillors elected had been councillors before.

On 29 October 1983, it attained city status. Around this same time, it relocated its administration from Bayswater to its present location on Broun Avenue in Morley. In 1998 the suburb of Maylands was transferred into the City of Bayswater from the City of Stirling.

The portion of the suburb of Noranda north of Widgee Road was transferred to the City of Bayswater from the City of Swan on 1 July 2016.

==Logo==

The City of Bayswater&#x27;s logo features an olive tree, which has history relating to Bayswater. In the 1840s, an olive tree was planted on Slade Street. The tree is still standing today, and it is the earliest sign of European occupation in the area.

==Services==
The City of Bayswater has three libraries. They are in Maylands, Bayswater and Morley. The city also owns The RISE, Bayswater Waves, Maylands Waterland and Morley Sport and Recreation Centre.

==Wards==
The city is divided into four wards. The mayor and deputy mayor are each elected from among the councillors. Elections are held on the third Saturday in October every odd year, with councillors elected to four-year terms. Approximately half of all positions are up for election at each election.

Political parties do not typically endorse candidates in local government in Western Australia. However, elected members are required to disclose membership of any political party.

<doc id="674639" wikidata="Q1678024" url="?curid=674639" title="Neophobia">
<text>Neophobia is the fear of anything new, especially a persistent and abnormal fear. In its milder form, it can manifest as the unwillingness to try new things or break from routine. In the context of children the term is generally used to indicate a tendency to reject unknown or novel foods. Food neophobia, as it may be referred to, is an important concern in pediatric psychology.

In biomedical research, neophobia is often associated with the study of taste.

==Terminology==
The word &quot;neophobia&quot; comes from the Greek νέος, &quot;neos&quot;, meaning &quot;new, young&quot;, and φόβος, &quot;phobos&quot;, for &quot;fear&quot;. &quot;Cainophobia&quot; comes from the Greek καινός, &quot;kainos&quot;, meaning &quot;new, fresh&quot;. Alternative terms for neophobia include metathesiophobia, prosophobia, cainotophobia (or cainophobia), and kainophobia (or kainolophobia).

==Examples==
Norway rats and house mice are thought to have evolved increased levels of neophobia as they became commensal with humans because humans were routinely devising new methods (e.g., mousetraps) to eradicate them.

Neophobia is also a common finding in aging animals, although apathy could also explain, or contribute to explain, the lack of exploratory drive systematically observed in aging. Researchers argued that the lack of exploratory drive was likely due neurophysiologically to the dysfunction of neural pathways connected to the prefrontal cortex observed during aging.

Robert Anton Wilson theorized in his book &quot;Prometheus Rising&quot; that neophobia is instinctual in people after they begin to raise children. Wilson&#x27;s views on neophobia are mostly negative, believing that it is the reason human culture and ideas do not advance as quickly as our technology. His model includes an idea from Thomas Kuhn&#x27;s &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;, which is that new ideas, however well proven and evident, are implemented only when the generations who consider them &quot;new&quot; die and are replaced by generations who consider the ideas accepted and old.

==Food neophobia==
Food neophobia in humans has been described as the fear of eating new or unfamiliar foods. It is a common symptom of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder but is not in itself a disorder. Food neophobia is particularly common in toddlers and young children. It is often related to an individual&#x27;s level of sensation-seeking, meaning a person&#x27;s willingness to try new things and take risks. Not only do people with high food neophobia resist trying new food, they also rate new foods that they do try as lower than neophilics. Picky eating has been a cause of concern for many parents of young children. This results in leaving parents feeling frustrated, and risk compounding parental anxieties. Parents tend to worry about the growth and lack of nutrient in their child. Pediatricians and family physicians are always there to teach parents and care givers different ways to feed their children effectively.

It is very typical for people to generally have a fear of new things and to prefer things that are familiar and common. Most people experience food neophobia to a certain extent, though some people are more neophobic than others. A measure of individual differences in food neophobia is the Food Neophobia Scale (FNS), which consists of a 10-item survey that requires self-reported responses on a seven-point Likert scale. There is also a separate scale geared towards children called the Food Neophobia Scale for Children (FNSC), in which the parents actually do the reporting for the survey.

In animals it has been shown that food neophobia is a fear of novelty lasting only a short duration (minutes at most), which is distinct from dietary conservatism, the prolonged refusal to add a novel food to the diet, which can last many days or even years. Dietary conservatism has never yet been demonstrated in humans, although the genetically influenced behaviour of &quot;fussy eating&quot; in children resembles the behaviour seen in animals.

Food neophobia relates to the omnivore&#x27;s dilemma, a phenomenon that explains the choice that omnivores, and humans in particular, have between eating a new food and risking danger or avoiding it and potentially missing out on a valuable food source. Having at least some degree of food neophobia has been noted to be evolutionarily advantageous as it can help people to avoid eating potentially poisonous foods.

=== Causes ===
Genetics seem to play a role in both food neophobia and general neophobia. Research shows that about two-thirds of the variation in food neophobia is due to genetics. A study done on twin pairs showed an even higher correlation, indicating that genetics do play a factor in food neophobia.

Psychosocial factors can also increase a child&#x27;s chances of developing food neophobia. Young children carefully watch parental food preferences, and this may produce neophobic tendencies with regard to eating if parents tend to avoid some foods.

Another cause includes being more sensitive than average to bitter tastes, which may be associated with a significant history of middle ear infection or an increased perception of bitter foods, known as a supertaster.

===Treatment===
Some efforts to address this situation, such as pressuring the child to eat a disliked food or threatening punishment for not eating it, tend to exacerbate the problem.

Effective solutions include offering non-food rewards, such as a small sticker, for tasting a new or disliked food, and for parents to model the behavior they want to see by cheerfully eating the new or disliked foods in front of the children.

Exposing someone to a new food increases the chances of liking that food item. However, it is not enough to merely look at a new food. Novel food must be repeatedly tasted in order to increase preference for eating it. It can take as many as 15 tries of a novel food item before a child accepts it. There also appears to be a critical period for lowering later food neophobia in children during the weaning process. The variety of solid foods first exposed to children can lower later food refusal. Some researchers believe that even the food variety of a nursing mother and the consequent variety of flavors in her breastmilk can lead to greater acceptance of novel food items later on in life. Food neophobia does tend to naturally decrease as people age.

<text>The City of Belmont is a local government area in the inner eastern suburbs of the Western Australian capital city of Perth, located about east of Perth&#x27;s central business district on the south bank of the Swan River. The City covers an area of , maintains 225 km of roads and had a population of approximately 42,000 as at the 2021 Census.

Belmont contains Perth&#x27;s domestic and international airports which account for 33.7% of the City of Belmont&#x27;s land area.

==History==
The Belmont Road District was created on 2 December 1898. On 4 October 1907, it was renamed Belmont Park. From 1906 until 1909, Burswood Island was part of the district.

On 1 July 1961, the Belmont Park Road District became the Shire of Belmont following the enactment of the &quot;Local Government Act 1960&quot;. On 17 February 1979 it attained city status.

Ascot and Belmont are suburbs long associated with horses, being close to the race tracks (see Ascot Racecourse and Belmont Park). Until 1956 the Belmont Spur Railway linked Bayswater on the Perth to Midland line to the Ascot race track.

==Wards==
The city is divided into four wards: East Ward, West Ward, Central Ward, and South Ward, each represented by two councillors. Previously, the Mayor and Deputy Mayor were elected from among the councillors. In 2023, voters elected Robert Rossi, former West Ward Councillor and Deputy Mayor, as the city&#x27;s first popularly elected Mayor. He won the election from a field of five candidates.
Elections are held on the third Saturday in October every odd year, with councillors elected to four year terms. Approximately half of all positions are up for election at each election.

Political parties do not typically endorse candidates in local government in Western Australia. However, elected members are required to disclose membership of any political party.

<text>Macon () is a village of Wallonia and a district of the municipality of Momignies, located in the province of Hainaut, Belgium.

The town has approximately 500 people, and is about 10 miles west of Chimay, near the French border. Nearby lies the site where the first U.S. troops began to liberate Belgium during World War II. A memorial stands near Macon at the point where soldiers of the First Army crossed from France into Belgium. The town is centered on St. Jean the Baptist Church, and a Linden Tree, several centuries old, sits in the church square, and is supported by braces originally built in the 17th century by Monsieur DeCuir.

<text>Godfrey Giffard ( 12351302) was Chancellor of the Exchequer of England, Lord Chancellor of England and Bishop of Worcester.

==Early life==
Giffard was a son of Hugh Giffard of Boyton in Wiltshire, a royal justice, by Sibyl, a daughter and co-heiress of Walter de Cormeilles. He was born about 1235 and was the younger brother of Walter Giffard, who was to become Archbishop of York and whose successful career ensured the preferment of Godfrey. His sister Mabel was the abbess of Shaftesbury Abbey.

==Career==
Giffard appears to have profited from his brother&#x27;s position, and held the following positions:

*Canon of Wells
*Rector of Mells.
*Rector of the greater moiety of Attleborough in Norfolk
*Archdeacon of Barnstaple between 1265 and 1267, and (after Walter later became archbishop of York)
*Archdeacon of York
*Chancellor of the exchequer
*Chancellor of England and
*Rector of Adlingfleet in 1267

Complaints were later made to the Pope at Rome about the way in which the Archbishop had given this and many other benefices to his brother – as Godfrey was it was claimed, &quot;...only in minor orders and deficient in learning&quot;.

==Bishop of Worcester==
Giffard was still Chancellor when the monks of Worcester elected him as Bishop of Worcester about between 2 and 24 May 1268, on the translation of Bishop Nicholas of Ely to the See of Winchester. Henry III accepted his appointment, and he received the temporalities on 13 June 1268. After some little resistance, Archbishop Boniface of Savoy confirmed his election, but it was not until 23 September that he was consecrated by the archbishop at Canterbury and he was enthroned in Worcester Cathedral on Christmas Day 1268.

Giffard retained the chancellorship until October 1268, and in 1268 received a grant of five hundred marks a year for the support of himself and the clerks of the chancery.

In 1272 Giffard acted with Roger de Meyland Bishop of Lichfield in treating with Llywelyn ap Gruffudd of Wales. In May 1273 he was sent abroad with Nicholas of Ely, Bishop of Winchester, and Walter Bronescomb, Bishop of Exeter, to meet King Edward I on his return from the Holy Land. He was made a commissioner along with Roger Mortimer to investigate certain grievances of the Oxford scholars, and in 1278 acted as an itinerant justice in Hertfordshire and Kent.

In 1279 Giffard succeeded to the very extensive property of his brother the Archbishop of York. He was also one of the four negotiators selected in 1289 by King Edward I of England to treat at Salisbury with the Scottish and Norwegian envoys about sending Margaret of Norway to Scotland.

Giffard ruled over the See of Worcester for more than thirty-three years, and his activities were almost confined to his own diocese.

==Activities as bishop==
Giffard was engaged in many disputes with his monastic cathedral chapter, long accounts of which, written from the monks&#x27; point of view, have survived in the &quot;Annals of Worcester&quot;. One main area of disagreement was whether or not the Bishop should be allowed to annex some of the more valuable livings in his gift, to the prebends of the college at Westbury. This dispute led to some tedious litigation which was ultimately decided in favour of the monks. However, the claim of the Bishop that he was entitled to receive the monks&#x27; ‘profession’ produced still more lawsuits. In 1288, at an ordination at Westbury, an unseemly dispute arose between the precentor of Worcester and John of Evreux, the then Archdeacon of Gloucester (he was a favourite nephew of the Bishop) as to who had the right to call over the names of the candidates and which led to the expulsion of the precentor from the chancel with the connivance of the Bishop.

Some time later a truce patched matters up, but at Bromsgrove the Bishop, &quot;...would not permit the prior to exercise his office, regardless of the peace that had been made, which we believe to have been as vain as a peace with the Welsh.&quot; The monks also complained of his depriving them of the chapel at Grafton and of his constant efforts to visit and to exercise jurisdiction over them. In 1290 he held a visitation, and required the convent to support his 140 horses leaving the place in anger.

Giffard was also involved in another great dispute with the Abbot of Westminster after he had deposed William of Ledbury, the Prior of Malvern, for &quot;gross crimes&quot;. The monks of Westminster took up William&#x27;s cause, as Malvern was a cell of their Abbey, and they also obtained the support of the King. In the end Giffard was glad to compromise the case, and received a grant of land at Knightwick and agreed not to visit Malvern as his predecessors had done and Ledbury was restored.

However, this settlement was attacked by Archbishop Peckham as being simoniacal. Giffard had already been involved, like the other suffragans to Canterbury, in the struggle against Peckham&#x27;s excessive claims of metropolitical jurisdiction; he however later more friendly with him, and sent the Archbishop many expensive gifts.

Giffard&#x27;s many favours to the Franciscans, whose General had in both 1277 and 1282, admitted him as a brother of the order, must have procured him the friendship of the Franciscan primate. However his remissness in allowing the monks of the cathedral to steal the body of one Henry Poche from the Franciscans and bury it in their churchyard in 1290 was another new source of friction.

By the year 1300 Giffard had become sick and infirm; in March of that year he was visited by Archbishop Winchelsey at Wyke. In 1301, William of Gloucester produced thirty-six articles against him before the Archbishop; although mostly small, technical and legal, they included:
*A charge of manumitting serfs without its consent.
*Another complaint of him unduly favouring his nephews.
Both complaints were well investigated, and the Bishop&#x27;s answers are recorded along with the charges in his register.

==Death and legacy==
Giffard died on Friday 26 January 1302, and was buried on 4 February by John de Monmouth, Bishop of Llandaff, in Worcester Cathedral, on the south side of the altar of the lady chapel; his tomb remains there still.

Under the terms of Giffard&#x27;s will, which was dated 13 September 1300, he left a large number of legacies to his kinsfolk, including his sister Mabel, Abbess of Shaftesbury, and to various churches.

Giffard&#x27;s heir was his nephew John, who was the son of his brother William Giffard and who after fighting on the baronial side at Boroughbridge, was hanged at Gloucester, thus forfeiting his estates to the Crown. However, these estates were later restored, and subsequently the Giffords of Weston-sub-Edge assumed the arms of the See of Worcester in memory of their ancestor.

Despite his long running quarrels with the chapter at Worcester, Giffard was a benefactor of his Cathedral; during his reign he beautified the pillars of both the choir and lady chapel by interlacing them with smaller pillars and in 1280 he laid the first stone of the pavement of the cathedral.

Giffard also sought leave to fortify and finish Hartlebury Castle which Bishop Cantelupe had begun. He extracted from the Bishop&#x27;s executors a legacy which had been left to the See, for supplying a stock of cattle on the lands of the Bishopric.

Giffard also obtained a &quot;grant of fairs&quot; to Stratford-on-Avon and Blockley and secured permission to fortify his palaces at Worcester and Wydindon as he had done at Hartlebury.

<text>The Town of Cambridge is a local government area in the inner western suburbs of the Western Australian capital city of Perth, about west of Perth&#x27;s central business district and extending to the Indian Ocean at City Beach. The Town covers an area of and had a population of almost 29,000 as of the 2021 Census. It was originally part of the City of Perth before the restructuring by the Western Australian State Government in 1994.

==History==
Historically the area was part of the North Perth municipality, gazetted in 1901, which was absorbed into the City of Perth in 1915 after becoming unsustainable as an autonomous political entity. In 1993, the Government of Western Australia decided to split up the local government area (LGA) of the City of Perth, creating three additional LGAs and retaining a smaller City of Perth. The new LGAs were Town of Vincent, Town of Cambridge and the Town of Victoria Park.

In October 2020, the Town won an injunction against the state government&#x27;s efforts to suspend the Council due to suspicions of interference in Town administration. This was the first time a local government in Western Australia successfully challenged ministerial authority to suspend a Council.

==Parks and reserves==
Cambridge has many parks and reserves. The Town has two major reserves, Lake Monger and Perry Lakes, as well as 4.8 km of coastline, including City Beach and Floreat Beach and their respective parks, and the nearby dunes.

==Wards==
The city has been divided into two wards, each electing four councillors.

* Coast Ward 
* Wembley Ward

<text>Epiphone () is an American musical instrument brand that traces its roots to a musical instrument manufacturing business founded in 1873 by Anastasios Stathopoulos in İzmir, Ottoman Empire, and moved to New York City in 1908. After taking over his father&#x27;s business, Epaminondas Stathopoulos named the company &quot;Epiphone&quot; as a combination of his own nickname &quot;Epi&quot; and the suffix &quot;&quot; (from Greek &quot;phon-&quot;, &quot;voice&quot;) in 1928, the same year it began making guitars. From the 1930s through to the early 1950s, Epiphone produced a range of both acoustic and (later) electrified archtop guitars that rivalled those produced by Gibson and were the instruments of choice of many professionals; a smaller range of flat-top guitars were also produced, some designations of which were later continued during the Gibson-owned era for the company.

In 1957 Epiphone, Inc. was purchased by Gibson, its main rival in the archtop guitar market at the time. Gibson relocated Epiphone&#x27;s manufacturing operation from its original Queens, New York, factory to Gibson&#x27;s Kalamazoo, Michigan, factory, where production of both ranges took place until 1969, with Epiphone instruments—some with &quot;sister&quot; models in the Gibson line, some unique to the Epiphone line—generally considered equal in construction quality to those produced under the Gibson brand. From 1970 onwards, Gibson ceased production of Epiphones in its U.S.A factory and moved production offshore for a range of cheaper models. Today, Epiphone is still used as a brand for the Gibson company, both for budget models of other Gibson-branded products and for several Epiphone-exclusive models. Aside from guitars, Epiphone has also made double basses, banjos, and other string instruments, as well as amplifiers.

== History ==
Epiphone began in 1873, in Smyrna, Ottoman Empire (now İzmir, Turkey), where Greek founder Anastasios Stathopoulos made his own fiddles and lutes (specifically, the oud and the laouto). Stathopoulos moved to the United States in 1903 and continued to make his original instruments, as well as mandolins, from a factory at 35-37 36th Street in Long Island City, Queens, New York. Anastasios died in 1915, and his son, Epaminondas (&quot;Epi&quot;), took over.

After two years, the company became known as &quot;The House of Stathopoulo&quot;. Just after the end of World War I, the company started to make banjos. The company produced its recording line of banjos in 1924 and, four years later, took on the name of the &quot;Epiphone Banjo Company&quot;. It produced its first guitars (the &quot;Epiphone Recording&quot; models) in 1928. In 1931 the company commenced production of its &quot;Masterbilt&quot; range of archtop guitars which became very popular and competed successfully with the equivalent range produced at the time by Gibson, its main rival in the archtop market. After Epi died in 1943, control of the company went to his brothers, Orphie and Frixo. In 1951, a four-month-long strike caused a relocation of Epiphone Headquarters from New York City to Philadelphia. A number of Epiphone employees decided to remain in New York rather than relocate to Philadelphia, and spearheaded by George Mann, former Epiphone Vice President and Secretary, formed the nucleus of the new Guild Guitar Company, whose early archtop guitar designs owed a lot to Epiphone.

In 1957 the company was acquired by Gibson parent company CMI, who merged Epiphone operations with Gibson. Between 1957 and 1969, the Gibson-owned production of Epiphone instruments took a parallel path to those marketed under the Gibson brand, with many equivalents between the two lines but also some instruments unique to the Epiphone range. The marketing strategy used was that since the number of Gibson dealerships was limited by design, equivalent quality instruments under the Epiphone label could be offered for sale through other dealerships thus in principle increasing market share overall. This arrangement lasted until 1969 at which point Gibson decided to cease production of the high grade, U.S.A.-made Epiphone instruments in favour of a cheaper range of lower grade instruments still bearing the Epiphone label, but now sourced in Japan.

By the late 1970s, Epiphone production began moving to Korea, and by the mid-1980s, all Epiphones were Korean-built. Beginning in 1997, Epiphone moved its production to China and Indonesia. Since merging with Gibson, the brand has been used for a number of different guitars, some manufactured by Gibson itself in its own factories, and some manufactured by other companies such as Matsumoku under contract to Gibson and marketed under the Epiphone brand.

===Guitars===
====Pre-Gibson era====

Epiphone&#x27;s first foray into the guitar market came in around 1928, with the release of the &quot;Recording&quot; range, styled models A through E. These guitars featured an unusual asymmetric body shape with what was in effect a strongly sloping cutaway on the upper treble bout, and either a trapeze tailpiece or a pin bridge, together with pegheads and tuners reminiscent of the company&#x27;s banjos. The cheapest model, the A, featured a flat top and back, the B had an arched back and a flat top, while the remainder had arched tops and backs; additionally, they appear to have been available in two different sizes. These guitars had a distinctive sound but were not very successful commercially, and are rarely seen today.

Commencing around 1931, Epiphone decided to release a new range of full body archtop guitars in direct competition with Gibson, the leading factory manufacturer of archtop guitars of the day. The newly announced &quot;Masterbilt&quot; series comprised the Deluxe (with its tenor version named the Empire), Broadway (tenor version the Bretton, later named the Broadway Tenor), Triumph (tenor version the Hollywood, later the Triumph Tenor), Royal, Spartan (tenor version the Regent, later the Spartan Tenor), Blackstone, Zenith (tenor version the Melody, later the Zenith Tenor), Olympic, and Beverly. Other models introduced a little later comprised the Emperor (1936), Byron (1938), Ritz (1941) and Devon (1951). These instruments were initially offered in acoustic, non-cutaway form, with cutaways appearing (often with the additional designation &quot;Regent&quot;) from the late 1940s onwards, and with the addition of pickups, by the added designation of &quot;Zephyr&quot;, thus an &quot;Zephyr Emperor Regent&quot; would indicate the (top of the line) Emperor model with added cutaway and pickups. Other archtops appeared solely in the amplified form, being the Zephyr, Century and Coronet (all 1939), Kent (1950) and a signature model named for Harry Volpe (1955).

Accompanying the archtop line were a range of flat top instruments, although these never acquired the cachet of their archtop companions. These included 2 Hawaiian models (the Madrid and the Navarre), plus the flat top FT 75 (introduced by 1935, discontinued 1942), FT 37 (1935-1942), FT 27 (1935-1941), FT De Luxe (1939-1942), FT 110, FT 79 and FT 45 (all 1942, all continued into Gibson era), FT 50 (1941-1950) and FT 30 (1941-1954, then reactivated in the Gibson era). Several cutaway flat top instruments were also made, designated the De Luxe Cutaway (also as the FT 210) and the Zephyr Cutaway. It seems that Epiphone used ladder- rather than X-bracing for the tops of their flat top models, which may account for their less success in the market than comparable instruments by the Martin and Gibson guitar companies.

====Gibson (Kalamazoo) era====

Following Epiphone&#x27;s purchase by Gibson in 1957, the lines of both electric and acoustic guitars were considerably revamped, with the introduction of new thinline hollow-body (semi-acoustic) guitars, solidbody electric guitars, and a much improved range of flat-top acoustic guitars, incorporating elements of Gibson&#x27;s own designs. The 1961 catalog shows that the Emperor, Deluxe, Triumph and Zenith were still available as acoustic archtops, the Emperor, Sheraton, Broadway, Zephyr and Century together with new models the Windsor, Casino and Sorrento as electric archtops, the new models Crestwood Custom, Wilshire, Coronet and Olympic as electric solidbodies, while the acoustic range comprised the Seville (a nylon string instrument), and the steel string Frontier (continuation of FT 110), Texan (continuation of FT 79), Cortez (continuation of FT 45) and Caballero (continuation of FT 30). Subsequent additions to these lines included the semi-acoustic Granada, Professional and Riviera models (all introduced 1962); as well as artist-endorsed models for Al Caiola (the &quot;Caiola&quot;, introduced 1963) and Howard Roberts (1964), the latter with an unusual oval shaped soundhole. The Riviera was also available in a 12-string version (1965 onwards). New acoustic instruments comprised the Excellente, El Dorado, Troubador and Folkster, along with new &quot;folk oriented&quot; 12-strings the Bard (1962) and Serenader (1963); additions to the classical line comprised the Espana and Madrid (both 1962) and the Barcelona and Classic (both 1963). None of these instruments survived the termination of manufacturing of Epiphone instruments in Gibson&#x27;s Kalamazoo plant in 1969, at least in their original form (subsequent Japanese models, some even re-using Kalamazoo-era model names, were of generally cheaper construction, for example using laminated woods and bolt-on necks as compared with their U.S.-made predecessors).

While some of the 1960s, U.S.A. built Epiphones had near-equivalents to models in the Gibson range of the day—for example the Riviera and Casino were very similar to the Gibson ES-335 and ES-330, respectively, the Frontier was somewhat similar to the Gibson Dove, while the Texan, Cortez and Cabellero were generally equivalent to the Gibson J-45, LG-2 and LG-0, respectively—others had no equivalent in the Gibson range, the Sheraton (semi-acoustic thinline version) and Excellente (acoustic) being top-of-the line instruments without any real parallel in the Gibson line/s of the day.

In England in the 1960s, several Epiphone models were brought to particular prominence via their use by The Beatles, Paul McCartney favouring a 1964 Epiphone Texan that he purchased in 1965 and used for the writing of &quot;Yesterday&quot; among other songs, while John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison all performed using Epiphone Casinos through much of the group&#x27;s years of early commercial success.

====Post-Kalamazoo era (1970s-current)====
From the 1970s onwards, production of Epiphone guitars has largely taken place in Japan, Korea and China (refer section &quot;Manufacturing&quot;, below), with a very small number of models also produced in the U.S.A. Since the 2000s, Epiphone branded guitars have fallen broadly into three categories. Firstly, Epiphone is used as a &quot;budget brand&quot; for Gibson, producing identically-named but lower-priced versions of popular Gibson models, such as the Epiphone Les Paul, which serves as a budget model comparable to the Gibson Les Paul. Secondly, Epiphone has also been used to brand models under alternate names, but are otherwise similar to more expensive Gibson-branded guitars, for example the Epiphone G-400 is functionally equivalent to the Gibson SG, and the Epiphone Dot is essentially a budget version of the Gibson ES-335. Thirdly are models which are exclusive to the Epiphone brand without equivalent models produced under the Gibson brand, such as the Epiphone Coronet.

As of January 2021, Epiphone was marketing guitars under several lines, including several categorized on their website as &quot;inspired by Gibson&quot; for models that serve as the budget Gibson version. Historically, hundreds of different models have borne the Epiphone brand, and many are available in the used guitar market.

=== Amplifiers ===

Epiphone began producing amplifiers in 1935 with the Electar Hawaiian Lap Steel Guitar Outfit. This outfit was an amplifier, case and lap steel guitar stand all rolled into one unit and was supplied by a suitcase manufacturer of the time. Electar &quot;Century&quot; and &quot;Zephyr&quot; amplifier models followed.

Gibson produced Epiphone amplifiers in the 1960s. These were copies or variations of Gibson and Fender amplifiers. They used a tube design, and some had reverb and tremolo. Gibson decided to launch a new line of Epiphone tube amplifiers in 2005 with models including the &quot;So Cal,&quot; &quot;Blues Custom,&quot; &quot;Epiphone Valve Junior&quot; and the solid state &quot;Triggerman&quot; range. The &quot;Valve Hot Rod&quot; and &quot;Valve Senior&quot; followed in 2009. The Valve Hot Rod is a 5 watt amp like the Valve Junior, but has a gain and reverb control. The Valve Senior offers 20 watts of power, with a full equalizer, gain, volume, reverb, and presence control.

As of 2012, Epiphone has ceased production of their line of amplifiers with the exception of the Player and Performance Pack practice amplifiers, available only in Epiphone&#x27;s starter packages. These Amplifiers were under the Epiphone Electar brand. In 2014 the 1939 Electar &quot;Century&quot; 18-watt valve amplifier was reissued in an updated 75th anniversary Limited Edition.

==Manufacturing==

===United States===
Epiphone instruments made between 1957 and 1970 were at Gibson facilities on Parsons Street and Eleanor Street in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Solid body guitars with flat tops and backs were made at the Eleanor Street plants (both Gibson and Epiphone). Some of these Epiphone instruments were effectively identical to the relevant Gibson versions, perhaps made with same timber, materials and components as the contemporary equivalent Gibson guitars. Epiphone also continued its production of archtop guitars using the same patterns and molds from Epi&#x27;s New York era.
Some specific examples of Gibson-era Epiphone instruments from this period includes the Epiphone Sheraton (co-developed with the Gibson ES-335 &amp; sharing its semi-hollow body, but with, Epiphone&#x27;s pre-Gibson &quot;Frequensator&quot; tailpiece and &quot;New York&quot; mini-humbucker pickups, and significantly fancier inlays) and Sheraton II (replacing the Frequensator with Gibson&#x27;s &quot;stop-bar&quot; tailpiece), the Epiphone Casino (similar to the Gibson ES-330), the Epiphone Caballero (similar to the Gibson LG-0), the Epiphone Cortez (similar to the Gibson LG-2), the Epiphone Frontier (similar to the Gibson Hummingbird), the Epiphone Olympic Special (similar to the Gibson Melody Maker), the Epiphone Sorrento (similar to the Gibson ES-125TC, except for a few cosmetic changes), and the Epiphone Texan (similar to the Gibson J-45, apart from a change in scale-length). The other Kalamazoo-made Epiphones had technical or cosmetic relationship with the similar Gibson version.

Several Epiphone guitars have been produced in the United States after 1971. The Epiphone Spirit and Special were produced in the early 1980s in Kalamazoo. In 1993, three historic Epiphone acoustic guitars, the Texan, Frontier, and Excellente, were produced by Gibson Acoustic in Montana. The Paul McCartney Texan was produced in 2005, and in 2009, the Epiphone Historic Collection was created, beginning with the 1962 Wilshire, built by Gibson Custom. Several other models, such as the Sheraton and John Lennon Casinos, were built in Japan and assembled and finished by Gibson USA.

===Japan===
In the early 1970s, Matsumoku began to manufacture Epiphone instruments in Japan with the production and distribution being managed by Aria, in cooperation with Gibson. At this time, Epiphone ceased production of all of its traditional designs and began manufacturing markedly less expensive guitars, many of which had less traditional bolt-on style necks and unspecified wood types. Some of these guitars had similar body shapes to traditional Epiphone and Gibson designs but had different names while other models retained certain model designations, such as the FT (Flat Top) guitars. Construction of these guitars differed greatly from past Epiphone models. For the first several years of production in Japan, Epiphone guitars were actually rebranded designs already produced by the Matsumoku Company.

By 1975, the Japanese market started seeing some of the more familiar designs and names being reintroduced. These guitars were of higher quality than that of the previous years of production in Japan and included models such as the Wilshire, Emperor, Riviera and Newport bass. These models were available to the Japanese market only. By 1976 new designs of higher quality were being introduced for export but did not include the current Japanese market models. Notable new designs from this era were the Monticello (Scroll Guitar), the Presentation (PR) and Nova series flat tops and the Genesis solid body guitar. By 1980, most Japanese-only designs were available for worldwide distribution. One in particular, the ES930J, was made at the famed Terada factory and was a superior instrument. The Matsumoku-made archtops, such as the Emperor, Riviera, Sheraton and Casino, were available into the mid-1980s.

===Korea===
From the 1980s, Epiphones were manufactured mainly in South Korea and Japan by contractors licensed by Gibson. One of the contractors was Samick, which also built instruments under license for other brands, and in its own name. The brand was primarily used to issue less expensive versions of classic Gibson models.

The guitars were constructed using different woods, generally only distantly related to true mahogany, and were fastened with epoxies rather than traditional wood glues. Gibson and Epiphone guitars all use Titebond resin glue, which is simple carpenters&#x27; wood glue, and were finished in hard, quick-to-apply polyester resin rather than the traditional nitro-cellulose lacquer used by Gibson Epiphone guitars assembled or made in the US use lacquer finishes unless it&#x27;s a san lacquer (SL for short), but those made outside of the US use a polyurethane finish because of pollution requirements. Those particular budget considerations, along with others such as the use of plastic nuts, and cheaper hardware and pickups, make for a more affordable instrument.

After 1996, Epiphones were built by the Peerless Guitars Co. Ltd., established in 1970 in Busan, South Korea. Many of these Peerless guitars, particularly the 1998 models commemorating their 125th Anniversary, were very well made, represent excellent value, and have become quite collectable. However, all the guitars made at the Peerless plant, including the vastly underrated Sorrento model, are very well made and are well worth a search.

There is a controversial Epiphone guitar using &quot;LU&quot; serial number. It is said those guitars were made in Indonesia under license from Unsung Korea.

===China===
Between the Peerless period and the opening of the Qingdao plant, many Epiphones were constructed at the Zaozhuang Saehan plant in China. Guitars from his period are considered to be of high quality and, because of the relative rareness and quality factors, are sought after by Epiphone fans and collectors.

In 2004, Gibson opened a factory in Qingdao, China, which manufactures Epiphone guitars. With few exceptions, Epiphones are now built only in the Qingdao factory.

Also in 2004, Epiphone introduced a series of acoustic guitars named Masterbilt, after a line of guitars of the 1930s, which are built in the same factory.

===Imperial Series and Elitist===
During the early 1990s, Epiphone released a series called the Imperial Series. These were remakes of the classic Epiphone archtops of the 1930s and &#x27;40s. Each instrument was handmade in the FujiGen factory in Japan. This short-lived series was discontinued in 1993, after only 42 Emperors were made. Several other models, including De Luxe, Broadway and Triumph models, were also produced in varying quantities.

Production was moved back to Nashville and Bozeman for a similar limited run of instruments (250 each of Sheratons, Rivieras, Frontiers, Excellentes and Texans). These guitars were the &quot;Nashville USA Collection&quot; (archtops) and the &quot;Anniversary Series&quot; (acoustics). Contrary to popular information, this line was related to, but not part of the 1994 Gibson Centennial Series commemorating 100 years of the Gibson Guitar Corporation. The Nashville and Anniversary Collections were intended as reintroductions of original, USA built Epiphone models.

In 2002, Epiphone began producing a range of higher quality instruments under the &quot;Elite Series&quot; moniker which were built by Terada and FujiGen in Japan. After legal action by Ovation the name was changed to Elitist in 2003. As of 2008, all of the Elitist models have been discontinued with the exception of the Elitist Casino and the Dwight Trash Casino. The Epiphone Elitist guitars included features such as higher grade woods, bone nuts, hand-rubbed finishes, &quot;Made in the USA&quot; pickups and USA strings. Japanese domestic market Elitists used the Gibson Dove-wing headstock as opposed to the &quot;tombstone&quot; headstock used on exports.

<text>The May 17 Statement, also called the May 17 Declaration, was a statement jointly issued by the Office for Taiwan Affairs under the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on 17 May 2004.

Issued three days before Chen Shui-bian&#x27;s second inaugural, it gave the Taiwanese leadership two choices - &quot;The Taiwan leaders have before them two roads: one is to pull back immediately from their dangerous lurch toward independence, recognizing that both sides of the Taiwan Straits belong to the one and same China and dedicating their efforts to closer cross-Straits relations; the other is play with fire and attempt to cut Taiwan away from China&quot;. Though the language used was considered tough, this declaration broke tradition in that it offered different options, as opposed to the firm edicts issued in the past, and addressed &quot;the issue of international living space of the Taiwan region&quot;, although the insistence on Taiwan&#x27;s recognition of One China Policy still has not loosened.

It was intended to convince that it was in Taiwanese interests to recognize the One China Policy, which President Chen has thus far rejected.

There are seven points in the declaration :
# Resumption of cross-Straits dialogue and negotiations, formal ending of the state of hostility through equal-footed consultations, establishing a mechanism of mutual trust in the military field, and jointly building a framework for peaceful, stable and growing cross-Straits relations.
# Maintaining close links in an appropriate manner between the two sides of the Straits so as to address the problems in cross-Straits relations through timely consultations.
# Realizing comprehensive, direct and two-way &quot;Three Links&quot; so as to facilitate commerce, trade, exchanges, travel, tourism and other activities by compatriots on both sides.
# Establishing closer economic co-operation arrangement on the basis of reciprocity and mutual benefit. Taiwan can acquire greater market access on the mainland for its agricultural products.
# Increasing exchanges between the compatriots on the two sides of the Straits in the interest of removing misunderstanding, enhancing mutual trust and building common ground.
# The Taiwan compatriots can realize their aspirations for cross-Straits peace, social stability and economic prosperity while enjoying harmony and tranquility in cross-Straits ties.
# Properly addressing the issue of international living space of the Taiwan region commensurate with its status so as to share the dignity of the Chinese nation.

Local reporters labelled this statement as CPC General Secretary and Chinese President Hu Jintao&#x27;s &quot;seven points&quot;, as opposed to former general secretary Jiang Zemin&#x27;s declaration of &quot;Jiang&#x27;s eight points&quot;.

<text>The genitofemoral nerve is a mixed branch of the lumbar plexus derived from anterior rami of L1-L2. It splits a genital branch and a femoral branch. It provides sensory innervation to the upper anterior thigh, as well as the skin of the anterior scrotum in males and mons pubis in females. It also provides motor innervation to the cremaster muscle (via its genital branch).

== Structure ==

=== Origin ===
The genitofemoral nerve is a branch of the lumbar plexus. It is derived from the anterior rami of lumbar (spinal) nerves L1-L2. It coalesces within the substances of the psoas major muscle.

=== Course ===
It passes downwards, pierces the psoas major and emerges from its anterior surface. The nerve divides into two branches, the genital branch and the lumboinguinal nerve also known as the femoral branch, both of which then continue downwards and medially to the inguinal and femoral canal respectively.

=== Branches ===

==== Genital branch ====

The genital branch continues downward on the surface of the psoas major muscle, then enters the inguinal canal through the deep inguinal ring.

In men, the genital branch supplies the cremaster and scrotal skin. In women, the genital branch accompanies the round ligament of uterus, terminating in and innervating the skin of the mons pubis and labia majora.

==== Femoral branch ====
The femoral branch passes underneath the inguinal ligament, travelling through the lateral muscular compartment of the femoral sheath where it innervates skin of the upper leg. Passing through the cribriform fascia of the saphenous opening of the fascia lata of the thigh, it then supplies the skin of the upper, anterior and medial side of thigh.

===Variation===

The genitofemoral nerve typically pierces and passes through the psoas major muscle before bifurcating into a genital branch and a femoral branch midway along its anterior surface. In approximately 25% of cases, the genitofemoral nerve splits into these branches &quot;before&quot; it enters the psoas major or &quot;within&quot; the muscle belly of psoas major (with fibers of the psoas major separating the genital and femoral branches). Usually this variation causes the split to be occur earlier in the genitofemoral nerve, at the upper rather than mid-portion of the anterior surface of the psoas major.

===Embryology===

The genitofemoral nerve is formed in the midsection of the psoas muscle by the union of branches from the anterior rami of L1 and L2 nerve roots

==Function==
The genitofemoral nerve is responsible for both the sensory (femoral branch) and motor portions (genital branch) of the cremasteric reflex, which describes contraction of the cremasteric muscle when the skin of the superior medial part of the thigh is touched.

<text>The Indian scops owl (Otus bakkamoena) is a species of owl native to South Asia.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
This species formerly included the collared scops owl (&quot;Otus lettia&quot;). The species epithet is derived from &quot;bakamuna&quot;, the Sinhalese name for the white barn owl &quot;(Tyto alba)&quot;, and the brown fish owl &quot;(Ketupa zeylonensis)&quot;.

==Description==
The Indian scops owl is a small owl, although it is one of the largest of the scops owls. Like other scops owls, it has small head tufts, or &quot;ears&quot;. The upperparts are grey or brown, depending on the morph, with faint buff spotting. The underparts are buff with fine darker streaking. The facial disc is whitish or buff, and the eyes are orange or brown. There is a buff neckband. Sexes are similar. The flight is deeply undulating.

This species is very similar to the slightly larger partially migratory collared scops owl (&quot;Otus lettia&quot;) and the oriental scops owl (&quot;Otus sunia&quot;). They can be separated on call and eye colour.

==Distribution and habitat==
The species occurs from eastern Arabia through the Indian Subcontinent, except the far north.

==Ecology==
The Indian scops owl is nocturnal. Through its natural camouflage, it is very difficult to see in daytime, but may sometimes be located by the small birds that mob it while it is roosting in a tree. It feeds mainly on insects. The call is a soft single note (&quot;whuk?&quot;). It nests in tree holes, laying 3–5 eggs.

<text>The City of Canning is a local government area in the southeastern suburbs of the Western Australian capital city of Perth, about southeast of Perth&#x27;s central business district. The City covers an area of and had a population of approximately 90,000 as at the 2016 Census.

==History==
A short-lived attempt to create a town trust for the Canning District lasted from 1843-1847, before it was dissolved. The area continued to develop under the control of a Central Board of Works until, in 1871, the Canning Road District was established under the &quot;District Roads Act 1871&quot;.

The City of Canning originated as the Municipality of Queen&#x27;s Park, which was established on 1 July 1907 when the original Canning Road District was divided into two and split into the Queen&#x27;s Park municipality and the Gosnells Road District (later to become the City of Gosnells). It was renamed the Queen&#x27;s Park Road District on 5 November 1913.

It was renamed again to become the second Canning Road District on 17 June 1921, and received a large amount of land from the abolished Jandakot Road District on 30 November 1923. On 1 July 1961, Canning Road District became the Shire of Canning under the &quot;Local Government Act 1960&quot;, which reformed all remaining road districts into shires. On 4 December 1970 it gained town status as the Town of Canning and assumed its current name when it gained city status on 10 March 1979.

In 1974 the then-Town of Canning brought heritage registered Woodles Homestead to create a local Heritage museum.

In late 2012, an inquiry against the Canning City Council launched by the State Government&#x27;s Department of Local Government resulted in a 476-page report &quot;pointing to widespread dysfunction, micromanagement and alleged serious governance irregularities.&quot; As a result, the State Government ordered the suspension of the Council, appointing Linton Reynolds to replace it as City Commissioner.

Two years later, in mid-September 2014, it was reported that the State Government had sacked the four remaining Canning councillors, to be replaced by a panel of three new Commissioners upon the end of Commissioner Reynolds&#x27; tenure on 16 September. As part of the Department of Local Governments&#x27; plans, in which the number of local councils would have been reduced drastically, it was announced that the City of Canning would be split up and merged into neighbouring local areas, including the City of Gosnells and City of Melville. Since the failure of the state government&#x27;s council merger process, the governor&#x27;s order for the merger has been revoked.

==Wards==
The city is divided into five wards with each ward electing two councillors while the mayor is directly elected.
* Mason Ward (Bentley, East Cannington, Queens Park, St James and Welshpool)
* Bannister Ward (Riverton, Rossmoyne and Shelley)
* Beeliar Ward (Leeming and Willetton)
* Nicholson Ward (Canning Vale and Parkwood)
* Beeloo Ward (Cannington, Ferndale, Lynwood and Wilson)

<doc id="674668" wikidata="Q3679103" url="?curid=674668" title="Claremont, Western Australia">
<text>Claremont is a western suburb of Perth, Western Australia, on the north bank of the Swan River.

==History==
Prior to European settlement, the Noongar people used the area as a source of water, for fishing and for catching waterfowl.

In 1830, John Butler, a settler, set up an inn at Freshwater Bay (in modern-day Peppermint Grove) to attract travellers on the road from Perth to Fremantle. A wetland became known as Butler&#x27;s Swamp (later Lake Claremont). After the arrival of convicts in the colony in 1850, work began on constructing the Fremantle Road. The government allocated land on the foreshore and at Butler&#x27;s Swamp to 19 Pensioner Guards and their families, and a permanent convict depot operated at Freshwater Bay (until 1875).

A state school (1862) and church were built, and a community grew around what is now Victoria Avenue. A settler named James Morrison acquired a property at Swan Location 702, and named it &quot;Claremont Estate&quot;, after his wife, Clara (née de Burgh). During the 1870s, a number of prominent families, including the Triggs, Sandovers and Stirlings, acquired land in the district, around the later site of Christ Church Grammar School; some of their homes were later bought and used by the school.

In 1881, the railway line from Perth to Fremantle was built, along with a station at Butler&#x27;s Swamp; the name of the station was changed to Claremont in 1883. The focus of the community shifted to the area between the railway line, Fremantle Road (Stirling Highway) and Bay View Terrace. The Freshwater Bay school ceased to play a central role; it became a boarding house nicknamed &quot;’Appy ‘Ome&quot; in 1892 (and in 1975 a museum).

Land speculators bought in the area and subdivided blocks at varying sizes, leading to a wide class diversity within the suburb. By about 1903, the entire suburb, other than a dozen or so streets, had been subdivided, and by the Second World War, the community was firmly established.

==Geography==
Claremont is bounded by Airlie Street to the south; Stirling Highway, Parry Street and Stirling Road to the west; Alfred Road to the north and Loch Street and Bay Road to the east. A large part of Claremont is residential, although a significant shopping area is located along Stirling Highway, and the Claremont Showground and the eastern half of Lake Claremont are within Claremont&#x27;s boundaries.

Claremont has grand homes in the Agett Road and Richardson Avenue areas on the south side of Stirling Highway.

==Population==
At the 2016 census, Claremont had a population of 8,148 people. 61.1% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 8.5%, South Africa 1.9%, China 1.9% and New Zealand 1.7%. 78.3% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin at 2.1%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 32.2%, Anglican 21.3% and Catholic 19.1%.

Of the employed people in Claremont, 6.4% worked in hospitals (excepting psychiatric hospitals). Other major industries of employment included higher education 4.0%, combined primary and secondary education 3.9%, legal services 3.5% and cafes and restaurants 3.3%.

Of occupied private dwellings in Claremont 46.5% were separate houses, 25.3% were semi-detached and 27.5% were flats or apartments.

==Facilities==

Claremont includes the Claremont Showground and the Claremont Oval, home ground of the Claremont Football Club, as well as a significant shopping area along Stirling Highway, most concentrated on the St Quentins Avenue precinct.

Several private schools including Methodist Ladies&#x27; College, Christ Church Grammar School, Presbyterian Ladies&#x27; College, John XXIII College and Scotch College are either in Claremont or within of the suburb boundary. Claremont also contains a small private hospital (Bethesda) and one state primary school; Freshwater Bay Primary School (formed by the amalgamation of Claremont Primary School and East Claremont Primary School), as well as a number of jetties on the Swan River.

The Perth Royal Show, an annual agricultural show, is held at the Claremont Showground. The showground also hosts several large events and music festivals throughout the year.

The suburb contains a number of heritage-listed sites, including the Claremont Post Office and the weatherboard Anzac Cottage.

The Claremont Quarter shopping centre opened in 2009.

==Transport==
Claremont is served by the Claremont railway station and Loch Street railway station at regular times, as well as the Showgrounds railway station during special events. Various buses, including the CircleRoute, travel along Stirling Highway and through Claremont&#x27;s northern and southern sections. All services are operated by the Public Transport Authority.

==Politics==
Claremont is part of the federal division of Curtin. The federal seat is held by the independent Kate Chaney. It was typically regarded as a safe seat for the Liberal Party until the most recent election, as it had been continually retained by the Liberal Party with the exception of former Liberal member Allan Rocher as an independent politician between 1996 and 1998 and the current member Kate Chaney. For the parliament of Western Australia, Claremont is divided between the state electoral districts of Cottesloe and Nedlands, both held by the Liberal Party. The current mayor of Claremont is Jock Barker.

<doc id="674694" wikidata="Q603841" url="?curid=674694" title="Bubastis">
<text>Bubastis (Bohairic Coptic: &quot;Poubasti&quot;; Greek: &quot;Boubastis&quot; or &quot;Boubastos&quot;), also known in Arabic as Tell-Basta or in Egyptian as Per-Bast, was an ancient Egyptian city. Bubastis is often identified with the biblical &quot;Pi-Beseth&quot; ( &quot;py-bst&quot;, Ezekiel 30:17). It was the capital of its own nome, located along the River Nile in the Delta region of Lower Egypt, and notable as a center of worship for the feline goddess Bastet, and therefore the principal depository in Egypt of mummies of cats. 

Its ruins are located in the suburbs of the modern city of Zagazig.

==Etymology==
The name of Bubastis in Egyptian is , conventionally pronounced &quot;Per-Bast&quot; but its Earlier Egyptian pronunciation can be reconstructed as /ˈpaɾu-buˈʀistit/. It is a compound of Egyptian (“house&quot;) and the name of the goddess Bastet; thus the phrase means &quot;House of Bast&quot;. In later forms of Egyptian, sound shifts had altered the pronunciation. In Bohairic Coptic, the name is rendered , or .

==History==

Bubastis served as the capital of the &quot;nome&quot; of &quot;Am-Khent&quot;, the 18th nome of Lower Egypt. Bubastis was situated southwest of Tanis, upon the eastern side of the Pelusiac branch of the Nile. The &quot;nome&quot; and city of Bubastis were allotted to the Calasirian division of the Egyptian war-caste.

=== Second Dynasty ===
In a later account by the Greek historian Manetho, it&#x27;s stated that a &quot;chasm opened near Bubastis and many perished&quot; during the reign of Hotepsekhemwy in the Second Dynasty.

===Twelfth Dynasty===
In the Middle Kingdom, Tell Basta was the site of a large mudbrick palace (16,000 sqm) dated to the Twelfth Dynasty. It has been thought to be a residence of Amenemhat III. A limestone lintel shows the king during his Heb Sed Festival.

===Second Intermediate Period===
Following the Twelfth Dynasty, the Middle Kingdom faded out. At Bubastis, a red granite architrave belonged to Sekhemre Khutawy Khabaw. In another monument found at Tanis, he is mentioned along with Hor.

===Twenty-Second Dynasty===
It became a royal residence after Shoshenq I, the first ruler and founder of the 22nd Dynasty, became pharaoh in 943 BC. Bubastis was its height during this dynasty and the 23rd. It declined after the conquest by Cambyses II in 525 BC, which heralded the end of the Saite 26th Dynasty and the start of the Achaemenid Empire.

The Twenty Second Dynasty of Egyptian monarchs consisted of nine, or, according to Eusebius of three Bubastite kings, and during their reigns the city was one of the most considerable places in the Delta. Immediately to the south of Bubastis were the allotments of land with which Psamtik I rewarded the services of his Ionian and Carian mercenaries; and on the northern side of the city commenced the Canal of the Pharaohs, which Pharaoh Necho II began (but never finished) to go between the Nile and the Red Sea.

=== Persian rule and decline ===

After Bubastis was taken by the Persians, its walls were dismantled. From this period it gradually declined, although it appears in ecclesiastical annals among the episcopal sees of the province Augustamnica Secunda. Bubastite coins of the age of Hadrian exist.
The following is the description which Herodotus gives of Bubastis, as it appeared shortly after the period of the Persian invasion, 525 BC, and Hamilton remarks that the plan of the ruins remarkably warrants the accuracy of this historical eye-witness:
==Religion==

Bubastis was a center of worship for the feline goddess Bastet, sometimes called &quot;Bubastis&quot; after the city, who the Greeks identified with Artemis. The cat was the sacred and peculiar animal of Bast, who is represented with the head of a cat or a lioness and frequently accompanies the deity Ptah in monumental inscriptions. The tombs at Bubastis were accordingly the principal depository in Egypt of the mummies of the cat.

The most distinguished features of the city and nome of Bubastis were its oracle of Bast, the splendid temple of that goddess and the annual procession in honor of her. The oracle gained in popularity and importance after the influx of Greek settlers into the Delta, since the identification of Bast with Artemis attracted to her shrine both native Egyptians and foreigners.

The festival of Bubastis was considered the most joyous and gorgeous of all in the Egyptian calendar as described by Herodotus:
==Christian bishopric==

Extant documents mention the names of three Christian bishops of Bubastis of the 4th and 5th centuries:
* Harpocration, one of the bishops ordained by Melitius of Lycopolis listed in 325
* Hermon, a contemporary of Athanasius of Alexandria, in about 362
* Iulianus at the Second Council of Ephesus in 449

==Excavations==
The tomb of the late New Kingdom vizier Iuty was discovered in December 1964 in the &quot;Cemetery of the Nobles&quot; of Bubastis by the Egyptian archaeologist Shafik Farid.

Since 2008, the German-Egyptian &quot;Tell Basta Project&quot; has been conducting excavations at Bubastis. Previously, in March 2004, a well preserved copy of the Decree of Canopus was discovered in the city.

<text>Sir Anton Dolin (27 July 190425 November 1983) was an English ballet dancer and choreographer.

==Biography==

Dolin was born in Slinfold in Sussex as Sydney Francis Patrick Chippendall Healey-Kay (generally known as Patrick or Pat Kay to his friends). He was the second of three sons of Henry George Kay (1852–1922) and his wife, Helen Maude Chippendall Healey (1869–1960), from Dublin. He trained at Serafina Astafieva&#x27;s school at The Pheasantry in London&#x27;s King&#x27;s Road. In 1921, he joined the Ballets Russes under the guidance of Sergei Diaghilev, the pre-eminent ballet impresario of the time, becoming a principal dancer from 1924. It was Diaghilev who gave Patrick his stage name: Diaghilev &#x27;russified&#x27; names of his star dancers to keep up the tradition of his company.

In the 1930s, Dolin was a principal with the Vic-Wells Ballet. There he danced with Alicia Markova, with whom he went on to found the Markova-Dolin Ballet and the London Festival Ballet. In 1933, he spotted Vera Zorina and introduced her to Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo in 1934.
He joined Ballet Theatre when it was formed in 1940 and remained there as a dancer and choreographer until 1946.

Dolin wrote several books, including: &quot;Divertissement&quot; (1931), the autobiography &quot;Ballet Go Round&quot; (1938) and &quot;Alicia Markova: Her Life and Art&quot; (1953). 
He was knighted in 1981. He is featured in the documentary film &quot;A Portrait of Giselle&quot;.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in April 1978 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at London&#x27;s Royal Academy of Dance.
Upon Dolin&#x27;s death, dancers Jelko Yuresha and Belinda Wright inherited the rights to his choreography of &quot;Giselle&quot;, &quot;Pas de Quatre&quot;, and his acclaimed original ballet, &quot;Variations for Four&quot;. Yuresha and Wright danced—and later staged—productions of these ballets with dance companies around the world, designing original costumes and sets for those performances. In 2017, Yuresha (rights holder) and Philip Ronald Kay (Dolin&#x27;s nephew and heir) founded the Sir Anton Dolin Foundation in Berlin, Germany with the aim of protecting Dolin&#x27;s legacy. Since then, all rights to Dolin&#x27;s works are the property of the Sir Anton Dolin Foundation.

<text>The City of Cockburn ( ) is a local government area in the southern suburbs of the Western Australian capital city of Perth about south of Fremantle and about south of Perth&#x27;s central business district. The City covers an area of and had a population of over 104,000 as at the 2016 Census.

== History ==
Cockburn is named after Cockburn Sound, which was named in 1827 by Captain James Stirling after Admiral Sir George Cockburn. Sir George was born in London in 1772 and was a renowned British naval officer, eventually becoming Admiral of the Fleet and First Sea Lord. He served under Horatio Nelson during the war with France, but came to public attention and was granted his knighthood for his service in the War of 1812, in particular for the burning of Washington in 1814. It was he who took Napoleon to exile on the island of Saint Helena after the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.

In 1871, the Fremantle Road District was created under the &quot;District Roads Act 1871&quot; to cover the area to the south and east of Fremantle, and the Fremantle Road Board was created to manage it. The original District was bounded on the north by the Swan River from Fremantle to the mouth of the Canning River; on the east by a line from Bull Creek to the junction of what is now the intersection of the Albany and South Western Highways in Armadale; on the south by a line from Armadale to, and including the Rockingham townsite; and to the west by the Indian Ocean.

In the first five years of the Board&#x27;s existence most of its members served on the Fremantle Town Council. The function of the Board was simply to provide the roads that linked Fremantle to other parts of the Colony. By 1913 the District was divided into Wards, each electing representatives to the Board. In 1922 the Board constructed new offices at the corner of Forrest and Rockingham Roads.

In July 1923, the District received a large amount of land (gaining the localities of Atwell and Banjup and 75% of the Jandakot locality) from Jandakot Road District when that entity was abolished. On 21 January 1955, it was renamed Cockburn, after a successful referendum underlined the desire for recognition of the District&#x27;s independence from Fremantle.

On 1 July 1961, Cockburn Road District became a shire following the enactment of the &quot;Local Government Act 1960&quot;, and on 24 January 1971, almost exactly 100 years after the formation of the Fremantle Road District, it became a Town in recognition of its increasingly urban nature. On 26 October 1979 the town attained City status.

In May 1966, Rottnest Island and Carnac Island were included in the boundaries of the Shire of Cockburn. However, the council has &quot;no involvement in or responsibility for any functions relating to the control and management of the islands&quot;, which are administered directly by state government agencies.

A public inquiry into corruption in the City of Cockburn was held in 1999. The Council was suspended in April 1999 and dismissed on 30 June 2000, with administrators running the council until an election held on 6 December 2000. In 2007 the City of Cockburn was again embroiled in controversy as alleged evidence of corruption arose at the Corruption and Crime Commission.

== Wards ==
The city is divided into three wards, each electing three councillors. The mayor is directly elected.

<text>Gesine Schwan (née &quot;Schneider&quot;, 22 May 1943) is a German political science professor and member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. The party has nominated her twice as a candidate for the federal presidential elections. On 23 May 2004, she was defeated by the Christian Democrat Horst Köhler. On 23 May 2009, Köhler beat her again to win his second term.

==Personal life==
Born in Berlin on 22 May 1943, Schwan was baptized in the Roman Catholic faith as the daughter of &quot;Oberschulrat&quot; (Senior School Inspector) Hans R. Schneider. During the Third Reich dictatorship her parents were members of the passive resistance, offering protection to a Jewish girl by hiding her. After World War II, the family engaged actively in the reconciliation of Polish–German relations.

In 1969, Schwan married her first husband, Professor Alexander Schwan, with whom she had two children and who died in 1989. In 2004, Gesine Schwan celebrated her second wedding with longtime companion Peter Eigen in Berlin. He is a former World Bank manager as well as a founder and current Chair of the Advisory Council of Transparency International. Schwan is very engaged in German and Polish mutual understanding and therefore supports, in numerous ways, the work of the Freya von Moltke Stiftung for the New Kreisau. She has given numerous presentations on this topic.

==Academic life==

===Education===
In 1962, Schwan graduated (&quot;Abitur&quot;) from the bilingual Französisches Gymnasium, a German-French secondary school in Berlin. In the same year, she began her studies in history, philosophy, romance languages, and political science at the Free University of Berlin and later at University of Freiburg.

===Early career===
After research stays in Warsaw and Kraków, she obtained her Ph.D. in 1970 from FU Berlin for a dissertation on the Polish philosopher Leszek Kołakowski. After that, she became assistant professor at the same university. Here, she continued her works on the critique of Marx for which she received the &quot;habilitation&quot; in 1975.

===Professorship===
Schwan was appointed full professor at the Department of Political Science at FU Berlin in 1977. At the time, her research fields encompassed &quot;political theory, philosophy, psychology, and culture&quot; as well as &quot;theories of democracy and socialism&quot;. In 1980/81, she had a research stay at the Wilson Center for Scholars in the USA; another research stay in 1984 at the Robinson College at Cambridge University; in 1998, she was visiting professor at the New School for Social Research in New York. From 1993 to 1995, she was dean of the Political Science Faculty at FU Berlin.

In 1999, Gesine Schwan competed for the post of president of FU Berlin, but was defeated by Peter Gaehtgens. In the same year, she was elected as the president of Viadrina European University in Frankfurt (Oder).

==Political career==
Schwan belongs to the German tradition of social democratic opposition to Karl Marx&#x27;s theories. In September 1974, she was one of the founding members of the &quot;Seeheimer Kreis&quot;, a conservative think tank within the SPD. She became a member of the SPD &quot;Grundwertekommission&quot; (Commission for Fundamental Values) in 1977. In 1984, she was removed from this position after criticizing the party&#x27;s &quot;Ostpolitik&quot; as cooperating too closely with communist governments, while not engaging enough with dissidents. Rather she sought for support and dialog with those Eastern Europeans who would dare to criticize their governments. Schwan was reinstated in the &quot;Grundwertekommission&quot; in 1996. Since 2002, she has presided over the &quot;German-Polish Forum&quot; together with Janusz Reiter. In November 2004, the German government under Gerhard Schröder appointed her to the newly created office of the co-ordinator for cooperation with Poland (her counterpart on the Polish side was then Irena Lipowicz). She retained this position when the government changed and became headed by Christian Democrat Angela Merkel. In February 2009, she criticized Schröder for being too uncritical towards Vladimir Putin and too insensitive about Polish concerns about closer German-Russian ties.

On 15 September 2010, Schwan supported the new initiative Spinelli Group in the European Parliament, which was founded to reinvigorate the strive for federalisation of the European Union (EU). Other prominent supporters are: Jacques Delors, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, Guy Verhofstadt, Jo Leinen, Andrew Duff, and Elmar Brok.

===Presidential elections===
On 23 May 2004, Schwan was the SPD candidate for the German presidential election. She received 589 votes in the &quot;Bundesversammlung&quot; (Federal Assembly) but was defeated by Horst Köhler who won 604 votes from the 1205 delegates. On 26 May 2008, SPD chairman Kurt Beck announced Schwan&#x27;s renewed nomination for the upcoming presidential elections in 2009. Once again she competed with Horst Köhler, who announced his renewed candidacy on 22 May 2008.
In the event Köhler was re-elected to a second term over Schwan.
===Later political career===
In the 2019 SPD leadership election, Schwan announced her intention to run for the position as the party&#x27;s co-chair, together with Ralf Stegner.

==Other activities==
* Einstein Forum, Member of the Board of Trustees
* CARE Deutschland-Luxemburg, Member of the Board of Trustees
* Museum Berggruen, Member of the International Council
* Theodor Heuss Foundation, Member of the Board of Trustees (since 1994)
* Technische Universität Berlin, Member of the Board of Trustees (2018-2019)

==Controversy==
Ahead of the 2009 presidential election, Schwan was criticized by the Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records, Marianne Birthler, for statements on the political regime of East Germany. Reportedly, several electors from the Green Party refused to vote for Schwan due to her statements regarding the communist state.

<text>The name Kay is found both as a surname and as a given name. In English-speaking countries, it is usually a feminine name, often a short form of Katherine or one of its variants; but it is also used as a first name in its own right, and also as a masculine name (for example in India, the Netherlands, and Sweden). The alternative spelling Kaye is encountered as a surname, but also occasionally as a given name, such as actress Kaye Ballard.

<doc id="674713" wikidata="Q1883079" url="?curid=674713" title="Macula densa">
<text>In the kidney, the macula densa is an area of closely packed specialized cells lining the wall of the distal tubule where it touches the glomerulus. Specifically, the macula densa is found in the terminal portion of the distal straight tubule (thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle), after which the distal convoluted tubule begins.

The cells of the macula densa are sensitive to the concentration of sodium chloride in the thick ascending loop of henle. A decrease in sodium chloride concentration initiates a signal from the macula densa that has two effects: 
(1) it decreases resistance to blood flow in the afferent arterioles, which raises glomerular hydrostatic pressure and helps return the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) toward normal, and
(2) it increases renin release from the juxtaglomerular cells of the afferent and efferent arterioles, which are the major storage sites for renin.

As such, an increase in sodium chloride concentration would result in vasoconstriction of afferent arterioles, and reduced paracrine stimulation of juxtaglomerular cells. This demonstrates the macula densa feedback, where compensatory mechanisms act in order to return GFR to normal.

The release of renin is an essential component of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (&quot;RAAS&quot;), which regulates blood pressure and volume.

==Histology== 
The cells of the macula densa are taller and have more prominent nuclei than surrounding cells of the distal straight tubule (cortical thick ascending limb).

The close proximity and prominence of the nuclei cause this segment of the distal tubule wall to appear darker in microscopic preparations, hence the name &quot;macula densa&quot;.

==Function==
Macula densa cells sense changes in sodium chloride level, and will trigger an autoregulatory response to increase or decrease reabsorption of ions and water to the blood (as needed) in order to alter blood volume and return blood pressure to normal.

A decrease in afferent arteriole diameter causes a decrease in the GFR (glomerular filtration rate), resulting in a decreased concentration of sodium and chloride ions in the filtrate and/or decreased filtrate flow rate. Reduced blood pressure means decreased venous pressure and, hence, a decreased peritubular capillary pressure. This results in a smaller capillary hydrostatic pressure, which causes an increased absorption of sodium ions into the vasa recta at the proximal tubule.

Hence, a decrease in blood pressure results in less sodium chloride present at the distal tubule, where the macula densa is located. The macula densa senses this drop in salt concentration and responds through two mechanisms, both of which are mediated by prostaglandin release. First, prostaglandins preferentially vasodilate the renal afferent arteriole, decreasing afferent arteriole resistance and, thus, offsetting the decrease in glomerular hydrostatic pressure caused by the drop in blood pressure. Second, prostaglandin activates prostaglandin-sensitive specialized smooth muscle cells of the renal afferent arterioles, juxtaglomerular cells (JG cells), to release renin into the bloodstream. The JG cells can also release renin independently of the macula densa. There are stretch-sensitive baroreceptors lining the arterioles that will release renin if a fall in blood pressure (i.e. decreased stretch of arteriole due to less blood flow) in the arterioles is detected. Furthermore, JG cells contain beta-1 adrenergic receptors, and so activation of the sympathetic nervous system will further stimulate renin release.

Thus, a drop in blood pressure results in preferential vasodilation of the afferent arterioles, increasing renal blood flow (RBF), renal plasma flow (RPF) and GFR due to greater blood flow to the glomerulus. Note that there is no change in filtration fraction, as both GFR and RPF are increased. It also results in the release of renin, which, through the renin–angiotensin system, causes constriction of the efferent arterioles, which ultimately increases hydrostatic pressure in the glomerulus.

The process triggered by the macula densa helps keep the GFR fairly steady in response to varying artery pressure.

Damage to the macula densa would impact blood flow to the kidneys because the afferent arterioles would not dilate in response to a decrease in filtrate osmolarity and pressure at the glomerulus would not be increased. As part of the body&#x27;s blood pressure regulation, the macula densa monitors filtrate osmolarity; if it falls too far, the macula densa causes the efferent arterioles of the kidney to contract, thus increasing the pressure at the glomerulus and increasing the glomerular filtration rate.

==Present day==
Historically Cottesloe Beach and its panorama are reflections of the changes in the last 110 years of Perth&#x27;s history. The photos and paintings of Cottesloe Beach that are either in collections or published, give tangible evidence of the importance of beach-oriented activities in the Perth community. Cottesloe Beach is a popular place for beach cricket. An oceanway allows pedestrians and cyclists to move along the beaches.

It is one of Perth&#x27;s most popular beaches and in 2009, &quot;Lonely Planet&quot; named Cottesloe Beach the world&#x27;s 2nd best beach for families.

The Indiana Tea House, which overlooks Cottesloe Beach, is also an icon of the suburb, and in 2021 it was added to the Western Australia Heritage Register.

A new town planning scheme was approved for Cottesloe allowing developers to build to five storeys high along Marine Terrace with the Ocean Beach Hotel site allowed to reach eight storeys. The decision followed a two decade long debate.

A plan to build a skatepark in Cottesloe in 2020, had resulted in heated debate between locals and skateboarders.

==Politics==
From 1901 to 1968 and from 1974 to 1980 Cottesloe was part of the Fremantle electorate, since 1934 a notional Labor seat. Its most prominent member was wartime Prime Minister John Curtin, a Cottesloe resident.

Since 1980, it has been part of the federal division of Curtin. Curtin is regarded as a safe seat for the centre-right Liberal Party, which has held the seat continually since its inception, with the exception of a period from 1995 to 1998 when former Liberal member Allan Rocher held the seat as an independent and since 2022 when the current independent member Kate Chaney was elected. In the parliament of Western Australia, its Legislative Assembly electoral district is Cottesloe, held consecutively by three Liberal Party leaders, currently David Honey.

==Notable residents==
John Curtin, Prime Minister of Australia for much of World War II, was local federal member of parliament from 1928 to 1931 and 1934 to 1945. He lived in Cottesloe from 1918 until his death in office in 1945. Curtin&#x27;s house in Jarrad Street is vested in the National Trust of Australia (WA) and Curtin University. During 2008 there was a suggestion that the house be relocated to the Curtin University grounds but the decision was made that the house remain in Cottesloe. In May 2009 the federal government announced that it would provide a grant of $580,000 to the National Trust to restore the house.

Kathleen Hope Barnes MBE who was a leading Australian nurse was born here in 1909.

Claude de Bernales was a mining entrepreneur who in 1911 bought Attorney-General Richard Pennefather&#x27;s 1898 Federation Queen Anne house, naming it &quot;Overton Lodge&quot;. In 1936 it was rebuilt as a 30-room Inter-war Spanish Mission style residence, designed by Bernard Evans. It was bought for £30,000 by the Town of Cottesloe in 1950 and renamed the &quot;Cottesloe War Memorial Town Hall and Civic Centre&quot;.

Former West Coast Eagles premiership player Chris Mainwaring lived in Cottesloe before his death on 1 October 2007.

<doc id="674734" wikidata="Q1538602" url="?curid=674734" title="City of Gosnells">
<text>The City of Gosnells is a local government area in the southeastern suburbs of the Western Australian capital city of Perth, located northwest of Armadale and about southeast of Perth&#x27;s central business district. The City covers an area of , a portion of which is state forest rising into the Darling Scarp to the east, and had a population of approximately 118,000 at the 2016 Census. The largest activity centre in the City is the Central Maddington shopping centre. District centres exist in the Gosnells town centre and Thornlie.

==History==
The name Gosnells dates back to 1862 when Charles Gosnell who was the owner of London cosmetic company John Gosnell &amp; Co., bought Canning location 16 from the Davis family who were the original grantees in 1829. While the purchase of the land was a personal investment by Charles Gosnell, when the land was sold to developers in 1903 the developers used the association to the well known cosmetic company, claiming it had bought the land because of its fertile soil to grow flowers for the manufacture of its perfume range. The abundance of the Arum Lily (&quot;Zantedeschia aethiopica&quot;) in the area and the marketing by the developers contributed to the myth about the Gosnell company, being so successful that the Gosnells railway station was constructed on the Armadale line in 1903.

The Gosnells Road District was created out of the abolished Canning Road District on 1 July 1907. Industry in the form of brickworks were introduced to Beckenham in the early 1990s. Between 1912 and 1915 fruit fly wiped out nearly all of the stone fruit crops in the region and many farmers turned to dairying and market gardening. Irrigation was vital due to sandy, infertile soils of Canning Vale. In 1923, the City received land from Jandakot Road District when that entity was abolished. Significant development did not occur until the post-war years. The population grew from 7,400 in 1954 to about 11,000 in 1966, and then to 21,000 in 1970. On 1 July 1961, Gosnells Road District became the Shire of Gosnells following enactment of the &quot;Local Government Act 1960&quot;. On 1 July 1973 it gained town status as the Town of Gosnells and assumed its current name when it attained City status on 1 July 1977.

A large industrial estate was first established in Maddington in the 1970s, expanding over the subsequent decades. Commercial and industrial development has also occurred in a linear pattern along Albany Highway between Beckenham and Gosnells.

==Mayors==

The present mayor is Terresa Lynes, who was elected to the position in October 2021, and reelected in 2023.

==Wards==

There are currently no wards within the City of Gosnells with the entire electorate represented by 12 councillors. The mayor is now elected by popular vote from the elected councillors.

Prior to 2011, the city was divided into 3 wards, each of 4 councillors. The mayor was directly elected.
The three wards were:
* Canning Vale Ward
* Bickley Ward
* Gosnells Ward

<doc id="674735" wikidata="Q7672371" url="?curid=674735" title="TV Nation">
<text>TV Nation is a satirical news magazine television series written, co-produced, directed and hosted by Michael Moore that was co-funded and originally broadcast by NBC in the United States and BBC2 in the United Kingdom. The show blended humor and journalism into provocative reports about various issues. After moving to Fox for its second (and final) season, the show won an Emmy Award in 1995 for Outstanding Informational Series.

&quot;TV Nation&quot; was created in the wake of the success Moore had with the documentary &quot;Roger &amp; Me&quot;, prompting Warner Bros. Television to ask Moore for television series ideas. In January 1993, NBC green-lit a pilot episode which took three months to complete. Interest from the BBC prompted NBC to insert the show into its summer 1994 lineup.

== Conception ==
After the success of the 1989 documentary &quot;Roger &amp; Me&quot;, Michael Moore and producer Kathleen Glynn, then a married couple, were approached by Warner Bros. television about creating ideas for a television series. However, Moore was intent on making the full-length film &quot;Canadian Bacon&quot; after writing the script in the summer of 1991. After having his script passed on many times, it was on a visit to Hollywood in November 1992 about the movie that Moore received a phone call in his hotel room from NBC. Without a single TV show idea in mind, Moore agreed to meet with NBC executives about TV show ideas that afternoon. Frantic for ideas, Moore brainstormed over a carphone with producer Glynn on his half-hour drive to Burbank, out of which TV Nation spawned. As Moore and Glynn would later describe it, &quot;TV Nation&quot; &quot;would be a humorous magazine show but with one distinct difference—it would have a point of view.&quot; Expecting the concept to be quickly dismissed by NBC executives during the meeting, Moore proceeded to describe the show in the most ludicrous ways possible, saying, &quot;it would be a cross between &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and Fidel Castro on laughing gas.&quot; Instead of quickly dismissing Moore&#x27;s pitch, the NBC executives (including Warren Littlefield) were laughing. When Moore returned to his hotel, a message had already been left for him saying that production of a pilot episode had the go-ahead.

Production on the pilot episode of &quot;TV Nation&quot; began in January 1993. Moore initially turned to friends and colleagues in many production areas, while also making a point of ensuring the show&#x27;s employees were unionized. For the show&#x27;s title sequence, graphic designer Chris Harvey put together the images, and music group tomandandy wrote the &quot;TV Nation&quot; theme. After completing the pilot in three months, both NBC executives and focus groups were highly impressed with the show. But without room in their fall 1993 schedule, NBC indefinitely delayed committing to a full season. That winter, the head of BBC2 heard about the pilot, and after watching it offered to buy the show. With firm interest in the show, NBC offered to put &quot;TV Nation&quot; into its summer 1994 lineup.

==Episodes and format==

Season one was originally broadcast in the United States on NBC in the summer of 1994, with the premiere airing July 19, 1994. After NBC canceled the show after one season, it was subsequently picked up by Fox, and the second season aired in the summer of 1995.

&quot;TV Nation&quot; was formatted as a newsmagazine, with stories interspersed by short clips of the show&#x27;s theme (for example, Moore spending a day with Dr. Jack Kevorkian) and factual polls surveying the American public. The show&#x27;s investigative reports delved into various aspects of American life, and they were filmed and presented in a style similar to Moore&#x27;s feature-length documentaries such as &quot;The Big One&quot; (1998).

The show featured segments such as &quot;The Corporate Challenge,&quot; in which CEOs were challenged to prove they could use the products their companies created; the storming of the supposedly &quot;private&quot; beach in Greenwich, Connecticut; hiring ex-KGB officer Yuri Shvets to conduct investigations; an experiment to see if hiring a lobbyist for $5,000 could get the Congress to declare a &quot;TV Nation Day&quot; (he got a bill introduced, but it never passed); and &quot;Crackers the Corporate Crime Fighting Chicken.&quot; Among its correspondents were Merrill Markoe, Janeane Garofalo, Karen Duffy, Jonathan Katz, Rusty Cundieff and Louis Theroux. Crackers was first portrayed by Lee Brownstein, but &quot;TV Nation&quot; writer John Derevlany played Crackers for the remainder of the show&#x27;s run. &quot;TV Nation&quot; also featured humorous (but true) public opinion polls, each conducted by the firm of Widgery and Associates from a random sample of Americans.

===Unaired segments===
The release of &quot;TV Nation&quot; on two VHS volumes in 1997 offered a chance to view two unaired segments considered too controversial to be aired on broadcast television at the time. In the first segment at the end of Volume One, one of the correspondents visits drug stores and inquires about extra-small sized condoms. The second unaired segment at the end of Volume Two looks at the Phelps family, known for picketing the funerals of AIDS victims.
Three additional segments were not allowed to air on American television, although all aired in United Kingdom: A segment on a support group formed for executives involved in the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s; an examination of the extreme anti-abortion movement; and re-enacting the 1992 Los Angeles riots using Civil War re-enactors.

==Awards and recognition==

&quot;TV Nation&quot; won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Informational Series on September 8, 1995, and was later named number 90 on the list of the British Film Institute&#x27;s 100 Greatest British Television Programmes. During its original broadcast run, &quot;TV Nation&quot; working with the well known Washington lobbyist William C. Chasey was recognized by the United States Congress in resolution H.J. 365, which declared August 16, 1994 as &quot;TV Nation Day.&quot; The bill was introduced by Rep. Howard Coble, R, North Carolina, co-sponsored by Rep. Floyd H. Flake D, New York. &quot;TV Guide&quot; named &quot;TV Nation&quot; one of the ten best television shows of 1995.

==Cancellation and post-&quot;TV Nation&quot;==
In December 1995, the Fox network decided not to pick up its option for more episodes of the show, despite receiving more letters and mail than they ever had for any show. By January 1997, the BBC had raised all of the necessary money for an eight-episode-long third season of &quot;TV Nation&quot;, receiving funds from TV networks in five different countries (Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and France). What prevented the third season from becoming a reality was a lack of a major American television network outlet for the show. During this time reruns of the show began appearing on Comedy Central, and ratings for the first week were, in Moore&#x27;s words, &quot;incredible.&quot;

After &quot;TV Nation&quot; ended, two VHS volumes of the show were released in 1997. &quot;Adventures in a TV Nation&quot;, a book about the series written by Moore and Glynn, was published in 1998. The funding previously acquired from British broadcaster Channel 4 for a third season eventually turned into the new TV series &quot;The Awful Truth&quot;. It was broadcast on the Bravo cable television network in the US from 1999 to 2000. There are currently no known reruns of &quot;TV Nation&quot; being shown by a United States TV station or cable channel, nor are there any plans to release it on DVD or to online video sites like Hulu.com.

==Home video releases==
Two VHS video cassettes were released in 1997 by Columbia TriStar Home Video.

==Reboot==
In 2019, TBS cancelled plans to reboot &quot;TV Nation&quot;. The series was originally greenlighted in 2017 with the title &quot;Live from the Apocalypse&quot; and developed for TNT.

<text>The second USS &quot;Florida&quot; was a sidewheel steamer in the United States Navy.

&quot;Florida&quot; was purchased and commissioned on 5 October 1861, with Lieutenant John R. Goldsborough in command.

&quot;Florida&quot; stood out of New York Harbor on 19 October 1861 to join the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron in patrolling the coasts of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. She helped capture a ship and a schooner who were running the blockade. Returning to New York during November 1862, she was decommissioned for repairs, and was recommissioned 7 March 1863 for service with the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. She was particularly successful in this assignment, capturing a steamer and a schooner off Wilmington, North Carolina, in June 1863, and aiding the destruction of a number of British steamers used as blockade runners in February 1864, including PS &quot;Fanny and Jennie&quot;.

Again out of commission for repairs between 12 December 1864 and 26 February 1865, &quot;Florida&quot; sailed 10 March with supplies for ships on station along the Atlantic coast. She proceeded through the Gulf of Mexico to New Orleans where she embarked Confederate prisoners from the ram CSS &quot;Webb&quot;, transporting them to New York. &quot;Florida&quot; weighed anchor again to cruise the Gulf of Mexico until the end of 1865.

On her final voyage, &quot;Florida&quot; sailed in the West Indies from 4 January 1866 to 8 April 1867. She was placed out of commission for the last time on 26 April 1867 and subsequently sold.

<doc id="674742" wikidata="Q1282413" url="?curid=674742" title="Stanley Spencer">
<text>Sir Stanley Spencer, CBE RA (30 June 1891 – 14 December 1959) was an English painter. Shortly after leaving the Slade School of Art, Spencer became well known for his paintings depicting Biblical scenes occurring as if in Cookham, the small village beside the River Thames where he was born and spent much of his life. Spencer referred to Cookham as &quot;a village in Heaven&quot; and in his biblical scenes, fellow-villagers are shown as their Gospel counterparts. Spencer was skilled at organising multi-figure compositions such as in his large paintings for the Sandham Memorial Chapel and the &quot;Shipbuilding on the Clyde&quot; series, the former being a First World War memorial while the latter was a commission for the War Artists&#x27; Advisory Committee during the Second World War.

As his career progressed Spencer often produced landscapes for commercial necessity and the intensity of his early visionary years diminished somewhat while elements of eccentricity came more to the fore. Although his compositions became more claustrophobic and his use of colour less vivid he maintained an attention to detail in his paintings akin to that of the Pre-Raphaelites. Spencer&#x27;s works often express his fervent if unconventional Christian faith. This is especially evident in the scenes that he based in Cookham which show the compassion that he felt for his fellow residents and also his romantic and sexual obsessions. Spencer&#x27;s works originally provoked great shock and controversy. Nowadays, they still seem stylistic and experimental, while the nude works depicting his futile relationship with his second wife, Patricia Preece, such as the &quot;Leg of mutton nude&quot;, foreshadow some of the much later works of Lucian Freud. Spencer&#x27;s early work is regarded as a synthesis of French Post-Impressionism, exemplified for instance by Paul Gauguin, plus early Italian painting typified by Giotto. In later life Spencer remained an independent artist and did not join any of the artistic movements of the period, although he did show three works at the &quot;Second Post-Impressionist Exhibition&quot; in 1912.

==Early life==

Stanley Spencer was born in Cookham, Berkshire, the eighth surviving child of William and Anna Caroline Spencer (née Slack). His father, usually known as Par, was a music teacher and church organist. Stanley&#x27;s younger brother, Gilbert Spencer (1892–1979), also became a notable artist, known principally for his landscape paintings. The family home, &quot;Fernlea&quot;, on Cookham High Street, had been built by Spencer&#x27;s grandfather Julius Spencer. Stanley Spencer was educated at home by his sisters Annie and Florence, as his parents had reservations about the local council school but could not afford private education for him. However, Gilbert and Stanley took drawing lessons from a local artist, Dorothy Bailey. Eventually, Gilbert was sent to a school in Maidenhead, but the family did not feel this would be beneficial for Stanley, who was developing into a solitary teenager given to long walks, yet with a passion for drawing. Par Spencer approached local landowners, Lord and Lady Boston, for advice, and Lady Boston agreed Stanley could spend time drawing with her each week. In 1907 Lady Boston arranged for Stanley to attend Maidenhead Technical Institute, where his father insisted he should not take any exams.

From 1908 to 1912, Spencer studied at the Slade School of Fine Art in London, under Henry Tonks. His contemporaries at the Slade included Dora Carrington, Maxwell Gordon Lightfoot, Mark Gertler, Paul Nash, Edward Wadsworth, Isaac Rosenberg and David Bomberg. So profound was his attachment to Cookham that most days he would take the train back home in time for tea. It even became his nickname: his fellow student C. R. W. Nevinson dubbed him &quot;Cookham&quot;, a name which Spencer himself took to using for a time. While at the Slade, Spencer allied with a short-lived group who called themselves the &quot;Neo-Primitives&quot; which was centred on Bomberg and William Roberts.

In 1912 Spencer exhibited the painting &quot;John Donne Arriving in Heaven&quot; and some drawings in the British section of the &quot;Second Post-Impressionist Exhibition&quot; organised by Roger Fry in London. The same year he painted &quot;The Nativity&quot;. for which he won a Slade Composition Prize and he also began painting &quot;Apple Gatherers&quot;, which was shown in the first Contemporary Art Society exhibition the following year. In 1914 Spencer completed &quot;Zacharias and Elizabeth&quot; and &quot;The Centurion&#x27;s Servant&quot;. The latter painting featured not only Spencer himself as the servant, but also his brothers and the bed from his own nursery. He also began work on a self-portrait. &quot;Self-portrait&quot; (1914) was painted in Wisteria Cottage, a decaying Georgian house Spencer rented, from the local coalman in Cookham, for use as a studio. Painted with a mirror, the painting is bold and austere with a direct and penetrating gaze, softened by the deep shadow on the right hand side – the head fills the picture space and is painted one and a half times life size. &quot;Apple Gatherers&quot; had been bought by the artist Henry Lamb, who promptly sold it to the art collector Edward Marsh. Marsh later bought &quot;Self-portrait&quot; and considered it to be &quot;masterly...glowing with genius.&quot;

==First World War==

At the start of the First World War Spencer was keen to enlist but his mother persuaded him, given his poor physique, to apply for ambulance duties. In 1915 Spencer volunteered to serve with the Royal Army Medical Corps, RAMC, and worked as an orderly at the Beaufort War Hospital, Bristol, a large Victorian gothic building that had been a lunatic asylum. After thirteen months at Beaufort, the RAMC transferred Spencer to overseas duties. He left Beaufort in May 1916 and after ten weeks&#x27; training at Tweseldown Camp in Hampshire, the 24-year-old Spencer was sent to Macedonia, with the 68th Field Ambulance unit. In 1917 he subsequently volunteered to be transferred to an infantry unit, the 7th Battalion, the Berkshire Regiment. In all, Spencer spent two and a half years on the front line in Macedonia, facing both German and Bulgarian troops, before he was invalided out of the Army following persistent bouts of malaria. His survival of the war that killed so many of his fellows, including his elder brother Sydney, who died in action in September 1918, indelibly marked Spencer&#x27;s attitude to life and death. Such preoccupations came through time and again in his subsequent works.

Spencer returned to England at the end of 1918 and went back to his parents at Fernlea in Cookham, where he completed &quot;Swan Upping&quot;, the painting he had left unfinished when he enlisted. &quot;Swan Upping&quot; was first exhibited at the New English Art Club in 1920 and was bought by J. L. Behrend. Spencer had begun the painting by making a small oil study and several drawings from memory before visiting Turks Boatyard beside Cookham Bridge to confirm his composition. Spencer worked systematically from top to bottom on the canvas but had only completed the top two-thirds of the picture when he had to leave it in 1915. Returning to the work Spencer found it difficult to continue after his war-time experiences, often stating &quot;It is not proper or sensible to expect to paint after such experience.&quot;

===&quot;Travoys Arriving with Wounded ...&quot;===

In 1919 Spencer was commissioned by the British War Memorials Committee of the Ministry of Information to paint a large work for a proposed, but never built, Hall of Remembrance. The resulting painting, &quot;Travoys Arriving with Wounded at a Dressing Station at Smol, Macedonia, September 1916&quot;, now in the Imperial War Museum, was clearly the consequence of Spencer&#x27;s experience in the medical corps. He wrote, &quot;About the middle of September 1916 the 22nd Division made an attack on Machine Gun Hill on the Doiran Vardar Sector and held it for a few nights. During these nights the wounded passed through the dressing stations in a never-ending stream.&quot; Among the dressing stations was an old Greek church which Spencer drew such that, with the animal and human onlookers surrounding it, it would recall depictions of the birth of Christ, but to Spencer the wounded figures on the stretchers spoke of Christ on the Cross while the lifesaving work of the surgeons represented the Resurrection. He wrote, &quot;I meant it not a scene of horror but a scene of redemption.&quot; And also, &quot;One would have thought that the scene was a sordid one...but I felt there was grandeur...all those wounded men were calm and at peace with everything, so the pain seemed a small thing with them.&quot;

==1920–1927==
Spencer lived in Cookham until April 1920 when he moved to Bourne End to stay with the trade union lawyer Henry Slesser and his wife. While there, he worked on a series of paintings for their private oratory. In all, during the year he spent at the Slessor&#x27;s home, Spencer painted some twenty pictures including &quot;Christ Carrying the Cross&quot;, which is now in the Tate. In 1921 Spencer stayed with Muirhead Bone at Steep in Hampshire where he worked on mural designs for a village hall war memorial scheme which was never completed. In 1923 Spencer spent the summer in Poole, Dorset, with Henry Lamb. While there he worked on sketch designs for another possible war memorial scheme. These designs convinced two early patrons of Spencer&#x27;s work, Louis and Mary Behrend, to commission a group of paintings as a memorial to Mary&#x27;s brother, Lieutenant Henry Willoughby Sandham, who had died in the war. The Behrends planned to build a chapel in the village of Burghclere in Berkshire to house the paintings.
In October 1923, Spencer started renting Henry Lamb&#x27;s studio in Hampstead where he began work on &quot;The Resurrection, Cookham&quot;. In 1925, Spencer married Hilda Carline, a former student at the Slade and the sister of the artists Richard and Sydney Carline. The couple first met in 1919 and had originally announced their engagement in 1922 after a Carline family painting trip to Yugoslavia. Spencer repeatedly cancelled, or otherwise postponed, their wedding until 1925. A daughter, Shirin, was born in November of that year and a second daughter, Unity, in 1930.

=== &quot;The Resurrection, Cookham&quot; ===

In February 1927 Spencer held his first one-man exhibition at the Goupil Gallery. The centre piece of the exhibition was &quot;The Resurrection, Cookham&quot; which received rave reviews in the British press. &quot;The Times&quot;″ art critic described it as &quot;the most important picture painted by any English artist in the present century. ... What makes it so astonishing is the combination in it of careful detail with the modern freedom of form. It is as if a Pre-Raphaelite had shaken hands with a Cubist.&quot;

The huge painting is set in the grounds of the Holy Trinity Church, Cookham, and shows Spencer&#x27;s friends and family from Cookham and Hampstead, and others emerging from graves watched by figures of God, Christ and the saints. To the left of the church some of the resurrected are climbing over a stile, others are making their way to the river to board a Thames pleasure boat, others are simply inspecting their headstones. Spencer created the picture in the early years of his marriage to Hilda and she appears three times in the picture. Overall, the Goupil exhibition was a great success with thirty-nine of the displayed paintings being sold. &quot;The Resurrection, Cookham&quot; was purchased by Lord Duveen, who presented it to the Tate. After the exhibition Spencer moved to Burghclere to begin work on the Sandham Memorial Chapel for the Behrends.

==Burghclere, 1927–1932==

The Sandham Memorial Chapel in Burghclere was a colossal undertaking. Spencer&#x27;s paintings cover a twenty-one foot high, seventeen-and-half foot wide end wall, eight seven foot high lunettes, each above a predella, with two twenty-eight feet long irregularly shaped strips between the lunettes and the ceiling. The Behrends were exceptionally generous patrons and not only paid for the chapel to be built to Spencer&#x27;s specifications but also paid the rent on the London studio where he completed &quot;The Resurrection, Cookham&quot; and built a house for him and Hilda to live in nearby while working at Burghclere, as Spencer would be painting the canvases &quot;in situ&quot;. The chapel was designed to Spencer&#x27;s specifications by the architect Lionel Pearson and was modelled on Giotto&#x27;s Arena Chapel in Padua.

The sixteen paintings in the chapel are double hung on opposite walls akin to the progression of altarpieces in a Renaissance church nave. The series begins with a lunette depicting shell-shocked troops arriving at the gates of Beaufort, continues with a scene of kit inspection at the RAMC Training Depot in Hampshire which is followed by scenes of Macedonia. Spencer did not depict heroism and sacrifice, but rather in panels such as &quot;Scrubbing the Floor&quot;, &quot;Bedmaking&quot;, &quot;Filling Tea Urns&quot; and &quot;Sorting and Moving Kit Bags&quot;, the unremarkable everyday facts of daily life in camp or hospital and a sense of human companionship rarely found in civilian life as he remembered events from Beaufort, Macedonia and Tweseldown Camp. Such is the absence of violence in the panels, &quot;The Dugout&quot; panel was based on Spencer&#x27;s thought of &quot;how marvellous it would be if one morning, when we came out of our dug-outs, we found that somehow everything was peace and the war was no more.&quot; The scene, &quot;Map Reading&quot; offers a contrast to the dark earth of the hospital and military camps in the other panels and shows a company of soldiers resting by a roadside paying little attention to the only officer depicted among the hundreds of figures Spencer painted for the chapel. Bilberry bushes fill the background of the painting, making the scene appear green and Arcadian which seems to prefigure the paradise promised in the &quot;Resurrection of the Soldiers&quot; on the end, altar, wall. Spencer imagined the &quot;Resurrection of the Soldiers&quot; taking place outside the walled village of Kalinova in Macedonia with soldiers rising out of their graves and handing in identical white crosses to a Christ figure towards the top of the wall. Working on the Memorial Chapel has been described as a six-year process of remembrance and exorcism for Spencer and he explained the emphasis on the colossal resurrection scene, &quot;I had buried so many people and saw so many bodies that I felt death could not be the end of everything.&quot;

While working at Burghclere, Spencer also undertook other small commissions including a series of five paintings, on the theme of &quot;Industry and Peace&quot;, for the Empire Marketing Board in 1929, which were not used, and a series of 24 pen-and-ink sketches for a 1927 Almanack. Much later in his life Spencer adapted seven of these sketches into paintings including &quot;The Dustbin, Cookham&quot; painted in 1958.

==Cookham, 1932–1935==
By 1932 Spencer was back in Cookham with his two daughters and Hilda living in a large house, Lindworth, off the High Street. Here Spencer painted observational studies of his surroundings and other landscapes, which would become the major themes of his work over the following years. During 1932 he was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy and exhibited ten works at the Venice Biennale. However he was becoming dissatisfied with married life. Hilda was often in Hampstead as her elder brother was badly ill and when she was in Cookham life with her was not the cosy domestic idyll Spencer expected. In 1929 Spencer had met the artist Patricia Preece, and he soon became infatuated with her. Preece was a young fashion-conscious artist who had lived in Cookham since 1927 with her lesbian partner, the artist Dorothy Hepworth. In 1933 she first modelled for Spencer and when he visited Switzerland that summer, to paint landscapes, Preece joined him there.

===&quot;The Church-House project&quot;===
During the First World War Spencer had begun to conceive of a chapel of peace and love in which to display his works and these ideas developed further while working at Burghclere. Eventually he developed a complete scheme of domestic and religious spaces mixing his love of Cookham with cycles of paintings illustrating sacred and profane love. The original lay-out of the Church-House would have mirrored the geography of Cookham with the nave based on the High Street, while School Lane and the path beside the Thames would be the aisles. In one version, Spencer envisaged the building would include bedrooms as chapels, fireplaces as altars and decorated bathrooms and lavatories while other versions of the scheme were more like an English parish church. As well as a chapel dedicated to Hilda, there would be a chapel dedicated to Elise Munday, the Spencer family servant, and the subject of Hilda&#x27;s finest painting. Spencer had at least two significant affairs during his life, one with Daphne Charlton while at Leonard Stanley, and the other with Charlotte Murray, a Jungian analyst, when he was working in Port Glasgow, and there were to be chapels dedicated to both of them. Although the structure was never built, Spencer continually returned to the project throughout his life and continued to paint works for the building long after it had become clear it would never be constructed. His original scheme included three sequences of paintings, two of which &quot;The Marriage of Cana&quot; and &quot;The Baptism of Christ&quot; were completed. &quot;The Turkish Windows&quot;,(1934), and &quot;Love Among the Nations&quot;,(1935), were designed as long friezes for the nave of the Church-House.

Numerous other paintings were intended for the Church-House. These included the two paintings Spencer submitted for the 1935 Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, &quot;Saint Francis and the Birds&quot; and &quot;The Dustman&quot; or &quot;The Lovers&quot;. The Royal Academy rejected both pictures, and Spencer resigned from the Academy in protest. The rejection of the Saint Francis picture was particularly galling for Spencer as the model for the figure of Saint Francis had been his own father, wearing his own dressing gown and slippers, which Spencer had intended to hang in the nave of the Church-House.

==Divorce and remarriage, 1935–1938==
Spencer made a return visit to Switzerland in 1935, and Patricia Preece travelled with him. When they returned to Cookham, Spencer&#x27;s wife, Hilda, moved to Hampstead, and his contact with his daughters became limited. Hilda was growing increasingly despondent and hurt at Spencer&#x27;s fixation with Preece. She sent their older daughter Shirin to live with a relative. Shirin later commented: &quot;When I was young I just thought this is how things were. But as I got older, and realised what Patricia had done, she became the one person I really hated.&quot; Preece began to manage Spencer&#x27;s finances and he later signed the deeds of his house, Lindworth, over to her. Between the middle of 1935 and 1936 Spencer painted a series of nine pictures, known as the &quot;Domestic Scenes&quot; in which he recalled, or re-imagined, life with Hilda at home. While Spencer was painting these, Hilda, as shown by her letters from the time, finally started divorce proceedings and a &quot;decree absolute&quot; was issued in May 1937.
A week later Spencer married Preece; she, however, continued to live with Hepworth, and refused to consummate the marriage. When Spencer&#x27;s bizarre relationship with Preece finally fell apart, she refused to grant him a divorce. Spencer would often visit Hilda, and he continued to do so throughout her subsequent mental breakdown and until her death from cancer in November 1950. The painful intricacies of this three-way relationship became the subject in 1996 of a play, &quot;Stanley&quot; by the feminist playwright Pam Gems.

Spencer painted naked portraits of Preece in 1935 and 1936 and, also in 1936, a double nude portrait of himself and Preece, &quot;Self-Portrait with Patricia Preece&quot;, now in the Fitzwilliam Museum. This was followed, in 1937, by &quot;Double Nude Portrait: The Artist and His Second Wife&quot;, known as the &quot;Leg of mutton nude&quot;, a painting never publicly exhibited during Spencer&#x27;s lifetime. In a futile attempt to be reconciled with Hilda, Spencer went to stay with her in Hampstead for ten days. Her rejection of this approach is the basis of &quot;Hilda, Unity and Dolls&quot;, which Spencer painted during that visit. During the winter of 1937, alone in Southwold, Suffolk, Spencer begin a series of paintings, &quot;The Beatitudes of Love&quot;, about ill-matched couples. These pictures, and others of often radical sexual imagery, were intended for cubicles in the Church-House where the visitor could &quot;meditate on the sanctity and beauty of sex&quot;. When Sir Edward Marsh, Spencer&#x27;s early patron, was shown these paintings his response was &quot;Terrible, terrible Stanley!&quot;

In October 1938 Spencer had to leave Cookham and moved to London, spending six weeks with John Rothenstein before moving to a bedsit in Swiss Cottage. There was now no realistic hope of reconciliation with Hilda and he was already distanced from Preece, who had rented out Lindworth so effectively evicting Spencer. At this low point Spencer painted four of the canvases in the &quot;Christ in the Wilderness&quot; series. He originally intended to paint a series of 40, one representing each day of Jesus&#x27;s sojourn in the wilderness, but in the end only eight were completed and a ninth was left unfinished. By September 1939, he was staying at Leonard Stanley in Gloucestershire with the artists George and Daphne Charlton. Spencer created many important works in his room above the bar of the White Hart Inn which he used as a studio, including &quot;Us in Gloucestershire&quot; and &quot;The Wool Shop&quot;. While in Gloucestershire, Spencer also began a series of over 100 pencil works, now known as the &quot;Scrapbook Drawings&quot;, which he continued to add to for at least ten years.

==Port Glasgow, 1939–1945==
Since late in 1938, Spencer&#x27;s agent, Dudley Tooth had been managing Spencer&#x27;s finances and when the Second World War broke out he wrote to E.M.O&#x27;R. Dickey, the secretary of the War Artists&#x27; Advisory Committee, WAAC, seeking employment for Spencer. In May 1940 WAAC sent Spencer to the Lithgows Shipyard in Port Glasgow on the River Clyde to depict the civilians at work there. Spencer became fascinated by what he saw and sent WAAC proposals for a scheme involving up to sixty-four canvases displayed on all four sides of a room. 

WAAC agreed to a more modest series of up to eleven canvases, some of which would be up to six metres long. The first two of these, &quot;Burners&quot; and &quot;Caulkers&quot; were completed by the end of August 1940. WAAC purchased the three parts of &quot;Burners&quot;, but not &quot;Caulkers&quot;, for £300 and requested a further painting, &quot;Welders&quot;, for balance. Spencer delivered &quot;Welders&quot; in March 1941 and in May 1941 saw the two paintings hanging together for the first time at the WAAC exhibition in the National Gallery. WAAC held Spencer in the highest regard, and in particular Dickey ensured he received, almost, all the expenses and materials he requested and even accepted his refusal to fill in any forms or sign a contract.

Between trips to Port Glasgow, Spencer was renting a room in Epsom, to be near Hilda and his children, but the landlady there disliked him and he wanted to move back to Cookham and work on the paintings in his old studio but he could not afford to rent it from Preece, so WAAC agreed further financial help for that purpose. In May 1942, Spencer delivered &quot;Template&quot;, followed by twelve portraits of Clydesiders in October 1942. 

By June 1943, Spencer was having problems with the composition of the next painting in the series, &quot;Bending the Keel plate&quot; and considered abandoning it. Although he was not entirely happy with the painting, WAAC purchased it in October 1943 for 150 guineas. About this time, the owner of the shipyard, James Lithgow, complained to WAAC about Spencer&#x27;s portrayal of his shipyard. WAAC duly commissioned Henry Rushbury to go to Port Glasgow and produce some rather more conventional views of shipbuilding for Lithgow. Spencer made further visits to Glasgow and by June 1944 had completed &quot;Riggers&quot; and begun work on &quot;Plumbers&quot;. After WAAC had purchased these two paintings, they did not have enough funds to authorise the completion of the entire original scheme of paintings. By the time WAAC was wound up, money had been made available for one further picture, &quot;The Furnaces&quot;, which would become the central piece of the scheme. After the war, when the WAAC collection of artworks was dispersed to different museums, the complete &quot;Shipbuilding on the Clyde&quot; series was offered to the National Maritime Museum who refused to accept the pictures and they were given to the Imperial War Museum instead.

In November 2006, the Imperial War Museum asked Sir Alex Ferguson, whose father, brother and an uncle were working in the yards while Spencer was there, to lead a campaign to fund restoration of Spencer&#x27;s paintings of the Port Glasgow&#x27;s shipyards.

The Riverside Museum, Glasgow, now displays Spencer&#x27;s shipyard paintings as a biannual rotation of works on loan from the Imperial War Museum. 

In 1982, Robert Wyatt used sections from two of the panels on sleeve art for his single &quot;Shipbuilding&quot;.

In 2014 on the site of the former Kingston Shipyard in Port Glasgow, which is now a retail park, a memorial in plate steel was erected to Spencer.

In 1945 Spencer returned to live in Cookham in a house called Cliveden View, which had once belonged to his brother Percy.

==Resurrection pictures, 1945–1950==
While the Resurrection had long been a recurring theme in Spencer&#x27;s work, in the years after the war it became especially so. Writing in his notebooks, Spencer attributed this to a revelation he had while in Port Glasgow working on the &quot;Shipbuilding on the Clyde&quot; series,
One evening in Port Glasgow when unable to write due to a jazz band playing in the drawing-room just below me, I walked up along the road past the gas works to where I saw a cemetery on a gently rising slope... I seemed then to see that it rose in the midst of a great plain and that all in the plain were resurrecting and moving towards it... I knew then that the resurrection would be directed from this hill.

Later he wrote,I have read somewhere (might be Donne or Bunyan or Blake) that the resurrection is a kind of climbing of the Hill of Zion. I want to express this climbing idea... the hill will be illumined from the right, casting a long shadow across the plain far into the left side of the picture... Those resurrecting away in the plain on the left shadow-side of the hill must come round in front of the hill to join those coming from the right sunlit side, so there must be ground to walk on in front of the hill.

Spencer&#x27;s original plan for realising this vision would have required a canvas some fifty feet wide. Appreciating that this was impractical, he instead embarked on a series of paintings of various sizes. The two largest of these, &quot;Resurrection: The Hill of Sion&quot; and &quot;Resurrection: Port Glasgow&quot;, at some twenty-two feet long each, matched the scale of his original vision. These were supplemented by a series of triptychs, &quot;Reunion&quot;, &quot;Rejoicing&quot;, &quot;Waking Up&quot; and &quot;The Raising of Jairus&#x27; Daughter&quot; plus two smaller pieces. A number of additional panels for some of the triptychs were planned but never completed. Spencer wanted the entire series displayed together, but each piece was sold to a different collector or gallery. &quot;Resurrection: Port Glasgow&quot; was exhibited with the &quot;Shipbuilding on the Clyde&quot; series for the first time in 2000 to great acclaim.

==Final years==

In 1950, the outgoing president of the Royal Academy, Sir Alfred Munnings, got hold of some of Spencer&#x27;s &quot;Scrapbook Drawings&quot; and initiated a police prosecution against Spencer for obscenity. It was reported in the press that the, unnamed, owner of the pictures agreed to destroy them. Spencer also appears to have removed some drawings from his private scrapbooks and continued to ensure that the &quot;Leg of mutton nude&quot; would not be exhibited during his lifetime. He was appointed a CBE and the new President of the Royal Academy, Sir Gerald Kelly, who had supported Spencer in the obscenity case, persuaded him to rejoin the Royal Academy, as an Associate before being elected an Academician. Spencer visited his elder brother Harold in Northern Ireland in 1951, 1952 and 1953, painting portraits of Harold&#x27;s daughter, Daphne, and urban scenes there, most notably &quot;Merville Garden Village near Belfast&quot; in 1951. In 1952 Spencer made a small number of lithographs on the theme of the &quot;Marriage at Cana&quot; which were published in a limited edition of thirty that year and reprinted in an edition of 70 after his death.

In the spring of 1954, the Chinese government invited various western delegations to visit China for the fifth anniversary celebrations of the &quot;Liberation&quot; of October 1949. Members of the hastily assembled &quot;cultural delegation&quot; included Stanley Spencer, Leonard Hawkes, Rex Warner, Hugh Casson and A. J. Ayer. Spencer told Zhou Enlai that &quot;I feel at home in China because I feel that Cookham is somewhere near, only just around the corner.&quot; Towards the end of 1955, a large retrospective of Spencer&#x27;s work was held at the Tate and he began a series of large paintings centred on the work &quot;Christ Preaching at Cookham Regatta&quot;, which were intended for the Church-House.

In his later years Spencer was seen as a &quot;small man with twinkling eyes and shaggy grey hair, often wearing his pyjamas under his suit if it was cold.&quot; Spencer became a &quot;familiar sight, wandering the lanes of Cookham pushing the old pram in which he carried his canvas and easel.&quot; A scene of Spencer pushing his easel along in a pram, and surrounded by angels, was the subject of the painting &quot;Homage to Spencer&quot; by the artist Derek Clarke. The pram, black and battered, has survived to become an exhibit in the Stanley Spencer Gallery in Cookham, which is dedicated to Spencer&#x27;s life and works.

In 1958 Spencer painted &quot;The Crucifixion&quot; which was set in Cookham High Street and first displayed in Cookham Church. The painting employed a similar composition and viewpoint to an earlier painting, &quot;The Scarecrow, Cookham&quot; (1934) but with the two gargoyle-like carpenters nailing Christ to the cross and a screaming crucified thief, was by far the most violent of all Spencer&#x27;s paintings. Spencer was made an Honorary Doctor of Letters by Southampton University in 1958, three days before he received his knighthood at Buckingham Palace.
In December 1958 Spencer was diagnosed with cancer. He underwent an operation at the Canadian Red Cross Memorial Hospital on the Cliveden estate in 1959. After his operation, he went to stay with friends in Dewsbury. There, over five days from July 12 to July 16 he painted a final self-portrait. &quot;Self-Portrait&quot; (1959) shows a fierce, almost defiant individual. Lord Astor made arrangements so that Spencer could move into his childhood home, Fernlea, and he died of cancer at the Canadian Red Cross Memorial Hospital in December that year. At the time of his death &quot;Christ Preaching at Cookham Regatta&quot; remained unfinished at his home. Spencer was cremated and his ashes interred in Cookham churchyard, beside the path through to Bellrope Meadow. A discreet stone memorial marks the spot. The commemorative wording is: &quot;To the memory of Stanley Spencer Kt. CBE RA, 1891–1959, and his wife Hilda, buried in Cookham cemetery 1950. Everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God: He that loveth not knoweth not God, for God is love.&quot;

==Art market==
The value of Spencer&#x27;s paintings soared after a retrospective exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1980. &quot;The Resurrection; waking up&quot; fetched £770,000 at Christie&#x27;s early in 1990, and in May of that year his &quot;Crucifixion&quot; (1958) fetched £1,320,000. &quot;It was an all-time record for a modern British painting, and would have astounded Stanley, who was poor for so long.&quot; On 6 June 2011 &quot;Sunflower and Dog Worship&quot; sold for £5.4m, beating a record of £4.7m set a few minutes earlier for &quot;Workmen in the House&quot;.

==Archives==
In 1973 the Tate acquired a large proportion of the Spencer family archives. These included Spencer&#x27;s notebooks, sketchbooks and correspondence including the weekly letters he wrote to his sister Florence, while he was stationed in Salonika during the First World War. Spencer was a prolific writer of lists and the archive contains several that offer insights to specific paintings plus other material such as lists of rooms for the Church-House project, lists of plants in his own paintings and even a list of the jewellery he bought for Patricia Preece. Other correspondence by Spencer, some of which also dates from the First World War, is held in the archives of the Stanley Spencer Gallery in Cookham. Tate Britain holds the largest collection of Spencer works in the world, but the largest collection on display at any one time is at the Stanley Spencer Gallery.

<text>The renal cortex is the outer portion of the kidney between the renal capsule and the renal medulla. In the adult, it forms a continuous smooth outer zone with a number of projections (cortical columns) that extend down between the pyramids. It contains the renal corpuscles and the renal tubules except for parts of the loop of Henle which descend into the renal medulla. It also contains blood vessels and cortical collecting ducts.

The renal cortex is the part of the kidney where ultrafiltration occurs. Erythropoietin is produced in the renal cortex.

<text>Kalamunda () is a town and eastern suburb of Perth, Western Australia, located in the Darling Scarp at the eastern limits of the Perth metropolitan area.

==History==
Indigenous Noongar people were the first inhabitants of the area. The first permanent European settlers were the family of Frederick and Elizabeth Stirk, who arrived in 1881 and established a property called &quot;Headingly Hill&quot; at what is now &quot;Stirk Park&quot;; their house, Stirk Cottage, is now a museum. More settlers moved in during the 1890s, aided by the advent of the Kalamunda Zig Zag railway. At this time the Kalamunda area was known as &quot;Gooseberry Hill&quot;. The name &quot;Kalamunda&quot; was declared on 13 December 1901 after a request from thirty-two residents to form a townsite. They requested the name &quot;Calamunnda&quot;, derived from two words in the indigenous Noongar language, as recorded in a book by Bishop Rosendo Salvado: meaning &quot;fire&quot;, &quot;home&quot;, &quot;district&quot;, or &quot;settlement&quot; and meaning &quot;forest&quot; or &quot;bush&quot;. Surveyor-General Harry Johnston respelt the name as &quot;Kalamunnda&quot; and it was changed to &quot;Kalamunda&quot; by 1901. The local government area&#x27;s unofficial motto is &quot;A home in the forest&quot;.

==Environment==

===Geography===
At above sea level, Kalamunda and the surrounding areas experience colder night temperatures than the bulk of the Perth Metropolitan area to the west. Deep clay soils in the valleys in this area provide ideal growing conditions for stone fruits, apples and pears, wine production and for a small commercial rose growing industry.

The suburb of Gooseberry Hill is located to the north of Kalamunda where the terrain drops away sharply to the Helena Valley effectively isolating Kalamunda from other Darling Scarp population centres to the north. To the south and east the urban area transitions into the semi-rural and orchard growing areas of Bickley, Carmel and Pickering Brook, which in turn give way to extensive jarrah and marri forests.

Located nearby is the Kalamunda National Park and the northern terminus of the Bibbulmun Track, a recreational walking trail.

===Important Bird Area===
The town lies within the Mundaring-Kalamunda Important Bird Area, so identified by BirdLife International because of its importance as a non-breeding season roost site and foraging base for Long-billed Black Cockatoos.

===Climate===
Kalamunda has a Mediterranean climate with hot dry summers and cool wet winters. Due to the suburb&#x27;s high elevation of around above mean sea level and location on the Darling Scarp, it is a few degrees cooler in winter than Perth; however, this difference is less pronounced in summer as Kalamunda is less affected than Perth by the regular afternoon sea breeze, the Fremantle Doctor, due to its inland location. Kalamunda is far wetter than the city with over of annual rainfall, due to its location in the Darling Scarp.

==Transport==

Kalamunda Road serves as a major access road for Perth Airport, and provides the foothills suburbs with access to the Perth central business district. The suburb is serviced by the Kalamunda bus station, which provides bus services across the Perth metropolitan area.

Kalamunda was once part of a thriving logging region, with Kalamunda railway station the largest station on the Upper Darling Range railway. The area has a number of features as a result of this railway including a museum at the site of the original station. Typical rail side road structures with a rail reserve between and the Zig Zag road on the old section where the railway climbed the Darling Scarp. It is at Gooseberry Hill that the railway used to descend from the hills to Midland Junction, dropping in a series of five zig-zag shunts. The railway line has been replaced by a single lane, one-way scenic drive that follows the old track.

==Facilities==
Kalamunda has extensive areas with orchards, primarily involved in apple and stone fruit production. The region largely serves as a dormitory suburb for Perth workers. It has a modest retail, government and education sector, and a small industrial base. While the town&#x27;s retail centre is the largest in the Darling Scarp it primarily services Kalamunda and the contiguous urbanised areas of Lesmurdie and Walliston.

Kalamunda and the surrounding areas have an arts and crafts tradition, and are home to three major Perth residential colleges. Conservation groups are active within the community, and efforts have been made (largely successfully) to maintain native vegetation adjacent to the urban areas, and to some extent with the urban area.

Kalamunda is home to the television towers of all free-to-air Perth Television stations, and the approach control radar for Perth Airport.

==Demographics==
In the , Kalamunda had a population of 6,970; 48.3% male and 51.7% female. The median age of Kalamunda residents was 47, and median weekly personal income was $676. Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people made up 0.7% of the population.

The most popular religious affiliations in descending order in the 2016 census were No Religion 33.1%, Catholic 22.4%, Anglican 18.8%, Not Stated 9.0% and Christian, nfd 3.8%. Christianity was the largest religious group reported overall (61.4%) (this figure excludes not stated responses).

The population profile of Kalamunda is slightly in advance of the Perth Metropolitan area with a media age of 47, compared with Perth Metropolitan areas median age of 36, and it is likely that in time it will develop a large retirement population. The population of Kalamunda and the surrounding areas have a diverse ethnicity. Notably however, there are many Italian families who became involved in the orchard industry in the post-Second World War migration period.

Despite the steady encroach of the urban sprawl in recent times which has eroded the sense of a &#x27;regional centre&#x27;, Kalamunda remains a quiet town amongst the jarrah forests on the Darling Scarp.

Short stay accommodation in a forest setting close to Perth is a growth area, and Kalamunda is increasingly offering ecotourism experiences for local and overseas visitors.

<text>Homing pigeons have long played an important role in war. Due to their homing ability, speed, and altitude, they were often used as military messengers. Carrier pigeons of the Racing Homer breed were used to carry messages in World War I and World War II, and 32 such pigeons were presented with the Dickin Medal. Medals such as the Croix de Guerre, awarded to Cher Ami, and the Dickin Medal awarded to the pigeons G.I. Joe and Paddy, amongst 32 others, have been awarded to pigeons for their services in saving human lives.

During World War I and World War II, carrier pigeons were used by the Australian, French, German, American, and UK forces, to transport messages back to their home coop behind the lines. When they landed, wires in the coop would sound a bell or buzzer and a soldier of the Signal Corps would know a message had arrived. The soldier would go to the coop, remove the message from the canister, and send it to its destination by telegraph, field phone, or personal messenger.

A carrier pigeon&#x27;s job was dangerous. Nearby, enemy soldiers often tried to shoot down pigeons, knowing that released birds were carrying important messages. Some of these pigeons became quite famous amongst the infantrymen for whom they worked. One pigeon, named “Spike”, flew 52 missions without receiving a single wound. Another, named Cher Ami, lost his foot and one eye, but his message got through, saving a large group of surrounded American infantrymen.

== History ==
Before the advent of radio, carrier pigeons were frequently used on the battlefield as a means for a mobile force to communicate with a stationary headquarters. In the sixth century BC, Cyrus, king of Persia, used carrier pigeons to communicate with various parts of his empire. In Ancient Rome, Julius Caesar used pigeons to send messages to the territory of Gaul.

During the 19th-century (1870–71) Franco-Prussian War, besieged Parisians used carrier pigeons to transmit messages outside the city; in response, the besieging Prussian Army employed hawks to hunt the pigeons. The French military used balloons to transport homing pigeons past enemy lines. Microfilm images containing hundreds of messages allowed letters to be carried into Paris by pigeon from as far away as London. More than one million different messages traveled this way during the four-month siege. They were then discovered to be very useful, and carrier pigeons were well considered in military theory leading up to World War I.

=== World War I ===

Homing pigeons were used extensively during World War I. In 1914, during the First Battle of the Marne, the French army advanced 72 pigeon lofts with the troops. The US Army Signal Corps used 600 pigeons in France alone.

One of their homing pigeons, a Blue Check cock named Cher Ami, was awarded the French &quot;Croix de Guerre with Palm” for heroic service delivering 12 important messages during the Battle of Verdun. On his final mission in October 1918, he delivered a message over despite having been shot through the breast or wing. The crucial message, found in the capsule hanging from a ligament of his shattered leg, saved 194 US soldiers of the 77th Infantry Division&#x27;s “Lost Battalion&quot; in the Battle of the Argonne, in October 1918. When Cher Ami died, he was mounted and is part of the permanent exhibit at the National Museum of American History of the Smithsonian Institution.

United States Navy aviators maintained 12 pigeon stations in France, with a total inventory of 1,508 pigeons when the war ended. Pigeons were carried in airplanes to rapidly return messages to these stations, and 829 birds flew in 10,995 wartime aircraft patrols. Airmen of the 230 patrols with messages entrusted to pigeons threw the message-carrying pigeon either up or down, depending on the type of aircraft, to keep the pigeon out of the propeller and away from airflow toward the aircraft wings and struts. Eleven of the thrown pigeons went missing in action, but the remaining 219 messages were delivered successfully.
Pigeons were considered an essential element of naval aviation communication when the first United States aircraft carrier was commissioned on 20 March 1922, so the ship included a pigeon house on the stern. The pigeons were trained at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard while &quot;Langley&quot; was undergoing conversion. As long as the pigeons were released a few at a time for exercise, they returned to the ship; but when the whole flock was released while &quot;Langley&quot; was anchored off Tangier Island, the pigeons flew south and roosted in the cranes of the Norfolk shipyard. The pigeons never went to sea again.

=== World War II and later deployments ===
During World War II, the United Kingdom used about 250,000 homing pigeons for many purposes, including communicating with those behind enemy lines such as Belgian spy Jozef Raskin. The Dickin Medal, the highest possible decoration for valor given to animals, was awarded to 32 pigeons, including the United States Army Pigeon Service&#x27;s G.I. Joe and the Irish pigeon Paddy.

The UK maintained the Air Ministry Pigeon Section during World War II and for a while thereafter. A Pigeon Policy Committee made decisions about the uses of pigeons in military contexts. The head of the section, Lea Rayner, reported in 1945 that pigeons could be trained to deliver small explosives or bioweapons to precise targets. The ideas were not taken up by the committee, and in 1948 the UK military stated that pigeons were of no further use. During the war, messenger pigeons could draw a special allowance of corn and seed, but as soon as the war ended this had been cancelled and anyone keeping pigeons would have to draw on their own personal rationed corn and seed to also feed the pigeons. However, the UK security service MI5 was still concerned about the use of pigeons by enemy forces. Until 1950, they arranged for 100 birds to be maintained by a civilian pigeon fancier in order to prepare for any eventuality. The Swiss army disbanded its Pigeon section in 1996.

=== 21st Century ===
In 2010, Indian police expressed suspicion that a recently captured pigeon from Pakistan might have been carrying a message from Pakistan. In 2015, a pigeon from Pakistan was logged into Indian records as a &quot;suspected spy&quot;. In May 2020, another suspected Pakistani spy pigeon was captured by Indian security forces in Jammu and Kashmir. After finding nothing suspicious, India authorities released the pigeon back into Pakistan.

In 2016, a Jordanian border official said at a news conference that Islamic State militants were using homing pigeons to deliver messages to operatives outside its &quot;so called caliphate&quot;.

== Decorated war pigeons ==
In total, 32 pigeons were decorated with the Dickin Medal, including:
* All Alone (1943)
* Winkie (1943)
* Tyke (1943) 
* White Vision (1943)
* Commando (1944)
* Paddy (1944)
* William of Orange (1944)
* Mary of Exeter (1945)
* G.I. Joe (1946)
* Gustav (1944)
* Beach Comber (1944)
* Royal Blue (1945)

A grand ceremony was held in Buckingham Palace to commemorate a platoon of pigeons that braved the battlefields of Normandy to deliver vital plans to Allied forces on the fringes of Germany. Three of the actual birds that received the medals are on show in the London Military Museum so that well-wishers can pay their respects. 

In Brussels, there is a monument commemorating pigeons that served in World War I, the &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="674754" wikidata="Q955020" url="?curid=674754" title="Renal pelvis">
<text>The renal pelvis or pelvis of the kidney is the funnel-like dilated part of the ureter in the kidney. It is formed by the convergence of the major calyces, acting as a funnel for urine flowing from the major calyces to the ureter. It has a mucous membrane and is covered with transitional epithelium and an underlying lamina propria of loose-to-dense connective tissue.

The renal pelvis is situated within the renal sinus alongside the other structures of the renal sinus.

==Clinical significance==
The renal pelvis is the location of several kinds of kidney cancer and is affected by infection in pyelonephritis. A large &quot;staghorn&quot; kidney stone may block all or part of the renal pelvis.

The size of the renal pelvis plays a major role in the grading of hydronephrosis. Normally, the anteroposterior diameter of the renal pelvis is less than 4 mm in fetuses up to 32 weeks of gestational age and 7 mm afterwards. In adults, 13% of the normal population have a transverse pelvic diameter of over 10 mm.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
Like the bony pelvis, the renal pelvis () gets its English name via Neo-Latin from the older Latin word &quot;&quot;, &quot;basin&quot;, as in &quot;wash basin&quot;. In both cases the name reflects the shape of the structure, and in the case of the renal pelvis, it also reflects the function. The name reflects that each renal pelvis collects urine from the calyces and funnels it into the ureter like a wash basin collects water and funnels it into a drain pipe. The renal pelvis is occasionally called the pyelum (from Greek πύελος &quot;pýelos&quot;, &quot;trough&quot;, ‘anything hollow’), and the combining form &quot;&quot; denotes the renal pelvis (&quot;pyelo-&quot; is not to be confused with &quot;&quot;). The words &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; are other words for funnel-shaped cavities (which medical English got from the Latin and Greek words for &quot;funnel&quot;, respectively), and the renal pelvis is sometimes called the renal infundibulum. The form &quot;*renal choana&quot; is logical but is not used.

<text>Miguel Ángel Cuellar Santana (; May 8, 1937 – April 2, 2010) was a Cuban professional baseball player. He played for 15 seasons in Major League Baseball as a left-handed pitcher in 1959 and from 1964 through 1977, most prominently as a member of the Baltimore Orioles who won the American League (AL) pennant in each of Cuellar&#x27;s first three seasons with the team. During that time, Cuellar and the Orioles won the 1970 World Series. Cuellar also played for the Cincinnati Reds, St. Louis Cardinals, Houston Astros and California Angels.

Cuellar and Denny McLain each won the AL Cy Young Award in 1969, due to a tie in the voting. For the Orioles, Cuellar won 20-or-more games in a season four times from 1969 through 1974. Along with Jim Palmer, Dave McNally, and Pat Dobson, he was one of four Oriole starters to win at least 20 games in 1971. Cuellar, nicknamed &quot;Crazy Horse&quot; because of his superstitious nature, ranks among Baltimore&#x27;s top five career leaders in wins (143), strikeouts (1,011), shutouts (30) and innings pitched (2,028). In 1982, Cuellar was inducted into the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame.

==Life and career==
===Early life and first stints in the majors===
Miguel Angel Cuellar Santana was born in Santa Clara, Cuba, on May 8, 1937. One of four brothers, Cuellar&#x27;s family made their living working in Cuban sugar mills. Not interested in pursuing that as a career, Cuellar joined the Cuban Army, which allowed him to play baseball on weekends. He threw a no-hitter for an army team in 1955, drawing attention from scouts. Following his army service, he pitched for a Nicaraguan independent team in 1956, then joined the Almendares winter league team over the offseason.

In the 1950s, the Cincinnati Reds executed a working agreement with the Havana Sugar Kings of the Triple-A International League (IL), helping them acquire many Cuban players, including Cuellar. Cuellar struck out seven Montreal Royals in just over two innings of work in his first game with Havana in 1957. Used as a starting pitcher and as a relief pitcher (44 games, 16 starts), he posted an 8–7 record and led the IL in earned run average (ERA) with a 2.44 mark. The next season, he had a 2.77 ERA and a 13–12 record, pitching 220 innings.

Entering the 1959 season, Cuellar was featured on a baseball card in a &quot;Topps&quot; set for the very first time, though the company misspelled his name as &quot;Cueller.&quot; Part of Cincinnati&#x27;s roster to begin the season, Cuellar made his major league debut with Cincinnati against the Philadelphia Phillies at Crosley Field on April 18, 1959. He entered the contest in relief of Don Newcombe in the second inning with the Reds losing 4–2. In his two innings of work, Cuellar surrendered a grand slam to Gene Freese in the third and a two-run double to Al Schroll in the fourth. The Reds went on to lose 14–9. His only other appearance with the Reds came three days later against the Milwaukee Braves. Again he pitched two innings in relief, giving up two runs as the Reds lost 7–4. After that, he was returned to Havana; it would be several years before he pitched in the major leagues again.

For the rest of 1959, Cuellar had a 10–11 record and 111 strikeouts. Though his 11 losses were tied with four others for eighth in the league, he ranked eighth with a 2.80 ERA and fifth with 220 innings pitched. Havana won the IL championship and defeated the Minneapolis Millers in the Junior World Series.

The Sugar Kings moved to Jersey City, New Jersey, in the middle of the 1960 season in response to Fidel Castro&#x27;s nationalization of American businesses in Cuba. In 33 games (21 starts) for the franchise, Cuellar had a 6–9 record, a 3.53 ERA, and 74 strikeouts in 148 innings pitched. He split the 1961 season between three Triple-A teams: Jersey City of the IL and the Indianapolis Indians of the American Association (both Reds affiliates) and the Syracuse Chiefs of the IL (an affiliate of the Minnesota Twins). Exact statistics for this year are unknown.

Cuellar spent the 1962 season with the Sultanes de Monterrey of the Triple-A Mexican League, appearing in 37 games. He split the 1963 minor league season between affiliates of the Detroit Tigers and Cleveland Indians. For the Knoxville Smokies (Detroit) of the Double-A South Atlantic League, he had a 1–1 record, a 2.54 ERA, and 39 strikeouts. With the IL&#x27;s Jacksonville Suns (Cleveland), he had a 6–7 record, a 3.79 ERA, and 85 strikeouts in 24 games (16 starts).

After being stuck in the minors for five years, Cuellar experienced improvement in 1964. During the offseason, while he had been playing winter ball, teammate Ruben Gomez had suggested he start throwing a screwball. Signed by the St. Louis Cardinals in 1964, Cuellar used the pitch about 30 percent of the time while pitching for Jacksonville, now an affiliate of the Cardinals. He made 10 starts for Jacksonville, posting a 1.78 ERA while winning six of seven decisions. Seeing his success, the Cardinals decided to promote him in mid-June.

Cuellar was used primarily as a relief pitcher for the rest of the year, though he also made seven starts. One of these came in the second game of a doubleheader against the Pittsburgh Pirates; Cuellar allowed five runs in innings but earned the win (his first) in a 12–5 Cardinal victory. Cuellar also beat the Pirates on August 26, this time allowing just two runs in a complete game, 4–2 victory. Freese, who had hit a grand slam off of Cuellar five years earlier, made the last out. The hitter said that &quot;he&#x27;s a lot faster and has come with quite a scroogie&quot;. In 32 games (seven starts), Cuellar had a 5–5 record, a 4.50 ERA, 56 strikeouts, 33 walks, and 80 hits allowed in 72 innings pitched. The Cardinals made a late-season surge as the Phillies collapsed in September. This took the Cardinals and Cuellar to the 1964 World Series. Though Cuellar did not pitch in any of the games, he became a World Series champion for the first time as the Cardinals defeated the New York Yankees in seven games.

In 1965, Cuellar failed to make the Cardinals roster and was assigned to Jacksonville to begin the year. With the Suns, he posted a 2.51 ERA and a 9–1 record. At the June 15 trade deadline, Cuellar and Ron Taylor were traded to the Houston Astros for Hal Woodeshick and Chuck Taylor.

===Houston Astros (1965–68)===
Cuellar spent the rest of 1965 in the major leagues with the Astros, mainly as a relief pitcher, though he also made four starts. He posted a 5.81 ERA in his first 15 games, then posted an 0.72 ERA in his last 10. Twice in September, he had relief outings in which he pitched more than five scoreless innings. His record for the season was 1–4, and he struck out 46 batters in 56 innings, posting a 3.54 ERA.

After beginning the 1966 season as a relief pitcher, Cuellar was added to the starting rotation on April 25. Facing the Reds, Cuellar held his old team to five hits and one unearned run in a 2–1 victory. After Cuellar posted a 1.29 ERA in his first four starts, manager Grady Hatton said: &quot;I&#x27;ve created a monster&quot;. Hatton explained: &quot;For a while, all Cuellar wanted to do was throw screwballs. But this year, he&#x27;s mixing &#x27;em up with fast balls and curves, and making the batters hit the ball. He&#x27;s got good control and a good fast ball, and he&#x27;s finally making use of them.&quot; Cuellar had learned the curveball from Astro pitching coach Gordon Jones, and he was also throwing his screwball on 50-60 percent of his pitches. He strained a muscle in his side and had to leave a game on May 21 but was back to action by June 2. Cuellar ultimately won his first six decisions, the last a 3–2 complete game over the Cardinals at the Astrodome on June 25, in which he recorded a career-high 15 strikeouts. He suffered two close losses during the campaign. On August 12, he held the San Francisco Giants to four hits and one run in eight innings, but Gaylord Perry of the Giants threw a 92-pitch shutout. On September 10, he and Don Drysdale of the Dodgers held each other&#x27;s teams scoreless through nine innings; Cuellar took the loss when he gave up a run in the 10th. Cuellar threw his first major league shutout on August 29, defeating the Pirates by a score of 2–0. In Cuellar&#x27;s final start of the campaign, a 4–3 road win over Cincinnati in the second match of a September 28 twi-night doubleheader, he hit his first major-league home run, off Sammy Ellis, to lead off the top of the fifth. Cuellar finished with a 12–10 record, 175 strikeouts, and a 2.22 ERA, (second in the National League (NL) to Sandy Koufax&#x27; 1.73).

Following a loss on May 17, 1967, Cuellar won six straight games, posting a 1.18 ERA over the span. The first of these was a 2–0 shutout of the Giants on May 21. He made the first of four All-Star Game appearances at Anaheim Stadium on July 11. He came into the contest in relief of Chris Short in the 11th. Of the seven batters he faced, the only baserunner he allowed in the two shutout innings he pitched was Carl Yastrzemski, who recorded a 12th-inning single. The NL eventually won 2–1 in 15 innings. On July 24, Cuellar had held the Phillies to one hit and no runs through eight innings, as Houston led 1–0. During the ninth, Philadelphia manager Gene Mauch called him a name from the dugout, hoping to start a fight and get both players ejected. Eddie Mathews of Houston acted as a peacemaker, but Cuellar would allow an unearned run in the inning (due to a Mathews error). However, he finished the game, allowing only two hits total as Houston prevailed 2–1 in 11 innings. He threw back-to-back shutouts on September 22 and 27 against the New York Mets and Philadelphia; the latter of these was an 11-inning game in which he struck out 12. Five times Cuellar struck out 10 or more batters in a game in 1967, the most coming on June 6, when he struck out 13 in a 3–2 win over the Cardinals. Cuellar improved his record to 16–11 in 1967, with a 3.03 ERA. He tied with four other pitchers for fifth in the NL in wins and ranked fifth in strikeouts (203, the most he would ever record in a season).

After the major league seasons, Cuellar had typically played winter baseball in Latin America over the offseasons. However, the Astros asked him not to do so in the 1967-68 offseason because they thought he was pitching too much. When he returned to the team in 1968, he complained of arm soreness. He pitched only once in April and did not make a start until May 19. Cuellar won his first three starts. On May 30, he threw a seven-hit shutout against the Braves in an 11–0 victory. He struck out a season-high 12 on June 21 and held the Phillies to one unearned run in a complete game, 2–1 victory. With a four-hit shutout of the Dodgers on July 29, Cuellar&#x27;s record improved to 6–5. However, he lost five straight decisions, not winning again until September 17. In 28 games (24 starts), he had an 8–11 record, though his ERA was 2.74. He struck out 133 batters in innings. On December 4, the Astros traded Cuellar, Enzo Hernández, and Tom Johnson to the Baltimore Orioles for Curt Blefary and John Mason.

===Baltimore Orioles (1969–76)===
====1969–71====
With Baltimore, Cuellar &quot;blossomed into a star,&quot; according to reporter Matt Schudel. As the pitcher joined fellow starters Jim Palmer and Dave McNally, and sluggers Frank Robinson, Brooks Robinson and Boog Powell, the Orioles began a three-year run atop the American League (AL) in 1969. In his Baltimore debut on April 10, he pitched 10 innings and allowed just one unearned run against the Boston Red Sox. Though he did not get a decision, the Orioles prevailed 2–1 in 13 innings. He threw 10 innings in another game on April 23 (this one a 3–2 win over the Tigers), then threw a shutout against the Yankees four days later. Facing the Kansas City Royals on May 10, he threw a two-hit shutout in a 5–0 victory. On June 17 and 21, Cuellar pitched a pair of complete-game four-hit, one-run victories, striking out 12 and nine batters respectively. He held the Red Sox to three hits on July 12 in a 4–0 shutout. In August, Cuellar retired 35 batters in a row. The streak was ended on August 10 by César Tovar of the Minnesota Twins, as Cuellar was three outs away from recording his first career no-hitter; Tovar&#x27;s hit, which came in the top of ninth inning, was the only one the Twins would manage against Cuellar in his complete-game shutout (a 2–0 victory). He won seven straight games from July 24 through August 19 (the last of which was a shutout of the California Angels), then won six straight from August 27 to September 18.

During the 1969 season, Cuellar achieved a win–loss record of 23–11, struck out 182 batters, and recorded a 2.38 ERA, as Baltimore won a club-record 109 games and the very first AL East Division title. Cuellar&#x27;s 23 wins ranked second in the AL to Denny McLain&#x27;s 24, his 2.38 ERA ranked third (behind Dick Bosman&#x27;s 2.19 and Palmer&#x27;s 2.34), and his 182 strikeouts tied Joe Coleman for fifth. His five shutouts were third behind McLain&#x27;s nine and Palmer&#x27;s six. For his outstanding year, Cuellar tied McLain for the AL Cy Young Award. Cuellar became the first pitcher born in Latin America to win the Cy Young Award. He also finished eighth in AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting.

The Orioles faced the Minnesota Twins in the American League Championship Series. In Game 1, Cuellar allowed three runs (two earned) in eight innings, leaving with his team trailing 3–2. Baltimore tied it in the ninth on a Boog Powell home run, then scored the winning run in the 12th on a Paul Blair RBI single to win the game 4–3. The Orioles went on to sweep the Twins three games to none en route to winning the American League Pennant and earning a berth in the World Series against the New York Mets. Cuellar again got the start in Game 1, allowing one run over four innings and outpitching Tom Seaver in a 4–1 victory. The two faced off again in Game 4; Cuellar pitched seven innings, allowing just a home run to Donn Clendenon, but the Orioles were losing 1–0 when Cuellar exited the game. Brooks Robinson tied the game with a sacrifice fly in the ninth, taking Cuellar off the hook for the loss, but the Orioles lost the game 2–1 in 10 innings. In the next game, the Mets completed one of the biggest World Series upsets ever, winning the 1969 Series four games to one against the heavily favored Orioles. Cuellar&#x27;s triumph in Game One wound up being the only Baltimore victory.

On May 29, 1970, Cuellar struck out 10 batters, including four in the same inning, as he threw a four-hit shutout against the Angels. Twice in the first half of the season, he allowed only two hits in a game, on May 24 and June 11 (both Oriole wins). He threw a four-hit shutout against the Tigers on July 3, then pitched all 10 innings of a 6–2 victory over the Yankees four days later. Cuellar made the All-Star team for the second time, picked by Weaver, who was managing the team. Through June, his ERA was 4.34 (though his record was 8–5), but Cuellar only lost three times for the rest of the season while winning 16 more games and posting a 2.78 ERA. On August 11, he threw a four-hit shutout against the Angels for the second time that season. On August 27, Cuellar became the second pitcher in the AL (after teammate McNally) to win 20 games, allowing 10 hits but earning the win in a 6–4 victory over the Athletics. He threw his fourth shutout of the season on September 9, necessary for Baltimore&#x27;s 1–0 victory over the Yankees. Cuellar&#x27;s win–loss record was 24–8 in 1970; he recorded a 3.48 ERA and 190 strikeouts. Cuellar&#x27;s 24 wins tied with McNally and Jim Perry for the major league lead. He led the AL in games started (40, tied with four others), and complete games (21), also ranking among the AL leaders in strikeouts (fifth), shutouts (four, tied with two others for third), and innings pitched (, third, behind Palmer and Sam McDowell&#x27;s 305). However, Cuellar finished in fourth place in the voting for the American League Cy Young Award. &quot;He should have won the Cy that year, but not doing so never affected his performance,&quot; teammate Palmer opined. In the AL MVP voting, Cuellar finished 11th. Cuellar, Palmer, and McNally combined for 68 wins, the most for a starting trio since three Detroit Tigers did so in 1944.

The Orioles faced the Twins again in the ALCS, and Cuellar started Game 1. Struggling on the mound in the cold weather at Metropolitan Stadium, he surrendered six runs in innings. However, he contributed offensively in the fourth inning, when he hit a pitch from Jim Perry that barely stayed fair as it passed over the right field fence for a grand slam. The Orioles won 10–6, then went on to sweep the Twins for the second year in a row.

Cuellar had a rocky start in Game 2 of the 1970 World Series against the Reds, lasting only innings and giving up four runs (though only one was earned). However, Baltimore rallied to win the game 6–5. In Game 5, Cuellar was hit hard early, giving up three runs to the Reds in the first inning. It was then that his pitching coach, George Bamberger, advised Cuellar to stop throwing his screwball for the rest of the game. Cuellar settled himself down and followed Bamberger&#x27;s advice by relying on his fastball, curveball, and changeup, to shut out the Reds for the next eight innings for an impressive 9-3 complete game victory that clinched the World Series title for the Orioles. Forty years later, reporter Mike Klingaman wrote, &quot;Of his 185 big league victories, none meant more than that World Series win to Cuellar.&quot;

Facing the Indians in his second start of the year on April 14, 1971, Cuellar only struck out two batters but only allowed four hits in a 3–0 shutout win. He took pleasure in a complete game, 3–2 win over the Indians on May 26. Earlier in the year, Cleveland manager Alvin Dark had said that Cuellar&#x27;s fastball &quot;couldn&#x27;t blacken an eye.&quot; He won 11 decisions in a row from May 12 through July 8, posting a 2.17 ERA in that span. The first of these was a 6–0 shutout of the Kansas City Royals on May 12 in which Jerry May had the only hit off of him, a third-inning single. He shut out the Milwaukee Brewers on June 4, then held the Minnesota Twins to one run in a complete game, 2–1 victory five days later. Teammate Pat Dobson was so impressed with Cuellar&#x27;s success, he started wearing his socks for good luck. With a 13–1 record and a 2.88 ERA in the first half, Cuellar was selected to his third All-Star Game. In the second half, he was only 7–8, but his ERA was 3.34. Against the Twins on August 10, he gave up Harmon Killebrew&#x27;s 500th home run. He held the White Sox to four hits on August 24 in a 1–0 shutout. In 1971, Cuellar&#x27;s regular-season win–loss record was 20–9, and he had a 3.08 ERA and 124 strikeouts. His 20 wins tied with four others for sixth in the AL, his four shutouts were tied with 10 others for seventh, his innings pitched were fourth in the AL (behind Mickey Lolich&#x27;s 376, Wilbur Wood&#x27;s 334, and Vida Blue&#x27;s 312), and his 21 complete games were also fourth (behind Lolich&#x27;s 29, Blue&#x27;s 24, and Wood&#x27;s 22). Palmer and McNally each won 20 games again, and newcomer Dobson did so as well, making the Orioles the first team to have four twenty-game winners since the 1921 Chicago White Sox. Though Cuellar did not get any Cy Young votes, he finished 24th in AL MVP voting.

This year in the ALCS, the Orioles faced the Athletics instead of the Twins. Cuellar started Game 2, allowing just one run and six hits in a complete game, 5–1 victory. The Orioles swept the ALCS for the third year in a row and earned a berth in the World Series against the Pirates. In Game 3, Cuellar allowed five runs (four earned) in six innings, suffering the defeat in the 5–1 loss. He allowed just two runs over eight innings in Game 7, but Steve Blass of the Pirates allowed only one run, and Pittsburgh won the series as Cuellar suffered a difficult loss.

====1972–76====
On May 26, 1972, Cuellar threw a four-hit shutout in a 2–0 victory over the Indians. He won only two of his first nine games in 1972, though his ERA was 3.50. After June 4, he posted a 16–7 record for the rest of the year, with a 2.36 ERA. Though striking out only two Yankees on June 28, he allowed five hits and no runs in a 4–0 shutout. A little over a month later, he allowed just three hits in a 5–0 shutout of the Yankees on July 30. On August 11, he struck out a season-high 13 batters in a 2–1 win over Boston. From August 25 through September 16, he won five straight decisions for the Orioles. Nine shutout innings on September 3 were not enough for a win as the Angels scored a run against Eddie Watt in the 10th to win 1–0, but Cuellar threw nine more shutout innings four days later, getting credit for the win this time in a 9–0 victory over the Tigers. In 35 starts, he had an 18–12 record, a 2.57 ERA, and 132 strikeouts in innings pitched. His 18 wins were tied with Clyde Wright for 10th in the AL.

Cuellar got off to a 2–6 start in 1973, posting a 5.00 ERA through June 9. Afterwards, he went 16–7, posting a 2.56 ERA. He held the Texas Rangers to three hits on June 15 in a 1–0 shutout. Ten days later, he pitched all 12 innings of a 4–3 win over the Brewers. On July 19, he struck out 12 batters and pitched all 11 innings of a 3–1 victory over the Angels. He threw a five-hit shutout against the White Sox on August 18 in a 3–0 victory. From August 9 through September 1, he won six starts in a row; after losing on September 5, he won his last four decisions of the year. On September 17, he allowed four runs (two earned) and struck out nine as he pitched all 10 innings of a 5–4 win over the Yankees. In 38 starts, he had an 18–13 record, a 3.27 ERA, and 140 strikeouts in 267 innings. After a one-year absence from the playoffs, the Orioles won the AL East again, facing the defending World Series Champion Athletics in the ALCS. The starter for Game 3, Cuellar pitched every inning of an 11-inning game, matching pace with Ken Holtzman of the Athletics for 10 innings before finally giving up a game-ending home run to Bert Campaneris in a 2–1 loss. The Athletics won the series in five games.

During 1974 spring training, Cuellar began parking in a special spot in the reporters-only parking lot, perhaps thinking that &quot;The Cuban Star&quot; referred to him. &quot;Who else is Cuban star on this club?&quot; he asked. Despite a broken toe, he was ready for the start of the season. After losing all three of his April decisions, he won nine straight decisions before finally suffering another loss on June 21. Included in that streak were two shutouts: a rain-shortened seven-inning game against Boston on May 17 and a 1–0 victory over the Twins on June 17. Against the Yankees on June 30, Cuellar struck out only one batter but threw a six-hit shutout in a June 30. He was selected to the All-Star Game for the fourth time in his career. On August 15, he struck out a season-high 10 batters and held the White Sox to six hits and one run in a complete game, 2–1 victory. After a loss on August 24, Cuellar won seven of his last nine games, and the two he did not get the decision in were also Oriole victories. In early September, Cuellar, Palmer, McNally, and Ross Grimsley set an AL record with five consecutive shutouts. Cuellar threw two in the streak, both 1–0 victories. Cuellar had a great season in , finishing with a win–loss record of 22–10, a 3.11 ERA, and 106 strikeouts. He led the AL in winning percentage with a .688 mark, and his 22 wins were third in the league behind Hunter&#x27;s and Fergie Jenkins&#x27;s 25. Cuellar pitched 20 complete games (tied with Steve Busby for eighth), including five shutouts (tied with Jim Bibby for fourth), as he earned a sixth-place finish in the Cy Young Award voting. From 1969 through 1974, Cuellar&#x27;s .665 winning percentage was the best in the major leagues.

Again, the Orioles won the Eastern Division and faced the Athletics in the ALCS. In Game 1, Cuellar gave up three runs over eight innings, pitching craftily and earning the victory as the Orioles won 6–3. He allowed just one hit in Game 4, but his control was not good; he walked nine hitters and was lifted in the fifth inning after walking in a run. The Athletics only scored one more all game, but that was enough for a series-clinching, 2–1 win. It would be Cuellar&#x27;s final postseason start; in playoff games, he had gone 4–4 and posted a 2.85 ERA.

In Cuellar&#x27;s second start of 1975 on April 16, he allowed just three hits in a 2–0 shutout of the Brewers. On May 31, a third-inning single by Bruce Bochte was the only hit Cuellar allowed in a 1–0, shutout victory over the Angels. He gave up six hits in a shutout of the Red Sox on June 22, a 6–0 victory in the first game of a doubleheader. After the Tigers knocked Cuellar out in the second inning of a game on June 26, 1975, he returned three days later and held Detroit to five hits and one run in a complete game, 2–1 victory. On July 26, he took a no-hitter into the seventh inning against the Brewers and finished with one hit allowed (a single to George Scott) and 10 strikeouts in a 4–0 victory over the Brewers. He allowed just two hits on August 11 in a 4–0 shutout of the Royals. On September 2, in the first game of a doubleheader against Cleveland, he pitched all 10 innings, allowing 11 hits but just two runs as the Orioles won 3–2. Cuellar&#x27;s ERA in 1975 was 3.66, the highest it had been since 1964-though his five shutouts tied his career high, his pitching was not as consistent as usual. He had a 14–12 record and struck out 105 batters in 256 innings. The five shutouts tied with three others for third in the AL, behind Palmer&#x27;s 10 and Hunter&#x27;s seven.

By 1976, Cuellar was 39 years old, and his age negatively impacted his performance. He did shut out the Rangers on June 20, limiting Texas to three hits in a 2–0 victory. After posting a 4–12 record and a 5.14 ERA through the end of July, he was moved to the bullpen. He made five relief appearances for the Orioles in August, then did not pitch at all once the Orioles made their September call-ups. In 26 games (19 starts), he had a 4–13 record, a 4.96 ERA, and 32 strikeouts in 107 innings pitched. He was released on December 21, ending his eight-year tenure with the Orioles. With the Orioles, Cuellar would enjoy three consecutive 20-win seasons.

===California Angels (1977), later career===
On January 25, 1977, Cuellar was signed by the California Angels. Harry Dalton, their general manager (GM), was friends with Cuellar from his time as the Orioles&#x27; GM previously. However, Cuellar struggled in spring training and did not even appear in a regular season game until April 26, California&#x27;s 19th game of the season. In a start against the Yankees on May 3, Cuellar allowed seven hits and six runs in innings, taking the loss in an 8–1 defeat. He was released on May 16, having only appeared in two games. That would be the end of his major league career.

In 1979, Cuellar joined the San Juan Boricuas of the newly created independent Inter-American League. He suffered a pulled hamstring in his third start but continued to appear in games despite the injury. Plagued by financial troubles and visa issues, the league folded on June 30. Cuellar continued to play in Puerto Rican winter leagues and the Mexican League through 1983 before retiring for good. While in Puerto Rico in 1983, he taught Willie Hernández how to throw a screwball. Hernández would win the AL Cy Young and MVP Awards in 1984.

During his 15-season career, Cuellar had a win–loss record of 185–130 with a 3.14 ERA, 1,632 strikeouts, 172 complete games, 36 shutouts, and 11 saves in 453 games and 2,808 innings pitched. In five American League Championship Series and three World Series appearances, Cuellar pitched in 12 games, winning four games and losing four with a 2.85 ERA while recording 56 strikeouts.

==Pitching style==
Cuellar was a &quot;junkball&quot; pitcher, relying heavily on his excellent screwball and change-up rather than a hard fastball, according to &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; reporter Mike Klingaman. Klingaman observed that by cleverly selecting which pitches to throw, Cuellar set up hitters for strikeouts. Fellow Oriole pitcher Dick Hall recalled: &quot;To watch him pitch was amazing. It seemed like every time hitters took a pitch, it was right at the knees for a strike, and if they swung, it wasn&#x27;t.&quot; &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; said he had &quot;the trickiest screwball since Carl Hubbell.&quot; In 2016, they said he had the fifth-best screwball of all time. Ken McMullen of the Angels said: &quot;Cuellar&#x27;s screwball is a pitch nobody else in baseball throws, and he can change speeds on it&quot;. &quot;Miguel was a magician out there,&quot; said Oriole first baseman Boog Powell. &quot;He made hitters look comical, like they could have swung three times before the ball got there. A couple of times, I almost had to call time-out because I was laughing my head off.&quot; He tended to struggle early in a season, then pitch better as the weather got warmer. &quot;Cold weather no good for baseball or me,&quot; he said. Usually he displayed a quiet personality and worked quickly on the mound, but struggles could occasionally cause him to lose his temper.

==Personal life==
When Cuellar joined the Orioles, he was in the process of breaking up with his wife, and he was struggling with debt. He divorced soon after he joined the team, leaving his wife and 2 children, and the Orioles helped rectify his financial issues. Shortly after joining Baltimore, he married Myriam, who would be his wife for the rest of his life. He had two additional children: Lydia and Mike, Jr. The Toronto Blue Jays signed Mike Jr. his first son, as a minor league pitcher in 1978, and he spent five years in their organization, advancing as far as Double-A with the Knoxville Blue Jays.

After his baseball career ended, Cuellar resided in the Orlando, Florida, metropolitan area. He worked at a golf course, also helping out during Orioles&#x27; spring training each year. For a while, he was a pitching coach in Puerto Rico, and he served as an instructor for the Orioles in the latter years of his life. He also was a frequent attendee when the Orioles had team reunions.

On April 2, 2010, Cuellar died of stomach cancer at the Orlando Regional Medical Center. He was the third of the Orioles&#x27; four 20-game winners in 1971 to perish, following Dave McNally in 2002 and Pat Dobson in 2006. Only Jim Palmer survives them.

==Legacy==
Along with Palmer and McNally, Cuellar gave the Orioles one of the best starting rotations in history during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Blair recalled that &quot;With Cuellar, McNally, and Palmer, you could almost ring up 60 wins for us when the season started because each of them was going to win 20. And with Cuellar and McNally, you never knew they were winning 10-0 or losing 0-10. They were the same guys. They were two really great left-handers, and the reason they were so great was they didn&#x27;t have the talent Palmer had. They didn&#x27;t have the 95-mile-per-hour fastball Palmer had. They had to learn to pitch, know the hitters, hit corners, and they did it. And they never complained. Those kind of guys, you just die for. You break your neck to go out there and win for them.” Palmer remembered him as &quot;like an artist. He could paint a different picture every time he went out there. He could finesse you. He could curveball you to death or screwball you to death. From 1969 to ’74, he was probably the best left-hander in the American League.”

Cuellar ranks among Baltimore&#x27;s top five career leaders in wins (143, fourth behind Palmer&#x27;s 268, McNally&#x27;s 181, and Mike Mussina&#x27;s 147), strikeouts (1,011, fifth), shutouts (30, third behind Palmer&#x27;s 53 and McNally&#x27;s 33) and innings pitched (fifth, 2,028). He trails only Dave McNally among left-handers in wins and shutouts. He is among the Orioles&#x27; single-season records in other categories, as well. His 24 wins in 1970 are tied for second-most behind Steve Stone&#x27;s 25 in 1981, and Cuellar holds two of the other top 10 win seasons as well (his 23 in 1969 are tied for sixth, and his 22 in 1974 are tied for ninth). He is one of four Orioles to make 40 starts in a season.

&quot;Crazy Horse&quot; was a nickname given Cuellar by his Oriole teammates because of his superstitious nature. Each game, he would sit in the same place on the team bench. He stayed in the dugout until his catcher put his gear on, refused to step on the foul line, and refrained from signing autographs on days he was pitching. In 1969, early success in games in which coach Jim Frey caught his pregame warmup pitches caused Cuellar to insist that Frey catch his pregame warmups for the rest of the year. During a game against the Indians on May 26, 1972, Cuellar twice refused to catch a baseball thrown to him. When Boog Powell finally got him to catch it on a third try, Cuellar asked for a new ball, which he also refused to catch until Bobby Grich finally rolled it to the mound. When he forgot his lucky cap on a road trip to Milwaukee, the Orioles had it airmailed to him before Cuellar&#x27;s start.

In 1982, Cuellar was inducted into the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame.

<doc id="674761" wikidata="Q1752136" url="?curid=674761" title="Renal capsule">
<text>The renal capsule is a tough fibrous layer surrounding the kidney and covered in a layer of perirenal fat known as the adipose capsule of kidney. The adipose capsule is sometimes included in the structure of the renal capsule. It provides some protection from trauma and damage. The renal capsule is surrounded by the renal fascia. Overlying the renal fascia and between this and the transverse fascia is a region of pararenal fat.

The renal capsule resists stretching, limiting renal swelling, with important implications for renal circulation. Stretching of the renal capsule due to swelling of the kidney causes flank pain.

== Structure ==
The renal capsule surrounds the functional tissue of the kidney, and is itself surrounded by a fatty adipose capsule, fascia, and fat. From the inner part of the kidney to outside the kidney, the positioning of the capsule is:
# renal medulla 
# renal cortex
# renal capsule
# adipose capsule of kidney (or perirenal fat, or perinephric fat)
# renal fascia
# pararenal fat
# peritoneum (anteriorly), and transverse fascia (posteriorly).

Sometimes the adipose capsule of the kidney also known as the perirenal fat, is regarded as a part of the renal capsule.

<doc id="674763" wikidata="Q335684" url="?curid=674763" title="Abubakar Tafawa Balewa">
<text>Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa (December 1912 – 15 January 1966) was a Nigerian politician who served as the first and only prime minister of Nigeria upon independence. A conservative Anglophile, he favoured maintaining close ties with the British. During his first three years in office as prime minister, Nigeria was a constitutional monarchy with Elizabeth II reigning as Queen of Nigeria, until it became a republic in 1963. He was both a defender of Northern special interests and an advocate of Nigerian reform and unity.

==Early life==
Abubakar Tafawa Balewa was born in December 1912, in the Northern Nigeria Protectorate (modern-day Bauchi State). His father, Yakubu Dan Zala, was of Gere ethnicity, and his mother Fatima Inna was of Gere and Fulani descent. His father worked in the house of the district head of Lere, a district within the Bauchi Emirate. He took his name from two corrupted Fula language words: &quot;Tafari&quot; (Rock) and &quot;Baleri&quot; (Black), which resulted in being the childhood nickname &quot;Black Rock&quot;.

== Education ==
Balewa began his education at a Qur&#x27;anic school in Bauchi; when southern colonial administrators began to push for western education in the Northern region, Balewa was among the children sent to Tafawa Balewa Elementary School, after the Qur&#x27;anic school. Thereafter, he proceeded to Bauchi Provincial School. Like many of his contemporaries, he studied at Barewa College, then known as Katsina College, where he was student number 145. Ahmadu Rabah, later known as Ahmadu Bello, was student number 87 and was two years his senior, while Abubakar Imam was a year ahead of him. The college was several kilometers from Bauchi and was not close to a railway station nor other public transportation. During holidays, which was twice a year, Balewa trekked home, a journey of more than 400 kilometers. He trekked for 40 kilometers a day, before finding a resting place at a nearby village. In total, the journey took him 10 days.

Katsina College had British expatriate teachers, many of whom had been educated at leading British schools and then attended Cambridge or Oxford Universities. Students were taught in English, and speech was an important part of learning for the students. Apart from excellence in English, the school was also a training ground for teachers to be posted to the provincial and middle schools within the Northern Provinces of Nigeria.

Balewa completed his five-year education in 1933 and returned to Bauchi to teach at Bauchi Middle School. He taught at the school and rose to become a senior schoolmaster. In 1941, he became acquainted with a young Aminu Kano, who was posted to the school as a teacher. After a student unrest, investigations into student grievances indicted the headmaster, and in 1941 Balewa was nominated as the new headmaster. In 1944, Balewa and some other educated teachers in the Northern Provinces were chosen to study abroad at the University of London&#x27;s Institute of Education, which today forms part of University College London. Upon returning to Nigeria, he became an Inspector of Schools for the colonial administration and later entered politics.

== Early political activity ==
He was elected in 1946 to the Northern House of Assembly, and to the Legislative Council in 1947. As a legislator, he was a vocal advocate of the rights of Northern Nigeria. He supported hesitance by the North to become independent, based on the objection that the north and south regions were not on an equal footing. In the Northern Assembly, he sought more roles and responsibility in the Native Administration for the educated members of the emirates.

Together with Alhaji Sir Ahmadu Bello, who held the hereditary title of &quot;Sardauna&quot; of Sokoto, they proposed the transformation of the cultural organization, Jam&#x27;iyyar Mutanen Arewa, which means Northern People&#x27;s Congress (NPC) in English, to become a political platform for use as campaign platform during the elections of 1951. Balewa was elected vice president of the new party and subsequently resigned his post as headmaster of Bauchi Middle School. NPC won the plurality of votes to the regional House of Assembly in 1951.Balewa was among the new legislators in Kaduna. Under a new constitution, the Macpherson Constitution of 1951, an electoral college system was implemented whereby, some regional legislators were elected to the Federal House of Representatives in Lagos, and among the federal legislators, three members from each region would be appointed federal ministers with portfolio. Balewa was among those nominated to Lagos and along with Kashim Ibrahim and Muhammadu Ribadu were nominated to become ministers.

=== In government ===
Balewa entered the government in 1952 as Minister of Works, and later served as Minister of Transport during a time Nigeria was moving towards self-government. During his tenure at the transport ministry, both the Marine and Railway departments were transformed to corporations and the designs for a bridge over the Niger and plans for the Kainji Dam were developed.

== Chief minister (1957–1960) ==
In 1957, NPC won the plurality of votes in the Federal House of Representatives and Balewa became the Chief Minister and designated Prime Minister. As part of his plans to unify the country towards the move for independence in 1960, he formed a coalition government between the NPC and the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC), led by Nnamdi Azikiwe and also invited the Action Group (A.G.), the 1957 cabinet was constituted as an all party cabinet. Though, Awolowo, the leader of A.G. and premier of the Western region was skeptical of the plan, the national executive committee of Action Group party endorsed the National Government and Ayo Rosiji and Samuel Akintola were nominated by the party. During this period, Balewa developed a close relationship with K.O. Mbadiwe from NCNC and Akintola from AG.

== Prime minister (1960–1966) ==
Balewa retained the post as Prime Minister of Nigeria when Nigeria gained independence in 1960 and was reelected in 1964.

He announced independence in a motion to Parliament on 18 January 1959:

=== Domestic policy ===

==== The Republic ====
Nigeria adopted a new constitution in 1963 which abolished the monarchy and the office of governor-general, with Nigeria becoming a parliamentary republic within the Commonwealth with the Nnamdi Azikiwe as President of Nigeria and head of state.

==== Regional policy ====
Prior to Nigeria&#x27;s independence, a constitutional conference in 1954 had adopted a regional political framework for the country, with all regions given a considerable amount of political freedom. The three regions then were composed of diverse cultural groups. The premiers and some prominent leaders of the regions later took on a policy of guiding their regions against political encroachment from other regional leaders. Later on, this political environment influenced the Balewa administration. His term in office was turbulent, with regional factionalism constantly threatening his government.

However, a treason charge and conviction against one of the western region&#x27;s leaders, Obafemi Awolowo, led to protest and condemnation from many of his supporters. The 1965 election in the region later produced violent protests. Rioting and violence were soon synchronous with what was perceived as inordinate political encroachment and an over-exuberant election outcome for Awolowo&#x27;s western opponents.

=== Foreign policy ===
As Prime Minister of Nigeria, Balewa, from 1960 to 1961, doubled as Foreign Affairs advocate of Nigeria. In 1961, the Balewa government created an official Foreign Affairs and Commonwealth Relations ministerial position in favour of Jaja Wachuku who became, from 1961 to 1965, the first substantive Nigerian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Commonwealth Relations, later called External Affairs. A week after taking office, he arrived in the United States on his first foreign visit to address the United Nations.

==== Africa ====
However, as Prime Minister of Nigeria, Balewa played important roles in the continent&#x27;s formative indigenous rule. He was an important leader in the formation of the Organisation of African Unity and creating a cooperative relationship with French speaking African countries. He was also instrumental in negotiations between Moise Tshombe and the Congolese authorities during the Congo Crisis of 1960–1964. He led a vocal protest against the Sharpeville Massacre of 1960 and also entered into an alliance with Commonwealth ministers who wanted South Africa to leave the Commonwealth in 1961.

==== United States ====

He visited the US in 1961 for eight days, four of which he spent in Washington at Blair House. During his visit, he became the first Nigerian leader to address a Joint session of the United States Congress and visited the Islamic Center of Washington. He had an enormous amount of respect for President John F. Kennedy, describing him, and his age in particular as &quot;matured as that of any older statesman.&quot; He took part in the launch of the Syncom 2 NASA program, allowing him to phone for President Kennedy from the USNS Kingsport docked at Lagos Harbor via the SYNCOM satellite on 23 August 1963. It marked the first live two-way call between heads of government by satellite.

==== Commonwealth ====
Balewa, during his premiership, attached great importance to its Commonwealth membership, declaring in a UN speech, &quot;we shall not forget our old friends.&quot;

==== Eastern Bloc ====
Balewa had a pro-West orientation in his foreign policy, which represented for abhorrence to USSR and other Eastern Bloc states. As a result, the circulation of communist literature in Nigeria was banned and students were discouraged from taking Soviet educational scholarship. Balewa had personally assured the British government &quot;we shall use every means in our power to prevent the infiltration of communism and communist ideas into Nigeria.&quot; At one point, the Soviets were implicated in a plot to overthrow Balewa&#x27;s government.

=== Overthrow and murder ===
Balewa was overthrown and murdered in a military coup on 15 January 1966, as were many other leaders, including his old companion Sir Ahmadu Bello. The circumstances of his death still remain unresolved. His body was discovered at a roadside near Lagos six days after he was ousted from office. Balewa was buried in Bauchi. News of his assassination spurred violent riots throughout Northern Nigeria and ultimately led to the bloody counter-coup of July 1966.

==Literary work==
In 1933, Balewa wrote &quot;Shaihu Umar&quot;, a novella about a pious Muslim in response to a request by Rupert East, the head of the colonial Translation Bureau, to promote Hausa literature. &quot;Shaihu Umar&quot; was first published in 1934. An English translation by Mervyn Hiskett was published in 1967. Written in a prose homily structure, the protagonist, Shaihu Umar, recounts his events in his life&#x27;s history. Events and themes in the novel deal with the trans-Saharan slave trade, familial relationships and Islamic themes of submission to the will of God. &quot;Shaihu Umar&quot; was staged as a play in the 1970s and filmed by Adamu Halilu in 1976.

== Political views ==

=== Nigerian institutions ===
Balewa advocated for the creation of a Nigerian Privy Council to domestically replace the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in a speech to the Legislative Council in April 1952. This was due to its judicial committee&#x27;s seemingly insensitivities to regional differences in court cases.

==Honours==

In January 1960, Balewa was knighted by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Sheffield in May 1960. He was also awarded an honorary doctorate of laws from the New York University in July 1961.

Balewa&#x27;s portrait was placed on the 5 Naira Note. The Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University and the Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa Bauchi State International Airport in Bauchi was named in his honour.

==Personal life==
Balewa was described as modest and self-effacing. At his death, his major assets included his house in Bauchi and a 50-acre farm where he vacationed when he wanted to relax. The farm was located on the way to Tafawa Balewa village about nine miles outside Bauchi; many official decisions while in office were taken at the farm. Balewa was married to four women who bore him nineteen children.

Balewa was buried in Tafawa Balewa&#x27;s tomb at Bauchi.

<text>Sir Reginald Bray ( – 5 August 1503) was an English administrator and statesman. He was the Chancellor of the Duchy and County Palatine of Lancaster under Henry VII, briefly Treasurer of the Exchequer, and one of the most influential men in Henry VII&#x27;s government and administration. He was an estate officer and senior councillor to both Henry VII and the king&#x27;s mother, Margaret Beaufort. He was a major benefactor to St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor, where some of the building work for which he provided funds can still be seen and identified.

==Life before 1485==

Reginald (Reynold) Bray was born about 1440 in St. John Bedwardine parish, then outside of Worcester, the second son of Richard Bray, a surgeon. He was the eldest son born of his father&#x27;s second marriage to Joan Troughton. With his younger brother, John, Bray entered the service of Margaret Beaufort during the period of her first marriage to Sir Henry Stafford, acquitting himself sufficiently well to become the couple&#x27;s receiver-general by 1465. Margaret sent Bray several times on missions to her son by Edmund Tudor. For example, in 1469 he brought the young Henry Tudor a gift of money from his mother to enable the boy to purchase a bow and arrows. 

Bray continued in Margaret Beaufort&#x27;s service after Stafford&#x27;s death in 1471, and by 1485 had been her estate officer for more than twenty years, serving both Margaret and her successive husbands, Henry Stafford and Thomas, Lord Stanley. 

He had a leading role in the various conspiracies of 1483-1485 whose aim was to place Henry Tudor on the English throne. Bray would continue as Margaret Beaufort&#x27;s receiver-general until his own death in 1503.

==Career 1485-1503==
Bray was quickly established at the administrative and financial heart of the new regime. He enjoyed extraordinary and trusted access to the king whom he had first met as a boy. On 13 September 1485, Bray was appointed as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He retained the office for life. The office brought immense patronage and responsibilities, both judicial and financial, as well as prestige and profit to its holder. Bray was one of the seven men created a Knight of the Bath at the coronation of Henry VII. 

In the autumn and winter of 1485 he was employed doing one of the things he did best, raising money for the king. To this end, he acted jointly with the merchant Avery Cornburgh as under-treasurer of the Exchequer from mid-October 1485; and, on 28 February 1486, he replaced Archbishop Thomas Rotherham as Treasurer, serving until July 1486. He retained some fiscal responsibility until his own death in 1503. He was Treasurer of War for the king&#x27;s invasion of France in 1492. Peace with France brought him personal profit in the form of a pension from the King of France. 

In 1494, he was elected Steward of the University of Oxford, a position which carried judicial responsibilities. He was elevated to be a knight banneret after the battle of Blackheath in 1497. In 1501, he was elected as a Knight of the Garter. He was M.P. for Newcastle-under-Lyme in 1478, and for Hampshire in 1491, 1495, and 1497.

Neither Bray&#x27;s office of Chancellor of the Duchy, nor the various receiverships, stewardships, custodianship of castles, and the like, to which he was appointed by the king, fully explain his influence. He was above all the king&#x27;s councillor, one of many, but one of the most important. Under the king, from he led the development of the Council Learned, which met in the Duchy chamber at Westminster. His methods prefigured those of the notorious Empson and Dudley, although his authority and responsibilities were greater than both. As such, modern historiography casts him as one of Henry VII&#x27;s &#x27;new men&#x27;. The nineteenth century compared him to a Prime Minister. He was a known source of patronage and of intercession with the king. This spilled over into personal profit, whether such minor gifts as food and drink, or larger rewards of money and appointments to estate office and trusteeship by those seeking his favour. 

The nineteenth century classed Bray as an architect. It would be more accurate to call him a prodigious builder, both on his own behalf, and by funding and assisting friends and projects in which he took an interest. He built, for example, at his houses of Edgcote, which Henry VII briefly visited in 1498, and at Eaton, now known as Eaton Bray, in Bedfordshire. His presence among the donor portraits in the great &#x27;Magnificat&#x27; window at Great Malvern Priory suggests that he part funded the costs. He contributed to Jesus College in Cambridge and lent his assistance to Bishop Oliver King for building works at Bath Abbey. In January 1503 he helped to lay the foundation stone of the king&#x27;s new chapel in Westminster Abbey. The major beneficiary, however, was St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor, both during Bray&#x27;s life, and under the terms of his will.

==Personal life==
Bray married, about 1475, Katherine Hussey (d.1506), the younger of the two daughters and coheirs of Nicholas Hussey of Calais, by whom he had no issue. Katherine brought him lands in Harting, Sussex, and claims to lands in Berkshire and Hampshire. The bulk of Bray&#x27;s large estates, however, were acquired after 1485, some gained by exploiting his position and privilege.

Bray died without issue on 5 August 1503, and was buried in St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor. Bray had a brother of the whole blood, John Bray, and an elder half brother, also named John Bray. After litigation, Reginald Bray&#x27;s estates were divided between his nephew, Edmund Bray, eldest son of his brother of the whole blood, John Bray, and William Sandys, 1st Baron Sandys, who had married Margery Bray, the daughter of Bray&#x27;s elder brother of the half blood, John Bray.

==After-Life==
No tomb is extant for Bray, although a coffin said to be his was found in 1740. The extent of his financial contribution to the building works for the completion of the chapel first begun at Windsor by King Edward IV is, however, marked by repeated stone bosses and other decoration in stone, metal, and other materials. They display his coat of arms or his initials within the garter, and above all, his rebus of the hemp-brake or hemp-bray. The hemp-bray was a fairly crude implement used to separate the fibres of hemp from the tough outer coating of the dried stems of the plant, and was an effective pun on Bray&#x27;s name. By one count, one hundred and seventy five examples are found in the Chapel. A further ten such images, carved in wood, have recently been added by way of embellishments to the new furniture created by Treske of Thirsk for the Bray Chapel. In the twenty-first century Bray was again remembered and memorialised for his benefaction. As part of a fundraising effort for major works, the dean and canons established a &#x27;Bray Fellowship&#x27; with HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, as honorary senior fellow, recognising the contributions of ten major donors to the works. A Canadian Bray fellowship was also established, with similar aims. In 2017 the Royal Mail issued a commemorative set of postage stamps celebrating Windsor Castle and St George&#x27;s Chapel in which one of the quartet of stamps showing the Chapel was an illustration of a stone roof boss carved with Bray&#x27;s initials set within the garter.

<text>A pastie is a large to medium-sized battered deep-fried round of minced meat and vegetables common to Northern Ireland. Generally served with chips to form a &quot;pastie supper&quot; (&quot;supper&quot; in Northern Irish chip shops means something with chips), or in a white roll as a &quot;pastie bap&quot; or &quot;pastie burger&quot; it is a common staple in most fish and chip shops in the country.

Recipes vary, but the most common ingredients are minced pork, onion, potato and seasoning formed into a &quot;round&quot; (just like a burger), which is then covered in a batter mix and deep fried. Traditionally, chip shops coloured the pastie&#x27;s filling with a cochineal dye, giving it a bright pink colour, supposedly to make the snack more appetising. Many shops have stopped using this method due to cochineal allergies.

<text>The first USS &quot;Wampanoag&quot; was a screw frigate in the United States Navy built during the American Civil War.

==Development and design==
Commerce raiding by CSS &quot;Alabama&quot; and CSS &quot;Florida&quot;, both built in English yards, reached a point in 1863 where continued peaceful relations between the United States and Great Britain were seriously jeopardized. As a result, Congress responded by authorizing construction of a new class of screw frigates as part of the naval procurement bill of that year. These vessels, designed to be the fastest in the world, were intended for use in hit-and-run operations against British ports and commerce in the event of war. &quot;Wampanoag&quot; was the lead ship of this class, which also included the &quot;Madawaska&quot;.

&quot;Wampanoag&quot; contained numerous design features unprecedented in American naval construction. Her hull — designed by clipper ship architect Benjamin Franklin Delano — was unusually long and tapered relative to the vessel&#x27;s beam. Her machinery, developed by Naval Engineer Benjamin F. Isherwood, was unique for its geared steam engine in which slow-moving machinery coupled to fast-moving propulsion gear. Tremendous debate caused by this design delayed construction, preventing &quot;Wampanoag&quot; from being completed in time to serve in the American Civil War.

==Service history==
&quot;Wampanoag&quot; was laid down on 3 August 1863 by the New York Navy Yard; launched on 15 December 1864; sponsored by Miss Case, daughter of Capt. Augustus Ludlow Case, second-in-command of the navy yard; and commissioned on 17 September 1867, Capt. J. W. A. Nicholson in command.

===Sea trials===
The screw frigate finally left New York for sea trials on 7 February 1868. On 11 February, she commenced speed tests, running flat-out in rough weather from Barnegat Light, New Jersey, to Tybee Island, Georgia. She covered the distance of 633 nautical miles (1,172 km) in 38 hours for an average sustained speed of 16.6 knots (31 km/h), at one point making 17.75 knots (33 km/h). However, the validity of these trials have been called into question: all speeds were recorded out of sight of land, making their measurement less accurate, and may have been assisted by offshore currents. This record for a United States Navy vessel stood for 21 years until it was broken by , though achieved 18.6 knots on her trial a decade later. However, the wooden gear wheels used in the ship&#x27;s unique geared engine wore down by 5/8 of an inch during the first voyage alone.

===Deployment===
From 22 February 1868 to 8 April, &quot;Wampanoag&quot; was deployed as flagship of the North Atlantic Fleet. On 5 May 1868, she decommissioned at the New York Navy Yard. &quot;Wampanoag&quot; was renamed &quot;Florida&quot; on 15 May 1869.

===Condemnation===
The controversy generated by the frigate&#x27;s unconventional design reached a peak in 1869 when a naval commission examined and condemned the vessel. Rear Admiral Louis M. Goldsborough, Commodore Charles S. Boggs, and Engineers Edward D. Robie, John W. Moore, and Isaac Newton judged the ship unacceptable for active duty in the Navy. They complained of her unusually large machinery spaces and heavy coal consumption, and found particular fault with her narrow breadth relative to her length. The commission said this caused inordinate rolling and straining of the vessel. They calculated that of all the weight the hull could accommodate, 84% was taken up by engines, boilers and coal supplies, leaving only 16% for masts, sails, rigging, anchors, guns, provisions and water. &quot;Wampanoag&quot; also burned 136 tons of coal a day, enough for only five days of steaming: a serious handicap in a commerce raider which could be expected to spend most of its time chasing down enemy ships on the high seas. As a result, &quot;Florida&quot; remained in ordinary at New York for five years before departing on 5 March 1874, bound for New London, Connecticut, to become a receiving and store ship at the naval station there.

&quot;Florida&quot; remained at New London, rotting, until February 1885. She was sold, at New York, on 27 February 1885 to Edwin LeBars.

<doc id="674776" wikidata="Q813683" url="?curid=674776" title="Pelvic floor">
<text>The pelvic floor or pelvic diaphragm is an anatomical location in the human body, which has an important role in urinary and anal continence, sexual function and support of the pelvic organs. The pelvic floor includes muscles, both skeletal and smooth, ligaments and fascia. and separates between the pelvic cavity from above, and the perineum from below. It is formed by the levator ani muscle and coccygeus muscle, and associated connective tissue.

The pelvic floor has two hiatuses (gaps): (anteriorly) the urogenital hiatus through which urethra and vagina pass, and (posteriorly) the rectal hiatus through which the anal canal passes.

== Structure ==
=== Definition ===
Some sources do not consider &quot;pelvic floor&quot; and &quot;pelvic diaphragm&quot; to be identical, with the &quot;diaphragm&quot; consisting of only the levator ani and coccygeus, while the &quot;floor&quot; also includes the perineal membrane and deep perineal pouch. However, other sources include the fascia as part of the diaphragm. In practice, the two terms are often used interchangeably.

=== Relations ===
The pelvic cavity of the true pelvis has the pelvic floor as its inferior boundary (and the pelvic brim as its superior boundary). The perineum has the pelvic floor as its superior boundary.

Posteriorly, the pelvic floor extends into the anal triangle.

== Function ==
It is important in providing support for pelvic viscera (organs), e.g. the bladder, intestines, the uterus (in females), and in maintenance of as part of the urinary and anal sphincters. It facilitates birth by resisting the descent of the presenting part, causing the fetus to rotate forwards to navigate through the pelvic girdle. It helps maintain optimal intra-abdominal pressure.

==Clinical significance==
The pelvic floor is subject to clinically relevant changes that can result in:
* Anterior vaginal wall prolapse
** Cystocele (bladder into vagina)
** Urethrocele (urethra into vagina)
** Cystourethrocele (both bladder and urethra)
* Posterior vaginal wall prolapse
** Enterocele (small intestine into vagina)
** Rectocele (rectum into vagina)
* Apical vaginal prolapse
** Uterine prolapse (uterus into vagina)
** Vaginal vault prolapse (roof of vagina) - after hysterectomy

Pelvic floor dysfunction can result after treatment for gynecological cancers.

Damage to the pelvic floor not only contributes to urinary incontinence but can lead to pelvic organ prolapse. Pelvic organ prolapse occurs in women when pelvic organs (e.g. the vagina, bladder, rectum, or uterus) protrude into or outside of the vagina. The causes of pelvic organ prolapse are not unlike those that also contribute to urinary incontinence. These include inappropriate (asymmetrical, excessive, insufficient) muscle tone and asymmetries caused by trauma to the pelvis. Age, pregnancy, family history, and hormonal status all contribute to the development of pelvic organ prolapse. The vagina is suspended by attachments to the perineum, pelvic side wall and sacrum via attachments that include collagen, elastin, and smooth muscle. Surgery can be performed to repair pelvic floor muscles. The pelvic floor muscles can be strengthened with Kegel exercises. 

Disorders of the posterior pelvic floor include rectal prolapse, rectocele, perineal hernia, and a number of functional disorders including anismus. Constipation due to any of these disorders is called &quot;functional constipation&quot; and is identifiable by clinical diagnostic criteria.

Pelvic floor exercise (PFE), also known as Kegel exercises, may improve the tone and function of the pelvic floor muscles, which is of particular benefit for women (and less commonly men) who experience stress urinary incontinence. However, compliance with PFE programs often is poor, PFE generally is ineffective for urinary incontinence unless performed with biofeedback and trained supervision, and in severe cases it may have no benefit. Pelvic floor muscle tone may be estimated using a perineometer, which measures the pressure within the vagina. Medication may also be used to improve continence. In severe cases, surgery may be used to repair or even to reconstruct the pelvic floor. One surgery which interrupts pelvic floor musculature in males is a radical prostatectomy. With the removal of the prostate, many males experience urinary incontinence post operation; pelvic floor exercises may be used to counteract this pre and post operation. Pre-operative pelvic floor exercising significantly decreases the prevalence of urinary incontinence post radical prostatectomy. Prostatitis and prostatectomies are two contributors to erectile dysfunction; following a radical prostatectomy studies show that erectile dysfunction is improved by pelvic floor muscle training under the supervision of physical therapists certified in pelvic floor rehabilitation .

Perineology or pelviperineology is a specialty dealing with the functional troubles of the three axes (urological, gynecological and coloproctological) of the pelvic floor.

<text>Sir Edward Codrington, (27 April 1770 – 28 April 1851) was a British admiral, who took part in the Battle of Trafalgar and the Battle of Navarino.

==Early life and career==
The youngest of three brothers born to Edward Codrington the elder (1732–1775) and Rebecca Lestourgeon (Sturgeon) (1736–1770), Codrington came from a long military tradition. His father was the youngest son of Sir William Codrington, 1st Baronet. Their aristocratic, landowning family, was descended from John Codrington, reputed to be standard-bearer to Henry V at Agincourt, and related to the Codrington baronets, Codrington was educated by an uncle named Mr Bethell. He was sent for a short time to Harrow, and entered the Royal Navy in July 1783. He served off the Eastern Seaboard of the United States, in the Mediterranean and in home waters, until he was promoted to lieutenant on 28 May 1793, when Lord Howe selected him to be signal lieutenant on the flagship of the Channel fleet at the beginning of the French Revolutionary Wars. In that capacity he served on the 100-gun during the operations which culminated in the battle of the Glorious First of June.

As a reward for his actions at the battle, on 7 October 1794 he was promoted to commander, and on 6 April 1795 attained the rank of Post-Captain and the command of the 22-gun from which he observed the Battle of Groix on 23 June 1795. His next command, from July 1796 to March 1797, was the frigate whom he commanded in the Channel and off the coast of Portugal. On 7 January 1797, &quot;Druid&quot;, along with and captured the French frigate &quot;Ville de L&#x27;Orient&quot;, armed en flûte and carrying 400 hussars to join the rebels in Ireland.

Following this, Codrington spent a period largely on land and on half-pay for some years. In December 1802, he married Jane Hall, an English woman from Kingston, Jamaica (with whom he had 3 sons and 3 daughters), and remained without a ship until the Peace of Amiens came to a close in 1803.

In 1797, Edward Codrington, his brother William John, and his sister Caroline, jointly inherited their uncle Christopher Bethell&#x27;s residuary estates, including a slave plantation in Antigua.

His eldest brother Christopher Bethell Codrington inherited their uncles main estates and Dodington park, which was later rebuilt by James Wyatt between 1798 and 1816.

==Service in the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812==
On the renewal of hostilities with France he remained in frigates for some time before being given the ship of the line in the spring of 1805 which was attached to Admiral Nelson&#x27;s fleet off Cadiz in the blockade of the combined fleet. Codrington and &quot;Orion&quot; were engaged at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805, where &quot;Orion&quot; was stationed to the rear of the northern division and therefore took two hours to reach battle. Once there, Codrington ignored all other ships and focused entirely on closing with a hitherto unengaged French ship, the , forcing her to surrender. He then attacked but failed to capture the Spanish flagship before moving on to the , the only ship of the northern division to return. &quot;Orion&quot;, with other ships, dismasted and then sailed round her, firing continually until she surrendered.

For the next several years, Codrington fought alongside the Spanish against the French in the Mediterranean Sea, commanding a squadron that harried French shipping and made numerous coastal raids. During this time also participated in the disastrous Walcheren expedition in 1809.

The two months of May and June in 1811 were to prove his most testing time while stationed on Spain&#x27;s eastern seaboard. He went to great lengths to help the Spanish besieged at Tarragona by the French Army of Aragon under Louis Gabriel Suchet. Convinced that the Marquis de Campoverde, the Spanish general in charge of Tarragona, was not up to the task, Codrington, who had a clearer understanding of the situation, helped the British military agent Charles William Doyle to contrive a plan of succour. Through his own personal efforts Codrington brought to Tarragona 6,300 Spanish infantry and 291 artillerymen as reinforcements. He spent many nights in the port area guiding cannon launches against the enemy. When the city fell, he rescued over 600 people from the beach in a Dunkirk-style operation under fire from enemy cannon and personally undertook to reunite mothers and babies who had been separated during the evacuation. Afterwards, he intervened on a political level to stop Captain General de Lacy disarming the local Catalan Somaténs (militias).

Codrington was promoted to the rank of Rear-Admiral of the Blue on 4 June 1814, while he was serving off the coast of North America as captain of the fleet to Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane during the operations against Washington, Baltimore and New Orleans during the War of 1812. In recognition of this service, he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1815. He became a Rear-Admiral of the Red on 12 August 1819, and then a vice admiral on 10 July 1821. He was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in February 1822.

==Greek War of Independence and the Battle of Navarino==
In December 1826 Codrington was appointed Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet and sailed on 1 February 1827. From that date until his recall on 21 June 1828 he was engaged in the arduous duties imposed on him by the Greek War of Independence, which had led to anarchy in occupied Greece and surrounding areas. His orders were to enforce a peaceful solution on the situation in Greece, but Codrington was not known for his diplomacy, and on 20 October 1827 he destroyed the Turkish and Egyptian fleet at the Battle of Navarino while in command of a combined British, French and Russian fleet.

After the battle Codrington went to Malta to refit his ships. He remained there till May 1828, when he sailed to join his French and Russian colleagues on the coast of the Morea. They endeavoured to enforce the evacuation of the peninsula by Ibrahim Pasha peacefully. The Pasha made diplomatic difficulties, which came in the form of continuous genocide against the Greeks of Morea who were to be replaced with Muslims from Africa, and on 25 July the three admirals agreed that Codrington should go to Alexandria to obtain Ibrahim&#x27;s recall by his father Mehemet Ali. Codrington had heard on 22 June of his own supersession, but, as his successor had not arrived, he carried out the arrangement made on 25 July, and his presence at Alexandria led to the treaty of 6 August 1828, by which the evacuation of the Morea was settled. His services were recognised by the grant of the Grand Cross of the Bath, but there is no doubt that the British government was embarrassed by his heavy-handed gunboat diplomacy and not too impressed by the further weakening of Russia&#x27;s main opponent, the Ottomans.

==Later years==
After his return home, Codrington spent some time in defending himself, and then in leisure abroad. He commanded a training squadron in the Channel in 1831 and became a full admiral on 10 January 1837. He was elected member of parliament for Devonport in 1832, and sat for that constituency until he accepted the Chiltern Hundreds in 1839. From November 1839 to December 1842 he was Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth.

On 5 October 1835, under the terms of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, Codrington was awarded government compensation of £2,588 6s 6d for the 190 slaves he had owned at the Rooms plantation on Antigua, and who had been freed under the terms of the act.

Codrington died in London on 28 April 1851. He left two sons, both of whom achieved distinction in the British armed forces. Sir William Codrington (1804–1884) was a commander in the Crimean War. Sir Henry Codrington (1808–1877), a naval officer, became an Admiral of the Fleet. A third son, Edward Codrington, was a midshipman aboard when he died sometime in 1821 or 1822 in the Mediterranean. He had been taking a cutter to Hydra when a squall overturned the boat, drowning him, a merchant, and three crewmen.

Codrington was buried in St Peter&#x27;s Church, Eaton Square, but in 1954 the remains were reburied at Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey, plot number 70. Plaques to his memory can be found in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and All Saints Church, Dodington, close to the family home, and there is a large obelisk dedicated to the memory of him and the other officers at Navarino at Pylos in Greece.

Numerous roads are named after him in Greece and stamps with his figure have been issued. At least three pubs; one in south-west London and two now-closed pubs in Coventry and south-east London are named after him.

In June 2020, a plaque in Brighton commemorating Codrington was removed following protest over the commemoration of a slave owner as part of the George Floyd protests.

<doc id="674787" wikidata="Q277720" url="?curid=674787" title="In medias res">
<text>A narrative work beginning in medias res (, &quot;into the middle of things&quot;) opens in the chronological middle of the plot, rather than at the beginning (cf. &quot;ab ovo&quot;, &quot;ab initio&quot;). Often, exposition is initially bypassed, instead filled in gradually through dialogue, flashbacks, or description of past events. For example, &quot;Hamlet&quot; begins after the death of Hamlet&#x27;s father, which is later discovered to have been a murder. Characters make reference to King Hamlet&#x27;s death without the plot&#x27;s first establishment of this fact. Since the play is about Hamlet and the revenge more so than the motivation, Shakespeare uses &quot;in medias res&quot; to bypass superfluous exposition.

Works that employ &quot;in medias res&quot; often later use flashback and nonlinear narrative for exposition to fill in the backstory. In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, the reader first learns about Odysseus&#x27;s journey when he is held captive on Calypso&#x27;s island. The reader then finds out, in Books IX through XII, that the greater part of Odysseus&#x27;s journey precedes that moment in the narrative. In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; there are fewer flashbacks, although it opens in the thick of the Trojan War.

== First use of the phrase ==
The Roman lyric poet and satirist Horace (65–8 BC) first used the terms ab ōvō (&quot;from the egg&quot;) and in mediās rēs (&quot;into the middle of things&quot;) in his &quot;Ars Poetica&quot; (&quot;Poetic Arts&quot;, c. 13 BC), wherein lines 147–149 describe the ideal epic poet:
The word &quot;egg&quot; reference is to the mythological origin of the Trojan War in the birth of Helen and Clytemnestra from the double egg laid by Leda following her seduction by Zeus in the guise of a swan. Compare the &quot;Iliad&quot;, which begins nine years after the start of the Trojan War, rather than at its beginning.

== Literary history ==
With likely origins in oral tradition, the narrative technique of beginning a story &quot;in medias res&quot; is a stylistic convention of epic poetry, the exemplars in Western literature being the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot; (both 7th century BC), by Homer. Likewise, the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; (c. 8th century BC – c. 4th century AD) opens &quot;in medias res&quot;.

The classical-era poet Virgil (Publius Vergilius Maro, 70–19 BC) continued this literary narrative technique in the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, which is part of the Roman literary tradition of imitating Homer. Later works starting &quot;in medias res&quot; include the story &quot;The Three Apples&quot; from the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; (c. 9th century), the Italian &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; (1320) by Dante Alighieri, the German &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; (12th century), the Spanish &quot;Cantar de Mio Cid&quot; (c. 14th century), the Portuguese &quot;The Lusiads&quot; (1572) by Luís de Camões, &quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot; (1581) by Torquato Tasso, &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (1667) by John Milton, and generally in Modernist literature.

Modern novelists using &quot;in medias res&quot; with flashbacks include William Faulkner and Toni Morrison.

Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot; is written &quot;in medias res&quot;.

== Cinematic history ==
It is typical for film noir to begin &quot;in medias res&quot;; for example, a private detective will enter the plot already in progress. &quot;Crossfire&quot; (1947) opens with the murder of Joseph Samuels. As the police investigate the crime, the story behind the murder is told via flashbacks. &quot;Dead Reckoning&quot; (1947) opens with Humphrey Bogart as Rip Murdock on the run and attempting to hide in a Catholic church. Inside, the backstory is told in flashback as Murdock explains his situation to a priest.

The technique has been used across genres, including dramas such as &quot;Through a Glass Darkly&quot; (1961), &quot;8½&quot; (1963), &quot;Raging Bull&quot; (1980), and &quot;City of God&quot; (2002); crime thrillers such as &quot;No Way Out&quot; (1987), &quot;Grievous Bodily Harm&quot; (1988), &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; (1995), and &quot;Kill Bill Volume 2&quot; (2004); horror films such as &quot;Firestarter&quot; (1984); action films such as many in the James Bond franchise; and comedies such as &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; (1964). Some have argued that &quot;Star Wars&quot; takes advantage of this technique because its first-released film, &quot;A New Hope&quot;, is the fourth episode of a nine-part epic.

Superhero films with a satirical edge such as &quot;Deadpool&quot; (2016) and &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; (2020) have utilized &quot;in medias res&quot; to frame their stories.

Animated films such as &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; (1988), &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot; (2000), &quot;Hoodwinked!&quot; (2005), &quot;Happily N&#x27;Ever After&quot; (2006), &quot;Megamind&quot; (2010), and &quot;The Mitchells vs. the Machines&quot; (2021) have opening scenes &quot;in medias res&quot;, with a brief but significant scene that foreshadows the events that occurred earlier. This scene is then seen again afterwards (although in a different way than how it was shown at the beginning).

Many war films, such as &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; (1998), also begin &quot;in medias res&quot;, with the protagonists already actively in combat and no prior domestic scenes leading up to the film&#x27;s events.

<text>Curtis James Weston (born 24 January 1987) is an English professional footballer who plays for club Mickleover.

==Playing career==
Born in Greenwich, London, Weston attended Erith Secondary School, and was spotted by a Millwall scout when playing for the school team and subsequently joined Millwall&#x27;s youth academy. In only his second appearance for Millwall&#x27;s first team, he replaced player-manager Dennis Wise in the 89th minute of the 2004 FA Cup Final against Manchester United to become the youngest FA Cup finalist at the age of 17 years 119 days, beating the 125-year-old record of James F. M. Prinsep. He said &quot;it&#x27;s obviously the highlight of my career so far. I supported Manchester United as a kid so that made it even more special. I didn&#x27;t get long on the pitch, but I got a few touches. I remember a sliding tackle on Ruud van Nistelrooy, and a 50–50 with Nicky Butt. I kept my shirt, and I also got Mikaël Silvestre&#x27;s&quot;.

Weston moved to Swindon Town in July 2006 when Dennis Wise, now managing Swindon, signed him again. Weston finally managed a run of appearances and scored his first professional goal in a game against Bristol Rovers. He was released by Swindon a year later. Weston signed a two-year contract with Leeds United on 7 August 2007, the third time that Dennis Wise gave him a contract.
 He scored his first goal for the club in their 3–0 win over Northampton Town in January 2008, but his time with Leeds was not long. &quot;Gary McAllister (the new Leeds manager after Wise left for Newcastle United), was straight with me. He just told me I wasn&#x27;t in his plans and I should get myself another club,&quot; said Weston later.

Weston signed for Football League Championship team Scunthorpe United on loan, in March 2008. In August 2008, Weston joined Gillingham, initially on a one-month loan, before signing a two-year contract. He said &quot;when the chance came to go to Gillingham I grabbed it. ..being from the area, I knew the club, knew the set-up was good. It was the chance to move back to where my family is, and to play regular games&quot;. He made his Gillingham debut away to AFC Bournemouth on 9 August 2008, and scored his first goal for the club on 28 December 2008 against Wycombe Wanderers.

Weston signed for Barnet on 13 August 2012, but saw a lack of first team action at first due to the arrival of John Oster and Edgar Davids soon afterwards. He played a prevalent role however, in Barnet&#x27;s last fixtures of the season, starting their last game at Underhill, with his shot from outside the box hitting the post. He started the final game of the season against Northampton Town, which Barnet went on to lose 2–0, thus relegating them to the Conference. Weston spent six seasons with the Bees, during which time he held the captaincy and won the Conference Premier title in 2014–15. On 24 May 2018, it was confirmed that Weston had agreed to join Chesterfield for the 2018–19 season. In four seasons, he scored nine goals in 161 appearances for the Spireites. Weston joined AFC Fylde for the 2022–23 season. In summer 2023 he signed for Buxton.

In July 2024, Weston joined Northern Premier League Premier Division side Mickleover.

<doc id="674790" wikidata="Q275550" url="?curid=674790" title="Killers (Iron Maiden album)">
<text>Killers is the second studio album by English heavy metal band Iron Maiden. It was first released on 2 February 1981 in the United Kingdom by EMI Records and on 11 May in the United States by Harvest and Capitol Records. The album was their first with guitarist Adrian Smith, and their last with vocalist Paul Di&#x27;Anno, who was fired after problems with his stage performances arose due to his alcohol and cocaine use. &quot;Killers&quot; was also the first Iron Maiden album recorded with producer Martin Birch, who went on to produce their next eight albums until &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot; (1992).

==Background==
&quot;Killers&quot; is the only Iron Maiden album to feature two instrumentals. It was written almost exclusively by Steve Harris; only &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; and the title track are cowritten.

Except for &quot;Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot; (based on the story of the same name by Edgar Allan Poe) and &quot;Prodigal Son&quot;, the songs were written in the years prior to the recording of their debut album. Five of the album&#x27;s songs featured in the band&#x27;s live setlists in 1977, when Dennis Wilcock fronted Iron Maiden. &quot;Wrathchild&quot; and &quot;Strange World&quot; appear to be written as far back as 1976 and original singer Paul Mario Day later claimed he had co-written &quot;Strange World&quot;. No songs were recorded professionally until the &quot;Killers&quot; sessions, with the exception of &quot;Wrathchild&quot; (a version recorded in 1979 was featured on the &quot;Metal for Muthas&quot; compilation).

&quot;The Ides of March&quot; is nearly identical to &quot;Thunderburst&quot;, by fellow British NWOBHM band Samson, who featured a pre-Maiden Bruce Dickinson on vocals; however, &quot;The Ides of March&quot; was written during the brief time in 1977 in which future Samson drummer Thunderstick was a member of Iron Maiden. While Harris took sole credit for &quot;The Ides of March&quot;, &quot;Thunderburst&quot; is credited to Harris and all four members of Samson&#x27;s &quot;Head On&quot; line-up, Bruce Bruce, aka Bruce Dickinson, Chris Aylmer, Paul Samson, and Thunderstick, aka Barry Purkis.

&quot;Killers&quot; spent eight weeks on the UK chart. The North American edition, which came out a few months later, was initially released on Harvest Records/Capitol Records and subsequently on Sanctuary Records/Columbia Records. The song &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; was added to the album. In Australia, the Skyhooks cover &quot;Women in Uniform&quot; was added instead as a bonus track.

The Killer World Tour featured the band&#x27;s first US shows, beginning at The Aladdin, Las Vegas, in support of Judas Priest. Subsequently, &quot;Wrathchild&quot; is the only regularly played track from the album, appearing in almost all their tours.

==Track listing==



==Covers==
The song &quot;Wrathchild&quot; was covered in 2003 by the English metal band Sikth and featured as a B-side on their single &quot;Scent of the Obscene&quot;. The song was also covered in 2005 by female tribute band The Iron Maidens on their 2007 album &quot;Route 666&quot;, by Gallows on the 2008 tribute CD &quot;Maiden Heaven: A Tribute to Iron Maiden&quot; released by &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine, and by Six Feet Under on the reissue of their 1999 album &quot;Maximum Violence&quot;. &quot;Wrathchild&quot; was featured in the PlayStation 2 game &quot;Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s&quot;.

<doc id="674795" wikidata="Q1072284" url="?curid=674795" title="Huis ten Bosch">
<text>Huis ten Bosch (, ; ) is a royal palace in The Hague, Netherlands. It is one of three official residences of the Dutch monarch; the two others being the Noordeinde Palace in The Hague and the Royal Palace of Amsterdam.

Huis ten Bosch was the home of Queen Beatrix from 1981 to her abdication in 2013; King Willem-Alexander and his family moved in on 13 January 2019. A replica of the palace was built in Sasebo, Japan, in a theme park bearing the same name.

==History==
===17th and 18th century===
Construction of Huis ten Bosch began on 2 September 1645, under the direction of Bartholomeus Drijffhout, and to a design by Pieter Post and Jacob van Campen. It was commissioned by Amalia of Solms-Braunfels, the wife of Stadtholder Frederick Henry, on a parcel of land granted to her by the States General. The first stone was laid by Elizabeth of Bohemia.

After her husband&#x27;s death in 1647, Amalia dedicated the palace to him. Led by the architect-painters Jacob van Campen and Pieter Post, other major artists of the day, such as Gerard van Honthorst, Jacob Jordaens, Thomas Willeboirts Bosschaert, Theodoor van Thulden, Caesar van Everdingen, Salomon de Bray, Pieter Soutman, Gonzales Coques, Pieter de Grebber, Adriaen Hanneman, Pieter Hermansz Verelst and Jan Lievens, filled the Oranjezaal (&quot;Orange Hall&quot; ) with paintings glorifying the late prince. Between 1734 and 1737 the architect Daniel Marot added two wings to the palace, including a new dining room.

Over the next century and a half, the palace would change possession from the Nassau family, the king of Prussia, and many stadtholders until the Batavian Revolution in 1795. The government of the newly created Batavian Republic gave the palace to the Batavian (Dutch) people who still own it to this day.

===19th and 20th century===

The National Art Gallery, predecessor of the Rijksmuseum, was housed in the building from 1800 to 1805. Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s brother, Louis, king of Holland, briefly lived in the palace between 1805 and 1807.

When William Frederick, Prince of Orange-Nassau, the only surviving son of the last stadtholder, was proclaimed king of the Netherlands as William I in 1815, he made Huis ten Bosch Palace one of his official residences. It became a favourite location for many members of the royal family. In 1899 the palace was the site of several meetings of the First International Peace Conference at The Hague. During World War I it became the primary residence of Queen Wilhelmina.

Queen Wilhelmina and her family were forced to evacuate the palace for Britain (from which the Queen&#x27;s family, but not the Queen herself, would move on to Canada) when the German army invaded the Netherlands during World War II. The Nazi administration planned to demolish the palace, but the controller convinced them otherwise. However, the palace was damaged beyond habitation.

Between 1950 and 1956, the palace was restored and once again became a royal residence. It became the prime residence once more in 1981.

The palace has undergone major reconstructions since it was built. Currently, it consists of a central part with two long wings, spanning approximately 110 meters from end to end.

<doc id="674796" wikidata="Q962591" url="?curid=674796" title="JFE Holdings">
<text>is a corporation headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. It was formed in 2002 by the merger of and and owns JFE Steel, JFE Engineering and Japan Marine United. JFE is from Japan, Fe (the chemical element symbol of iron) and Engineering. In 2020, it was ranked 365th in Fortune Global 500 List.

==Mergers and Spinoffs==
At the time JFE Holdings was created in 2002, NKK Corporation was Japan&#x27;s second largest steelmaker and Kawasaki Steel was the third largest steelmaker.
Both companies were major military vessel manufacturers during World War II.

JFE&#x27;s main business is steel production. It also engages in engineering, ship building, real-estate redevelopment, and LSi business. The company also operates several overseas subsidiaries, including California Steel Industries in the United States, Fujian Sino-Japan Metal in China, and Minas da Serra Geral in Brazil. Other than steel, they are also known for products such as the bicycle tree.

JFE Holdings owns JFE Steel, the fifth largest steel maker in the world with revenue in excess of US$30 billion. JFE Holdings has other subsidiaries including JFE Engineering, JFE Steel and JFE Shoji, and part-owns Japan Marine United, a major shipbuilding company.

NKK and Siderca S.A. of Argentina established a seamless pipe joint venture by spinning off the seamless pipe division of NKK&#x27;s Keihin Works in 2000. In November 2009, JFE agreed to partner with JSW Steel, India&#x27;s third-largest steel producer, to construct a joint steel plant in West Bengal. In July 2010, JFE acquired a 14.9% stake in India&#x27;s JSW Steel Ltd.

Its shipbuilding unit, Universal Shipbuilding was created in 2002 when NKK Corporation a predecessor of JFE, merged its shipbuilding unit with that of Hitachi Zosen. In 2012, JFE merged its ship building unit, Universal Shipbuilding Corporation, with Marine United Inc. of IHI after discussion started in April 2008 to form Japan Marine United Corporation It aimed to become Japan&#x27;s largest shipbuilder. However, on January 1, 2021, JMU (with 49% of shares) merged into a new joint venture with Imabari Shipbuilding (with 51% of shares) named Nihon Shipyard and covering all ship types except LNG tankers. In parallel, Imabari Shipbuilding bought 30% of JMU&#x27;s shares. The cooperation between Imabari Shipbuilding and JMU make it one of the largest marine engineering and shipbuilding company in the world.

===Super-rapid charging===
JFE Engineering Corporation is developing a quick charging station that it claims can take a battery from zero charge to 50% full in about 3 minutes. It has two batteries, one that stores electrical energy from the grid and another that delivers it to the car at extremely high current (500-600 ampere), which allows it to use a low voltage power supply. The company claims that even though one station costs about $63,000, that&#x27;s roughly 40% less than the competing CHAdeMO system.

===Bicycle Tree===
The bicycle tree is an automatic storage system for bicycles that can hold up to 6,000 bikes. The systems works by fitting the bicycle with an electronic tag and a computer saves the owner&#x27;s data. Then a mechanical arm pulls the bike into a cylindrical well and stores it in a free location. When the owner wants to retrieve the bike, a card is swiped through a reader and the computer retrieves the bike based on the data.

==Carbon footprint==
JFE Holdings, Inc. reported Total CO2e emissions (Direct + Indirect) for the twelve months ending 31 March 2019 at 60,500 Kt (+600/+1% y-o-y). There have been no significant reductions in recent years.

The desert is a large lava field originating from eruptions of Trölladyngja and other shield volcanoes in the area. Herðubreið was formed beneath the ice sheet that covered Iceland during the last glacial period.

==Overview==
This distinctive mountain has been known by its present name since at least 1300. Due to the mountain&#x27;s steep and unstable sides, the first definite ascent was in 1908 by Hans Reck and Sigurður Sumarliðason, despite centuries of knowledge of its existence. 
The mountain is often referred to as &quot;The Queen of Icelandic Mountains&quot; by Icelanders due to its beautiful shape. It was voted in 2002 &quot;Iceland’s favourite mountain&quot;.

Near the mountain lies an oasis called Herðubreiðarlindir with a campground and hiking trails. In former times, outcasts who had been excluded from Icelandic society because of crimes they had committed lived in the Ódáðahraun and accessed the oasis. One such outlaw was Fjalla-Eyvindur, who lived there during the winter of 1774–1775.

In 2019, Herðubreið became a part of Vatnajökull National Park.

== Geology ==
Herðubreið is a basaltic central subglacial volcano that formed during the last ice age under ice at least as thick as its current prominence of about . It is usually described as a composite volcano which is the same as a stratovolcano. It is separate from the present potentially active fissure swarms and central volcanoes nearby and is believed to be inactive. Its original magma reservoirs are believed to have been at , and below the surface. There is in the upper crust, between deep, a broad belt of shallow seismicity extending from to the south of Herðubreið to the mountain itself due to plate boundary spreading. There is also deeper activity likely to be related to magmatic movements but perhaps this is related to the shallow volcano-tectonic seismic activity at the active Askja volcano nearby. Herðubreið is a classic tuya and was quickly recognised as such after the landform was described firstly as a subglacial volcanic construct in 1947.

The eruption sequence likely started before the glaciation of the last ice age south of Herðubreið in the ridge area called Herdubreidartögl with olivine tholeiite basalt being erupted. Glaciation resulted in pressure on the magma reservoir that initially may have switched off further eruptive activity. In due course a second stage in the southern part of Herðubreið melted the ice with initial olivine tholeiite lava deposition under a lake that was followed by underwater hyaloclastite mass flow deposits. This stage was not as confined by ice as the next stage and has evidence of a subaerial lava sheet, and had only moderately steep ice walls below this. As the ice sheet thickened further towards the glacial maximum of 12–15,000 years ago hyaloclastite, then pillow lavas under steep-sided hyaloclastite occurred. These built up until Herðubreið emerged above the lake surface, from a lake with almost vertical confining ice walls many about tall. If as happened in Herðubreið&#x27;s case the eruption in its last stage became again sub-aerial with a lava cap and a spatter cone or crater vent. 

Accordingly the southern portion of the plateau at the top of Herðubreiðar has a deep crater, which can contain a lake in summer. While by the end of glaciation, Herðubreiðar was extinct, volcanic activity resumed for a time at Herdubreidartögl to its south with fallout deposits and olivine tholeiitic lava flows in a much more spread out fashion.

<text>Kverkfjöll () is a potentially active central volcano, fissure swarm, and associated mountain range situated on the northern border of the glacier Vatnajökull in Iceland.

It is located in Vatnajökull National Park and at the glacier edge are ice caves and some geothermal features.

The main volume of the Jökulsá á Fjöllum river flows from the Kverkfjöll area. The Volga River directly drains the Kverkjökull glacier into the Jökulsá á Fjöllum. These river systems have had significant jökulhlaups during the Holocene that are related to the three active volcanic systems of Bárðarbunga, Grímsvötn and Kverkfjöll but assignment has been difficult to individual volcanic systems.

== Geography ==
The maximum elevation of the central volcano at the peak of Skarphéðinstindur is . The central volcano is mainly situated under Kverkjökull, an outlet glacier of Vatnajökull. The Kverkjökull icecap to the north-west of Skarphéðinstindur, has a maximum elevation of . To the west of Kverkjökull is the Dyngjujökull outlet glacier and to its east is the Skarphéðinsjökull adjacent to the Brúarjökull outlet glaciers of Vatnajökull. To the north of the central volcano there is a fissure swarm striking N20-30°E for and to the south of the central volcano it is possible that a subglacial fissure swarm extends for .

The area north of Kverkfjöll has been altered by large floods originating from the northern part of Vatnajökull with the heights being tindars and hyaloclastite ridges orientated towards the nor-north-east. The Holocene active volcanic fissures are mostly confined to the nor-north-east orientated Kverkfjöll fissure swarm (Kverkfjallarani western ridge), rather than the north-east orientated Kverkárnes fissure swarm (Kverkhnjúkar eastern ridge). The 2014 to 2015 erupted Holuhraun lava field is approximately to the north-west of Kverkfjöll but is related to the adjacent Bárðarbunga volcanic system.

== Geology ==
While the dominant magma is tholeiite basalt, samples of some rocks carried in the Kverkjökull glacier have been silicic and presumably originate from the central volcano, which is a stratovolcano. There is a geothermal field just beyond the western rim of the northern most caldera. This has created ice–dammed lakes called Gengissig and Galtarlón. They are drained by the thermal Volga river. Beyond the eastern rim of the northern caldera is another thermal river, the Hveragil that drains geothermal areas along the eastern northern caldera margin. The oldest identified rocks are 780,000 years old.

The tectonic context is that the Kverkfjöll volcanic system is part of the divergent plate boundary northern volcanic zone of Iceland slightly to the north-east of the central volcanoes of the Grímsvötn and Bárdarbunga that are inferred to be closer to the Iceland mantle plume. The mantle is at about depth under Kverkfjöll, with lower crustal magma intrusion to pockets that are about deep, and its hydrothermal system being driven by a magma intrusion pocket about deep with the hydrothermal water reservoir being at about deep.

=== Activity ===
Tephra studies have identified up to seventy eruptions in the last 6500 years, but the volcano has been in relative repose in the last thousand years and had also been inactive for a period between 3000 and 4000 years ago. Tholeiite basalt tephra from the volcano has been found to the west from eruptions dated 5850 ± 200 and 10630 ± 150 . An earthquake swarm in 2007 to 2008 near Mount Upptyppingar, which is north-east of the Kverkfjöll central volcano was interpreted as a dyke intrusion. The most recent volcanic subaerial eruption occurred about 1300 years ago from the northern fissure swarm and produced a lava flow covering about . In 2013 a jökulhlaup occurred that emptied the water-filled Gengissig depression hydrothermal area, that is located just north-west to the northern caldera. Further than the flood, due to the release of water pressure, there were subsequent significant hydrothermal explosions in the lake bed. Similar water floods or eruptions may have occurred since the since the mid-17th century. A hydrothermal eruption occurred in 1968, to the west of the Gengissig depression, and jökulhlaups from the Gengissig depression occurred in 2002, 1997, 1993, 1987 and 1985. Other low grade, possibly hydrothermal, eruptions assigned to the system, have occurred in 1968, 1959, 1929, 1729 (two), and 1655. At least two very large pre-history Holocene jökulhlaups that have had subsequent lava flows over them could have been generated by Kverkfjöll. Before this a tephra layer called the Fugloyarbanki tephra from 27,000 years ago came from Kverkfjöll.

<doc id="674810" wikidata="Q586260" url="?curid=674810" title="Sojitz">
<text>is a &quot;sogo shosha&quot; (general trading company) based in Tokyo, Japan. It is engaged in a wide range of businesses globally, including buying, selling, importing, and exporting goods, manufacturing and selling products, providing services, and planning and coordinating projects, in Japan and overseas. Sojitz also invests in various sectors and conducts financing activities. The broad range of sectors in which Sojitz operates includes automobiles, energy, mineral resources, chemicals, foodstuff resources, agricultural and forestry resources, consumer goods, and industrial parks.

Sojitz was formed in 2004 by the merger of and . The name &quot;Sojitz&quot; is derived from the names of Nissho Iwai and Nichimen, both of which include the character &quot;日&quot; (sun). &quot;Sojitz&quot;, literally meaning &quot;twin suns&quot;, implies a merger of equals between the two companies. The corporate logo is a stylized version of the first character in its Japanese name.

==History==

===Nichimen===

Beginning around 1878, the Japanese government promoted the development of cotton spinning as an initial means of developing modern industry in Japan in the wake of the Meiji Restoration. Japan&#x27;s native raw cotton supply proved inadequate to meet demand, and there was only one Japanese importer of raw cotton at the time, making the industry highly reliant on foreign merchants. To improve this situation, a group of spinning companies established in Osaka in 1892 under the leadership of Tsuneki Sano, a 38-year-old former government official.

After the Russo-Japanese War, Nichimen expanded its business from importing. The company began cotton spinning operations in the Kwantung Leased Territory and established offices in China, Korea, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom to supply local markets. In 1910, Nichimen opened a subsidiary in Fort Worth, Texas to enter the raw cotton trade in the United States. World War I strained cotton supply in Europe, boosting Nichimen&#x27;s international business further. In the late 1910s the company expanded into South America and Africa, trading in cotton as well as wool, food products, and machinery.

The Great Depression harmed Nichimen&#x27;s cotton business, spurring the company&#x27;s diversification beyond cotton to trade in silk, rayon and other materials. During World War II, Nichimen was tapped by the Japanese military to manage production of flour, matches and starch. The company changed its name to Nichimen Enterprise (Nichimen Jitsugyo) in 1943 to reflect its more diverse business.

The largest &quot;zaibatsu&quot; trading companies were dismantled after the war, giving Nichimen an early lead among the &quot;sogo shosha&quot; in the 1950s and a six percent share of Japanese foreign trade by 1958. Nichimen became closely affiliated with Osaka-based Sanwa Bank in 1955, which financed all of Nichimen&#x27;s domestic business. Nichimen was not the main trading company for the Sanwa &quot;keiretsu&quot; as that position was already held by Iwai &amp; Co. Nichimen Jitsugyo.
By 1970, Nichimen was trading in steel, electronics, motor vehicles and fibers in addition to textiles. Nichimen served as the joint venture partner for Nabisco when it began operations in Japan in the 1970s. Nichimen Co., Ltd. changed its name to Nichimen Corporation in 1982. Nichimen, like other &quot;sogo shosha&quot;, was hit hard by the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble in the early 1990s, and subsequently made a strategic shift from the &quot;soft&quot; businesses of lumber, food, and chemicals trading to the &quot;hard&quot; businesses of machinery, steel, and construction.

===Nissho Iwai===
Nissho Iwai was formed in 1968 by the merger of Nissho Company and Iwai Sangyo Company.

Nissho Company was founded in Kobe in 1902 as Suzuki &amp; Company (:ja:鈴木商店) under the leadership of Naokichi Kaneko (:ja:金子直吉) when died this company&#x27;s predecessor shop&#x27;s founder, Iwajiro Suzuki (:ja:鈴木岩治郎) (1837–1894). Suzuki was originally a sugar trading firm but later diversified into flour, steel, tobacco, beer, insurance, shipping and shipbuilding; it became the second Japanese member of the Baltic Exchange in London. Iwai &amp; Company (:ja:岩井商店) was founded as a steel trading firm in 1901 and established a number of prominent group enterprises including Daicel, Nisshin Steel, Tokuyama Soda, Kansai Paint and Fuji Photo Film. It changed its name to Iwai Sangyo Company in 1943.

Both Nissho and Iwai emerged as metals and machinery trading companies after World War II but were significantly smaller than the four largest &quot;sogo shosha&quot; competitors (Mitsubishi Corporation, Mitsui &amp; Co., Itochu and Marubeni). Iwai was poorly managed after the war and was on the brink of failure in the early 1960s, while Nissho was profitable and successfully expanding overseas. The Japanese government directed the merger of the two companies in 1968, forming the fifth largest trading company in Japan (falling back to sixth place in 1972 behind Sumitomo Corporation). Sanwa Bank played a role in the merger and the combined firm became the trading arm of the Sanwa Group &quot;keiretsu&quot;.

Nissho Iwai was involved in a corruption scandal in 1979 after it passed on a 500 million yen bribe from McDonnell Douglas to the director general of the Japan Defense Agency in an attempt to influence the sale of F-4 Phantom aircraft to the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. In the wake of the scandal, one Nissho Iwai executive committed suicide by jumping from the company&#x27;s headquarters building. The scandal was uncovered only three years after a similar scandal involving Lockheed and Marubeni conspiring to bribe Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka.

In subsequent years, the company had a strong focus on liquefied natural gas and steel trading, as well as industrial project development.

===Merger===
Nichimen and Nissho Iwai consolidated on a holding company level in 2003 and consolidated their operating units in 2004, adopting the Sojitz name at that time. The merged holding company, Sojitz Holdings, combined with the merged operating company, Sojitz Corporation, in 2005.

==Current operations==
Today, the Sojitz Group consists of approximately 440 subsidiaries and affiliates located in Japan and throughout the world, and it is developing its wide-ranging general trading company operations in roughly 50 countries and regions across the globe.

Sojitz (through its subsidiary &quot;Sojitz Aerospace Company&quot;) is the largest seller of commercial aircraft in Japan, as it acts as a sales agent for both Boeing and Bombardier Aerospace. It distributes Mitsubishi Motors and Hyundai Motors automobiles in various countries, and also develops and operates power plants, industrial plants in various countries. In 2013 it received an order to develop a section of the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor between Delhi and Mumbai in India. The Sojitz Aerospace Company also acts as Sojitz&#x27;s primary arm for defense related business. 

Sojitz has also invested in Hyundai Nishat, the Pakistani arm of Hyundai Motors in partnership with Nishat Group.

Sojitz owns oil and natural gas concessions in the North Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Qatar, Gabon, Egypt and Brazil. It owns the Gregory coal mine and most of the Minerva Coal Mine in Australia and distributes nuclear fuel in Japan for Orano.

Its operations in the chemicals sector include methanol production in Indonesia, barite mining in Mexico and industrial salt trading in various markets worldwide. In November 2010, it signed an agreement with the Australian rare earths mining company Lynas to import $350 million worth of rare earth minerals from Lynas&#x27; mine in Mount Weld, Australia.

Its consumer business operations include trading in grains, feed, sugar, coffee, fish, wood and paper. It owns the Japanese rights to several consumer brands such as Eastpak and McGregor.

== ADV Films acquisition==
In June 2006, Sojitz acquired a 20% stake in American anime distributor ADV Films. This was done as a means of acquiring more titles in the Japanese market. From this point on, virtually all titles that ADV acquired were under Sojitz&#x27;s ownership. However, in January 2008, ADV mysteriously removed a large number of titles from their website. All the titles removed were titles acquired since the Sojitz acquisition including &quot;Gurren Lagann&quot;, which had test disks sent out with dubbed episodes. As of May 2008, &quot;Gurren Lagann&quot; was licensed by Bandai Entertainment. ADV Films made booth appearances at the Anime Central 2008 convention, but they canceled their planned panel. In July 2008, Funimation announced the acquisition of thirty of these titles.

The titles removed from ADV&#x27;s website are as follows: &quot;009-1&quot;, &quot;5 Centimeters per Second&quot;, &quot;Ah! My Goddess: Flights of Fancy&quot;, both the film and television adaptions of the Key visual novel &quot;Air&quot;, &quot;Best Student Council&quot;, &quot;Blade of the Phantom Master&quot;, &quot;Comic Party Revolution&quot;, &quot;Coyote Ragtime Show&quot;, &quot;Devil May Cry&quot;, the 2006 live-action horror film &quot;Ghost Train&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Innocent Venus&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, the 2006 anime remake of yet another Key visual novel, &quot;Kanon&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Le Chevalier D&#x27;Eon&quot;, &quot;Magikano&quot;, &quot;Moeyo Ken&quot;, &quot;Moonlight Mile&quot;, &quot;Nerima Daikon Brothers&quot;, &quot;Pani Poni Dash!&quot;, &quot;Project Blue Earth SOS&quot;, &quot;Pumpkin Scissors&quot;, &quot;Red Garden&quot;, &quot;Tokyo Majin&quot;, &quot;UFO Princess Valkyrie&quot;, the first anime of &quot;Utawarerumono&quot;, &quot;Venus vs. Virus&quot;, &quot;The Wallflower&quot;, &quot;Welcome to the NHK&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

<text>Demon Hunter is an American Christian metal band from Seattle, Washington, formed by brothers Don Clark and Ryan Clark in 2000. Ryan is the band&#x27;s only remaining original member, as Don left in 2009. As of the 2010s, the band has sold over 600,000 albums.

==History==

===2000s===
Demon Hunter was initially conceived as a project band by the Clarks, who had played together previously in the initially Coalesce and Neurosis influenced but later more experimental band Training for Utopia. Ryan had previously played guitar in hardcore band Focal Point, who released a studio album, &quot;Suffering of the Masses&quot;, on Tooth &amp; Nail Records in 1996 when Ryan was a teenager.

Demon Hunter first appeared on &quot;This Is Solid State Vol. 3&quot;, released on February 26, 2002, which included a demo of the band&#x27;s song &quot;Through the Black&quot;. Demon Hunter&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released on October 22, 2002 on the Tooth &amp; Nail Records subsidiary Solid State Records. Ryan and Don wrote all of the songs, performed the majority of the instruments (with Ryan singing as he had in TFU) and hired Jesse Sprinkle, formerly of Poor Old Lu, to record drum tracks.

The members of the band initially chose to hide or obscure their identities in photos and in the press. Their names were revealed when they undertook their first tour, which featured Norwegian Christian metal band Extol, and death metal-influenced metalcore band The Agony Scene, and after they hired Jesse Sprinkle on drums, Jon Dunn on bass, and Kris McCaddon, formerly of Embodyment and Society&#x27;s Finest, on lead guitar.

Demon Hunter returned to the studio to record their second full-length release, &quot;Summer of Darkness&quot;, with McCaddon contributing, and again with Jesse drumming. &quot;Summer of Darkness&quot; hit stores on May 4, 2004, and was a modest success, propelling Demon Hunter into the secular scene, with the addition of the music video &quot;Not Ready to Die&quot; on MTV2&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot; and Fuse TV, along with single &quot;My Heartstrings Come Undone&quot; being placed on the &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot; soundtrack. The album featured four guest vocal appearances, including Mike Williams of The Agony Scene on &quot;Beheaded&quot;, Brock Lindow of 36 Crazyfists on &quot;Beauty Through The Eyes of a Predator&quot;, Howard Jones from Killswitch Engage on &quot;Our Faces Fall Apart&quot;, and Trevor McNevan of Thousand Foot Krutch on &quot;Coffin Builder&quot;.

Demon Hunter hit the road that summer with McCaddon on lead guitar and Dunn on bass, along with new touring drummer Timothy &quot;Yogi&quot; Watts, as Jesse Sprinkle could not make the tour. This time, Demon Hunter took with them rock/post-hardcore band Dead Poetic, along with metalcore band Haste the Day. Post-hardcore band Staple replaced Haste the Day towards the end of the tour.

In 2005, Demon Hunter went back to The Compound in Seattle, Washington to record their third studio album, entitled &quot;The Triptych&quot;. The word &quot;triptych&quot; centers around the concept of three, as it was the band&#x27;s third album. Included on the album is a cover of Prong&#x27;s song &quot;Snap Your Fingers, Snap Your Neck&quot;. This album debuted Watts as Sprinkle&#x27;s permanent replacement on drums (Jesse having joined Dead Poetic) as well as the addition of Ethan Luck as lead guitarist and backing vocalist, replacing Kris McCaddon. &quot;The Triptych&quot; was even bigger than &quot;Summer of Darkness&quot;, selling more than twice as many records on its first week of release than &quot;Summer of Darkness&quot; had. &quot;Undying&quot; was the band&#x27;s first single from this album, and was also made into a music video directed by Chris Sims.

Demon Hunter&#x27;s only 2006 tour took place over the summer with Zao, Becoming the Archetype, August Burns Red, and Spoken. The band shot a video for &quot;One Thousand Apologies&quot; after the tour was over, with director Darren Doane at the helm. &quot;The Triptych&quot; was re-released on October 31, 2006, with a DVD accompanying the album, and four extra songs added to the original album.

The hard rock and heavy metal based magazine, &quot;Revolver&quot;, published a cover story on Christian metal in December 2006, featuring what the magazine called &quot;The Holy Alliance&quot;: Spencer Chamberlain from Underoath, Ryan Clark from Demon Hunter, Tim Lambesis from As I Lay Dying, and Cory Brandan Putman from Norma Jean.

Demon Hunter entered the studio in June 2007 to record their fourth full-length album, &quot;Storm the Gates of Hell&quot;, which was released on November 6, 2007. Solid State released three versions of the album with various bonuses. &quot;Fading Away&quot; was the album&#x27;s first single and music video. In spite of the bands secular popularity, they continued to support the underground Christian metal scene by appearing on obscure radio programs such as The Full Armor of God Broadcast in January 2008. On March 13, 2008, &quot;Carry Me Down&quot; debuted on &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;″s website as the album&#x27;s second music video, and made its television premiere on March 15 on the same show.
In 2008, the band headlined the &quot;Stronger Than Hell&quot; tour, which started May 26 in Seattle, Washington. The tour featured the recently reunited Christian metal forefathers Living Sacrifice, whose lead singer Bruce Fitzhugh was featured as a guest vocalist on &quot;Storm the Gates of Hell&quot;″s track titled &quot;Sixteen&quot;. The tour also included Oh, Sleeper, The Famine, and Advent. This tour completed July 5, 2008, at Cornerstone Festival in Bushnell, Illinois. Demon Hunter released &quot;45 Days&quot; in November 2008, a box set comprising two DVDs and a CD containing a documentary film about the band and their fans, a pro-shot performance from the &quot;Stronger Than Hell&quot; tour, and a brand new score written exclusively for the film along with two bonus tracks. &quot;45 Days&quot; was directed by Cale Glendening.

A live album, &quot;Live in Nashville&quot;, was released on January 27, 2009; it includes 14 songs from their show in Nashville, Tennessee, from their &quot;Stronger Than Hell&quot; tour. The album features The Showdown lead guitarist Patrick Judge, who filled in for Luck on several of the &quot;Stronger Than Hell&quot; dates due to Luck&#x27;s conflicting scheduling commitments as drummer for Relient K.

Judge also filled in for Brian Leppke of metalcore band Bleeding Through when he was unable to turn up for the Thrash and Burn tour in May.

In August 2009, Don Clark left the band to pursue his graphic designer career, and to be with his family. Ethan Luck also left, as he could not keep up with the hectic schedule of being in both Demon Hunter and Relient K. On August 28, Demon Hunter released an official statement with a new band photograph, stating that Patrick Judge was the new, permanent replacement for Luck. However, the statement made no mention of Randy Torres&#x27;s joining the band; a new band photograph included him as well. An official replacement for Don Clark was announced in Demon Hunter&#x27;s exclusive fan club, The Blessed Resistance, with the announcement of Ryan Helm, formerly of The Ascendicate, as the band&#x27;s new permanent rhythm guitarist.

===2010s===

Demon Hunter released &quot;The World Is a Thorn&quot;, their fifth studio album, on March 9, 2010. It featured guest vocals by Dave Peters of Throwdown in &quot;Feel As Though You Could&quot;, Christian Älvestam of Miseration in &quot;Just Breathe&quot;, and Björn &quot;Speed&quot; Strid of Soilwork featured in the single &quot;Collapsing&quot;. The album debuted at No. 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 14,000.

The band joined As I Lay Dying on tour in March, marking the first time Demon Hunter ever toured as a supporting act, rather than the headliner. Blessthefall and War of Ages were also on the bill. Demon Hunter released an anthology of their first three albums on March 8, 2011, titled &quot;Death, a Destination&quot;. In December 2011, Ryan Helm announced that he would be leaving Demon Hunter to concentrate on his solo project, Damien Deadson. Helm stated that the departure, &quot;was inevitable; however, it was on good terms.&quot;

In January 2012, it was announced on the Solid State Records website that Jeremiah Scott, bassist for The Showdown, had joined the band in the position of rhythm guitar.

Their sixth full-length album, &quot;True Defiance&quot;, released April 10, 2012, was a commercial success, reaching No. 36 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 2 on the Top Christian Albums chart; it received generally positive to mixed reviews. A month before the album was released, Demon Hunter released the song &quot;My Destiny&quot; as the first official single from the album and released &quot;Someone to Hate&quot; and &quot;Dead Flowers&quot; as promotional singles. The band also released a deluxe edition of the album that included two bonus songs, &quot;What is Left&quot; and &quot;I Am a Stone&quot;.

In July 2012, the band toured for the album along with Bleeding Through, Cancer Bats, and The Plot in You. Not long after, they also announced a tour in the countries of Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia in South America. The band was part of a tour called &quot;Another Year Another Tour&quot;, their first tour of 2013, alongside headline act In Flames, as well two other bands, All Shall Perish, and Battlecross.
Demon Hunter began releasing teaser posts on January 30, 2014, related to seventh full-length album &quot;Extremist&quot;, which was released on March 18, 2014. Demon Hunter released the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Artificial Light&quot;, on their YouTube account February 13, 2014, and also released websites to pre-order their new album. &quot;The Last One Alive&quot;, and &quot;I Will Fail You&quot; were eventually released as promotional singles shortly after. &quot;Extremist&quot; debuted at No. 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 selling approximately 18,000 copies in the first week of release. This is the band&#x27;s highest chart debut, being 20 steps higher than their highly regarded previous effort, &quot;True Defiance&quot; which debuted at No. 36.

In August 2014, the band went on a brief tour with Red and Veridia.

The band&#x27;s first and only concert in 2015 was at Uprise Festival in Shippensburg, Pennsylvania.

Demon Hunter officially released their eighth studio album, &quot;Outlive&quot;, on Solid State Records on March 31, 2017. In December 2016, they released the first single for &quot;Outlive&quot;: &quot;Cold Winter Sun&quot;. On February 15, 2017, they announced that a music video for their second single &quot;Died In My Sleep&quot; would be released.

On December 3, 2018, the band announced two albums—&quot;War&quot; and &quot;Peace&quot;—were scheduled to be released in March 2019. Demon Hunter released both albums on March 1, 2019. On March 16, 2019, the two albums made it into top 5 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Christian Albums with &quot;War&quot; in the second place and &quot;Peace&quot; in the third place.

===2020s===
On November 10, 2020, the band announced their first acoustic album, &quot;Songs of Death and Resurrection&quot;, which would feature acoustic renditions of songs such as &quot;Dead Flowers&quot; and &quot;The Heart of a Graveyard&quot;, as well as featuring a new song, &quot;Praise the Void&quot;, which would be released on March 5, 2021.

On December 15, 2021, it was announced that Richie Faulkner of Judas Priest recorded a guitar solo for Demon Hunter&#x27;s album, &quot;Exile&quot;, later announced for release on September 9, 2022, then delayed to October 28, 2022. The band quickly released three singles, &quot;Freedom is Dead&quot;, &quot;Silence the World&quot;, and &quot;Defense Mechanism&quot;, the latter two featuring Tom S. Englund (Evergrey) and Max Cavalera (ex-Sepultura, Soulfly) respectively, all released through their self-founded record label, Weapons MFG.

Demon Hunter started writing a follow-up album to &quot;Exile&quot; as early as October in 2022, shortly before their new album&#x27;s release.

On February 10, 2023, the band released a b-side from the &quot;Exile&quot; recording sessions, &quot;The Brink&quot;, which had been an exclusive song to Demon Hunter&#x27;s fan club, The Blessed Resistance, in 2022.

On October 6, 2023, the band released another single, &quot;Some of Us&quot;, currently as a standalone single. This was followed by other standalone singles, &quot;Worlds Apart&quot;, on March 1, 2024, and &quot;Black Stained Glass&quot; on May 10, 2024.

On February 7th, 2025, alternative rock band Set the Sun released a collaboration with Demon Hunter titled &quot;Falling Apart&quot;.

==Christianity==
Don Clark stated, &quot;I guess we liked to ride the fence. Then we got a little older, maybe wiser, and you know what, we&#x27;re a Christian band. We&#x27;re five dudes, we&#x27;re all believers, we really don&#x27;t want to ride the fence anymore.&quot; Ryan Clark claimed, &quot;When we officially started we wanted to be very bold about it, we didn&#x27;t see any purpose of just beating around the bush.&quot; Fans who are Christians are supportive of the band&#x27;s bold faith position. &quot;They respect that we don&#x27;t walk the fence between a non-Christian and Christian band.&quot; Demon Hunter&#x27;s official website stated in 2008 that they are &quot;absolutely&quot; a Christian band and the band members &quot;are all Bible believing followers of Jesus Christ.&quot;

==Reported use by the military==
According to an &quot;Esquire&quot; interview in February 2013, after Metallica requested that the US military stop using their music during interrogations in Iraq, Demon Hunter allegedly contacted the US military, offering their music as an alternative, which was accepted. A Navy SEAL who claimed to have killed Bin Laden was quoted as saying &quot;&#x27;[W]e stopped using [Metallica&#x27;s] music, and then a band called Demon Hunter got in touch and said, &quot;We&#x27;re all about promoting what you do.&quot; They sent us CDs and patches. I wore my Demon Hunter patch on every mission. I wore it when I blasted bin Laden.&#x27;&quot; The day after the story broke, Demon Hunter addressed the situation by saying they approved US servicemen wearing their patch, but they didn&#x27;t volunteer their music, nor did they have any knowledge of it being used for interrogations.

<text>The Royal Palace of Amsterdam in Amsterdam (Dutch: &quot;Koninklijk Paleis van Amsterdam&quot; or ) is one of three palaces in the Netherlands which are at the disposal of the monarch by Act of Parliament. It is situated on the west side of Dam Square in the centre of Amsterdam, opposite the War Memorial and next to the Nieuwe Kerk.

The palace was built as a city hall during the Dutch Golden Age in the 17th century. The building became the royal palace of King Louis Bonaparte and later of the Dutch Royal House.

==History==
===Town hall===
The structure was built as the Town Hall of the City of Amsterdam &quot;facing the landing wharfs along Damrak, which at that time would have been busy with ships&quot;. The town hall was opened on 29 July 1655 by Cornelis de Graeff, the mayor of Amsterdam. De Graeff&#x27;s son Jacob de Graeff laid the foundation for this along with three other children. The main architect was Jacob van Campen, who took control of the construction project in 1648. It was built on 13,659 wooden piles.

===Palace===
After the patriot revolution which swept the House of Orange from power a decade earlier, the new Batavian Republic was forced to accept Louis Bonaparte, brother of Napoleon Bonaparte, as King Louis I of Holland in 1806. After holding his court at The Hague and Utrecht, Louis Napoleon moved to Amsterdam, and converted the Town Hall into a royal palace for himself.

It was made property of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1936.

The palace is used by the monarch for entertaining and official functions during state visits and other official receptions, such as New Year receptions. The award ceremonies of the Erasmus Prize, of the Silver Carnation, of the Royal Awards for Modern Painting, and of the Prince Claus Awards are also held in the palace.

The balcony of the Royal Palace was used during the investiture of Queen Beatrix in 1980, where her mother Juliana announced the new queen to the people.

The palace was renovated from 2005 until June 2009, during which, among other things, asbestos was removed. Since 14 June 2009, the palace is open again to visitors.

==Notable features==
The sandstone of yellowish hue has darkened considerably in the course of time. Astride the rear of the building is a 6-metre-tall statue of Atlas carrying the Globe on his shoulders.

<text>Öræfajökull (; &#x27;Öræfi glacier&#x27; or &#x27;wasteland glacier&#x27;) is an ice-covered volcano in south-east Iceland. The largest active volcano and the highest peak in Iceland at , it lies within the Vatnajökull National Park and is covered by part of the glacier.

The original Norse settlers named the volcano Knappafellsjǫkull (Old Norse: ; Modern Icelandic: Hnappafellsjökull ; &#x27;knobs mountain glacier&#x27;). The current name, &quot;Öræfajökull&quot;, was eventually adopted after the 1362 eruption.

==Description==
Öræfajökull is located at the southern extremity of the Vatnajökull glacier and overlooking the Ring Road between Höfn and Vík. It is the largest active volcano in the country, and on the summit crater&#x27;s north-western rim is Hvannadalshnúkur, the highest peak in Iceland at . 

Geographically, Öræfajökull as the glacier, is considered part of Vatnajökull, and the area covered by glacier is within the boundary of Vatnajökull National Park. There are a number of outlet glaciers in the ice cap within the area of the central volcano which clockwise from north are: Breiðamerkurjökull, Fjallsjökull, Hrútárjökull, Bræðrajökull, Kviarjökull, Hólárjökull, Stórhöfðajökull, Gljúfursárjökull, Rótarfjallsjökull (which has a western branch called Kotárjökull), Grænafjallsjökull, Falljökull, Virkisjökull, Svinafellsjökull and Skaftafellsjökull. While most of the outlet glaciers have reasonably clear catchments, not all do. Some of the icecap feeds directly into river catchments without a named glacier and this happens between the Hrútárjökull and Bræðrajökull, and the Virkisá river drains a number of glaciers between Rótarfjallsjökull and Svinafellsjökull (see map on this page). 

The summit caldera of this stratovolcano is and the volcano is in diameter. It is the most southern of the volcanoes in the Öræfi volcanic belt (Öræfajökull volcanic belt), which is possibly an embryonic rift parallel and to the east of the Eastern volcanic zone.
The presently active summit caldera may have a subcaldera within it. Eruptions in this area are most likely to result in jökulhlaups that will produce floods at the outlets of the Kviarjökull and Virkisá catchments as these overlap the present caldera. There is possibly an old caldera to the north of the current caldera and flank eruptions could produce jökulhlaup from other outlet glaciers. The topographical map on this page can be enlarged to show this detail. 

==Activity==
Öræfajökull has erupted twice in historical times, in 1362 and 1728. These were explosive silicic eruptions with bulk tephra volumes of and jökulhlaups occurred. The deposits closer to the central volcano are rhyolytic but the more distal lava flows which can extend for from the caldera are alkali olivine basalt and both have been erupted in the Holocene.

===1362 eruption===
In 1362, Knappafellsjökull erupted explosively, ejecting 10 cubic kilometres of tephra, similar in scale to the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo. The eruption sequence lasted for several months, being from a medium-potassium alkali rhyolite and has been assigned a VEI of 6 although dense-rock equivalent volume may be less than previous estimates at . The wealthy district of Litlahérað was destroyed by floods, pyroclastic flows and ashfall. Sailors reported pumice “in such masses that ships could hardly make their way through it.” Thick volcanic deposits obliterated farmland, and ash travelled as far as western Europe. Forty farms were destroyed. More than 40 years passed before people again settled the area, which became known as Öræfi. The name literally means &#x27;an area without harbour,&#x27; but it took on a meaning of &#x27;wasteland&#x27; in Icelandic, as the 1362 eruption had drastically altered the environment around the mountain. The volcano likewise took on the new name Öræfajökull.

===1728 eruption===
An eruption in August 1727–1728 was smaller than 1362, though floods are known to have caused three fatalities when the meltwater swept their farm away.
===2017 activity===
Increased earthquake activity in the form of small tremors ranging from a depth of 1.5–10 km beneath the summit crater, began in August 2017 according to the Icelandic Meteorological Office.

The Aviation Colour Code of the United States was raised to yellow on 17 November 2017, after the appearance of an ice cauldron inside the main crater and increased geothermal activity under the glacier.

===2018 activity===
The seismic and geothermal activity which began in August 2017 continued into 2018, but at reduced levels. On 4 May 2018, the Icelandic Meteorological Office lowered the Aviation Colour Code to green. 

== Landslide ==
In 2013 due to paraglacial slope failure, a large landslide affecting an area of occurred, that deposited debris on the volcano&#x27;s Svínafellsjökull outlet glacier.

<text>Sir Alfred Edward East, RA, RBA (15 December 1844 – 28 September 1913) was an English painter.

==Life==
East was born in Kettering in Northamptonshire and studied at the Glasgow School of Art. His romantic landscapes show the influence of the Barbizon school. His &quot;The Art of Landscape Painting in Oil Colour&quot; was published in 1906. In April 1888 he had shared an exhibition at the galleries of the Fine Art Society with T. C. Gotch and W. Ayerst Ingram, and was commissioned the following year by Marcus Huish, managing director of the Society, to spend six months in Japan to paint the landscape and the people of the country. When the exhibition of 104 paintings from this tour was held at the Fine Art Society in 1890 it was a spectacular success.

East visited Spain after 1892 when he visited Algeciras at the southern end of Iberia.

In 1906 he was elected president of the Royal Society of British Artists, a position he held until his death. In that year, he published his 107-page illustrated &quot;The Art of Landscape Painting in Oil Colour&quot;; in its preface, he made the observation: &quot;The greatest errors in landscape painting are to be found – contradictory as it may appear – not so much in the matter of technique as in the painter&#x27;s attitude toward Nature&quot;. In this book he described his techniques using colours, half-tones and pencil sketches.

He was awarded a knighthood in 1910 by King Edward VII. His portrait was painted by Philip de László. The Alfred East Art Gallery in Kettering, designed by John Alfred Gotch opened on 31 July 1913. The Alfred East Gallery is Northamptonshire&#x27;s oldest purpose-built art gallery.

East was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1899, having been a regular exhibitor since 1883 and elected to full membership in 1913.

On 28 September 1913, Alfred East died at his London residence in Belsize Park. His body was taken back to Kettering and lay in state in the Art Gallery, where it was surrounded by the pictures he had presented to the town, and attracted crowds of several thousands.

<doc id="674830" wikidata="Q180983" url="?curid=674830" title="Cytarabine">
<text>Cytarabine, also known as cytosine arabinoside (ara-C), is a chemotherapy medication used to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma. It is given by injection into a vein, under the skin, or into the cerebrospinal fluid. There is a liposomal formulation for which there is tentative evidence of better outcomes in lymphoma involving the meninges.
Common side effects include bone marrow suppression, vomiting, diarrhea, liver problems, rash, ulcer formation in the mouth, and bleeding. Other serious side effects include loss of consciousness, lung disease, and allergic reactions. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. Cytarabine is in the antimetabolite and nucleoside analog families of medication. It works by blocking the function of DNA polymerase.
Cytarabine was patented in 1960 and approved for medical use in 1969. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

==Medical uses==
Cytarabine is mainly used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia, acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) and in lymphomas, where it is the backbone of induction chemotherapy.

Cytarabine also possesses antiviral activity, and it has been used for the treatment of generalised herpesvirus infection. However, cytarabine is not very selective in this setting and causes bone marrow suppression and other severe side effects. Therefore, ara-C is not a useful antiviral agent in humans because of its toxic profile.

Cytarabine is also used in the study of the nervous system to control the proliferation of glial cells in cultures, the amount of glial cells having an important impact on neurons. Recently, cytarabine was reported to promote robust and persistent neuronal differentiation in NSC-34 motor neuron-like cell line. Cytarabine is permissive, dispensable, and mostly irreversible in priming NSC-34 cells for neurite initiation and regeneration after mechanical dislodgement.

==Side effects==
One of the unique toxicities of cytarabine is cerebellar toxicity when given in high doses, which may lead to ataxia. Cytarabine may cause granulocytopenia and other impaired body defenses, which may lead to infection, and thrombocytopenia, which may lead to hemorrhage.

Toxicity: pancreatitis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, GI disturbances, stomatitis, conjunctivitis, pneumonitis, fever, and dermatitis, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia. Rarely, myelopathy has been reported after high dose or frequent intrathecal Ara-C administration.

When used in protocols designated as high dose, cytarabine can cause cerebral and cerebellar dysfunction, ocular toxicity, pulmonary toxicity, severe GI ulceration and peripheral neuropathy (rare).

To prevent the side effects and improve the therapeutic efficiency, various derivatives of these drugs (including amino acid, peptide, fatty acid and phosphates) have been evaluated, as well as different delivery systems.

==Mechanism of action==
Cytosine arabinoside combines a cytosine base with an arabinose sugar. It is an antimetabolic agent with the chemical name of &quot;1β-arabinofuranosylcytosine&quot;. Certain sponges, where similar compounds were originally found, use arabinoside sugars for chemical defense. Cytosine arabinoside is similar enough to human deoxycytosine to be incorporated into human DNA, but different enough that it kills the cell. Cytosine arabinoside interferes with the synthesis of DNA. Its mode of action is due to its rapid conversion into cytosine arabinoside triphosphate, which damages DNA when the cell cycle holds in the S phase (synthesis of DNA). Rapidly dividing cells, which require DNA replication for mitosis, are therefore most affected. Cytosine arabinoside also inhibits both DNA and RNA polymerases and nucleotide reductase enzymes needed for DNA synthesis. Cytarabine is the first of a series of cancer drugs that altered the sugar component of nucleosides. Other cancer drugs modify the base.

Cytarabine is often given by continuous intravenous infusion, which follows a biphasic elimination – initial fast clearance rate followed by a slower rate of the analog. Cytarabine is transported into the cell primarily by hENT-1. It is then monophosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase and eventually cytarabine-5´-triphosphate, which is the active metabolite being incorporated into DNA during DNA synthesis.

Several mechanisms of resistance have been reported. Cytarabine is rapidly deaminated by cytidine deaminase in the serum into the inactive uracil derivative. Cytarabine-5´-monophosphate is deaminated by deoxycytidylate deaminase, leading to the inactive uridine-5´-monophosphate analog. Cytarabine-5´-triphosphate is a substrate for SAMHD1. Furthermore, SAMHD1 has been shown to limit the efficacy of cytarabine efficacy in patients.

When used as an antiviral, cytarabine-5´-triphosphate functions by inhibiting viral DNA synthesis. Cytarabine is able to inhibit herpesvirus and vaccinia virus replication in cells during tissue culture. However, cytarabine treatment was only effective for herpesvirus infection in a murine model.

In mice, Ara-CTP (cytarabine-5&#x27;-triphosphate) blocks memory consolidation, but not short-term memory, of a context fear conditioning event. The blockage of memory consolidation was proposed to be due to the inhibition by Ara-CTP of the DNA non-homologous end joining pathway. Thus transient DNA breakage followed by non-homologous end joining appear to be necessary steps in the formation of a long-term memory of an event.

==History==
Isolation of arabinose-containing nucleotides from the Caribbean sponge &quot;Cryptotheca crypta&quot; (now &quot;Tectitethya crypta&quot;) together with the realization that these compounds could act as DNA synthesis chain terminators led to exploration of these novel nucleotides as potential anticancer therapeutics. Cytarabine was first synthesized in 1959 by Richard Walwick, Walden Roberts, and Charles Dekker at the University of California, Berkeley.

It was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in June 1969, and was initially marketed in the US by Upjohn under the brand name Cytosar-U.

==Names==
It is also known as ara-C (arabinofuranosyl cytidine).

<doc id="674832" wikidata="Q4065196" url="?curid=674832" title="Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913">
<text>The Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913, also known as the &quot;Blue Line&quot;, was an agreement between the Sublime Porte of the Ottoman Empire and the Government of the United Kingdom which defined the limits of Ottoman jurisdiction in the area of the Persian Gulf with respect to Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and the Shatt al-Arab. It was signed on 29 July 1913, but never ratified. The long-lasting impact of the agreement was that of the status of Kuwait; the basis for both formal independence and the frontiers of modern Kuwait were established.

==Background==
Informal negotiations began on 29 July 1911 in a British memorandum sent to the Ottoman Government. By this time, it seemed likely that the terminus for the German funded and engineered Baghdad Railway would be situated in Kuwait. Kuwait had been under Ottoman administration since 1871 and in 1875 was included in the Basra Vilayet. Although the sheikhdom now fell under the Empire’s jurisdiction, no Ottoman official was stationed in Kuwait. Influence over Kuwait was crucial to British foreign policy in the Persian Gulf with regard to commerce and strategic interests concerning India.

To the British, further extension of the railway line meant further expansion of Ottoman influence, and the current administration—already emboldened by the “Young Turk” regime—desired to reestablish effective control over its empire south of Kuwait. Even worse was the possible encroachment of other European powers. In the proposed memorandum, the British therefore sought to regularize the 1901 Status Quo agreement, with the added refinement of a clear definition of Kuwait&#x27;s boundaries to Britain&#x27;s advantage.

Although at times deadlocked, negotiations communicated via memorandums continued on a quid pro quo basis in which the British had the advantage; if the Ottomans were to accept Kuwait&#x27;s autonomous status and proposed boundaries, the British would have to accept Ottoman suzerainty, and in return, the northern islands of Warbah and Bubiyan must be allocated to Kuwait, and so forth. The waning influence of Istanbul in the Gulf forced it to make concessions without much to gain in return. The Ottoman Empire had faced a number of setbacks in the last few decades—a few of its provinces achieved independence, some were annexed by other countries, or many lost in conflict—and for internal political reasons it may have seemed important to maintain Kuwait as part of the empire, even if only symbolically. The Ottomans also felt that making this agreement would ensure British support on other more pressing issues, such as dealing with invasion by other European powers and conflicts in other parts of the Ottoman Empire. Furthermore, British pressures led the Ottomans to abandon the proposed extension of the railway line to Kuwait and instead opt for a Basra terminus. Plans for a Basra terminus created a new series of demands on behalf of the British, including the Ottoman renunciation of Qatar, and delineating its role in the wider Persian Gulf waters. Britain had wanted to conclude agreements with Sheikh of Qatar Jasim al-Thani about illicit arms traffic and maritime peace, and also sought to formally establish its dominance in the Gulf. By 6 May 1913 Britain and the Ottoman Empire initialed the compromise and the Anglo-Ottoman Convention was signed on 29 July 1913, exactly two years after the first memorandum.

===Non-ratification===
The Anglo-Ottoman Convention was only part of a wider bargaining process and the complexities of the competing European commercial interests in the region prevented its ratification. Russia, France, and Germany (and later Italy) also had been pressing the Ottoman government for railway concessions. Ratification was further complicated by the fact that most of the Powers themselves were engaged in bilateral negotiations with the Ottoman Empire, just as the British had done with this Convention. Also, attempts to obtain oil concessions from the Ottoman government added to the complexity of commercial arrangements. Finally, the Ottomans and British emerged as enemies within months of the Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913, as the outbreak of World War I diminished any hope left for ratification.

Prior to the outbreak of hostilities a companion agreement covering the rest of the Arabian Peninsula, the Violet Line, was also negotiated.

==Terms==
===I. Kuwait===
Section I of the convention comprised ten articles concerning the status of Kuwait, and its territorial boundaries. It included contradictory provisions in that the British acknowledged Kuwait as an autonomous provincial sub-district (&quot;kaza&quot;) of the Ottoman Empire within the drawn green-zone and pledged to not establish a protectorate, while the Ottoman Empire recognized the validity of agreements that had made Kuwait a British protectorate except by name and recognized Kuwait as an independent entity within the drawn red-zone.

According to the agreement, Kuwait constituted “an autonomous kaza of the Ottoman Empire,” thereby recognizing Sheikh Mubarak al-Sabah as ruler of Kuwait as well as &quot;kaymakam&quot; (Ottoman district governor) (Article 1). Kuwait was listed as such because the Ottomans and British interpretations of “sovereignty” and “suzerainty” differed in their counter-drafts and so both terms were omitted in the final draft.

As it was an “autonomous” &quot;kaza&quot;, the Ottoman government agreed to refrain from interfering in the affairs of Kuwait, “including the question of succession, and from any administrative as well as any occupation or military act.” It also allowed for the use of the Ottoman flag with the option to inscribe the word “Kuwait” on it (Article 2).

The agreement also identified the territories of Kuwait as two different regions, demarcated in red and green on a map annexed to the convention. The red line, as it is commonly referred to, demarcated the region in which the sheikh was to have “complete administrative autonomy.” This region was formed by “a semicircle with the town of Kuwayt in the center, the Khawr al-Zubayr at the northern extremity and al-Qurrayin at the southern extremity” (Article 5). This also included the surrounding islands of Warba and Bubiyan, which were major bargaining points for the British who viewed the Ottoman military posts on the islands as a threat.

The green line defined the region in which the Sheikh of Kuwait would exercise the administrative rights of an Ottoman &quot;kaymakam&quot;. The tribes situated in that area were “recognized within the dependence of the Shaykh of Kuwait,” and as &quot;kaymakam&quot; he was required to collect tribute (Article 6). The importance of the green line is that it set out for the first time the basis for the established frontiers of modern Kuwait:
:The demarcation line begins on the coast at the mouth of Khor al-Zubair in the northwest and crosses immediately south of Umm-Qasr, Safwan, and Jabla Sanam, in such a way as to leave to the vilayet of Basrah these locations and their wells; arriving at the al-Batin, it follows it toward the southwest until Hafr-al-Batin which it leaves on the same side as Kuwayt; from that point on the line in question goes southeast leaving to the wells of al-Safah, al-Garaa, al-Haba, al-Warbah, and Antaa, reaching the sea near Jabal Munifa (Article 7).
Another major provision, and one which the Ottomans required, was that of the British declaration that no protectorate would be established over Kuwait (Article 4). Yet, the Ottoman government recognized the validity of the Anglo-Kuwaiti Agreement of 1899, and the 1900 and 1904 agreements in which Kuwait had undertaken not to engage in arms trade or allow another power to establish a post office, as well as land concessions made by the Sheikh to the British government (Article 3). 
Smaller provisions were also added at the convention, which included the Sheikh&#x27;s right to his private property in the vilayet of Basra (Article 9) and extradition (Article 10).

===II. Qatar &amp; III. Bahrain===
Section II and III constitute provisions for Qatar and Bahrain, respectively. Central to the negotiations was the status of Qatar and Bahrain, and the British pressured the Ottoman government that it should renounce its claims to both. If the Ottoman government retained sovereignty over Qatar and Bahrain that would enable it the right to still intervene in matters of the Gulf, of which the British desired to retain a monopoly.

The Ottomans were willing to drop all claims to Bahrain, in which they had never been able to maintain anything but a symbolic role, but not Qatar. As a question of sovereignty, the Ottomans argued that the empire had always exercised effective sovereignty over the peninsula and could not justify the abandonment of territory which it had never formally renounced. Yet under considerable pressure it renounced claims to both (Articles 11 &amp; 13) and a blue line was established to define the territorial limits of Ottoman jurisdiction. This line separated the Ottoman sanjak of Najd from Qatar. The blue line began a few miles to the south of Zaknuniya (which was included in the sanjak), directly south up to the Rub&#x27; al-Khali (Article 11). The agreement did not mention that Zaknuniya would be part of the Najd sanjak in return for an Ottoman consideration of £1,000 paid to the Sheikh of Bahrain via the British government.

With regard to Bahrain, the Ottomans renounced all claims to it so long as the British declared no intention of annexing it (Article 13) and did not claim capitulation rights for subjects of the Sheikh of Bahrain (protected by the Britannic Majesty&#x27;s Consuls) living in the Ottoman Empire (Article 15).

===IV. The Persian Gulf===
The final step in ensuring its dominance over the Persian Gulf was formalizing British policing of the Gulf. Therefore, “for the Protection of its special interests…in the free water of the Persian Gulf and on the borders belonging to the independent Shaykhs from the south of al-Qatar up to the Indian Ocean,” the British were able to continue exercising, as in the past, the following measures (Article 16): 
::(a) Soundings, lighting of lighthouses, placement of buoys, piloting
::(b) Maritime police
::(c) Quarantine measures

<text>Jessye Mae Norman (September 15, 1945 – September 30, 2019) was an American opera singer and recitalist. She was able to perform dramatic soprano roles, but did not limit herself to that voice type. A commanding presence on operatic, concert and recital stages, Norman was associated with roles including Beethoven&#x27;s Leonore, Wagner&#x27;s Sieglinde and Kundry, Berlioz&#x27;s Cassandre and Didon, and Bartók&#x27;s Judith. &quot;The New York Times&quot; music critic Edward Rothstein described her voice as a &quot;grand mansion of sound&quot;, and wrote that &quot;it has enormous dimensions, reaching backward and upward. It opens onto unexpected vistas. It contains sunlit rooms, narrow passageways, cavernous halls.&quot;

Norman trained at Howard University, the Peabody Institute, and the University of Michigan. Her career began in Europe, where she won the ARD International Music Competition in Munich in 1968, which led to a contract with the Deutsche Oper Berlin. Her operatic début came as Elisabeth in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;, after which she sang as Verdi&#x27;s Aida at La Scala in Milan. She made her first operatic appearance in the U.S. in 1982 with the Opera Company of Philadelphia, when cast as Jocasta in Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Oedipus rex&quot;, and as Dido in Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot;. She went on to sing leading roles with many other companies, including the Metropolitan Opera, the Lyric Opera of Chicago, the Paris Opera, and the Royal Opera, London. Internationally well known, she was invited to sing at the second inauguration of Ronald Reagan and at Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s 60th birthday celebration in 1986 and performed &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution on July 14, 1989. She sang at the 1996 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in Atlanta and for the second inauguration of Bill Clinton in 1997.

Norman sang and recorded recitals of music by Franz Schubert, Johannes Brahms, Richard Strauss, Gustav Mahler, Ernest Chausson and Francis Poulenc, among others. In 1984, she won the Grammy Award for Best Classical Vocal Solo, the first of five Grammy Awards that she would collect during her career. Apart from several honorary doctorates and other awards, she received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, the National Medal of Arts, the , and was named a member of the British Royal Academy of Music. In 1990, UN secretary-general Javier Pérez de Cuéllar named her Honorary Ambassador to the United Nations.

== Life and career ==
=== Early life and musical education ===
Norman was born in Augusta, Georgia, to Silas Norman, an insurance salesman, and Janie King-Norman, a schoolteacher. She was one of five children in a family of amateur musicians; her mother and grandmother were both pianists, and her father sang in a local choir. All siblings learned to play the piano early. Norman attended Charles T. Walker Elementary School, and proved to be a talented singer as a young child, singing gospel songs at Mount Calvary Baptist Church at the age of four. There she was greatly influenced by the singing of two women, Mrs. Golden and Sister Childs. At the age of seven she entered her first vocal competition, placing third only because of a memory slip in the second stanza of the hymn &quot;God Will Take Care of You&quot;. She later said in interviews, &quot;I guess He has taken care of me. That was my last memory slip in public.&quot;

When Norman was nine she was given a radio for her birthday and soon discovered the world of opera through the weekly broadcasts of the Metropolitan Opera, which she listened to every Saturday. She started listening to recordings of Marian Anderson and Leontyne Price, both of whom Norman credited as inspiring figures in her career. She received her first formal vocal coaching from Rosa Harris Sanders Creque, who was her music teacher at A. R. Johnson Junior High School. She continued to take voice lessons privately with Ms. Sanders Creque while attending Lucy C. Laney Senior High School in downtown Augusta.

Norman studied at the Interlochen Center for the Arts in Northern Michigan in the opera performance program. At the age of 16, she entered the Marian Anderson Vocal Competition in Philadelphia which, although she did not win, led to an offer of a full scholarship at Howard University, in Washington, D.C. While at Howard, studying voice with Carolyn Grant, she sang in the university chorus and as a soloist at the Lincoln Temple United Church of Christ. In 1964, she became a member of Gamma Sigma Sigma.

In 1965, along with 33 other female students and four female faculty, Norman became a founding member of the Delta Nu chapter of Sigma Alpha Iota music fraternity. In 1966, she won the National Society of Arts and Letters singing competition. After graduating in 1967 with a degree in music, she began graduate studies at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore and later at the University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre &amp; Dance in Ann Arbor, Michigan, from which she earned a master&#x27;s degree in 1968. During this time, Norman studied voice with Elizabeth Mannion and Pierre Bernac.

=== Early career (1968–1979) ===
After graduating, Norman, like many American young musicians at the time, moved to Europe to establish herself. In 1968, she won the ARD International Music Competition in Munich. The following year, she began a three-year contract with the Deutsche Oper Berlin, where she first appeared as Elisabeth in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;.

Norman performed as a guest with German and Italian opera companies, often portraying noble characters convincingly, both by appearance and by unique voice which was both flexible and powerful. Her voice range was wide, from contralto registers to dramatic soprano. In 1970, she appeared in Florence in the title role in Handel&#x27;s &quot;Deborah&quot;. In 1971, she sang at the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino in the role of Sélika in Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot;. The same year, she portrayed Countess Almaviva in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot;, alongside Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau as the count at the Berlin Festival, and recorded the role with the BBC Orchestra conducted by Colin Davis. The recording was a finalist for the Montreux International Record Award competition and exposed her to music listeners in Europe and the United States.

In 1972, Norman made her first appearance at La Scala, where she sang the title role in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot; and at The Royal Opera at Covent Garden, London, where she appeared as Cassandra in &quot;Les Troyens&quot; by Berlioz. Norman was Aida again in a concert version that same year in her first well-publicized American performance at the Hollywood Bowl for the venue&#x27;s 50th anniversary celebration. This was followed by an all-Wagner concert at the Tanglewood Music Festival in Lenox, Massachusetts, and a recital tour of the country, after which she returned to Europe for several engagements. Norman briefly returned to the United States to give her first New York City recital as part of the &quot;Great Performers&quot; series in Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in 1973.

In 1975, Norman moved to London and had no staged opera appearances for the next five years. She remained internationally active as a recitalist and soloist in works such as Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Elijah&quot; and Franck&#x27;s &quot;Les Béatitudes&quot;. Norman returned to North America again in 1976 and 1977 to make an extensive concert tour. Norman toured Europe throughout the 1970s, giving recitals of works by Schubert, Mahler, Wagner, Brahms, Satie, Messiaen, and several contemporary American composers, to great critical acclaim.

=== Mid-career (1980–1989) ===
In October 1980, Norman returned to the operatic stage in the title role of &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; by Richard Strauss at the Hamburg State Opera in Germany. Her first operatic appearance in the United States came in 1982 at the Opera Company of Philadelphia, where she appeared as Jocasta in Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Oedipus rex&quot;, and as Purcell&#x27;s Dido. On July 18 she sang Didon in a concert performance of the second part of Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Les Troyens&quot; (as &quot;Les Troyens à Carthage&quot;), conducted by Gennady Rozhdestvensky. The performance was broadcast on BBC Radio 3, and an audio recording exists.

Her stage debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City was on September 26, 1983, the opening night of the company&#x27;s 100th-anniversary season, when she portrayed Cassandre in Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Les Troyens&quot; with Plácido Domingo as Aeneas, Tatiana Troyanos as Didon, and James Levine conducting. According to Donal Henahan, the music critic of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;she sang grippingly and projected well, even when placed well back in the cavernous sets.&quot; The fourth performance, with the same cast, was telecast as part of the &quot;Live from the Met&quot; series. A video recording has been issued on DVD and is available for streaming at the Met Opera on Demand website. On October 12 and 17, the fifth and sixth performances in the run of nine, she sang Didon with William Lewis as Aeneas and Gwynn Cornell as Cassandre. Reviewing the October 12 performance, Edward Rothstein of &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;she created a Carthaginian Queen who was both regal and vulnerable. It was a subtle and affecting dramatic portrait... Her farewell aria was fluid and seductive, suggesting in its timbre both sensuous pleasures and death.&quot; On February 8, the seventh performance of the series, she returned to the role of Cassandre, with Edward Sooter as Aeneas and Troyanos as Didon, but replaced Troyanos as Didon for act 5. On February 13, the eighth performance, she again sang Didon, with Sooter as Aeneas and Cornell as Cassandre, and on February 18, the ninth and final performance of the series, she sang both Cassandre and Didon, with Sooter as Aeneas. Regarding the last performance, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;the audience gave Miss Norman a 15-minute standing ovation that brought her back to the stage more than a half dozen times.&quot; The performance was broadcast on the Metropolitan Opera Radio, and an audio recording is available.

Norman programmed recitals innovatively, including contemporary music. She commissioned the song cycle &quot;woman.life.song&quot; by composer Judith Weir, a work premiered at Carnegie Hall, with texts by Toni Morrison, Maya Angelou and Clarissa Pinkola Estés. In a review of a recital at Alice Tully Hall, Bernard Holland wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that she &quot;carefully gauged her seemingly limitless resources to fit the changing textures of her material&quot;. After a recital at Carnegie Hall, Allen Hughes wrote in the same paper that Norman &quot;has one of the most opulent voices before the public today, and, as discriminating listeners are aware, her performances are backed by extraordinary preparation, both musical and otherwise.&quot;

According to &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;: &quot;By the mid-1980s she was one of the most popular and highly regarded dramatic soprano singers in the world.&quot; She told John Gruen in an interview: &quot;As for my voice, it cannot be categorizedand I like it that way, because I sing things that would be considered in the dramatic, mezzo or spinto range. I like so many different kinds of music that I&#x27;ve never allowed myself the limitations of one particular range.&quot; She was invited to sing at the second inauguration of U.S. President Ronald Reagan on January 21, 1985; she performed &quot;Simple Gifts&quot; from Aaron Copland&#x27;s &quot;Old American Songs&quot; at the ceremony. In 1986, Norman sang &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; for Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s 60th-birthday celebration. That same year she appeared as a soloist in Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Four Last Songs&quot; with the Berlin Philharmonic during its tour of the United States.

Over the years Norman expanded her talent into less familiar areas. In 1988, she sang a concert performance of Poulenc&#x27;s one-act opera &quot;La voix humaine&quot; (&quot;The Human Voice&quot;), based on Jean Cocteau&#x27;s 1930 play of the same name. During the 1980s and early 1990s, Norman produced numerous award-winning recordings, and many of her performances were televised. In addition to opera, many of Norman&#x27;s recordings and performances during this time focused on art songs, lieder, oratorios, and orchestral works. Her interpretation of the &quot;Four Last Songs&quot; is especially acclaimed, as &quot;the tonal qualities of her voice were ideal for these final works of the great Romantic German lieder tradition&quot;.

Norman also performed Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Gurre-Lieder&quot; and his one-woman opera &quot;Erwartung&quot;. In 1989, she appeared at the Metropolitan Opera for a performance of &quot;Erwartung&quot; that marked the company&#x27;s first single-character production. It was presented in a double bill with Bartók&#x27;s &quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle&quot;, with Norman playing Judith. Both operas were broadcast nationally. That same year, she was the featured soloist with Zubin Mehta and the New York Philharmonic in the opening concert of its 148th season, which PBS telecast live. She performed at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre opening and gave a recital at the National Theater and Concert Hall in Taipei.

Also in 1989, Norman was invited to sing the French national anthem, &quot;La Marseillaise,&quot; to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution on July 14. Her rendition was delivered at the Place de la Concorde in Paris, in a costume designed by Azzedine Alaïa as part of an elaborate pageant orchestrated by avant-garde designer Jean-Paul Goude. This event was the inspiration that led the South African poet Lawrence Mduduzi Ndlovu to write a poem titled &quot;I Shall Be Heard&quot; dedicated to Norman. The poem appears in Ndlovu&#x27;s book of poems &quot;In Quiet Realm&quot;, the foreword to which is penned by Norman.

=== Later life (1990–2019) ===

From the early 1990s, Norman lived in Croton-on-Hudson, New York, in a secluded estate known as &quot;The White Gates&quot;, which was previously owned by television personality Allen Funt. She performed at Tchaikovsky&#x27;s 150th Birthday Gala in Leningrad and appeared at the Lyric Opera of Chicago in the title role of Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Alceste&quot; in 1990. She sang American spirituals with soprano Kathleen Battle at Carnegie Hall that year. The following year, she performed in a concert recorded live with Lawrence Foster and the Lyon Opera Orchestra at Notre-Dame de Paris. Norman sang Jocasta in Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Oedipus rex&quot; at the opening operatic production at the new Saito Kinen Festival in the Japanese Alps near Matsumoto in 1992. The following year, she sang the title role in the Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s production of &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot;. In 1994, Norman sang at the funeral of former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. She was again the featured soloist with the New York Philharmonic, then conducted by Kurt Masur, in a gala concert telecast for the opening of the orchestra&#x27;s 153rd season in 1995. She gave a highly lauded performance as the title character of Janáček&#x27;s &quot;The Makropulos Affair&quot; when it was first performed at the Met in 1996.

Norman performed at the 1996 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in Atlanta, singing &quot;Faster, Higher, Stronger&quot;. In January 1997, she performed at the second inauguration of U.S. President Bill Clinton, singing, &quot;Oh freedom!&quot;. In 1998, she performed a recital at Carnegie Hall incorporating sacred music by Duke Ellington, scored for jazz combo, string quartet and piano. She sang Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot;, with the Boston Symphony Orchestra conducted by Seiji Ozawa. A Christmas television program was filmed in her home town. A spring recital tour in 1999 included performances in Tel Aviv. In the following season, she appeared at the Salzburg Festival.

In 1999, Norman collaborated with choreographer-dancer Bill T. Jones in a project for New York City&#x27;s Lincoln Center, called &quot;How! Do! We! Do!&quot; In 2000, she released an album, &quot;I Was Born in Love with You&quot;, featuring the songs of Michel Legrand. The recording, reviewed as a jazz crossover project, featured Legrand on piano, Ron Carter on bass, and Grady Tate on drums. In February and March 2001, Norman was featured at Carnegie Hall in a three-part concert series. With James Levine as her pianist, the concerts were a significant arts event, replete with an 80-page program booklet featuring a newly commissioned watercolor portrait of Norman by David Hockney. In 2002, Norman performed at the opening of Singapore&#x27;s Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay.

On June 28, 2001, Norman and Kathleen Battle performed &quot;Mythodea&quot; by Vangelis at the Temple of Olympian Zeus in Athens, Greece. On March 11, 2002, Norman performed &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; at a service unveiling two monumental columns of light at the site of the former World Trade Center, as a memorial for the victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York City. In 2002, she returned to Augusta to announce that she would fund a pilot school of the arts for children in Richmond County. Classes commenced at St. John United Methodist Church in the fall of 2003. In November 2004, a documentary about Norman&#x27;s life and work was directed by André Heller and as director of photography, documenting her music as well as political and social issues. In 2006, Norman collaborated with the modern dance choreographer Trey McIntyre for a special performance during the summer at the Vail Dance Festival.

In 2003, the Rachel Longstreet Foundation and Norman partnered to open the Jessye Norman School of the Arts, a tuition-free performing arts after-school program for economically disadvantaged students in Augusta, Georgia. Norman was actively involved in the program, including fundraisers for its benefit.

In March 2009, Norman curated &quot;Honor!&quot;, a celebration of the African-American cultural legacy. The festival honored African-American trailblazers and artists with concerts, recitals, lectures, panel discussions, and exhibitions hosted by Carnegie Hall, the Apollo Theater, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, and other sites around New York City.
Norman served on the boards of directors for Carnegie Hall, City-Meals-on-Wheels in New York City, the Dance Theatre of Harlem, the New York Botanical Garden, the New York Public Library, National Music Foundation, and the Elton John AIDS Foundation.

<text>is one of the largest worldwide &quot;sōgō shōsha&quot; general trading companies, and is a diversified corporation. The company was incorporated in 1919 and is a member company of the Sumitomo Group.

It is listed on three Japanese stock exchanges (Tokyo, Nagoya and Fukuoka) and is a constituent of the TOPIX and Nikkei 225 stock indices. Today, the company is one of the top three &quot;sōgō shōsha&quot; companies in the world.

==History==
The Sumitomo Group, of which Sumitomo Corporation is a key member, dates to the 17th century establishment of a book and medicine shop in Kyoto by Masatomo Sumitomo. Sumitomo&#x27;s brother-in-law Riemon Soga developed a technology to extract silver from copper, and Soga&#x27;s son (who married Sumitomo&#x27;s daughter) Tomomochi Sumitomo expanded this smelting business to Osaka. From this start, the Sumitomo family expanded its business into copper mining (the Besshi copper mine), followed by textiles, sugar and medicine trading.

The Sumitomo family was close to the Tokugawa shogunate throughout the Edo period. During the 1860s, this relationship became a liability for the firm as the Tokugawa clan warred with rivals in western Japan. Following the Tokugawas&#x27; defeat, Sumitomo was almost ruined and under pressure to sell the Besshi mine, which by that point was nearly unworkable. However, Sumitomo kept the mine and improved its output through adoption of new Western techniques. During the rapid westernization of Japan in ensuing decades, Sumitomo started various new trading, manufacturing and financing businesses, becoming one of the major &quot;zaibatsu&quot; of early 20th century Japan.

Sumitomo Corporation was incorporated in December 1919 as The Osaka North Harbour Co., Ltd. to engage in real estate management, land reclamation, land grading, harbor repair construction and related work in the Osaka northern harbor region. In 1944, the company merged with Sumitomo Building Co., Ltd. (established August 1923; capital stock 6.5 million yen) to form Sumitomo Building and Real Estate Co., Ltd.

Sumitomo was integral to Imperial Japan&#x27;s war machine during World War II, but the war destroyed most of Sumitomo&#x27;s industrial infrastructure within Japan. The ensuing Allied occupation led to the forced breakup of the largest Japanese companies, including Sumitomo, and transfer of Japanese industrial assets as part of reparations. Sumitomo Building transitioned to general trading, looking to handle products from Japan&#x27;s major manufacturing firms in various industries, and changed its name to Nippon Engineering Co., Ltd. (&quot;Nihon Kensetsu Sangyo Kaisha&quot;), starting a new existence as a general trading firm with a sales staff of just 32 people. The firm listed its shares on the Osaka, Tokyo and Nagoya Stock Exchanges in 1949.

As regulations on large companies were relaxed in the 1950s, Nippon Engineering resumed closer relations with other Sumitomo Group companies through the &quot;White Water Club&quot; (&quot;Hakusui-kai&quot;), a coordinating meeting of company presidents. The company began to grow overseas in the 1950s, starting business in Mumbai in 1950 and in New York City in 1952. It changed its name to Sumitomo Shoji Kaisha, Ltd. in 1952. By the 1960s Sumitomo officially aimed to be one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; general trading companies, alongside Mitsubishi and Mitsui. In 1970, Sumitomo established a second head office in Tokyo and merged with Sogo Boeki Co., Ltd. Sumitomo adopted its current English name, Sumitomo Corporation, in 1978. The company&#x27;s transactional volume increased by a factor of ten from 1955 to 1965, and again by a factor of ten from 1965 to 1975. Like its &quot;zaibatsu&quot; cohorts Mitsubishi and Mitsui, Sumitomo established a &quot;keiretsu&quot; business group centered on itself and Sumitomo Bank.

Sumitomo&#x27;s strategy focused on natural resources through 2014, when the company booked hundreds of billions of yen in losses on tight oil (shale oil) and other energy-related investments. The company&#x27;s president, Kuniharu Nakamura, attributed these losses to both adverse market factors and Sumitomo&#x27;s relative inexperience in the field. As a result of these setbacks, Sumitomo was overtaken by Itochu as Japan&#x27;s third-largest general trading company. Sumitomo announced in 2015 that it would refocus its business on the automotive and infrastructure industries and other non-resource businesses.

Berkshire Hathaway acquired over 5% of the stock in the company, along with four other Japanese trading houses, over the 12-month period ending in August 2020.

<doc id="674842" wikidata="Q6407883" url="?curid=674842" title="Killone Abbey">
<text>Killone Abbey () is a former nunnery located on the grounds of Newhall Estate in County Clare, Ireland. The abbey was founded in 1190 by Donal Mór O&#x27;Brien, King of Thomond and Munster (pre-16th century Clare was called Thomond), who placed there a sisterhood of the order of Saint Augustin. It was a prominent house of Canonesses Regular and one of the major female monastic institutions in Gaelic Ireland.

It became closely associated with the O&#x27;Brien dynasty, one of the leading Gaelic noble families in medieval Ireland, and many of its abbesses were drawn from their ranks. Among them was Slaney O&#x27;Brien (d. 1260), the daughter of Carbreagh, King of Thomond, who renounced her royal status and worldly possessions to take up the role of abbess. In an era marked by political unrest and violence, the abbey provided the happiest, as well as safest asylum for female virtue.She was described in the Irish annals as &quot;&quot;the most pious, most charitable, and most generous woman in all Munster&quot; &quot;The last abbess, Lady Honora O&#x27;Brien, daughter of Murrough O&#x27;Brien, the 1st Earl of Thomond, played a significant role in the abbey&#x27;s later history. Following the suppression of monastic houses in 1540, Lady Honora married Sir Roger O&#x27;Shaughnessy and became heiress to Newhall and Killone. Their marriage, which required papal dispensation, occurred after the birth of their three eldest children.

By 1617, the abbey was recorded as being in ruins. Today, its remains are located on land used for grazing cattle within the grounds of Newhall House and Estate. The ruins include substantial portions of the abbey church and a crypt. A narrow stone stairway, situated between the altar and the east window, leads to a ledge atop the south wall of the church, offering views of the surrounding grounds.

The site is widely regarded for its serene atmosphere, spiritual significance, and natural beauty, making it a cherished landmark in the local area.

== Saint John&#x27;s Holy Well ==
Also located on the grounds of Newhall Estate is Holy Well of Saint John the Baptist, known as &quot;Tobar Eoin&quot; in Irish, which has long been a site of religious significance. The well’s origins date back to pre-Christian times when it is believed to have been a pagan site of offerings to Jun of Babylon with summer festivals.

The well is believed to have healing properties and has served as a place of pilgrimage for centuries. It features remnants of historical stone structures and a natural spring. Local folklore and historical records indicate that the well was visited for blessings and cures, particularly during the feast day of Saint John. Its enduring presence continues to attract visitors seeking spiritual reflection and healing.

The well, adorned with inscriptions, some dating back to 1600, remains a site of veneration and a tangible connection to the spiritual practices of earlier generations. Its enduring presence reflects the reverence and affection carried by local traditions for this historic site.

Lord Walter Fitzgerald (the fourth son of Charles, Duke of Leinster) visited the site in 1899 and documented its history in &quot;Inscriptions at St. John’s Well, Killone Abbey, County Clare&quot; for the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland.

Today, the site remains a focal point of local religious tradition, with an annual outdoor Mass held in June by the local parish, maintaining its role as a place of veneration and community gathering.

== Access ==
The abbey and graveyard is privately owned, part of Newhall Estate, owned by the Commane family, and as protected sites under national monument legislation, guardianship is vested in the Office of Public Works. As it is private land, access is available with the owner&#x27;s permission. Killone Abbey is linked to Clare Abbey by the Pilgrim&#x27;s Path, a footpath through Ballybeg forrest.

<doc id="674846" wikidata="Q347711" url="?curid=674846" title="Anthony Quayle">
<text>Sir John Anthony Quayle (7 September 1913 – 20 October 1989) was a British actor, theatre director and novelist. He was nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe for his supporting role as Thomas Wolsey in the film &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot; (1969). He also played important roles in such major studio productions as &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; (1961), &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962), &quot;The Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; (1964), &quot;Operation Crossbow&quot; (1965), &quot;QB VII&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Eagle Has Landed&quot; (1976). Quayle was knighted in the 1985 New Years Honours List.

==Early life==
Quayle was born on 7 September 1913 at 2 Delamere Road, Ainsdale, Southport, Lancashire, to solicitor Arthur Quayle, of a Manx family, and Esther Kate Quayle ( Overton).

He was educated at Abberley Hall School, a preparatory school in Abberley, Worcestershire, and at Rugby School, then an all-boys independent boarding school. He trained for one year at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. His first professional stage appearance was in &quot;The Ghost Train&quot; at the Q Theatre, while on holiday from RADA. After appearing in music hall, he joined the Old Vic in 1932.

==Second World War service==
During the Second World War, he served in the Royal Artillery. Having joined as a gunner (i.e. private), he attended the 70th Coast Defence Training Regiment and was commissioned second lieutenant on 7 January 1940. He was made one of the area commanders of the Auxiliary Units in Northumberland. The units were &quot;stay-behind forces&quot; in case of a German invasion.

Later Quayle joined the Special Operations Executive (SOE) and served as a liaison officer with the partisans in Albania. Reportedly, his service with the SOE seriously affected him and he never felt comfortable talking about it. He described his experiences in a fictional form in &quot;Eight Hours from England&quot;.

He was an aide to the Governor of Gibraltar at the time of the air crash of General Władysław Sikorski&#x27;s aircraft on 4 July 1943. He wrote of his Gibraltar experience in his second novel &quot;On Such a Night&quot;, published by Heinemann.

By the end of the war, he held the rank of temporary major. In May 1946, it was published that he had been mentioned in despatches &quot;in recognition of gallant and distinguished services in the Mediterranean Theatre&quot;.

==Career==
===Theatre===
From 1948 to 1956 Quayle directed at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, and laid the foundations for the creation of the Royal Shakespeare Company. His own Shakespearian roles included Falstaff, Othello, Benedick in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing,&quot; Henry VIII and Aaron in &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; with Laurence Olivier; he played Mosca in Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Volpone&quot;; and he also appeared in contemporary plays. He played the role of Moses in Christopher Fry&#x27;s play &quot;The Firstborn&quot;, in a production starring opposite Katharine Cornell. He also made an LP with Cornell, in which he played the role of poet Robert Browning in &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot;.

Quayle made his Broadway debut in &quot;The Country Wife&quot; in 1936. Thirty-four years later, he won critical acclaim for his starring role in the highly successful Anthony Shaffer play &quot;Sleuth&quot;, which earned him a Drama Desk Award.

Quayle played James Tyrone in the first UK production of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey Into Night&quot; (Globe Theatre, London, 1958).

Quayle was artist-in-residence at the University of Tennessee in the mid-70s. He came to Knoxville in spring 1974, through a partnership with the Kennedy Center, starring in Henry Denker&#x27;s &quot;The Headhunters&quot;, which rehearsed and opened at the Clarence Brown Theatre and then moved on to the Kennedy Center&#x27;s Eisenhower Theatre. Quayle was appointed as professor in theatre in 1974. He taught classes as an artist in residence and served as artistic director of the Clarence Brown Company—a professional theatre company in residence at UT. He played in &quot;Everyman&quot; the same year.

In 1984, he founded Compass Theatre Company, that he inaugurated with a tour of &quot;The Clandestine Marriage&quot;, directing and playing the part of Lord Ogleby. This production had a run at the Albery Theatre, London. With the same company he subsequently toured with a number of other plays, including &quot;Saint Joan&quot;, &quot;Dandy Dick&quot; and &quot;King Lear&quot; with himself in the title role.

===Film and Television===

His first film role was an uncredited brief appearance as an Italian wigmaker in &quot;Pygmalion&quot; (1938) – later film roles included parts in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Wrong Man&quot;, Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger&#x27;s &quot;The Battle of the River Plate&quot; (both 1956), &quot;Ice Cold in Alex&quot; (1958), &quot;Tarzan&#x27;s Greatest Adventure&quot; (1959), &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; (1961), &quot;H.M.S. Defiant&quot;, David Lean&#x27;s &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (both 1962) and &quot;The Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; (1964). He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Cardinal Wolsey in &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot; (1969).

Often cast as the decent British officer, Quayle drew upon his wartime experiences, bringing a degree of authenticity to the parts absent from the performances of some non-combatant stars. One of his best friends from his days at the Old Vic was fellow actor Alec Guinness, who appeared in several films with him. He was also a close friend of Jack Hawkins and Jack Gwillim; all four actors appeared in &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;.

Television appearances include the &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; episode &quot;The Scent of Fear&quot; (1959) for ITV, the title role in the drama series &quot;Strange Report&quot; (ITC, 1969) and as French General Villers in the television film adaptation of &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; (1988). He starred in the miniseries &quot;Masada&quot; (1981) as Rubrius Gallius. Also he narrated the BBC drama serial &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot; (1970), and the acclaimed aviation documentary series &quot;Reaching for the Skies&quot; (1988). Quayle also starred in the &#x27;Last Bottle in The World&#x27; episode of Tales of the Unexpected (TV series)

==Personal life==
Quayle married twice. His first wife was the actress Hermione Hannen (1913–1983), to whom he was married from 1935 to 1941. In 1947, he married American-born actress Dorothy Hyson (1914–1996), known as &quot;Dot&quot; to family and friends. He and Dorothy had two daughters, Jenny and Rosanna, and a son, Christopher.

Quayle died at his home in Chelsea from liver cancer on 20 October 1989.

<text>James Alvin Palmer (born October 15, 1945) is an American former professional baseball pitcher who played 19 years in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Baltimore Orioles (1965–1967, 1969–1984). Palmer was the winningest MLB pitcher in the 1970s, totaling 186 wins. He also won at least 20 games in eight different seasons and won three Cy Young Awards and four Gold Gloves during the decade. His 268 Orioles victories are the most in team history. A six-time American League (AL) All-Star, he was also one of the rare pitchers who never allowed a grand slam in any major league contest.

Palmer appeared in the postseason eight times and was a vital member of three World Series Champions, six AL pennant winners and seven Eastern Division titleholders. He is the only pitcher in history to earn a win in a World Series game in three different decades. He is also the youngest to pitch a complete-game shutout in a World Series, doing so nine days before his 21st birthday in 1966, in which he defeated Sandy Koufax in Koufax&#x27;s last appearance. He was one of the starters on the last rotation to feature four 20-game winners in a single season in 1971. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1990 in his first year of eligibility.

Since his retirement as an active player in 1984, Palmer has worked as a color commentator on telecasts of MLB games for ABC and ESPN and for the Orioles on Home Team Sports (HTS), Comcast SportsNet (CSN) Mid-Atlantic and the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN). He has also been a popular spokesman, most famously for Jockey International for almost 20 years. He was nicknamed &quot;Cakes&quot; in the 1960s because of his habit of eating pancakes for breakfast on the days he pitched.

==Early life==
James Alvin Palmer was born in Manhattan, New York City, on October 15, 1945. Research conducted by his third wife Susan in 2017 revealed that his biological father and mother were Michael Joseph Geheran and Mary Ann Moroney, both Irish immigrants from Counties Leitrim and Clare, respectively. Joe was a married 41-year-old man about town, while Mary Ann was an unmarried 37-year-old domestic worker for the Feinstein family which was prominent in the garment industry. Moroney gave up her infant for adoption and concealed information in the New York City birth registry, where Palmer is listed as Baby Boy Kennedy, whose father was Maroney and mother was Kennedy.

Maroney was the incorrect spelling of her surname as listed when she registered at Ellis Island, while Kennedy was her sister Katharine&#x27;s married name. Moroney eventually married John Lane and the couple had a daughter, Patricia, Palmer&#x27;s biological half-sister, who died of leukemia at age 40 in 1987. As of May 2018, the Palmers were still searching for Patricia Lane&#x27;s daughter, whose married name is Kimberly Hughes and who would be Jim Palmer&#x27;s half-niece. Geheran died in 1959 and Moroney died in 1979.

Two days after his birth, Palmer was adopted by Moe Wiesen and his wife Polly, a wealthy Manhattan dress designer and a boutique owner, respectively, who lived on Park Avenue. His sister Bonnie was also adopted by the Wiesens. The family&#x27;s butler taught the young Jim to throw a baseball in Central Park. After his adoptive father died of a heart attack in 1955, the nine-year-old Jim, his mother and his sister moved to Beverly Hills, California, where he began playing in youth-league baseball. In 1956, his mother married actor Max Palmer, but Jim continued to go under the name Jim Wiesen until a year later. At a Little League banquet, just before being presented with an award, he asked the coaches to identify him as &quot;James Alvin Palmer.&quot; &quot;Through all these years, that night was the highlight of my entire life,&quot; Max recalled. Max was a character actor and there were two men who shared that name who worked in show business during similar time periods. The Max who was Jim&#x27;s second dad worked mostly on TV on such programs as &quot;Dragnet&quot;, &quot;Bat Masterson&quot; and &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour&quot;. He was Jewish, and he also earned a living by selling shoes. The other Max Palmer, often erroneously credited as Jim&#x27;s father, worked in several movies as a monster. He was 8&#x27;2&quot; tall and later became a professional wrestler and eventually a Christian evangelist.

Jim played baseball for the Beverly Hills Yankees, where he pitched and also hit home runs as an outfielder. The family eventually moved to Scottsdale, Arizona, where Jim played baseball, basketball, and football at Scottsdale High School. He earned All-State honors in each of these sports, also graduating with a 3.4 grade-point average in 1963. Palmer also showed his prowess at American Legion Baseball. The University of Southern California, UCLA, and Arizona State University each offered him full scholarships; Stanford University offered a partial scholarship as well.

Bobby Winkles of Arizona State suggested that Palmer get more experience playing collegiate summer baseball, so Palmer went to South Dakota to join the Winner Pheasants of the Basin League. The team advanced all the way to the league finals, and Palmer caught the attention of Baltimore Orioles scout Harry Dalton while pitching in the second game of the championship. According to Palmer, 13 Major League Baseball (MLB) teams recruited him after the season wrapped up, but Jim Russo (the scout who also signed Dave McNally and Boog Powell) and Jim Wilson of the Orioles made the best impression on his parents with their polite manners. Palmer signed with Baltimore for $50,000.

==Career in baseball==
===1960s===
A high-kicking pitcher known for an exceptionally smooth delivery, Palmer picked up his first major-league win on May 16, , beating the Yankees in relief at home. He hit the first of his three career major-league home runs, a two-run shot, in the fourth inning of that game, off Yankees starter Jim Bouton. Palmer finished the season with a 5–4 record. In , Palmer joined the starting rotation. Baltimore won the pennant behind Frank Robinson&#x27;s MVP and Triple Crown season. Palmer won his final game, against the Kansas City Athletics, to clinch the AL pennant. In Game 2 of that World Series, at Dodger Stadium, he became the youngest pitcher (20 years, 11 months) to pitch a shutout, defeating the defending world champion Dodgers 6–0. The underdog Orioles swept the series over a Los Angeles team that featured Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale and Claude Osteen. The shutout was part of a World Series record-setting consecutive shutout innings by Orioles pitchers. The Dodgers&#x27; last run was against Moe Drabowsky in the third inning of Game 1. Palmer, Wally Bunker and Dave McNally pitched shutouts in the next three games.

During the next two seasons, Palmer struggled with arm injuries. He had injured his arm in 1966 while using a paint roller in his new house in Baltimore. Cortisone injections allowed him to pitch through the rest of the season and the World Series, but in 1967, his arm continued to feel heavy. He threw a one-hit game against the New York Yankees on May 12 but was sent to the minor leagues after a poor start against the Boston Red Sox five days later. While trying to make it back with the Rochester Red Wings in Rochester, New York, Palmer surrendered the only grand slam in his entire professional career, which was hit by the Buffalo Bisons&#x27; Johnny Bench. He only pitched three more games for the Orioles in 1967. In 1968, he was limited to 10 minor league games, with no appearances for the Orioles. The outlook on his career was so bleak, Palmer considered quitting baseball to attend college or trying to be a position player. He had been placed on waivers in September 1968 and was left unprotected for the Kansas City Royals and Seattle Pilots in the expansion draft one month later, but was not claimed. After he pitched for an Instructional League team, the Orioles sent him to pitch for the Santurce Crabbers in the Puerto Rican Winter League. Before he left for Santurce, however, Palmer attended a Baltimore Bullets game and sat next to Marvin Foxman, a pharmaceutical representative who suggested he try Indocin. In Santurce, Palmer&#x27;s arm stopped hurting, and his fastball began hitting 95 mph again. &quot;It was a miracle as far as I was concerned,&quot; said Palmer.

Palmer returned healthy in 1969, rejoining an Orioles rotation that included 20-game winners Dave McNally and Mike Cuellar. He missed July with a six-week stint on the disabled list, but it was for a torn back muscle, not because of arm trouble. That August 13, Palmer threw a no-hitter against Oakland, just four days after coming off the disabled list. It was the only no-hitter of his career. He finished the season with a mark of 16–4, 123 strikeouts, a 2.34 ERA, and .800 winning percentage. The heavily favored Orioles were beaten in the 1969 World Series by the New York Mets with Palmer taking the loss in Game 3.

===1970s===
In , Cuellar went 24–8, McNally 24–9, Palmer 20–10 and in the trio went 20–9, 21–5 and 20–9, respectively, with Pat Dobson going 20–8. Only one other team in MLB history, the Chicago White Sox, has had four 20-game winners. Palmer won 21 games in and went 22–9, 158, 2.40 in , walking off with his first Cy Young Award. His success was interrupted in when his arm started giving him trouble in spring training. Eventually, he was down for eight weeks with elbow problems. Palmer had lost seven consecutive games by the time he went on the disabled list on June 20. He was diagnosed with an ulnar nerve injury and orthopedic surgeon Robert Kerlan prescribed rest, hot and cold water therapy and medication. Surgery was considered but Palmer&#x27;s pain lessened and he was able to return to pitch in August. He finished 7–12.

Palmer was at his peak again in , winning 23 games, throwing 10 shutouts (allowing just 44 hits in those games), and fashioning a 2.09 ERA—all tops in the American League. He completed 25 games, even saved one, and limited opposing hitters to a .216 batting average. On July 28, 1976, he received a fine from AL president Lee MacPhail after hitting Mickey Rivers with a pitch the day before. Palmer said it was in retaliation for Dock Ellis hitting Reggie Jackson with a pitch earlier in the game then complained when Ellis (who did not admit to throwing at Jackson) was not fined. Palmer won his second Cy Young Award, and repeated his feat in (22–13, 2.51). During the latter year, he won the first of four consecutive Gold Glove Awards. (Jim Kaat, who had won the award 14 consecutive seasons, moved to the National League, where he won the award that year and in .)
After making $185,000 in 1976, Palmer hoped for a raise in 1977. The Orioles offered $200,000 initially but Palmer wanted $275,000. They finally agreed on a $260,000 salary, with a bonus for a &quot;significant contribution.&quot; In 1977 and 1978, Palmer won 20 and 21 games, respectively. Despite the 20 wins in 1977, the Orioles almost refused to give him a bonus. After the Major League Baseball Players Association filed a grievance in Palmer&#x27;s dispute and threatened to go to arbitration (which likely would have resulted in Palmer becoming a free agent), GM Hank Peters relented and gave him the bonus. During the period spanning 1970 to 1978, Palmer had won 20 games in every season except for 1974. During those eight 20-win seasons, he pitched between and 319 innings per year, leading the league in innings pitched four times and earned run average twice. During that span, he threw between 17 and 25 complete games each year. Frustrated that pitchers who had become free agents like Vida Blue and Bert Blyleven were making more money than he in 1979, Palmer told a reporter for the &quot;St. Paul Pioneer Press&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m going to aggravate [the Orioles] until they trade me.&quot; Manager Earl Weaver responded by pinning a note to his locker that said, &quot;Happy Father&#x27;s Day. Now grow up.&quot; &quot;He&#x27;s right he&#x27;s underpaid...He&#x27;s worth a million dollars when he&#x27;s pitching but he signed for $260,000.&quot; Palmer eventually got over being discontent and the team won the AL pennant. Weaver tabbed Palmer to start Game 1 of the ALCS against the Angels, although Palmer asked him to start Mike Flanagan, the 1979 Cy Young Award winner, instead, Weaver valued Palmer&#x27;s experience. Matched up against Ryan, Palmer allowed three runs in nine innings, taking a no-decision as he left with the game tied. The Orioles won in the 10th on a John Lowenstein home run and won the series 3–1.

===1980s===
From 1980 through 1985, Palmer was hampered by arm fatigue and myriad minor injuries. Even so, he brought a stabilizing veteran presence to the pitching staff. In 1981, Palmer got into a feud with Doug DeCinces after DeCinces missed a line drive hit by Alan Trammell in a game against the Tigers. According to DeCinces, Palmer &quot;was cussing me out and throwing his hands in the air&quot; after the play. &quot;Those balls have to be caught,&quot; Palmer told a paper. &quot;Doug is reluctant to get in front of a ball.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;d like to know where Jim Palmer gets off criticizing others,&quot; DeCinces responded. &quot;Ask anybody–they&#x27;re all sick of it. We&#x27;re a twenty-four man team–and one prima donna. He thinks it&#x27;s always someone else&#x27;s fault.&quot; The feud simmered until June, when Weaver said, &quot;I see no cause for concern. The third baseman wants the pitcher to do a little better and the pitcher wants the third baseman to do a little better. I hope we can all do better and kiss and make up...The judge gave me custody of both of them.&quot; Palmer ultimately blamed Brooks Robinson for the dispute: &quot;If Brooks hadn&#x27;t been the best third-baseman of all time, the rest of the Orioles wouldn&#x27;t have taken it for granted that any ball hit anywhere within the same county as Brooks would be judged perfectly, fielded perfectly, and thrown perfectly, nailing (perfectly) what seemed like every single opposing batter.&quot;

After Palmer posted a 6.84 ERA in five starts, GM Hank Peters announced that &quot;Palmer is never, ever, ever going to start another game in an Orioles uniform. I&#x27;ve had it.&quot; Weaver moved Palmer to the bullpen, but with the team needing another starter, he put Palmer back in the rotation in June. Shortly thereafter, Palmer went on an 11-game winning streak.

Palmer&#x27;s final major-league victory was noteworthy: pitching in relief of Mike Flanagan in the third game of the 1983 World Series, he faced the Phillies&#x27; celebrity-studded batting order and gave up no runs in a close Oriole win.

The 17 years between Palmer&#x27;s first World Series win in 1966 and the 1983 win is the longest period of time between first and last pitching victories in the World Series for an individual pitcher in major league history. He also became the only pitcher in major league baseball history to have won World Series games in three decades. Also, Palmer became the only player in Orioles history to appear in all six (, , , , , ) of their World Series appearances to date.

Palmer was the only Orioles player on the 1983 championship team to have previously won a World Series. He retired after being released by Baltimore during the season. He retired with a 268–152 win–loss record and a 2.86 ERA. Palmer was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1990, his first year of eligibility.

===Early broadcasting career===
While still an active player, Palmer did color commentary for ABC for their coverage of the 1978, 1980 and 1982 American League Championship Series, 1981 American League Division Series between Oakland and Kansas City, and the 1981 World Series.

From to , Palmer formed an announcing team with Al Michaels and Tim McCarver at ABC. Palmer announced the 1985 World Series, where he was supposed to team with Michaels and Howard Cosell, whom Palmer had worked with on the previous year&#x27;s ALCS. McCarver replaced Cosell for the World Series at the last minute after Cosell released a book (&quot;I Never Played the Game&quot;) that was critical of the ABC Sports team. The team of Palmer, Michaels and McCarver would subsequently go on to call the 1986 All-Star Game (that year, Palmer worked with Michaels on the ALCS while McCarver teamed with Keith Jackson on ABC&#x27;s coverage of the National League Championship Series), the 1987 World Series, and 1988 All-Star Game as well as that year&#x27;s NLCS.

Palmer was present at San Francisco&#x27;s Candlestick Park on October 17, , when the Loma Prieta earthquake hit prior to Game 3 of the World Series. After the 1989 season, ABC lost its contract to broadcast baseball to CBS. Palmer had earned $350,000 from ABC that year for appearing on around ten regular season broadcasts and making a few postseason appearances.

In 1990, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Palmer was thinking of pursuing work as a major league manager. Instead, Palmer worked as an analyst for ESPN and as a broadcaster for Orioles games on their local telecasts over WMAR-TV and Home Team Sports.

===Comeback attempt===
In , Palmer attempted a comeback with the Orioles. He explained in his 1996 book, &quot;I wanted to see if I could be like Nolan Ryan was to the game or what George Blanda was to football.&quot; ESPN, which was trying to cut expenses, had asked him to take a pay cut and to sign a three-year contract. Palmer said he would sign a one-year contract for less pay, but ESPN refused. &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t be here today if the broadcasting climate had been more to my liking. That was really my prime motivation, the fact that I no longer had that obligation&quot;, Palmer said during spring training.

Covering Palmer&#x27;s spring training workouts, Richard Hoffer of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; said that Palmer&#x27;s comeback was not entirely about money. He wrote that &quot;it is fair to suspect that a certain vanity is involved.&quot; Hoffer said that Palmer &quot;has failed to excite either ridicule or astonishment. He&#x27;s in fabulous condition, no question. But no matter whom he lines up with on the row of practice mounds, there is more pop in the gloves of catchers other than his.&quot; &quot;I couldn&#x27;t throw ninety-five miles an hour anymore,&quot; Palmer later reflected. &quot;The best I could do was eighty.&quot;

While working out at the University of Miami during his comeback attempt, Palmer was approached by Miami assistant coach Lazaro Collazo. Collazo reportedly told him, &quot;You&#x27;ll never get into the Hall of Fame with those mechanics.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m already in the Hall of Fame&quot;, Palmer replied. To help Palmer&#x27;s pitching motion, Collazo and Palmer completed unusual drills that involved Palmer placing a knee or foot on a chair as he tossed the ball.

After giving up five hits and two runs in two innings of a spring training game, he retired permanently. Palmer said that he tore his hamstring while warming up for the game, commenting, &quot;I&#x27;m not saying I wouldn&#x27;t like to continue, but I can&#x27;t&quot;, he said. &quot;I heard something pop in my leg yesterday. It wasn&#x27;t a nice sound. I don&#x27;t know what that means, but I think it&#x27;s going to play havoc with my tennis game.&quot;

===Return to broadcasting===
From to , Palmer returned to ABC (this time, via a revenue-sharing joint venture between Major League Baseball, ABC and NBC called The Baseball Network) to once again broadcast with Tim McCarver and Al Michaels. In 1995, the reunited team of Palmer, McCarver and Michaels would call the All-Star Game, Game 3 of that NLDS between Cincinnati and Los Angeles, Game 4 of the NLDS between Atlanta and Colorado, Games 1–2 of the NLCS, and Games 1, 4–5 of the World Series. Palmer, McCarver and Michaels were also intended to call the previous year&#x27;s World Series for ABC, but were denied the opportunity when the entire postseason was canceled due to a strike. He is currently a color commentator on MASN&#x27;s television broadcasts of Oriole games.

In July 2012, Palmer put up for auction his three Cy Young Award trophies and two of his four Gold Glove Awards. &quot;At this point in my life, I would rather concern myself with the education of my grandchildren&quot;, he said. Palmer also noted that his autistic teenage stepson would require special care and that &quot;my priorities have changed.&quot; Palmer had put up for auction one of his Cy Young Award trophies on behalf of a fundraising event for cystic fibrosis in years past, although he stated the winning bidder &quot;had paid $39,000 for that and never ever took it. It was for the cause.&quot;

===Legacy===

Palmer is the only pitcher in major-league history to win World Series games in three decades (1960s, 1970s, and 1980s). During his 19-year major league career of 575 games (including 17 postseason games), he never surrendered a grand slam, nor did he ever allow back-to-back homers. Palmer&#x27;s career earned run average (2.856) is the third-lowest among starting pitchers whose careers began after the advent of the live-ball era in 1920. In six ALCS and six World Series, he posted an 8–3 record with 90 strikeouts, and an ERA of 2.61 and two shutouts in 17 games.

He was a mainstay in the rotation during Baltimore&#x27;s six pennant-winning teams in the 1960s (1966 and 1969), 1970s (1970, 1971 and 1979) and 1980s (1983). With the passing of Mike Cuellar in 2010, Palmer became the last surviving member of the 1971 Baltimore starting rotation that included four 20-game winners. Palmer won spots on six All-Star teams, received four Gold Glove Awards and won three Cy Young Awards. He led the league in ERA twice and in wins three times.

Sometimes, Palmer would shift fielders around during games. He never meddled with the best fielders, such as the Robinsons or Paul Blair, but he would do so for less experienced players. &quot;They might not know...that if they&#x27;re playing a step or two to the opposite field and you&#x27;re behind the batter two balls and no strikes...and you have a big lead...you&#x27;re probably going to take a little off the pitch...and the fielders have to know to shift a couple of steps and play for the batter to pull.&quot;

In , he ranked No. 64 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.

==Endorsements==

During the late 1970s and 1980s, Palmer was a spokesman and underwear model for Jockey brand men&#x27;s briefs. He appeared in the company&#x27;s national print and television advertisements as well as on billboards at Times Square in New York City and other major cities. He donated all proceeds from the sale of his underwear poster to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.

From 1992 until 1999, he was frequently seen on television throughout the United States in commercials for The Money Store, a national home equity and mortgage lender. He has periodically appeared in ads and commercials for vitamins and other health-related products. Palmer also represents Cosamin DS, a joint health supplement made by Nutramax Laboratories in Edgewood, Maryland.

He was also the spokesperson for Nationwide Motors Corp., which is a regional chain of car dealerships located in the Middle Atlantic region. He is currently a spokesman for the national &quot;Strike Out High Cholesterol&quot; campaign. Additionally, Palmer serves as a member of the advisory board of the Baseball Assistance Team, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to helping former Major League, Minor League, and Negro league players through financial and medical difficulties.

==Personal life==

Shortly after graduating from high school in 1963, Palmer married the former Susan Ryan in 1964. He has two daughters with Ryan, named Jamie and Kelly. Ryan was not a huge baseball fan, as Palmer recalled: &quot;She used to bring her knitting and/or a friend, who usually liked baseball even less, to the games.&quot;

In 2007, Palmer married the former Susan Earle, who has an adult son with autism. The Palmers have homes in Palm Beach, Florida, and Corona Del Mar, California. In 2006, Palmer also acquired a penthouse condominium in Little Italy, Baltimore, which he uses while in Baltimore for Orioles&#x27; broadcasts.

<doc id="674848" wikidata="Q368720" url="?curid=674848" title="William H. Webster">
<text>William Hedgcock Webster (born March 6, 1924) is an American retired attorney and jurist who most recently served as chair of the Homeland Security Advisory Council from 2005 until 2020. He was a United States district judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri and a United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit before becoming director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) from 1978 to 1987 and director of Central Intelligence (CIA) from 1987 to 1991. He is the only person to have held both positions.

==Education and career==
===Early life===
Webster was born in St. Louis, Missouri, and received his early education in Webster Groves, Missouri; and served as a lieutenant in the United States Navy during World War II. Following his service in the Navy, he received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Amherst College in Amherst, Massachusetts, in 1947. While at Amherst, he was a member of the Psi Upsilon fraternity. He received his Juris Doctor from the Washington University in St. Louis in 1949. After law school, he served in the Navy again during the Korean War; later, he joined the St. Louis law firm Armstrong Teasdale, but left private practice soon after to begin a career in public service. He was the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri from 1960 to 1961, then a member of the Missouri Board of Law Examiners from 1964 to 1969.

===Federal judicial service===
Webster was nominated by President Richard Nixon on December 8, 1970, to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, to a new seat created by 84 Stat. 294. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on December 17, 1970, and received his commission on December 21, 1970. His service was terminated on August 10, 1973, due to elevation to the Eighth Circuit.

Webster was nominated by President Nixon on June 13, 1973, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit vacated by Judge Marion Charles Matthes. He was confirmed by the Senate on July 13, 1973, and received his commission on July 18, 1973. His service was terminated on February 22, 1978, due to his resignation.

===Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (1978–1987)===
In 1978, President Jimmy Carter appointed him as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This was despite Webster being a registered Republican.

Webster was portrayed by actor Sean Cullen in Season 2 of the Netflix show &quot;Mindhunter&quot;, which took place during his tenure as director of the FBI.

===Director of Central Intelligence (1987–1991)===
In 1987, President Ronald Reagan chose him to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency. He led the CIA until his retirement from public office in 1991. Since then, Webster has practiced law at the Washington, D.C., office of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy, where he specializes in arbitration, mediation and internal investigation.
===Public Company Accounting Oversight Board===
In 2002, he was the first chairman of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). However, his appointment was controversial, and another controversy erupted when newspapers reported that Webster had headed the board audit committee of U.S. Technologies, a high-tech company being investigated for accounting irregularities and accused of fraud. Webster resigned less than three weeks after the PCAOB was set up.

Webster was the longtime chairman of the Homeland Security Advisory Council, from 2005 to 2020.

In 2020, Webster, along with over 130 other former Republican national security officials, signed a statement that asserted that President Trump was unfit to serve another term, and &quot;To that end, we are firmly convinced that it is in the best interest of our nation that Vice President Joe Biden be elected as the next President of the United States, and we will vote for him.&quot;

==Honors and awards==
Webster received numerous honors and awards for his service. Washington University granted him the Alumni Citation for contributions to the field of law in 1972 and in 1981 he received the William Greenleaf Eliot Award. In 1984, he received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards. In 1999 the School of Law created the Webster Society, an outstanding scholars program. Furthermore, he received the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the university&#x27;s law school in 1977. The &quot;St. Louis Globe-Democrat&quot; named him &quot;Man of the Year&quot;. In 1978, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

Webster also received honorary degrees from several colleges and universities. In 1991, he was presented the Distinguished Intelligence Medal, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the National Security Medal. In June 2008 Webster received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree as well as honorary doctorates from The Institute of World Politics and National Intelligence University. He received the William J. Donovan Award from The OSS Society in 2005 and serves as an honorary chairman of this organization.

Webster is a member of the American Bar Association, the Council of the American Law Institute, the Order of the Coif, The Missouri Bar, the Bar Association of Metropolitan St. Louis and the Psi Upsilon fraternity. Additionally, he served as chairman of the Corporation, Banking and Business Law Section of the American Bar Association. He is a fellow of the American Bar Foundation and an Honorary Fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers. He served as co-chairman of the Homeland Security Advisory Council. In 2009, he was named to head an independent investigation of the FBI&#x27;s actions surrounding the Fort Hood shooting.

Webster also serves as an honorary director on the board of directors at the Atlantic Council.

==Personal life==
Webster was married for 34 years to Drusilla Lane until her death in 1984 and the couple had three children: Drusilla L. Busch, William H. Webster Jr. and Katherine H. Roessle.

In 1990, Webster married Lynda Clugston. They reside in Washington, D.C.

In 2015, the couple were targeted by a man who peddled a lottery scam over phone calls and emails. Over multiple phone calls, Keniel Aeon Thomas of Jamaica told Webster and Clugston that he would set their house ablaze or have a sniper shoot them in the back of the head if they did not pay him thousands of dollars, according to prosecutors&#x27; filings. The couple used their friendship with people at the FBI to help send the scammer to prison for nearly six years in early 2019.

Webster turned 100 on March 6, 2024.

== Quotes ==
On March 3, 2002, the University of California, Santa Barbara, held a debate titled &quot;National Security vs. Personal Liberty&quot;. The guest speakers were Webster and American Civil Liberties Union President Nadine Strossen. During the debate, Webster made the following statement, which has since gained some popularity: &quot;Security is always seen as too much until the day it is not enough.&quot; He also stated: &quot;Order protects liberty and liberty protects order.&quot;

<doc id="674855" wikidata="Q850609" url="?curid=674855" title="Palmball">
<text>In baseball, the palmball pitch is a type of changeup. It requires placing the baseball tightly in the palm or held between the thumb and ring finger and then throwing it as if throwing a fastball. This takes some of the velocity off the pitch, intending to make the batter swing before the ball reaches the plate.

Notable pitchers who have been known to throw the palmball include Ray Sadecki, Steve Farr, Robinson Tejeda, Ed Whitson Edwar Ramírez, Dave Giusti, Bob Stanley, Orlando Hernández, Mark Williamson, John Holdzkom, Randy Martz, reliever Tony Fiore, Bryn Smith, and 1990s reliever Joe Boever. Former Philadelphia Phillies and Toronto Blue Jays ace Roy Halladay was known to have thrown a palmball early in his career, though he rarely used it later on.

Second on the All-Time saves list, Trevor Hoffman, made his palmball changeup his &quot;out&quot; pitch.

One of the more recent pitchers to utilize a palmball consistently in their repertoire is Taiwanese pitcher Chih-Wei Hu, who pitched for Tampa Bay Rays from 2017 to 2018. 

In earlier decades, the palmball was thrown by Ewell Blackwell, NL MVP winner Jim Konstanty, Cy Young Award winner Jim Palmer, and Satchel Paige. In 1968, Red Sox starter Ray Culp turned his career around by developing a palmball. Culp went 16-6 in 1968 and topped the Red Sox in wins from 1968-1970.

==Slip pitch==
The slip pitch was a similar pitch taught by Paul Richards to many young pitchers throughout Richards&#x27; career. As it is very similar to the palmball, slip pitch and palmball are often used interchangeably.

<doc id="674860" wikidata="Q550515" url="?curid=674860" title="Anthony Panizzi">
<text>Sir Antonio Genesio Maria Panizzi (16 September 1797 – 8 April 1879), better known as Anthony Panizzi, was a naturalised British citizen of Italian birth, and an Italian patriot. He was a librarian, becoming the Principal Librarian (i.e. head) of the British Museum from 1856 to 1866.

==Early life in Italy==
Panizzi was born at Brescello in the Duchy of Modena and Reggio (now the province of Reggio Emilia), Italy, on 16 September 1797. He studied at the Lyceum of Reggio, then obtained a degree in law from the University of Parma in 1818. He was appointed as Inspector of Public Schools at Brescello. It was during this time that a charge was brought against Panizzi that he was a Carbonaro, that is, a member of a secret society that opposed the political regime of that time. The evidence would suggest that the accusation was true.

In October 1822, amid political upheaval in Italy, Panizzi was tipped off that he faced arrest and trial as a subversive. The risk was one faced by many Carbonari while Metternich was orchestrating, from Vienna, the repressive policies of puppet regimes in north-eastern and central Italy. Making his way across Italy, Panizzi eventually arrived in Ticino (Switzerland). Here, in 1823, he wrote and published a book decrying the repressive regime and trials against citizens of the Duchy of Modena, &quot;Dei Processi e delle Sentenze contra gli imputati di Lesa Maestà e di aderenza alle Sette proscritte negli Stati di Modena&quot;. Following the book&#x27;s publication, he was indicted, tried, and condemned to death &quot;in absentia&quot; in Modena, and pressure was brought to have him expelled from Switzerland.

==Escape to England and subsequent career as a librarian==
In May 1823, Panizzi moved to England, becoming a British subject in 1832. Upon his arrival in London, Italian poet in exile Ugo Foscolo gave him a letter of introduction to Liverpool banker William Roscoe and he moved to that city, where he made a meagre living teaching Italian. In 1826 Panizzi met lawyer and political figure Henry Brougham and helped him in a difficult abduction case; when Brougham became Lord Chancellor of England, he obtained for Panizzi the Professorship of Italian at the newly founded London University (now University College London). He then held the post of &quot;Extra-Assistant-Keeper&quot; at the British Museum Library. Panizzi held a string of posts there: first Assistant Librarian (1831–1837), then Keeper of Printed Books (1837–1856) and finally Principal Librarian (1856–1866). For his extraordinary services as a librarian, in 1869 he was knighted by Queen Victoria, becoming a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath.

The British Museum library was the national library of the United Kingdom in all but name. During Panizzi&#x27;s tenure as Keeper of Printed Books its holdings increased from 235,000 to 540,000 volumes, making it the largest library in the world at the time. Its famous circular Reading Room was designed and built by architect Sydney Smirke from a sketch drawn by Panizzi. The new reading room opened in 1857. The British Museum library formed the bulk of what became the British Library in 1973 and the &quot;Round&quot; Reading Room was in use until 1997 when the Library moved to its current site at St. Pancras.

During his tenure at the Library, Panizzi was embroiled in many controversies. His appointment as Keeper of Printed Books was met with criticism due to Panizzi&#x27;s Italian origin: some felt an Englishman should be in charge of the national institution. Other sources state it was because he had been &quot;seen in the streets of London selling white mice.&quot;

Panizzi also had a long-term dispute with historian Thomas Carlyle. While Carlyle worked on his history of the French Revolution, he had complained in a magazine article that &quot;a certain sub-librarian&quot; had not been very helpful to him, restricting access to uncatalogued documents held by the British Museum. Panizzi never forgot the slight and when Carlyle, now working on the biography of Cromwell, requested the use of a private room at the library for his researches, the request was denied. Despite high-level complaints, Carlyle lost the argument; and he and his supporters opened their own independent subscription library, the London Library.

In 1835-1836 Panizzi recognized that the new Select Committee
of the House of Commons on the British Museum would be seeking accountability as to procedures. To prepare with comparative data he visited the main libraries of Western Europe, Italy and the Austrian Empire.

While at the library, Panizzi undertook the creation of a new catalogue, based on the &quot;Ninety-One Cataloguing Rules&quot; (1841) which he devised with his assistants. These rules served as the basis for all subsequent catalogue rules of the 19th and 20th centuries. They are at the origins of the ISBD and of digital cataloguing elements such as Dublin Core. Panizzi had to give up his concept of &quot;corporate main entry&quot; to have his 91 Rules code approved. Panizzi&#x27;s idea of corporate authorship later came to public attention through Charles C. Jewett&#x27;s code for the catalog of the Smithsonian Institution in 1850.

Panizzi was also influential in enforcing the Copyright Act of 1842, which required British publishers to deposit with the library a copy of every book printed in Britain.

Panizzi was a strong advocate of free and equal access to learning, evident in the quote below:
I want a poor student to have the same means of indulging his learned curiosity, of following his rational pursuits, of consulting the same authorities, of fathoming the most intricate inquiry as the richest man in the kingdom, as far as books go, and I contend that the Government is bound to give him the most liberal and unlimited assistance in this respect.
Panizzi is credited with the invention of the &quot;Panizzi pin&quot;, a shelf-support pin which prevents wooden shelves from &quot;wobbling&quot;.

==Political activities and honours==

Panizzi was a personal friend of British Prime ministers Lord Palmerston and William Ewart Gladstone, conducted an active correspondence with Sardinian, and later Italian Prime Minister Count Camillo Benso di Cavour, and through French archaeologist and writer Prosper Mérimée, was well acquainted with French Emperor Napoleon III and Empress Eugénie. In 1844, Panizzi also assisted Giuseppe Mazzini, then in exile in London, by publishing an influential article denouncing the practice ordered by the Home Secretary of ordering Mazzini&#x27;s private letters opened by the Post Office and giving copies of their contents to the Austrian Embassy. He also orchestrated a visit of Giuseppe Garibaldi to England, and convinced Gladstone to travel to Naples to view personally the inhumane conditions in which political prisoners were kept. When his efforts to have these prisoners released failed, he raised money to buy a ship and mounted an expedition to rescue the prisoners from the island fortress of Santo Stefano in the Gulf of Gaeta. Unfortunately, the ship sank in a storm shortly after leaving England. In 1859, the prisoners were released by Neapolitan King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies and put on a ship bound for New York. Panizzi helped to ensure that the ship made port in England instead, where the former prisoners received asylum and were assured support.

In addition to his English knighthood, Panizzi was given an honorary degree by Oxford University, the Légion d&#x27;Honneur from France, various chivalric honours from the Italian Government and Crown, and in 1868 was appointed as a senator in the Italian Parliament. He never took his seat there.

Panizzi died in London on 8 April 1879 and was buried in the Kensal Green Catholic Cemetery, not far from the resting places of William Makepeace Thackeray and Anthony Trollope.
Panizzi also prepared and published editions of Matteo Maria Boiardo&#x27;s &quot;Orlando Innamorato&quot; and Ludovico Ariosto&#x27;s &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;.

The Panizzi Lectures are an annual series of bibliography lectures, hosted by the British Library since 1985. There is also a staff meeting room at the British Library called the Panizzi Room in his honour.

<doc id="674863" wikidata="Q4790673" url="?curid=674863" title="Arima Onsen">
<text>is an onsen, or hot springs in Kita-ku, Kobe, Japan. This Onsen is still a hidden treasure of modern Kobe, behind Mount Rokkō. It attracts many Japanese who want tranquility with beautiful natural surroundings and yet easy access from the busy cities in the Kansai metropolitan area including Osaka. Arima Onsen was named in the Heian-period &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; as one of the three famous springs in Japan. It was selected as the most prestigious hot spring during the Edo period.

==History==

This onsen is one of Japan&#x27;s oldest, with Dōgo Onsen in Ehime Prefecture and Nanki-Shirahama Onsen in Wakayama Prefecture. Many documents since the 8th century AD mention this onsen.

According to these documents, among the many visitors to Arima Onsen are Gyoki (行基), a charismatic Buddhist monk in the 7th century, and Ninsai (仁西), another monk in the 12th century. Ninsai was said to greatly admire Arima Onsen and helped develop it. Hideyoshi Toyotomi visited this onsen several times in the 16th century.

==Springs==

Arima Onsen has two kinds of springs. One is , which has water colored yellow-brown from iron and salt. The other is , which is colorless and contains radium and carbonate.

==Accommodation==

In 2007, there were more than 20 hotels and inns in the Arima Onsen area, with Arima Grand Hotel being one of the largest in the area.

<text>Zinkenite is a steel-gray metallic sulfosalt mineral composed of lead antimony sulfide Pb9Sb22S42. Zinkenite occurs as acicular needle-like crystals.

It was first described in 1826 for an occurrence in the Harz Mountains, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany and named after its discoverer, German mineralogist and mining geologist, Johann Karl Ludwig Zinken (1790–1862).

<text>Heber Doust Curtis (June 27, 1872 – January 9, 1942) was an American astronomer. He participated in 11 expeditions for the study of solar eclipses, and, as an advocate and theorist that additional galaxies existed outside of the Milky Way, was involved in the 1920 Shapley–Curtis Debate concerning the size and galactic structure of the universe.

== Biography ==

Curtis was born on June 27, 1872, the elder son of Orson Blair Curtis and Sarah Eliza Doust.

He studied at the University of Michigan and at the University of Virginia, earning a degree in astronomy from the latter.

From 1902 to 1920 Curtis worked at Lick Observatory, continuing the survey of nebulae initiated by Keeler. He headed up the Lick southern station in Chile from 1905 until 1909, when he returned to take charge of the Crossley telescope. In 1912 he was elected president of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific.

In 1918 he observed Messier 87 and was the first to notice the astrophysical jet which he described as a &quot;curious straight ray ... apparently connected with the nucleus by a thin line of matter.&quot;

In 1920 he was appointed director of the Allegheny Observatory. In the same year he participated in the Great Debate with Harlow Shapley (also called the Shapley–Curtis Debate) on the nature of nebulae and galaxies, and the size of the universe. Curtis advocated the now-accepted view that other galaxies apart from the Milky Way existed.

Curtis also invented a type of film plate comparator in about 1925, allowing 2 plates, each 8×10 in, to be compared using a set of prisms and placing the plates on stacked and aligned stages rather than next to one another as was the norm, this allowed the body of the device to measure just 60×51 cm. 
This device is packed in crates and resided at UCO Lick Observatory as of Aug 2011.
His article describing the device appears in the &quot;Publications of the Allegheny Observatory&quot;, vol. VIII, no. 2.

In 1930 Curtis was appointed director of the University of Michigan observatories, but the shortage of funds following the Great Depression prevented the construction of a large reflector he had designed for the university at Ann Arbor. He contributed to develop the McMath–Hulbert private observatory at Lake Angelus.

Curtis was an opponent of Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity.

He died on January 9, 1942.

== Legacy ==
The Heber Doust Curtis Memorial Telescope at the Portage Lake Observatory was dedicated in 1950 in Curtis&#x27; memory. It no longer operates, but remains as a memorial to Curtis. A small lunar crater east of the larger crater Picard in Mare Crisium received the official name Curtis.

<text>Michael David Skupin (; born January 29, 1962) is a convicted fraudster and child sex offender. Best known for competing on two seasons of the reality competition show &quot;Survivor&quot;, he became the first person to be medically evacuated from the game after falling into a fire on &quot;&quot;.

==Early life==
Skupin was born January 29, 1962, in Farmington Hills, Michigan. When he was four, his father died of cancer. His mother, Mary Louise Skupin, went on to marry Clarence Landry when Michael was ten. Michael then took his stepfather&#x27;s last name, though Clarence had never officially adopted him.

While in high school, Michael Landry became an athlete, playing tight end for the football team at Brother Rice High School in Birmingham. During his junior year, Landry was expelled for throwing water balloons at some students at a neighboring all-girls high school. For his senior year, he transferred to St. Mary&#x27;s Preparatory in Orchard Lake where, even before his expulsion, he was offered a spot on their football team playing both tight end and linebacker.

After high school, Landry tried to enroll at Western Michigan University (WMU), but he was initially denied acceptance due to the fact that no Social Security number existed for a &quot;Michael Landry.&quot; He reapplied to WMU under his birth name, Michael Skupin, and was later accepted. In 1984, Skupin graduated with a B.B.A. degree.

==Career==
Skupin&#x27;s first job after college was selling copiers for 3M. In 1992, he teamed up with a childhood friend, Greg Swan, to found Rhinosoft Interactive, a software company based out of Wisconsin. In 2000, Rhinosoft was involved in a controversy when some CD-ROM versions of the Bible, published by Skupin and Swan, were distributed into various boxes of cereal as part of a promotion by General Mills. The cereal company, which had been distributing computer games and dictionaries on CD-ROM as part of the same promotion, claimed that it was unaware of the presence of the Bible CD-ROMs. General Mills apologized for the move, stating that it was against company policy to &quot;advance any particular set of religious beliefs,&quot; although Swan insisted that the company had indeed been aware of the disc-based Bibles all along.

Skupin, a Christian, is also the founder of Michael Skupin Ministries, which helps people combat addiction. He had also considered running for the United States Senate in 2002, but ultimately decided against it. In addition, he has written a book about his life, entitled &quot;Fireproof&quot;. The book was released in 2004.

In 2000, Skupin flew to Australia to film the of the TV series &quot;Survivor&quot;. He was one of 16 castaways competing for the $1 million prize and the title of Sole Survivor. Upon the start of the game, Skupin was placed on the Kucha tribe, and was almost immediately seen as the tribe&#x27;s leader. At first, he disavowed the role of tribal leader, but later embraced being the tribe&#x27;s main provider, catching fish for the tribe and even killing a wild pig for its meat.

On Day 17, Skupin was tending to a fire at camp, when he accidentally inhaled some of the fumes and passed out into the fire. Seconds later, he let out a scream, then ran frantically into the water as his hands were now burned severely. The medical team was called in, and they determined that his injuries were too severe to keep him in the game. He was then evacuated by helicopter to seek further medical treatment, making him the first &quot;Survivor&quot; player ever to be medically evacuated and the first to be eliminated from the game without being voted off first. Overall, he was the sixth contestant to exit the game, and finished in 11th place.

===&quot;Philippines&quot;===
In 2012, Skupin returned to &quot;Survivor&quot; for its . He was one of three previous medical evacuees returning to the game, along with Jonathan Penner (evacuated from &quot;&quot;) and &quot;&quot; evacuee Russell Swan (no relation to Greg Swan, Skupin&#x27;s friend and business partner). At the start, Skupin was assigned to the Tandang tribe. One of his tribemates was Lisa Whelchel, whom he recognized as one of the stars of the hit TV series &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;.

Initially, his alliance included fellow tribemates R.C. Saint-Amour, Pete Yurkowski, and Abi-Maria Gomes. No one in this alliance was eliminated prior to the merge, as Tandang did not lose one single tribal immunity challenge. After the merge, on Day 22, Skupin teamed up with Whelchel, and five days later, the two of them agreed to form a new alliance with Denise Stapley and Malcolm Freberg. At the Final Five Tribal Council, the four of them were planning on voting out Gomes, who repeatedly called Skupin a &quot;moron&quot; in an attempt to convince him and the others to take her to the end as a sacrificial lamb, as Gomes was perceived as having no shot at getting any jury votes. Gomes was sent to the jury anyway, and at the Final Four immunity challenge, Skupin won immunity, and went on to join Whelchel and Stapley in voting out Freberg.

At the Final Tribal Council, Skupin was berated by the jury for his perceived strategic and social ineptitude. In particular, he was asked by Jeff Kent whether he was the type of person who makes things happen, watches things happen, or wonders what happened. In addition, Carter Williams asked Skupin to tell the jury why he had decided to vote Williams out. In the end, Skupin received only one jury vote, from Williams. Whelchel also received one vote, while Stapley won the title of Sole Survivor with six votes.

==Criminal background==
On February 23, 2013, Skupin was arrested for driving on a suspended license, having an improper license plate, and lacking proof of insurance. His driver&#x27;s license was revealed to have been suspended approximately 20 times dating back to 1999.

In December 2013, Rob Wolchek, an investigative reporter for WJBK in Detroit, inducted Skupin into his &quot;Hall of Shame&quot; for an alleged Ponzi scheme involving Skupin&#x27;s financial business, called Pay It Forward. Wolchek alleged that Skupin never paid his investors any of the promised dividends.

On February 5, 2016, Skupin was arrested for his alleged role with Pay It Forward, being charged with five counts of larceny by conversion and one count of racketeering. Unrelated to these accusations, he was also charged with six counts of possession of child pornography, as such images, allegedly belonging to him, were discovered on his laptop while police were searching it during the Ponzi scheme investigation. Skupin&#x27;s bond was set at US$350,000. On November 18, he was found guilty of four out of the six child pornography counts. A separate trial for his involvement with Pay It Forward took place November 21, during which he pleaded no contest to a single count of larceny by conversion, as part of a plea deal. He was sentenced to serve one to four years in prison for possession of child pornography, and four years&#x27; probation plus $31,800 in restitution for larceny. He was released on parole, on December 19, 2017, after serving a year in prison. His parole formally ended on January 3, 2021.

<doc id="674875" wikidata="Q8068040" url="?curid=674875" title="Onimusha">
<text>is a series of action-adventure video games developed and published by Capcom. It makes use of the historic figures that shaped Japan&#x27;s history, retelling their stories with supernatural elements. Most of the games are of the action-adventure genre, a combination of third-person hack-and-slash combat and puzzle elements. The player protagonist wields the power of the &quot;Oni&quot;, enabling them to fight the &quot;Genma&quot;, the main enemy in the series. As of June 2024, the series has sold a total of 8.7 million copies worldwide, making it Capcom&#x27;s tenth best-selling franchise, behind &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, &quot;Monster Hunter&quot;, &quot;Street Fighter&quot;, &quot;Mega Man&quot;, &quot;Devil May Cry&quot;, &quot;Dead Rising&quot;, &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Dogma&quot;, &quot;Ace Attorney&quot;, and &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot;.

A high-definition remaster of the first game, &quot;&quot;, was released in December 2018 for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. A Windows version was released in January 2019.

==Games==
The series originated in 1997, with Yoshiki Okamoto&#x27;s idea to create &quot;Sengoku Biohazard&quot;, a ninja version of Capcom&#x27;s own 1996 &quot;Resident Evil&quot; (known as &quot;Biohazard&quot; in Japan), set in the Sengoku period and featuring a &quot;ninja house&quot; filled with booby traps, similar to the mansion from &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, where battles are fought using swords and shuriken. The project was originally intended for the Nintendo 64&#x27;s 64DD.

&quot;Onimusha: Warlords&quot; began development for the original PlayStation, but the project was eventually moved to the PlayStation 2. The half-finished PS1 version of &quot;Onimusha&quot; was scrapped and never released.

The central character of the series, Samanosuke Akechi, is modeled after Takeshi Kaneshiro, who also voiced the character. People were used as models for other characters in the series, including Yūsaku Matsuda in &quot;Onimusha 2: Samurai&#x27;s Destiny&quot; and Jean Reno in &quot;Onimusha 3: Demon Siege&quot;. Character movements throughout the series were created using motion capture.

The series was initially planned to be only a trilogy, but a fourth installment, &quot;&quot; was released in 2006. Keiji Inafune said that &quot;Onimusha 3: Demon Siege&quot; is the end of the Nobunaga storyline, and &quot;Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams&quot; is a new storyline. 

&quot;Shin Onimusha: Curtain Of Darkness&quot;, a mobile phone game, was released in Japan in 2005. &quot;Onimusha Soul&quot;, a browser-based game, was released on June 28, 2012. The game was also released for mobile phones in July 2013 and for PlayStation 3&#x27;s PlayStation Network on February 25, 2014. The mobile version was shut down on May 13, 2015.

&quot;Onimusha VR: Shadow Team&quot;, the first VR entry in the &quot;Onimusha&quot; series, was shown at Amusement Expo 2024.

&quot;Onimusha: Way of the Sword&quot; was announced at The Game Awards 2024 event in December, with an estimated release in 2026.

==Gameplay==

Although the protagonist changes in every &quot;Onimusha&quot; title, he is always a skilled swordsman who embarks on a set mission which involves slaying demons and fearsome enemies during the waning years of the Sengoku period of feudal Japan. In each game, the protagonist has the ability to absorb Genma souls from defeated enemies, which help to restore health, infuse power in weapons and armor, and provide power for the elemental attacks of special weapons.

The player controls their character using the D-pad (although later games such as &quot;Onimusha 3: Demon Siege&quot; and &quot;&quot; introduced analog stick control) and travels in a fairly linear method, able to rotate slowly with the input of an opposing direction. Characters tend to move slowly and can only slightly increase their speed with the dash maneuver by tapping twice in any direction. Actions common to many action-oriented games, such as jumping, grabbing, and climbing over obstacles, cannot be performed in &quot;Onimusha&quot; games.

&quot;Onimusha&quot; is action-oriented with an emphasis on combat, and employing some horror elements. The player has an arsenal of weaponry, ranging from katana to elemental-based broadswords. The player possesses a limited supply of spiritual energy which can be used for magical attacks. These magical attacks, which vary depending upon which weapon is equipped and other offensive attributes, can be improved throughout the game by accumulation of souls from defeated enemies.

==Plot==
Based primarily throughout the Japanese Sengoku period, &quot;&quot; starts with the feudal lord Nobunaga Oda being killed during a battle. One of the prominent fighters, Hidemitsu Samanosuke Akechi, receives a letter from his cousin Princess Yuki who is concerned about servants from her castle disappearing. Samanosuke joins with the kunoichi Kaede to rescue Yuki and discover demonic creatures known as Genma. In order to defeat the Genma, the Oni clan grant Samanosuke powers from their kind. Across his fights Samanosuke discovers the Genma have resurrected Nobunaga into serving their needs while intending to sacrifice Yuki and an orphan named Yumemaru to grant him more powers. Samanosuke manages to save Yuki and Yumemaru and kills the Genma Lord, the God of Light Fortinbras. Samanosuke&#x27;s group then takes different paths.

The sequel, &quot;Onimusha 2: Samurai&#x27;s Destiny&quot;, has Nobunaga using the Genma in his forces to unify Japan, wiping out Yagyu village whose clan are Genma exterminators. The clan&#x27;s only survivor, Jubei Yagyu, goes on a quest to avenge his clan while learning he inherited Oni powers from his mother as he uses them alongside the Oni&#x27;s five orbs to battle Nobunaga&#x27;s soldiers. Across his journey, Jubei meets several allies who also seek Nobunaga&#x27;s life. Jubei manages to infiltrate Gifu castle and confronts Nobunaga alone. Although Jubei kills Nobunaga, the warlord&#x27;s soul escapes and later reconstitutes himself. The spin-off &quot;&quot; has the cast from &quot;Warlords&quot; and &quot;Samurai&#x27;s Destiny&quot; in a new battle against Nobunaga&#x27;s forces.

The third game, &quot;Onimusha 3: Demon Siege&quot;, has Samanosuke&#x27;s clan attacking the Oda forces again. Before confronting Nobunaga, Samanosuke is transported to Modern Paris as a result of an experiment made by the Genma scientist Guildernstern to enable his kin to conquer more lands. In the meantime, service agent Jacques Blanc is a victim of Guildernstern while transported to Japan&#x27;s Sengoku period. There, Jacques is granted Oni powers by an Oni who tells him to join forces with this timeline&#x27;s Samanosuke and defeat Nobunaga if he wishes to return home. While Jacques aids Samanosuke in the past, in the future Samanosuke is helped by Jacques&#x27; family to investigate the Genma. In the end, the two Oni warriors are successful in stopping the invasion and returning to their respective times. Samanosuke manages to slay Nobunaga and seal his soul within the Oni Gauntlet to avoid another resurrection.

The fourth game, &quot;&quot;, had Nobunaga&#x27;s servant Hideyoshi Toyotomi unified Japan with the Genma whom he supported in their actions. His illegitimate son, Hideyasu &quot;Soki&quot; Yuki, goes on a quest to defeat Hideyoshi and stop the Genma. He is aided by several other warriors, including an elder Samanosuke who recognizes him as the Black Oni, the God of Darkness. After mastering his Oni powers, Soki joins with his friends to defeat Hideyoshi&#x27;s army. In the aftermath, it is revealed that Hideyoshi was a mere puppet of the Genma Triumvirate who wish to resurrect Fortinbras at his full power as the Genmas&#x27; God of Light. Although the Genma Triumvirate and Hideyoshi are defeated, Fortinbras resurrects with Soki using the Oni Gauntlet to destroy the Genma and restore the country&#x27;s peace at the cost of his life. Soon after, Samanosuke embarks on a quest to seal away the Oni Gauntlet to prevent Nobunaga from being released.

==Main characters==

Samanosuke Akechi (明智 左馬之介 秀満 Akechi Samanosuke Hidemitsu), later also known under the moniker Tenkai Nankōbō during his appearance in &quot;&quot;, is the main protagonist of the first and third installments in the &quot;Onimusha&quot; series: &quot;&quot; and &quot;Onimusha 3: Demon Siege&quot;. He also appears as a supporting playable character in the fourth game &quot;&quot;, and as one of the combatants in &quot;&quot;. He is loosely based on the historical figure, Akechi Hidemitsu. His in-game model is based and voiced by Takeshi Kaneshiro. Samanosuke is the only character to appear in all four mainline &quot;Onimusha&quot; games. He appears in &quot;Onimusha 2&quot; in a flashback drawing.

Jūbei Yagyū is the main protagonist of &quot;Onimusha 2: Samurai&#x27;s Destiny&quot;. As the first leader of the Yagyū clan seen in the series and originator of Shin-in style sword combat, he was born as Sougen but later given the name Jūbei as a child, a tradition which would continue as seen with his granddaughter. His father was the late Head of the Yagyū clan, who was seduced and had a child by a woman who disappeared shortly thereafter. Jūbei never knew his mother, but does meet his mother during the events of &quot;Samurai&#x27;s Destiny&quot;. His in-game character is modeled after late Japanese actor Matsuda Yusaku.

Hideyasu &quot;Sōki&quot; Yūki is the main protagonist in &quot;Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams&quot;. He is the biological son of Ieyasu Tokugawa and a warrior who possesses the dark power of the Oni. He goes by many names besides Sōki and Hideyasu Yuki: Blue Demon and Oni of the Ash. Having Lamentation, his prized broadsword he learned about Hideyoshi&#x27;s insidious scheme, he sets out on a journey to burn the Genma trees and defeat the Genma running rampant across the land. He is the first &quot;Onimusha&quot; main character to not be modeled after an actor. He is also the only main character to be killed, dying at the end of &quot;Dawn of Dreams&quot; after sacrificing himself to destroy the Oni Star. Soki has appeared as a playable character in &quot;Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars&quot;.

Jacques Blanc is one of two main protagonists (the other being Samanosuke Akechi) in &quot;Onimusha 3: Demon Siege&quot;. Working as a policeman, he is the first Westerner who wields the Oni Power, originating from France. He is modeled after French actor Jean Reno.

Nobunaga Oda (織田信長) is the main antagonist in the first three &quot;Onimusha&quot; games, in particular &quot;Onimusha 2: Samurai&#x27;s Destiny&quot; and &quot;Onimusha 3: Demon Siege&quot;, where he is the final boss in those two games. In real world history, Nobunaga is viewed culturally as both a hero and as a villain for respectively trying to unite his nation during the Sengoku Period and the horrific lengths he took to achieve his goal. In this timeline he forms an alliance with the demons for power and to conquer Japan. Despite being killed at the beginning of &quot;Onimusha: Warlords&quot;, he returns as a demon. He battles Jubei at the end of &quot;Samurai&#x27;s Destiny&quot; but due to Jubei not having an Oni Gauntlet to seal his soul, his death was only temporary. He returns in &quot;Demon Siege&quot; after being revived by the demons again. He is finally killed by Samanosuke and sealed in his Oni Gauntlet.

Fortinbras (フォーティンブラス), also referred to as the &quot;God of Light&quot;, is the king and most powerful of all Genma. He appears as the final boss in &quot;Onimusha: Warlords&quot; and &quot;Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams&quot;. In &quot;Dawn of Dreams&quot; he is revealed to have two forms, a human form and a serpent form. He is finally killed by Soki after Soki sacrifices himself to stop the Oni Star.

Hideyoshi Toyotomi (豊臣 秀吉) is an antagonist who has appeared in every main game of the &quot;Onimusha&quot; series. Historically, Hideyoshi is the most famous peasant-samurai in Japan as he rose from being a vassal of Nobunaga Oda to the man who united Japan with his short-lived reign as regent. He is the main antagonist of &quot;Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams&quot;.

==Reception==
The &quot;Onimusha&quot; series has received overall positive reviews with most of the main games on the PlayStation 2, receiving average scores of more than 80%. As a comparison, most spin-offs from the series have not been as successful. The titles have influenced other games from the company including &quot;Devil May Cry&quot;, &quot;Shadow of Rome&quot; and &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot;. The samurai game &quot;&quot; was cited by Inafune as an &quot;&quot;Onimusha&quot; clone&quot; although its designer Yoshiki Okamoto denied such statement.

The series has often been compared with the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; series and has been praised for its focus in action. The first two games, however, were criticized for forcing the player to use the Directional Pad rather than the left analogue to make the playable character to move. This issue was solved with the third release which generated a good response. Another subject of criticism is the length of each game with opinions sometimes differing due to the replay value they offer. Yoshinori Ono acknowledged the third game&#x27;s short length and thus made &quot;Dawn of Dreams&quot; become the series&#x27; longest title.

The original game was a major hit on the PS2, becoming the console&#x27;s first game to sell over a million copies. While &quot;Onimusha 2&quot; was also a best-selling title Capcom noticed how it did poorly in European regions. The third and fourth titles received less favorable sales with Keiji Inafune addressing people&#x27;s concerns about how the former game did not feel like a samurai story while various gaming journalists noted the latter was overshadowed by next generation consoles. As of June 2024 the series has sold 8.7 million copies to date.

==Adaptations==
===Canceled film===
In May 2003, Paramount Pictures, Davis Films and Gaga Productions announced its joint venture to adapt the &quot;Onimusha&quot; game series into a $50 million live-action feature film. According to Paramount and Davis Films&#x27; Samuel Hadida: &quot;It&#x27;s samurai fighting against demons – it&#x27;s very close to this simple pitch. There&#x27;s also a love story woven in. It&#x27;s a big adventure movie with lots of special effects&quot;. He also proposed the possibility of a film franchise.

In December 2006, director Christophe Gans said that he had &quot;Onimusha&quot; lined up to film. The film, budgeted at over $70 million, was to begin production in China in February 2008 for a December 2009 release. Takeshi Kaneshiro was rumored to be in the film, reprising his role as Samanosuke. Hadida had to delay the filming of &quot;Onimusha&quot;, which has resulted in the film&#x27;s Japanese cast working on other film projects during the delay, and being unavailable to start filming &quot;Onimusha&quot;. These factors meant that Gans would direct an adaptation of Leo Perutz&#x27;s novel &quot;The Swedish Cavalier&quot; first. Satomi Ishihara and Tsuyoshi Ihara remained attached to the project. There has been no further news regarding this film since 2007, and any plans for a live-action film were quietly canceled.

===Anime series===

An anime series adaptation was released in November 2023. It was produced by Sublimation and directed by Shin&#x27;ya Sugai, with Takashi Miike as chief director. The main character, Musashi Miyamoto, is modeled after Toshiro Mifune and voiced by Akio Otsuka, who previously portrayed Nobunaga Oda in the video games.

<text>Margaret Wise Brown (May 23, 1910 – November 13, 1952) was an American writer of children&#x27;s books, including &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; (1947) and &quot;The Runaway Bunny&quot; (1942), both illustrated by Clement Hurd. She has been called &quot;the laureate of the nursery&quot; for her achievements.

==Life and career==
Brown was born in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, the middle child of three children of Maude Margaret (Johnson) and Robert Bruce Brown. She was the granddaughter of politician Benjamin Gratz Brown. Her parents had an unhappy marriage. She was initially raised in Brooklyn&#x27;s Greenpoint neighborhood, and later attended Chateau Brilliantmont boarding school in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1923, while her parents were living in India and Canterbury, Connecticut.

In 1925, Brown attended The Kew-Forest School. She began attending Dana Hall School in Wellesley, Massachusetts, in 1926, where she did well in athletics. After graduation in 1928, Brown went on to Hollins College in Roanoke, Virginia.

Brown was an avid, lifelong beagler and was noted for her ability to keep pace, on foot, with the hounds.

Following her graduation with a B.A. in English from Hollins in 1932, Brown worked as a teacher and also studied art. While working at the Bank Street Experimental School in New York City she started writing books for children. Bank Street promoted a new approach to children&#x27;s education and literature, emphasizing the real world and the &quot;here and now&quot;. This philosophy influenced Brown&#x27;s work; she was also inspired by the poet Gertrude Stein, whose literary style influenced Brown&#x27;s own writing.

Brown&#x27;s first published children&#x27;s book was &quot;When the Wind Blew&quot;, published in 1937 by Harper &amp; Brothers. Impressed by Brown&#x27;s &quot;here and now&quot; style, W. R. Scott hired her as his first editor in 1938. Through Scott, she published the &quot;Noisy Book&quot; series among others. As editor at Scott, one of Brown&#x27;s first projects was to recruit contemporary authors to write children&#x27;s books for the company. Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck neglected to respond, but Brown&#x27;s hero, Gertrude Stein, accepted the offer. Stein&#x27;s book &quot;The World is Round&quot; was illustrated by Clement Hurd, who had previously teamed with Brown on W. R. Scott&#x27;s &quot;Bumble Bugs and Elephants&quot;, considered &quot;perhaps the first modern board book for babies&quot;. Brown and Hurd later teamed on the children&#x27;s book classics &quot;The Runaway Bunny&quot; and &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot;, published by Harper. In addition to publishing a number of Brown&#x27;s books, under her editorship, W. R. Scott published Edith Thacher Hurd&#x27;s first book, &quot;Hurry Hurry&quot;, and Esphyr Slobodkina&#x27;s classic &quot;Caps for Sale&quot;.

The New York Public Library initially banned &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; due to the influence of retired librarian Anne Carrol Moore, who reportedly &quot;hated&quot; the book. It wasn&#x27;t until 1972 that the book was finally made available to patrons.

From 1944 to 1946, Doubleday published three picture books written by Brown under the pseudonym &quot;Golden MacDonald&quot; (coopted from her friend&#x27;s handyman) and illustrated by Leonard Weisgard. Weisgard was a runner-up for the Caldecott Medal in 1946, and he won the 1947 Medal for &quot;Little Lost Lamb&quot; and &quot;The Little Island&quot;. Two more of their collaborations appeared in 1953 and 1956, after Brown&#x27;s death. &quot;The Little Fisherman&quot;, illustrated by Dahlov Ipcar, was published in 1945. &quot;The Little Fur Family&quot;, illustrated by Garth Williams, was published in 1946. Early in the 1950s, she wrote several books for the Little Golden Books series, including &quot;The Color Kittens&quot;, &quot;Mister Dog&quot;, and &quot;Scuppers The Sailor Dog&quot;.

== Personal life and death ==
While at Hollins, Brown was briefly engaged. She dated, for some time, an unknown &quot;good, quiet man from Virginia&quot;, had a long-running affair with William Gaston, and had a summer romance with Preston Schoyer.

In the summer of 1940, Brown began a long-term relationship with Blanche Oelrichs (pen name Michael Strange), poet/playwright, actress, and the former wife of John Barrymore. The relationship, which began as a mentoring one, eventually became romantic and included cohabiting at 10 Gracie Square in New York, beginning in 1943. As a studio, they used Cobble Court, a wooden house later moved to Charles Street. Oelrichs, who was almost 20 years Brown&#x27;s senior, died in 1950.

Brown went by various nicknames in different circles of friends. To her Dana Hall and Hollins friends she was &quot;Tim&quot;, as her hair was the color of timothy hay. To Bank Street friends, she was &quot;Brownie&quot;. To William Gaston she was &quot;Goldie&quot;, in keeping with the use of Golden MacDonald as the author of &quot;The Little Island&quot;.

In 1952, Brown met James Stillman &#x27;Pebble&#x27; Rockefeller Jr. at a party, and they became engaged. Later that year, while on a book tour in Nice, France, she died at 42 of an embolism, shortly after surgery for a ruptured appendix. Kicking up her leg to show her nurses how well she was feeling caused a blood clot that had formed in her leg to dislodge and travel to her heart.

A 2022 profile in the New Yorker, entitled &quot;The Radical Woman Behind &#x27;Goodnight Moon&#x27;&quot;, featured a trip through Brown&#x27;s &quot;Only House&quot; island cottage in Vinalhaven, Maine, which still retains elements of her picture books. The profile includes an interview with Rockefeller, noting that he was one of the few living people who&#x27;d known Brown well. They had planned to marry in Panama and honeymoon aboard his boat, the Mandalay, but she did not recover. Rockefeller told the interviewer:

In 2018, Rockefeller released a memoir called &quot;Wayfarer&quot;, about his own long life of adventure, including his memories of Brown.

By the time of her death, Brown had authored well over 100 books. Her ashes were scattered at her island home, &quot;The Only House&quot;, in Vinalhaven, Maine.

== Legacy ==
Brown bequeathed the royalties to many of her books including &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; and &quot;The Runaway Bunny&quot; to Albert Clarke, the son of a neighbor who was nine years old when she died. In 2000, reporter Joshua Prager detailed in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; the troubled life of Clarke, who squandered the millions of dollars the books had earned him and who believed that Brown was his mother, a claim others dismiss. Clarke passed away in 2018. His four children now hold the royalty rights, which will expire in 2043. 

Brown left behind over 70 unpublished manuscripts. After unsuccessfully trying to sell them, her sister Roberta Brown Rauch kept them in a cedar trunk for decades. In 1991, a future biographer, Amy Gary of WaterMark Inc., rediscovered the paper-clipped bundles, more than 500 typewritten pages in all, and set about getting the stories published.

Many of Brown&#x27;s books have been re-issued with new illustrations decades after their original publication. Many more of her books are still in print with the original illustrations. Her books have been translated into several languages. Full-length biographies on Brown have been written by Leonard S. Marcus (Harper Paperbacks, 1999) and by Amy Gary (Flatiron Books, 2017). There are also several biographies for children, including by Carol Greene (Rookie Biographies, 1994), Jill C. Wheeler (Checkerboard Books, 2006), Mac Barnett (HarperCollins, 2019), and Candice Ransom (William B Eerdmans, 2021). Claudia H. Pearson published a Freudian analysis of Brown&#x27;s &quot;classic series&quot; of bunny books, entitled &quot;Have a Carrot&quot; (Look Again Press, 2010).

In 2016, Hollins University honored her by establishing the Margaret Wise Brown Prize in Children’s Literature.

<text>Patrick Kavanagh (21 October 1904 – 30 November 1967) was an Irish poet and novelist. His best-known works include the novel &quot;Tarry Flynn&quot;, and the poems &quot;On Raglan Road&quot; and &quot;The Great Hunger&quot;. He is known for his accounts of Irish life through reference to the everyday and commonplace.

==Life and work==

===Early life===
Patrick Kavanagh was born in rural Inniskeen, County Monaghan, in 1904, the fourth of ten children of James Kavanagh and Bridget Quinn. His grandfather was a schoolteacher called &quot;Kevany&quot;, which a local priest changed to &quot;Kavanagh&quot; at his baptism. The grandfather had to leave the area following a scandal and never taught in a national school again, but married and raised a family in Tullamore. Patrick Kavanagh&#x27;s father, James, was a cobbler and farmer. Kavanagh&#x27;s brother Peter became a university professor and writer, two of their sisters were teachers, three became nurses, and one became a nun.

Patrick Kavanagh was a pupil at Kednaminsha National School from 1909 to 1916, leaving in sixth class at the age of 13. He became apprenticed to his father as a shoemaker and worked on his farm. He was also goalkeeper for the Inniskeen Gaelic football team. He later reflected: &quot;Although the literal idea of the peasant is of a farm labouring person, in fact a peasant is all that mass of mankind which lives below a certain level of consciousness. They live in the dark cave of the unconscious and they scream when they see the light.&quot; He also commented that, although he had grown up in a poor district, &quot;the real poverty was lack of enlightenment [and] I am afraid this fog of unknowing affected me dreadfully.&quot;

===Writing career===

Kavanagh&#x27;s first published work appeared in 1928 in the &quot;Dundalk Democrat&quot; and the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;. Kavanagh had encountered a copy of the &quot;Irish Statesman&quot;, edited by George William Russell, who published under the pen name AE and was a leader of the Irish Literary Revival. Russell at first rejected Kavanagh&#x27;s work but encouraged him to keep submitting, and he went on to publish verses by Kavanagh in 1929 and 1930. This inspired the farmer to leave home and attempt to further his aspirations. In 1931, he walked 80 miles (abt. 129 kilometres) to meet Russell in Dublin, where Kavanagh&#x27;s brother was a teacher. Russell gave Kavanagh books, among them works by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Victor Hugo, Walt Whitman, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Robert Browning, and became Kavanagh&#x27;s literary adviser. Kavanagh joined Dundalk Library and the first book he borrowed was &quot;The Waste Land&quot; by T. S. Eliot.

Kavanagh&#x27;s first collection, &quot;Ploughman and Other Poems&quot;, was published in 1936. It is notable for its realistic portrayal of Irish country life, free of the romantic sentiment often seen at the time in rural poems, a trait he abhorred. Published by Macmillan in its series on new poets, the book expressed a commitment to colloquial speech and the unvarnished lives of real people, which made him unpopular with the literary establishment. Two years after his first collection was published he had yet to make a significant impression. The &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; described him as &quot;a young Irish poet of promise rather than of achievement,&quot; and &quot;The Spectator&quot; commented that, &quot;like other poets admired by A.E., he writes much better prose than poetry. Mr Kavanagh&#x27;s lyrics are for the most part slight and conventional, easily enjoyed but almost as easily forgotten.&quot;

In 1938 Kavanagh went to London. He remained there for about five months. &quot;The Green Fool&quot;, a loosely autobiographical novel, was published in 1938 and Kavanagh was accused of libel. Oliver St. John Gogarty sued Kavanagh for his description of his first visit to Gogarty&#x27;s home: &quot;I mistook Gogarty&#x27;s white-robed maid for his wife or his mistress; I expected every poet to have a spare wife.&quot; Gogarty, who had taken offence at the close coupling of the words &quot;wife&quot; and &quot;mistress&quot;, was awarded £100 in damages. The book, which recounted Kavanagh&#x27;s rural childhood and his attempts to become a writer, received international recognition and good reviews. However, it was also claimed to be somewhat &#x27;anti-Catholic&#x27; in tone, to which Kavanagh reacted by demanding that the work be prominently displayed in Dublin bookshop windows.

=== The Emergency ===
The outbreak of World War II (known as The Emergency in the Republic of Ireland) had a damaging effect on the emerging careers of some Irish writers, including Flann O&#x27;Brien as well as Kavanagh as they lost access to their publishers in London and reprints of their books could not be arranged. The Republic, which was neutral during the war, shared a border with Northern Ireland (which, as part of the United Kingdom was involved on the Allied side). There were smuggling opportunities on the border, especially in County Monaghan, which would have been more lucrative than writing at this time. 

In 1939 Kavanagh settled in Dublin. In his biography John Nemo describes Kavanagh&#x27;s encounter with the city&#x27;s literary world: &quot;he realized that the stimulating environment he had imagined was little different from the petty and ignorant world he had left. He soon saw through the literary masks many Dublin writers wore to affect an air of artistic sophistication. To him, such men were dandies, journalists, and civil servants playing at art. His disgust was deepened by the fact that he was treated as the literate peasant he had been rather than as the highly talented poet he believed he was in the process of becoming&quot;. 

During this time he met John Betjeman who was based in Dublin during the Emergency nominally as a press attaché but also working for British intelligence. Betjeman, impressed by Kavanagh&#x27;s wide range of social contacts, his ability to get invited to events, and his political ambiguity, tried to recruit him as a British spy.

In 1942 he published his long poem &quot;The Great Hunger&quot;, which describes the privations and hardship of the rural life he knew well. Although it was rumoured at the time that all copies of &quot;Horizon&quot;, the literary magazine in which it was published, were seized by the Garda Síochána, Kavanagh denied that this had occurred, saying later that he was visited by two Gardaí at his home (probably in connection with an investigation of &quot;Horizon&quot; under the Special Powers Act). Written from the viewpoint of a single peasant against the historical background of famine and emotional despair, the poem is often held by critics to be Kavanagh&#x27;s finest work. It set out to counter the saccharine romanticising of the Irish literary establishment in its view of peasant life. Richard Murphy in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; described it as &quot;a great work&quot; and Robin Skelton in &quot;Poetry&quot; praised it as &quot;a vision of mythic intensity&quot;.

=== Post-war ===
Kavanagh worked as a part-time journalist, writing a gossip column in the &quot;Irish Press&quot; under the pseudonym Piers Plowman from 1942 to 1944 and acted as film critic for the same publication from 1945 to 1949. In 1946 the Archbishop of Dublin, John Charles McQuaid, found Kavanagh a job at the Catholic magazine &quot;The Standard&quot;. McQuaid continued to support him throughout his life. &quot;Tarry Flynn&quot;, a semi-autobiographical novel, was published in 1948 and was banned for a time. It is a fictional account of rural life. It was later made into a play, performed at the Abbey Theatre in 1966.

In late 1946 Kavanagh moved to Belfast, where he worked as a journalist and as a barman in a number of public houses in the Falls Road area. During this period he lodged in the Beechmount area in a house where he was related to the tenant through the tenant&#x27;s brother-in-law in Ballymackney, County Monaghan. Before returning to Dublin in November 1949 he presented numerous manuscripts to the family, all of which are now believed to be in Spain.

Kavanagh&#x27;s personality became progressively quixotic as his drinking increased over the years and his health deteriorated. Eventually becoming a dishevelled figure, he moved among the bars of Dublin, drinking whiskey and displaying his predilection for turning on benefactors and friends.

===Later career===

In 1949 Kavanagh began to write a monthly &quot;Diary&quot; for &quot;Envoy&quot;, a literary publication founded by John Ryan, who became a lifelong friend and benefactor. &quot;Envoy&quot;″s offices were at 39 Grafton Street, but most of the journal&#x27;s business was conducted in a nearby pub, McDaid&#x27;s, which Kavanagh subsequently adopted as his local. Through &quot;Envoy&quot; he came into contact with a circle of young artists and intellectuals including Anthony Cronin, Patrick Swift, John Jordan and the sculptor Desmond MacNamara, whose bust of Kavanagh is in the Irish National Writers Museum. Kavanagh often referred to these times as the period of his &quot;poetic rebirth&quot;.

In 1952 Kavanagh published his own journal, &quot;Kavanagh’s Weekly: A Journal of Literature and Politics&quot;, in conjunction with, and financed by, his brother Peter. It ran to some 13 issues, from 12 April to 5 July 1952.

===&quot;The Leader&quot; lawsuit and lung cancer===
In 1954 two major events changed Kavanagh&#x27;s life. First, he issued libel proceedings against a magazine called &quot;The Leader&quot; for publishing an anonymously-written profile of him as an alcoholic sponger. Kavanagh had made numerous enemies in his film and literary criticism and had written diatribes against the Civil Service, the Arts Council, the Irish Language movement so there were many possible authors of the piece. Based on his previous experience of libel, he believed he would get an out-of-court settlement. However, the magazine hired former (and future) Taoiseach and Attorney General (1926–1932) John A. Costello as their barrister, who won the case when it came to trial. 

Second, shortly after Kavanagh lost this case, he was diagnosed with lung cancer and was admitted to hospital, where he had a lung removed. It was while recovering from this operation by relaxing on the banks of the Grand Canal in Dublin that Kavanagh rediscovered his poetic vision. He began to appreciate nature and his surroundings, and took his inspiration from them for many of his later poems.

Costello and Kavanagh eventually became good friends, with Kavanagh remarking that he voted for him after the trial.

===Turning point: Kavanagh begins to receive acclaim===
In 1955 Macmillan rejected a typescript of poems by Kavanagh, which left the poet very depressed. Patrick Swift, on a visit to Dublin in 1956, was invited by Kavanagh to look at the typescript. Swift then arranged for the poems to be published in the English literary journal &quot;Nimbus&quot;(19 poems were published). This proved a turning point and Kavanagh began receiving the acclaim that he had always felt he deserved. His next collection, &quot;Come Dance with Kitty Stobling&quot;, was directly linked to the mini-collection in &quot;Nimbus&quot;.

Between 1959 and 1962 Kavanagh spent more time in London, where he contributed to Swift&#x27;s &quot;X&quot; magazine. During this period Kavanagh occasionally stayed with the Swifts in Westbourne Terrace. He gave lectures at University College Dublin and in the United States, represented Ireland at literary symposiums, and became a judge of the Guinness Poetry Awards.

In London, he often stayed with his publisher, Martin Green, and Green&#x27;s wife Fiona, in their house in Tottenham Street, Fitzrovia. It was at this time that Martin Green produced Kavanagh&#x27;s &quot;Collected Poems&quot; (1964) with prompting from Patrick Swift and Anthony Cronin&quot;. In the introduction Kavanagh wrote: &quot;A man innocently dabbles in words and rhymes, and finds that it is his life.&quot;

===Marriage and death===

Kavanagh married his long-term companion Katherine Barry Moloney (niece of Kevin Barry) in April 1967 and they set up home together on Waterloo Road in Dublin. Kavanagh fell ill at the first performance of &quot;Tarry Flynn&quot; by the Abbey Theatre company in Dundalk Town Hall and died a few days later, on 30 November 1967, in Dublin. His grave is in Inniskeen adjoining the Patrick Kavanagh Centre. His wife Katherine died in 1989; she is also buried there.

==Legacy==
Nobel Laureate Séamus Heaney is acknowledged to have been influenced by Kavanagh. Heaney was introduced to Kavanagh&#x27;s work by the writer Michael McLaverty when they taught together at St Thomas&#x27;s, Belfast. Heaney and Kavanagh shared a belief in the capacity of the local, or parochial, to reveal the universal. Heaney once said that Kavanagh&#x27;s poetry &quot;had a transformative effect on the general culture and liberated the gifts of the poetic generations who came after him.&quot; Heaney noted: &quot;Kavanagh is a truly representative modern figure in that his subversiveness was turned upon himself: dissatisfaction, both spiritual and artistic, is what inspired his growth... His instruction and example helped us to see an essential difference between what he called the parochial and provincial mentalities&quot;. As Kavanagh put it: &quot;All great civilizations are based on the parish&quot;. He concludes that Kavanagh&#x27;s poetry vindicates his &quot;indomitable faith in himself and in the art that made him so much more than himself&quot;.
The actor Russell Crowe has stated that he is a fan of Kavanagh. He commented: &quot;I like the clarity and the emotiveness of Kavanagh. I like how he combines the kind of mystic into really clear, evocative work that can make you glad you are alive&quot;. On 24 February 2002, after winning the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his performance in &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;, Crowe quoted Kavanagh during his acceptance speech at the 55th British Academy Film Awards. When he became aware that the Kavanagh quote had been cut from the final broadcast, Crowe became aggressive with the BBC producer responsible, Malcolm Gerrie. He said: &quot;it was about a one minute fifty speech but they&#x27;ve cut a minute out of it&quot;. The poem that was cut was a four-line poem:
&lt;poem&gt;
To be a poet and not know the trade,
To be a lover and repel all women;
Twin ironies by which great saints are made,
The agonising pincer-jaws of heaven.
&lt;/poem&gt;

When the &quot;Irish Times&quot; compiled a list of favourite Irish poems in 2000, ten of Kavanagh&#x27;s poems were in the top 50, and he was rated the second favourite poet behind W. B. Yeats. Kavanagh&#x27;s poem &quot;On Raglan Road&quot;, set to the traditional air &quot;Fáinne Geal an Lae&quot;, composed by Thomas Connellan in the 17th century, has been performed by numerous artists as diverse as , Luke Kelly, Mark Knopfler, Billy Bragg, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, Joan Osborne Van Morrison and many others.

There is a statue of Kavanagh beside Dublin&#x27;s Grand Canal, inspired by his poem &quot;Lines written on a Seat on the Grand Canal, Dublin&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt;
O commemorate me where there is water
canal water preferably, so stilly
greeny at the heart of summer. Brother
commemorate me thus beautifully.
&lt;/poem&gt;
This statue is featured in the short film &quot;Yu Ming Is Ainm Dom&quot;, about a Chinese man who learns Irish in order to live in Ireland.

Every 17 March, after the St Patrick&#x27;s Day parade, a group of Kavanagh&#x27;s friends gather at the Kavanagh seat on the banks of the Grand Canal at Mespil road in his honour. The seat was erected by his friends, led by John Ryan and Denis Dwyer, in 1968. A bronze sculpture of the writer stands outside the Palace Bar on Dublin&#x27;s Fleet Street. There is also a statue of Patrick Kavanagh located outside the Irish pub and restaurant, Raglan Road, at Walt Disney World&#x27;s Downtown Disney in Orlando, Florida. His poetic tribute to his friend the Irish American sculptor Jerome Connor was used in the plaque overlooking Dublin&#x27;s Phoenix Park dedicated to Connor.

The Patrick Kavanagh Poetry Award is presented each year for an unpublished collection of poems. The annual Patrick Kavanagh Weekend takes place on the last weekend in September in Inniskeen, County Monaghan, Ireland. The Patrick Kavanagh Centre, an interpretative centre set up to commemorate the poet, is located in Inniskeen.

===Kavanagh Archive===

In 1986, Peter Kavanagh negotiated the sale of Patrick Kavanagh&#x27;s papers as well as a large collection of his own work devoted to the late poet to University College Dublin. The purchase was enabled by a public appeal for funds by the late Professor Gus Martin. Peter included in the sale his original hand press which he had built. The archive is housed in a special collections room in UCD&#x27;s library, and the hand press is on loan to the Patrick Kavanagh Centre, Inniskeen.

The contents include:
* Early literary material containing verses, novels, prose writing and other publications; family correspondence containing letters to Cecilia Kavanagh and Peter Kavanagh; letters to Patrick Kavanagh from various sources (1926–40).
* Later literary material containing verses, novels, articles, lectures, published works, galley page proofs, Kavanagh’s Weekly, and adaptations of Kavanagh’s work (1940–67).
* Documents concerning libel case of &quot;Kavanagh v The Leader&quot; (1952–54).
* Personal correspondence, including with his sisters, Peter Kavanagh, and Katherine Barry Moloney (1947–67).
* Printed material, press cuttings, publications, personal memorabilia, and tape recordings (1940–67).

Peter Kavanagh&#x27;s papers include thesis, plays, autobiographical writing, printed material, personal and general correspondence memorabilia, tape recordings, galley proofs (1941–82) and family memorabilia (1872–1967).

===Copyright===
Ownership of the copyright is vested in the Trustees of The Patrick and Katherine Kavanagh Trust by virtue of the terms of the will of the late Kathleen Kavanagh, widow of the poet, who in turn became entitled to the copyright on the death of her husband. The proceeds of the trust are used to support deserving writers. The Trustees are Patrick MacEntee, Eiléan Ní Chuilleanáin, and Eunan O&#x27;Halpin. This was disputed by the late Peter Kavanagh who continued publishing his work after Patrick&#x27;s death. This dispute led some books to go out of print. Most of his work is now available in the UK and Ireland but the status in the United States is more uncertain.
